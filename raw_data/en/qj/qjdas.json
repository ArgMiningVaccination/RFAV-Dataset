The plan shall cover, at a minimum, stockpile stewardship, stockpile management, stockpile responsiveness, stockpile surveillance, program direction, infrastructure modernization, human capital, and nuclear test readiness. The plan shall be consistent with the pro grammatic and technical requirements of the most recent annual Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Memorandum. Pursuant to previous statutory requirements, the Department of Energy 's National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA ) has submitted reports on the plan to Congress annually since 1998 , with the exception of 2012 .1 The Fiscal Year 20 23 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan (SSMP) is a biennial plan summary report of DOE/NNSA 's 25-year program of record to maintain the safety, security , and effectiveness of the nuclear stockpile and is primarily captured in this single, unclassified document. A classified annex to the SSMP contains supporting details concerning the U.S. nuclear stockpile and stockpile management. 1 In 2012 , a Fiscal Year 2013 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan was not submitted to Congress because analytical work conducted by the D oD and NNSA to evaluate the out -year needs for nuclear moder nization activities across the nuclear security enter prise had not yet been finalized . Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 1-1 Chapter 1 Strategic Context for Managing the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile The U.S. nuclear deterrent is the foundation of the national defense , which backstops U.S. integrated efforts across warfighting domains, other instruments of national power, and the U nited States ' network of alliances and partnerships . While e liminating nuclear weapons has been a goal for generations , current activities by several nuclear powers appear to be at odds with this goal. Russia is relying on nuclear weapons as a means to counter U.S. conventional superiority , replacing Soviet -era systems with new missiles, submarines, and aircraft while developing new types of tactical nuclear weapons. China is tryi ng to broaden its political and economic influence, and in the nuclear arena , is increasing the number and types of nuclear weapons in its arsenal . Further, North Korea has expanded its number of nuclear weapons and range of delivery capabilities , and Iran continues to develop its nuclear program . For the foreseeable future, nuclear weapons will continue to provide unique deterrence effects that no other elem ent of U.S. power can replace given the reality of today's evolving and uncertain international security environment. Ensuring the U.S. strategic deterrent remains safe, secure, and effective, and that the United States ' deterrence commitments to its allies remain strong and credible requires significant and coordinated effort. Responsibility for this mission is shared by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/ NNSA ). Only through the two Departments align ing their priorities, programs, and funding can U.S. nuclear forces meet deterrence and assurance requirements. To execute the Nation's nuclear weapons programs , DOE/ NNSA partners with DoD through the Nuclear Weapons Council on the joint nuclear weapon s life cycle process. DoD and DOE/ NNSA use this process to manage weapons ' sustainment and modernization needs from concept assessment to full -scale production, and finally , to retirement and dismantlement . DoD and DOE/NNSA continu e to make progress across the current major warhead programs as DOE/NNSA continues to perform an unprecedented variety of component development, qualification, system integration, and production activities. The weapons comprising the U.S. nuclear stockpile are currently assessed to be safe, secure, and effective , and DOE/NNSA's infrastructure is currently adequate to support stockpile actions. However, c ontinued science and infrastructure investments are nee ded to ensure the stockpile continues to meet these requirements . For most of the post -Cold War period, the focus of the nuclear security enterprise has been to sustain existing nuclear weapons and improve the ability to assess their safety, security, rel iability, and effectiveness without nuclear explosive testing. When aging issues were identified in the stockpile, weapons were partially refurbished without changing their military characteristics. Additionally, elements of the production infrastructure were dismantled, and other elements were not sustained due to limited needs within the enterprise. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 1-2 Today, much of the stockpile has aged without comprehensive refurbishment. At a time of rising nuclear risks, a partial refurbishment strategy no longe r meets the needs of the nuclear deterrent. To respond to the current environment with a balanced, flexible stockpile , it is important that the nuclear security enterprise 's production infrastructure is re -established, repaired as appropriate, and moderni zed. Recapitalizing the nuclear security enterprise, including the workforce, infrastructure, production capacity and capabilities, and scientific base that support it, is key to ensuring a safe, secure, and effective stockpile. A resilient and responsiv e production capability is necessary for DOE/ NNSA to continue to support the nuclear deterrent and afford the United States the ability to adapt to changes in the strategic environment. Therefore, DOE/ NNSA is currently undertaking a risk -informed, complex , and time -constrained modernization and recapitalization effort to ensure continued mission success, in conjunction with the priorities identified in the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review . 1.1 Overview DOE/NNSA draws authority for managing the Nation's nuclear st ockpile from the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S. Code \u00a7 2011 et seq. ) and, more specifically, the National Nuclear Security Administration Act (50 U.S. Code \u00a7 2401 et seq .). DOE/ NNSA's broad set of enduring mission s are to protect the N ation by maintaining a safe, secure, and effective nuclear weapons stockpile , reduc e global nuclear threats , and provid e the Navy's submarines and aircraft carriers with militarily effective nuclear propulsion . Activities related to DOE/NNSA's stockpile mission conduct are referred to in this document as Weapons Activities. DOE/NNSA's annual Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan ( SSMP ) has two primary purposes: Document DOE/ NNSA's pl ans to : - Maintain the current stockpile - Modernize the stockpile as needed to respond to evolving deterrent needs - Advance the science that enables DOE/NNSA to manage the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile while e mploy ing science -based stockpile stewardship to enhance the potential performance and understanding of the stockpile's aged, modified, or modernized nuclear weapons - Maintain and modernize the supporting infrastructure - Sustain DOE/NNSA's highly skilled workforce necessary for this work Provide DOE/ NNSA's formal response to multiple statutory reporting requirements , which can be found in Appendix A, \"Requirements Mapping ,\" includ ing: - Annual Life Extension Program reporting required under the Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115 -31) - Actual or potential risks to, or specific gaps in, any element of the industrial base that supports nuclear weapons components subsystems or materials, in addition to any mitigation actions needed as requested through Section 3135 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (P.L. 117 -81) Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 1-3 This fiscal year ( FY) 2023 SSMP serves as the annual plan for sustaining the nuclear weapons stockpile required by statute. The 25 -year strategic plan was developed in align ment with strategic guidance , including the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review , the Nuclear Weapons Council's Strat egic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2019 - 2044, the FY 20 20 - 2025 Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Plan , and other policy directives (see Section 1.2). 1.2 Policy Framework Summary The National Nuclear Security Administration Act (50 U.S.C \u00a7 2401, et seq .) directs DOE/NNSA \" to maintain and enhance the safety, reliability, and performance of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, including the ability to design, produce, and test, to meet national security requirements.\" Recently, t he 2022 National Defense Stra tegy and the accompanying Nuclear Posture Review reinforced that the U nited States will maintain nuclear forces that are responsive to the threats we face , and affirmed the following roles for nuclear weapons: Deter strategic attacks Assure Allies and part ners Achieve U.S. objectives if deterrence fails Furthermore, the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review represented a comprehensive, balanced approach to U.S. nuclear strategy, policy, posture, and forces and reaffirmed that maintaining a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent and strong and credible extended deterrence commitments remain a top priority for DoD, DOE/NNSA, and the Nation. 1.3 Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Summary The nuclear stockpile's size and composition continues to change in response to U.S. nat ional security needs , though the average warhead age in the stockpile remains high . Many weapons are considerably past the ir original design life expectancy and require s tockpile management activities to assess their condition and perform additional maintenance and enhanced surveillance to ensure operability and extend weapon lifetimes. With several major warhead modernization activities underway , DOE/NNSA is making significant progress toward reducing the average warhead age , while concurrently looking to meet emerging challenges on a time scale that does not put the U.S. nuclear deterrent at risk . DOE/NNSA is also enhanc ing its science , technology , and engineering capabilities to improve the producti on process es' efficiency and effectiveness . The change in the nuclear weapons stockpile's size and age over time is illustrated in Figure 1-1. The current stockpile consists of active weapons, which are maintained to meet military requirements , and inactive weapons, which are used to augment, or replace, warheads in the active stockpile as necessary . Retired weapons are not included in the count of stockpile weapons . Table 1-1 reflects the major characteristics of the Nation's current stockpile, which is composed of two types of submarine -launched ballistic missile warheads, two types of intercontinental ballistic missile warheads, several types of gravity bombs , and a cruise missile warhead. The classified annex to this plan includes specific technical details about the stockpile by warhead type.

Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 1-5 1.4 Overall Strategy, Objectives, and Prioritization of Weapons Activities DOE/ NNSA continues to execute its long -standing nuclear warhead modernization efforts in conjunction with the modernization of DoD delivery platforms, the nuclear weapons required for those platforms, and the DOE/ NNSA infrastructure needed to produce and maintain t hose weapons. This approach will ensure the necessary flexibility needed for future policy decisions related to nuclear modernization as the United States a djusts to the changing international threats facing the United States and its allies and partners . The nuclear weapons stockpile is currently safe, secure, and militarily effective. However, the United States must continue to invest in weapons and infrastructure modernization programs to provide the capabilities needed to ensure the deterrent's viabil ity into the future. For these reasons , DOE/NNSA continues to look for innovative ways to meet emerging challenges on a timescale that does not put the U.S. nuclear deterrent at risk and to enhanc e science, technology, and engineering capabilities to improve production process es efficiency and effectiveness. Due to the long lead times necessary to prepare and establish nuclear capabilities , the United States will not have the weapons and infrastructure in place to support th e nuclear stockpile unless DOE/NNSA takes action to reestablish and recapitalize these capabilities now. The FY 2023 budget for Weapons Activities includes funding for major nuclear modernization programs and was developed in support of the Administration 's 2022 Nuclear Posture Review : Define the Capability to Effectively Engage and Defeat Hardened and Deeply Buried Targets. The Nuclear Weapons Council established a joint NNSA/DoD Hard and Deeply Buried Target Defeat Team, coordinated through the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Chemical and Biological Defense Programs/Office of Nuclear Matters, to determine future options for defeating such targets. Advance the W87 -1 Modification Program. The W87 -1 Modification Program will replace the aging W78 warhead using a modifi ed existing legacy W87 -0 design and will deploy new technologies that improve safety and security, address material obsolescence, and improve warhead manufacturability. In FY 2022, DOE/ NNSA matur ed select technologies and further ed system test and qualification planning. Develop the W93. The W93 Modernization Program is a new program of record established to support the Navy's identified need for a new reentry body . Anchored on previously tested nuclear components, the W93 will incorporate modern technologies to improve sa fety, security, and flexibility to address future threats . It will be designed for ease of manufacturing, maintenance, and certification. Key nuclear components will be based on currently deployed , and previously tested nuclear designs, and extensive sto ckpile component and materials experience. It will also ensure the continued viability of DoD's operational flexibility and effectiveness as the United States transitions from Ohio -class submarines to a smaller fleet of Columbia -class submarines. The W93 will not require additional nuclear explosive testing to be certif ied. Major Goals of Weapons Activities Ensure the nuclear weapons stockpile continues to meet D oD deterrent requirements while enhancing warhead safety and security Modernize production capabilities and nuclear security enterprise facilities Provide experimental and computational capabilities to support the stockpile annual assessment and certification Recruit, train, and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce to meet mission deliverables Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 1-6 Carrying out the W93 program is vital for continuing longstanding cooperation with the United Kingdom, which is also modernizing its nuclear forces. As an allied but independent nuclear power that contributes to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 's nuclear deterrent posture, the United Kingdom 's nuclear deterrent is critical to U.S. national security. In summary, the United States must continue its ability to maintain and certify a safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal. Synchronized with DoD delivery platform replacement programs, DOE/NNSA will sustain and deliver the warhead s necessary to support the Nation's strategic and non -strategic nuclear capabilities on time by: Completing the B61 -12 Life Extension Program Completing the Alteration 370 Synchronizing DOE/NNSA's W80 -4 warhead with DoD's Long Range Standoff (LRSO) cruise missile program and support ing the Air Force's scheduled LRSO initial and final operational capability dates Exploring future ballistic missile warhead options to meet the required military characteristics based on the threats and vulnerabilities of po tential adversaries , including possible common reentry systems for Air Force and Navy systems DOE/NNSA uses several major strategies to sustain and maintain the stockpile and support the DOE/NNSA mission priorities to maintain the safety, security, and effectiveness of the Nation's nuclear deterrent; strengthen key science, technology, and engineering capabilities; and modernize the nuclear security infrastructure including : Assess ing the stockpile annually through science -based stockpile stewardship : - Assess ing whether the current and future nuclear stockpile 's safety , reliability , and performance can be assured in the absence of underground nuclear explosive testing - Renew ing, develop ing, and enhanc ing scienc e capabilities to assess effects of aging, remanufacture and material options, and evolving threat environments on warhead performance - Develop ing modern materials and design and manufacturing options to enable a more modern and efficient production complex - Maintain ing a nuclear explosive test capability as a safeguard Extend ing the nuclear deterrent 's life through modernizations: - Replac ing obsolete technology - Enhanc ing stockpile safety and security - Meeting military requirements Assur ing the capabilities to support the nuclear deterrent in the near -term and long -term (N ote: These capabilities are discussed in Chapter 3, \"Weapons Activities Capabilities that Support the Nuclear Security Enterprise\"): - Renew ing and sustain ing critical produ ction, manufacturing, and research capabilities - Assur ing a stable, reliable, and trusted domestic supply chain for nuclear weapon components and subsystems Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 1-7 Advanc ing innovative experimental platforms, diagnostic equipment, and computational capabilities: - Keeping technical expertise and capabilities on the cutting edge to support a responsive and resilient enterprise Provid ing safe and secure transport of nuclear weapons, weapon components, and special nuclear materials to meet mission requirements The Integrated Stockpile Model in Figure 1-2 shows how the stockpile cycle 's main activities \u2014plan, modernize, maintain, assess, and certify \u2014link these strategies to sustain the stockpile and support mission priorities. Figure 1-2. Integrated stockpile model Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 1-8 1.5 Summar y of Key Challenges in Executing the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan DoD continues to make progress on the first recapitalization of the triad1 since the end of the Cold War, and this effort cannot be accomplished alone. Consistent, on -going sc hedule integration between the warhead and delivery programs managed by DOE/ NNSA and DoD, respectively, is key to the delivery of timely and cost -effective capabilities that meet the defense needs of the Nation. The partnership between DoD and DOE/NNSA co ntinues to thrive through the interagency Nuclear Weapons Council, which has made tremendous progress to align priorities, schedules, and investments between the Departments to ensure the Nation's nuclear deterrent 's future viability . Nearly all the systems that comprise the current U.S. nuclear deterrent are well beyond their original service lives and further life extensions to meet future requirements are no longer cost -effective. DoD is addressing challenges within its aging nuclea r command, control, and communications system; delivery systems; and platforms, and DOE/NNSA is addressing similar challenges as the nuclear warheads in the stockpile continue to age . Additionally, much of the DOE/NNSA nuclear weapons infrastructure conti nues to require near -term and longer -term investments to provide a safe, and secure working environment with the capabilities and capacities necessary to meet military requirements . As a result, the nuclear security enterprise faces a challenge acquiring and fielding modern replacement systems concurrently in each leg of the triad while also investing in an updated nuclear weapons stockpile and supporting infrastructure. One of the most critical challenges that DOE/NNSA must address is the modernization and recapitalization of existing infrastructure in parallel with increasing mission requirements. Components, subsystems, buildings, and equipment need to be replaced, not just life extended. This necessity is particularly critical for the production facilities and strategic material production capabilities and capacities within the nuclear security enterprise. DOE/ NNSA has resourced plan s to renew the essential time -critical manufacturing capabilities prioritized to meet D oD near -term to intermediate -term warhead deliveries and maintain workforce safety. DOE/NNSA's plan s focus on five areas : Establishing a n 80 pits per year production capability Reestablishing high explosives synthesis, formulation, and production capabilities Modernizing and enhancing the facilities and capabilities needed to meet near - to long -term needs for tritium Modernizing the production capabilities for secondary assemblies, radiation cases, and replac ing the current lithium production facility Modernizing and enha ncing non -nuclear component research, development , testing, and production capabilities Figure 1-3 shows the timeline necessary to meet warhead needs. 1 A combination of platforms and weapons, the three legs of the U.S. nuclear triad (land, sea, and air) , serve as the backbone of America' s national security ( https://www.defense.gov/Experience/Americas -Nuclear -Triad/ ). Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 1-9 Figure 1-3. Timeline for key infrastructure and capability investments for future warheads The nuclear weapons stockpile need s updated technologies that require investment in new processes, technologies, and tools to design , qualify, certify , and produce warheads in accordance with stringent and evolving stockpile specifications and requirements . The increased number of concurrent weapon system builds entail three requirements: - Maturing new options with shortened development cycles - Advancing the ability to predict weapon performance in configurations that were not tested underground - Evaluating t he impact of new materials and processes, reus ing aging components in future systems, and enhancing production throughput Pursuit of only the priority activities described above does not exercise all phases and aspects of the joint nuclear weapons life cyc le. DOE/NNSA must devote some effort to less time -sensitive activities to transfer knowledge and skills to the newer generation of nuclear weapon designers and engineers, accelerate and enhance the weapon life cycle, and strengthen in tegration between DoD and DOE/NNSA to ensure sustain ment of all required capabilities . This continued focus is reflected in the inclusion of Appendix E, which resubmits information on the programs, projects, and activities of the Stockpile Responsiveness Program. The nuclear weapons supply chain availability and t rustworthiness must be sustained to assure industrial base viability and guard against potential counterfeit and sabot age. DOE/NNSA has implemented several initiatives through the Nuclear Enterprise Assurance program to assure supply chain protection. For example, DOE/NNSA's nuclear security enterprise provides the tools and capabilities needed for trusted radiation -hardened silicon microelectronics . DOE/NNSA is installing new tooling and planning recapitalization efforts to extend the life of key and critical facilities to ensure continued capability . DOE/NNSA is also interacting and collaborating with Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 1-10 partners to est ablish research and development efforts that could serve as a future production capability. In FY 2021 DOE/ NNSA developed the nuclear security enterprise industrial base (NIB) monitoring framework to provide for the continued viability of the nuclear weap ons stockpile . This framework takes a holistic approach to monitoring the industrial base that supports nuclear weapons components, subsystems, and materials through the establishment of four pillars. These four interdependent pillars of activities (supply chain, operat ions, logistics, and workforce) function in concert to ensure that challenges to maintaining the stockpile are viewed with a broad lens and that gaps or risk in specific areas relating to the NIB are proactively identified. Many of these challenges within specific areas of the NIB are presented throughout the SSMP, along with ongoing and future mitigation strategies. The monitoring framework leverages the management processes of numerous programs, working groups, and teams across the nuclear security enterprise and continues to evolve to properly account for a continuously changing national security environment. A new addition to the FY 2023 SSMP, Appendix F, provides further details on the framework and DOE/NNSA's approach to monitoring the NIB. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 2-1 Chapter 2 Stockpile Management This chapter summarizes the activities the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) manages to maintain the Nation's nuclear weapons stockpile. These activities include sustaining, modernizing, and dismantling nuclear wea pons; maintaining and modernizing production operations; and optimizing the scientific tools that underpin these efforts. DOE/NNSA coordinates and plans with the Department of Defense (DoD) through the Nuclear Weapons Council to manage the current and fut ure stockpile through four major program areas: Stockpile Sustainment performs single -system and multi - system sustainment activities (i.e., assessment, surveillance, maintenance, and response to emerging issues) for all weapons systems in the stockpile . Stockpile Sustainment includes limited life component (LLC) exchanges, surveillance activities, significant finding investigations (S FI), weapons reliability reporting, and annual assessments that provide a comprehensive understanding of the health of the stockpile. Stockpile Major Modernization includes life extension programs (LEPs), modification programs (Mod) , and major Alts that extend the life of weapons in the stockpile , enhanc e system security and safety features , and address issues related to aging or component obsole scence. It also includes modernization programs that do not constitute a n LEP, Mod, or Alt, but provide a moder nized warhead capability (e.g., the W93). Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) handles dismantle ment of retired weapons and disposition of weapon components , which can generate components and materials for Weapons Activities and other DOE/NNSA mission areas . Production Operations provides DOE/NNSA with a multi -system manufacturing -based program that drives site production base capabilities for warhead modernization activities, weapon maintenance, surveillance, weapon assembly and disas sembly, and weapon reliability and safety testing. Production Operations encompasses sustain ing all weapon systems capabilities that enable weapon production and are not specific to one material stream. It coordinates closely with Production Modernizatio n, which focuses on the special nuclear materials and components (such as plutonium and uranium), as well as non -nuclear component modernization . These capabilities are discussed in Chapter 3. The remainder of Chapter 2 is organized around these four ma jor areas as depicted in Figure 2-1. Stockpile Management Accomplishments Completed Annual Assessment Cycle 26 Achieved B61 -12, W88 Alt 370 , and W87 -1 deliverables Achieved goals for Stockpile Sustainment activities Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 2-2 Figure 2-1. Major Stockpile Management Programs Managing the stockpile requires comprehensive planning for all stockpile elements to integrate these activities with each other and with production capabilities. However, these activities alone cannot sustain the nuclear deterrent. Managing the stockpile also depends on a strong set of enabling capabilities covering the necessary science, technology, design, production, materials, and processes, as well as a workforce with the requisite skill set to execute these tasks. These individual capabilities and the linkages to stockpile management are described in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 and Appendix C of this report address two specific elements of these capabilities \u2014infrastructure and workforce \u2014across all capabilities at an enterprise level, further reinforcing t he need to sustain the health of capabilities used to support the enduring stockpile mission. To achieve success in these areas, it is crucial that every capability listed in Chapter 3 of this Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summ ary (SSMP) is healthy and fully and efficiently executed . 2.1 Sustaining the Stockpile Stockpile sustainment activities are prioritized and performed to ensure the daily health of the stockpile. These activities include surveillance, annual assessments, and r outine maintenance to ensure weapons remain safe, secure, and effective over the projected life cycle. Weapons that remain in the stockpile are eventually updated through modernization programs to address modified military requirements, resolve any anomal ies, and meet updated safety and security standards. These modernization activities (LEPs, Mods, and Alts) are addressed through the Stockpile Major Modernization activities discussed in Section 2.2. 2.1.1 Assessing the Stockpile The status of the stockpile is evaluated through continuous, multi -layered assessments of the safety, security , and military effectiveness of each U.S. nuclear weapon system . The annual stockpile assessment Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 2-3 process evaluates the state of the stockpile by conducting physics and engineering analyses, experiments (such as hydrodynamic and subcritical experiments ), and computer simulation/modeling . Assessments may also evaluate the effect s of aging on performance and quantify performance thresholds, uncertainties, and margins . They assemble a body of evidence to measure performance at the part, component, subsystem, and system levels to determine whether required performance characteristics are met. The processes combine data, analysis , and expert judgment with simula tions and continually advancing capabilities to develop a final evaluation of the stockpile. 2.1.1.1 Annual Assessment The directors of the three national security laboratories conduct independent annual assessment reviews on the state of all stockpile systems for which they are responsible. The Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) is also required by statute (50 U.S. Code 2525) to assess the stockpile each year based in part on inputs from the national security laboratories. This process is not a recertification of the weapons in the stockpile ; it is an assessment of each system's existing certification basis , considering information generated by the SSMP in the past year . Each annual assessment builds on previous years' experience with each weap on system and incorporates new information and state -of-the-art capabilities , from stockpile maintenance, surveillance, experiments, simulations, and other sources to update the technical basis of each weapon system . The assessments and conclusions in th e Annual Assessment Report s are subject to inter -laboratory peer review by Red Teams and subject matter experts appointed by each laboratory's director, program managers, and senior laboratory management. This effort culminates in a written summary and conclusion of the assessments from each laboratory director and the USSTRATCOM Commander, which are included as unabridged attachments to the statutorily required Report on Stockpile Assessments , prepared annually by the Nuclear Weapons Council for formal en dorsement by the Secretaries of Energy and Defense , and submitted to the President. 2.1.1.2 Weapon Reliability Each September, DOE/NNSA publishes the Weapons Reliability Report , which provides an updated summary of reliability and yield characteristics of all weapons in the stockpile. The report 's purpose is to communicate to stakeholders the assessed reliability, reliability risks , and the effects of test limitations. The rep ort is the principal DOE/NNSA report on weapon systems reliability that USSTRATCOM uses for strategic planning actions . The Annual Assessment Review process informs this report, which incorporates data from surveillance activities. 2.1.1.3 Advanced Certification and Qualification Advanced certification develops tools and methods to ensure the safety and reliability of the current stockpile and prospective systems for stockpile modernization without further underground nuclear explosive testing. This subprogram de livers assessment methodologies, diagnostic and experimental techniques, data analysis methods, and assessments of the certifiability of design options for future stockpile needs. Advanced certification activities preserve and reanalyze legacy nuclear tes t data and validate simulation codes and models against improved physics models and hydrotest and subcritical experimental data. These activities enhance DOE/NNSA's understanding of a weapon system's performance and possible failure modes, improve the qua ntification of margins and uncertainties, and improve the fidelity and agility of certification methodologies. DOE/NNSA \"qualifies\" nuclear weapons components, subsystems, and integrated systems to the military characteristics and stockpile -to-target sequ ence (STS) environmental requirements, including normal, abnormal, and hostile environments. Qualification plans for each stockpile system lay out the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 2-4 experimental data, modeling, simulation capabilities, and production data required to ensure system func tionality. While qualification is carried out by each warhead program, Advanced Qualification activities seek to improve qualification methods by anticipat ing needs and develop ing the tools, capabilities, and material fabrication options that will enable qualification of replacement or new materials/components, often with increased responsiveness or enhanced properties. These activities are key to address the qualification challenges for advanced manufacturing methods, for replacement materials, and for new systems architectures. Additionally, the se activities are focused on methods to streamline qualification processes to reduce costs, timescales, resources, floor space , and testers , and to standardize methods and requirements across warhead systems. Advanced certification and qualification activities promote the development of design for manufacturability. Close coordination between materials and components development and between design and production agencies enables design for manufacture. 2.1.1.4 Qua ntification of Margins and Uncertainties Assessing weapon performance requires integrati ng many sources of data and expertise. One way performance is gauged is through the quantification of margins of uncertainties methodology, which evaluates the degree to which a weapon operates within the bounds of specified operating characteristics or requirements. This methodology supports nuclear stockpile decision -making and enables risk-informed decisions. A key metric is the confidence factor , or the ratio of margin (M) to uncertainty (U), M/U. Margin is the difference between the expected value and the minimum value of a parameter to ensure some aspect of warhead functioning is performing properly . Uncertainty is the degree to which these values are known. Stockpile Research, Technology, and Engineering activities (also referred to as Stockpile Stewardship activities) evaluate approaches to increase margin when possible and to quantify uncertainties . These tasks are achieved by performing experiments in areas such as material properties to provide data for improving the reliability of the models and experimental platforms used to simulate warhead operation. In summary, quantification of M/U provides an increased unders tanding of the basis for the assessed confidence in the weapons system performance . 2.1.2 Stockpile Surveillance Surveillance activities provide data to evaluate the safety, security, reliability, and performance of weapons in the stockpile in support of annual assessments . The cumulative body of this data supports future stockpile decisions regarding weapon LEPs , Alts, Mods , or other weapon systems not in those categories based on the assessment activities described above . The surveillance program has six goals: Identify manufacturing and design defe cts that could affect safety, security, reliability, or performance Assess risks to the safety, security, and performance of the stockpile Determine the margins between design re quirements and performance at the system, component , and material levels Identify aging -related changes and trends at the subsystem , component , and material levels Further develop capabilities for predictive assessments and provide lifetime estimates of st ockpile components and materials Provide critical data for the annual Weapons Reliability Report and the Report on Stockpile Assessments Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 2-5 DOE/ NNSA conducts stockpile surveillance through weapon disassembly and inspection, stockpile flight -testing, stockpile laboratory testing, component testing , material evaluation , and test equipment. DOE/ NNSA continually refine s planning requirements for stockpile evaluation activities based on new surveillance information, new diagnostic tool deployment , annual assessment findings, and analysis of historical information using modern assessment methodologies and computational tools. 2.1.2.1 Disassembly and Inspection Weapons sampled from the production lines or returned from DoD custody are inspected during disassembly. Weapon disassembly is conducted in a controlled manner to identify any abnormal conditions and preserve the components for subsequent evaluations. These inspections may detect anomalies that give important clues to the health of the weapons while also a dvancing inspection technologies and techniques that enhance knowledge and understanding of the stockpile . 2.1.2.2 System, Flight, Laboratory, and Component Testing A subset of weapons that have undergone disassembly and inspection ( D&I) are reassembled into joint test assembly (JTA) configurations to represent the original build to the greatest extent possible . Select non-nuclear components from weapon systems are used directly in the JTA, while nuclear materials are replaced with surrogate materials and custom d iagnostic equipment . JTAs may contain extensive telemetry instrumentation to provide detailed information on component and subsystem performance during flight environments. JTA units are delivered to and flown by the DoD operational command responsible f or the system. For each weapon system, JTAs are flown on delivery platforms to gather the information required to assess the effectiveness and reliability of the weapon, the launch or delivery platform, and the associated crews and procedures. System -level flight tests are conducted jointly with the Air Force and Navy. After D&I, certain components of selected weapons are reassembled into test bed configurations using parent unit parts . Stockpile laboratory tests conducted at the subsystem , or component level , assess major assemblies and components and ultimately, the materials that comp rise the components . This surveillance process enables detection and evaluation of the onset of aging, trends , and anomalous changes at the component or material level . Components and materials from the D&I process undergo further evaluations to assess component physical configuration, functionality, performance margins and trends, material behavior, and aging characteristics . The testing can involve nondestructive and destructive evaluation techniques and can be used to aid in develop ing predictive performance and aging models of components and materials . 2.1.2.3 Testing Equipment Testers can be applied to systems, subs ystems, major components, and processes. Testers perform two key functions . First, they provide the mechanical, electrical, and radio frequency stimuli to the system in a specified sequence to evaluate component functionality relative to requirements. S econd, the testers simultaneously collect data on the components ' and subsystems ' performance and for product acceptance. T he data collected are used as input to assess the performance and assert the continu ed certification of the weapon system as safe, se cure, and effective . 2.1.2.4 Anomaly Investigative Process When anomalies that could significantly affect weapon safety, security, reliability, or effectiveness arise in surveillance data or are identified or reported to DOE/NNSA by DoD, technical analyses are conducted to determine whether observations warrant an SFI . SFIs are also opened for anomalies discovered anywhere in the stockpile when unexpected phenomena are observed. Such occurrences are investigated Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 2-6 by the design agency responsible for the anomalous component. Investigations can include modeling of historical data, focused materials experiments, research and studies, major system test replication , and subsystem and subcomponent tests. These SFIs can continue through several annual assessment cycles. SFIs are closed after the impacts to system performance , reliability, or safety have been assessed and follow -up actions are determined , if necessary . A tra cking and reporting system monitors anomalies and SFIs progress from initial discovery through closure , and the status of any corrective actions taken . 2.1.3 Maintaining the Stockpile Maintaining the current stockpile comprises many ongoing activities: Completing LLC exchanges of gas transfer systems (GTS), power sources, and neutron generators , as required, to sustain system functionality Respon ding to emerging issues that do not rise to the level of a major Alt or LEP through maintenance, m inor repairs and rebuilds, incorporation of surety features, and other changes Maintaining production authorization by conducting periodic nuclear explosives safety studies Maintaining s pecialized support equipment, such as custom tooling , for stockpile op erations Provisioning for spare and replacement parts that are consumed in stockpile operations 2.1.3.1 Limited Life Components Weapons contain LLCs that require periodic replacement to sustain system functionality and performance . Age -related changes affecting t hese components are predictable and well understood, and surveillance is conducted to ensure the components continue to meet performance requirements throughout the projected lifetime . Periodic LLC exchanges replace these components at defined intervals throughout a weapon's lifetime. DOE/NNSA produces LLCs and collaborates with DoD to jointly manage component delivery and installation . These components include GTSs, power sources, and neutron generators. Gas Transfer Systems GTSs are designed, produced, filled, and delivered to DoD for existing weapon systems. Modern GTS designs extend LLC intervals and increase weapon performance margin s, thereby improving maintenance efficiency and enhancing weapon safety and reliability. Function -testing life storage units and development hardware validate s performance characteristics and provides research and development (R&D ) to inform current and future GTS designs. New GTS designs are evaluated to verify the GTSs may be loaded in the pro duction facilities and meet weapons systems performance characteristics. In parallel to these R&D efforts, production facilities are maintained for gas-loading operations, GTS surveillance, and tritium recovery from end -of-life GTSs. Power Sources Curre nt and future planned nuclear weapons require compact, highly specialized power sources that meet stringent reliability and performance requirements. Requirements for size, weight, active life, responsiveness, and output are unique to nuclear weapon appli cations and are not readily available from commercial suppliers. This capability supports nuclear weapon s and other national security mission s, includ ing prototyping and parts development, through the full life cycle requirements of power source component s through early -stage R&D and modeling, technology maturation, design and development, production, surveillance, and disassembly. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 2-7 Neutron Generators Neutron generators are highly complex LLCs integral to nuclear weapon function . The DOE/ NNSA neutron generator enterprise, which is an integrated design and production agency, manages the neutron generators' entire life cycle to meet DOE/NNSA's commitments, including scientific understanding through design, development, qualification, production, surveillanc e, dismantlement, and disposal. 2.1.3.2 Integrated Surety Architecture The Integrated Surety Architecture program enhances DOE/ NNSA transportation surety for over -the-road shipments of nuclear weapon s by developing enhanced capability shipping configurations to s upport transportation security. The program is implementing enhanced capability shipping configurations across the stockpile to address the maximum number of future shipments. Integrated Surety Architecture is a DOE/ NNSA requirement for over -the-road shipment of any nuclear weapon planned to be in the active stockpile after 2025.1 2.2 Stockpile Major Modernization Stockpile major modernization activities are performed through a series of planned LEPs, Mods, and Alts enabled by a strong set of science, technolog y, and engineering capabilities. Figure 2-2 displays these plans, which fully reflect the priorities established and formally authorized by the Nuclear Weapons Council. Some modernization programs do not yet have approved first prod uction units but reflect notional first production units , coordinated with DoD , for planning purposes. Figure 2-2. DOE/ NNSA Warhead Activities Currently, the long -term vision for the nuclear weapons stockpile seeks to build additional flexibility for the Nation to enable rapid response to unforeseen contingencies while incorporating features and technologies that enhance safety and security, as a ppropriate and practicable. DOE/NNSA will incorporate flexibility -enabling design strategies and an advanced digital enterprise that promotes system 1 Stated in 50 U.S.C. 2538 (d).

These improvements will enhance the Nation's ability to counter adversaries' capabilities, stockpile aging, and variables associated with supporting U.S. hedge capabilities. Qualification -ready and certification -ready options for materials, components, and systems must be developed to meet resilience requirements for the U.S. nuclear deterrent, and matured in advance to be viable for consideration and available when needed to support Nuclear Wea pons Council down -select decisions, development, and production. The activities that lead to this state of readiness depend on advanced scientific and engineering capabilities that enable design, qualification and certification processes , and improve the responsiveness of the nuclear security enterprise in terms of cycle time and digital design tools. These science -based enabling efforts are described in Chapter 3. 2.2.1 Phase X Process (Nuclear Weapons Life Cycle) The responsibilities of DoD and DOE/NNSA for t he development, testing, and production of proposed nuclear weapons were originally established through the 1953 joint agreement between the then Atomic Energy Commission and DoD, which introduced the concept of weapon acquisition phases. The original agreement was supplemented over the years to clarify various areas of joint departmental cooperation. However, the United States' decision to halt underground nuclear explosive testing in 1992 affected the joint agreement as it was no longer updated regularl y. Emerging DoD requirements for future systems necessitated updated procedural guidelines defining the full seven phase nuclear weapons life cycle. This necessity was accomplished through the recently implemented Phase X Process , which updates the origi nal agreement and the joint DoD and DOE/NNSA procedures governing the full life cycle for nuclear weapons. The updated guidelines also supplement the existing Nuclear Weapons Council -approved Procedural Guideline s for the Phase 6.X Process , which define th e framework for existing nuclear weapon refurbishment activities . The Phase X Process includes procedures for program study, development, production , sustainment, and nuclear weapons systems dismantlement . Joint DoD -DOE/NNSA nuclear weapons life cycle guidelines, including those under the Phase X and the Phase 6.X Processes , support increasing emphasis on modernization activities to sustain U.S. nuclear deterrence priorities and capture DoD -DOE/NNSA best pra ctices for nuclear weapons acquisition and sustainment. The Nuclear Weapons Council's Procedural Guidelines for the Phase 6.X Process provide the framework for nuclear weapon refurbishment activities and will continue to be used, even with the updated Phase X Procedural Guidelines for Phase 1 -7 nuclear weapon design, development, production, sustainment, and dismantlement activities. 2.2.1.1 Phase 6.X Process Nuclear weapons have been historically developed, produced, maintained, retired, and dismantled in a process known as the Nuclear Weapons Life Cycle (now Phase X). This process has not been exercised in its entirety since the end of the Cold War, with the United States executing only Phases 6 and 7 in recent decades. DOE/NNSA's Major Stockpile Modernizatio n activities have been guided by the Phase 6.X Process instead , which was developed for non -routine Alts, Mods, and LEPs and starts from an existing warhead design, rather than being used to develop and field a complete warhead. The phases of this process are very similar to stages 1 -6 of the life cycle. These phases, and the relation of the Phase 6.X Process to the Nuclear Weapons life cycle, are shown in Figure 2-3.

Phase X and Phase 6.X Process es 2.2.2 B61 -12 Life Extension Program The B61 -12 LEP addresses multiple components that are nearing end -of-life, in addition to military requirements for reliability, service life, field maintenance, safety, and use control. The life extension scope includes refurbishment of nuclear and nonnuclear componen ts and incorporates component reuse where possible. With the addition of an Air Force -procured tail kit assembly, the B6112 LEP will consolidate and replace the B61 -3, -4, and -7 bomb variants . 2.2.2.1 Status The B61 -12 received authorization to enter Phase 6. 5, First Production , in fiscal year (FY) 2021, and completed its first production unit in November 2021 . In 2022, the Nuclear Weapons Council formally accepted the B61 -12 into the stockpile and authorized Phase 6.6, Full-Scale Production . The B61-12 LEP required re -planning to allow re -qualification of base metal electrode affected components,2 similar to t he W88 Alt 370. The requalification efforts are on or ahead of the re-baselined plan. 2 In FY 2019 - FY 2020, DOE/NNSA experienced technical issues associated with a limited number of electrical components that affected some production component schedules. This base metal electrode issue led to re -planning of the schedules for both the B61-12 LEP and the W88 Alt 370 programs. DOE/NNSA achieved the first production unit for the B61 -12 LEP on November 23, 2021 Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 2-10 2.2.3 W88 Alteration 370 Program The W88 warhead has been deployed for more than three decades, and several updates are required to address aging issues and to maintain readiness. The W88 Alt 370 Program modernizes the arming, fuzing, and firing subsystem ; improves surety; replaces the conventional high explosive and associated materials; and incorporates a lightning arrestor connector, trainers, joint test assemblies, and associated handling gear. The W88 Alt 370 conversion is scheduled to run concurrent ly with LLC exchanges of GTSs and neutron generators. This program does not extend the life of the warhead. 2.2.3.1 Status The W88 Alt 370 received authorizati on to enter Phase 6.5 in FY 2021 and completed the system -level first production unit in July 2021 . The Nuclear Weapons Council formally accepted the W88 Alt 370 into the stockpile in December 2021 and authorized Phase 6.6, Full-Scale Production, entry in 2022 . The W88 Alt 370 required replanning to allow re -qualification of base metal electrode -affected components, like the B61 -12. Requalification efforts were completed in the third quarter of FY 2021, in accordance with the re -basel ined W80 -4 Life Extension Program The W80 -4 LEP will deploy with the Air Force's Long Range Standoff (LRSO) cruise missile. This integrated program will replace the aging AGM -86 air -launched cruise missile and the W80 -1 warhead. The LRSO will improve the Air Force's capability to defeat adversary Integrated Air Defense Systems by enhancing the bomber force 's delivery and survivability capabilit ies. The W80 -4 LEP is on track to support fielding the Air Force's scheduled LRSO cruise missile initial and final operational capability dates . 2.2.4.1 Status In FY 2019, the Nuclear Weapons Council directed entry of the W80 -4 LEP into Phase 6.3 , Development Engineering . During this phase, weapon system design will continue to be refined. There are four primary deliverables: Baseline design, which will advance production engineering processes Preliminary Design Review and Ac ceptance Group Review, which will indicate DoD acceptance of the baseline design and its associated plan for certification Baseline Cost Report Nuclear Weapons Council approval of the military characteristics and STS The W80 -4 program office anticipates en tering Phase 6.4, Production Engineering , in the second quarter of FY 2023. The L RSO and W80 -4 Life Extension Program joint test teams completed the first powered flight test of a LRSO Cruise Missile with W80 -4 Warhead released from a B -52 aircraft. The missile successfully released from the aircraft, powered its engine, and executed all in -flight maneuvers. A Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) team developed the warhead test asset , an Environmental Test Unit . The Environmental Test Un it successfully executed all pre - arm/pre -release criteria and collected environmental data for the duration of the flight. This is a significant milestone for the joint program and first collection of representative LRSO free flight data, used to populate the W80 -4 STS, define environmental specifications, inform design decisions, and validate computational models. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 2-11 2.2.5 W80 -4 Alteration (S ea-Launched Cruise Missile ) After extensive interagency deliberation and approval of the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review , it was determined that the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile -Nuclear (SLCM -N) program was no longer needed . The 2022 Nuclear Posture Review made this determination in light of the deterrence contributions of the W76 -2 and other capabilities, as well as the program's estimated cost relative to other ongoing nuclear modernization efforts. Therefore, c onsistent with the Administration's 2022 Nuclear Posture Review , DOE/NNSA did not request funding for this program. 2.2.6 W87 -1 Modification Program The W87 -1 will be deployed alongside the W87 -0 on the Sentinel, formerly known as the G round Based Strategic Deterrent . It will replace the aging W78 warhead by modifying the existing legacy W87 -0 design. After the B61 -12 achieves initial operational capability, the W78 w arhead will be come the oldest weapon system in the stockpile and the only system not to have received a major refurbishment or upgrade. Critical W78 components continue to age, while the military requirements for the safety and security features of the W78 warhead have changed since the W78 entered the stockpile in 1979 . The W87 -1 Modification Program will meet DoD and DOE/ NNSA requirements for performance, safety, and security and is slated to deploy on the Sentinel in the early 2030 s. 2.2.6.1 Status Following authorization from the Nuclear Weapons Council in September 2018, the W87 -1 restarted Phase 6.2, Feasibility Study and Design Options , in January 2019 . The program completed 6.2 and entered Phase 6.2A, Design Definition and Cost Study , in the fourth quarter of FY 2021. As of the end of FY 2022, the program is awaiting Nuclear Weapons Council approval to enter Phase 6.3, Development Engineering . DOE/ NNSA previously established a W87 -1 Federal program office along with the requisite sta ff, program plans , and management documents . In 2019, the Nuclear Weapons Council selected a single surety architecture for the W87 -1, and DOE/NNSA continues to evaluate component features through feasibility and trade studies. 2.2.7 W93 Program The W93 will address future Navy ballistic missile requirements. It will incorporate modern technologies to improve safety, security, and flexibility to address future threats and will be designed for ease of manufacturing, maintenance, and certification. All ke y nuclear components will be based on currently deployed and previously tested nuclear designs, and extensive stockpile component and materials experience. It will not require additional nuclear explosive testing to certify. The program will use the Nucl ear Weapon Phase X Life Cycle Process for integrated nuclear weapons system acquisition, rather than the Phase 6.X Process (see Section 2.2.1 for additional information regarding these life cycle processes) . Work in support of the W93 Program will include Phase 1 , Concept Assessment , which evaluate s warhead architectures and available technologies against a potential range of desired attributes, draft military characteristics, and known constraints. It will also inform DoD's program activities for the associated Mk7 reentry body within which the W93 w ould be deployed. Carrying out the W93 program is vital for continuing DOE/NNSA's longstanding cooperation with the United Kingdom, which is also modernizing its nuclear forces. As an allied but independent nuclear power that contributes to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 's nuclear deterrent posture, t he United Kingdom 's nuclear deterrent is critical to U.S. national security. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 2-12 2.2.7.1 Status The W93 completed Phase 1, Concept Assessment , in the third quarter of FY 2022 . The N uclear Weapons Council has authorized the program to proceed into Phase 2, Feasibility Study and Design Options . 2.2.8 Future Warheads DOE/NNSA is coordinating with DoD to define the appropriate ballistic missile warheads to support anticipated future threats. These warheads current ly include the Future Strategic Land -Based Warhead, the F uture Strategic Sea-Based W arhead, the -Delivered Warhead, -Launched Warhead ( to replace the W76 -1/2) that will be needed in the 2040s. 2.3 Weapon Dismantlement and Disposition WDD activities disassemble retired weapons into major components. Those components are then assigned for reuse, storage, surveillance, or for additional disassembly and subsequent disposition of constituent parts and materials. The dismantlement schedule for retired nuclear weapons is planned to provide the materials and components required for the stockpile (in particular, LEPs, Mods, and Alts), and considers the needs of other programs for these materials. WDD also maintains the proficiency of technicians and balances work scope at the production sites. Dismantlement rates are affected by many factors , including weapon system complexity, availability of qualified personnel, equipment, and facilities, logistics, policy and directives, and legislative requirements. DOE/NNSA's current 5 -year Dismantlement Plan balances physical constraints with l egislative, policy, and directive guidance. The WDD work scope includes management of retired nuclear weapon systems (e.g., managing safety concerns), characterization of weapon components, disassembly of weapons and components, and final component dispos ition (e.g., component reuse and material recycle and recovery). WDD activities occur across all sites in the nuclear security enterprise. 2.3.1 Status DOE/NNSA continues to make significant progress on dismantling weapons and component disposition. As noted i n prior SSMPs, DOE/NNSA was on pace to complete the dismantlement of all warheads retired before FY 2009 by the end of FY 2022; however, the global Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic delayed the dismantlement of a small number of these retired warheads unti l after FY 2022. DOE/ NNSA remains committed to completing this effort. In addition, DOE/NNSA has developed return schedules to remove retired weapons from DoD facilities while meeting DoD operational requirements. WDD continues to characterize component s coming off the dismantlement line, and sites are eliminating excess component inventories. WDD Accomplishments Weapon Dismantlement and Disposition team completed over 275 arming, fuzing, and firing tear downs - well above the year's goal of 150. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 2-13 2.4 Production Operations Production Operations provides the base capabilities to enable weapon operations (assembly , disassembly, and production) planned for the warhead modernization , stockpile systems, and the WDD programs . Production Operations ' goal is to maintain the base capability required to sustain a responsive and resilient stockpile through robust managemen t and production process engineering, manufacturing, and production technology resources . The program accomplishes this goal by maintaining the tools and personnel necessary for supporting major manufacturing, assembly, disassembly, maintenance, and produ ction data management for all nuclear weapons in the stockpile and modernization efforts. At individual enterprise sites, Production Operations facilitates the capability and capacity to sustain the nuclear security enterprise's production mission, mainly through sustaining and expanding the multi -program enabling workforce. The base labor capacity the program provides is essential to preventive and corrective maintenance, calibrations, quality assurance, qualification , production logistics, manufacturing execution systems, process flow, and scheduling activities . Production Operations also maintains critical multi -weapon system supporting equipment at certain sites and select programmatic infrastructure. Production Operations also serves as the demand s ignal for the modernization of production capabilities and capacity to improve efficiency and maintain manufacturing operations that will meet future requirements. The program requires close coordination with the Production Modernization and Advanced Manu facturing Development programs, which are charged with development and initial deployment of new , or replacement , manufacturing capabilities. It also heavily depends on required infrastructure modernization to ensure base capabilities with adequate capaci ties, space, and equipment are in place. 2.4.1 Status Production Operations is expanding the nuclear security enterprise's base capability sustainment capacity to meet a significant increase in demand associated with the ramp up in warhead modernization activiti es and Production Modernization projects. As the Production Support program evolved into Production Operations within the Office of Stockpile Production Integration, it has taken on additional scope in enterprise capacity modeling and planning. This emer ging function aligns well with Production Operations' role as a demand signal for modernizing nuclear security enterprise production capability and capacity expansion. Production Accomplishments Sustained base capabilities for multi -system operations and maintenance support to meet all LLC exchange GTS fills and surveillance deliverables KCNSC completed over 1,600 critical equipment calibrations in support of production activities. Supported over 800 LLNL engineering authorizations and 350 product realization team meetings. Accepted over 130,000 SNL components at a 100 percent acceptance rate. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-1 Chapter 3 Weapons Activities Capabilities that Support the Nuclear Security Enterprise Chapter 2 describes how the Department of Energy 's National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA ) fulfills the critical mission to assess, surveil, modernize, and qualify the nuclear weapons stockpile , and certify it is safe, secure, and effective. Chapter 3 f ocuses on the Weapons Activities capabilities required to accomplish this mission. DOE/NNSA delivers the capabilities required for an effective nuclear deterrent that provide s the Nation with the ability to adapt and respond to a dynamic security environm ent, emerging strategic challenges, and geopolitical and technological changes. The Department of Defense (DoD) supplements the Weapons Activities capabilities with specific efforts, including platforms for flight tests. The Weapons Activities capabilitie s described in this chapter directly support 2022 NNSA Strategic Vision Mission Priority #1, design and deliver the Nation's nuclear stockpile . To accomplish this mission, DOE/NNSA must sustain the current stockpile, undertake comprehensive weapons modern ization, recapitalize the nuclear weapons infrastructure, and strengthen cutting -edge science, technology, and engineering capabilities. More than 30 key Weapons Activities capabilities support conduct of the Integrated Stockpile Model introduced in Chapte r 1, Figure 1 -2, and each capability may support multiple parts of this model . This interdependency between model activities and capabilities, and among the capabilities, is described throughout Chapter 3. Figure 3-1 shows the seven interdependent areas, previously termed portfolios , each containing a suite of capabilities that , combined, address a particular aspect of Weapons Activities . While most Weapons Activities capabilities are applicable only to the stockpile mission , many are also used to support nonproliferation, naval reactors, and counterterrorism activities . Examples are discussed throughout this chapter . The nuclear security enterprise elements that comprise Weapons Activities capabilities are illustrated in Figur e 3-2. These elements include the human capital, physical assets, resources, and enabling processes underpinning the Weapons Activities capabilities . All four elements must be sustained , modernized , and advanced to meet current and future missions. The capabilities cannot function as a system if any of these elements are missing. Weapons Activities capabilities require periodic evaluation across all four elements to assess their health and continued investment . That evaluation is reflected in this chapt er and continues in Chapter 4, \"Infrastructure and Operations.\" Key Changes to Weapons Activities Capabilities Revision of capabilities within the Weapon Science and Engineering Area to better align with DOE/NNSA mission -related activities Simplification of the capabilities within the Weapon Material Processing and Manufacturing Area Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-2 Figure 3-1. DOE/NNSA Weapons Activities capability areas Figure 3-2. Weapons Activities capability elements Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-3 Many of the capabilities described below are unique to the nuclear security enterprise . The highly specialized materials, various supply chain component lot sizes, security requirements, advanced computing and research require ments, and stringent manufacturing specifications required for nuclear weapons development and production make the work difficult , or unprofitable , for commercial providers. DOE/NNSA must sustain the health of the Weapons Activities capabilities to continue availability of these niche functions. In addition, the nat ional security requirements for nuclear weapons require trusted domestic vendors for certain materials and processes. This chapter's sections describe the Weapons Activities Capabilities areas , their constituent capabilities, specific support to the nuclea r deterrent mission, and how they link and integrat e with other areas and capabilities. See Chapter 4 and Appendix C for an enterprise -level overview of major infrastructure investments and the supporting workforce tied to Weapons Activities capabilities. In Chapter 4, Section 4.2.1, the programmatic infrastructure investments supporting each capability area are aligned with each of the sections in this chapter. 3.1 Weapon Science and Engineering Area The Weapon Science and Engineering area inclu des the suite of physical sciences and engineering disciplines that comprise the theoretical and experimental capabilities necessary to assess the current nuclear stockpile and certify future stockpile weapons. This portfolio of capabilities is closely linked to the Weapon Simulation and Computing area (Section 3.2) and the Weapon Design and Integration area (Section 3.3). Capabilities in all three areas routinely support efforts in the other two , and a ll three areas are needed to deliver stockpile missio n priorities of assuring an effective, resilient, and flexible nuclear deterrent . 3.1.1 Atomic Physics, Nuclear Physics, Nuclear Engineering, and Radiochemistry Atomic, nuclear, and radiochemical properties relevant to weapons are critical to enhancing predictive capabilities and designing validation experiments that increase confidence in simulation models. New measurements and evaluations of experimental data t hat impact , or inform , weapon properties can reduce uncertainties in predictive simulations and improve reassessments of historic underground nuclear explosive test data used to validate and constrain weapons simulations. Reducing uncertainty is critical to the certification strategy for future stockpile options and assessments of the existing stockpile as weapons age. Atomic physics is the study of interactions among electrons, atomic nuclei, and photons (particularly X-rays). Atomic physics processes, such as X -ray generation, are relevant to the function of nuclear weapons. Facilities such as the National Ignition Facility (NIF), Omega Laser Facility (Omega), Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE), and Z pulsed power facility (Z) provide capabili ties to explore atomic physics processes that occur in nuclear weapons to inform, improve, and validate computational models. Nuclear physics is the study of atomic nuclei and their constituents, while nuclear engineering is the translation of nuclear phys ics principles to the applications of nuclear interactions includ ing fission and fusion. Nuclei undergo complex reaction pathways and provide a significant energy source in nuclear weapons, requiring accurate and precise nuclear data for stockpile perform ance and safety assessments. Nuclear forces are challenging for theoretical understanding, necessitating experimental measurements. Data are collected at large experimental facilities such as LANSCE, other DOE national laboratories (e.g., Argonne Nationa l Laboratory, Berkeley National Laboratory) and academic institutions (e.g., Texas A&M University, Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory). Integral measurements used to validate the nuclear Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-4 data libraries are performed at facilities such as the Nationa l Criticality Experiments Research Center at the Nevada National Security Site. Radiochemistry is the study of radioactive materials and their interactions and is the basis of DOE/NNSA's modern connection to legacy underground nuclear explosive test data. Radiochemical data from the United States' extensive underground nuclear explosive test history database are used to inform modern - day assessments of weapon performance as part of stockpile stewardship. New measurement techniques have enabled analysis of additional reaction products from legacy underground nuclear explosive tests, and the results supplement benchmarking models from those events. Radiochemistry also supports other scientific areas; for example, it is used to develop target materials for nuclear reaction measurements and it is an important element of the diagnostic capabilities used by high energy density (HED) experiments. DOE/N NSA is the nuclear forensics1 lead for the U.S. Government and employs radiochemistry tools to address national security problems. 3.1.1.1 Status DOE/NNSA's atomic physics understanding is strong at the limits of high and low temperatures and high and low densit ies. Between these extremes, there is uncertainty in the fundamental theories, with minimal benchmarked data to inform them. These uncertainties in basic properties lead to increased uncertainties regarding final integrated simulation outputs. A concern for future workforce development and growth in atomic physics is that only a small number of university programs offer relevant training. Over the past decade, nuclear physics experiments for stockpile stewardship have increased in precision and complexit y. New detector systems that use novel materials and modern engineering techniques are enabling unprecedented data precision and providing new data from competing reactions. Coupling nuclear theory to experiments is also expanding predictive methods towa rd determin ing nuclear properties for radioactive materials that are difficult to measure. Support for fast neutron facilities (> 0.1 MeV) remains imperative, as reaction product measurements provide additional accuracy for nuclear data and code validatio n. Nuclear data evaluation is an established methodology that requires high -quality measurements coupled with theoretical reaction calculations to improve predictive simulations. Data evaluators reconcile newly acquired measurements with existing data a nd physics models to determine \"best value\" quantities and uncertainties. Significant investment in training evaluators is essential to providing long -term support to the nuclear data pipeline. The key radiochemical facilities across the nuclear securit y enterprise are in high demand, but they are aging. Some urgent infrastructure needs have been addressed, but additional recapitalization is required to obtain measurements for evaluati ng legacy test data, modern HED experiments, and nuclear data collect ion. Many personnel with the knowledge, skills, and abilities in this specialized field have retired, resulting in knowledge gaps about historical methods. Qualified radiochemists must have specialized knowledge and hands -on laboratory training. While the number of radiochemistry programs at universities has increased, most programs do not address the specific needs of the nuclear security enterprise, necessitating training and knowledge transfer between existing employees and new hires. 1 For further information on DOE/NNSA's nuclear forensics work, refer to NNSA Prevent, Counter and Respond - NNSA'S Plan to Reduce Global Nuclear Threats. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-5 3.1.2 Materials Sci ence, Chemistry, High Explosives and Energetics Science and Engineering , and Actinide Science The Materials Science and Engineering capability aids in understanding how all the materials in a nuclear weapon system perform in diverse and extreme environment s throughout its entire life cycle. This capability plays a key role in resolving stockpile and production issues, validating computational models, and developing new materials (e.g., materials produced through advanced manufacturing or designed to replace environmentally hazar dous and/or difficult to manufacture legacy materials). In addition, Materials Science and Engineering experiments contribute to stockpile surveillance, where the effects of aging materials must be detected and evaluated to support the stockpile annual as sessment. When materials used in the stockpile must be replaced due to aging issues or obsolescence, new materials are developed, studied, and certified for insertion into the stockpile and are vital to extending weapon systems ' life. The qualification o f new or replacement materials reduces risks and may improve the overall safety and reliability of the stockpile. Within the Materials Science and Engineering capability, d ynamic material studies investigate the compressive behavior, structural transformations, deformation, fracture, and chemical reactions that occur in materials subject to impulsive loading. Experimental investigations of the static properties and dynamic response of stockpile materials in relevant regimes requires specialized facilities such as NIF, Z, LANSCE, Joint Actinide Shock Physics Experimental Research , and Technical Area 55 ( TA-55) gas gun facilities. The data generated from these studies is used to create and validate material physics models that contribute to a confident prediction of weapon performance and is increasingly being used for material replacement decisions and to define requirements for components qualification . The High Explosives and Energetics Science and Engineering capability is the study of detonation and deflagration physics, shock wave propagation, and reaction initiation. It includes the study of the design, synthesis, manufacture, inspection, testing , and e valuation of high explosives (HE) and other energetic materials and components for specific applications. Knowledge of HE and energetic materials is crucial to understand nuclear weapon safety and performance. These areas are structured to address challen ges and meet weapon delivery schedules. The Chemistry and Chemical Engineering capability encompasses the study of the fundamental composition, structure, bonding, and reactivity of matter in a given state and under processing conditions. This capability plays a key role in the design and improvement of manufacturing processes for weapon components. It is essential for synthesizing, purifying, processing, and fabricating all of the materials that are currently fielded in stockpile warheads, and it is crit ical for resolving stockpile surveillance issues . It is also necessary for developing and qualifying new materials proposed for near -term warhead modernizations and future system requirements. This capability supports experimental testing and computation al tools that help to understand the chemical reactions that control material creation and compatibility as well as the mechanisms and effects of aging and degradation to ensure the quality, performance, and safety of the current stockpile . Actinide scienc e is the study of physics and chemistry of elements from actinium to lawrencium. This science is important to the understand ing of production, purification, compatibility, targets, and behavior of actinide materials relevant to the stockpile. Overall, the nuclear security enterprise workforce meet s mission needs related to capabilities across materials science, chemistry, and actini de science , and these capabilities come together in support of mission priorities such as new pit production. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-6 3.1.2.1 Status Materials science efforts across the nuclear security enterprise have yielded important results in characterizing current stockpile mater ials under extreme conditions. This capability is strengthened by expanded experimental and computational investigations and enhanced collaborations among DOE/NNSA national security laboratories and nuclear weapons production facilities, sites with experi mental platforms, and networks with strategic academic partners. DOE/NNSA performs Materials Science and Engineering experiments using a broad range of research and development ( R&D ), testing, and evaluation facilities. Experimental facilities are support ed by fabrication capabilities in the complex and with industrial partners. Several new materials and increased scrutiny of how legacy materials change with age are putting significant strain on throughput at existing facilities. The current capability 's scope presents challenges in maintaining an expert workforce and sustaining modern facilities. Developing a sustainable workforce requires active partnering with academic institutions and industry. Furthermore, onboarding that allows significant traini ng time in specialized areas, and stable investments in programs that support foundational applied sciences , are required. Some facilities , such as upgraded plutonium facilities, the new Uranium Processing Facility, and renovated radiological space, have received major capital investments for replace ment . Future investments are needed for the new lithium facility , as well as modernized laboratory space to house radiological and general chemical synthesis. Meeting current and future challenges requir es continued investments in sustaining DOE/NNSA's existing infrastructure and capabilities while transforming relevant infrastructure to be responsive and agile. DOE/NNSA has the Energetic Materials Characterization project underway and plans to recapital ize additional HE facilities to meet these challenges , including the HE Applications Facility, Site 300, and the National Energetic and Engineering Weapons Campus , including the Detonator Production Facility. Several key actinide science facilities across the nuclear security enterprise are in high demand , but they are aging. Some urgent infrastructure needs have been addressed, but additional recapitalization in facilities and key equipment such as accelerators is required to obtain fundamental actinide s cience material properties measurements, to perform evaluations supporting efficiencies in manufacturing, and to interpret legacy underground nuclear explosive tests. Many personnel with the knowledge, skills, and abilities in this specialized field have retired, creating knowledge gaps about historical methods. Qualified actinide scientists must have specialized knowledge and hands -on laboratory training. While the number of actini de science programs at universities has increased, most programs do not address the nuclear security enterprise 's specific needs, necessitating training and knowledge transfer between existing employees and new hires. 3.1.3 High Energy Density Science and Plasma Physics HED Science includes the study of matter and radiation under extreme conditions , including the conditions produced in a functioning nuclear weapon. HED experiments provide data required to validate weapon physics models in simulations tools used to assess the stockpile. Focused and integrated HED experiments provide the data needed to support warhead certification for legacy and new weapon systems. Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) experiments use the extreme conditions of HED states to generate fusion reactions and further expand the range of conditions accessible in the laboratory. HED experiments support scientists ' development and their judgement on weapons -related issues and promote the development of skills in experimentation, design work, fabrication, instrumentation, and other related areas. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-7 ICF experiments compress and fuse light hydrogenic species (deuterium and tritium ), releasing large quantities of energy and neutrons. The design and analysis of these experiments builds understanding of thermonuclear burn and plasma properties, while also providing a driver for the development of new cutting -edge technologies in multi ple fields. The generation of mega -joule yields at the NIF provides a first -of-its-kind capability across the globe to experimentally measure unique temperature, pressure, and density conditions. Understanding the physics of higher yield ICF platforms an d exploring the boundaries of what is possible are key goals for HED Science. Plasma physics is the study of systems containing separate ions and electrons that exhibit a collective behavior. The extremely high temperatures of functioning nuclear weapons generate plasma. Facilities such as NIF, Omega, and Z generate HED states producing data exploring the physical processes that occur in plasma states to validate computational models and improve understanding of matter under HED conditions. 3.1.3.1 Status Across all three major HED facilities (NIF, Z, and Omega), experimental platforms have produced important data relevant to the performance and stewardship of nuclear weapons. HED facilities have also enabled important advances in determining plutonium pro perties at relevant pressures and in addressing key questions on aging and remanufacturing. These advances provide immediate mission support in predictive nuclear weapon performance and are crucial to advancing simulation capabilities in energy densities of interest. One challenge facing the HED and ICF capability is achieving a robust burning fusion plasma, which is the key to enabling technology required to significantly shrink the gap between laboratory experiments and weapons environments. The understanding developed through each stage of experimental performance along the path to a robust burning fusion plasma provides key knowledge and constraining data for simulations, and access to material properties and outputs unachievable anywhere else in the world. In recent years, a focused effort on understanding and scaling all the major HED science platforms will establish a foundation f or next -step decisions on investments and program balance needed to realize long -term stockpile goals for a modern, flexible, responsive, and resilient deterrent. The workforce of scientists with training in plasma physics has become stronger over the la st decade. A concern for future workforce development and growth is that only a small number of university programs offer relevant training, though several of these institutions are offering these c ourses online to reach a broader academic community. The National Ignition Facility conducted a HED experiment using the first -ever shot with explosives. NIF, the world's most energetic laser, conducted the first -ever shot to study a HE sample. The results from the shot will help researchers unlock the mysteries of HE by providing experimental data that quantifies the response of laser -driven HE during reaction. The shot used a non -detonable quantity of an insensitive HE that is used as the main charges in weapons systems. Using HE material at NIF, a radiological fa cility, required careful analysis and preparation. As with other hazardous or radioactive materials, NIF had to develop and implement rigid, formal operational protocols to ensure that the high - explosive experiments would be conducted safely and within NI F's authorized limits of operation. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-8 3.1.4 Technologies to Study Extreme Conditions (Lasers, Accelerators, and Pulsed Power) DOE/NNSA uses lasers, accelerator s, and pulsed power capabilities to support the stockpile in several ways: (1) generating stockpile -relevant environments to qualify materials, components, systems, and hardened electronics in hostile environments; (2) providing static and dynamic material information for weapon assemblies and components that can inform predictive capabilities; and (3) exploring and implementing new opt ions for the stockpile as external threats evolve. Lasers and pulsed -power machines deliver intense pulses of energy into microscopic volumes. Within the nuclear security enterprise, these capabilities are used to generate and probe HED conditions simila r to those produced when a nuclear weapon is detonat ed. These technologies support studies that affect design codes enhancement , new components and systems qualification , and improvement of weapon performance assessments. Experiments on the various facil ities directly inform material choices for warhead modernizations and resolve stockpile questions. Laser -driven facilities such as NIF and Omega are complemented by pulsed -power facilities such as Z ; they provide important complementary HED data as well as unique HED conditions with distinct characteristics. The combin ed capabilities from these two approaches to producing HED conditions work together to generate a spectrum of material and physics regimes needed to study the environments ' experiences by nuclear weapons upon detonation , including components and materials aging , weapon -relevant materials performance under hostile environments, and components and systems survivability . Accelerator technology supports the stockpile by providing high -fidelity static and dynamic material information for weapon assemblies and components, imaging subcritical experiments in real time, and providing unique high -energy particle beams for various other activities. Accelerator technology uses high -volta ge pulsed power to accelerate charged particles to generate high -energy X -rays, protons, and/or neutrons that probe objects in weapon -relevant experiments. These pulses of high -energy particles can also be used as a radiographic source for dynamic imaging diagnostics. Accelerator technology is a critical component of the Scorpius project at the U1a Complex (U1a) , the Dual -Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test facility (DAR HT), the Flash X -Ray capability at the Contained Firing Facility (CFF) , and LAN SCE. 3.1.4.1 Status Over the past decade, U.S. HED facilities have achieved unprecedented levels of performance and efficiency. Maintaining and enhancing this capability as equipment and facilities reach their intended service lifetime is a challenge. The NIF, Z, and Omega facilities are reaching a point where some subsystems and components are reaching obsolescence, and locating suitable replacements and vendors , is becoming an issue. Recapitaliz ing these facilities and equipment with minimal pause in operations will be necessary to sustain a key role in maintaining a strong deterrent. Today, p ulsed power accelerator technology is employed to generate data needed to qualify weapon components and assess weapon performance, which was formerly only possible via unde rground nuclear explosive tests. The Nation's accelerator and pulsed power facilities are aging (e.g., CFF/Flash X -Ray, DARHT, and LANSCE), and cannot provide the full range of test capabilities needed to assure the future viability and reliabi lity of the stockpile. These test capabilities include a combination of the environments that weapons may experience during use. Additionally, accelerator facilities such as LANSCE are essential to the ability to probe the characteristics and performance of materi als for the evolving deterrent. The front end of the LANSCE accelerator is 50 years old and based on technology that is nearly a century old . Further, many of the LANSCE components are reaching obsolescence and becoming increasingly challenging to maintain. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-9 Modernization of LANSCE and investments in national light source facilities tailored to stockpile applications would support obtain ing the material and nuclear science data needed for the deterrent. 3.1.5 Advanced Experimental Diagnostics and Sensors The Advanced Experimental Diagnostics and Sensors capability provides the technology to make detailed measurements of materials, objects, components, system as semblies, and dynamic processes that are critical to weapon performance, other national security applications, and HED science. The data are vital to understanding material and system behavior across requisite environments and in the extreme conditions re ached in nuclear weapons. For dynamic material experiments, new diagnostics provide data vital to understanding material behavior in the extreme conditions reached in nuclear weapons. In the HED field, advanced diagnostics are necessary to improve unders tand ing of weapon science experiments and implosions, and to acquir e the high -fidelity data required to validate aspects of stockpile stewardship computational capabilities. As HED facilities increase yields, additional diagnostics must be developed to operate at higher yields and study plasma behavior achieved in the laboratory. The breadth of experiments performed at Hydrodynamic and Subcritical Experiments (H SE) facilities is increasing and developing a broader range of higher performanc e diagnostics is key to generating high -quality data for the weapons programs. Diagnostic development activities are linked closely to other enterprise mission needs, and individual diagnostic requirements can vary drastically. Time scales can vary from m icroseconds to picoseconds and length scales can vary from meters to microns. Different technologies need to be developed to investigate this wide range of parameters. Accurate diagnostic measurements of shocked material experiments and HED science exper iments are critical to constrain the simulations used to underwrite the nuclear stockpile. 3.1.5.1 Status DOE/NNSA has developed transformative, next -generation diagnostics across weapons science and engineering capabilities . These diagnostic capabilities now con tribute to a better understanding of weapon performance, including the dynamic materials and components response in relevant weapon environments. This response has led to new insights on plutonium aging and is being used to improve models that inform plut onium lifetime assessments. Advances in diagnostics ha ve also enabled recent experiments to determine the effects of new manufacturing processes for components in future warhead systems. With these new techniques, uncertainties can be reduced , and more i nformed decisions can be made when changes to the stockpile are needed. However, a broader range of higher performance diagnostics are still needed to address the increasing breadth of experiments and provide high -quality data for the weapons programs. As HED facilities increase yields, new diagnostics must be developed to study new plasma conditions that are being created in the laboratory. Higher fidelity diagnostic measurements, improved calibration capabilities , and new techniques must also be developed to obtain higher spatial and time resolution to better understand the evolution of implosion and shock -driven phenomena. In order to meet these challenges, a National Diagnostics Working Group of over 100 scienti sts from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL ), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL ), and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), together with national laboratory and academic partners Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ), meet annually to develop and implement multi -year plans to develop advanced diagnostics . Continual improvement of experimental diagnostics and sensors is an en during need to ensure advances in stockpile science and drive down and quantify simulation uncertainties. Experimental diagnostics also push the boundary of what is possible and inspire concepts for future experimental advances. To support Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-10 this, DOE/NNSA continue s to invest in four areas: (1) infrastructure to support the continued health of existing diagnostics; (2) hiring and training the next generation of diagnostic scientists who will push the frontier of measurement science; (3) supporting the suppl y chain of specialized equipment uniquely required for HED and HSE diagnostics; and (4) development of advanced and transformational diagnostics. 3.1.6 Hydrodynamic and Subcritical Experiments The HSE capability provides data on the behavior of imploding primaries without creating nuclear yield, providing vital data on material behavior under low energy density extreme conditions. The combination of hydrodynamic testing with surrogate materials and su bcritical experiments with plutonium provides important data to build and validate weapon design and safety simulation capabilities. HSE are used to characterize nuclear weapon s' primary performance and safety and to assess the effects of findings from st ockpile surveillance. The data are used for the stockpile annual assessment and certification decisions before a weapon enters the stockpile. These experiments are also used to assess the effects of aging components and their potential replacements in wa rhead modernizations and effects on weapon performance and potential design changes, material substitution, and component changes. 3.1.6.1 Status The National Hydrodynamic Testing Complex consists of open -air, contained, and underground facilities at several NNSA sites to provide the experimental infrastructure for hydrodynamic and subcritical experiments. These specialized facilities are operating at near capacity and the complex is aging . The demand for a higher cadence of experimental data collection required by multiple DOE/NNSA programs stresses the physical infrastructure and the workforce. Additional investments would allow DOE/NNSA to meet a greater demand and to maintain the equipment, facilities, and people underpinning this capability. The weapon programs supported by the HSE capability require more and higher -resolution data, necessitating increased testing and enhanced or novel diagnostic measurements. Highe r-resolution data are needed to validate higher -fidelity, more -predictive computational simulation capabilities used to certify primaries without underground nuclear explosive tests. Because of the high -hazard nature of these integrated experiments, progr ammatic needs must be met while ensuring the protection of DOE/NNSA's staff, the environment, and the public. A new, more capable accelerator is being developed for the Enhanced Capabilities for Subcritical Experiments (ECSE) project to deliver images show ing the final implosion stages of plutonium , which currently is not possible using existing radiographic capabilities. Complementary neutron diagnostic capabilities are also being developed as part of the ECSE project for deployment in underground subcrit ical experiments. The U1a Complex Enhancements Project provides the U1a with the infrastructure to house and field multi - pulse radiography and reactivity diagnostics to support ECSE. This project includes the structures, systems, and components necessary for deploy ing the ECSE Advanced Sources and Detectors Project's pulsed X -ray radiography equipment and future neutron diagnosed subcritical experiments technology that will provide valuable data on the phenomena associated with the final stages o f a weapon implosion. Future advanced radiographic concepts actively under development include cinematographic radiography (\"X-Ray movies\") for a potential second axis at the CFF or upgrade to DARHT axis -1. Additional HSE capabilities under development include a multi -axis tomographic system based on laser radiography. Both would deliver enhanced capabilities enabling a responsive assessment of the current stockpile and certification of future systems.

At this scale, a material's structure strongly influences macroscopic behaviors and properties. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-16 3.2 Weapon Simulation and Computing Area The Weapon Simulation and Computing area includes high -performance computers, weapons codes, models, and data analytics used to assess nuclear weapons and components ' behavior . It must calculate with sufficient resolution and complexity to simulate and as sess weapon systems, components, and fundamental science processes that are critical to nuclear weapon performance. The Weapon Simulation and Computing area is closely linked with the Weapon Design and Integration area (Section 3.6) and Weapon Science and Engineering area (Section 3.7) in an iterative fashion, such that capabilities in all three area s are routinely supporting efforts in the other two. 3.2.1 High Performance Co mputing High performance computing (HPC) involves software, hardware, and facilities with sufficient capability and power to achieve the dimensionality, resolution, and complexity in simulation codes to accurately model the weapon systems and components ' performance and the fundamental physical processes critical to nuclear operation. It also includes R&D in computer architecture design and engineering, data management and analytics, and mathematical sciences to support developing and operatin g the HPC systems. For DOE/NNSA, a HPC platform means an integrated system of hardware and software that comprehensively provides the required computing environment, classified and/or unclassified, in which a weapon analyst or designer can run simulation s and analyze results. It is not just a computer , it is a host of hardware and software components (e.g., compute and login nodes, networks, file systems, long -term storage, operating systems, compilers, numerical libraries, developer tools, etc.), often developed independently from one another by component vendors and deployed by the HPC system integrator . 3.2.1.1 Status As detail levels increase in simulation codes, especially those with three -dimensional features, run times to reach solution increase dramatical ly. Th ese heightened run times present an increasing challenge in providing mission and experimental needs support in a timely fashion . DOE/NNSA continues to follow its clearly defined strategy of upgrading HPC platforms at regular intervals to address this challenge . This platform strategy is built around deploying a set of platforms that strike a careful balance among delivering reliable production cycles, pushing the boundaries of current technology, and looking beyond the horizon to what is coming next. This approach to balanced risk has served DOE/NNSA well over the previous decades. As a result, the Weapon Simulat ion and Computing area will retain the Commodity Technology Systems, Advanced Commodity Technology Systems Commodity Technology Systems are workhorse production, general -purpose systems that provide stable computing power to the nuclear security enterprise's design and analysis community through deployments at each of the three laboratories. These systems run the tri -lab software stack and persistent common software environment, with capability for back -up, data recovery, and remote mission continuation in case any of the NNSA labs' computing centers become unavailable for an extended period. Advanced Technolog y Systems Advanced Technology Systems represent the most significant investments for the Advanced Simulation and Computing ( ASC) program in simulation capability. These are leading -edge architectures that are capable of solving the most demanding simulations in DOE/NNSA's mission. They incorporate newer technologies that push the limits of the ASC program in terms of facility requirements, software infrastructure, and applications. Advanced Architecture Prototype Systems Advanced Architecture Prototype Systems consist of node -level testbeds, system -level prototypes, and pre -commercial hardware/scaled -up systems. The goal of these prototype systems is to reduce the risk in deploying unproven technologies by identifying gaps in the hardware and software ecosystem and making focused investments to address them moving from small -scale testbeds to potentially large -scale systems production computing. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-17 Technology Systems, and Advanced Architecture Prototype Systems in its platform strategy. All these systems are focused on delivering production computing cycles to the DOE/NNSA mission. HPC platforms are also evolving in response to the computer industry's movement toward heterogeneous computing in which accelerators, such as graphics processing units, are combined with traditional central processing units to grow computing capa city. In addition to using heterogeneous architectures, the computing industry has evolved new technology models that are more energy efficient . They have also developed artificial intelligence and cognitive simulation capabilities and infrastructure tha t greatly magnify traditional simulation 's capabilities . An integrated approach is key to incorporating advanced technology innovations to support the future mission. Artificial intelligence technologies, for example, have the potential to transform all aspects of this area through coordinated code and platform evolution . Quantum computing ,3 which is even more forward -looking, could have a similar effect but will require more focused attention from DOE/NNSA to explore the potential benefits these new technologies could provide to the weapons missions. Deploy ing more advanced platforms also cr eates increased demand on supporting infrastructure. Power, cooling, and mechanical requirements have grown dramatically with the introduction of exascale computing and are being addressed through minor construction projects and construction line items. The Exascale Computing Facility Modernization project is a construction line item that upgrade d the LLNL computing facility with increased power and cooling capability in preparation for DOE/NNSA's first exascale system, El Capitan, to be deployed in fisca l year ( FY) 2023, and subsequent exascale -class architectures. Exascale Computing Facility Modernization provide s sufficient cooling and power to allow initial installation and necessary systems overlap as they are sited and decommissioned. The nuclear security enterprise will continue to manage and coordinate code development and facility upgrades with system acquisitions to allow HPC platforms use for DOE/NNSA as the technology progresses into the exascale era and beyond. 3.2.2 Simulation Capabilities for We apon Science, Engineering, and Physics Advanced HPC and simulation codes, models, and data analytics used to simulate and assess the behavior of nuclear weapons and their components form another important part of the Weapon Simulation and Computing area . Together, these capabilities enabl e weapon designers to qualify components, certify warheads, and assess the stockpile in the absence of underground nuclear explosive tests. These capabilities support accelerated nuclear weapons design and production, man ufacturing process development, and prediction of weapon response to hostile environments, and play a central role in assessing the nuclear explosive package 's performance and safety and the reliability of the full warhead system in the stockpile -to-target sequence (STS) environments. These codes must also be sufficiently flexible and adaptable to run on a variety of the latest HPC platforms. These capabilities underpin DOE/NNSA's ability to resolve challenging stockpile problems using c odes that take advantage of increased spatial and temporal resolution, higher dimensionality, and higher -fidelity physical models. Code improvements lead to more predictive simulations that are less reliant on empirical calibration to experimental data. These capabilities are essential to address ing issues associated with an aging stockpile and moderniz ing the stockpile with new materials in different configurations without resorting to nuclear explosive testing. The nuclear security enterprise also reli es on these capabilities to continue developing methods for quantifying critical margins and uncertainties (see Chapter 2, 3 Quantum computing - The area of study focused on developing computer technology based on the principles of quantum - mechanical theory, which explains the nature and behavior of energy and matter on the atomic and subatomic level. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-18 Section 2.1.1). These methods are important for understanding discrepancies between physical measurements and simulated data. 3.2.2.1 Status Simulation codes include integrated design codes (IDCs) that perform large -scale, multi -physics simulations direct ly support ing the assessment mission, and weapons science codes that model specific phenomena in more detail and inform the models in the IDC s where experiments are lacking. As the Nation's nuclear stockpile evolves to support a responsive and resilient nuclear deterrent, so must the simulation capabilities underwriting that stockpile. Simulations with improved predictivity that support stoc kpile certification and modernization also address significant finding investigations, and safety scenarios rely ing on large ensembles of multi -physics, three - dimensional calculations with large data movement requirements. Newer generations of IDCs and supporting codes are being designed to respond to evolving requirements. Improved physical models are needed to address response s to hostile environments and analyses of manufacturing, production, and disassembly processes to reduce cost and waste. Future rewrites to accommodate new technologies will be expedited through careful modular design and adaptable programming models. IDCs and weapons science codes are supported by experimental activities designed through close cooperation between the simulation and experimental communities. Simulations, especially those resolving three -dimensional features, currently require an extended time to complete on petascale machines. As the simulation detail increases into the mesoscale, exascale -class computing will b e required to resolve these simulations in a responsive timeframe to support experimental needs (see Appendix C for detailed information on the Exascale Computing Initiative). In response, DOE/NNSA initiated develop ing a new generation of IDCs, requiring new capabilities in numerical methods, software design, and programming models to optimize the use of these emerging HPC technologies. DOE/NNSA has also introduced an Advanced Machine Learning Initiative to expand the use of artificial intelligence, or Cognitive Simulation capabilities, to better manage the complexity in physics -informed simulations The DOE/NNSA is also advancing several internal initiatives to leverage developing technologies and capabilities to support the nuclear stockpile sustainment . The Large -Scale Calculations Initiative, which is currently underway, was initiated to determine the limitations and scaling potential of DOE/NNSA's assessment capabilities. The Large -Scale Calculations Initiative is assessing what is achiev able with current platforms, codes, and qualified personnel and what cannot be achieved with those capabilities. \"Large - scale calculations,\" as defined by this initiative, are impractical to perform on available capacity computing platforms due to size, r un length, or a combination of the two. The initiative directs the national security laboratories to look beyond current computing abilities and ask how calculations on this scale enhance mission deliver y. 3.2.3 Challenges and Strategies Table 3-2 provides a hi gh-level summary of the Weapon Simulation and Computing area challenges and the strategies to address them.

ASC = Advanced Simulation and Computing HPC = high performance computing IDC = integrated design code Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-20 3.3 Weapon Design and Integration Area The Weapon Design and Integration area encompasses the capabilities needed to design, test, analyze, qualify, and integrate components and subsystems into weapon systems that will meet all military requirements and endure all predicted environments and to validate and verify they will always work as expected and never work when not intended. The Weapon Design and Integration area is closely linked to the Weapon Science and Engineering and Weapon Modeling and Simulation areas in an iterative fashion, such t hat capabilities in all three areas routinely support efforts in the other two. 3.3.1 Weapon Physics Design and Analysis Design ing and analy zing the nuclear explosive package is required to assess U.S. nuclear weapons, qualify and certify changes to the stockpile (such as with life extensions and modernization), evaluate proliferant nuclear weapon programs, and respond to emerging threats, unanticipated events, and technological innovation. This capability includes potential concept exploration to satisfy requirements and detailed development of design, production, certification, and development processes. It also encompasses evaluati ng weapon outputs and effects. Weapon Physi cs Design and Analysis efforts are predicated on codes developed through the Weapon Modeling and Simulation area and the nuclear data and material properties that underpin simulation tools. Validati ng and improv ing these tools also requires data and knowl edge acquired through hydrodynamic, subcritical, and HED experimental facilities and legacy data from nuclear explosive testing. Advances in diagnostics and experimental capabilities are required to obtain suitably high -fidelity data . All these related c apabilities underpin and are critical for the Weapon Physics Design and Analysis capability. 3.3.1.1 Status The Weapon Physics Design and Analysis capability provides the foundational tools and methods necessary to design and analyze nuclear explosive package s and determine the state of constituent materials and components and certify potential future stockpile options with new safety and security features. Requirements for DOE/NNSA's current systems will evolve in the future due to component aging or remanufac ture, the changing threat environment, or the need to transition to alternate materials and technologies. In these future scenarios, Weapons Physics Design and Analysis tools will require expanded predictive capabilities to assess , and certify , system performance without nuclear explosive testing. In addition, t he planned warhead modernization requirements over the next decade have expanded. The ability to provide timely analysis to support warhead development timelines is critical. DOE/NNSA must develop new, highly capable methods for certifying designs that differ from those for which DOE/NNSA has a nuclear explosive test history. The national security laboratories are developing non-nuclear experimental capabilities and evaluation metrics that can quantify predictions and uncertainties for performance and safety without the need for underground nuclear explosive tests. 3.3.2 Weapon Engineering Design, Analysis, and Integration The Weapon Engineering Design, Analysis, and Integration capability underpins DOE/NNSA's ability to develop, test, qualify, and certify designs to support a responsive deterrent. This capability employs science, technology, and engineering methods so that the integrated solution meets all performance, safety, security, an d reliability requirements. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-21 This capability affects several phases of the weapons life cycle, including concept exploration, design, development, and production. It also encompasses systems integration, which includes working with DoD to define the func tional, physical, performance and interface requirements between the DOE/NNSA and DoD systems. DOE/NNSA uses that understanding to develop the subsystem -level requirements among the non -nuclear subsystems and the requirements between the non -nuclear compo nents and the nuclear explosives package. 3.3.2.1 Status While much of the Weapon Engineering Design, Analysis, and Integration capability is being exercised by multiple concurrent life extension programs ( LEPs ), Modification Programs (Mods) , alterations ( Alts), and stockpile sustainment, some elements are not b eing adequately exercised. Because modernization activities prior to the W87 -1 Mod have been focused on extending the life of current stockpile weapons, there has been a decline in capacity to develop warhead concepts to address military requirements that differ from those addressed by current stockpile systems. These gaps will be closed through activities supporting the Stockpile Responsiveness Program by exercising the technical capabilities required for all nuclear weapon stages, including design, test ing, and production, and working in concert with DoD to recruit, train, and retain the next generation of weapon designers and engineers. DOE/NNSA is addressing challenges within digital engineering through initiatives to define where specific digital tran sformation opportunities provide value over time and determine where and how changes should be made in policy and business processes for the use of digital product definition and associated data. Any transformation will require investment decisions in sof tware and information technology (IT) infrastructure. 3.3.3 Environmental Effects Analysis, Testing, and Engineering Sciences The Environmental Effects Analysis, Testing, and Engineering Sciences capability uses an array of test equipment, modeling tools, and techniques to simulate STS environments and measure the response of materials, components, and systems. Examples of environmental testing and modeling conditions (normal, hostile, and abnormal) include shock, vibration, radiation, acceleration, temperatur e, electrostatics, and pressure. The engineering sciences that support this analysis include thermal and fluid sciences, structural mechanics, dynamics, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, radiation transport and disposition, and electromagnetics. This capabili ty influences the design and qualification of planned and future weapon programs, as well as surveillance activities supporting assessment of the safety, security, and reliability of the stockpile. 3.3.3.1 Status As the vision for a future stockpile takes shape, c urrent engineering sciences, experimental capabilities, and predictive modeling capabilities may not be sufficient to address future needs confidently and comprehensively. DOE/NNSA's facilities, equipment, and the workforce must be ready and responsive to upcoming needs. Modeling and simulation capabilities must be able to predict the effects of the STS environments. Experimental capabilities are necessary to improve the levels of confidence in all modeling and simulation capabilities. DOE/NNSA has been anticipating such changes, and plans are in place to address those needs. Digital Engineering Digital engineering has empowered a paradigm shift from the traditional design - build -test methodology to a model - analyze -build methodology. Instead of expensive and lengthy design -build -test cycles, the goal is to replace the need for repeated build -test cycles with simulation and analysis in a virtual environment. This new methodology requires that simulation models to be calibrated and qualified in small scale tests before hand. The growing ASC Exascale capability combined with artificial intelligence will accelerate this digital engineering revolution. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-22 Renewed modernization activities and increasing technical requirements have accelerated the need to recapitalize and modernize experimental facilities. Many environmental test faci lities are beyond their projected design life and need major refurbishment over the next decade, especially considering the heavy demand imposed by multiple concurrent weapon programs. The same is true for the programmatic equipment supporting the environ mental test and engineering sciences facilities. For example, DOE/NNSA is currently evaluating options for Combined Radiation Environments for Survivability Testing through an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). This new capability will support DOE/NNSA test ing in multiple radiation environments using the same experimental platform, either through recapitalizing existing facilities or constructing new facilities. 3.3.4 Weapons Surety Design, Testing, Analysis, and Manufacturing The Weapons Surety Design, Testing, Analysis, and Manufacturing capability includes safety and use control system development, analysis, integration, and manufacture to simultaneously minimize the probability of unauthorized use and maximize the reliabilit y of authorized use of a U.S. nuclear weapon while maintaining the highest levels of safety. All these actions are necessary for a safe and secure stockpile. In addition, a ll aspects of this capability require elevated classification control and secure facilities and equipment for surety feature design and manufacturing . National requirements from Presidential Directives have been implemented through DOE Orders, and performance -based use control requirements introduced by the Deputy Administrator for Def ense Programs. These requirements have driven a novel approach to surety designs that are more cost -effective with lower manufacturing complexity while maintaining the stockpile's high surety standards. DOE/NNSA performs assessments that integrate weapon and venue security and control capabilities to understand how to best allocat e resources to meet evolving threats. This approach includes partnerships across DOE/NNSA and the U.S. Government with stockpile and modernization programs, nuclear counterterror ism and incident response personnel, and other national assets. The Optical Initiation project is one example that incorporates surety technology to meet safety requirements. 3.3.4.1 Status A variety of surety technologies and approaches have been , or are , currently under development to improve the safety and security of nuclear weapons. The program's focus is on cost reduction of components and tailoring the technology options to expectations of future systems. Several core technologies have been identif ied for cost reduction efforts and experiments have proven out the complexity reduction. Close collaboration with the production sites has resulted in greater maturity for cost estimates. Additionally, several novel approaches for various applications ar e being evaluated for viability and feasibility. The new approaches represent a paradigm shift in how weapons surety is evaluated. 3.3.5 Radiation -Hardened Microelectronics Design and Manufacturing This capability includes research, design, production, and tes ting of reliable and robust radiation - hardened microelectronics for use in nuclear weapons. The electronics in nuclear warheads must function when subjected to a range of radiation sources from within the weapon to cosmic rays and hostile sources external to the weapon. Radiation -hardened microelectronics perform critical sensing and arming, fuzing, and firing functions so weapons work as intended. As operational environments evolve and new requirements emerge, DOE/NNSA R&D resources must evaluate and re spond to support the safety, security, and effectiveness of the Nation's nuclear deterrent. Production must also keep pace with evolving trends in Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-23 microelectronics production to maintain a trusted supply of hardened microelectronics for nuclear weapon app lications. DOE/NNSA has developed a Microelectronics Capability Development Roadmap that was informed by DOE/NNSA's continued coordination with DoD. DOE/NNSA is engaged with the Strategic Radiation Hardened Electronics Council, the Test and Evaluation, Recruitment and Retention, and Advanced Packaging working groups and is the co -lead for the Trust, Assurance, and Nuclear Surety working group. 3.3.5.1 Status The Microsystems, Engineering and Sciences Applications (MESA) complex is the enduring lead institution for trusted, strategic radiation -hardened microelectronics. DOE/NNSA is committed to sustaining this capability through 2040 via implementation of the MESA Extended Life Program, which includes facilities and equipment upgrades to maintain and advance cap abilities for all active weapons systems, such as the W87 -1 Mod and W93 development. The limitations of the existing facilities, together with the current trends in industry tools and products result in residual risks that cannot be fully mitigated through the Extended Life Program . DOE/NNSA is explorin g potential solutions to address these risks, working with appropriate institutions to conduct materials research, and collaborating with selected manufacturers to conduct technology evaluation to address sustain ing the capability to 2040 and beyond. 3.3.6 Challenges and Strategies Table 3-3 provides a high -level summary of the Weapon Design and Integration area challenges and the strategies to address them. Table 3-3. Summary of the Weapon Design and Integration area challenges and strategies Challenges Strategies Current Strategy Being Implemented Future Strategies Needed Developing and exercising design (rather than assessment) skills in physics, engineering, chemistry, and materials science personnel. Implement activities such as Certification Readiness Exercises, design practicums, and other design studies. Enhance design experience through design studies and Stockpile Responsiveness exercises, and warhead modernization. Developing and exercising certification methodologies usin g recently developed physics performance metrics on device designs for which there is no underground nuclear explosive test data. Develop metrics and apply methodologies to implement. Perform subcritical and HED experiments from which metrics can be extracted or validated. Develop and maintain new and existing facilities and capabilities that underwrite qualification and certification. Managing uncertainty related to DOE/NNSA's design capability for reuse if new component production is unable to meet warhead modernization requirements. Enhancing ability to simulate the effects of aging and manufacturing changes. Rely on current simulation capabilities (validated by abo veground experiments and non -nuclear testing) to model reuse design options. Develop certification methodologies for reuse and replacement designs. Close the capability gap regarding plutonium response evaluation in integrated weapons experiments as part of the Enhanced Capabilities for Subcritical Experiments program. Applying machine learning to weapon physics design problems for current system confidence, future system certification, and increased responsiveness. Develop capabilities to shorten the design loop through workflow enhancement and surrogate model development for faster parameter space exploration. Use machine learning as an accelerant capability for data interpretation, simulation results implementation, certification, design, evaluating discrepancies, detecting anomalies, and enhancing current solutions. HED = high energy density Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-24 3.4 Weapon Material Processing and Manufacturing Area The Weapon Material Processing and Manufacturing Area covers the packaging, processing, handling, and manufacturing of plutonium, uranium, tritium, energetic and hazardous materials, lithium, and other metal and organic materials needed for nuclear weapons. The current stockpile maintenance and modernization programs will continue to demand special nuclear material ( SNM ), HE, and other energetic materials into the distant future. The nuclear security enterprise must maintain reliable production , science, technology, and engineering capabilities , integrated i nfrastructure , and logistics (handling, storage, delivery, and supply chain management) for raw materials and War Reserve ( WR) products. Components that contain SNM or energetic materials require a special conduct of operations, physical security protection, facilities, and proper equipment to handle, package, process, manufacture, and inspect these components. SNM -based produ cts must be handle d, package d, process ed, manufacture d, and inspect ed and these capabilities require many specialized facilities and programs ' support throughout the nuclear security enterprise. The obsolescence, age, or severely degraded nature of many o f the facilities required to produce and process SNM presents operational risks to reliably produce nuclear weapon components. The strategies detailed throughout this section for the overall capability are organized by individual materials and supporting programs. Any necessary bridging strategy or solution currently being implemented as capability investments for each type of component is addressed and major programmatic infrastructure projects. Concurrent to the development of robust strategies for ma terial supply, several collaborative efforts are taking place between production and design agencies to ensure compatibility between design and production capabilities, including material quality and throughput. These include production enclaves such as t he polymer enclave commissioned at LLNL's site 200 in cooperation with the Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC ), or the proposed energetics enclave at Site 300 in collaboration with P antex Plant (Pantex) . 3.4.1 Plutonium Management Maintaining confidence in the nuclear warheads that compose the U.S. nuclear deterrent requires DOE/NNSA to reestablish a plutonium pit manufacturing capability. Newly manufactured pits are required to enable improved warhead safety and security, mitigate against perceived risk to the nuclear deterrent posed by plutonium aging, and support potential changes to future warheads due to threats posed to the U.S. nuclear deterrent from renewed peer competition . Working closely with DoD, a requirement to manufa cture no fewer than 80 WR pits per year (ppy) was established. This number is driven by the stockpile's size, the desire to minimize the number of existing pits past the age of approximately 80 years, and the need to have a flexible manufacturing capabili ty with the capacity to produce a variety of pits to meet current and planned military stockpile requirements. DOE/NNSA is implementing a two -site solution with the objective of producing 30 WR ppy at LANL using the existing Plutonium Facility (PF-4) and 50 WR ppy at the Savannah River Site (SRS) by repurposing the existing facility previously referred to as the Mi xed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) to meet this manufacturing capacity . Both facilities meet the stringent building design standards necessary to support pit manufacturing. This two -site solution restores a critical production capability central to maintaining the Nation's nuclear deterrent. Operating two geographically separated plutonium pit production facilities provides resilience Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-25 and adaptable options to mitigate shutdowns, incidents, or other factors that may affect operations at a single site. Plutonium processing and component manufacturing capabilities are also used for radioisotope thermoelectric generator production ,4 pit surveillance, plutonium science and aging studies, subcritical experiments, National Aeronautics and Space Admin istration space exploration, materials recycle and recovery, and nonproliferation programs. 3.4.1.1 Status Based on progress in operations and the maturation of line -item capital asset acquisition projects that support the two -site solution for pit production, NNS A's current assessment of pit production milestone status follows: DOE/NNSA is on a path to make at least 30 ppy at LANL and 50 ppy at the Savannah River Plutonium Processing Facility (SRPPF ). DOE/NNSA continues to assess risks to implementing its plutonium pit production plan and is implementing mitigation options while studying additional trade space to recover schedule. The SRS assessment is based on the ability to meet three key requirements to produce WR pits at rate: (1) completion of line -item construction and Critical Decision (CD)-4, Approve Start of Operations ; (2) demonstrat e a WR -quality pit manufacturing capability ; and (3) demonstrate the ability to manufacture at full -rate capacity while maintaining WR quality control. The total time duration for achieving steps two and three is several years , based on experience. Because PF -4 is already conducting plutonium operations at LANL, these three key efforts, to a large extent, are being overlapped in time. Since the SRPPF must undergo commissioning to startup plutonium operations, the three key pit requirements to achiev e 50 WR ppy will occur sequentially. In addition to dedicated infrastructure efforts at LANL and SRS, DOE/NNSA is recapitalizing other existing facilities through a series of reinvestment projects, including several line -item projects, to replace the curre nt aging capability to provide supporting functions and processing infrastructure for pit production qualification processes, risk -reduction, and increased reliability activities. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement project maintains continu ity in analytical chemistry and material characterization capabilities by transitioning these activities from the nearly 70 -year -old Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility to newer facilities. The Material Recycle and Recovery program is conducting ri sk reduction activities by removing the nuclear material inventory currently housed in the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility. 4 Radioisotope thermoelectric generators - A type of lightweight, reliable nuclear battery with no moving parts that uses an array of thermocoup les to convert the heat released by the decay of plutonium -238 into electricity. A vacuum induction furnace safely melts, and casts, plutonium metal, a part of the pit production process at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-26 3.4.1.1.1 Approach at Los Alamos National Laboratory for 30 War Reserve Pits Per Year DOE/NNSA will establish a reliable capabili ty at LANL to deliver 30 WR ppy. There are several key steps to delivering 30 WR ppy: Advance the science and mature the engineering to meet the LLNL design agency specifications in support of delivering a first production unit . Maintain and update PF -4 to ensure reliability and continued compliance with all relevant safety requirements . Reconfigure PF -4 for efficient pit production by completing the ongoing equipment installations and facility modification to optimize the pit production process flow and e stablish the capacity for a reliable 30 WR ppy production rate . Increase the workforce required for the pit production mission to manufacture pits ; maintain and operate facilities ; provide security for pit production activities and materials ; and provide a broad range of support functions . Provide acceptable components and support for the experiments and evaluations specified by the LLNL in the Pit Certification Plan Under the guidance of the Pit Production Realization Team. Plutonium metal purification, ca sting, machining, and assembly are all currently performed at LANL's PF -4, while the Radiological Laboratory/Utility/Office Building houses plutonium chemistry operations that support plutonium component production, surveillance, and science missions. DOE /NNSA will transition PF-4 to be available 24/7 for scheduling programmatic work, facility maintenance, equipment installation, and construction activities to accommodate increased operations . DOE/NNSA also will use a waste management program at LANL to m aintain efficient and continuous off -site shipments to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. 3.4.1.1.2 Savannah River Site Approach to Producing a Minimum of 50 War Reserve Pits Per Year DOE/NNSA will reach 50 WR ppy production as close to 2030 as possible by repurposing the former MFFF as SRPPF. SRPPF will be a Security Category 1/Hazard Category 2 structure that provides an opportunity to achieve pit production in a facility designed to meet stringent security and safety requirements for plutonium operations. Initia l modernization activities include repurposing and transitioning the MFFF into a safe, secure, compliant, and efficient pit production facility, the planned SRPPF. Develop ing new facilities and security infrastructure and establish ing a new program office at SRS to sustain an enduring pit production goal of 50 plutonium ppy are also underway. Preliminary and final design efforts for the SRPPF project are in progress with know ledge gained from LANL, LLNL, and other sites. There are several key steps to completing the SRPPF project and establishing an enduring production mission: Complete five interrelated construction subprojects . Hire and train the workforce necessary to establish and sustain the SRS pit production missio n. Begin production operations upon CD -4 to enable delivery of a first production unit pit . Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-27 Establish the institutional systems at SRS necessary to build WR pits . Establish and manage SRS pit production interfaces across the nuclear security enterprise . Re-establish a secure supply chain to support the SRS pit production mission . Further design activities conducted support ing CD-2, Approve Performance Baseline , will identify multiple opportunities to accelerate achieving the required production capacity. One opportunity already down -selected is the use of a High Fidelity Training and Operations Center , which will reduce the time required from CD -4 to delivery of first production unit pit by facilitating operator training and qualification and supporting certification activities in cold environment s. Establishing required SRPPF pit production capacity as close as possible to 2030 remains a high priority and is required for sustaining the Nation's nuclear deterrent 's effectiveness . The proposed pit production mission will need a skilled workforce at the site. Estimates indicate design and construction activities will require approximately 3,000 staff. Sustained production of 50 WR ppy at SRS will require nearly 2,000 production and support staf f. These estimates will continue to be refined as the project's design matures. LANL is actively supporting a knowledge transfer program for the SRS pit production mission with subject matter expertise. DOE/NNSA will undertake a multi -year training and qualification process to ensure the necessary people, processes, procedures, and commodities are in place to meet the minimum 50 ppy requirement at SRS. Essential to this process will be transitioning an existing facility into the SRS High Fidelity Train ing and Operations Center expected to be completed prior to the SRPPF main process building . The Center will enable unclassified and classified training in a non-nuclear environment, aimed to qualify the personnel and procedures ultimately used to build and handle pits in the SRP PF main process building . The Center will also advance final design by serving as a proving ground for selected engineering equipment and a test bed to demonstrate systems integration. LANL and LLNL are supporting the trai ning rotation pipeline for the SRS pit production mission through a knowledge transfer program initiated in FY 2020 with Savannah River National Laboratory. This knowledge transfer program will form the foundation of the High Fidelity Training and Operati ons Center knowledge and experience base. 3.4.1.1.3 Status of Other Plutonium Activities Many other production, surveillance, and research activities involving plutonium must be conducted throughout the nuclear security enterprise , including radioisotope thermoelect ric generator production and surveillance, subcritical plutonium experiments, pit certification, environmental testing, and material processing. Conduct ing these activities requires close coordination between the sites to execute the disassembly activitie s, evaluations, experiments, analysis, and recovery. A responsive plutonium infrastructure requires proper storage facilities, safe and secure disposal pathways, and unique equipment and facilities for R&D activities. 3.4.1.2 Challenges and Strategies Table 3-4 provides a high -level summary of plutonium handling, packaging, and processing challenges and the strategies to address them. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-28 Table 3-4. Summary of plutonium handling, packaging, and processing challenges and strategies Challenges Strategies Current Strategy Being Implemented Future Strategies Needed Timely integration of infrastructure and workforce investments in alignment with W87 -1 program needs to reestablish required pit production capabilities and capacity. Continue to invest in LANL plutonium facilities and workforce needs to meet pit production milestones - achieving the first production unit milestone, then completing the Los Alamos Plutonium Pit Production Project to increase production capacity to 30 WR ppy. Drive continued improv ement in executi ng equipment installation projects and workforce investments to support future pit production needs. Repurpos ing the former MFFF at SRS to achieve a production rate of 50 WR ppy. Implement a tailored approach for the SRPPF project to achieve CD -2/3, and execute engineering, procurement, and construction activities through multiple subprojects to support producing 50 WR ppy. Use knowledge transfer from LANL and LLNL SMEs to support workforce development at SRS to achieve pit production mission objectives. Reestablish the supply chain for weapons -related components and commodities needed to support the 50 WR ppy mission. Execut ing environmental testing/surety/qualification of plutonium pits without nuclear explosive testing. Use and expa nd thermal and mechanical testing capabilities to evaluate newly manufactured and legacy pits in the STS sequence normal environments. Establish equipment, experimental platforms, and systems to evaluate additional normal and abnormal environments that pit s could experience. Leverage the ongoing investment in the Enhanced Capabilities for Subcritical Experiments Program to demonstrate the certification uncertainty achieved with one -point and multi -point safety.

Uranium has a variety of defense and other applications, including weapon components and fuel for naval reactors, commercial power reactors ( for tritium production), and commercial and research reactors (medical isotope production). 3.4.2.1 Highly Enriched Uranium HEU is needed to support stockpile programs, Naval Reactors , and Nonproli feration programs. Uranium Modernization supports these efforts through modernizing the infrastructure around HEU processing, purification, machining, and other operations. Particularly, the program is working to phase out mission dependency on Building 9212 at the Y -12 National Security Complex (Y -12). The program is working toward completing the following actions to ensure the success of this transition: Relocat ing HEU capabilities from Building 9212 into the Uranium Processing Facility and other endur ing facilities . Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-29 Leverag ing these relocations to develop and deploy new technologies that will improve safety, reduce costs, and enhance throughput to meet future needs . Invest ing in key systems such as casting, machining, metal purification systems, assembly, and analytical chemist ry capabilities to ensure long -term reliability . 3.4.2.2 Status DOE/NNSA manages and operates the Nation's primary uranium processing and storage capabilities at Y-12, and several laboratories for R&D capabilities at Y -12 and other locations across the nuclear sec urity enterprise. Building 9212 at Y -12 houses the most hazardous of the HEU processing capabilities ; however , at more than 75 years old, the facility is deteriorating and does not meet modern nuclear safety and security standards. DOE/NNSA is decreasing mission dependency on this facility by relocating certain uranium purification and processing capabilities to existing facilities at Y -12, and through construction of the Uranium Processing Facility. In addition to relocating these capabilities, DOE/NNSA is moderniz ing them to increase safety and efficiency, ensuring future material needs can be met. The Uranium Processing Facility will replace Building 9212 capabilities for HEU casting, special oxide production, chemical recovery, decontamination, and a ssay. HEU casting and special oxide production will be housed in the Uranium Processing Facility's Main Process Building, while chemical recovery, decontamination, and assay will take place in the Uranium Processing Facility's Salvage and Accountability Building. A third building, the Uranium Processing Facility's Mechanical/Electrical Equipment Building, will provide utilities and other support systems. While the Uranium Processing Facility is constructed and undergoes startup activities, DOE/NNSA will relocate capabilities for HEU purification and chip processing, deploying new technologies that will fully enable phasing out mission dependency on Building 9212 and meet future mission needs. Ongoing projects include electrorefining, calciner, and direc t chip melt (recovery of enriched uranium machine tool chips and turnings by collecting and melting them in a furnace) , which will reduce cost and improve manufacturing processes for nuclear weapon materials. These capabilities will replace the hazardous HEU processing capabilities, improv e safety, and reduc e risk. Technology maturation, such as for electrorefining and direct electrolytic reduction, is funded and monitored by the Uranium Modernization Program. When the technology is sufficiently mature, the equipment develop ment and deploy ment is pursued through capital line -item acquisition and major item of equipment processes, as appropriate. This process has generated three current major items of equipment acquisitions to enable the following processes: Electrorefining is the electrochemical purification process for HEU metal. This capability, located in Building 9215, along with the calciner process in Building 9212 (see below), will replace the current high -hazard wet chemistry pr ocess located in Building 9212. The calciner process uses a dry thermal treatment process to convert low -equity HEU liquids to a dry stable form for storage. This capability will process material remaining in Building 9212, ensuring all material is recove red, aiding in shutdown activities. This process, along with the electrorefining capability in Building 9215 (see above), will enable the shutdown of the current high -hazard wet chemistry process in Building 9212. Direct Chip Melt is the process by which HEU machine tool chips/turnings are recovered and melted in furnaces. This capability, located in Building 9215, will replace the current high -hazard practices where chips are transferr ed to Building 9212, then clean ed, briquett ed, and stor ed there. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-30 DOE/ NNSA will perform its enriched uranium metal purification in Building 9215 using the electrorefining process, which will achieve CD -4 in 2023. Uranium Modernization will continue to fund the hazardous wet chemistry metal purification process in Building 9 212 until the electrorefining process is fully operational, at which point wet chemistry in Building 9212 will be shut down. Uranium Modernization currently uses Y-12's Building 9212 resources to supply the stockpile with purified HEU metal. The program provides a comprehensive storage capability to support a steady material supply stream through peak production periods. It also enables HEU material de -inventory activities to increase safety, establish target working inventory levels for the production facilities, and optimize inventory composition . The program, partnering with DOE/NNSA's Office of Infrastructure, is sustaining existing and enduring uranium facilities with an Extended Life Program. These efforts allow safe and secure operations to cont inue , including those relocated from Building 9212, in existing facilities through 2040 and beyond . Uranium Modernization is proactively removing equipment that is no longer needed from these enduring facilities through its Flexible Production Capacity Initiative to improve Y -12's responsiveness and resiliency. 3.4.2.3 Challenges and Strategies Table 3-5 provi des a high -level summary of highly enriched uranium handling, packaging, and processing challenges and the strategies to address them. Table 3-5. Summary of highly enriched uranium handling, packaging, and processing challenges and strategies Challenges Strategies Current Strategy Being Implemented Future Strategies Needed Bringing new processes online and shutting down hazardous processes. Verify equipment meets all requirements and use Operational Release Plans to streamline the transition to operations. Support past project closure, ensuring the transition to production is successful . Developing processes to bridge capability gaps as Building 9212 is phased out. Closely monitor and work with the site to advance technology development and plan how to move projects forward. Closely monitor project schedules and prepare fallback options to ensure mission demand is met. Prepar ing Building 9212 for disposition and demolition. Shutdown high -hazard processes as new processes are brought online and begin material removal, maintaining a 15+ year schedule. Current strategy is sufficient. Continuing operations in aging facilities with increasing safety, security, and environmental requirements and maintaining them until operations transition to newly deployed facilities. Make short - to medium -term recapitalization investments where reasonable. Find adaptive solutions to maintain facilities past their usef ul lives.

DOE/NNSA must have the capability to produce certified components made from high purity depleted uranium metal (HPDU) and DU -niobium alloy (binary) to fulfill mission require ments. DU and binary are required for nuclear component production to maintain and modernize the stockpile through LEPs, Mods , and limited life component (LLC) exchange programs. DU and binary are processed into precision components through complex processes that must meet stringent requirements. Key processes include alloying, casting, rolling, swaging, forming, forging, machining, assembly, welding, and inspection . 3.4.2.3.2 Status The Depl eted Uranium Modernization Program was established in FY 2021 by consolidating the DU portions of the previous Uranium Sustainment Program and other related programs. DU capabilities include feedstock procurement, restarting and maintaining legacy Vacuum Induction Melt -Vacuum Arc Remelt alloying and manufacturing processes, and investing in new key technologies. In the early 2000s, these capabilities lapsed due to materials reuse , low -demand signals, and prioritiz ing other activities. The Depleted Uraniu m Modernization Program is restarting these capabilities to meet imminent mission requirements. DOE/NNSA has a long -term requirement to reestablish a reliable supply of HPDU before the current inventory is exhausted. DOE/NNSA is working toward an AoA study to determine the best approach to meet the mission need for HPDU supply. One concept is to de velop a uranium hexafluoride (DUF 6) to uranium tetrafluoride (DUF 4) conversion line and establish a capability to convert DUF 4 to HPDU metal. DOE/NNSA is also evaluating if recycling DoD DU munitions to mitigate schedule risks associated with establishing a DUF 4 conversion line is feasible or not . Figure 3-3. High Purity Depleted Uranium supply chain DOE/NNSA is developing new technologies to replace and augment aging capabilities and to provide a more efficient and cost -effective means of producing bi nary components, allowing DOE/NNSA to meet future production demands while reducing feedstock demand. For example, Direct Casting is a technology being developed to supplement current wrought activities that would significantly reduce equipment failure risk, decrease material waste, and improve process efficiency. The Depleted Uranium Modernization Program is also pursuing new technologies for material reuse and recycling, such as electron beam cold hearth melting of binary. These new technologies have t he potential to significantly reduce risks to production and DU and binary components material feedstock in the future stockpile.

Depleted Uranium Moder nization Process flow chart DOE/NNSA's Manhattan Project -era facilities continue to experience age -related failures that present significant risk to mission delivery and personnel safety. Short -term stockpile demands require dedicated resources to restart and modernize legacy -DU processing capabilities. Ultimately, to meet long -term stockpile demands, DOE/NNSA will invest in a new dedicated DU facility. 3.4.2.3.3 Challenges and Strategies Table 3-6 provides a high -level summary of depleted uranium modernization challenges and the strategies to address them. Table 3-6. Summary of depleted uranium moderniza tion challenges and strategies Challenges Strategies Current Strategy Being Implemented Future Strategies Needed HPDU inventory insufficient to meet long -term demands. Purchase existing, limited HPDU supplies from commercial vendors. Scaling up DU munitions recycling to convert to HPDU. Conduct AoA study to inform alternatives for creating DUF 4 feedstock. Invest in EBCHM and direct casting to reduce overall HPDU demand. DU alloying capabilities have lapsed and need to be restarted and modernized to support future stockpile needs. Invest in the restart and maintenance of the legacy alloying processes. Purchase additional equipment to reduce the strain on legacy equipment a nd processes. Coordinate across production and design agencies to expedite binary qualification. Use the NNSA Binary Working Group to manage existing and future binary supplies and set NNSA priorities. Deploy EBCH M alloying production technologies to improve efficiency and recycling capabilities. Integrate direct cast technology into production to reduce binary material demands and waste due to increased efficiencies and decrease process risk. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-33 Challenges Strategies Current Strategy Being Implemented Future Strategies Needed Current component man ufacturing capabilities rely on aging equipment and have limited capacity to meet future stockpile needs. Identify bottlenecks and develop bridging strategies to fulfill near -term mission requirements should new technology not be employed in the immediate future. Purchase wrought critical spare parts to sustain the process. Invest in direct casting technology to produce component technologies more efficiently and reliably. Current DU facilities experience age - related failures and have insufficient floor space to support future stockpile demand. Identify opportunities to meet capacity within existing space using process improvements, upgraded equipment, and future needs and capacity modeling . Invest to recapitalize the aging physical infrastructure, thus reducing risk to produce strategic materials and components. Establish a combination of on -site and off - site storage capabilities to store required HPDU feedstock quantities to meet fu ture mission demand. Evaluate long -term DU facility options to meet future stockpile demands. Sustain existing DU facilities with a DU/binary strategy to ensure safe and secure operations in existing facilities through 2040 or until a replacement facility is constructed . Continuing operations in aging facilities with increasing safety, security, and environmental requirements and maintaining them until operations transition to newly deployed facilities. Make short -term to medium -term recapitalization investments where reasonable. Find adaptive solutions to maintain facilities past their useful lives.

DOE/NNSA requires enriched uranium at varied enrichment levels for tritium production, nonproliferation, and the Naval Reactors Program. The Domestic Uranium Enrichment Program is responsible for ensuring a reliable supply of enriched uranium is available to support U.S. national security needs. Since the 2013 closure of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, near Paducah, Kentucky, the Unit ed States has lacked the capability to produce enriched uranium free of peaceful use obligations (i.e., unobligated). While commercial LEU sources exist, they carry peaceful use obligations and are therefore unusable for defense missions. Mission needs f or enriched uranium are currently fulfilled via the United States' existing HEU inventory (including downblending HEU to produce LEU where needed), which is a finite and currently irreplaceable source. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-34 3.4.2.4.1 Status The Domestic Uranium Enrichment Program is impl ementing a three -pronged strategy to supply current enriched uranium needs and reestablish a domestic uranium enrichment capability for long -term enriched uranium needs: Downblend HEU to LEU to extend the tritium fuel need date to 2044 . DOE/NNSA has ident ified existing unobligated and unencumbered material to power the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) reactors through 2044. Much of the material is HEU \"scrap,\" which is unattractive for use by other programs. This effort maintains continuous vendor downbl ending operations , which would otherwise close in the absence of feed material. However, because the HEU inventory is finite , and at present, irreplaceable, downblending is a temporary solution. Develop enrichment technology options. Following an analysi s of available enrichment technologies, DOE/NNSA determined that centrifuge technologies have the highest technical maturity and lowest risk. DOE/NNSA is funding centrifuge R&D efforts at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to ensure a centrifuge technology is available in time to be deployed in a domestic uranium enrichment capability. Execute the acquisition process to deploy an enrichment technology. Because the HEU inventory has a finite nature , the United States will eventually need a new uranium enrichmen t capability. DOE/NNSA approved CD -0 for this capability in December 2016 and expects to make a final technology down -select and deployment decision in the mid -2020s. 3.4.2.4.2 Challenges and Strategies Table 3-7 provides a high -level summary of domestic uranium enrichment challenges and the strategies to address them. Table 3-7. Summary of domestic uranium enrichment challenges and strategies Challenges Strategies Current Strategy Being Implemented Future Strategies Needed Enrichment technologies are complex and difficult to develop and deploy. DOE/NNSA has invested in two centrifuge technologies to provide optionality and contingency. DOE/NNSA continuously assesses its inventory to identify unobligated enriched uranium that may provide additional development time or margin to the LEU need date. Continue developing centrifuge technologies to reduce long -term deployment risks. Sources of unobligated LEU are finite and limited. DOE/NNSA continuously assesses its inventory to identify any additional unobligated enriched uranium. Establish a reliable source of unobligated enriched uranium. LEU = low -enriched uranium Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-35 3.4.3 Lithium Management 3.4.3.1 Lithium Lithium handling, packaging, and processing is a capability that is key to the nuclear weapon production mission. It continues to have increased focus due to supply, production, and infrastructure issues. DOE/NNSA requires specialized, weapon -specific forms of lithium for stockpile sustainment and is the sole source provider for these materials. DOE/NNSA manufactures lithium materials into precis e nuclear weapon components that meet stringent specifications to support warhead modernization programs and joint test assembly requirements, and to support tritiu m-producing burnable absorber rod (TPBAR) production for the tritium production, handling , and processing program. 3.4.3.2 Status Lithium for the weapons program is currently provided via a recycling process that relies on dismantled weapon feedstock to supply material for processing. Nondestructive and destructive testing is performed for lithium components in full assembly and part forms as part of surveillance data collection for ensuring confidence in the stockpile. Additional material is provided to the Department of Homeland Security and DOE Office of Science for various needs, and to other customers through the Strategic Partnership Program process. DOE/NNSA is actively pursuing alternate, advanced lithium purification techniques. Technology Readiness Assessments are conducted as needed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of identified technologies. Currently, agin g infrastructure and antiquated equipment present risks to mission delivery that, if realized , will affect the ability to meet stockpile requirements. The 79 -year -old facility where lithium is processed has structural issues due to chemical degradation , which pose s safety and environmental concerns , and a replacement facility is needed . DOE/NNSA continues to execute and revise a lithium strategy to maintain sufficient lithium processing capabilities (from raw materials to finished assemblies) to meet near -term and long -term requirements . The strategy includes the design and construction of a new Lithium Processing Facility by 2031 to house modernized lithium processing capabilities. The Lithium Processing Facility F has received CD -1, Approve Alterna tive Selection and Cost Range , approval and is on track for CD-2/3 approval first quarter of FY 202 6. DOE/NNSA will continue to work with stakeholders to develop tailored, long -term staffing plans that anticipate critical skills shortfalls within this capa bility and properly forecast staffing levels based on the current program of record. Subject matter expert ( SME ) growth and sustainment will require SMEs undergo continued training and development to produce lithium components and resolve technical issues associated with these complex production processes. 3.4.3.3 Challenges and Strategies Table 3-8 provides a high -level summary of lithium handling, packaging, and process ing challenges and the strategies to address them.

Design and construct the Lithium Processing Fa cility. Continue to maintain legacy processing effort s through the identified facility life cycle extension project until the Lithium Processing Facility is fully qualified. Sustaining the supply of recycled lithium during potential shortages. Restart a small -scale purification capability and legacy processing capabilities in the legacy lithium facility to provide additional feedstock material. Deploy/recapitalize new equipment (production cleaning station glovebox, backup pressure vessel, backup crusher/grinder) to increase capacity and provide redundancy to reduce likelihood of single -point failures. Monitor and optimize weapons dismantlement schedule to provide feedstock as needed.

Due to the rate of radioactive decay, tritium must be replenished periodically in these components. DOE/NNSA produc es tritium for this purpose and other s using TPBARs that are irradiated in the Watts Bar Unit 1 and Watts Bar Unit 2 nuclear reactors (WBN 1 and WBN 2) operated by TVA. Because this is defense -purposed tritium, WBN 1 and WBN 2 require unencumbered and unobligated LEU use as fuel (i.e., LEU that is free of any peaceful use restrictions). Once the TPBARs are irradiated, the bars are transported to SRS, where the tritium is extracted, stored, and loaded into GTS reservoirs. In addition to tritium production at TVA, tritium supplies from previously filled reservoirs are recycled to maintain required inventories. Most of DOE/NNSA's tritium capability activities focus on stockpile requirements, but activities also include tritium gas processing R&D, GTS life s torage, helium -3 recovery, and stockpile surveillance. 3.4.4.1 Status DOE/NNSA has a multi -year plan of producing and recycling tritium to meet national security requirements and demonstrating a highly reliable supply chain. DOE/NNSA continues to deliver the requisite supply by using TVA's WBN 1 and WBN 2 reactors. The goal to reach maximum tritium production in each of the two Watts Bar reactors by FY 2025 is on schedule. Extraction of tritium from irradiated TPBARs at SRS is ongoing in accordance with the multi -year plan . DOE/NNSA manages numerous facilities at SRS that support tritium handling, processing, and storage functions, including recovery, nondestructive analysis, and surveillance, and is implementing a plan to replace , or recapitalize , aging facilities. This plan focuses on facilities maintenance and the need for supply chain management (e.g., vendors, tritium R&D capabilities, etc.). The Tritium Finishing Facility line -item project, along with several minor construction projects and equipment replacement/upgrade projects, will replace the critical capabilities occurring at the existing 60 -year -old manufacturing building that operates 24/7 for GTS production and surveillance. Examples of these required smaller projects include: Replacing large, obsolete distributed control systems for the gas processing equipment Replacing and el ectronic refurbishing mass spectrometers to analyze gas associated with processing equipment Installing a hydrogen/tritium separation capability in the Tritium Extraction Facility Replacing the deuterium/tritium separation equipment, including support syst ems and valves Several minor construction projects to address end of life, safety , and space requirements The SRS Tritium Extraction Facility performs a cask receip t, enabling TPBARs to be moved safely from shipping casks to basket . Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-38 Some of the scope described above will require significant processing downtime, particularly replac ing the deuterium/tritium separation equipment. Maintaining t he equipment replacement sequence and timing will be critical to minimize downtime . 3.4.4.2 Challenges and Strategies Table 3-9 provides a high -level summary of the tritium production, handling, and processing challenges and the strategies to address them. Table 3-9. Summary of the tritium production, handling, and processing challenges and strategies Challenges Strategies Current Strategy Being Implemented Future Strategies Needed Maintaining a reliable tritium supply chain to meet tritium inventory and availability requirements to load GTSs on schedule. Assess supply chain risks and opportunities. Investments are being made that will provide high -level reliability, flexibility, and resiliency to the program. Continue to monitor risks and opportunities to identify cost -effective solutions and retain high reliability. Planning for alternative tritium production technologies or methods due to the uncertainties associated with Nuclear R egulatory Commission approval of operating license renewal applications in 2055 for Watts Bar Units 1 and 2. Invest in studies that identify and monitor viable and emerging replacement methods and technologies as risk mitigation for long -term tritium production. Monitor evolving technologies and invest in existing or new technologies as appropriate. Maintaining facilities and equipment to support stockpile deliverables and future Alts, Mods, and LEPs, and reduce GTS delivery risks. Construct the modern Tritium Finishing Facility on schedule to replace infrastructure critical to stockpile deliverables at SRS by 2031. Continue long -lead procurements and other activities needed to support replacement of aged tritium isotopic equipment and suppor t systems in CY 2025 . Monitor emerging needs and implement strategies and actions to mitigate risks. Developing technologies that further enhance stockpile maintenance and evaluation and increase efficiency of processes throughout the tritium production l ife cycle. Invest in fundamental tritium science , includ ing material property interactions and scientific research into the material properties and behaviors of TPBARs, GTSs, and tritium gas processing technologies. Develop a strategy to acquire dedicated radiological tritium capabilities to address future technology needs without compromising mission schedule. Planning for long lead times to hire, clear, and train personnel. Examine multiyear staffing needs appropriate to ensure a continuous knowledge, skills, and abilities influx to sustain capabilities. Implement additional strategies to maximize knowledge retention and minimize workforce turnover.

Energetics are materials that provide instantaneous energy through an exo thermic chemical reaction. Energetics include specific end products, such as HE that include conventional HE and insensitive HE, low explosives (e.g., pyrotechnics and propellants), their respective energetic ingredients, and various inert ingredients req uired for manufacturing (e.g., polymers, reactants, catalysts, plasticizers, oxidizers, fuels, Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-39 ballistic modifiers, stabilizers, surfactants, and bonding agents). Across the enterprise, DOE/NNSA laboratories and production sites handle energetic material as part of the nuclear weapon sustainment and warhead modernization missions. The current stockpile maintenance and modernization programs will continue to demand energetic and hazardous materials. Ensuring DOE/NNSA has the capability to properly handle , package, process, and manufacture energetic and hazardous materials is essential to supporting the nuclear deterrent. This capability depends on the ability to perform HE and energetic scientific and engineering activities, and is united with the ability to handle, package, and process SNM (plutonium and uranium) (Section 3.4.1 and 3.4.2). The nuclear security enterprise must ma intain reliable production; science, technology, and engineering capabilities; an integrated infrastructure; a robust domestic supplier base; and logistics (handling, storage, and delivery) for raw materials and WR products. Most of the current facilities were built over 70 years ago, lack the electrical infrastructure to meet mission requirements, and have safety and security limitations because infrastructure is failing . New facilities construction and existing energetic facilities recapitalization across the nuclear security enterprise are needed to improve the capability and capacity required by increased modernization efforts, continuing challenges associated with a limited vendor base, and advancements to energetic manufacturing. HE processing, p roduction, and manufacturing are currently performed externally by a vendor and internally at the Pantex . This capability encompasses the ability to supply raw material, procure HE from the vendor, and perform safe HE processing into precision parts meeti ng tight specifications. The current stockpile planned warhead modernization programs, LLC exchanges, and future modernization programs will continue to demand HE and energetic materials. In each weapon, DOE/NNSA uses either one of the two types of HE p roduced in the main charge of a nuclear weapon: (1) insensitive HE, which provides greater safety and security of the stockpile by reducing the risk of lowlikelihood but highconsequence accidents from initial build through retirement and disassembly, and /or (2) conventional HE, which provides enhanced performance for a lower volume and weight. The type of HE u sed changes depending on the weapon type and purpose. 3.4.5.1 Status The facilities and equipment that support this capability pose mission risks due to t heir aging and declining condition and must be maintained through rigorous corrective maintenance, preventive maintenance, and calibrations. Experienced and knowledgeable personnel are needed to proper ly care and handl e energetic and hazardous materials. Also, r ecruitment of skilled professionals and extensive safety training are imperative for safe operations. With an increased workload and the attrition/retirement of senior personnel, DOE/NNSA must focus on building and training a workforce that can s afely perform these operations well into the future. DOE/NNSA completed the Nuclear Explosive Package Engineering Test's functional test phase in January 2022. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-40 DOE/NNSA is currently planning three major programmatic line -item construction projects for HE. The High Explosives Science and Engineering Facility will consolidate 15 aging facilities into 3 new and more efficient facilities to conduct science, technology, engineering, and production activities in weapons assembly/disassembly and HE. The High Explosives Science and Engineering Facility received CD -2/3 approval in the third quarter of FY 2022 and commenced construction immediately. CD-4 is planned for FY 2027 . The HE Synthesis, Formulation, and Production project will address challenges at the supplier's production facility and address the difficult ies in meeting DOE/NNSA production requirements. It plans to receive CD -3A approval for the first quarter of FY 2024 and CD -4 approval fourth quarter of FY 20 30. Areas that will be addressed include explosive and mock formulation operations to support multiple weapon programs, technology development f or future programs, and support for strategic partners. Finally, the Energetic Materials Characterization project will provide the capability to perform energetics material characterization, analysis, and testing, and will replace obsolete facilities that pose risks to workforce safety. Future infrastructure enhancements may include consolidati ng and moderniz ing existing facilities critical to meet the stockpile's HE production capabilities for energetic components (main charges, boosters, actuators, ignit ers, rocket motors, timers, and detonators) in a modern and enhanced safety and security environment. DOE/NNSA also will continue to implement minor construction to mitigate known issues with the limited commercial component vendor base to provide on -site production of energetic components in the stockpile (actuators, igniters, detonators, timers, rocket motors). 3.4.5.2 Challenges and Strategies Table 3-10 provides a high -level summary of the high explosives and energetics management challenges and the strategies to address them. Table 3-10. Summary of the high explosives and energetics management challenges and strategies Challenges Strategies Current Strategy Being Implemented Future Strategies Needed Nuclear security enterprise infrastructure for energetics face aging critical facilities and equipment (many past their life expectancies), increasing demands for capability and capacity, and uncertainty in material production due to a single - source vender base. Coordinate with the Infrastructure and Operations Program and the Programmatic Recapitalization Working Group to improve energetic readiness. Keep aging equipment available for warhead modernization and current stockpile systems through rigorous maintena nce programs and integrated equipment refinancing planning across the nuclear security enterprise . Find creative solutions to maintain facilities past their useful life. Make short -term to medium -term refinancing investments where reasonable. Engage and e nable sites to reduce dependency or better enable external suppliers. Construct the HE Synthesis, Formulation, and Production building, the H ESE Facility, and the Energetic Materials Characterization facility . Identify and invest in equipment requirements through input from the sites and link them to defined risks and capability gaps. Employ creative methods to mitigate obsolescence issues, such as using additive manufacturing to produce parts. Stand up production enclaves at design laboratorie s to enable more efficient response to the emerging deterrent. Prototyping Capabilities, funded at the production agencie s, would better serve this need by not only addressing emerging needs, but by also providing early visibility and involvement that would accelerate transitions from development into production. See Section 3.5.23.5.4. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-41 Challenges Strategies Current Strategy Being Implemented Future Strategies Needed Dependence on a small and shrinking vendor base to supply the explosives, constituent components, and specialized equipment needed to produce its energetic end products. Establish clear requirements for Nuclear Enterprise Assurance. When necessary, use in -house capabilities to restore missio n schedules at risk.

Analyze an d apply lessons learned from Defense Programs initiatives for energetic materials for broader implementation across the enterprise along lines of effort such as design for manufacturing, and requirements and capacity integration. Ensuring requirements for energetic materials are adequately identified, preserved, and documented. Document the detailed processes necessary for the synthesis and formulation of energetic materials for a repeatable material specification that yields the required engineering and performance requirements through efforts with the NNSA Energetics Coordinating Committee. Document the technical basis for future process parameter choices and rationale for specific requirements in the specifications. Improve understanding and control over material specifications and manufacturing to improve reliability and repeatability and increase lot acceptance. Develop techniques to computationally assess manufacturing with computational fluid dynamics, computational chemistry, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

This production may require organic materials and processi ng production , manufacturing, and metallic and organic products inspection , based on knowledge of material behavior, compatibility, and aging. This would include, but is not limited to, polymer material and part manufacturing. 3.5 Weapon Component Production Area The Weapon Component Production area includes multiple capabilities for producing all the non -nuclear components and the arming, fuzing, and firing system , and for designing, developing, engineering , and integrating other materials, from components to prototype high -quality and full -scale nuclear explosive packages and/or their major assemblies. This area also includes the advanced manufacturing capabilities that apply modern technologies to advance NNSA legacy and existing processes for making and producing weapons components and systems. The capability area involves internal and external manufacturing and maintenance and of a broad supply base for parts . It also includes identif ying and verif ying trusted suppliers to provide materials and parts within the weapon product realization process. 3.5.1 Non -Nuclear Component Modernization and Production The Non -Nuclear Capability Modernization Program manages projects and executes strategies to modernize, monit or, and ensure DOE/NNSA's non -nuclear capabilities and capacities. The Non -Nuclear Capability Modernization Program provides funding to modernize and strengthen capabilities required for full product realization, including design development , qualification , and production of non-nuclear components for multiple weapon systems. Non -nuclear components and subsystems make up more than half the cost of each warhead modernization activity. This program consolidates management and oversight of stra tegic investments in technology, equipment, infrastructure, tools, and materials. Non -Nuclear Capability Modernization activities include: Procuring e quipment Meeting non-nuclear component design, qualification, and manufacturing capacity requirements Increasing non-nuclear component manufacturing in capacity and capability within the nuclear security enterprise and extend ing and strengthen ing the trusted supplier base Sustain ing DOE/NNSA's capability to produce trusted microelectronics Re-establishing critical capabilities for the design, production, and qualification of nuclear weapon electrical and mechanical systems Moderniz ing capabilities with a fragile vendor base such as Power Sources program deliverables Reduc ing component manufact uring costs through introduc ing modernized processes and technologies Develop ing a pre -qualified and trusted commercial parts inventory to avoid delays in integrating commercial off -the-shelf components into DOE/NNSA systems Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-43 Production sites work with the national security laboratories early in the design phase to provide production perspectives on material selections and designs to enhance components producibility . The national security laboratories define the component testing requirements for acceptance through a variety of specialized procedures to ensure materials meet design specifications , parts are manufactured within acceptable tolerances , and assemblies function as intended. 3.5.1.1 Status DOE/NNSA has made progress in developing rapid prototy ping and advanced manufacturing capabilities that have the potential to accelerate production, reduce production issues, and deliver better overall products at lower costs. Production sites are facing capacity shortfalls in production and components deve lopment due to increased weapon modernization requirements and scope. The increased workload has resulted in a growth in the KCNSC management and operating partner 's workforce that has more than doubled since 2014. DOE/NNSA is adding additional productio n capacity through leasing at KCNSC and shifting production to other DOE/NNSA sites while simultaneously increasing the supplier base for commercial component production. Off -site office space has been leased to meet the increased office employment. KCNS C is leasing an additional 275,000 square feet of space for manufacturing to meet the near -term weapon modernization mission. Additional space will be needed for long -term manufacturing requirements. LLNL and KCNSC jointly developed and implemented the P olymer Enclave to help ensure production capacity for the W80 -4 and W87 -1. Further, t he Enclave has enabled advanced Direct Ink Write ( DIW ) technology research and production process development to better integrate and increase cycles of learning for the technology, resulting in more rapid product development for the programs. All modernization programs and future planned nuclear weapon syst ems require power sources, and DOE/ NNSA has concluded there is an unacceptable risk to power source development and production due to failing and inadequate power source facilities and an unreliable supplier base. DOE/ NNSA is investing in the development of new power source technologies across the nuclear security enterprise to expand the option space for safe and reliable long -term power sources that can meet evolving system architectures . Currently, the mission assignment for design and production agencies for power source is assigned to SNL. DOE/NNSA completed an AoA Study in 2020 and identified a preferred alternative for pursuing capital acquisition of a line -item construction project to address this risk . Current stockpile stewardship plans are forecasting sustained high workload for power sources production over the next decade. Similar issues hold true for radiation -hardened microelectronics at SNL's MESA complex; the MESA faciliti es and existing equipment face obsolescence and are becoming less suitable for mission use. MESA has an ongoing extended life program to sustain MESA's capabilities through 2040. In addition, plans are being developed for sourcing and manufacturing these microelectronics well past 2040. Aging equipment poses reliability and obsolescence issues, resulting in greater operations continuity risks . The Capabilities Based Investments program helps mitigate these risks and related ones through projects which refinance high risk failure test, measurement, and production equipment. In addition, DOE/NNSA is pursuing efforts to better understand current and future equipment needs across the nuclear security enterprise for all aspects of the nuclear weapons mission , including non -nuclear production, through the Programmatic Recapitalization Working Group. This working group is a combination of participants from the Office of Defense Programs and the Office of Infrastructure, and has full participation from each of the DOE/NNSA sites. The concern with aging capabilities extends to major environmental test facilities used to qualif y and assess non -nuclear components in their extreme environments to high reliabilities not required for commercial products. The majority of these facilities, including the Annular Core Research Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-44 Reactor, are decades old and , similar to production facilities, have suffered from technology obsolescence and deferred maintenance over the years. These facilitie s must remain operational to assure qualif ying non-nuclear components does not become critical path for the modernization programs. DOE/NNSA is becoming increasingly dependent on internal production due to difficulty finding trusted sources for non -nuclea r weapon components such as power sources, cables, and radiation -hardened microsystems. This insourcing may require additional facilities, equipment, and infrastructure for certain product lines. In the long term, capital reinvestment will be crucial to maintaining DOE/NNSA's manufacturing and testing capabilities suite . Developing additional qualified commercial suppliers will help this effort, although commercial demand for these products, with less stringent production requirements, is posing challeng es throughout the supplier base. 3.5.1.2 Challenges and Strategies Table 3-11 provides a high -level summary of non-nuclear capability modernization challenges and the strategies to address them. Table 3-11. Summary of non-nuclear capability modernization challenges and strategies Challenges Strategies Current Strategy Being Implemented Future Strategies Needed Increased Scope and Complexity: Workload projections to produce non - nuclear components for the program of record exceed existing equipment and infrastructure capacity. Manufacturing space was sized for fewer, less -complex weapon systems. DOE/NNSA will develop options for additional space or more efficient use of existing space. Planning is underway to determine the most prudent so lutions to provide increased production capacity at SNL (for Power Sources) and KCNSC. Additionally, production enclaves enable increased production at production sites. The MESA complex at SNL fulfills an enduring need for radiation -hardened microelectron ics. A Federal Management Plan will implement processes to validate sustainment and modernization needs, identify potential funding gaps, and develop mitigation strategies to ensure MESA capabilities continue to meet stockpile sustainment and modernizatio n needs through 2040. Integration of New Technologies: As new manufacturing techniques are developed, qualified, and accepted, new production capabilities are required to support manufacturing involving different materials, multi -function machines, additive manufacturing, and other new approaches. Space for the new capabilities is required in addition to current equipment until legacy technologies can be retired. The Capability -Based Investments program is providing interim relief for some of the critical equipment needs related to these key product lines. Investments in multiple Advanced Manufacturing technologies are being made across several NNSA sites and are expected to be used by FY 2023. Additionally, production enclaves at design laboratories enable new manufacturing techniques to transition smoothly to production by encouragi ng early DA -PA interactions. The Non -Nuclear Capabilities Program will continue to collaborate with the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Program Office to identify promising technologies that could/would be committed to future modernization programs if sufficiently mature and fund them to higher technology readiness levels and manufacturing readiness levels . 5 These technologies) will enable improvements in stockpile safety, security, use control, and reliability, while minimizing the schedule, performance, and cost risk to the identified modernization program. 5 Technology readiness level (TRL) is a measurement system to assess the maturity level of a particular technology that include s nine levels, where TRL 1 is the lowest (the associated scientific research is beginning) and TRL 9 is the highest (a technology has been proven through successful operation). Manufacturing readiness level (MRL) is a means of communicating the degree to which a component or subsystem is read to be produced. MRLs represent many attributes of a manufacturing system (e.g., people, manufacturing capability, facilities, conduct of operations, and tooling). There are nine MRLs, with the lowest bein g product development and the highest being steady -state production. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-45 Challenges Strategies Current Strategy Being Implemented Future Strategies Needed Material Availability: Some material supplie s are limited to only those quantities remaining from legacy programs yet continue to be in demand by weapons programs. Vendors have lost the capability, capacity, or interest to produce more of these materials. Current efforts for managing these critical materials consist of establishing a central database for at - risk materials and providing a transparen t supply chain network and associated risks by industry experts . Supply chain analysis and studies will examine supplier network risks for non - nuclear components and provide recommended policy actions, production activity practices, and material solutions to improve supply chain resiliency. These efforts also coordinat e across DOE/NNSA to prioritize supplier risks, develop enterprise -wide mitigation strategies, and leverage available policy tools such as the Defense Production Act, and leverage existing partnerships such as with DoD . Vendor Implications: Risks in the available supplier base and the need to produce more classified components is driving a need for additional in -house production capability while continuing to identify and qualify additional suppliers. The program will support non -nuclear component mat erial development and replacement identified for use. The program will then engage in activities to modernize DOE/NNSA's industrial capacity for its implementation. Early engagement with design requirements to research potential new qualified sources. Ba seline capabilities at the design agencies to quickly fulfill unexpected needs. DA-PA = design agency -production agency MESA = Microsystems Engineering, Science and Applications 3.5.2 Weapon Component and Material Process Development The Weapon Component and Material Process Development capability is focused on research, development, engineering, and integrati ng technologies into production operations to improve cycle time, cost, safety, security, reliability, and performance. This capability entails improving required manufacturing, scientific, and engineering capabilities in the production environment, while also meeting DOE/NNSA production requirements . Weapon Component and Material Process Development capabilities must include the ability to rapidly develop and mature manufacturing processes and technologies. Advanced manufacturing technologies and digital -based processes are needed to reduce cost a nd support mission success. Historically, these processes and technologies have been matured late in the process, with limited time to produce viable component and material options to support production. The expanding scope of the weapon modernization pr ograms is driving increased complexity and diversity of production demands, which inherently slows process and technology maturati ng. The Weapon Component and Material Process Development capability develops innovative manufacturing processes, technologie s, and materials that are necessary to address obsolescence due to sunset availability, regulatory safety , or security requirements, and to reduce schedule and cost risks. Weapon Component and Material Process Development Accomplishments In the absence of a suitable commercial solution, a custom software package for DIW was developed and deployed. LayerUp uniquely combines capabilities to generate complex toolpaths for 5 -axis printing, corrects for substrate surface variations and handles high precision multi -material dispensing and flow control. LayerUp also provides a user -friendly interface and quality control capability to support rigorous nuclear security enterprise qu alification needs. Compared to the previous scripting R&D solution, LayerUp reduces the toolpath computation time from 3 hours to 7 minutes . Notably, LayerUp has been selected as the baseline software for W80 -4 LEP polymer DIW components and is being adopted by the W87 -1 program for both polymer and thermoset DIW components. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-46 3.5.2.1 Status DOE/NNSA must achieve higher technology and manufacturing readiness levels and buy down risks , enabling faster insertion of new technologies into weapon systems for the modernization programs to succeed in reducing costs and increasing agility . Programs associated with the Weapon Component and Material Process Development capability continue to develop and improve multi -system component and manufacturing processes, reducing costs , and improving schedule execution for the nuclear security enterprise. Current processes and infrastructure are inadequate to meet goals for rapid design, production, testing, and qualification of equipment and technologies to meet modernization needs. These inadequacies are hampering focus on development efforts separate from production demand, which has reduced the ability to innovate new solutions that could help assure responsiveness to future needs. Advances in the Weapon Component and Material Process Development capability are currently constrained by aging infrastructur e and associated reliability risks. Aging manufacturing equipment is leading to increased downtime and reduced product yield. At the same time, sustaining or restarting legacy processes is affected by equipment and material obsolescence. DOE/NNSA must a lso address facility capacity issues due to the increased production demand from multiple concurrent modernization programs. DOE/NNSA is performing AoA studies to seek ways to mitigate any potential adverse effects to existing and future programs caused b y insufficient facility capacity and emerging production needs. 3.5.3 Weapon Component and System Prototyping The Weapon Component and System Prototyping capability supports efforts to develop, test, analyze, and manufacture high -fidelity, full -scale prototype w eapon components and systems to reduce the cost and cycle times required to develop modern designs and technologies prior to production. This capability includes the ability to design, manufacture, and employ mock -ups with sensors to support laboratory an d flight tests that will provide component functionality evidence with DoD delivery systems in realistic environments. Identifying, developing, and sustaining process expertise and prototyping is crucial to scientific understanding, production agility, re sponsiveness, and efficiency in the ever -changing threat environment. The Weapon Component and System Prototyping capability supports DOE/NNSA to replace sunset technologies and obsolete materials and use technological advances from industry and academia . This approach provides weapon designers the opportunities to take prudent risks before use in stockpile warheads, facilitates rapid/accelerated learning cycles, and integrates multidisciplinary, multi -site teams to support laboratory and flight tests to provide evidence that components will function in relevant environments. Weapon Component and System Prototyping facilitates an effective nuclear deterrent through proactive design and innovative weapon technologies development . Such activities may incl ude: Developing technology insertion options to prepare the nuclear stockpile for changing global security environments, such as advanced hardware design for nuclear explosive packages, Weapon Component and Material Process Development Accomplis hments The capability to print high performance thermoset epoxy composites using existing DIW tools has been established. The Additive Manufacturing Thermosets team has rapidly on -boarded the technology and printed different prototype iterations for analysis and consideration for use on the W87-1. These materials and processes provide additive manufacturing technologies that are readily adaptable to design changes and potentially more manufacturable than conventional technologies. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-47 energetics, microelectronics/microprocessors, mechanisms, GTSs, . Partnering with DoD's Science and Technology community to mature and demonstrate integrated system architectures to accelerate innovation and reduce risks in the nuclear weapons development life cycle. 3.5.3.1 Status Aging fac ilities and legacy processes are not easily, or economically, modifiable to new technologies. DOE/NNSA requires capabilities to provide rapid development cycles through modular systems, rapid prototyping, integrated simulation, and realistic combined envi ronments testing to develop components and systems. The ability to realize designs quickly and receive rapid feedback will promote innovation as risks and barriers to participation are lowered. Advancements in science and technology improve warhead perfo rmance and manufacturing. Recently, innovatively appl ying additive manufacturing and model -based systems engineering have created new approaches for weapon technology prototyping. These new technologies will provide options to solve warhead issues that can be implemented more quickly, cost less, and/or provide greater performance than is possible with existing technologies and processes. 3.5.4 Advanced Manufacturing The Advanced Manufacturing capability advances novel manufacturing processes to enable a responsive and resilient nuclear security enterprise. These inno vations simultaneously open component design space while reducing component R&D costs. In addition, benefits from advanced manufacturing capabilities include a reduc ed manufacturing footprint, waste, and facility operating costs and increased production t hroughput and improved manufacturing safety basis. This capability underpins innovation in future nuclear weapons systems and allows the enterprise to quickly respond to emerging issues in the current stockpile and respond to future weapons requirements resulting from an evolving geopolitical landscape. Many advanced manufacturing capabilities are available for the future production capabilities , including additive manufacturing for metals and polymers, injection molding, standing up internal materials pro duction capabilities and new materials with better properties, and manufacturing simulation capabilities. 3.5.4.1 Status All new advanced manufacturing technologies require stringent R&D to ensure the components produced by these new methods can meet or exceed t he requirements of legacy components. This requirement allows the enterprise to field new concepts for the entire life cycle of a weapons system without needing underground nuclear explosive testing. DOE/NNSA created a long -term Advanced Manufacturing Strategic Program Plan linked to the Nuclear Weapons Council strategic guidance, and the Technology Development Strategic Plan to implement this requirement . The plan covers objectives including continuous improvement on processes, securing materials and component supply chains, adopting modern, risk -based manufacturing qualification methods, developing efficient and cost -effective manufacturing technologies, r educing time to deploy advanced manufacturing technologies, and discovering the \"art of the possible .\" Efforts across these themes will directly affect the agility and responsiveness of DOE/NNSA's manufacturing infrastructure and will continue to develop the required manufacturing capabilities prior to a future weapon program 's development engineering phase, producing confidence in the schedules and cost estimates for those programs. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-48 Emerging advanced technology solutions will enable a flexible, digital -based enterprise that will use a common set of trusted models and simulations throughout the entire product life cycle. Benefits include reduc ed and errors ; ability to simulate and predict outcomes for critical manufacturing processes , thereby reducing the iterations needed for manufacturing development, rapid ly incorporati ng requirements modifications, and enhanced producibility, agility, and responsiveness. The DOE/NNSA sites are working collectively to rapidly advance additive manufacturing , an emerging technology , for nuclear deterrence applications. DOE/NNSA established a multi -site Additive Manufacturing Coordinating Team to coordinate activities across the enterprise. There are many benefits the enterprise is realizing from additive manufacturing i ncluding customized tooling and fixturing, weapon component weight reduction, and rapid prototyping. Technology maturation for advanced manufacturing must be aligned with current and future warhead modernization schedules to become responsive to future ch allenges and execute the current program of record. 3.5.5 Challenges and Strategies Table 3-12 provides a high -level summary of the Weapon Component Production area challenges and the strategies to address them. Table 3-12. Summary of the Weapon Component Production area challenges and strategies Challenges Strategies Current Strategy Being Implemented Future Strategies Needed Cross -program Integration: Extensive interactions are necessary across program elements, to ensure the full suite of advanced manufacturing capabilities are matured in time for future programs of record. These maturation activities are multi - disciplinary and often very broad in scope because engineering and material science functions are required throughout the life cycle of a weapon system. Program managers meet regularly to identify opportunities and effect coordination. Additionally, regular meetings with Management and Operati ng managers help to inform and discuss emerging issues and maturation progress. Earlier and more frequent communication across federal program managers and Management and Operating managers to ensure early collaboration and consensus on necessary activiti es. Identification of Risks: Lack of high - fidelity risk assessment contributes to missing insertion opportunities for advanced technology and engineering into the stockpile or adding new or enhanced manufacturing capabilities for production. Risks identified later in a technology or manufacturing process maturation leads to additional unforeseen R&D scope that needs additional resources and time to buy down. The resultant schedule slip increases the likelihood the technology will not be ready in time for insertion to the stockpile. Maturation of advanced manufacturing capabilities is strengthened by using product business cases and partnerships across programs to understand the risk extent for inserting the new capability into the stockpile. Ensure early stakeholder engage ment in the technology development cycle to best understand the full range of risks to inserting a new technology. Capturing these risks in a business case and using the R&D phase of a technology to buy down these risks and discover additional risks with more than enough time to explore solutions before stockpile insertion. R&D = research and development Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-49 3.6 Weapon Assembly , Storage, Testing, and Disposition Area After weapon components are produced, each requires assembly into complete warheads and temporary storage before delivery to DoD. Some of these warheads are removed from the stockpile on a yearly basis for surveillance to provide data to evaluate the stockpile 's health. These surveillance activities (such as inspections, laboratory and flig ht tests, nondestructive tests, and component and material evaluations) provide data over time to predict, detect, assess, and resolve aging trends and any observed anomalies. This process requires disassembly and sometimes reassembly. Nuclear weapons un dergo disposition at their end of life , or due to other reasons . This area covers all these capabilities. 3.6.1 Weapon Assembly, Storage, and Disposition The Weapon Assembly, Storage, and Disposition capability involves assembly, disassembly, and inspection of nuclear weapons systems, including lower -level subassembly of components and final assembly of the nuclear and non -nuclear components. All these act ivities require special conduct operations, equipment, facilities, and quality control, and special safety and security processes and protocols. 3.6.1.1 Status DOE/NNSA maintains extensive infrastructure to assemble, disassemble, store, and dispose of weapons at a central site, and R&D capabilities throughout the enterprise. Storage, disassembly , and assembly of components occurs at the production facilities, depending on the mission. Much of this specialized infrastructure is aging, with some facilities exceed ing 50 years of age. Capital investments are essential to the overall strategy for modernization of this capability. Programmatic equipment that supports this capability is also degrading due to age and condition, and some pieces are becoming obsolete du e to unavailab le parts and emerg ing new technology. Sophisticated measurement devices, vacuum chambers, gloveboxes, ovens of many types, lathes of varying sizes, environmental chambers and rooms, and various types of nondestructive testing such as radiogr aphy, laser gas sampling, and computed tomography that all contribute to the viability of this capability and depend on this specialized equipment remaining robust. Some new equipment has been installed, but many additional equipment replacements are need ed to meet mission requirements. As part of the overall strategy, DOE/NNSA is investing in upgrading obsolete items of equipment and the facilities in which the equipment is used. 3.6.2 Weapon Component and System Surveillance and Assessment This capability e valuates weapons and components across weapons -relevant environments to demonstrate that stockpile systems continue to meet design and performance requirements. Such evaluations occur through inspections, laboratory and flight tests, destructive and nonde structive tests, and component and material appraisals. Comparing surveillance results over time provides the ability to detect, assess, and resolve aging trends and abnormal changes in the stockpile , potentially predict phenomena before the stockpile is affected , and address or mitigate issues or concerns. 3.6.2.1 Status The Weapon Component and System Surveillance and Assessment capability is essential to surveillance and assessment activities and depends on a broad array of specialized equipment. DOE/NNSA possesses a flexible and dynamic evaluation plan that responds to emerging issues and new information, thus enabling adjustments as conditions change and key priorities remain met. This planning include s identifying issues with the aforementioned equipment and mitigating them accordingly. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-50 3.6.3 Testing Equipment Design and Fabrication The Testing Equipment Design and Fabrication capability includes special test equipment design, fabrication, and deployment to simulate environmental and functional conditions and collect performance and diagnostic data to evaluate against requirements. Data from test equipment provide evidence for process qualification, weapon certification, reliability, surety, product acceptan ce, and stockpile evaluation and are used to evaluate performance at all assembly levels. 3.6.3.1 Status Due to the age of current testers and associated equipment, it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain replacement parts, acquire software upgrades, and m aintain test equipment for production and surveillance. As a result, operational quantities of some test equipment are diminishing. Furthermore, data quantity and complexity requiring collection and processing has challenged the sites' ability to handle, analyze, store, and transfer data. Efforts continue to enhance the common tester architecture, improve trusted, robust test solutions, and develop the next -generation foundation bus that will improve connectivity, interchangeability, and multi -use compat ibility with components and systems in the future. A surveillance tester sustainment effort has been initiated and surveillance testers (and potential risk) are regularly assessed through stockpile evaluation program planning. 3.6.4 Challenges and Strategies Table 3-13 provides a high -level summary of Weapon Assembly, Storage, Testing, and Disposition area challenges and the strategies to address them. Table 3-13. Summary of Weapon Assembly, Storage, Testing, and Disposition area challenges and strategies Challenges Strategies Current Strategy Being Implemented Future Strategies Needed It is difficult to obtain r eplacement equipment and infrastructure provision s (facilities, infrastructure, and utilities) to adequately perform weapon assembly storage and disposition. Identif y aging facilities and infrastructure in advance and corresponding plans and campaigns for upgrades and replacements. Current strategy is suf ficient. It is difficult to obtain r eplacement equipment, testers, software , and related infrastructure provisions necessary to adequately perform testing and component and system surveillance . Identif y aging equipment and sunset technologies in advance and mitigation strategies to compensate for gaps and diminishing quantities of hardware . Current strategy is sufficient. Numerous capabilities and resources have strained or insufficient capacity to meet sustainment and modernization demands. Cross -complex working groups priorit ize activities to minimize impacts. Current strategy is sufficient. Aging testers supporting surveillance are becoming unreliable and unsupportable due to sunset technologies . Sites partner with Headquarters to migrate surveillance test capability from old and unsupportable testers to modern, common platform testers to support components that are common across multiple programs. This migration not only makes the common platform te ster sustainable for the future and reduces . Required floorspace for surveillance testing. Tester refresh/migration to a common platform for components that will be surveilled as those components approach last production unit. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-51 3.7 Transportation and Security Area The Transportation and Security area involves DOE/NNSA's capabilities for protecting the people, places, information, and other aspects critical to the nuclear security enterprise 's function . The Secure Transportation capa bility provides safe, secure transport of the Nation's nuclear weapons, weapon components, and SNM throughout the nuclear security enterprise to support DOE/NNSA operations. The Safeguards and Security capability protects all nuclear materials, infrastruc ture assets, information, and the workforce at DOE/NNSA sites involved in Weapons Activities programs and operations. The IT and Cybersecurity capability supports secure electronic connectivity across the enterprise and guards against threats to data inte grity. 3.7.1 Secure Transportation Nuclear weapon warhead modernization , LLC exchanges , surveillance, dismantlement, nonproliferation activities , and experimental programs rely on transporting weapons, weapon components, and SNM on schedule and in a safe and sec ure manner. The Secure Transportation capability supports DOE/NNSA's goals , including to consolidat ing nuclear material storage and reduc ing the dangers and environmental risks posed by domestic ally transport ing nuclear cargo. This capability includes design and fabrication or vehicle modification, leading edge communication systems, and Federal Agents training . Weapons Activities missions receive the highest priority, but the Secure Transportation capability also provides secure transport fo r other DOE/NNSA programs and offices, such as the DOE/NNSA Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response Program, the DOE/NNSA Office of Naval Reactors, and DOE Office of Nuclear Energy, as well as DoD and other U.S. Government agencies. The capability also supports nuclear materials recovery from partner nations. The Secure Transportation Asset (STA) Program, which provides this capability, has a record of 100 percent safe and secure shipments without compromise, loss of components, or release of radio active material. STA is U.S. Government owned and operated due to the control and coordination required and the potential security consequences of material loss or compromise. 3.7.1.1 Status STA must maintain assets to sustain convoy safety and security to support missions based on changing customer needs and current and future threats. These assets include vehicles (trailers, armored tractors, escort vehicles, and support vehicles), aircraft, and a highly trained Federal Agent workforce. The process of ide ntifying, designing, procuring, and manufacturing vehicles takes several years. The Safeguards Transporter (SGT) fleet vehicles reached the end of the projected design life cycle in 2018. STA is sustaining this capability by implementing risk -reduction i nitiatives to extend the life of the SGT until the replacement, known as the Mobile Guardian Transporter (MGT), is fully integrated into mission operations. The MGT will assure weapon -related cargo and containers ' safety and security , protect the public, and meet nuclear explosive safety standards. A business case analysis to review options for replacing STA aircraft fleet was performed in FY 2018. The analysis supported a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 replacement and a long -range replacement plan for the current fleet of two Boeing 737 aircraft. STA procured a 737 (replacement for the DC -9) in FY 2021 and is planning for the first 737 life cycle replacement in 2027 and the second in 2032. As with other capabilities, STA is committed to a robust human resources strategy that recruits and retains people with the requisite skills to meet priorities and mission requirements. This strategy considers the many years it takes to achieve growth in the Federal Agent workforce due to the stringent hiring process, Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-52 security clearances, and attrition. During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID -19) pandemic, STA's mission has not ceased \u2014STA's ability to effectively meet customer requirements proved STA t o be highly dynamic and adaptable to the ever -changing environment. 3.7.1.2 Challenges and Strategies Table 3-14 provides a high -level summary of Secure Transportation Asset challenges and the strategies to address them. Table 3-14. Summary of Secure Transportation Asset chal lenges and strategies Challenges Strategies Current Strategy Being Implemented Future Strategies Needed The SGT fleet is beyond its design life and sustaining it involves challenges such as unavailable or obsolete parts, difficulty finding new manufacturers, the high cost of limited -run production, and meeting Nuclear Explosive Safety Study requirements. Support SGT risk -reduction program and continue design and p roduction activities toward development of the MGT. Work with partners to identify mitigation strategies, address Nuclear Safety Study requirements, and sustain the required readiness posture of the STA fleet. Continue to evaluate, update, and replace STA assets as required to meet mission. Incorporate MGT into mission operations as fleet becomes available (beginning in FY 2027). MGT = Mobile Guardian Transporter SGT = Safeguards Transporter STA = Secure Transportation Asset 3.7.2 Safeguards and Security The Safeguards and Security (S&S) capability protects NNSA personnel, facilities, nuclear weapons, and SNM from a full spectrum of specified threats at its national laboratories, production plants, processing facilities, and securit y sites. This capability protects the enterprise from theft, diversion, sabotage, espionage, unauthorized access, compromise, and other hostile or noncompliant acts that adversely affect national security. The S&S program achieves this capability by ensuring integration amongst several components including protective forces, physical security systems, information security, personnel security, material control and accountability, and security program operatio ns and planning. 3.7.2.1 Status DOE/NNSA must maintain the safety and security of the nuclear security enterprise and its workforce despite changing mission needs and ever -evolving threats. The following outlines the status of each S&S component and how it supports the entire NNSA mission. DOE/NNSA is projecting an unprecedented increase in protective force personnel through FY 2027 in support of known mission growth across the nuclear security enterprise, including the pit production mission. DOE/NNSA's standardization initiative for life cycle replacement of its aged rifles will achieve 100 percent completion during FY 2022. DOE/NNSA con tinues to employ proprietary state -of-the-art physical security systems to protect key sites. A modernized security system is currently under development, with testing projected to occur in FY 2022 and 2023. Planned counter unmanned aircraft systems proj ects are at various stages of installation, and testing efforts continue at several sites. For specific system and site information refer to the classified Annex. DOE/NNSA eliminated the personnel security clearance inventory backlog and continues to upgr ade the web -based Clearance Action Tracking System, develop policy, and update training that support s federally mandated Trusted Workforce requirements. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 3-53 DOE/NNSA, in partnership with the National Training Center, initiated the contractor Material Control a nd Accountability Technical Qualification Program Pilot . More than 135 individuals have received training during eight separate sessions. The Material Control and Accountability Technical Qualification Program is critical to addressing significant attrition and turnover of material control and accountability personnel across the enterprise , and the program will continue into FY 2023. DOE/NNSA supports mission growth by prioritizi ng programs and projects based on prudent risk management and acceptance. DOE/NNSA continues to implement the Design Basis Threat (DBT) policy , specifically, the DBT 's Change 1 requires a security posture assessment against new threats, followed by the ap propriate adjustments. DOE/NNSA continues to refine and implement a comprehensive risk management framework to inform nuclear security decisions. Growth within Weapons Activities programs requires increases to the S&S capabilities including additional personnel in the various security disciplines along with corresponding investments to maintain and modernize security infrastructure and technologies. 3.7.2.2 Challenges and Strategies Table 3-15 provides a high -level summary of Safeguards and Security challenges a nd the strategies to address them.

The NNSA OCIO has implemented an organizational structure that supports its functions under three organizations : the Office of Information Technology, the Office of Cybersecurity, and the Office of Mission Integration to effectively achieve its mission . The IT and Cybersecurity program provides information management, IT, and cybersecurity support to the nuclear se curity enterprise through investments in cybersecurity capabilities, cloud -based technologies, and IT infrastructure. The NNSA OCIO enhances the nuclear security enterprise 's information management through using a combination of technology, policy, and ri sk management practices. NNSA OCIO leverages new and existing technologies to assist and protect DOE and NNSA nuclear mission s in an increasingly complex cyber environment. It also collaborates and coordinates with the DOE's Office of the Chief Informati on Officer on IT and cybersecurity solutions development and deployment to protect DOE information and information assets. The major elements of the IT and Cybersecurity program, supported by Mission Integration, are illustrated in Figure 3-5. Figure 3-5.

Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the IT and Cybersecurity program has expanded its support boundary to be able to continue accommodat ing working from home and for extensive videoconferen cing, including classified videoconferencing for a large portion of the workforce. 3.7.3.1.2 The Current and Future Anticipated Mission Requirements The need for agility is critical , as the required responses to the cyber environment necessitate constant monitoring and response and demand increasingly advanced technology to protect information. 3.7.3.1.3 Current State of the Infrastructure The NNSA OCIO is currently modernizing the infrastructure to provide the best possible protection of information at the best lev el of service. 3.7.3.1.4 Current State of the Workforce The NNSA OCIO acknowledges the challenges of recruiting and retaining top talent due to competition for IT and cybersecurity resources, especially in a pandemic situation. It will continue its efforts to meet current and future workforce needs by analyzing job requirements to meet the mission's evolving needs. By doing so, the NNSA OCIO will continue to be a competitive employer that can recruit, develop, and retain top talent in the IT and cybersecurity workf orce. 3.7.3.2 Challenges and Strategies The highly complex and global nature of NNSA and its nuclear security enterprise, coupled with limited resources, makes it critically important that information and information assets are secured, managed, and protected usin g a risk -management approach. As the cybersecurity threat landscape constantly evolves, it is critical for NNSA OCIO to keep up and adapt to the ever -changing IT, OT, and cybersecurity landscape and to respond rapidly to the evolving and most sophisticate d threats.

Demand on the existing infrastructure is increasing due to multiple concurren t stockpile modernization programs and the need to advance science, technology, and engineering activities at DOE/NNSA's labs, plants, and sites. These factors present many complex challenges, particularly given DOE/NNSA's aging infrastructure. Despite t hese challenges, and with congressional support, DOE/NNSA has increased the resources allocated to and made significant progress in modernizing its infrastructure, eliminating excess facilities, and improving management practices. This chapter provides a broad view of infrastructure and operations across the nuclear security enterprise and shows how DOE/NNSA conducts infrastructure planning and management to capture infrastructure activitivies that support multiple capabilities, such as mission enabling construction, minor construction , and sustainment activities. This chapter also addresses how infrastructure suppor ts the Weapons Activities capability areas discussed in Chapter 3. Infrastructure is an essential element of each capability, as shown in Figure 3 -2, and as mentioned in the capability sections of each key capital project in Chapter 3 . Figure 4-1 illust rates the size and scope of DOE/NNSA 's nuclear security enterprise infrastructure that drive s the challenges and strategies discussed in this chapter. Comprehensive enterprise asset management requires continuous, multi -level planning across the full spec trum of asset types, resulting in balanced enterprise investment decision -making across the entire asset management life cycle, as shown in Figure 4-2. Planning initiates an asset's life cycle, followed by acquisition through new construction, lease, or p urchase. The majority of an asset's life is spent in continuous sustainment through maintenance, repairs, and replacements -in-kind, with periodic recapitalizations to upgrade and extend the asset's service life prior to disposition. This chapter describe s these life cycle asset management activities. Infrastructure and Operations Major Accomplishments Completed construction of the New Albuquerque Complex providing 333,000 square feet of modern office space for 1,200 employees.

DOE/NNSA infrastructure size and scope Figure 4-2. Asset management life cycle Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-3 The asset management life cycle model shown in Figure 4-2 illustrates the different types of investments across various funding sources and sponsoring programs. Sections 4.1 through 4.4 describe the activities within the asset management model. Infrastructure planning and asset management, described in Section 4.1, estima tes future repair and modernization investments in facilities as they age, forecasting facility replacement schedules, planning for new and replacement acquisitions, and anticipating the disposition needs and excess facilities' costs for completion in a ti mely manner. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 describe acquisition strategies as well as modernization and sustainment activities for existing facilities that support capabilities needed to sustain the stockpile. Section 4.2 discusses t he plan s for programmatic const ruction by area and the action s being taken to sustain, recreate, and improve the capabilities detailed in Chapter 3. Section 4.4 addresses disposition of excess facilities. Sections 4.2 through 4.4 also discuss a wide range of programs, processes, and f unding types, which reflect the complexity of aligning investment needs to funding sources. Facility acquisition occurs through line -item projects, minor construction, purchase, or leasing. Operating, maintaining, and revitalizing existing facilities are funded through minor construction, recapitalization, maintenance , and other programs. The funding strategy to support any given type of project can vary greatly due to the project's size, scope , and other factors. In addition to modernizing DOE/NNSA's phy sical infrastructure that directly support s the Weapons Activities programs , continuous investments are required to sustain and modernize both critical physical security and cybersecurity elements across the nuclear security enterprise. 4.1 Infrastructure Pla nning and Asset Management Infrastructure planning and asset management covers the planning phase for operational and capital investment needs. Operational planning involves the maintenance, repair, and operation of facilities, utilities, and equipment a t the sites, and strategic investment planning for major system upgrades and replacement s. Capital investment planning involves identifying future and anticipat ed emerging needs in the weapons programs, as well as science and technology investments to support those missions into the foreseeable future. Operational and capital investment planning must work in tandem to achieve the desired balance and cost -effective ness that reflects capable asset management. DOE/NNSA has taken considerable action over the last 5 years to better understand the nuclear security enterprise's long -term strategic investment needs. Previous capital planning efforts gave insufficient cons ideration to the long -term infrastructure needs in sustaining/renewing existing assets , and future needs tied to emerging capabilities and anticipated future workloads. DOE/NNSA's most recent integrated strategic planning efforts have yielded a much more realistic and time -critical view of out -year infrastructure needs to support the mission and long -term sustainment of capabilities. The processes for identifying and planning for these long -term needs are now greatly improved and expanded. Direct mission needs have been better integrated with routine infrastructure sustainment and renewal processes to create a clearer, more comprehensive plan for long -term investments. Bottom -up planning across the nuclear security enterprise has been improved through are a planning, described below, and Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-4 deep dive reviews. Asset management software has provided accessible data for earlier maintenance a nd sustainment needs planning. Because of this expanded, more integrated planning, DOE/NNSA has a more comprehensive understanding of the state of its physical assets and the actions needed to acquire, sustain, recapitalize, and dispose of its assets . These processes are also aligned much more closely with industry standards. The asset management life cycle, shown in Figure 4 -2, is the basis for all investment planning within DOE/NNSA. It can be applied to a single facility or, if applied to numerous facilities, can be used to organize the way the infrastructure program operates. The elements of the cycle must remain in balanc e to keep the nuclear security enterprise assets healthy. While the model appears straightforward, the processes employed to achieve balance across multiple facilities for the purpose of meeting multiple competing priorities are not. In the DOE/NNSA envi ronment, decision - making is complicated by multiple funding mechanisms, guidance, and requirements. Th is section include s definitions of terms and background to aid in understanding these intricacies and the nuclear security enterprise's broad extent of i nvestment planning and execution. 4.1.1 Area Planning The newest element of DOE/NNSA's planning process is area plan ning , which connect s plans to projects for achieving DOE/NNSA's Strategic Vision for the future nuclear security enterprise. The area plans provide detailed information on the life cycle management strategies of co -located or functionally similar facilities, buildings, and o ther structures. Area plans are part of an integrated planning process that flows from high -level requirements to interdependent project plans. Frequent communication among stakeholders at all levels through infrastructure deep dives and other forums ke eps the planning process align ed with DOE/NNSA mission needs. Area plans blend multiple funding sources and are regularly updated to reflect the latest developments and priorities. DOE/NNSA and its M&O partners have been developing area plans, representin g assets and associated capabilities across the nuclear security enterprise. These area plans showcase important elements of each capability's long -term infrastructure plans and span direct mission and mission -enabling capabilities. They cover a myriad o f topical areas, from flagship experimental facilities and weapon components to utilities and emergency services. When viewed collectively, area plans provide a roadmap for modernizing DOE/NNSA infrastructure to deliver the mission. 4.1.2 Weapons Activities Lin e-Item Planning Integration The Weapons Activities line-item planning integration process establishes procedures to consolidate the line-item data collection process and synchronize infrastructure planning across Weapons Activities programs. The integrate d planning process is conducted in collaboration with the DOE/NNSA laboratories, plants, and sites to identify and prioritize major line-item construction projects for Weapons Activities programs. This prioritization informs near - and long -term planning e fforts for programmatic and mission -enabling construction projects. It also informs the Future Years Nuclear Security Program (FYNSP ) programming and budgeting process as projects reach appropriate milestones. Infrastructure Deep Dives DOE/NNSA holds meetings with each management and operating (M&O) partner site to discuss mission requirements, related infrastructure needs, asset condition and life cycle management, and propo sed investment plans. Deep dives lay the foundation for prioritized, integrated area plans and a Master Asset Plan for the nuclear security enterprise. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-5 Programmatic infrastructure investments are linked to mission -specific functions within Weapons Activities, such as plutonium modernization. They address investment needs for direct programmatic infrastructure including facilities, computers, diagnostic equipment, weapon -related production facilities and equipment, or anything else that enables the nuclear security enterprise to carry out resea rch, testing, production, and sustainment activities to meet its national security missions. In contrast, mission -enabling infrastructure provides support for programmatic activities, including general purpose office buildings, site -wide support facilitie s, utilities, and equipment. Both types of investments are required to sustain Weapons Activities capabilities in the near - term and for the foreseeable future. Consolidating line -item investment proposals combine s multiple current data collection processe s and ensures a consistent, repeatable planning process for all line-item construction projects. The program office s' comprehensive review of project proposals ensures all current and proposed line-item construction projects (detailed in Sections 4.2.1 - 4.2.2) represent necessary investments to support the program of record. The cost estimation process for proposals within capital acquisition is described in Chapter 5, Section 5.9.3 . 4.1.3 Critical Decision Acquisition Milestone Process A basic understanding of DOE's Critical Decision (CD) acquisition milestone process is integral to understanding current and planned line -item construction projects and major item of equipment ( MIE) projects. DOE Order 413.3B, Chg 6, Program and Project Management for the Acquisi tion of Capital Assets , outlines a series of staged approvals for line -item and MIE projects greater than $50 million, each of which is referred to as a CD. Each CD stage requires specific deliverables prior to and during the process in order to progress to the next stage. Figure 4-3 shows the four phases of the CD process (Initiation, Definition, Execution, and Closeout), with their corresponding CD stages. Activities prior to CD-0 (Approve Mission Need ) through approval of CD-1 (Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range ) constitute the Definition Phase . These activities are prerequisites to commencing the Execution Phase, which includes approval of CD-2 (Approve Performance Baseline ), approval of CD-3 (Approve Start of Construction ), and activities up to CD -4.1 Approval of CD-4 (Approve Start of Operations or Project Completion ) reflect s project completion based on previously determined criteria and the approval to transition to operations. DOE/NNSA Supplemental Directive 413.3 prov ides further guidance on this process , including that DOE/NNSA typically combines CD -2 and CD -3. The approval of CD -4 is predicated on the readiness to operate and/or maintain the system, facility, or capability. Transition and turnover do not necessaril y terminate all project activit ies. In some cases, it marks a point at which the operations organizations assume responsibility for operating and maintaining the new facility. 1 See DOE Order 413.3B for details regarding projects requiring long -lead procurement. If long -lead procurements are executed prior to CD -3 approval for the proj ect, this is designated as CD -3A and requires an additional stand -alone CD by the Project Management Executive. DOE/NNSA Capital Construction Levels Line-item - a capital project greater than $25 million, so -called because it has its own line in DOE/NNSA's budget structure . Minor Construc tion - a construction project less than $25 million that includes projects also referred to as General Plant Projects, Institutional General Plant Projects , and Accelerator Improvement Projects . Institutional General Plant Project - a minor construction pro ject that addresses an institutional, multi -program, general site need rather than a specific program need, using funding derived from indirect cost pools . General Plant Project - a miscellaneous minor construction project of a general nature, for which the total estimated cost may not exceed the congressionally established limit.

Critical Decision process 4.2 Acquisition DOE/NNSA has more than 5,000 facilitie s with an average age of 47 years. Many of the largest and most complex facilities will require line -item construction projects to accomplish modernization or replacement. Since aging facilities represent increasing risk to mission execution and line -item projects require significant coordination and funding over multiple years, DOE/NNSA continues to evaluate line -item construction project proposals as a part of the overall 25 -year plan for Weapons Activities. DOE/NNSA's line -item construction portfolio requires consistent, stable, and timely funding. The size and complexities of these projects present several program and project management challenges. However, DOE/NNSA has demonstrated success despite the complexity of the DOE/NNSA acquisition processe s and the challenge of meeting enterprise needs in a responsive and timely manner. Since aging facilities represent increasing risk to mission execution, DOE/NNSA continues to review line-items across the nuclear security enterprise to better ensure infras tructure is in place to meet mission requirements, while improving DOE/NNSA's facility condition and reducing the average facility age to a sustainable level. Figure 4-4 demonstrates the DOE/NNSA's facilities' historical average age growth and the planned reduction in average age after completing the projects described in the following sections. The average age presented here varies from similar charts in previous Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plans (SSMPs) as the average age calculation was expand ed from using a few hundred representative programmatic facilities to all DOE/NNSA facilities. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-7 Figure 4-4. Historical and projected average age of all DOE/NNSA facilities This section discusses the current and planned line -items for the nuclear security enterprise. Programmatic line -items are presented by Weapons Activities capability area (formerly termed portfolio), followed by mission -enabling line -items. 4.2.1 Programmatic C onstruction Programmatic construction projects are categorized according to the Weapons Activities capability areas, which are detailed in Chapter 3. Sections 4.2.1.1 -4.2.1.7 describe current and proposed line -item projects within each capability area, in cluding their projected schedules and cost ranges. Project proposals (Pre-CD-0) represent potential mission gaps and emerging requirements across the nuclear security enterprise . They require additional vetting before DOE/NNSA moves forward with addressi ng the gap with a material solution. The projected schedules and cost ranges shown represent one potential planning scenario and may change in future SSMPs as stockpile and enterprise requirements are refined . 4.2.1.1 Weapon Science and Engineering Line-item proj ects in the Weapon Science and Engineering area encompass the suite of physical sciences and engineering disciplines that comprise the theoretical and experimental capabilities needed to assess the current nuclear stockpile and design and certify future st ockpile weapons. Current planning estimates and schedule dates for projects in this area are listed in Figure 4-5. Plans for the sustainment of the Z pulsed power facility (Z) and Omega Laser Facility (Omega) are not included in this figure because they are not proposed as line -item projects. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-8 Figure 4-5. 25-year programmatic line -item schedule for ongoing and proposed projects related to Weapon Science and Engineering DOE/NNSA is currently executing three programmatic line-item construction projects in the Weapon Science and Engineering area that are past CD -1. Cost and schedule estimates for these projects vary from conceptual design -based estimates to baselined project estimates: The High Explosive Science and Engineering (HESE) Facility will construct three new buildings to provide a technology development laboratory and office space for technical staff. It will replace 15 current Manhattan Project -era facilities at the Pantex Plant (Pantex), support the high explosives ( HE) Center of Ex cellence for Manufacturing mission for DOE/NNSA, and help sustain high -quality scientific staff. The average age of the facilities to be replaced is 68 years old. The HESE facility will be approximately 73,000 square feet. Project design is complete and received CD-2/3 approval in April 2022. Site preparation and long -lead procurement activities started at the beginning of fiscal year (FY) 2021. Main works construction started in May 2022. The Advanced Sources and Detectors project is an MIE2 that will fill the pulsed x -radiography capability gap through developing a multi -pulse linear induction electron accelerator. The scope includes design, technical maturation, fabrication, testing, insta llation, commissioning, and readiness execution at the U1a Complex. The U1a Complex Enhancements Project (UCEP) will provide infrastructure modifications to the U1a Complex at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) to house and field multi -pulse radiogra phy. This project includes structures, systems, and components necessary for deploying 2 MIEs are capital equipment with a cost that exceeds $5 million. In most cases, capital equipment is installed with no constr uction cost. How ever, in cases where the equipment requires supporting construction provision, the associated construction activities must be acquired through a line -item construction project, or a minor construction project if the cost is below the minor construction thr eshold established by Congress. MIEs follow a similar CD process as line -item capital asset projects. See DOE Order 413.3B for additional details. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-9 Enhanced Capabilities for Subcritical Experiment Advanced Sources and Detectors Project's pulsed X -ray radiography equipment. It also includes support systems for pote ntial future neutron -diagnosed subcritical experiments technology, which will produce valuable data on the neutron behavior of aged plutonium and other phenomena associated with the final stages of a weapon implosion. The following programmatic line-item project in the Weapon Science and Engineering area is in the Definition Phase of the CD process (CD -0 to CD -1): The Energetic Materials Characterization (EMC) project will support research and development (R&D) to advance predictive capabilities for safety and performance assessments and qualification and surveillance, evaluate material responses to all phases of the stockpile -to-target sequence, resolve significant finding investigations (SFIs) involving energetic materials, provide technical data on which to base annual weapon assessments, and develop new/replacement materials to support evolving HE technical requirements. The project will consolidate 18 structures into a single modern facility to increase operational efficiency and reduc e operating costs. In addition to projects in the Definition and Execution Phases, DOE/NNSA is considering several programmatic line -item proposals in the Weapon Science and Engineering area (Pre -CD-0). These project proposals are a part of the planning process but should not be considered part of the program of record until they achieve appropriate approvals . Descriptions of scope should be considered illustrative, as alternative selections will not be made until each project completes an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) and the project achieves CD -1: The Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) Modernization Project (LAMP) would be a one-time capital investment to replace the front end of the LANSCE accelerator. This w ould eliminate end -of-life and obsolete components to improve reliability, availability, maintainability, efficiency, and safety , and would allow LANSCE to support as sessment and certification, which is required through at least 2050. The National Ignition Facility ( NIF) Laser and Experimental System Revitalization is part of a broader effort of NIF sustainment aimed at refurbishment, recapitalization , and improvement of the NIF facility. This project would support revitalization of the laser systems as part of the 5-year plan to ensure NIF continues to deliver for the Stockpile Stewardship Program . The Increased Laser Power and Energy on NIF project w ould upgrade the NIF laser, which is currently operating at its highest sustained levels of energy and power to date, made possible only by continued investments in optics and laser technology. Recent ignition experiments show that small increases in laser energy could su bstantially increase fusion output. Four energy and power upgrade paths are being assessed within the limitations of the current facility. The Building 851 Next Generation Cinematographic Moderate Energy Radiography Capability would upgrade the Building 8 51 open firing site to include a 10 mega -electron volt 20 -pulse linear induction acceleration and a dense plasma focus for flash neutron radiography. This project would provide capability for cinematographic x -radiography that w ould enable X -ray movies fo r important weapons physics experiments, expand options for in -demand hydro tests, and deliver high -fidelity data for validating simulations. The Radiological Science Capability project would consolidate and relocate the aging radiological facilities that support Los Alamos National Laboratory ( LANL ) weapons and global security mission requirements. The planned replacement facility w ould support critical missions including Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-10 weapons programs, nu clear forensics, and nonproliferation programs, as well as broad science capabilities (e.g., actinide separation and synthetic chemistry). The New High Energy Density (HED) Capability Support Facility Replacement project w ould support experimental throughp ut for the national user facility at NIF with a building that w ould house key functions such as production and fabrication for target s, diagnostics, and optics in support of HED physics experiments. The new building would provide advanced clean room and laboratory facilities for the next generations of targets and diagnostics for HED physics . The Next Gen Pulsed Power facility is a significant long -term goal of the DOE/NNSA's Inertial Confinement Fusion program to fill a capability gap in the environment s currently accessible a t facilities such as NIF, Z , and Saturn. The Next Gen Pulsed Power facility would have increase d efficiency and effectiveness and would modernize infrastructure dedicated to HED experiments. The Dual -Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamics Test (DARHT) Facility Modernization would be a series of activities to ensure continued reliable and resilient high -quality data return s at DARHT. These upgrades would sustain delivery of foundational data for stockpile stewardship and global security. The Building 801A Advanced Radiographic and Diagnostics Hydrodynamic Test Building Upgrade project would build a second -axis with a multi -frame cinematographic capability for imaging weapon physics configurations over a range of densities. The project woul d use the existing Contained Firing Facility and would add non -bunker laboratory space to house an active reset linear induction accelerator or laser based multi -frame radiographic source. The 3D Time Resolved Hydrodynamic -Radiography in a Laser -Explosives Application Facility Replacement project would build a new facility capable of multi -axis, multi -frame imaging of surrogate nuclear weapon -relevant dynamic experiments to meet a wide range of experimental goals, including tomographic reconstruction. The flexibility, resolution , and information content that would be afforded by this laser -driven X -ray source is not possible in existing facilities. 4.2.1.2 Weapon Simulation and Computing Line-item projects in the Weapon Simulation and Computing area enable high performance computing (HPC) and development of the weapons codes, models, and data analytics used to design and assess nuclear weapons systems ' and components ' behavior . Current planning es timates and schedule dates for projects in this area are listed in Figure 4-6. Figure 4-6. 25-year programmatic line-item schedule for ongoing and proposed projects related to Weapon Simulation and Computing Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-11 DOE/NNSA recently completed a project in the Weapon Simulation and Computing area : The Exascale Computing Facility Modernization (ECFM) project modifie d the existing HPC center at LLNL to accommodate the increased infrastructure demands of exascale computing platforms, including upgrades to the facilit y's electrical, cooling, and mechanical capabilities. The existing cooling tower complex was expanded fo r additional cooling, and the electrical system was upgraded to allow additional power for HPC. The project was complete d in May 2022. There are no projects in the Execution or Definition Phases in the Weapon Simulation and Computing area. DOE/NNSA is co nsidering one programmatic line -item proposal in the Weapon Simulation and Computing area (Pre -CD-0). This project proposal is in the planning process but should not be considered a part of the program of record until it achieve s appropriate approvals . The description of scope should be considered illustrative, as alternative selection will not be made until the project completes an AoA and the project achieves CD -1: The Engineering -Data Analytics Facility (EDAF) project w ould construct a new HPC facility that would enable data collection, storage, and analysis capabilit ies by bringing together HPC systems, high -performance data -analytics systems, a scalable data enclave, and an extreme -speed network -backbone to deploy these ca pabilities and enable a future of full -system engineering models. 4.2.1.3 Weapon Design and Integration Line-item projects in the Weapon Design and Integration area support the capabilities needed to research, design, test, analyze, qualify, and integrate componen ts and subsystems into weapon systems that will meet all military requirements and endure all predicted environments. Current planning estimates and schedule dates for projects in this area are listed in Figure 4-7. Figure 4-7. 25-year programmatic line-item schedu le for ongoing and proposed projects related to Weapon Design and Integration The following programmatic line-item project in the Weapon Design and Integration area is in the Definition Phase of the CD process (CD -0 to CD -1): The Combined Radiation Environ ments for Survivability Testing (CREST) project will provide an advanced radiation environmental test capability to fill a mission gap for R&D, qualification, and Upgraded cooling and electrical capabilities upon the completion of ECFM at LLNL Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-12 certification data in combined survivability/threat environments. The Annular Core Research Reactor's (ACRR) current capability provides high -fidelity neutron and gamma -ray environments that emulate nuclear weapon environments to support weapons development and certification. Every weapon system in the stockpile undergoes testing at the ACRR and demand is increasing. However, ACRR is nearly 60 years old , was not designed to house a nuclear reactor, and does not meet modern codes or standards. The facility's age and condition mean ACRR is unable to keep pace with demand. The proposed CREST proj ect will provide a facility that will replace and enhance the legacy capability. This new facility will combine the current ACRR capabilities with an independent gamma -ray irradiation capability in a purpose -built facility specifically optimized to meet c urrent and future stockpile modernization needs. In addition to the project in the Definition Phase, DOE/NNSA is considering a number of programmatic line-item proposals in the Weapon Design and Integration area (Pre-CD-0). These project proposals are in the planning process but should not be considered part of the program of record until they achieve appropriate approvals . The descriptions of scope should be considered illustrative, as alternative selections will not be made until the projects complete a n AoA and the project achieves CD -1: The New Next Generation Life Extension Program R&D Component Fabrication Facility (NextGen Fabrication Facility) would be a joint design agency -production agency (DA -PA) pre-production testbed that c ould assess, develop, tailor, and transition new manufacturing technologies. This w ould provide DOE/NNSA with a capability to accelerate the development and production of non -nuclear components into the weapon modernization process. This joint DA -PA owned collaborative space w ould enable faster and more frequent design iteration s to mature the definition and production process es for production of non -nuclear components , resultin g in accelerated time to first production unit for future modernization programs. The Heterogeneous Integration Facility (HIFac) capability w ould provide DOE/NNSA an enduring supply of trusted strategic radiation hardened microsystems to meet future system functional, environmental, and assurance requirements. Meeting these requirements would likely require the integration of a suite of future products , including semiconductor components, microelectromechanical systems, and photonics components. Heterogen eous Integration w ould improve cost efficiency and reliability through flexibility in combining custom -built and commercially available state -of-the-art technologies. The Gas Transfer Systems and Surety Laboratory (GTS/S) project would meet GTS and Surety mission requirements in the future. The GTS and Surety project w ould provide a modern, lower -maintenance structure capable of meeting the expanded, future demands of the program. Work areas and equipment w ould be upgraded with an efficient layout and sta te-of-the-art technology to meet current and specific testing requirement needs. 4.2.1.4 Weapon Material Processing and Manufacturing Line-item projects in the Weapon Material Processing and Manufacturing area are related to the packaging, processing, handling, and/or manufactur ing of plutonium, uranium, tritium, energetic and hazardous materials, lithium, and other metal and organic materials ne eded for nuclear weapons. Current planning estimates and schedule dates for projects in this area are listed in Figure 4-8. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-13 Figure 4-8. 25-year programmatic line -item schedule for ongoing and proposed projects related to Weapon Material Processing and Manufacturing DOE/NNSA is currently executing multiple programmatic line-item projects in the Weapon Material Processing and Manufacturing area that are past CD -1. Cost and schedule estimates for these projects vary in maturity from conceptual design -based estimates to baselined project estimates. The Los Alamos Plutonium Pit Production Project (LAP4) will support plutonium pit production at LANL. The LAP4 project replaces aging and outdated equipment with pit manufacturing equipment in the Plutonium Fac ility (PF -4) at LANL to increase throughput to no less than 30 pits per year (ppy). LAP4 achieved CD -2/3 for the Decontamination and Decommissioning subproject in the first quarter of FY 2022. Additionally, CD -3A and CD -3B were approved for long lead procurement of gloveboxes to support the 30 ppy base equipment installation subproject. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) project will maintain continuity in enduring analytical chemistry and materials characterization capabilities for DOE/NNSA actinide -based missions to support pit production and Plutonium Center of Excellence missions. Active subprojects include reconfiguring space in the Radiological Laboratory Utility Office Building and in PF-4, and installing additional analytical chemistry and materials characterization equipment. The Uranium Processing Facility (UPF)3 project will complete the Uranium Mission Strategy's first phase and ensure the long -term viability, safety, and security of D OE/NNSA's enriched uranium capability. It will provide a modernized capability to manufacture weapon subassemblies containing enriched uranium components and convert excess enriched uranium into forms suitable for safe, long -term storage and reuse. The n ew facility will support Y -12 National Security Complex's (Y -12) enriched uranium processing capabilities currently located in Building 9212, which is an original Manhattan Project -era facility that is degraded , is poorly configured to meet today's strateg ic needs , and poses multiple risks to meeting the mission. 3 The original baseline date for the Uranium Processing Facility CD -4 approval of December 2025 is under review.

The current facility that treats liquid waste is past its useful life and does not meet current codes and requirements. The Transuranic L iquid Waste Facility is designed to receive up to 29,000 liters of liquid waste annually from PF -4 operations, which produces pits for the Nation's enduring stockpile. The Technical Area 55 (TA -55) Reinvestments Project (Phase 3) has begun and supports des ign and construction for new fire alarm systems and removal of the old system in PF -4 at LANL . Due to the old system 's age, replacement parts are no longer readily available, adding risks to the program. The Savannah River Plutonium Processing Facility (S RPPF) will support plutonium pit production by repurposing the former Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) into a safe, secure, compliant, and efficient pit production facility. The former MFFF is a Security Category I/Hazard Category II4 structu re that provides an opportunity to achieve pit production in a facility designed to meet stringent security and safety requirements for plutonium operations. SRPPF will provide a sustained production capacity of no fewer than 50 War Reserve ppy as close t o 2030 as possible at Savannah River Site (SRS). The project achieved CD -1 in FY 2021. The High Explosives Synthesis, Formulation, and Production Facility (HESFP) project will establish HE production capability within the nuclear security enterprise to ad dress the current domestic supply's inability to meet DOE/NNSA production requirements. This project will consolidate limited legacy facilities that are inadequate for the mission need and will ensure the required capability and capacity is available to m eet the future HE workload and mission requirements. Areas to be addressed include explosive and mock formulation operations to support multiple weapon programs, technology development for future programs, and support for strategic partners. CD -1 was awa rded in February 2021 and plans for a CD -3A approval in FY 2024. The Lithium Processing Facility (LPF) will construct a new facility to replace Y -12 Building 9204 -2. At 79 years old , the current lithium facility is one of the oldest operating facilities in the nuclear security enterprise. Until the new LPF is operational and qualified, much of the risk to lithium sustainment is associated with the existing facilit y's age and degrada tion. A site for LPF has been 4 A Security Category I facility is one designed to contain certain quantities of strategic special nuclear materials that trig ger the most rigo rous level of security protections. Hazard Category II facilities are those for which a hazard analysis shows the potential for significant off -site consequences in the event of an accident. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-15 selected at Y -12 and t he former Biology Building was demolished to make room for this project. Lithium process design is 60 percent complete. Facility design and site civil exploratory boring activities , providing geotechni cal information in support of facility design, have commenced. The Tritium Finishing Facility (TFF) project will construct two new processing buildings and relocate the vulnerable reservoir -related capabilities from the current 65 -year -old facility to the newer, centralized facilities. This alternative will significantly reduce operational risk and increase facility reliability when compared to continuing operations in the current facility for an additional 20 years. The Weapon Material Processing and Manu facturing area has one line-item project in the Definition Phase of the CD process (CD -0 to CD -1): The Domestic Uranium Enrichment (DUE) project will analyze options for (and if necessary , establish) a reliable and economic supply of enriched uranium to su pport U.S. national security needs. The U.S. Government does not currently have the capability to enrich uranium. In addition to projects in the Definition and Execution Phases, DOE/NNSA is considering one programmatic line-item proposal in the Weapon Material Processing and Manufacturing area (Pre-CD-0). This project proposal is in the planning process but should not be considered a part of the program of record until it achieve s appropriate approvals . The description of scope should be considered illustrative, as alternative selection will not be made until the project completes an AoA and the project achieves CD -1: The Depleted Uranium Manufacturing Capability (DUMC) project w ould support several processes for creating binary feedstock and manufacturing components to meet component deliveries in support of weapons modernization programs. These processes include casting and alloy fabrication, pressing, forging, machining, and inspe ction. Updating the processing methods and right -sizing the facility for current and foreseeable production needs w ould result in a significant reduction in the footprint defined by the existing facilities. 4.2.1.5 Weapon Component Production Line-item projects i n the Weapon Component Production area support the research, design, development, qualification, surveillance, manufacturing and production for all non -nuclear components and systems for nuclear explosive package weaponization. Current planning estimates and schedule dates for projects in this area are listed in Figure 4-9. Figure 4-9. 25-year programmatic line -item schedule for ongoing and proposed projects related to Weapon Component Production Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-16 The Weapon Component Production area has one line-item project in the Definition Phase of the CD process (CD -0 to CD -1): The Power Sources Capability project will support all current and planned nuclear weapon systems that require power source research, development, design, qualification, production, and surveillance activities. Requirements for these power sources are stringent and unique to nuclear weapons, and very few commercial suppliers are viable for this work. The current facility cannot meet anticipated mission requirements due to increasing workload and poor facility condition, which poses increasing risks to meeting weapon program deliverabl es. DOE/NNSA also supplies advanced power sources for other national security mission needs that cannot be commercially sourced. This project will mitigate risk by establishing a new facility that is adaptable to changing needs, enables engagement with s upply chain partners, supports technology development, and fosters innovation. In addition to the project in the Definition Phase, DOE/NNSA is considering one programmatic line-item proposal in the Weapon Component Production area (Pre-CD-0). This project proposal is in the planning process but should not be considered part of the program of record until it achieve s appropriate approvals . The description of scope should be considered illustrative, as alternative selection will not be made until the projec t completes an AoA and the project achieves CD -1: The Sigma Replacement Facility project w ould construct new facilities to maintain and enhance capabilities for the many Stockpile Stewardship support roles that Sigma currently fulfills. These facilities would include the Integrated Technology Testbed for Advanced Manufacturing for developing transformative production technologies and three additional facilities that w ould support uranium foundry operations, replace LANL main shop capabilities for non -nucle ar components, and enable beryllium fabrication capability in a building with appropriate ventilation scaled to support the projected size of future mission need. 4.2.1.6 Weapon Assembly, Storage, Testing, and Disposition Line-item projects in the Weapon Assembly, Storage, Testing, and Disposition area support the safe and secure assembly, storage, testing, and disposition of weapon components. Current planning estimates and schedule dates for ongoing and proposed projects in this area are listed in Figure 4-10. Figure 4-10. 25-year programmatic line-item schedule for ongoing and proposed projects related to Weapon Assembly, Storage, Testing, and Disposition Two line-item s in the Weapon Assembly, Storage, Testing, and Disposition area are in the Definition Phase of the CD process (CD -0 to CD -1): The Material Staging Facility (MSF) at Pantex was placed on hold in April 2021. The project will provide a new safe, secure, and sustaina ble below -grade facility adjacent to Zone 12 South Material Access Area that meets weapon and special nuclear material (SNM) component staging Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-17 capacities for the next 75 to 100 years. The facility will house weapons, pits, SRS surplus plutonium material, as/if needed, and Hanford Unirradiated Fuel Packages. It will include shipping and receiving docks for SNM, and for transporting weapons in the Mobile Guardian Transporter and Safe Secure Transport. This project has been placed on hold so that NNSA can a ddress higher priorit y infrastructure projects . The Radiography/Assembly Capability Replacement (RACR) project will consolidate the existing assembly and radiography complex, consisting of over 17 World War II -era buildings. RACR will improve s afety, secu rity, schedules, and quality assurance, and decrease risk to the public, workers, and program. RACR will position the DOE/NNSA nuclear weapons program for nuclear explosive package assembly and radiography capability for the next 40 to 50 years for all si te and surveillance mission assignments. DOE/NNSA is considering two programmatic line -item proposals in the Weapon Assembly, Storage, Testing, and Disposition area (Pre -CD-0). These project proposals are in the planning process but should not be considered as part of the program of record until they achieve appropriate approvals . The descriptions of scope should be considered illustrative, as alternative selections will not be made until the projects complete an AoA and the project achieves CD -1: The Integrated Weapon Evaluation Capability (IWEC) project w ould consolidate testing facilities for a faster and more efficient testing process and improve NNSA's test development capability at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). Facility investment w ould provide secure high -bay, mid-bay, and light electrical laboratories; collaboration space; and general office space. This project would involve co -locating DOE/ NNSA's IWEC equipment. Commonality w ould reduce development cycle time and cost. The Weapon S ystem Assembly and Disassembly Cell Upgrade project w ould fill a throughput and capacity mission gap. By modernizing the infrastructure needed to improve production cell capacity, DOE/NNSA w ould be poised to support the anticipated workload increase durin g other infrastructure construction projects. 4.2.1.7 Transportation and Security Line-item projects in the Transportation and Security area support protecting all aspects that are critical to the nuclear security enterprise's function. The Secure Transportation capability within this area has no current or proposed line -item projects. The projects listed below support the Physical Security capability, which protects all nuclear materials, infrastructure assets, and the workforce at DOE/NNSA sites that are involv ed in Weapons Activities programs and operations. Current planning estimates and schedule dates for projects in this area are listed in Figure 4-11. Figure 4-11. 25-year programmatic line-item schedule for ongoing and proposed projects related to Transportation and Security Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-18 DOE/NNSA is currently executing one programmatic line -item construction project in the Transportation and Security area that is past CD -1. Cost and schedule estimates for t his project var y from conceptual design -based estimates to baselined project estimates: The West End Protected Area Reduction (WEPAR) project will reduce the size of the protected area at Y -12 from 150 acres to approximately 90 acres. This project will ha ve two beneficial outcomes. First, a new Perimeter Intrusion Detection and Assessment System will protect the sensitive facilities remaining within the now reduced perimeter, which will reduce security and operating costs. Second, DOE Environmental Manag ement cleanup activities for facilities previously encompassed by the larger protected area may proceed more efficiently and cost-effectively because those facilities will no longer be in a protected area. The project received CD-2/3 approval in January 2 021 and is anticipated to reach CD -4 in FY 202 5. In addition to the project in the Execution Phase, DOE/NNSA is considering one programmatic line -item proposal in the Transportation and Security area (Pre -CD-0). Th is project proposal is in the planning process but should not be considered a part of the program of record until it achieve s appropriate approvals . The description of scope should be considered illustrative, as alternative selection will not be made until the project completes an AoA and the pr oject achieves CD -1: The New Physical Security and Central Alarm Station ( CAS) Facility Replacement and Consolidation project would provide a new two-story facility that w ould house multiple security groups including the 24 /7 CAS. 4.2.2 Mission Enabling Construction DOE/NNSA also funds mission -enabling infrastructure line-item s that provide site -wide utilities, office and laboratory space, and other services that support the nuclear deterrence mission (see Figure 4-12). These projects are required to meet daily operational needs across the nuclear security enterprise. Three mission enabling line -item project s were recently completed : The Albuquerque Complex Project provided new offic e space and was constructed on DOE property in Albuquerque, adjacent to Kirtland Air Force Base. The current DOE/NNSA Albuquerque Office Complex is beyond its design life and does not meet DOE/NNSA's mission needs. Construction was completed on a 333,000 -square -foot building to house approximately 1,200 employees. The new building is designed to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED ) Gold Standards. The Technical Area 3 (TA -3) Substation Replacement at LANL provides increased distribution capacity, improved reliability, reduced maintenance, support for greater operational flexibility, and increased worker safety. It provides separate power feeds to LANL and Los Alamos County. The Emergency Operations Center at LLNL provides a new permanent Emergency Operations Center with comprehensive emergency management capabilities for the development, coordination, control, and direction of emergency planning, preparedness, readiness, assurance, response, and recovery actions. The 20,000 -square -foot building allow s an occupancy rate needed during an emergency event that the previous Emergency Operations Center could not accommodate, provide s additional parking, and contain s or interface s with approximately 60 systems, including closed -circuit television, metrology, site fire and life safety alarms, radio communication, emergency services disaster dispatching, etc. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-19 Figure 4-12. 25-year mission -enabling line -item schedule The Enhanced Minor Construction Commercial Standards pilot is a new initiative to increase buying power and accelerate delivery for non -complex, non -nuclear, commercial facilities line -item construction projects less than $50 million . The pilot aims to attract more competitive bidding and reduce project and cont ract management costs, while delivering a quality facility that meets the program requirements. There are currently three projects in the pilot , with a fourth, the Emergency Operations Center at LLNL, completed in March 2022. The Fire Station project at Y -12 provides a single -story building (approximately 35,000 square feet) to meet all emergency response requirements , including firefighting, emergency medical treatment and transport, hazardous materials spill mitigation, and technical rescue responses for all events within the site emergency response boundary at the Y -12 site. The new facility will be built to meet all safety standards and building codes to support 24 /7 operations under all environmental conditions. The facility will accommodate a workfo rce and a fleet that includes large fire apparatus vehicles, ambulances, emergency response vehicles, and other support vehicles. Construction began in FY 2021 and beneficial occupancy is planned for completion in FY 2023 . Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-20 The Emergency Operations Center at Y-12 will provide a centralized, comprehensive emergency management capability for the development, coordination, control, and direction of emergency planning, preparedness, readiness assurance, response, and recovery actions . The current facility is not compliant with DOE Order 151.1C, Comprehensive Emergency Management System . Construction began in FY 2021 and beneficial occupancy is planned for start of operations in FY 2023. The Emergency Operations Center at SNL will pr ovide a facility that supports DOE/NNSA and SNL emergency operations, the 24/7 Emergency Management Communication Center, dedicated incident management and coordination space, multipurpose training rooms, and fuel and water storage sufficient to mitigate a ll potential emergency operations and management response capabilities. The center is expected to be operational in spring 2023. Digital rendering of SNL's new Emergency Operations Center Construction at the Emergency Operations Center at Y -12 Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-21 The mission enabling projects listed below are following DOE O rder 413.3B CD process es and are currently in the Execution Phase. The 138kV Power Transmission System Replacement project will replace a 55 -year -old 138-kilovolt (kV) power transmission system in the NNSS Mission Corridor in Mercury, Nevada. The project will provide the site with reliable power and communications to mission -critical facilities by designing and constructing a new 138 -kV power transmission system to replace and upgrade 23 miles o f the degraded existing power transmission system. It will also upgrade the collocated fiber optic lines to meet vital national security mission requirements. The Plutonium Modernization Operations Complex at LANL will provide additional office workstatio ns and associated common space for increased operations within TA -55 and other supporting plutonium modernization capabilities in TA -46, 48, 50, and 63. The Digital Infrastructure Capability Expansion project at LLNL will provide safe, secure, resilient, reliable, flexible, and sustainable infrastructure for LLNL's networking and telecommunications digital infrastructure needs. The project will expand capabilities to meet growth projections for the next 40 years. The Electrical Power Capacity Upgrade at LA NL will address projected increases in the electrical transmission and distribution system's capacity at LANL to reliably support demand for multiple program activities being performed at the site. By 2024, power demand for all programs is expected to exc eed LANL's existing transmission and distribution system's capacity and performance requirements. This electrical upgrade will support critical Weapons Activities requirements for stockpile modernization programs, SFIs, ongoing stockpile stewardship progr ams, and other work. There are multiple proposals for new mission enabling projects that are planned over the next 10 to 25 years, including those listed below . With the exception of the Special Materials Facility, t he descriptions of scope should be considered illustrative, as alternative selections will not be made until the projects complete an AoA and the project achieves CD -1: The Special Materials Facility (SMF) Utilities and Infrastructure Sub-project will provide infrastructure and utility upgrades to Building 9225 -03 at Y -12. This repurposed facility is necessary to support special materials processing and production for future mission requirements. The Analytic Gas Laboratory at Pantex w ould provide the safe, secure, and reliable infrastructure necessary to perform gas analysis at Pantex. Gas analysis is required to perform the dismantlement, surveillance, stockpile refurbishment, and nuclear non -proliferation missions at Pantex. The Maintenance Facility at Y -12 w ould replace the antiquated maintenance facilities that support all Y -12 production missions and w ould enable preventive, predictive, and corrective maintenance across the site. The new facility would consolidate maintenance p rocesses and eliminate square footage of aging facilities in a more optimized, efficient location. The Office Space at Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC) w ould provide office space for additional staff supporting increased production capacity for planned requirements. Current facilities do not have the capacity to house the forecasted work force for the production of non-nuclear components for multiple programs. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-22 The National Security Innovation Center at LLNL w ould collocate staff in dispersed, end -of-life Weapons Program office buildings into a more centralized location and w ould enable optimized use of space. The Weapon Engineering Science and Technology Laboratory at SNL -California w ould integrate the Materials Science and Engine ering capabilities across materials development and engineering design. The primary existing facility is in poor condition, is functionally unfit for advanced materials science R&D, and lacks sufficient capacity to meet the current and projected demand. The Production Maintenance Facility at Pantex w ould replace multiple facilities approaching the end of operational life expectancy and not located near critical Production and Production Support facilities. The new facility w ould consolidate maintenance processes and provide a more efficient location to support Production operations and facilities. The Northwest Las Vegas New Office Space at NNSS would provide sustainable infrastructure that supports the health, safety, and welfare of NNSS employees, the public, and the environment. 4.3 Modernization and Sustainment This section describes how DOE/NNSA, in partnership with its M&O partners, modernizes and sustains assets to enable mission success and readiness ; ensures operational safety and security ; safeguar ds the workforce, public , and environment ; and meets mission needs to support the nuclear security mission. Modernization can be done through m inor cons truction and recapitalization projects , which are important vehicle s for DOE/NNSA to sustain major facilities and replace smaller capital assets below the $25 million minor construction threshold . These projects are an effective method for making improvem ents to increase DOE/NNSA's mission performance and lower operating costs. They typically can be completed much faster than line -item construction projects , and they enable DOE/NNSA to be responsive to emerging infrastructure issues and changing stockpile requirements. Modernizing the nuclear security enterprise is accomplished through formal recapitalization programs planned and funded at the DOE/NNSA level through General Plant Projects, Institutional General Plant Projects, and other funding mechanisms. These investments improve the condition, reliability, efficiency, and capability of infrastructure to meet mission requirements. The programs plan and execute replacement, installation, upgrades, and minor construction projects to revitalize existing facilities or construct new facilities and additions. This investment method is used in conjunction with line -item construction to provide timely, appropriately sized, and integrated infrastructure solutions. Security Infrastructure Revitalization Program (SIRP) SIRP was created by DOE/NNSA's Office of Defense Nuclear Security (DNS) to assure the strength of the physical security infrastructure supporting the DOE/NNSA mission. DNS developed and submitted to Congress a long -range Physical Security Systems Refresh Plan to outline and guide the scope of the SIRP effort. This plan contains a comprehensive condition assessment of the security infrastructure and a nuclear security prioritized listing of required upgrades. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-23 The fol lowing completed projects de monstrate that DOE/NNSA has directed infrastructure investments to address risks identified through facility and mission assessments: Building 235 Chemistry Laboratories and Facility Revitalizations at LLNL (Recapitalization) Crystal Lab Revitalization at LANL (Recapitalization) DARHT Weather Enclosure at LANL (Recapitalization) Building 23 Tenant Improvements at KCNSC (Recapitalization) Data Center at SNL (Recapitalization) Device Assembly Facility uninterruptible power supply Upgrade at NNSS (Recapitalization) Provided redundant power to Pantex Data Center under the 12 -37 Secondary Electrical Feed Installation project (Recapitalization) New Building 225 Manufacturing Science Facility at LLNL (Recapitalization) PF-4 High -Risk Variable Frequency Drive Fan Safety Replacement at LANL (Recapitalization) Installation of 7 Flame Dete ction System and 8 High Pressure Fire Loop lead -in replacements at Pantex (Recapitalization) New Z and TA -IV Missions Support Facility Building 972 at SNL (Recapitalization) TA-72 Outdoor Range Upgrades Project at LANL (Defense Nuclear Security [ DNS]) Range Classroom Facility Replacement at LLNL (D NS) Zone 12 Outdoor Floodlight Replacement at Pantex (D NS) Zone 12 and 4 Enterprise Standard Booth Installation at Pantex (DNS ) Building 224 Office Building at LLNL ( Site Directed Investments ) Building 223 Polymers and Engineering Facility at LLNL (Recapitalization) TA-33-0066 B uilding Extension at LANL (Site Directed Investments ) Building 9117 Data Center Upgrades at Y -12 (Site Directed Investments) Roof Asset Management Program (Recapitalization): 27 projects at NNSA sites/1 project at a DOE site NM HV 5kV Overhead Feeder Replacements for overhead powerlines in TA -III at SNL (Recapitalization) NM Water System Secondary F eed to the 700KG Tank at SNL (Recapitalization) New Z and TA -IV Missions Support Facility at SNL Crystal Lab Revitalization at LANL Data Center at SNL Installation of Flame Detection Sys tem and High - Pressure Fire Loop Lead -in Replacements at Pantex Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-24 234-H Main Side Diesel Generator Replacement at SRS (Recapitalization) Nuclear Facilities Electrical Modernization Portfolio at Y-12 (Recapitalization and Maintenance ) DOE/NNSA is also modernizing its infrastructure by executing its first option to purchase acquisition at 103 Palladium Way to house Y -12's development capab ilities. An option agreement is a contract with the land/facility owner that gives a prospective buyer the exclusive right to purchase the property at a fixed price within a stated time period. The option agreement allows necessary time for DOE/NNSA to p erform the due diligence required for any Federally funded purchase. This existing off -site facility , known as the John M. Googin Tech Development Facility , is near Y -12 and will provide a timely and cost-effective home for Y -12's development mission. Th e facility is located on a secure and fenced 21 -acre level campus with approximately 73,000 square feet of interior space. The building has extensive high -bay areas, wet-chemical laboratory areas, office areas, and already has the utilities necessary for a duplicate facility (100,000 square foot expansion) on the adjacent grounds. It was originally built as a secure facility to make medical isotopes in 1999 but was never occupied. With relatively little renovation, the facility can easily be adapted to house the compatibility and surveillance, materials processing, mechanical, control and sensor systems, and the metallurgical engineering and processing operations of Y -12 development. It is anticipated the building will provide a clean, safe, and modern facility for development that w ill assist in the recruitment and retention of the talented scientific and engineering staff that Y -12 requires for future success if this st rategy is pursued. Sustainment activities include maintenance and repair activities to sustain an acceptable condition of real property assets to perform their designated purpose or to mitigate risks. In some instances, the nature of core mission areas le ads to direct programmatic sustainment funding for certain operations. These efforts support the recurring daily work needed to sustain plant, property, assets, systems, roads, and equipment in a condition suitable for its designated purpose. Efforts inc lude required maintenance through surveillance and predictive, preventive, and corrective maintenance activities to maintain facilities, property, assets, systems, roads, equipment, and vital safety systems. These sustainment activities are executed throug h a combination of innovative tools that provide data for risk analyses that inform infrastructure management decisions. Decisions dedicate critical resources to maintaining facilities already in good condition and repairing the highest risks in DOE/NNSA assets . 4.4 Disposition DOE/NNSA infrastructure that is no longer needed must be dispositioned to minimize risks to workers, the public, the environment, and the mission. Approximately 9 percent of assets located on DOE/NNSA's sites are designated as excess. DOE/NNSA's highest disposition priorities are to stabilize degraded facilities, characterize hazards and conditions, remove hazardous and flammable materials, and place facilities in the lowest acceptable risk condition possible until they can be Nuclear Facilities Electrical Modernization Portfolio at Y -12 Main Side Diesel Generator Replacement at SRS Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administra tion | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 4-25 disposi tioned. If a facilit y is process -contaminated , and the cost estimate for disposing of the facility exceeds $75 million, then DOE/NNSA must stabilize the facility until the DOE Office of Environmental Management can perform the disposition . The DOE/NNSA D isposition Strategic Plan outlines the details of how DOE/NNSA plans to address these excess facilities. Several completed projects demonstrate that DOE/NNSA has directed infrastructure investments to address risks identified through facility and mission assessments : Building 292 Deinventory at LLNL (Disposition) Ion Beam Equipment Removal at LANL (Disposition) Buildings 11 -015A, 12 -006B, 12 -045, -47 at Y -12 (Disposition ) The longer an unused facility is left standing before demolition, the more deteriorated it becomes, and the more difficult it is to maintain in a safe shutdown condition. Aging facilities pose risks to human health, the environment, and the mission . DOE/ NNSA is committed to mitigating these risks by dispositioning excess facilities as quickly as possible and working with the DOE Office of Environmental Management when its expertise is required. During the next 10 years, nearly 700 additional assets with 4.2 million gross square feet are planned to become excess at DOE/ NNSA sites. Of these assets, approximately 43 percent are process contaminated and may require DOE Office of Environmental Management expertise to demolish. Building 11 -015A at Pantex Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Ye ar 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-1 Chapter 5 Budget and Fiscal Estimates The Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 President's Budget for Weapons Activities supports the nuclear stockpile and associated modernization programs. T he FY 2023 President's Budget provides increase of 8.5 percent1 for the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/ NNSA) and an increase of 7.4 percent for Weapons Activities above the FY 2021 enacted appropriation. Throughout this chapter , the FY 2023 budget request is compared to the FY 2021 enacted budget to maintain consistency with the FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justifications. The FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justifications were prepared under a continuing resolution, prior to the enactment of the FY 2022 budget . DOE/NNSA developed the FY 2023 Future Years Nuclear Security Program (FYNSP) budget request for Weapons Activities by evaluating the resources necessary to support priority requirements and align ed warhead programs to DOE/NNSA requirements. The assumpt ions encompassed by this request meet the timeline for DOE/NNSA's warhead deliveries to be synchronized with the modernization of Department of Defense ( DoD ) delivery platforms. The first part of this chapter displays budgetary information for the FY 2023 budget request based on the program of record described in the previous chapters of this Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary (FY 2023 SSMP). Sections 5.4 through 5.8 compare the FY 2023 budget request to the FY 2021 enacted budget by program/budget line and present key milestones , showing progress toward program goals. Key milestones beyond the next 5 years show planned activities to meet DoD requirements and are contingent on future decisions. The second part of the chapter describes cost projections for selected programs beyond FY 2023, including the basis of those cost projections used to estimate the potential long -term cost of the DOE/NNSA Weapons Activities program. Cost -estimating techniq ues supporting the budget request are consistent with Government Accountability Office (GAO) best practices and have been updated with current requirements for each weapon system. The chapter concludes with an overview of the 25-year plan and an analysis of the affordability of the Weapons Activities program. 5.1 Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Evaluation DOE/NNSA employs a Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Evaluation (PPBE) process similar to processes in use across the U.S. Government. DOE/NNSA's PPBE process has four major phases for each budget cycle: The Planning phase of the PPBE process considers the range of work in a manner that is fiscally informed, but not constrained, to ensure all requirements and mission needs are considered. This phase is guided by strategic goals and objectives specified in Department -level and NNSA -level strategic planning documents. These internal strategic documents are align ed with , and support , the mission priorities in the National Security Strategy , National Defense Strategy , and Nuclear Posture Review . Internal documents are also developed in consultation with the program offices 1The percent change does not reflect the mandated transfer of $91.0 million in FY 2021 from Naval Reactors to the Office of Nuclear Energy for operations of the Advanced Test Reactor . Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-2 and management and operating (M&O) contractor partner s to ensure they reflect a complete set of requirements . This analysis drive s the development of a budget that allows timely execution of key mission priorities and enables DOE/ NNSA to achieve its mission. The Programming phase is the decision -making process that aligns available program resources with priorities , resulting in a balanced, integrated, executable FYNSP to be proposed by DOE to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as the basis for that year's congressional budget request. This phase is primarily a Headquarters -driven process that allocates resou rces and integrates the funded activities to ensure accomplishment of the highest priority efforts. The Budgeting phase involves the production of a formal budget request and associated justifications to OMB and to Congress as well as execution of appropr iated funds. DOE/NNSA develops OMB budget justification materials for the FYNSP that state work scopes and schedules corresponding with the funding request. Budgeting includes formulation, justification, execution, and control of the budget . This proces s describes to Co ngress the resources necessary to execute the mission and then ensure s DOE/NNSA spend s those resources in accordance with the law. Budget Formulation is the development of fund ing estimates that support the plans and programs and obtains resources for program execution. Budget Justification includes the development of the budget and supporting documentation that allows the stakeholder to understand the program , or function , and the resources required to accomplish the effort. Budget exec ution is the phase in which appropriated resources are distributed and controlled to achieve their approved purpose. The OMB apportionment process makes funds available to DOE for obligation and expenditure. Appropriation legislation and accompanying tab les are the controlling documents for funds distribution and display the budgetary resources available. Execution is the consistent monitoring of expenditures and obligations. Evaluation is the assessment of progress made toward achieving identified perfo rmance measures at multiple levels within DOE/NNSA. At any time, multiple PPBE phases for different budget cycles are ongoing concurrently . 5.2 Portfolio Management DOE/ NNSA employs portfolios which are aligned with the budget , but are scope -based , to optimize its risk-informed, complex, and time -constrained modernization and recapitalization effort s. The President's Budget for Weapons Activities funds a set of programs based on analysis of what actions are necessary to accompl ish DOE/NNSA's statutory mission to manage the current and future stockpile without nuclear explosive testing. DOE/NNSA uses a rigorous portfolio management approach to determine the right set of programs and projects to accomplish that mission . During t he programming process, funding levels are established at various levels of detail for the FYNSP period to align anticipated resources with DOE/NNSA priorities . Portfolio management enables DOE/NNSA to make necessary invest ments to advance existing capabilities and develop emerging capabilities for a strong nuclear deterrent. These capabilities underpin each of the Weapons Activities portfolio s and are described in Chapter 3 . 5.3 FY 2023 Future Years Nuclear Security Program Weapons Activities provides maintenance and refurbishment of nuclear weapons to sustain confidence in their safety, reliability, and military effectiveness . In addition, Weapons Activities invests in scientific and engineering capabilities for assessment of the current sto ckpile warheads, qualification of Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-3 components for warhead modernization, and certification of warheads upon entry into the stockpile . Weapons Activities also provides maintenance and investment in DOE/NNSA's infrastructure. The FY 2023 FYNSP budget reque st supports the current stockpile, warhead modernization activities , recapitalization and modernization programs for infrastructure , and reestablishment of necessary production capabilities. It also supports research and development ( R&D ) effort s and pers onnel growth in operations, physical security, and information technology (IT) and cyber security to support expanding program needs . In previous years, line -item construction projects were consolidated under the Infrastructure and Operations program. Ho wever, programmatic line -items in the FY 2023 FYNSP now reside under their respective program lines to reflect the Weapons Activities account integrator's request for greater transparency with major construction projects . Table 5-1 displays the FY 2021 and FY 2022 enacted budgets, and the program budget requests for Weapons Activities for FY 2023-FY 2027. The structure of the budget request in Table 5 -1 reflects the major programs, not the capabilities discussed previously in Chapter 3. The figures and narrative that follow describe the FY 2023 budget request in more detail. Table 5 -1.

The budget request for Stockpile Sustainment increased to support : The W76 Mk4B development and qualification Design, development, qualification, and production of weapon surety capabilities Implementation of Integrated Surety Architecture Development and deployment of product realization and digital engineering tools and applications Transition of t he B61 -12 into stockpile Joint Test Assembly flight test vehicle development and production High explosive component development and production Special material procurement supporting limited life components Activities supporting Air Force transition from Minuteman III to the LGM -35A Sentinel , previously referred to as the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent 5.4.2.3 Weapon s Dismantlement and Disposition Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition dismantles retired weapons and dispositions retired components from the stockpile . It also provides safety studies on retired systems and technical analysis needed to dismantle , and safely store , weapons being removed from the stockpile . It p rovides an integrated program to safely dismantle and dispose of warhead components that have been retired, while some limited number of components from the dismantled warheads are preserved for potential reuse in stockpile modernization and safety testing programs. The budget request for Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition decreased due to a reduction in disposition of legacy component inventories . 5.4.2.4 Production Operations Production Operations is a multi -weapon system manufacturing -based program that drives individual site production capabilities and capacity for the stockpile sustainment and modernization programs, including limited life component production and weapon assembly and disassembly operations . Production Operations also provides programmatic equipment maintenance, and maintenance/calibration services for manufactur ing operations to meet D oD War Reserve requirements . The budget request for Production Operations increased to support : Programmatic equipment maintenance activities previously funded under Infrastructure and Operations Kansas City National Security Camp us (KCNSC ) expansion and equipment relocation Hiring of critical skilled labor resources to support increase in production activities 5.4.2.5 Nuclear Enterprise Assurance The FY 2023 budget request provides fund ing for this new subprogram, which actively manages adversarial subversion risks to nuclear weapons and associated design, production, and testing Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-6 capabilities. NEA enables the responsible use of digital technologies in the modernization of weapons, facilities, and engineering capabilities by preventing, detecting, and mitigating potential consequences of subversion. Through nuclear weapon digital assurance, NEA enables risk -managed adoption of leading - edge technologies to meet emerging military requirements and to reduce modernization schedules and costs. 5.4.3 Key Milestones DOE/NNSA must meet the key Stockpile Management milestones in Figure 5-22 to sustain and modernize the stockpile . There is one m ajor change from last year's plan related to Stockpile Management : The FY 2022 milestone , Begin Phase 6.4 activities for the W80 -4 LEP, is delayed to FY 2023 . DOE/NNSA is re -evaluating the W80 -4 LEP schedule due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19), staffing, and technical program delays. Entry into Phase 6.4 will occur after the re-scheduled milestones are completed. The FY 2025 milestone, Deliver first production unit of the W80 -4 LEP , was shifted to FY 2027 due to COVID -19 impacts, slow ramp -up in staff, and component technical delays. Due to the curren t margin between NNSA first production unit and Air Force Initial Operational Capability, NNSA has high confidence that it will support the Air Force's scheduled Long Range Standoff cruise missile initial and final operational capability dates. One m ilesto ne from last year's Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan (SSMP ) completed in FY 2022 is: Deliver first production unit of the B61 -12 LEP Figure 5 -2. Key milestones for Stockpile Management 5.5 Production Modernization The Production Modernization program is responsible for modernizing the facilities, infrastructure, and equipment that produce materials and components to meet stockpile requirements and maintain the Nation's nuclear deterrent. It consists of five major subprograms that sustain the Nation's nuc lear weapons stockpile : (1) Primary Capability Modernization , (2) Secondary Capability Modernization , (3) Tritium Modernization and Domestic Uranium Enrichment , (4) Non -Nuclear Capability Modernization , 2 These key milestones do not include key annual deliverables, such as completing the Annu al Assessment Process culminating in the national security laboratory (Los Alamos National Laboratory [LANL] , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [LLNL] , and Sandia National Laboratories [SNL] ) Directors' letters to the Secretaries of Energy and Defense by the end of each fiscal year; meeting Surveillance Program requirements as approved via the surveillance governance model; and updating system reliability estimates and issuing a Weapons Reliability Report. Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-7 and (5) Capability Based Investments (CBI) . CBI was funded under Infrastructure and Operations in prior year budget requests and now resides within Production Modernization . 5.5.1 Budget The budget request for Production Modernization increased 18.9 percent from the FY 2021 enacted budget (comparable structure) and is illustrated in Figure 5 -3. Figure 5 -3. FY 2023 President's Budget Request for Production Modernization 5.5.2 FY 2023 Budget Request Compared to FY 2021 Enacted Budget 5.5.2.1 Primary Capability Modernization Primary Capability Modernization consolidates management of primary stage material processing and component production capabilities in the nuclear security enterprise . The program includes (1) Plutonium Modernization and (2) High Explosives and Energetics (HE&E) Modernizati on. The Los Alamos Plutonium Pit Production Project (LAP4) , the Technical Area 55 (TA-55) Reinvestment Project - Phase 3, Transuranic Liquid Waste Facility , Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement , and the Savannah River Plutonium Processing Facility (SRPPF) are now included under Primary Capability Modernization to Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-8 encompass the full scope of Plutonium Modernization. The HE&E program includes the Energetic Materials Characterization project , the High Explosives ( HE) Synthesis, For mulation, and Production project , and the HE Science and Engineering project. As with Plutonium Modernization, these line -item construction projects were captured under Infrastructure and Operations in previous years. The budget request for the Primary C apability Modernization program increased to support : Activities associated with Los Alamos Plutonium Operations , LAP4, and SRPPF HE&E modernization through establishing HE production capability at the Naval Surface Warfare Center - Indian Head Division , preliminary design for the Energetic Materials Characterization project, and final design and start of construction for HE Synthesis, Formulation, and Production 5.5.2.2 Secondary Capability Modernization Secondary Capability Modernization restores and increases manufacturing capabilities for the secondary stage of nuclear weapons in the nuclear security enterprise . This modernization includes ensuring the availability of strategic materials and other sub -component streams necessary for the secondary st age, as well as modernizing the facilities and operations required to process these materials, fabricate them into parts, and assemble the final components. The program includes three subprograms: (1) Uranium Modernization (formerly Uranium Sustainment) , (2) Depleted Uranium Modernization , and (3) Lithium Modernization . The Lithium Processing Facility and Uranium Processing Facility projects are now captured within the Secondary Capability Modernization program instead of Infrastructure and Operations . The overall decrease in the budget request for Secondary Capability Modernization reflect s the transition from peak construction activities for the Uranium Processing Facility ; however, the budget request for Depleted Uranium Modernization and Lithium Modernization increased to support: Re-establishing a reliable supply of High Purity D epleted Uranium metal and investing in key new technologies to modernize production and meet future demands , includ ing moderniz ing the historical wrought process and investing in critical foundry modernization projects Fully fund ing minor construction projects supporting Lithium Modernization such as the Lithium Lab Area Upgrades, Backup Crusher/Grinder project , and the Lithium Pr ocess Equipment Relocation risk reduction activity 5.5.2.3 Tritium Modernization and Domestic Uranium Enrichment Tritium Modernization and Domestic Uranium Enrichment (DUE) consist of two parts : (1) Tritium Modernization , which produces, recovers, and recycles tri tium to support national security requirements , and (2) the DUE Program , which is responsible for provid ing unobligated, low -enriched uranium for tritium production , and preserv ing and advanc ing uranium enrichment technology for potential future deployment to meet national security needs . The Tritium Finishing Facility line-item project now resides within this program and no longer falls under Infrastructure and Operations. The budget requests f or Tritium Modernization and Domestic Uranium Enrichment increased to support: Increas ing irradiation of tritium -producing burnable absorber rods ( TPBAR ) to meet multi -year plans for producing tritium, consistent with sustaining a reliable, flexible, and r esilient supply chain to meet National Security requirements Licensing Tennessee Valley Authority reactors beyond 1,792 TPBARs and Spent Fuel Pool Rerack Replacing Hot and Cold Nitrogen and Thermal Cycling Absorption Process equipment at the Savannah Rive r Site (SRS) Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-9 Completing final design activities and the Site Preparation and Warehouse subproject for the Tritium Finishing Facility project Down -blending highly enriched uranium (HEU) to extend future tritium need dates , which had previously been funded in a separate HEU d own -blend line and is now included in the DUE line Increas ing centrifuge development scope and maturity as the DUE program advances towards larger -scale R&D demonstrations 5.5.2.4 Non -Nuclear Capability Moderni zation Non -Nuclear Capability Modernization consolidates management and oversight of strategic investments to modernize capabilities for design, qualification, and production of non -nuclear components for multiple weapon systems. This program provides inc reased capability and capacity to produce , and qualify , non-nuclear components to meet scheduled stockpile sustainment and weapon modernization programs . In addition, this program enables development of strategies, processes , and new capabilities and purc hasing programmatic equipment for production of non -nuclear components. The Power Sources Capability line -item is now captured within this program instead of Infrastructure and Operations. The budget request for this program increased to support : The transfer of scope for Accelerator and Major Environmental Test Facility programmatic equipment maintenance requirements from I nfrastructure and Operations Additional support for required qualification and testing capabilities, including modernization efforts for the radiation testing facility Annular Core Research Reactor at Sandia National Laboratories ( SNL) Tester Transformation Initiative aimed at improv ing tester requirements by establishing a means for pre -qualifying testers to a common design agency -production agency platform and ensur ing designs and hardware meet requirements Direct funding for At -Risk Materials, an enterprise -wide effort for early identification of at -risk materials and development of solutions to avoid supply chain interruptions 5.5.2.5 Capability Based Investments The CBI program executes projects to replace , or enhance , core enterprise capabilities through recapitalization of high risk of failure test, measurement, and production equipment. CBI addresses enduring, multi -program requirem ents through discrete, short -duration projects. These investments recapitalize scientific and manufacturing capabilities that have degraded due to aging, broken, or outdated equipment and supporting systems. CBI activities primarily include capital equipment purchases and minor construction projects that ensure needed capabilities are available for stockpile stewardship, sustainment, and modernization. The budget request for this program increased to support the expansion of the Flexible Production Capacity Initiative . 5.5.3 Key Milestones DOE/NNSA must invest in re -establishing production capabilities and modernizing programmatic infrastructure to properly support the current and future nuclear deterrent mission. Although programmatic construction projects shifted from Infrastructure and Operations to the relevant programs in the FY 2023 budget request, in previous SSMPs, key infrastructure milestones were included in the Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-10 relevant program areas, so there is no sign ificant change to the milestone sections because of this shift . Key milestones for Production Modernization are presented by program in Sections 5.5.3.1-5.5.3.5. 5.5.3.1 Primary Capability Modernization Key milestones for Primary Capability Modernization are in Figure 5-4. Major change s from last year's plan related to Primary Capability Modernization are: The FY 2022 milestone, Obtain Critical Decision (CD) --1 for Energetic Materials Characterization, is delayed to FY 2023 to align the project's post -CD-1 activities with appropriated project funding available beginning in FY 2023. The FY 2032 to FY 2035 milestone, Achieve 80 pits per year (ppy) production capability as close to 2030 as possible, is now shown as Obtain CD -4, Approve Start of Operations or Project Completion, for SRPPF to provide clarification that following the start of operations at SRPPF (CD-4 approval), SRPPF will then ramp up to projected pit production capability. The FY 2026 milestone, Obtain CD -4 for High Explosives Science and Engineering , is delayed to FY 2027 due to a termination of the early works subcontractor, requirement to replan remaining scope, and a delay in awarding the main works construction contract . The FY 2028 milestone, Obtain CD -4 for Energetic Materials Characterization, is shifted to FY 2030 due to a higher fidelity schedule estimate as a result of additional design and scheduling analysis required prior to CD -1, Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range . The FY 2028 milestone, Obtain CD -4 for CMRR, is delayed to FY 2029 to prioritize LAP4 and major item of equipment projects within the Plutonium Facility . One milestone from last year's SSMP is no longer included as a milestone : Complete construction of the Energetic s Manufacturing Science and Technology Project Figure 5 -4.

The Combined Radiation Environments for Survivability Testing (CREST) line-item proje ct now resides within this program instead of Infrastructure and Operations. The budget request for Engineering and Integrated Assessments increased to support : Conceptual design costs for CREST \u2014the increased funding for CREST is partially offset by shift ing resources from all Engineering and Integrated Assessments ' programs to support higher priority NNSA efforts . Studies and Assessments to support pre -Phase X/6.X studies , which focus on the conduct and management of refurbishment activities of existing w eapons per the Phase 6.X guidelines, in addition to feasibility assessments of future nuclear weapon stockpile requirements . 5.6.2.3 Inertial Confinement Fusion ICF provides high energy density (HED) science capabilities and expertise that support research and testing across the breadth of stockpile stewardship . Its two -fold mission is to meet immediate , and emerging , HED science needs to support the deterrent of today and to advance the R&D capabilities necessary to meet those needs for the deterrent of the future. The program includes three subprograms: (1) HED and Ignition Science for Stockpile Applications , (2) ICF Diagnostics and Instrumentation , and (3) Facility Operati ons. The budget request for ICF decreased to use available carryover while prioritiz ing support for maturing experimental platforms to execute HED experiments critical to supporting stockpile needs . 5.6.2.4 Advanced Simulation and Computing ASC provides high -end s imulation capabilities (e.g. , modeling codes, computing platforms, and supporting infrastructure) to meet stockpile stewardship requirements . ASC provides the weapon codes that provide the integrated assessment capability supporting annual assessment , future sustainment program qualification and certification of warheads on entry into the stockpile. The program includes six subprograms: (1) Integrated Codes , (2) Physics and Engineering Models , (3) Verification and Validation , (4) Advanced Technology Development and Mitigation , (5) Computational Systems and Software Environment , and (6) Facility Operations and User Support. The Exascale Computing Facility Modernization line -item project now falls within the ASC program instead of Infrastruc ture and Operations. The overall decrease in the budget request for ASC is due to Exascale Computing Facility Modernization project completion , while funding for the rest of ASC increased slightly . 5.6.2.5 Weapon Technology and Manufacturing Maturation Weapon s Technology and Manufacturing Maturation is responsible for developing agile, affordable, assured, and responsive technologies and capabilities for nuclear stockpile sustainment and modernization to enable the future success of the nuclear security enterprise . It is comprised of three subprograms: (1) Surety Technologies , (2) Weapon Technology Development , and (3) Advanced Manufacturing Development. Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-16 The budget request for Weapons Technology and Manufacturing Maturation decreased due to : The transfer of quali ty assurance scope and funding from Weapon Technology Development to the Stockpile Management/ Production Operations The transfer of direct cast scope and funding from Advanced Manufacturing Development to the Secondary Capability Modernization program within the Office of Production Modernization The shift of resources from the three Weapon Technology and Manufacturing Maturation programs to support higher priority DOE/ NNSA efforts 5.6.2.6 Academic Programs Academic Programs support investments in science and engineering disciplines critical ly importan t to the nuclear security enterprise . Funding provided for the program's grants, research centers of excellence , fellowships, and other activities offer s individuals an introduction to the mission and people of the national laboratories and help s establish a workforce pipeline to strengthen the future enterprise . Academic Programs includes five subprograms: (1) Stewardship Science Academic Alliance , (2) Minority Serving Institution Partnership Program , (3) Join t Program in High Energy Density Laboratory Plasmas , (4) Computational Science Graduate Fellowships , and (5) Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program . The slight decrease in the budget request for Academic Programs reflect s reprioritization of Stewardship Science Academic Alliance, while supporting existing awards until completion . 5.6.3 Key Milestones The Stewardship Capability Delivery Schedule is used to align SRT&E programs with mission objectives, coordinate efforts across Defense Programs , and communicate with internal and external stakeholders . Other high -level planning activities, such as the National Plutonium Aging Science Plan, serve as vehicles for coordinating work in specific areas of mission need. Key milestones for SRT&E are illustrated in Figure 5-9. Major ch anges from last year's plan are: The FY 2022 milestone, Accept ATS -3/Crossroads Phase 1 computing platform, is shifted to FY 2023 due to supply chain challenges, as well as application and software issues. The FY 2023 milestone, Accept ATS -4/El Capitan exascale computing platform, is now correctly shown in FY 2024 and was previously published in error. The FY 2023 milestone, Complete Advanced Sources and Detectors (ASD) accelerator injector testing at the i ntegrated test stand , is delayed to FY 2026 due to COVID -19 and supply chain issues associated with delivery of materials. ASD was in the design phase during COVID -19, which caused delays as designers could not come to laboratories to work using CAD machi nes, and many parts ordered for prototyping were delayed due to vendor staffing. The FY 2025 milestone, Obtain CD -4 for ASD -Scorpius , is delayed to FY 2027 due to COVID -19 and supply chain issues associated with delivery of materials. The FY 2024 milestone , Execute Excalibur Experiment (ECSE reactivity) , delayed to FY 2025 due to an updated subcritical experiments (SCE) schedule. The FY 2025 milestone, Complete Red Sage & Nimble subcritical experiment campaigns , is delayed to FY 2026 due to an updated SC E schedule. The FY 2026 milestone, Execute Sherman Experiment (ECSE plutonium radiograph) , is delayed to FY 2028 due to an updated SCE schedule. Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-17 Three milestone s from last year's SSMP were completed in FY 2022: Complete construction of Exascale Computing Facility Modernization Obtain CD -2/3 for ASD -Scorpius Qualify and deploy a new scintillator for Confined Large Optical Scintillator Screen and Imaging System (CoLOSSIS) I and II Figure 5 -9. Key milestones for Stockpile Research, Technology, and Engineering 5.7 Infrastru cture and Operations Infrastructure and Operations maintains, operates, and modernizes DOE/NNSA's infrastructure in a safe, secure, and cost -effective manner to support all DOE/NNSA programs . Infrastructure and Operations takes a comprehensive approach to modernizing DOE/ NNSA 's infrastructure while maximizing return on investment, enabling program results, and reducing enterprise risk. The program also plans, prioritizes, and constructs mission -enabling facilities and infrastru cture. Infrastructure and Operations includes (1) Operations of Facilities , (2) Safety and Environmental Operations , (3) Maintenance and Repair of Facilities , (4) Recapitalization , and (5) Line-Item Construction. Capabili ties Based Investments, previousl y under Recapitalization, now resides under Production Modernization, and programmatic construction projects have shifted to their relevant programs . Additional information about Infrastructure and Operations can be found in Chapter 4, \"Infrastructure and Operations.\" 5.7.1 Budget The budget request for Infrastructure and Operations increased 3.5 percent from the FY 2021 enacted budget (comparable structure) and is illustrated in Figure 5-10. Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-18 Figure 5 -10. FY 2023 President's Budget Request for Infrastructure and Operations 5.7.2 FY 2023 Budget Request Compared to FY 2021 Enacted Budget 5.7.2.1 Operations of Facilities Operations of Facilities provides the funding required to operate DOE/ NNSA facilities in a safe and secure manner and is fundamental to achieving DOE/ NNSA's pluto nium, uranium, tritium, lithium, HE, and other mission objectives. This program includes essential support , such as water and electrical utilities , safety systems , lease agreements , and activities associated with Federal, state, and local environmental, w orker safety, and health regulations. The budget request for Operations of Facilities increased to support : The Plutonium Modernization mission, including the production of at least 30 p py at Los Alamos National Laboratory ( LANL ) Operations support personnel to complete 100 percent of SRS mission deliverables, including LEP requirements and gas transfer system surveillance requirements per schedule Increased safety basis needs at the Pantex Plant (Pantex) Note: The increase is partially offset by a t ransfer of scope for programmatic equipment maintenance at SNL to the Production Operations program. Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-19 5.7.2.2 Safety and Environmental Operations Safety and Environmental Operations provides DOE's Nuclear Criticality Safety Program, Nuclear Safety Research and De velopment, Packaging subprogram, Long Term Stewardship subprogram , and Nuclear Materials Integration subprogram. These activities support safe, efficient operation of the nuclear security enterprise by provid ing safety data, nuclear material packaging, en vironmental monitoring, and nuclear material tracking. The decrease to the budget request for Safety and Environmental Operations reflects a small adjustment to reduce uncosted balances . This is offset by an increase for additional support for the Material Managers at the sites under the Nuclear Materials Integration Program. 5.7.2.3 Maintenance and Repair of Facilities Maintenance and Repair of Facilities provides direct -funded maintenance activ ities across the nuclear security enterprise for the recurring daily work required to sustain and preserve DOE/ NNSA facilities and facility -related equipment in a condition suitable for their designated purpose. These efforts include predictive, preventiv e, and corrective maintenance activities to maintain facilities, property, assets, systems, roads, and vital safety systems. The budget request for Maintenance and Repair of Facilities increased to support : The Plutonium Modernization mission, including th e production of at least 30 p py at LANL Increased maintenance needs at SNL to support the Microsystems Engineering, Science , and Applications Extended Life Program Transfer of the Waste Solidification Building at SRS from the Material Management and Minimization's Material Disposition subprogram within Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Note: The increase is partially offset by a transfer of scope for programmatic equipment maintenance at KCNSC to the Production Operations program. 5.7.2.4 Recapitalization Recapitalization modernizes DOE/NNSA's infrastructure by prioritizing investments to improve the condition and extend the life of structures, capabilities, a nd systems, thereby improving the safety and quality of the workplace. Funding is used to address numerous obsolete support and safety systems , revitalize facilities that are beyond the end of their design life , address climate adaptability and resilience , and improve the reliability, efficiency, and capability of infrastructure to meet mission requirements. Recapitalization investments help achieve operational efficiencies and reduce safety, security, environmental, and program risk. The Recapitalizatio n program includes minor construction projects, real property purchases, planning, other project costs for Infrastructure and Operations -funded mission enabling infrastructure, and deactivation and disposal of excess infrastructure. The decrease of the budget request for Recapitalization reflects a realignment to Mission Enabling Construction to address modernizing larger projects . 5.7.2.5 Line -Item Construction Construction is critical in revitalizing the nuclear security enterprise . These projects will replace obsolete, unreliable facilities and infrastructure to reduce safety and program risk while improving responsiveness, capacity, and capabilities. NNSA uses a prioritization methodology for mission enabling line -item construction that evaluates inve stments on closing mission gaps, reducing infrastructure risk and safety risk, improving sustainability, and reducing deferred maintenance. Programmatic construction no longer falls under this subprogram , and instead w as shift ed to the respective programs . Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-20 The budget request for Mission Enabling Construction includes funding in FY 2023 for: Design for t he Electrical Power Capacity Upgrade at LANL Plutonium Modernization Operations and Waste Management Office Building at LANL Construction for the Special Materials Facility at the Y-12 National Security Campus (Y -12) The transition to construction for the Digital Infrastructure Capability Expansion project at LLNL Additional information on planned line -item investments can be found in Chapter 4, \"Infrastructure and Operations.\" 5.7.3 Key Milestones Key milestones for Programmatic Construction are shown in the relevant program sections within this chapter , as program mission execution often depe nds on completion of line -item projects. Schedule s for the highest priority Programmatic and Mission Enabling project proposal s are displayed in Chapter 4, Figures 4-5 through 4 -12. Projects proposed within the FYNSP have higher -fidelity estimates , and some planned projects in the out -years may decide to use alternative strategies other than a line -item project once each respective Analysis of Alternatives ( AoA) is completed. Per the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 , DOE/NNSA estab lished the Infrastructure Modernization Initiative (IMI) program . Per the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 , Congress amended the IMI to require reducing deferred maintenance (DM) per replacement plant value (RPV) by not less than 45 percent by 2030. The IMI will be carried out by infrastructure r ecapitalization , maintenance and repair of facilities , and construction programs. The initial plan was transmitted to Congress in September 2018 and an updated plan was delivered in October 2022 . 5.7.4 Infrastructure Maintenance and Recapitalization Investments As part of the IMI, DOE/NNSA is using BUILDER, a system developed by the Army Corp s of Engineers and recognized by the National Academy of Sciences as a best -in-class practice for infrastru cture management. The BUILDER system uses comprehensive inventory, life cycle, cost, and assessment data and risk -informed standards and policies to recommend repairs , and replacements , at the most opportune time, thus improving DOE/ NNSA's ability to pinpoint and prioritize investments. Historical approaches greatly underestimated the RPV of DOE/ NNSA's facilities. As shown in Table 5-2, DOE/ NNSA's new calculated RPV is $ 124.9 billion based on end -of-year data . The DM backlog is tied to RPV as it costs more to repair a more expensive facility , therefore, as expected, DM increased with the deployment of DOE/NNSA's new, more accurate, data -driven approach from $5.8 billion as of FY 2020 to $6.1 billion as of FY 2021. The overall physi cal condition of DOE/ NNSA's infrastructure did not decline . Table 5 -2. DOE/NNSA deferred maintenance as a percentage of Replacement Plant Value Metric FY 2019 needs DM = deferred maintenance RPV = replacement plant value Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-21 In response to GAO recommendations, th is information is provided to improve transparency in the budget. Table 5-3 compares investments in Maintenance and Recapitalization to benchmarks (based on the percentage of beginning of the year RPV ) derived from the DOE Real Property Asset Management Pla n and associated guidance. DOE/ NNSA has decreased recapitalization investments by $25 million from FY 2022 to FY 2023 to support additional construction of larger facilities. Recapitalization continues to include deactivation and demolition of excess , and underu sed, facilities to reduce DOE/ NNSA 's footprint. Maintenance investments reflect a decrease d funding level from FY 2022 to FY 2023 due to the unanticipated increase ab ove the request level in FY 2022. Overall funding for maintenance has grown significantly , but appropriately , over the last several years. This sustained funding level will support current maintenance staffing levels to maintain and preserve facilities i n a condition suitable to meet an increasing mission demand. DOE/N NSA also continues to use targeted asset management programs that use supply chain management practices to increase purchasing power for common building components across the nuclear securi ty enterprise (e.g., roofs and heating, ventilating, and air conditioning).

FY 2023 President's Budget Request for Other Weapons Activities 5.8.2 Secure Transportation Asset Secure Transportation Asset (STA) provides safe, secure transport of the Nation's nuclear weapons, weapon components, and special nuclear material throughout the nuclear security enterprise. STA includes two subprograms: (1) O perations and Equipment and (2) Program Direction. Operations and Equipment provides the transportation service infrastructure re quire d for STA to meet DOE/ NNSA's nuclear security activities. Program Direction provides salaries, travel, and other related expenses for Federal Agents and the secure transportation workforce. 5.8.2.1 FY 2023 Budget Request Compared to FY 2021 Enacted Budget The budget request for Secure Transportation Asset decreased 1.2 percent from FY 2021. The overall budget request for Operations and Equipment decreased due to the completion of aircraft procurement in FY 2021, however, an increase is requested for the Mobile Guardian Transporter (MGT) subprogram to support its schedule deliverables including : Continued development of Engineering Release s Continued Pre -Production Unit stage builds Validation of the Pre-Produ ction Unit manufacturing process Test Article 2 Crash Test The budget request for Program Direction increased to support the transfer of support service contract costs from Operations and Equipment to Program Direction . 5.8.2.2 Key Milestones Aging transportation assets must be replaced to meet , and maintain , convoy safety and security requirements. The STA milestones in Figure 5-12 will enable DOE/NNSA to support evolving transportation requirements for the current and future stockpile. Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-23 Changes f rom last year's plan are: The FY 2037 milestone, Complete MGT production , is delayed to FY 2038 due to supply chain disruptions stemming from the COVID -19 pandemic; disruptions to materials and piece parts, and a loss of critical skills in the vendor bases are impacting deliverables. Custom electronic (printed wiring boards/printed wiring assembly) fabrication needed to support MGT has been especially impacted . This is a persistent issue, however, the MGT team is working to minimize future delays by looki ng at advanced purchases of materials needed for production to account for the extended delivery timeline. One milestone from last year's SSMP, Design and begin production of the next generation armored tractor and escort vehicle, was anticipated to be com pleted in FY 2022 but was not completed. This milestone is now split into two separate milestones, Design and begin production of the next generation armored tractor and Design and begin production of the next generation escort vehicle. Design and begin p roduction of the next generation armored tractor is delayed to 2025 due to inadequate vendor response. The program is evaluating the contracting vehicle and will continue pursuing this project. Design and begin production of the next generation escort veh icle is delayed to FY 2023. Prototypes are currently being evaluated, and final design review and production are anticipated to commence by the end of FY 2023. Figure 5 -12. Key milestones for Secure Transportation Asset 5.8.3 Defense Nuclear Security DOE/NNSA missions must be carried out in a secure environmen t protected by safeguards and security personnel, layers of physical security systems and technology, and sophisticated cybersecurity systems. Defense Nuclear Security (DNS ) provides protection across the nuclear security enterprise for DOE/ NNSA personnel , facilities, nuclear weapons, and materials from a full spectrum of threats, ranging from minor security incidents to acts of terrorism . The West End Protected Area Reduction (WEPAR) line -item project is also included within DNS. 5.8.3.1 FY 2023 Budget Request C ompared to FY 2021 Enacted Budget The budget request for DNS increased 11.8 percent from FY 2021 to FY 2023. The budget request for DNS increased to support: Refined security requirements associated with growth across the nuclear security enterprise , including plutonium pit production and the Uranium Processing Facility Increased security requirements related to design -basis threat implementation and sustaining core security requirements Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-24 Caerus , the highest priority Security Infrastructure Revitalization Program (SIRP) projects, and the highest priority initiatives for the Physical Security Center of Excellence and the Center for Security Technology, Analysis, Re sponse, and Testing (CSTART) Funding for the WEPAR line -item project decreased as construction moves toward completion. 5.8.3.2 Key Milestones The SIRP refreshes aging security infrastructure across the enterprise based on a long -range plan that is modified periodically based on DOE/NNSA's budget, mission, and needs. The DNS milestones in Figure 5-13 are directly linked to modernization of the national security infrastructure and will assure that DOE/NNSA mission requirements for the current and futu re stockpile are carried out in a safe and secure environment. Changes from last year's plan are: The FY 2024 milestone, Complete Y-12 WEPAR, PIDAS modernization, and entry control facility upgrade , is shifted to FY 2025 to correct a mistake in the FY 202 2 SSMP and align with the CD -4 date, as outlined in the approved CD -2/3 package . The FY 2026 milestone, Complete Caerus cutover , is delayed to FY 2027 due to the initial rollout delay, caused by supply chain issues. The FY 2029 milestone, Complete Pantex Perimeter Intru sion Detection and Assessment System (PIDAS ) physical security system components and infrastructure refresh for Zone 4 , is delayed to FY 2030 due to a reprioritization of SIRP 2030 , shifted to FY 2029 to reflect the CD -4 date for the SRS SRPPF PIDAS project. The training and certification of all forces and systems for the SRS SRPPF PIDAS will be complete in FY 2031. This milestone previously read Complete SRS PIDAS and has been upda ted for clarity. 6 Figure 5 -13. Key milestones for Defense Nuclear Security 6 The SRS SRPPF P IDAS is funded through the SRPPF Safeguards and Security Subproject, which has a CD -2/3 date of FY 2024 and a CD -4 date of FY 2029. Since the PIDAS is a major milestone within that subproject, it is called out separately in this graphic. Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-25 5.8.4 Information Technology and Cybersecurity The DOE/ NNSA Office of the Associate Administrator for Information Management and Chief Information Officer ( OCIO ) supports IT and cybersecurity services and solutions, which include continuous monitoring, cloud -based technologies, and enterprise security technologies to help meet security challenges. The DOE/ NNSA OCIO must provide a set of capabilities that enable t he mission to increase organizational efficiency, protect information assets, enhance communication with internal and external partners, ensure continuous monitoring, and support effective incident response. DOE/ NNSA OCIO executes a strong cybersecurity p rogram that funds ongoing operations and invests in improvements across the nuclear security enterprise to meet the President's Executive Order 14028 to improve the nation's cybersecurit y. 5.8.4.1 FY 2023 Budget Request Compared to FY 2021 Enacted Budget The budge t request for Information Technology and Cyber security increased 21.7 percent from FY 2021. The FY 2023 budget r equest includes funding for the operation and modernization of the Emergency Communications Network previously funded under Emergency Operation s within Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation . The budget request for IT and Cybersecurity increased to support : Investments in cybersecurity tools and services provided to the enterprise Technology modernization investments for critical classified and unclassified systems 5.8.4.2 Key Milestones The milestones in Figure 5-14 are necessary steps toward achieving a modernized IT infrastructure and cybersecurity posture for the nuclear security enterprise. Several milestones with ongoing activities from last year' s SSMP anticipated for completion in FY 2022 have been reworked and are not published again in Figure 5 -14: Implement Phase II of DOE/NNSA's IT Modernization Plan Begin architecture development of the classified wireless network for non -pit production faci lities Deploy KCNSC hybrid cloud platform in support of Joint Technology Demonstrator project Perform cybersecurity program budget re -baseline site assessments Develop phase II system architecture for modernizing the Enterprise Secure Computing environment Implement special network access Implement the DOE/NNSA Application Modernization Strategy Implement a Telecommunications Security Program within DOE/NNSA Complete the modernization of the Information Assurance Response Center cybersecurity infrastructure An a dditional milestone that w as not published in last year's SSMP was completed in FY 2022: Complete the external Institute for Defense Analys es cybersecurity assessment Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-26 Figure 5 -14. Key milestones for Information Technology and Cybersecurity 5.8.5 Legacy C ontractor Pensions and Settlement Payments Starting in FY 2022, Legacy Contractor Pensions and Settlement Payments includes funding to reimburse the University of California for a portion of a settlement reached in 2019 with former University of California employees of LLNL related to health care plans, as well as funding for DOE/NNSA's share of the unfunded liability of the Savannah River Nuclear Solutions pension plan. This budget line also continues to include the Weapons Activities share of the DOE's a nnual reimbursement made to the University of California Retirement Plan for former University of California employees and annuitants who worked at the LLNL and LANL . 5.9 Budget Projections Beyond FY 2027 This section explains the cost estimation methodology that DOE/NNSA uses to create long -term budget projections. These projections are used to evaluate, over a longer timeframe than considered in the FYNSP and during programming activities, the total requ ired resources to accomplish the program of record, how those resources are allocated, and the overall affordability of the program (see Section 5.10). 5.9.1 Basis for Budget Projections For most of Weapons Activities, t he FY 2023-FY 2027 budget request was generated as part of the DOE /NNSA planning and programming process and reflect s a roll-up of individual estimates developed interactively by Federal Program Managers and DOE/NNSA 's M&O partners using historical cost data, current plans for programs and pr ojects, and expert judgment. The budget requests for Stockpile Major Modernization programs are informed by the processes described in Section 5.9.2. The budget estimates for FY 2028 and beyond reflect the costs of continuing the FYNSP program described in this SSMP , while sustaining , and enhancing , the Weapons Activities capabilities that are essential to executing the stockpile mission. The budget projections beyond the FYNSP are based on requirements and will vary , depending on the individual program o r subprogram. Some portions of the Weapons Activities portfolio are assumed to continue beyond the FYNSP at the same level of effort as during the FYNSP.7 For these cost projections, such as for Stockpile Sustainment, an escalation factor of 2.1 percent was applied . Some portions of the program , primarily Stockpile Major Modernization programs and major programmatic construction projects , will not proceed at the same level of effort from FY 2028 through FY 2047. The estimates and the basis for each of these elements of the Weapons Activities portfolio are described in Section s 5.9.2 -5.10 . 7 Projection of b udget estimates for these efforts in this way assumes the continued manageability of whatever risks are present during the FYNSP at the same level of effort over the FYNSP period, as is typically represented by the funding level of the last year of the FYN SP. Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-27 5.9.2 Stockpile Major Modernization Stockpile Major Modernization programs have the goal of extending the lifetime of the nation's nuclear stockpile while addressing required updates and improving their safety and security as possible . Figure 2-2 in Chapter 2, \"Stockpile Management,\" provides a summary of planned Stockpile Major Modernization activities . The next sections summarize cost estimates for Stockpile Major Modernization programs within the current 25 -year period . The basis for the cost estimates varies from those using t op-down cost models (such as analogy comparisons to past work completed , parametric relationships , and subject matter expert judgment ) to those using bottom -up models (deterministic, unit cost, and activity -based) . The decision to use the top-down cost model v ersu s the bottom -up model is made depending on where the warhead program is in the Phase X/6.X Process , reflecting the maturity of the process . Reflecting decisions made during the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review , no funding is requested for the W80 -4 Alteration Sea -launched Cruise Missile -Nuclear (SLCM -N) program i n the FY 2023 budget request. The program, following direction in the Nuclear Posture Review , has been removed from this section. 5.9.2.1 Cost Estimates across the Phase X/6.X Process Figure 5 -15 shows the governing cost estimate type for each phase of the Phase 6.X Process and the Phase X Process . DOE/NNSA works in conjunction with DoD and M&O partners to develop, refine, and update the estimates throughout these processes . Figure 5 -15. Cost estimates across the Phase 6. X Process The DOE/NNSA Office of Management an d Budget , Office of Programming, Analysis and Evaluation develops and publish es major modernization planning cost estimates for the SSMP . These cost estimates are initiate d at very early program maturity , often well before Phase 6.1 , Concept Assessment , and are planning estimates for alternatives analysis, early programming, and budget deliberations. These planning estimates for Stockpile Major Modernization are: Based on a defined scope and cost uncertainty at the time and updated annually f or the SSMP8 8 Planning estimates assume scopes that are in line with current policy objectives (such as a commitment to surety upgrades ) for the modernization effort . The Nuclear Weapons Council approves the specific scope for the weapon modernization program based on the alternatives developed during Phase 6.2/2. The cost estimate range used in a planning estimate reflects the uncertainty in implementing a single ass umed point solution , rather than the range of every possible design solution. Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-28 Inclusive of warhead modernization program (development and production) and non -warhead modernization program line-item costs that are critical to program success (namely Other Program Money and DoD costs)9 Unconstrained by future budget av ailability, which may differ from future budget requests These cost estimates are used to reflect the anticipated cost of each modernization program in the SSMP until the Weapon Design and Cost Report ( WDCR ) is approv ed for the effort . The estimate methodology is described in more detail in S ection 5.9.2.2. The WDCR is developed by the program teams responsible for the warhead modernization programs and provides cost estimates for design, qualification, production, and life cycle activ ities. The WDCR includes detailed multi -site input and, although primarily performed using a bottom -up approach, may contain other methodologies (e.g., parametric, analogous, and subject matter expertise). The WDCR developed during Phase 6.2A , Design Def inition and Cost Study , is a key input into the Phase 6.2A study report to the Nuclear Weapons Council and is required prior to entry to Phase 6.3. Once approved by the Nuclear Weapons Council, the WDCR becomes the basis for the Selected Acquisition Repor t (SAR) to Congress required upon entry into Phase 6.3. The Baseline Cost Report (BCR) , which is also developed by the program team, formally updates the WDCR based on late development and pre -production activities. The BCR is updated based on refined scopes and schedule definitions (reflecting the increased maturity of the program) and represents a more definitive cost estimate than either the planning estimate or WDCR. The NNSA Administrator approves a program baseline, including the BCR, prior to Phase 6.3. The BCR supersedes previous cost estimates and becomes the program of record, which is transmitted annually to Congress as pa rt of the SAR. The DOE/NNSA Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation conducts an independent cost review prior to Phase 6.2A, and independent cost estimates prior to entry into Phase 6.3, Phase 6.4, and 6.5 , First Production . 5.9.2.2 DOE/NNSA Office of M anagement and Budget Cost Estimating Methodology The DOE/ NNS A's Office of Programming, Analysis and Evaluation planning estimates for Stockpile Major Modernization programs are developed in the following manner: Performed using a \"top -down\" analogy method that is consistent with early -stage planning10 Informed by ongoing and past program costs (such as the development of the W76 -1, B61 -12, W88 Alt the W76 -1, B61 -12 and W88 Alt 370) and the evaluation of the relative com plexities of future systems11 9 In estimating the cost of a warhead modernization program, the weapon programs depend on an adequately funded base of other DOE/NNSA capabilities, as well as activities that are incremental to that base, and reflect both each program's budgeted line-item and increments to other critical activities (such as early -stage technology maturation [called O ther Program Money ]). As the overall program integrator, the Federal Program Man ager identifies the funding streams needed for the program to be successful and coordinated with other programs to ensure funding is available to support the modernization program 10 Additional detail on the cost estimating methodology of DOE/NNSA 's Office of Management and Budget planning estimates can be found in the technical paper, \"Planning for the Future: Methodologies for Estimating U.S. Nuclear Stockpile Cost\" (Lewis et al. 2016; Cost Engineering , 58 [5], pp. 6 -12). 11 These program and subject matter experts evaluate the relative scope complexity between the complete W76 -1 and near - complete B61 -12 LEP and W88 Alt 370 Program compared to each planned future warhead modernization program , which aids in providing a cost estimate range based on underlying technical and cost uncertaint ies. Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-29 Based on time -phased d evelopment costs using a standard profile,12 as well as p roduction costs using a nonlinear cost growth profile similar to that of the W76 -1 Based on technical and programmatic inputs from Federal Program Managers, Federal site offices, and subject matter expert s across the national security laboratories and nuclear weapons production facilities Cost ranges reflect the underlying technical and modeling uncertainties of the programmatic scope at the time. D uring the early stages of warhead acquisitions (Phases 1/6.1 and 2/6.2), designs may experience scope changes due to ongoing down -select decisions regarding threshold and objective requirements, which may result in cost changes compared to those reported i n previous SSMPs. These ranges will typically be greatest for earlier -stage programs and narrow over time. The cost estimates for future systems with little design definition were based on the W87 -1 and W93 estimate s, with an expanded range due to uncert ainty in scope and quantities and in the escalation rate so far in the future. 5.9.2.3 Current Estimates Figures 5-16 through 5-20 and Tables 5-4 through 5-12 provide cost estimates for each Stockpile Major Modernization program for the 25 -year SSMP timeframe. Table 5-4 delineates the type of cost estimate for each of the warhead modernization programs included in the 25 -year plan. Additional detail s on the basis for each estimate are provided for each individual program in Sections 5.9.2.4 through 5.9.2. 10. Table 5 -4.

The Cost Analyst's Companion , 3rd ed., McLean, VA: Logistics Management Institute, McLean, VA. 13 SAR and WDCR values are provided when available. For programs that only have a planning estimate, the proposed budget is provided ; for programs pre -phase 1/6.1 the p90 value of a representative design and quantity is provided . Tables 8-5 through 8-13 provide values for a high and low estimate range, in addition to the SAR, WDCR, or planning estimate totals. Due to the differing types of cost estimates, the accuracy of these total program cost estimates varies. 14 The total estimated costs for the W87 -1 Modification program represent the midpoint between the p50 and p85 values. Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-30 Each Stockpile Major Modernization program section contains a summary table with high, low, and nominal (proposed budget or BCR/SAR value) estimates for DOE/NNSA and DoD, in constant FY 2022 and then -year dollars . Where appropriate, the tables also include pre -SAR values for pre -Phase 6.2 costs.15 The low estimates presented in the tables and graphs as the green line represent the mid -point (p50) of the cost estimate . The high estimates continue to represent the 85th percent (p85) for the B61 -4, W87 -1, and W93; the estimate increased to the 90th percent (p90) for the future systems to reflect the greater uncertainty. For early -stage programs using planning estimates (such as the W87 -1 Modification Program), the figures and tables reflect the proposed FY 2023 FYNSP budget and, for years beyond FY 2023, the midpoint between the high and low estimates. Items to consider when comparing estimates to one another: The constant -year cost totals in the tables are the most comparable because inflation effects become significant over warhead modernization activity timeframes . Consideration should also be given to the varying quantities of warheads being refurbished for each system. The FY 2023 SSMP's classified Annex provides additional information on production quantities. The then -year pla nning estimates in the tables and figures are derived from constant -year estimates using an escalation rate of 3.0 percent. This 3.0 percent rate represents an average of the individual site escalation rates as documented in current WDCR/BCR estimates. T he WDCR and BCR program office estimates are developed at the site and component level , and therefore use the escalation rates specific to each site and function rather than an average. Published estimate ranges are meant to reflect the underlying technic al and cost uncertainty of the assumed scope. E arly-stage programs, particular ly those before Phase 6.3, may experience significant scope changes because the Nuclear Weapons Council may update and/or down -select design options that significantly impact th e work scope and cost estimate. Only the planning estimates include pre -Phase 6.2 costs. The WDCR and BCR/SAR estimates do not include these costs. 5.9.2.4 B61-12 Life Extension Program Cost Estimate The B61 -12 LEP received authorization to enter Phase 6.5 in FY 2021 and achieved first production unit in November 2021. In 2022, the Nuclear Weapons Council formally accepted the B61 -12 into the stockpile and authorized Phase 6.6, Full-Scale Production . Additionally, all commercial off -the-shelf Base Metal Electrod e capacitor components that experienced an issue in late 2019 have completed first production unit and are at or are ramping to full -rate production. The values for development and production costs in Figure 5 -16 and Table 5 -5 reflect DOE/NNSA's FY 2020 BCR update issued in November 2020, with an overall cost estimate of $8.3 billion (then -year dollars) and are unchanged from last year's SSMP. The B61-12 LEP completed its use of Other Program Money for multi -system production process improvements in FY 2022. The costs of these related programs are estimated to be $648 million . 15 DoD amounts reflect the costs for weapon components for which DoD is responsible, such as arming and fuzing. While not budgeted or executed by DOE/NNSA, these costs reflect the program's best approximation and are published for transparency to better reflect anticipated all -in costs. The total estimated cost is provided because warhead modernization program pr ofiles often have later portions that extend beyond the published 25-year SSMP timeframe.

The Nuclear Weapons Council formally accepted the W88 Alt 370 into the stockpile in December 2021 and authorized Phase 6.6 entry in 2022. The current estimate is unchanged from the updated BCR issued by DOE/NNSA in September 2020, with an estimate of $2.8 billion (then -year dollars) . The revised BCR was reconciled with the independent cost estimate performed by DOE/NNSA's Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation. The W88 Alt 370 Program is co ntinuing to use other DOE/NNSA programs for multi -system production process improvements . The estimated costs of these related programs (Other Program Money ) remain unchanged at $171 million. The numbers in Figure 5 -17 and Table 5-6 reflect the BCR update. 16 The value for FY 2012 has been updated from previous SSMPs to represent the appropriate SAR value for that year. The SAR value represents money spent after Phase 6.3 approval in July 2012 . 17 The DoD costs in this table represent funds provided by DoD for work by DOE/NNSA on specific components , per cost sharing agreements between DoD and DOE/NNSA , and does not include work done exclusively by DoD, such as the B6 1-12 tail kits .

In 2019, the Nuclear Weapons Council reviewed a series of surety architecture design options , to include detailed risk/benefit and cost analyses , before selecting a single surety option for W87 -1 Modification Program. DOE/NNSA continues to evaluate other component design options and trades. In FY 2021, the W87 -1 Modification Program completed Phase 6.2 and enter ed Phase 6.2A . The cost estimate in Figure 5-19 represents the latest projected program cost reflecting downselect and trade studies completed in Phase 6.2, and the FYNSP is informed by the ongoing WDCR .

Total estimated cost for W87 -1 Modification Program 5.9.2.8 W93 Program Cost Estimate The W93 Program will mitigate future risk to the sea leg of the nuclear triad and address the changing strategic environment. DOE/NNSA is coordinating with DoD on specific requirements and design options for the W93 Program, which entered Phase 2 in FY 2022. T he W93 Program cost estimate (see Table 5 -9) is based on preliminary assumptions for one of the W93 design s, Option 2A, and provides a planning estimate only . The midpoint of the estimates (average of p50 and p85) for the entire list of options ana lyzed in the Phase 1 study ranged from $17.1 billion to $26.1 billion in then -year dollars, including O ther Program Money . These estimate s will change as requirements and schedules are refined and will be updated in future versions of the SSMP. 18 Since the W87 -1 Modification Program is using a planning estimate, the red and green lines represent the high and low estimates based on funding models from historical data. The blue bars in this figure show the program's proposed FY 202 3 FYNSP budget and, for years beyond FY 2023, the midpoint between the high and low estimates from the funding models.

These warheads currently include the Future Strategic Land -Based Warhead, the F uture Strategic Sea-Based W arhead, the -Delivered Warhead, -Launched Warhead ( to replace the W76 -1/2) that will be needed in the 2040s. The military capabilities required from the Future Strategic Land -Based Warhead and the Future Strategic Sea -Based Warhead, form erly referred to as Interoperable Warheads or Future Ballistic Missile Warheads, are being analyzed, and appropriate requirements are being developed to address emerging threats , and aging concerns , in candidate stockpile warheads. The Future Strategic M issile Warhead cost estimate s (see Table 5 -10, Table 5 -11, and Table 5 -12) provide a planning estimate for notional system s based on an existing stockpile weapon scope with increased uncertainty in design scope and quantities, adjusted for out -year escalat ion.

These early planning estimates, published as much as a decade or more before a project's initial mission approval, primarily inform long -term cost proj ections for programmatic construction and are supplemental to DOE acquisition requirements outlined in DOE Order 413.3B. Notably, these cost estimates are : Performed by a n organization separate from the Federal program office19 Performed using a top-dow n parametric method consistent with early -stage planning Based on historic DOE/NNSA project schedules, costs, and project phasing Based on current anticipated project scopes Based on affordability analysis Updated annually for the SSMP Once a project begin s the acquisition process, the approved cost estimate ranges at the CD -0 milestone, Approve Mission Need , supersede previous estimates and becomes the basis for resource planning. The project then progresses as described in DOE Order 413.3B (i.e., alterna tive selection and cost range at CD-1, performance baseline at CD -2, etc.). Per DOE Order 413.3B and DOE/ NNSA policy, the project cost estimates are reconciled with independent cost estimates or independent cost reviews performed by either the Office of C ost Estimati ng and Program Evaluation (pre -CD-0 and -1) or DOE's Office o f Project Management (pre -CD-2). The early -stage planning estimates use technical input based on an assumed scope. However, these assumptions do not predetermine the project's actual acquisition strategy or the outcome of subsequent AoAs. The assumed scope should be considered estimated until the design matures and the project reaches CD -2, Performance Baseline . The cost estimation professional society , American Association of Cost Engineering International , has published a cost estimate classification system20 based on the scope definition of the project. DOE/NNSA has mapped the American Association of Cost Engineering International cost estimate classes to the most common u ses for capital acquisitions .21 Table 5-13 summarizes the cost estimation classification system, including the level of project definition, the expected uncertainty range, and the corresponding DOE /NNSA capital acquisition milestones. Note t hat the estimate ranges and typical applications represent rough expectations and cannot simply be applied to an estimate to determine uncertainty. 19 The DOE/NNSA Office of Management and Budget, Office of Programing, Analysis and Evaluation, performs the cost estimates on behalf of Defense Programs. 20 American Association of Cost Engineering International Recommended Practice 18R -97, Cost Estimation Classification System as Applied in Engineering, Procurement and Construction for the Process Industries . 21 DOE G uide 413.3 -21A, Cost Estimating Guide .

DOE/ NNSA continues to execute the schedules of multiple ongoing major capital acquisition projects, such as the Uranium Processing Facility and U1a Complex Enhancements projects. A list of major capital acquisition project proposals has been developed through the efforts of a series of working groups and deep dives with representatives from DOE/ NNSA sites and responsible Federal offices. The schedule for the highest -priority project proposals is shown by major capital acquisition projects and project proposals listed in Chapter 4, \"Infrastructure and Operations.\" T his planning schedule will be updated annually. Changes will be made based on available funding and programmatic priorities. The current program of record and the vetted programmatic construction project proposals included in Figures 4-5 through 4-11 are the basis for the aggregated cost estimates shown in Table 5-14.22 Table 5-14 lists low and high estimate s in then -year doll ars for planned and proposed programmatic capital acquisition projects from FY 2023 through FY 2047.

It does not include mission enabling construction projects. Department of En ergy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 5-39 The difference in the es timates as compared to the FY 2022 SSMP are a result of further analysis and higher fidelity estimates on major construction projects, including Domestic Uranium Enrichment and Depleted Uranium Manufacturing Capabilities. 5.10 Affordability As described throughout this document, DOE/NNSA is undertaking a risk -informed, complex, and time -constrained modernization and recapitalization effort in coordination with DoD . DOE/NNSA must make concerted investments now to make available the necessary capabilities and infrastructure to execute modernization programs to meet DoD timelines. If adjustments need to be made in future years, DOE/NNSA will work with DoD to consider and adjust schedule and/or scope to major activities, including potential effects to warhead modernization programs and infrastructure projects. DOE/NNSA needs are subject to a high level of uncertainty due to the unique requirements inherent in the work that must be completed to meet objectives. Limited numbers of completed projects with similar complexity and scope, low quantities, stringent specifications, and multi -year development schedules add to the high level of uncertainty in early estimates . For these reas ons, the projected costs beyond FY 2023 incorporate some amount of uncertainty in the out -year weapons modernization and construction resource needs. These later plans and estimates are compared to external straight -line budget projections that have not b een adjusted to be more predictive based on actual scope and schedule . Variances are managed as the out -years estimates move into the FYNSP window and as scope and schedule are further refined . Budget projections for the out -years incorporate the Stockpil e Major Modernization program cost estimates described in Section 5.9.2 and the cost estimates for the planned major programmatic construction projects described in Chapter 4, Section 4.2.1. Significant out -year projects include: Reestablishing a plutoniu m pit production capability Reestablishing a Domestic Uranium Enrichment capability Revitalizing depleted uranium manufacturing capability Modernizing DOE/NNSA's SRT&E capabilities for certifying warheads upon entry into the stockpile Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page 6-1 Chapter 6 Conclusion This Department of Energy 's National Nuclear Security Administration 's (DOE/NNSA) Fiscal Year 202 3 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary (SSMP), together with its classified annex, is a key planning document for the nuclear security enterprise . This SSMP is the culmination of planning and programming efforts across numerous DOE/NNSA programs and organizations and documents the 25 -year plan for ensuring the safety, security, and effectiveness of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. The fiscal year ( FY) 2023 SSMP also details efforts to maintain the scientific and engineering tools, capabilities, and infrastructure that underpin the current and futur e nuclear deterrent. The SSMP was prepared by the DOE/NNSA Federal workforce in collaboration with DOE/NNSA's management and operating partners and coordinated with the Department of Defense through the Nuclear Weapons Council. In large part due to the c urrent global security environment, DOE/ NNSA executed its largest program in its 21 -year history, advanc ing the Nation's nuclear security mission through innovative science and technology solutions. These efforts are critical to ensuring the U.S. strategic deterrent remain s safe, secure, and effective, and that the deterrence commitments extended to U.S. allies remain s strong and credible .

(d) BRIEFINGS .\u2014 (1) INITIAL BRIEFING. \u2014Not later than April 1, 2021, the Administrator shall provide to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representati ves a briefing on the designation of the official required by subsection (a), including on \u2014 (A) the responsibilities assigned to that official; and (B) the plan for providing that official with resources sufficient to conduct the monitoring required by subsection (a). (2) SUBSEQUENT BRIEFINGS. \u2014Not later than April 1, 2022, and annually thereafter through 2024, the Administrator shall provide to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives a briefing on activities carried out under this section that includes an assessment of the progress made by the official designated under subsection (a) in conducting the monitoring required by that subsection. The committee notes that the NNSA industrial base shares many of the same chal lenges faced by that of the Department of Defense (DOD): parts and materials are procured in small quantities, at irregular intervals, and with exacting performance specifications. Unlike the DOD, however, the NNSA does not comprehensively monitor the heal th of its industrial base and instead has left this responsibility to individual programs or contractors. As a result, efforts are fragmented and duplicative, as identified by the Department of Energy Inspector General in a July 2018 report titled ''Suppli er Quality Management at National Nuclear Security Administration Sites'' (DOE -IG-18-41). The committee believes that this provision would help the NNSA reduce cost, schedule, and performance risk in future programs. A.11 Related Legislation : S. 1605A NDAA \u00a7 3135. Reports on risks to and gaps in industrial base for nuclear weapons components, subsystems, and materials Section 3113 of the William M.

Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page B-1 Appendix B Weapons Activities Capabilities This appendix describes the breadth of capabilities maintained by Weapons Activities programs in the Department of Energy 's National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) nuclear security enterprise to execute the stockpile mission. These capabilities should not be viewed in isolation or as mutually exclusive , as many overlap and are complementary . They represent the und erlying disciplines, activities, and specialized skills required to meet DOE/ NNSA missions. In this document, the capabilities are presented as facets of s even interdependent areas , each containing a suite of capabilities that together address a particula r aspect of Weapons Activities. In part, this appendix supports the legislative requ irements listed in Appendix A. As part of its portfolio management approach for Weapons Activities, DOE/NNSA continuously evaluates the health of the Weapons Activities capabilities , which are comprised of four elements: Human capital (experience, skill, people) Physical assets (facilities, infrastructure, equipment) Resources (resources, materials) Enabling processes (knowledge, technology, processes) All four elements must be sustained and modernized to meet current and future missions. If any of these elements are missing, the capabilities cannot function as a system. Chapters 3 and 4 detail t he evaluation of the four elements of each capability. B.1 Weapon Science and Engineering The Weapon Science and Engineering area includes the suite of physical sciences and engineering disciplines that comprise the theoretical and experimental capabilities necessary to assess the current nuclear stockpile and certify futur e stockpile weapons. Capability Definition Atomic Physics, Nuclear Physics, Nuclear Engineering , and Radiochemistry Atomic physics is the study of atomic systems, such as a collection of atoms and electrons, and their interaction with X-rays. The extremely high temperatures of functioning nuclear weapons generate X-rays. Nuclear physics is the study of atomic nuclei and their constituents , and nuclear engineering is the translation of nuclear physics principles to the practical application of nuclear interactions, especially fission and fusion . The need to understand the design and function of the nuclear explosive package drive s the requirement to improve understanding of both fission and fusion, which requires new experimental data from the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE ). Radiochemistry is the study of radioactive materials and their interactions. It is critical to evaluating data from legacy underground testing, as well as modeling problems in nuclear forensics and attribut ion. Thermonuclear fusion experiments at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) , Omega Laser Facility (Omega) , and Z pulsed power facility (Z) can use radiochemical tracers in their diagnostic suites. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page B-2 Capability Definition Materials Science, High Explosives and Energetics Science and Engineering , Chemistry, and Actinide Science Materials science, in th is context of stockpile stewardship, is the study of how materials in a nuclear weapon are produced, age, and are replaced . Chemistry studies the elemental composi tion, structure, bonding, and properties of matter . The stability of material properties and the nature of reactions and interactions are critical component s of system aging studies. How materials and properties change with time must be understood to ens ure reliability and safety of the stockpile. Strength, aging, compatibility, viability, and damage mechani cs are among the materials characteristics to be evaluated. Materials science and chemistry play a key role in resolving stockpile and production issues, validating computational models, and developing new materials (e.g., materials produced through additive manufacturing) . Actinide science is the study of physics and chemistry of elements from actinium to lawrencium. This is useful to understand pr oduction, purification, compatibility, targets, and behavior of actinide materials relevant to the stockpile. This section also includes high explosives and energetics science and engineering, which are the study of detonation and deflagration physics, sh ock wave propagation, and reaction initiation. It includes the design, synthesis, manufacture, inspection, testing and evaluation of high explosives and other energetic materials and components for specific applications. Knowledge of these materials is necessary for understanding nuclear weapon performance. Data required to advance and underpin this knowledge is obtained from LANSCE and national light source facilities. High Energy Density Science and Plasma Physics High energy density science is the study of matter and radiation under extreme conditions such as those in a functioning nuclear weapon and reproduced in high -temperature experiments. Plasma physics is the study of systems containing separate ions and ele ctrons that exhibit a collective behavior. The extremely high temperatures of functioning nuclear weapons generate plasma. Facilities such as NIF, Omega, and Z generate high energy density states , producing data exploring the physical processes that occu r in plasma states to validate computational models. Technologies for Creating Extreme Conditions (lasers, accelerators, pulsed power) This capability area includes laser, pulsed power, and accelerator technologies that are focused on creating extreme conditions under which to study weapons -relevant matter and radiation behavior . Lasers are coherent light sources delivering intense beams of energy to localized regions to generate and probe high energy density conditions similar to those produced during nuclear weapon operation. A laser's rapid energy delivery enables studies of fundamental properties of matter, radiation transport, hydro dynamics and turbulence, thermonuclear ignition and burn, as well as outputs and effects. Pulsed power devices accumulate energy over long periods of time and release it rapidly to generate extreme pressures, temperatures, and radiation conditions. Accel erators use electromagnetic fields to accelerate charged particles to the velocities needed to generate high -energy X-rays, protons, or neutrons. The resulting emissions are sources for advanced imaging, investigating nuclear physics phenomena, or simulat ing weapons outputs and hostile environments. Advancements in these areas produce data critical to understanding physical phenomena, qualifying nuclear weapon components, and improving performance assessments. Facilities include NIF, Omega, LANSCE, and Z . Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page B-3 Capability Definition Advanced Experimental Diagnostics and Sensors Advanced diagnostics and sensors provide detailed measurements of materials, objects, and dynamic processes that are critical to weapon operation and other national security operations. Standard diagnostics provide lower -resolution data suitable for basic inquiries, but not for detailed part, process, or physics qualification; continued diagnostic and sensor development is important to addressing these limitations. An example of an advanced diagnostic is st atic or multi -frame dynamic radiography at high resolution. Radiography is an imaging technique that uses X -rays or subatomic particles (e.g., protons, neutrons) to view the internal structure of an object that is opaque to visible light. Static radiogra phy of a stationary object is used during the post -fabrication inspection process to ensure that components are defect -free and meet exacting quality requirements. Dynamic radiography takes multiple images of a dynamic process to examine physical behavior in progress. Hydrodynamic and Subcritical Experiments Hydrodynamic experiments explore implosion physics and provide data on the behavior of full -scale dynamic systems. Subcritical experiments are driven by high explosives and contain special nuclear material (SNM) that never achieves a critical configuratio n and does not create nuclear yield. Both types of experiments provide data that are essential to validating models within multi - physics design codes and predicting nuclear weapon performance. B.2 Weapon Simulation and Computing The Weapon Simulation and Computing area includes high -performance computers, weapons codes, models, and data analytics used to assess the behavior of nuclear weapons and components. It must support calculations of sufficient resolution and complexity to simulate and assess the behavior of weapon systems, components, and fundamental science processes that are critical to nuclear weapon performance. Capability Definition High Performance Computing High performance computing (HPC) encompasses software, hardware, and facilities of sufficient power to achieve the dimensionality, resolution, and complexity in simulation codes to accurately model the performance of weapon systems and components and the fundamental physical processes that are critical to nuclear operation. This capability includes research and development (R&D) in computer, information, and mathematical sciences to support developing and operating HPC. Simulation C apabilities for Weapon Science, Engineering, and Physics Advanced computer codes, models, and data analytics are used to simulate and assess the behavior of nuclear weapons and their components. Codes range in application from design of systems to fundamental science processes. DOE/NNSA codes operate on compu ters ranging from desktop machines to the world's largest high -performance supercomputers. B.3 Weapon Design and Integration The Weapon Design and Integration area encompasses the capabilities needed to design, test, analyze, qualify, and integrate components and subsystems into weapon systems that will meet all military requirements and endure all predicted environments to validate and verify that they will always work as expected and never work when not intended. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page B-4 Capability Definition Weapons Phys ics Design and Analysis Design and analysis of the nuclear explosive package is required to maintain existing U .S. nuclear weapons; modernize the stockpile; evaluate possible proliferant nuclear weapons; and respond to emerging threats, unanticipated events, and technological innovation. Elements of design capability include concept exploration, conceptual design, requirements satisfaction, detailed design and development, production, process development, certification, and qualification . Weapons physics analysis includes evaluation of weapons effects. Weapons Engineering Design, Analysis, and Integration Elements of weapons engineering include the following life cycle phases: concept exploration, requirements satisfaction, conceptual design, detailed design and development, production, certification, and qualification. This capability also encompasses systems integration, which includes understanding and developing the interfaces among the non -nuclear subsystems, between th e non -nuclear components and the nuclear explosives package, and between DOE/NNSA and Department of Defense (DoD) systems. Environmental Effects Analysis, Testing, and Engineering Sciences Environmental effects analysis, testing, and engineering sciences use an array of test equipment, tools, and techniques to create stockpile -to-target sequence conditions and measure the ensuing response of materials, components, and systems. Examples of environmental testing (normal, hostile, and abnormal) include shock , vibration, radiation, acceleration, temperature, electrostatics, and pressure conditions. The engineering sciences that support this analysis include thermal and fluid sciences, structural mechanics, dynamics, aerodynamics, and electromagnetics. Weapon s Surety Design, Testing, Analysis, and Manufacturing Weapons surety design, analysis, integration, and manufacturing employ a variety of safety and use control systems to prevent accidental nuclear detonation and unauthorized use of nuclear weapons to ens ure a safe and secure stockpile. This knowledge, infrastructure, and equipment requires strict classification control and secure facilities. Radiation -Hardened Microelectronics Design and Manufacturing Research, design, production, and testing of radiati on-hardened microelectronics is required for nuclear weapons to function properly in hostile environments. This capability requires a secure, trusted supply chain, including quality control of the materials used in the process and products. B.4 Weapon Materi al Processing and Manufacturing The Weapon Material Processing and Manufacturing area covers the packaging, processing, handling, and/or manufacture of plutonium, uranium, tritium, energetic and hazardous materials, lithium, and other metal and organic mat erials needed for nuclear weapons. Capability Definition Plutonium Management Components that contain plutonium require special conduct of operations, physical security protection, facilities, and equipment to handle, package, process, manufacture, and inspect these components. Uranium Management Components that contain enriched and depleted uranium require special conduct of operations, physical security protection, facilities, and equipment to handle, package, process, manufacture, an d inspect these components. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page B-5 Capability Definition Tritium Management Tritium has a 12 -year half -life and must be periodically replenished in gas transfer systems. Tritium is produced by irradiating tritium -producing burnable absorber rods (TPBARs) in T ennessee Valley Authority 's Watts Bar nuclear reactors. Handling and processing of tritium includes transporting TPBARs to the Savannah River Site and extracting tritium from the TPBARS, as well as purifying, storing , and loading the tritium into gas transfer system reservoirs and inspecting reservoirs. Tritium is also recovered from returned gas transfer systems. High Explosives and Energetics Management Development and production of energetics, including the assoc iated manufacturing processes and infrastructure modernization to meet legacy and modernization stockpile applications. Energetics are materials that provide instantaneous energy through an exothermic chemical reaction. Energetics include specific end pr oducts, such as high explosives (conventional and insensitive) low explosives (pyrotechnics and propellants), their respective energetic ingredients, and various inert ingredients required for manufacturing (e.g., polymers, reactants, catalysts, plasticize rs, oxidizers, fuels, ballistic modifiers, stabilizers, surfactants, and bonding agents). Lithium Management Handling, packaging, processing, manufacturing, and inspecting c omponents that contain lithium materials require special conduct of operations, ph ysical security protection, facilities, and equipment. Additional Material Needs Specialized components and materials that are not commercially available must be produced within the nuclear security enterprise. This production may require synthesis of organic materials and processing, manufacturing, and inspection of metallic and orga nic products, based on knowledge of material behavior, compatibility, and aging. This include s, but is not limited to, polymer material and part manufacturing. B.5 Weapon Component Production The Weapon Component Production area includes the core capabilities for producing the components and systems required to arm, fuze, fire, and deliver nuclear weapons to their target s. The Weapon Component Production area includes the capabilities for producing the non -nuclear components and systems for weaponization of the nuclear explosive package. These functions enable the weapons to arm, fuze, and fire for the designed function when needed. This capability includes both internal and external manufacturing and a broad supply base , as wel l as identification and verification of trusted suppliers to provide materials and parts within the weapon product realization process. Capability Definition Non -Nuclear Component Modernization and Production Non -nuclear weapon components and assembly processes require special manufacturing, assembly, and inspection protocols. The components include, but are not limited to, cable assemblies; electronic assemblies; microelectronics packaging; gas transfer systems; arming, connectors; environmental sensing devices; radars; neutron generators; and power sources. Weapon Component and Material Process Development Process development of weapon components involves small -lot production, precise control s, and a deep understanding of the hazards of working with SNM and other exotic materials. Component process development is needed whenever process changes are made to reduce cost or production time. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page B-6 Capability Definition Weapon Component and System Prototyping Development, q ualification, and manufacture of high -fidelity, full -scale prototype weapon components and systems reduce the cost and life cycle time to develop and qualify new designs and technologies. This capability includes the ability to design, manufacture, and em ploy mockups with sensors to support laboratory and flight tests that provide evidence that components can function with DoD delivery systems in realistic environments. Advanced Manufacturing Advanced manufacturing uses innovative techniques from indust ry, academia, or internal R&D to reduce costs, reduce component development and production time , improve safety and performance, and control waste streams. Examples include additive manufacturing, use of microreactors, microwave casting, and electrorefini ng. B.6 Weapon Assembly, Storage, Testing, and Disposition After weapon components are produced, each requires assembly into complete warheads and temporary storage before delivery to DoD . Some of these warheads are removed from the stockpile on a n annual basis for surveillance to provide data to evaluate the hea lth of the stockpile. These surveillance activities (such as inspections, laboratory and flight tests, nondestructive tests, and component and material evaluations) provide data over time to predict, detect, assess, and resolve aging trends and any observ ed anomalies. This process requires disassembly and sometimes reassembly. At their end of life or for other reasons, nuclear weapons undergo disposition. The Weapon Assembly, Storage, Testing, and Disposition area covers all of these capabilities. Capab ility Definition Weapon Assembly, Storage, and Disposition This capability i ncludes assembly and disassembly of all warheads, including components and subsystems contained within a device. This encompasses the breadth of national security enterprise capabilities requiring special conduct of operations, equipment, facilities, and quality control. Disassembly, inspection, and disposition of the warhead, components, and subsystems requires similar special conduct of operations, equipment, and facilities. Storage of weapons and subsystems requires special safety and security process es and protocols. Testing Equipment Design and Fabrication Design and fabrication of special test equipment to simulate environmental and functional conditions ensure that products meet specifications. Data from test equipment provide evidence for qualification, certification, reliability, surety, and surveillanc e. Weapon Component and System Surveillance and Assessment Surveillance enhances integration across test regimes to demonstrate performance requirements for stockpile systems by inspections, laboratory and flight tests, nondestructive tests, and compone nt and material evaluations. Comparing data over time provides the ability to predict, detect, assess, and resolve aging trends and anomalous changes in the stockpile and address or mitigate issues or concerns. Assessment is the analysis, largely through modeling and simulation, of data gathered during surveillance to evaluate the safety, performance, and reliability of weapon systems and the effect of aging on performance, uncertainties, and margins. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page B-7 B.7 Transportation and Security The Transportation and Se curity area includes DOE/NNSA's capabilities for protecting the people, places, information, and other items and processes critical to the function of the nuclear security enterprise . Capability Definition Secure Transportation Protection and movement of nuclear weapons, weapon components, and SNM between facilities includes design and fabrication or modification of vehicles, design and fabrication of special communication systems, and training of Federal agents. Physical Security Physical security protects the Nation's nuclear materials, infrastructure assets, and workforce at DOE/NNSA sites involved in Weapons Activities. It protects assets from theft, diversion, sabotage, espionage, unauthorized access, comprom ise, and other hostile or noncompliant acts that may adversely affect national security, program continuity, and employee security. Information Technology and Cybersecurity Information technology and cybersecurity provides infrastructure and protection fo r both classified and unclassified computing networks, secure communications, applications, systems, and logical environments. It ensures electronic information and information assets are operating nominally and are protected from unauthorized access and malicious acts that would adversely affect national and economic security. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page C-1 Appendix C Workforce Retention The greatest asset of the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/ NNSA ) is the highly qualified and skilled world -class scientific and engineering workforce, without which DOE/NNSA could not meet its vital national security missions. The workforce simultaneously performs surveillance, warhead maintenance, technology explorat ion and maturation, research and development, supply chain management, and acquisition, among its modernization programs and other responsibilities. Given this workload, attracting and retaining the right talent is critical. This appendix provides the summary of human capital retention required in 50 U.S. Code \u00a7 2523 c(4) and includes an updated demographic snapshot (as of September 30, 2021) of the workforce across the nuclear security enterprise. A detailed discussion of the DOE/NNSA workforce is contai ned in Chapter 7 and Appendix D of the Fiscal Year 2022 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan (FY 2022 SSMP) . The nuclear security enterprise continues to grow its Federal and management and operating (M&O) partner workforce to meet mission requirement s. Like any large organization, DOE/NNSA faces challenges regarding its sizeable and diverse workforce. Some of these challenges, notably related to retention, are discussed below . C.1 Challenges and Approaches DOE/NNSA has made significant progress in hirin g, despite several retention challenges: Roughly a quarter of the current enterprise workforce is eligible to retire, and there will likely remain a significant retirement -eligible population for the near future. See Table C-1 for details. There is a shortage of U.S. citizens with science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) skill sets, posing a significant challenge to recruiting STEM personnel. DOE/NNSA sites compete with the private sector to recruit and retain personnel with highly valued STE M skills (e.g., computer science, electrical engineering, and other engineering and science fields). Given demand for these skills, qualified applicants can command significant salaries that may exceed the enterprise's ability to match. Nuclear security positions require extensive security screening and U.S. citizenship, further limiting the pool of potential applicants. DOE/NNSA has had continued mission success, despite impacts of the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID -19) pandemic. It remain s to be seen how the pandemic may continue to impact the enterprise. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page C-2 Table C-1. Federal and site percent retirement -eligible population as of September 30, 2021 Site % Retirement Eligible1 Federal (across all sites) 15 Los Alamos National Laboratory 38.8 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory 28.4 Sandia National Laboratories 19.2 Nevada National Security Site 28 Savannah River Site 16.8 Y-12 National Security Complex 27.4 Kansas City National Security Campus 14.2 Pantex Plant 22.2 On an enterprise level, DOE/NNSA 's workforce strategy team, with membership that spans NNSA Headquarters, laboratories , plants, and sites, collaborate s to find the best solutions to recruit and retain the current and future workforce. Partnership and collaboration will be essential to solving workforce challenges and maintaining the scientific and technical competencies that underpin DOE/NNSA's national security missions. NNSA Headquarters, site offices, and M&O partners support retention through a variety of programs: Critical skill retention programs to offer pay incentives for hard -to-fill critical positions and \"reengagement\" to attract and rehire recently separated critical talent Aggressive knowledge transfer programs to provide expertise to newer employees ( e.g., the Weapons Intern Program transfers detailed weapons and enterprise knowledge to future enterprise professionals) Employee leadership development programs, educational opportunities and assistance, and apprentice skill program involvement to encourage ca reer growth DOE/NNSA Site Directed Research and Development, Plant Directed Research and Development, and Laboratory Directed Research and Development funding to encourage new ideas Emphasis on employee engagement through career conversations, career development tools, workshops, and mentoring Rotational and promotional assignments to diversify experience ( e.g., detail assignments to other M&O partners or Federal sites) Improved University relations, partnerships, and scholarship programs Transition of many programs to a virtual environment when necessary and feasible to support teleworking and the greater impacts of COVID -19 Flexible work schedules to support family -friendly work/life options (networking groups, fitness classes, m eetups, etc.) NNSA Headquarters, site offices, and M&O partners are committed to attracting and retaining top talent. 1 The definition of \"retirement -eligible\" varies by location based on bargaining agreements, pension plans, and other factors. The differences in definition account for some of the variation between sites. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page C-3 C.2 Demographics (Snapshot as of September 30, 2021) As of September 30, 2021, the enterprise reported a headcount more than 51,0002 employees (Federal and M&O partner combined), with a net increase of 2,306 employees from the number reported in the FY 2022 SSMP. However, the enterprise must continue to hire aggressively to replace employee separations (i.e., retirement, voluntary, inv oluntary) . As shown in Figures C -1 and C-2, voluntary separations among early -career employees (age 35 and under), mid-career employees (ages 36-50), and those with 5 years of service or fewer remain a challenge . As shown in Figures C -3 and C-4, two-thirds of the FY 2021 workforce are early - and mid -career , and nearly half of the total workforce have 5 years of service or fewer . If current trends continue, the nuclear security enterprise will face challenges training these new hires and retaining the talented individuals it recruits. Figure C-1. Separation by age3 2 This number omits Support Service Contractors an d miscellaneous personnel not neatly incorporated into the Common Occupational Classification System categories. 3 Workforce data is site -specific. For instance, if a person voluntarily leaves one M&O partner to work at another M&O partner , that movement appears as a separation and a hire. Similarly, if a Federal employee leaves DOE/NNSA to work at another Federal agency, that appears as a voluntary separation.

HPC will support national security, economic prosperity, technological strength, and scientific and energy research leadership. Failure to apply HPC to national security, science, and growing big data needs will open the door for other nations with a demonstrated commitm ent to HPC investment to take the lead in several critical areas. Risk to U.S. leadership in high -end computing would increase , and could also eventually increase in science, national defense, energy innovation, and the commercial computing market. Figure D-1. Overview of the DOE/NNSA Exascale Computing Initiative The National Strategic Computing Initiative was established as a Federal interagency campaign in 2015 to maximize the benefits of HPC for U.S. economic competitiveness, scientific discovery, and national security. Other agencies with major responsibilities for the Initiative include the National Science Foundation, the Intelligence Community, and the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security. The National Strategic Computing Initiative 's major focus areas are the exploration and development of quantum computing, bio computing, and exascale computing. Within this initiative , the Department of Energy ( DOE ), represented by a partnership between the DOE Office of Science and DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/ NNSA ), has the lead responsibility for focusing and implementi ng the joint Exascale Comput ing Initiative. This initiative focuses on advanced simulation that Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page D-2 continues exploiting MOSFET1 technology to emphasize sustained HPC to advance DOE /NNSA missions . The objectives and the associated scientific challenges define a mission need for a comp uting capability of 2 to 10 exaFLOPS2 in the early to mid -2020s. D.1 Challenges To deliver the exascale computing capability for the nuclear security mission within the next decade while maintaining and modifying the integrated design codes (IDCs ), DOE/ NNSA w ill need to focus on six challenges : Develop ing HPC technologies and systems, in close partnership with computer vendors , that will provide at least an eight -fold increase in sustained application code performance over what is currently the largest NNSA supercomputer (a 125 -petaFLOPS3 system ). Address ing code performance on the current advanced architecture and next -generation systems, which employ heterogeneous architectures that are very different from the homogeneous computing environment DOE/NNSA has experienced in the past two decades . Advancing the Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) -funded laboratory and open -source software stack to run efficiently on the new advanced architecture s and to support emerging workflows . Developing prototype systems to assess the viability of alternate HPC architect ure paths for the ASC. Improving remote computing infrastructure to facilitate access across the DOE/NNSA complex to exascale and other leading -edge platforms wherever each may be sited . Moderniz ing DOE/ NNSA computing facilities to prepare them for siting future petascale and exascale platforms through increasing structural integrity, power, and cooling capabilities . D.2 Approaches and Strategies The U.S. Government has been interact ing with industry in HPC technology development to achieve DOE/NNSA's exascale goals. Past partnerships between the U.S. Government and industry have led to development of innovative technologies that met Federal and private sector objectives. DOE/ NNSA is continuing its partnership with the DOE Office of Science on the Exascale Computing Initiative , including investments in research and development (R&D) of hardware and systems technologies, software tools , and applications with computer vendors, the nationa l laboratories, and universities. In addition, the two organizations collaborated on the joint April 2018 CORAL -2 procurement, which will deliver one exascale -class system to the DOE Office of Science in fiscal year ( FY) 2021 -2022 and another to DOE/ NNSA in FY 2023. This joint procurement greatly supports the two organizations as they leverage each other's critical non -recurring engineering development costs and jointly manage the technical progress of the two exascale system projects . The FY 202 3 spend plan for Exascale Computing Initiative elements is delineated in Table D-1. In FY 2023, the DOE/ NNSA portion of the Exascale Computing Initiative spans across all six ASC program elements: 1 MOSFET stands for metal -oxide semiconductor, field -effect transistor. This technology , which has been the incumbent technology associated with Moore's law in microelectronics since the 1960s, theoretically begins failing significantly at spe eds faster tha n exascale speeds. 2 1 exaFLOPS = 1018 float ing-point operations per second . 3 1 petaFLOPS = 1015 floating -point operations per second.

This portion consists of the ECP Software Technology , in which ASC will make strategic investments in software technologies to directly support its IDC development requirements, where appropriate. Funding will support further development of compilers , math libraries , and programming models for the DOE/ NNSA suite of weapons codes that are aligned with the algorithms and approaches used in those codes. This focused research is needed to optimize the performance of the algorithms within the overall simulations that are the most time -demanding or require the highest precision control in numerical approximations. Investments also w ill be made in various performance analysis tools and visualization techniques to aid code developers and users to navigate the new advanced architecture systems Defense Application and Modeling - Next -Generation Application Development In FY 2021, DOE/ NNSA began transitioning the viable and validated ATDM next -generation code and associated capabilities into its Integrated Codes, Physics and Engineering Modeling, and Verification and Validation subprograms to support the annual assessment activities.

The Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration ( DOE/ NNSA ) monitor s the NIB through a framework consisting of four pillars (s upply chain, operations and facilities, logistics and transportation, workforce). DOE/ NNSA uses these pillars to identify the full scope of industrial base challenges to maintaining the nuclear stockpile, including those that are internal to the nuclear s ecurity enterprise, such as material production and workforce management, and external, such as vendor resiliency . The activities listed under the pillars in Figure F-1 indicate the types of activities that are considered when examining the NIB. Figure F-1. The nuclear security enterprise industrial base framework F.2 Risk Management Risk management is an area of increased attention across the nuclear security enterprise . Programs and sites within the enterprise employ varying methods to identify, characterize, monit or, and manage risks. These include efforts such as program -specific risk matrices; supply chain focused risk matrices that track Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration | April 2023 Fiscal Year 2023 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary | Page F-2 risks from raw material procurements through product acceptance; and implementation of supplier transparency software for a more proactive approach to supply chain risk management. There are also significant efforts underway to standardize the methods use d for risk management such as t he Supply Chain Risk Management Team that is working to standardize the methods used to identify, monitor, and respond to supply chain risks . The Supply Chain Risk Management Team supports larger DOE/ NNSA initiatives that ar e addressing all the pillars of the NIB to create an overarching process to make risk management practices more rigor ous. F.2.1 Monitoring The NIB is complex and multi -faceted; many diverse groups within the enterprise are monitoring and acting on industrial ba se issues that are specific to their own program s or activit ies. This necessarily narrow focus does not always offer a broad view of the industrial base picture. Therefore, as a part of a more centralized industrial base management focus , DOE/ NNSA levera ges its Integrated Planning Group to increase data sharing across the various program offices, working groups, and teams to increase coordination and collaboration and to gain more detailed insight concerning industrial base challenges . In addition, infor mation sharing occurs across the enterprise in areas such as risk management and issues related to the industrial base, as well as reciprocity of vendor qualifications to reduce the burden on vendors who do business with multiple lab oratorie s, plants, or s ites. F.2.2 Mitigation Within the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan - Biennial Plan Summary , each of the four NIB pillars are addressed in additional detail in their relevant sections along with actual or potential challenges (risks) and mitigation strat egies.

It is produced in nuclear reactors by the action of neutrons on lithium nuclei. uranium \u2014A naturally occurring radioactive, metallic element (symbol: U) that is found in the earth as a mineral ore. It has three primary isotopes: uranium -238, -235, and -234. It is a strategic material, with several uses related to nuclear weapons and therefore is critical to national security. uranium enrichm ent\u2014The process of increasing the concentration of the uranium -235 isotope in a sample of uranium by separating it from uranium -238. Verification and validation \u2014Independent procedures that are used together for checking that a product, service, or system meets requirements and specifications, and that it fulfills its intended purpose. For example, in the context of software testing, verification provides evidence of the correctness of computer codes in solving pertinent equations, while validation assesses the adequacy of the physical models used to represent reality. Verification and validation is also applied to nuclear weapons to ensure that they fulfill their intended function with sufficient precision to meet military and other specifications. W76 -1 LEP\u2014A life extension program for the W76 submarine -launched ballistic missile warhead, delivered by a Navy Trident II. W78 \u2014An intercontinental ballistic missile w arhead, delivered by an Air Force Minute Man III LGM -30. W80 -4 LEP\u2014A life extension program for the W80 warhead aboard a cruise missile, delivered by the Air Force B -52 bomber and future launch platforms . W88 \u2014A submarine -launched ballistic missile warhead , delivered a Navy Trident II. W88 Alt eration (Alt) 370\u2014An Alt of the W88 warhead to replace the arming, fuzing, and firing components and to refresh the conventional high explosive main charge . W87 -1\u2014An intercontinental ballistic missile warhead designed to replace the W78 and support the Air Force's ground -based strategic deterrent missile system planned to replace the Minuteman III. warhead \u2014The p art of a missile, projectile, torpedo, rocket, or other munition that contains either the nuclear or thermonuclear system intended to inflict damage. War Reserve \u2014Nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon material intended for use in the event of war. Weapons Activities \u2014Sustaining, modernizing, and dismantling nuclear weapons; maintaining and modernizing production operations; and optimizing the scientific tools underpinning these efforts. The term a lso refers to the portion of the NNSA budget covering these activities.
