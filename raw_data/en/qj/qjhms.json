Chinese Herbal Medicine For thousands of years, the practice of Chinese Medicine has explored and documented the qualities and effects a vast array of natural medicinal substances. The result is an extremely comprehensive compendium of individual herbs and their complex combinations with that treat all manner of illnesses and imbalances. Over the course of time these Chinese Herbal formulas have been refined to be highly effective without the risks that pharmaceuticals carry. Unlike western herbal therapy or pharmacology which usually involves products with only one substance, Chinese herbal formulas may contain a dozen or more ingredients carefully chosen for their ability to work together in a synergistic way. One herb may chosen to perform the primary function of the formula while 'assistant' herbs may be added to reinforce the primary action. Other ingredients may direct the action of the formula into a specific organ system or area of the body or make the formula more palatable. Finally, ingredients are added to counteract any negative effects of the primary ingredients. Is Chinese Herbal Medicine Right for Me? Chinese herbal medicines come in several forms. In the US the most common form is the 'tea pill', a small round pill thats just a little bigger than a BB. The tea pills are convenient and easy to swallow. Greater effectiveness may be achieved by using powdered herbs mixed with warm water or a concentrate of herbs in a tincture. The most effective form is the raw herbs themselves that must be prepared daily and taken as a tea. This method is the least used due to the amount of effort required to properly proceed the mixture and the sometimes unpleasant taste or smell of the preparation. How does it Actually Work? Chinese herbal medicine is part of an integrated system of primary health care, known as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that has an uninterrupted history of development dating back thousands of years in China and other parts of East Asia. Today's Chinese herbal medicines are manufactured to the highest standards and are subject to rigorous quality control procedures including individual batch testing to ensure that no contaminants are present and that the proper ratio of herbal constituents is correct. The companies that we purchase our herbal medicines from are based in the United States and use only the top quality raw herbs. Today, there are more than 450 substances commonly used in Chinese herbal medicine - most are of plant origin though some animal and mineral substances may also be used. You may find some in your kitchen, such as ginger, garlic and cinnamon, while others such as chrysanthemum and peony flowers, are more likely to be found in your garden! Many of the substances used will be unfamiliar to you and have names like chai hu (bupleurum), di huang (rehmannia), and huang qi (astragalus). Some substances that were used traditionally are no longer part of modern professional Chinese herbal medicine practice. For example, traditional remedies that are derived from endangered species have been replaced by other substances with similar actions. Chinese herbal medicines are prescribed either singly or made into formulae which take into account the individual therapeutic action of each herb and well as the effects when combined together. A well constructed formula maximises the effectiveness for treating a particular condition, while counteracting and minimising the unwanted effects of an individual herb. In addition to providing effective treatment for a wide range of health disorders, Chinese herbal medicine may also be used to assist with general health maintenance and disease prevention. By strengthening and enhancing normal body functions, the immune system is boosted and a general sense of well-being promoted.
