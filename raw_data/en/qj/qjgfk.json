The ELISA we developed was able to determine the antigen c ontent and was suitable for a potency test, and we described a relative potency assay method which determines the potency of test vaccines by comparing the ELISA value of a test vaccine to t hat of a reference vaccine. In the present study, we standardized the reference vaccine used for determ ining the potencies of test va ccines, and established a potency test by ELISA. We evaluated the proposed reference vaccine by the neutralizing antibody responses in dog s after vaccination, by the challenge protect ion test in guinea pigs (GP potency test), wh ich is the earlier official potency test used in Japan, and by the NIH potency test, which is widely used throughout the world. The results showed that a 4-fold dilution of the propo sed ref- erence vaccine induced sufficient immunity in dogs. A 3-fold dilution of the proposed reference vaccine passed the GP potency test. The international units (IU) calibrated by th e NIH potency test were 3.7 IU/dose. Fr om the results and the WHO recommendation that veterinary rabies vaccines should have a pote ncy of at least 1.0 IU/dose, we determin ed to dilute the proposed reference vaccin e by 3 fold and regarded it as the reference vaccine. Finally, we c onfirmed that there is a good agreement between the results of the potency test by ELISA and the results of the GP potency test. The establ ishment of the potency test by EL ISA has made it possible to m onitor the potency in the production process and has cont ributed to the stable production of the vaccine. KEY WORDS : ELISA, potency test, rabies vaccine. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 65(6): 685\u0096688, 2003 Japan has been free from rabies since 1957. Compulsory vaccination has played an important role in eradicating and controlling rabies. The Pharmaceutical Affairs Lawrequires that veterinary biologicals, including rabies vac- cines, be approved by the national authority in order to con- firm quality, safety and efficacy. The official potency testfor rabies vaccines for animal use in Japan had been a chal- lenge protection test on guinea pigs (GP potency test), a more advanced potency test than the NIH potency test [7],which is widely used throughout the world. In the GP potency test, a single vaccination by the subcutaneous route, the same as that used for dogs, is performed. The intramus-cular challenge route is similar to that of natural infection in the field, but this test still has several disadvantages; for example, it is time consuming, gives various results andrequires the use of many animals [1]. In vitro assays for quantification of the protective antigen in rabies vaccine are recommended by WHO as an alterna-tive potency test for a rabies vaccine [8]. Those assays do not take much time and enable determination of the quantity of the antigen in the production process. They are also bio-hazard-safe and do not violate animal welfare. We have been working on the development of an ELISA as a quick, sensitive and simple method to test the potency of rabiesvaccines. We previously reported that ELISA was suitable as a potency test for rabies vaccines [2]. The protective antigencontent in rabies vaccines and the ELISA value were dose- dependent, the dependence being linear. And the relation- ship between the protective antigen content in rabies vac-cines measured by the ELISA and the neutralizing antibody response in guinea pigs corresponding to the content of each antigen immunized was close. We then tried to establish a potency test by ELISA for determining potencies of test vaccines in comparison with a reference vaccine. We pr eviously reported a relative potency test method that involved two parallel tests with 3 doses by using a reference vaccine. The reference vaccine also ensures the reliability and reproducibility of theELISA. Since the Rabies Prevention Law in Japan requires that dogs be injected with ra bies vaccines every year, the prerequisite of the reference vaccine is an induction of suffi-cient immunity in the dog to last one year protecting against infection. Ishikawa and others [5] investigated the relation- ship between challenge protection and neutralizing antibod-ies induced by the vaccine and found that dogs with a neutralizing antibody titer of 10 or more were able to endure the challenge. Therefore, we evaluated the proposed refer-ence vaccine by the neutralizing antibody responses. In addition, the reference vaccine should pass the GP potency test and should meet the potency requirement recommendedby WHO [9]. MATERIALS AND METHODS Rabies vaccines : Rabies vaccines produced by six manu- facturers in Japan [5, 6] were examined in this study. Eachrabies vaccine was produced by a seed lot system. Briefly, the RC-HL strain [6] of rabies virus was propagated in HmLu cells at 34 \u00b0C for 5 days. The supernatant was con-K. GAMOH and inactivated with beta-propiolactone. The protein content has to be equal to or less than 0.1 mg/m l. Proposed reference vaccine : The proposed reference vac- cine, which is a freeze-dried vaccine derived from the RC- HL strain, was produced especially for use as the reference material and has a higher virus concentration than those ofcommercial vaccines. The proposed reference vaccine was dissolved in 6 m l of a diluent. ELISA : The ELISA technique was based on an antibody- binding method with a monoclonal antibody to the glyco- protein of the rabies virus as described previously [2]. This ELISA enables determination of the antigen content in the vaccine, which was found to be closely correlated with the ELISA value. Method for calculating relative potency : The potencies of test vaccines were determined by the relative potency assay, which involves two parallel assays with 3 doses by using thereference vaccine as described previously [3]. In this method, a relative potency (RP) of 0.683 or higher is regarded as a pass. Examination of neutralizing antibody response in dogs after vaccination : The immunogenicity of the proposed ref- erence vaccine in dogs was examined by neutralizing anti-body responses after vaccination. Eighty-seven dogs (2\u009621 month old) kept at six facilities that had never been injected with rabies vaccines were injected with dilutions of the pro-posed reference vaccine. The dogs were divided into 3 groups; those injected with undiluted proposed reference vaccine, those injected with the proposed reference vaccinediluted 2 fold, and those injected with the proposed refer- ence vaccine diluted 4 fold. Each dog was bled at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after vaccination, and the sera were stored at \u009620\u00b0C. The serum neutralizing antibody values were deter- mined by the indirect immunoperoxidase technique as described previously [4]. Anti-rabies virus guinea pigserum and peroxidase-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG rabbit sera were used as the first and the second sera, respectively. The neutralizing antibody values were expressed as thereciprocal of the serum dilution that inhibited coloration of more than 50% of the inoculated wells. NIH potency test : The NIH potency test was carried out by the standard method described by Seligmann [7]. Briefly, groups of mice were vaccinated twice with dilutions of the proposed reference vaccine one week apart. Oneweek after the second vaccination, the mice were challengedintracerebrally with the CVS strain of rabies virus contain- ing between 5 and 50 LD 50. The only mouse that died between the 5th and 14th days was considered to have died from rabies. The potency of the proposed reference vaccine was calculated to be a ratio of 50% effective dose (ED 50) of the proposed reference vaccine to that of 5th International Standard for Rabies Vaccine and is expressed in Interna- tional Units (IU). GP potency test : The GP potency test had been an offi- cial potency test for rabies vaccines for animal use in Japan until 1996. Ten guinea pigs were each inoculated subcuta-neously with 0.5 m l of the test vaccine (20-fold dilution) and 10 were used as a control group. Three weeks after the vac- cination, they were challeng ed with an intramasseteric injection of 10 LD 50/0.2 m l of the CVS strain of rabies virus. After observation for 2 weeks, the survival rate of the eachgroup was determined. Guinea pigs exhibiting signs of rabies infection were listed as dead. To pass the test, the survival rate has to exceed 70% in the test vaccine group andbe no more than 20% in the control group. The potencies of the proposed reference vaccine undiluted and diluted 2 fold, 3 fold and 4 fold were evaluated by the GP potency test toestimate the potency of the proposed reference vaccine. RESULTS Neutralizing antibody responses in the dogs after vacci- nation : The neutralizing antibody responses in the dogs are shown in Table 1. The neutralizing antibody titers rose drastically in the first month and then continued to fall grad- ually until the 12th month after vaccination. No significantdifferences between the titers in the three groups were found at any time point after vaccination. The geometric means of the neutralizing antibody titers in the dogs injected withundiluted, 2-fold-diluted and 4-fold-diluted proposed refer- ence were 12.1, 10.6 and 10.6, respectively. All the dilu- tions of the proposed reference vaccine were found toinduce sufficient immunity for at least 12 months after vac- cination, since the dogs with neutralizing antibody titers of 10 or more were able to endure the challenge as statedabove. NIH potency tests : NIH potency tests were carried out at four laboratories and were repeated twice or 3 times. Theresults of the tests are summari zed in Table 2. Based on the results, the IU of the proposed reference vaccine was 3.7. GP potency tests : The results of GP potency tests are summarized in Table 3. The group injected with the undi- Table 1.

Comparison of the results of potency test by ELISA with those of GP potency tests : Thirteen lots of rabies vaccines that had been applied for the national assay in 1996 wereused for both the potency test by ELISA and the GP potency test. As shown in Table 4, the results of the potency test by ELISA and GP potency tests were the same for 12 (92.3%)of the 13 lots.DISCUSSION The purpose of this study was to establish a reliable potency test by ELISA for a rabies vaccine for animal use in Japan. We previously reported that an ELISA we had devel-oped was suitable for a potency test, and we described a method for calculating the potency. In the present study, we standardized the reference vaccine used for determining thepotencies of test vaccines and for confirming the reliability and reproducibility of the test. We evaluated the proposed reference vaccine by three methods, i.e., by the neutralizingantibody responses in dogs after vaccination, by the GP potency test, which is the earlier official potency test used in Japan, and by the NIH potency test, which is widely usedthroughout the world. It was found that the propos ed reference vaccine either undiluted or diluted 2 fold or diluted 4 fold was able toinduce sufficient neutralizing antibodies for protection in dogs until at least 12 months after vaccination. The GP potency test indicated that the proposed reference vaccinediluted 3-fold was sufficient. The NIH potency test indi- cated that the IU of the proposed reference vaccine was 3.7 IU/dose. From these results and the WHO recommendationthat veterinary rabies vaccines should have a potency of at least 1.0 IU per dose [9], we decided to dilute the proposed reference vaccine by 3 fold and regarded it as the referencevaccine. Based on the results of this study, the reference vaccine was standardized and the potency test by ELISA was estab-lished as the official potency test in Japan in 1996, replacing the earlier official potency test, the GP potency test. Finally, we compared the results of the ELISA with those of the GP potency test. The results of the ELISA and GP potency test showed good agreement, but disagreement in the results was found in one lot, which passed the ELISA butnot by the GP potency test. Considering that both the RP by the potency test by ELISA and the potency by the GP potency test were close to the threshold, the disagreementseemed to come from wide vari ation in the results of the GP potency test.Table 2.

GAMOH ET AL. 688 The potency test established in this study is superior to challenge protection tests such as the NIH potency test andGP potency test in that there is only a small variation in test results, the use of animals is not required, a pathogenic live virus is not required, and a long period of time is notrequired. Therefore, this method enables control of the anti- gen content in the production process. This method should be useful for quality control of and stable production ofrabies vaccines.
