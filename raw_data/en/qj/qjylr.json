You lose a lot of body fluids in the form of sweat while you are exercising. If you do not take care of the problem on time, you can suffer from excessive [dehydration](https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/nutritional/dehydration). Hence to avoid this confusion, ensure that you sip liquid throughout your exercise. While water is the best drink for hydration, trying other options won't hurt. Along with body fluids, you also lose your body's [minerals](https://livpur.com/blogs/news/whats-in-your-sweat-how-to-replenish-lost-nutrients), such as potassium, sodium, and chloride. These minerals contribute to multiple body processes and must be adequately replenished. The mineral loss can also impact your cellular processes and muscle movement. It is particularly concerning for those working out for long hours, trying to build muscle, and following intense exercises. Also, [athletes](https://familydoctor.org/athletes-the-importance-of-good-hydration/) must continuously work on this mineral loss, or their overall activity gets significantly compromised. Related Article: [Here's How Hydration Supplements Supercharge Your Summer Workouts](https://www.dmoose.com/blogs/nutrition/how-hydration-supplements-supercharge-your-summer-workouts) Given the significance of the minerals in the body, water alone cannot help you in this. That is why trying [electrolytes drinks](https://quenchwater.com/blog/what-is-electrolyte-water-and-what-are-the-benefits/), energy drinks, and [intra-workout supplements](https://www.dmoose.com/products/intra-workout) are the best option. Such drinks also provide minerals and help you recover from the loss quickly. But often, these energy drinks contain a lot of sugar or other harmful substances that can interrupt your goals. That is why using homemade energy drinks to fuel your workout is essential. With the use of natural ingredients, these energy drinks help in recovering the electrolytes lost during exercise and give you the necessary boost to excel in your workouts. You can also enjoy the health benefits of the natural ingredients present in these energy drinks. It is essential to stay [hydrated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23899752/) during workouts, as it can overall affect your [performance](https://www.dmoose.com/blogs/nutrition/a-study-says-that-citrulline-supplementation-improves-blood-flow-exercise-performance). These six homemade energy drinks will be a great option to use in your workouts. 1. Banana Wheat Grass Wheatgrass, in all these years, has acquired a lot of fame due to its excellent benefits.
