Not only do we rely on a plethora of Ayurvedic remedies for our day to day problems, we also have non-allopathic cures that are gentle but effective. One such medicinal system that we trust is homeopathy. But not everyone is on board with this system of cure. While believers can't help but rave about how homeopathy has helped them; non-believers are quick to dismiss it as ineffective. In fact, there are many myths about homeopathy-which we are going to bust today. 1. How does homeopathy work? Homeopathy is based on the principle of Similia Similibus Curentur-like cures like. This means substances which can cause symptoms if taken in large doses, can be used in minute doses to treat similar symptoms. For example, drinking too much coffee can cause sleeplessness and agitation, so according to this principle, when made into a homeopathic medicine, it could be used to treat people suffering from sleeplessness and agitation. There is a large body of evidence from scientific research data, control clinical studies, and clinical outcome trials conducted by various molecular biologists, physicists, and nanotechnologists all around the world who have proven that homeopathy adopts a scientific method of treatment. 2. Does homeopathy just offer a placebo effect? Infants and children are often treated and cured of acute or chronic diseases. There is a complete section of veterinary homeopathy, wherein animals are treated and cured. In both the above cases of infants and animals-a psychological cure is not possible-as they are not aware of the mode of treatment. It is the impact of homeopathy medicines that helps their recovery. 3. Can homeopathy cure an ailment fast? You need to keep in mind two common factors that accurately determine the pace of recovery: time and severity of disease. Select Topics of your interest and let us customize your feed. Homoeopathy acts rapidly in acute conditions like infectious [diarrhoea](https://www.healthshots.com/health-news/cdc-updates-list-of-covid-19-symptoms-adds-runny-nose-and-diarrhoea/), fevers, and urticarial rashes to name a few instances. Unfortunately, people go to a homeopath as a last resort and by then the disease progresses quite a bit and sometimes goes from acute to chronic and the severity of the disease increases with time. So it is important that you see your homeopath sooner than later. Every medication needs to run its course to show its results. If homeopaths are a patient's last resort, then the patient needs to understand that the severity of their disease has increased in the lost time and the duration of treatment will be longer. 4. Does homeopathy require physical examination or pathological investigations? Investigations and examinations are definitely needed to assess the actual condition of the patient and form a part of the process of diagnosis and treatment.

Does it use steroids and/or heavy metals? This is one of the most commonly asked questions. In homoeopathy, there is no place for steroids. Since all source materials undergo a process of potentization and trituration, there won't be even a trace of crude metal element in it. Homoeopathic pharmacies have strict standardization and quality control systems. Homoeopathic pills show positive for steroid tests because a few plant extracts used in the medicines contain active principles where natural steroid content is present. Also, homeopathy is known to work rapidly in many acute ailments bringing exceptional results. Countless cases of this nature have been recorded where the medicine has reacted in time while healing the patient. It is a common mindset that steroids work super-fast. Hence rapid cures of conditions not having responded to other systems of medicines are often doubted or attributed to malpractice of misusing steroids. 6. Can homeopathy be combined with other systems of medicine? Around 60% of patients who approach homoeopaths are already consuming some or the other medicines for different ailments like [diabetes](https://www.healthshots.com/healthy-eating/superfoods/jamun-is-the-miracle-fruit-for-people-with-type-2-diabetes-heres-why/), hypertension, and so on. So, homeopathy medicines can safely be given along with any other branch of medicine. Homeopathy goes hand in hand with other systems of medicines like Ayurveda, Unani, naturopathy, and allopathy. If there are any overlaps, the consulting homoeopathic doctor will give the patient instructions on the time difference that should be maintained between the consumption of the two medicines. 7. Do I need to follow a particular diet while consuming homeopathic medicines? There is no such diet restriction in homeopathy; however dietary changes may be applicable depending on the nature of disease the patient is suffering from. Restrictions always come as general management to particular disease conditions.

Can homeopathy medicines treat serious or advanced medical conditions? Homeopaths treat various conditions which can be both acute and chronic. Today homeopaths work with different kinds of cases ranging from the common cold and cancer to psychiatric illnesses. Based on the severity and pathological changes, homeopaths guide the patients whether to take medication or to go for surgery. Every homeopath is well aware of the scope and limitations of his medication. 9. Is it safe to self-medicate homeopathic medicines? This notion is extremely incorrect. Every homeopathic medicine has a wide range of action and application. So, if one simply knows the names of a few drugs and does not understand its course of action and dosage it is absolutely not advisable to medicate yourself. Always consult a homeopathic physician and get the right course of treatment.
