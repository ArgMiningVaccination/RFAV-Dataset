Purdue, which opened its doors on September 16, 1874, with a student body of 39 and a staff of six, has grown into a world- class educational system of 69,600 students and about 18,400 faculty and staff members across Indiana. The West Lafayette campus comprises 39,200 students and nearly 15,000 faculty and staff members. Purdue graduates have been to the moon, to the highest levels of business and government, and to Sweden to receive the Nobel Prize. The roster of about 384,000 living alumni includes noted CEOs, agriculturalists, scientists, teach - ers, engineers, pharmacists, journalists, veteri - narians, and athletes who have made notable contributions to our society. Purdue has been a vital resource to the peo - ple of Indiana, the nation, and the world \u2014 from its land-grant foundation to its status today as a prominent land-, sea-, and space-grant uni - versity that champions its missions of learning, discovery, and engagement. Making higher education available to the people was the plan in 1862 when President Lincoln signed the Morrill Act. That act gave public lands to any state that would use proceeds from the sale of the land to support a college that would teach agriculture and the mechanic arts. Three years after passage of the land-grant act, the Indiana General Assembly voted to take advantage of the provisions. Competition among various areas of the state culminated in 1869 when the assembly accepted $150,000 from Lafayette civic leader John Purdue, $50,000 from Tippecanoe County, and 100 acres of land from local citizens. In appreciation, the insti - tution was named Purdue University and was established in West Lafayette. The University officially opened for classes September 16, 1874. Purdue quickly established prominence in agriculture and engineering, answering the immediate needs of the people. And it has since built solid reputations in veterinary medicine, technology, a range of sciences, pharmacy, nurs - ing, management, liberal arts, health sciences, education, and consumer and family sciences. The physical growth of campus also has been dramatic. Originally the campus consisted of three buildings rising out of Indiana farm -land. Today the main campus encompasses 160 major buildings. Nearly $600 million worth of new construction and renovation is under way or scheduled to occur at Purdue in West Lafay - ette during the first seven years of the new millennium. The Purdue system has expanded to include Purdue campuses at Fort Wayne, Hammond, and Westville, and degree programs at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and Indiana University-Purdue University Colum - bus. Purdue's College of Technology exists in 10 Indiana communities in addition to the West Lafayette campus. The mission of answering the people's needs goes beyond educating productive graduate and undergraduate students. Purdue is a highly respected research institution, with research and sponsored program expenditures of over $395.9 million in the 2004-05 fiscal year on the West Lafayette campus. In addition, the Univer - sity offers its expertise to the state of Indiana in numerous ways, as well as to business and industry, retailers, and teachers. Purdue's impact in Indiana is evident daily through its spectrum of learning, discovery, and engagement. The University has an annual impact of more than $2.9 billion on Indiana's economy. Purdue's march toward preeminence has solid footing in the development of Discov - ery Park, where the University's talent and ideas are pacesetters in interdisciplinary, world-lead - ing nanotechnology and biosciences research and discovery. Outreach programs include the Purdue Uni - versity Cooperative Extension Service, with sites in each of Indiana's 92 counties serving as a gateway to lifelong learning. The Office for Continuing Education and Conferences serves tens of thousands of adult learners annually through Purdue courses for personal and pro - fessional development offered on campus, off campus, and by distance education. Purdue is also a cultural and recreational hub for people in northwestern Indiana. The Edward C. Elliott Hall of Music, one of the largest pro - scenium theaters in the world, houses 6,025 spectators for music, dance, theatre, and pop entertainment. Boilermaker fans crowd Ross- Ade Stadium, Mackey Arena, and the Intercol - legiate Athletic Facility for Big Ten Conference football, basketball, and volleyball. About Purdue University \u0018Purdue University ranks among the 25 larg - est universities in the United States. Its posi - tion of leadership and influence in teaching and research stems in large part from its worldwide acclaim in engineering, science, and technology, but its preeminence is bolstered by an excit - ing array of academic disciplines.

College of Liberal Arts Organization and Purpose The College of Liberal Arts consists of 11 departments: communication; English; foreign languages and sciences; anthro - pology; speech, language, and hearing sciences; and visual and performing arts. The college offers a variety of programs designed to prepare you for continued intel - lectual growth and to provide specialized train - ing in many areas. In order to prepare yourself properly for the challenge of adult life, you will find in the college's programs a broad range of curricula carefully planned to develop your capacities, abilities, and skills. As our society becomes increasingly com - plex with continued reliance on skill and knowl - edge, we are confronted by the necessity for better understanding and communication among the various segments of society. Scientists, engineers, physicians, artists, lawyers, and pub - lic officials must speak to each other in terms mutually comprehensible if the values of their specialties are to be transmitted into plans for action. Knowledge of the humanities with their emphasis on the individual, society, and their goals; of the social sciences with their analysis of our attempt to understand and guide society; and of education with its emphasis on trans - mission of accumulated knowledge from one generation to the next plays a central role in facilitating communication among the parts of our society. Such knowledge involves balance, tolerance for all facets of knowledge, respect for all useful skills and techniques, and above all, the understanding of ourselves and others. Curricula leading to two degrees are offered by the College of Liberal Arts: Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Bachelor of Science (B.S.). Specific offerings of these curricula and the requirements for degrees are listed in the appropriate sections of this bulletin. Both introductory and advanced work are offered in the fields associated with the 11 departments of the college.

Your first inquiry concerning admission should include (1) the amount of education you have completed; (2) your plans for fur - ther education, indicating your area of interest; and (3) the approximate date of your entrance to Purdue. When you are entering directly from high school, the Office of Admissions suggests that you file your application for admission early in your senior year. Transfer students should apply as early as possible. Campus Visits A visit to the campus and an interview with an admissions counselor will help you determine which educational programs at Purdue are in keeping with your educational background and your future career interests. Such a campus visit is especially appropriate during your junior year in high school. The Office of Admissions is open each week - day from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. No appointment is necessary; however, if you would like a tour of the campus, contact the Office of Admissions before your visit. Students interested in Purdue have a variety of opportunities to visit the campus. Some programs, such as Fall Preview Days and Introducing Purdue, offer more formal agendas that include admissions presentations, school and program sessions, and campus tours. Prospective students and their families also can make individual visits; the Office of Admis - sions offers multiple visit sessions on a daily basis, Monday through Friday, including walk - ing tours of campus. Students planning a visit to campus should first contact the Office of Admis - sions or visit the Admissions Web site \u2014 www. purdue.edu/Admissions/Undergrad \u2014 for fur - ther information. Core 40 \u2014 Indiana Students Purdue University applauds the state's efforts to strengthen Indiana's high school students' aca - demic preparation and encourages all students to complete the Core 40 requirements. In addi - tion to considering high school courses, Purdue will continue to use other factors such as grade point average, class rank, trends in achievement, honors courses, and test scores when reviewing applications for admissions. We will evaluate applicants on an individual basis and in relation to their requested majors. Program limitations also will continue to be a factor in admission to certain majors.12 Liberal ArtsAdmissions Criteria Your admission as a new student into the College of Liberal Arts at Purdue is determined by a holistic review that evaluates rank in class, test scores, ability to be successful, grade aver - age in college preparatory subjects, grades in courses related to the degree objective, trends in achievement, completion of minimum high school subject matter expectations (see table), the strength of the college preparatory program, personal attributes, and information provided by your high school counselor. All applicants who have not completed a full year of college work are required to provide SAT or ACT scores (including the writing sections of these tests). Students are encouraged to take either the SAT or ACT in the spring of their junior year. All applicants must graduate high school or have a GED. Minimum Subjects Semester Expectations English 8 Academic math* 6 Laboratory science 4 Foreign language 4 * Includes algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, etc. Includes biology, chemistry, physics, earth/space sciences, physiology/anatomy, etc. Because this catalog is used for two to three years, you should refer to www.purdue.edu/ Admissions/Undergrad for the most current and accurate information about admission to the Col - lege of Liberal Arts. Advance Deposit on Fees If you are a new student admitted for the fall semester, you must make a nonrefundable advance deposit of $100. This deposit is to reserve a place for you on the new student ros - ter. Students admitted on or before April 10 must submit the deposit by May 1. Those admitted after April 10 must submit the deposit within three weeks (21 days) after the date of the offer of admission. If you receive an offer of admission but fail to make the required deposit of $100 within the time allotted, you automatically forfeit your right to a place on the new student roster. The $100 advance deposit will be applied to your first semester fees and is not associ - ated with your University housing application or contract.Early Enrollment for Superior Students If you are a high school student with a highly superior scholastic record during the first three years of high school, you may qualify for admis - sion to Purdue without high school graduation. The regular entrance requirements are sup - plemented by certain objective measurements of your qualification to advance to the university level. In this way, the University tries to recog - nize and provide for individual rates of learning and achievement. As a nongraduate of high school, you will be considered for admission if you (1) have earned 12 or more credits toward graduation; (2) have a highly superior school record; (3) are strongly recommended by your principal; (4) have the approval of your parents for college entrance without high school graduation; (5) qualify by your performance on prescribed admissions tests; and (6) are approved by the University Admissions Committee. Purdue cannot guarantee high school diplo - mas under this arrangement, but it cooperates with whatever arrangement the state or local school system may have for awarding a high school diploma to a successful participant in this plan. Admission with Advanced Standing On the basis of your CEEB Advanced Placement Examination, Purdue advanced credit examina - tion, or high school record, you, as a first-year student, may receive advanced credit and/or advanced placement. Dean's Scholar Program In addition to a financial award of $1,000, this program offers a select group of students the opportunity to pursue personal academic inter - ests with a professor in one of the college's various departments. An applicant is required to have a combined SAT score of 1200 (math and verbal) or an ACT composite of 26 or be the valedictorian or salutatorian of his or her high school graduating class. Applications are avail - able from the College of Liberal Arts Honors Office, Beering Hall, and are due on February 1 before the entering student's fall semester. Admissions 13Transfer Students If you are transferring from another college or university, you must comply with the following procedures: 1. Submit an official undergraduate application for admission. 2. Forward official transcripts of work done at institutions previously attended (both high school and college). A separate transcript must be provided by each institution, regardless of whether credit is requested. To be considered for admission, transfer stu - dents should apply as soon as possible for the term they wish to enter. To be admitted, students must have the necessary grade point average at the time they apply (and any required college coursework) and meet high school subject mat - ter requirements. No more than 25 percent of the courses (credit hours) fulfilling major, concentration, or area requirements may be completed at another college or university. Because this catalog is used for two to three years, you should refer to www.purdue. edu/Admissions/Undergrad for the most current and accurate information about admission to the College of Liberal Arts. Transfer (or Advanced) Credit Credit for courses at Purdue University will be given for work of equivalent character and amount successfully completed at another accredited college. Advanced standing will be determined on the basis of these credits. Advanced credit will be regarded as provisional and may be withdrawn by the director of admis - sions upon recommendation of the head of the department concerned if dependent work is not satisfactorily completed. Purdue University is a supporter of and a participant in the Indiana Core Transfer Library (CTL), a growing list of courses that will transfer from one public Indiana institution to another. As the Core Transfer Library is devel - oped, information will be available at www.che. state.in.us. When credit earned at another college or university is transferred to Purdue and accepted toward advanced standing, the credit is con - verted into terms of Purdue courses and applied to the program of study. It remains for you, the student, to complete the program, and your schedule of courses each term will be adjusted accordingly. It does not follow that your clas - sification at Purdue or the time necessary for completion of the required work for a degree will be in line with what was expected at the previous institution. Grades are not transferred; only credits in courses are recorded. Students participating in college-credit courses taught concurrently for high school and college credit during the regular school day by local high school teachers must validate the credit by submitting satisfactory results on the College Board Advanced Placement Examina - tion or the Purdue advanced credit examination, as determined by the subject department. The determination of use of transfer credit in part or in full to satisfy graduation requirements is the responsibility of the school head or his or her designated representative, in accordance with the regulations of the University faculty. All credentials are submitted with the under - standing that they become the property of Pur - due University. Early Registration \u2014 Day on Campus The Student Access, Transition and Success Programs (SATS) and the Office of Admissions invite you to campus for one day of early reg - istration during the summer before your first semester as a new student. This day is set aside for you to meet with your academic counselor and to select your first-semester classes. The University then will proceed with the registra - tion process and mail you a fee statement and your class schedule. Student Orientation and Support Programs Student Access, Transition and Success Pro - grams (SATS) is responsible for the coordination of initiatives that help students prepare for, tran - sition into, and succeed in Purdue University's academically rigorous environment.

Expenses The cost of attending Purdue University var - ies, depending on a variety of factors, including where a student chooses to live; travel expenses; food costs; enrollment in a special program; date of entry; the college or school in which you are enrolled; etc. Basic minimum costs for the two-semester 2006-07 school year on the West Lafayette campus are shown in the following table. Some academic programs may have addi - tional fees. Contact the department if you have questions. 2006-07 Estimated Costs West Lafayette Campus (Fall and Spring Semesters) Items Indiana Resident Nonresident Tuition/Fees $6,846* $21,016* Room/Board 7,140 1,650 Total $16,896 $31,216 * First-time students enrolled at the West Lafayette campus beginning in the Fall 2002 Semester and thereafter pay these fees. Undergraduate, graduate, and professional students who were enrolled as degree-seeking students in the Spring 2002 Semester on the West Lafayette campus may be eligible for a lower fee. To main - tain eligibility for a lower fee, students must be continuously enrolled (Fall and Spring semesters); eligible students will pay a lower fee until the date of attainment of one degree or until the Fall 2007 Semester, which - ever comes first. Beginning in the Fall 2006 Semester, students who enroll for a new degree-seeking program will be assessed a campus repair and rehabilitation fee. That fee, as approved by the Board of Trustees, is also retroactive for students who enrolled as new degree-seeking students in Summer 2006. Your budget can vary, depending on your state of residence and the type of housing and academic program you select. Some programs have additional fees: Engineering, $600; Management, $936; Flight, individual courses in the program have additional fees that can be reviewed at www.purdue.edu/bursar or by contacting the Department of Aviation Technology. International students pay an additional $50 per semester. Rates and refund schedules are subject to change without published notice. Expenses 1\u0018Full-time students are charged a general ser - vice fee, a technology fee, and a repair and reha - bilitation fee. The general service fee provides students with access to a variety of services and privileges such as access to the Recreational Sports Center and the Boilermaker Aquatic Center for recreational sports activities. It also allows deep-discount ticket prices for most Con - vocations-sponsored events and for Intercolle - giate Athletics contests with presentation of a student ID card. With payment of full fees, students have access to the Purdue Student Health Center that covers medical clinical office visits, nutrition consultations, health education services, and a limited number of sessions for psychological counseling. Additional fees are charged for lab, x-ray, urgent care, physical therapy, and other services. The technology fee is used to enhance stu - dent access to the campus networks, computer laboratories, and electronic access to informa - tion and databases. Technology fee funds are used to equip classrooms with computer and video projection equipment. Beginning in the Fall 2006 Semester, stu - dents who enroll for a new degree-seeking pro - gram will be assessed a repair and rehabilitation fee. (The fee is retroactive for students who were enrolled as new degree-seeking students in Sum - mer 2006.) This fee is assessed to address main - tenance funding for buildings and infrastructure on campus, and funds received from the fee will be dedicated to building and infrastructural needs. The establishment of the fee is a result of growing unfunded needs to address critical building and infrastructural upkeep. Miscellaneous personal expenses include such items as clothing, transportation, telephone, news -papers and magazines, dry cleaning and laundry, entertainment, etc. Refunding of Fees and Tuition Registered students who find it necessary to cancel their registration before the beginning of classes, upon the recommendation of the registrar, will receive a 100 percent refund of all fees and tuition.

Withdrawal during the fifth or sixth week, 40 percent refund No portion of the technology, repair and rehabilita - tion fees, or academic building facilities fee will be refunded once classes begin. Title IV Aid Once classes begin, refunds are prorated based on the date of withdrawal from class(es). Refunds are based on a diminishing scale through 60 percent of the semester. Refunds are calculated on all fees and tuition. Summer Modules Refunds for summer modules are proportionate on the same basis as semester refunds. Financial Aid Purdue University recognizes that not all students and their parents can afford to finance a college education entirely from their income and assets. To ensure that all students have an opportunity to obtain a college education regardless of their financial circumstances, the University, through the Division of Financial Aid, administers a four - fold program of scholarships, grants, employment opportunities, and loans. The Purdue University Division of Financial Aid administers federal, state, and University financial assistance programs. These programs require students to have a high school diploma or GED. Information regarding the GED is avail - able through any public high school or any state department of education/public instruction. Most types of aid are based upon financial need and satisfactory academic progress. To be considered for all types of financial aid, you must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This form should be submitted online at www.fafsa.ed.gov or can be obtained from 1\u0018 Liberal Artsthe Division of Financial Aid; Schleman Hall of Student Services, Room 305; 475 Stadium Mall Drive; West Lafayette, IN 47907-2050. You should apply early for Purdue University financial aid. Eligible FAFSAs postmarked by March 1 will receive preference in the awarding of aid. You are welcome to visit the campus to dis - cuss not only family budgeting in order to meet college expenses, but also the types of available aid and the application procedure. Walk-in counselors are available from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, and from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. on Thursday. Phone counselors are available from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday at (765) 494-0998.

An RA devotes approximately 20 hours each week to his or her duties in this capacity, with most of the time scheduled during evenings and week - ends. Compensation for an RA position includes reduced tuition, room and board, and a small stipend. Applications and additional information for those interested in becoming a resident assis - tant can be found at www.housing.purdue.edu. Living Accommodations University housing facilities and programs are available to all students based on Purdue's pol - icy of equal opportunity regardless of national origin, race, or religion. It is the University's desire and expectation that all others providing housing or services to Purdue students will do so in a manner consistent with this policy. How - ever, the University does not approve or disap - prove specific housing accommodations since it believes that the choice of housing rests with you, the student. As a Purdue student, you have a variety of choices when it comes to choosing your new home while attending school. You can live in one of 14 University Residences, a fraternity or soror - ity house, cooperative housing, or in a privately operated facility within the local community. Apply for housing as soon as possible \u2014 whether or not you've made a final decision about enrolling at Purdue. University Residences begins accepting applications from admitted stu - dents in September for the following academic year. Housing assignments generally are made in the order in which applications and $75 housing deposits are received, after housing assignments are made for certain groups such as Learning Communities and National Merit Finalists. Therefore, you should apply for housing as soon as possible to improve your chance of assign - ment to a residence of your higher preference. You will have the opportunity to indicate your housing preferences and a specific roommate request at the time you receive your housing contract mailing. Apply online at www.housing.purdue. edu to expedite your application. If you don't have Internet access, use the paper application included with the housing brochure in your initial admission packet. With your application, you will be required to submit a $75 deposit. If you do decide to live on campus, this deposit will be credited to your first housing bill; if you do not, the deposit is refundable per the schedule below. March 1 is the preferential housing applica - tion deadline. Because the University does not guarantee on-campus housing, it is important that students meet this deadline, although apply - ing earlier is recommended. Students who apply for housing after the March 1 deadline will be assigned to a residence if space is available. First-year students are not required to live on campus. Students who apply for housing by March 1 receive a housing contract mailing by April 1, which will be due to be returned by mid-April. When you receive your housing contract mail - ing, you will be prompted to fill out an online preference form, which will be used to assign your residence and match you with a compatible roommate. If you want to live with a friend, each of you must rank your residence preferences the same and request each other as a roommate. Living Accommodations 1\u0018New students who notify University Residences in writing of their choice to cancel their housing application will receive a refund of the housing deposit as follows: Fall semester or summer session, cancellation received: Before May 1, $75 refund Between May 1 and May 31, $25 refund On or after June 1, no refund Spring semester, cancellation received: Before December 1, $25 refund On or after December 1, no refund The Office of the Dean of Students offers assistance to students seeking off-campus hous - ing.

Through Purdue's membership in the center, faculty and graduate students are assured of fast access to this material through the Interli - brary Loan Office in the Humanities, Social Sci - ence, and Education (HSSE) Library in Stewart Center. The library collections and services of the Big Ten libraries, the University of Chicago, Ball State University, and Indiana State Uni -versity also are available to Purdue students and faculty under cooperative agreements. Individuals who wish to use these facilities are encouraged to contact Circulation Services in the HSSE Library. The Digital Learning Collaboratory (DLC) is located in the Undergraduate Library. It is a joint initiative of the Purdue Libraries and Informa - tion Technology at Purdue. The DLC supports student learning through access to state-of-the- art hardware and software for creating multi - media projects in individual, group work, and instructional settings. It facilitates the integra - tion of information and technology literacy into the undergraduate curriculum. For students in the College of Liberal Arts, the subject collections of the Humanities, Social Science, and Education Library will provide most of the materials for study and research. This library is particularly attuned to the needs of upper-level undergraduate students, provid - ing a book collection of over 765,000 volumes and 3,000 current journals. Its resources include a reference collection of over 30,000 volumes, an extensive collection of older scholarly mate - rials on microform, depository collections of United States and United Nations documents, and access to a wide range of electronic infor - mation sources.

Study Abroad The Office of Programs for Study Abroad is ded - icated to internationalizing Purdue by helping as many students as possible have overseas experi - ences that enrich lives, enhance academic expe - riences, and increase career potential. The office helps students overcome academic, financial, or personal concerns that might prevent them from going abroad, and is especially devoted to removing obstacles for first-time travelers. Purdue offers more than 200 study abroad and internship programs in dozens of countries, lasting from a week to a year, for all majors. Most programs do not require foreign language skills. Program costs vary, but many are com - parable to the cost of studying at Purdue (with the exception of the travel expense). Participants earn Purdue grades and credits, so those who study abroad can graduate in the normal length of time. Most of the financial aid that covers Purdue expenses can also be applied to study abroad, and more financial aid specifically for study abroad has been available in recent years. Students who have taken part in study abroad often describe their experiences as \"life chang - Study Abroad 2\u0018The requirements for the baccalaureate degree are listed in the General Information bulletin of the University. One of these requirements is the certification by the dean of the appropriate college or school that students have completed their plans of study. Attainment of the objectives of the College of Liberal Arts is sought in two ways. One is through the specialized knowledge students acquire as they major or minor in one or more of the subject matters offered by the departments in the college. The other is through the opportunity to gain skill and knowledge in other areas of learning through a combination of requirements and free electives.ing,\" \"eye opening,\" and \"the best choice I ever made.\" Students should begin their international exploration either online at www.studyabroad.purdue.edu, by calling (765) 494-2383, or by contacting The Office of Programs for Study Abroad; Young Hall, Room 105; 302 Wood Street; West Lafayette, IN 47907-2108. Special Programs Honors Program The College of Liberal Arts Honors Program is designed to provide excellent students with enriched, individualized, unusual educational opportunities. Students who qualify for the program have the opportunity to engage in advanced work with individual professors and to take special courses with limited enrollments available only to honors students. They also are permitted to make special arrangements in conjunction with regularly offered courses that will enhance the particular educational experi - ence. The college works with honors students to discover the most imaginative, exciting, and intellectually challenging education available for them within the liberal arts at Purdue. To qualify for the program, entering students need to have an SAT score of 1200 (math and verbal) or higher, an ACT score of 26 or higher, or be in the upper 10 percent of their graduating class. To graduate with honors in Liberal Arts, a student must take at least eight honors courses during the undergraduate career. But the honors experience at Purdue involves numerous activities beyond the class - room. Honors students are given the oppor - tunity to meet leading professors at special luncheons, to talk with visiting speakers from other universities and outside institutions, and to participate in the annual Honors Colloquium. The College of Liberal Arts wants honors students to develop strong, confident, inquiring minds. To do that, the program moves beyond the classroom. Much of what is of interest for the future is not discussed in the classroom. By introducing students to men and women shaping the future and aware of the limitations of current knowledge, the college helps students to move beyond the ordinary constraints of learning and gain a vision of that future.

Health and Kinesiology Athletic Training Concentration The Purdue University undergraduate athletic training education program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Train - ing Education (CAATE). The primary goals of the program are to prepare students for gradua - tion, to prepare them to take the National Ath - letic Trainers Association Board of Certification (NATABOC) certification examination, to pro - vide them with the skills to pursue graduate or professional school (physical therapy, occupa - tional therapy, physician's assistant, etc.), and to prepare them for potential employment as an entry-level athletic trainer. The program leading to the Bachelor of Sci - ence degree via the Athletic Training Education Program includes one year of pre-athletic train - ing, a selection process, and three years in the athletic training major. Because of enrollment limitations, students who have completed the pre-athletic training year at Purdue cannot be assured of admission to the athletic training major. As a professional program, the depart - ment reserves the right to select students it feels are qualified to enter the profession of athletic training. Students who are not admitted to the athletic training major may select a new major within the Department of Health and Kinesiology, transfer to another department within the Col - lege of Liberal Arts, or transfer to another col - lege or school within the University. A formal application for admission to the athletic training major must be completed and submitted during the second semester of the pre- athletic training year. The professional program takes a minimum of three years to complete. Selection of students to enter the athletic training program is based upon many factors including: 1. GPA during the pre-athletic training year. The minimum grade point average for applica - tion to the program is 2.75 on a 4.0 scale. 2. Individual grades. The committee will be look - ing for grades of B-minus or better in BIOL 203, 204; MA 159 (or MA 153 and 154); PSY 120; HK 101, 208: and ENGL 106. 3. Professional staff evaluation. The athletic training staff will rank each student based on the clinical experience of the pre-professional year. The evaluators will consider: Ability to learn clinical skills as determined by practical exams. Ability to apply classroom knowledge to the clinical setting. Health and Kinesiology/Plans \u00183 Ability to work within the policies and proce - dures of the various clinical settings. Ability to work with the patient/athlete on a professional basis. Ability to work in a stress-filled environ - ment. 4. Personal interview. Questions in the personal interview are intended to derive information about the student's athletic training, personal, and academic background. In addition, it is intended to seek out information about the student's career intentions. The questions will determine how much the student knows about athletic training. One-on-one interaction, essen - tial to athletic training, will be assessed also. 5. Letters of recommendation. Three letters of recommendation should be related to the appli - cant's ability to function in an allied medical setting, i.e. patient-athletic trainer relationship. The letter should detail the applicant's person - ality and work habits as they would pertain to a career in athletic training. These letters will not be scored but are required as part of the application process. 6. Written essay. Each student will write an in- class essay. These essays will give insight about the students' written communication skills and their general knowledge. Technical Standards for Admission The Athletic Training Education Program at Pur - due University is a rigorous and intense program that places specific requirements and demands on the enrolled students. An objective of this program is to prepare graduates to enter a variety of employment settings and to render care to a wide spectrum of individuals engaged in physical activity. The technical standards set forth by the Ath - letic Training Education Program establish the essential qualities considered necessary for stu - dents admitted to this program to achieve the knowledge, skills, and competencies of an entry- level athletic trainer as well as meet the expecta - tions of the program's accrediting agency, the CAAHEP. All students admitted to the Athletic Train - ing Education Program must have the abilities and meet the expectations outlined here. In the event that a student is unable to fulfill these technical standards, with or without reasonable accommodation, the student will not be allowed to continue in the program. Compliance with the program's technical standards does not guaran -tee a student's eligibility for the NATABOC certification exam. Candidates for selection to the Sports Medi - cine and Athletic Training Education Program must demonstrate: 1. The ability to assimilate, analyze, synthesize, integrate concepts, and problem solve to for - mulate assessment and therapeutic judgments and to be able to distinguish deviations from the norm. 2. Sufficient postural and neuromuscular control, sensory function, and coordination to per - form appropriate physical examinations using accepted techniques; and accurately, safely, and efficiently use equipment and materials during the assessment and treatment of patients. 3. The ability to communicate effectively and sen - sitively with patients and colleagues, including individuals from different cultural and social backgrounds; this includes, but is not limited to, the ability to establish rapport with patients and communicate judgments and treatment infor - mation effectively. Students must be able to understand and speak the English language at a level consistent with competent professional practice. 4. The ability to record the physical examina - tion results and a treatment plan clearly and accurately. 5. The capacity to maintain composure and con - tinue to function well during periods of high stress. 6. The perseverance, diligence, and commitment to complete the athletic training education pro - gram as outlined and sequenced. 7. Flexibility and the ability to adjust to changing situations and uncertainty in clinical situations. 8. Affective skills and appropriate demeanor and rapport that relate to professional education and quality patient care. Candidates for selection to the Athletic Training Educational Program will be required to verify that they understand and meet these technical standards, with or without reasonable accommo - dations.

Designed for students majoring in any discipline, the courses on Asia offer an invalu - able supplement for students anticipating profes - sional employment requiring a basic knowledge of an Asian language and culture. The founda - tion provided by the courses in language, social science, and the humanities also will prepare students for advanced study in the Asian field. This interdisciplinary program offers an undergraduate major and an undergraduate minor that includes both a language and cultural component. Each student is expected to com -plete Level IV in either the Chinese or Japanese language. The minor requires four additional cultural or area courses (12 credit hours) that should be dis - tributed between a selection from at least two of the following disciplines: history, philosophy, political science, and literature (offered in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures). The major requires a survey course from a selection (3 credit hours), and seven additional courses (21 credit hours) from a selection. No more than five of the courses chosen to fulfill the requirements may be in any one discipline. At least one course must be at the 400 level or higher.

Courses offered include ancient Greek and Latin language and literature (includ - ing literature in translation), ancient history, phi - losophy, mythology, and art. The wide range of course offerings gives some sense of the breadth of interests comprised by classics, the study of Greek and Roman antiquity. This program provokes the student to grapple with such fundamental issues as: From what roots does Western culture spring? What is the nature and function of language, and what is its relation to the arts? What is history; how do we make the past relevant to the present and the future? In sum, what does it mean to be human? These questions show the fundamental connec - tion of classical studies with humanities and the liberal arts in general.

Linguistics The Linguistics program introduces the student to linguistics, the scientific study of language as a uniquely human phenomenon, with an ambi - tious purpose of gaining some insight into the way the mind works. The central core of the program consists of a small number of courses that deal systematically with various levels of linguistic structure \u2014 sound, word, sentence, and meaning. The undergraduate major consists of a total of 33 credits. There are four courses in the core (LING 201, 311, 315, and 321). Beyond the core, those majoring in linguistics will take two courses in the linguistics of a specific language, two courses in a less-commonly taught lan - guage, and a three-course elective component. Students working for a minor in linguistics will take one elective course beyond the core. The 500-level courses that follow are available to undergraduate or graduate students, and they may be substituted for the undergraduate course in a specific area of linguistics. The departments participating in the Linguis - tics Program are Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences; Communications; English; Foreign Languages and Literatures; Psychology; and Sociology and Anthropology.

Interdisciplin ary Studies/Plans 101Medieval and Renaissance Studies The concept of Medieval and Renaissance stud - ies is an integral part of the tradition of the Uni - versity. The interdisciplinary major and minor are designed to appeal to students who desire to cultivate a broadly integrated understand - ing of Western civilization. Unlike the vertical orientations of departmental disciplines, which follow one field of study from its beginnings to the present, the Medieval and Renaissance Stud - ies Program cuts horizontally across 15 subject areas, such as art, architecture, drama, music, literature, and philosophy, which were closely related in the Middle Ages. The program pres - ents a variety of ways to acquire perspectives concerning the nature and origins of the world in which we live. The major in Medieval and Renaissance studies requires a minimum of 33 hours of coursework: 30 hours to be selected from among 70 courses in the departments of Visual and Performing Arts, English, Foreign Languages and Literatures, History, Philosophy, and Politi - cal Science; and six hours of interdisciplinary courses. The minor in Medieval and Renais - sance studies requires a minimum of 15 hours of coursework, consisting of 12 hours of depart - mental courses and 3 hours of an interdisciplin - ary course.

Peace Studies Peace studies is an interdisciplinary field of study that examines the causes of, and proposed cures for, violence (sociological, economic, and psychological) in human affairs. Peace studies is a recognized discipline of study across the globe. Scholars study issues of war and peace, development and underdevelopment, the insti - tutionalization of racial and gender discrimina - tion, economic inequality and its connections to physical violence, and how war and conflict may be related to environmental devastation. Peace studies also examines the mechanisms by which peoples can move from violence and war to peace and justice. Students can earn a minor in peace studies that includes a core course, POL 230 (Introduc - tion to the Study of Peace), and four courses selected by students \u2014 in collaboration with a faculty mentor \u2014 that draw upon themes rel - evant to the study of peace. The peace studies committee also oversees an undergraduate research fellowship award, organizes panels on peace studies issues, and provides students with information about careers in peacemaking occupations. Religious Studies The Religious Studies Program offers the oppor - tunity to study the religious traditions of the world from the perspectives of several different departments at Purdue. To fulfill the require - ments for either the major or the minor, students may choose from a number of courses offered in the departments of English, History, Philosophy, and Sociology and Anthropology. Such an interdepartmental approach is designed to help students tailor the program to their special interests while at the same time broadening their understanding of the differ - ent aspects of the religious life and thought of humankind.

The purpose of the programs, which are entirely voluntary, is to educate and train young men and women in preparation for commission - ing as officers in the armed services. The prereq - uisites for graduation as a commissioned officer are successful completion of the undergraduate baccalaureate degree requirements and certain specified professional courses. These professional courses, which are taken in conjunction with the regular courses required for a degree, are part of the University's official online course repository available at www.courses.purdue.edu. Click on the \"Course Information \u2014 All Campuses\" link at the top of the page. In addition to these professional courses for which academic credit is granted, each service requires from one to two hours per week of extra - curricular military instruction for which Air Force and Army ROTC participants receive academic credit. These courses also are listed online. The officer education programs of the three services are similar. Each service offers schol - arship and non-scholarship programs. Non- scholarship students are eligible to compete during their freshman and sophomore years for a scholarship. Specific details of each service program are outlined on succeeding pages. For additional information, contact the applicable military department. Aerospace Studies The Air Force ROTC program recruits, moti - vates, and educates highly qualified students to become United States Air Force officers. To accomplish this goal, the Air Force ROTC curriculum is divided into several major areas: General Military Course (GMC), Professional Officer Course (POC), Leadership Laboratory, and Field Training. Aerospace Studies offers one-, two-, three-, and four-year programs. The General Military Course (GMC) is taken during a student's freshman and sophomore years, and each week consists of a one-hour aca - demic class and one to two hours of leadership laboratory. In the freshman year, students are introduced to the basic organization and roles of the Air Force, the benefits of an Air Force career, the Air Force community, and what an Air Force officer does. The sophomore year is dedicated to the study of Air Force history. The Professional Officer Course (POC) com - prises the last two years of Air Force ROTC and normally is taken during a student's junior and senior years. These three-semester-hour classes introduce students to leadership, followership, and management concepts \u2014 sometimes using practical application and discussion. In the final year, students are introduced to United States foreign policy trends, regional study issues, and preparation for service in the active duty Air Force. Once enrolled in the POC, cadets sign a contract agreeing to serve on active-duty for a specified period of time. This contract entitles them to a monthly, nontaxable stipend dur - ing the academic year. Prior enrollment in the GMC is not a prerequisite for entering the POC. Interested students should contact the Air Force ROTC detachment to apply for the POC. The Leadership Laboratory provides every student enrolled in Air Force ROTC with the opportunity to gain leadership experience. The Leadership Laboratory is open to students who are members of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps or who are eligible to pursue a commis - sion as determined by the professor of aerospace studies. Within the cadet wing, which is similar to the command structure of an Air Force base, the cadets receive a progressive sequence of leadership experiences. As freshmen, cadets learn basic drill maneuvers and receive brief - ings on military customs and courtesies. Sopho - mores are given their first chance to command a flight of cadets in preparation for field training attendance. Professional Officer Course cadets are charged with planning and organizing the entire operation of the cadet wing. Base visits and flight orientations along with guest speakers enhance the Leadership Laboratory experience. Field Training (FT) normally occurs between a cadet's sophomore and junior years in college. Field training is mandatory for entrance into the Professional Officer Course and is normally four to six weeks in duration. Training consists of traditional military training and practical exercises to enhance leadership skills. Cadets 11\u0018 Liberal Artsattending field training receive training pay and travel allowances. Air Force ROTC College Scholarships are available to highly qualified students on a com - petitive basis. The scholarship pays most or all of the student's college tuition and fees, and $510 for books as well as a tax-free subsistence allowance of between $250 and $400 a month. Four-year, three-year, two-year, and one-year scholarships of up to $15,000 a year are avail - able in all academic majors. Application lead- time is approximately six months. Interested individuals may contact the Air Force ROTC detachment for details on these scholarships. Students must meet minimum GPA require - ments and military retention standards to retain scholarships. Interested candidates may go to the Purdue AFROTC Web site at http://web.ics.purdue. edu/~afrotc.

Wright, M.A. Assistant Professors: Maj. J. G. Dorman, M.A.; Maj. D. A. Mitchell, M.A.; Capt M. M. Sax, M.A. Military Science The Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) at Purdue University is established for the purpose of training young men and women for service as officers in the United States Army. Those who successfully complete degree and program requirements are commissioned as second lieutenants in either the reserve or active forces in one of more than 17 professional career fields. Students enrolled in any cur - riculum offered by the University that leads to a baccalaureate degree are eligible to participate in the Army ROTC program. The Army ROTC program is divided into a basic course for freshmen and sophomores and an advanced course for juniors and seniors. Many students enroll in the basic course to determine their interest in a military career. Students do not incur any military service obli - gation by enrolling in any of the basic course classes. Those who complete the basic course may enter the advanced course with consent of the department head. Students accepted into the advanced course incur an eight-year military service obligation after they are commissioned as second lieutenants. This service obligation can be active, reserve, or a combination of both. Basic Course Students in the freshman-level courses receive two credits per semester and attend one hour of class and two hours of leadership laboratory each week. Classes are designed to explain the lifestyle and duties of a professional Army offi - cer; to present career opportunities in the mili - tary; and to provide students with a background in communications, leadership, and military skills that will benefit the individual, regardless of the ultimate career choice. Laboratory periods are designed to teach leadership-related skills and to develop self-confidence and teamwork. Students receive professional development classes in the laboratory that include developing leadership skills, basic rifle marksmanship and weapons familiarization, water survival, drill and ceremony, individual and squad movement techniques, and basic rappelling. Students in the sophomore-level classes receive three credits a semester and attend two hours of class and two hours of leadership laboratory each week. The development of fundamental leadership and managerial skills is stressed in both the classroom and the leader - ship laboratory. The focus of classroom training shifts to the development of more advanced military skills such as land navigation, small unit tactics, performance-oriented training and individual instruction, and a survey of the Army's branches and functions. Officer Education Programs 11\u0018Two-Year Program This program is available to students who missed the opportunity to take the basic courses. It is also open to graduate students and others with at least four semesters remaining toward completion of degree requirements. Students entering the two-year program must attend the four-week Leadership Training course at Fort Knox, Kentucky, in lieu of the basic course. Veterans Qualified veterans may participate in the Simul - taneous Membership Program (SMP) and enroll directly in the advanced course and receive con - structive academic credit for the basic course. Advanced Course During the junior and senior years, additional emphasis is devoted to developing leader - ship and managerial skills. The subject matter includes an analysis of behavioral concepts as related to leadership, management of resources, and analysis of management operations using military units as a model. Advanced-course students receive four credits per semester and attend four hours of class and two hours of leadership laboratory training each week. They receive an allowance of $450 to $500 a month during each month school is in session. Advanced-course students attend 32 days of training at Fort Lewis, Washington, in the sum - mer between the junior and senior years. The Leader Development and Assessment Course (LDAC) provides an opportunity for students to demonstrate knowledge of skills acquired in the classroom and to gain practical leadership experience. It also validates their qualifications to become second lieutenants in the United States Army. Advanced-course students are required to enroll in PES-114R, Army ROTC Physical Con - ditioning. The course is worth one semester credit hour and meets for one hour, three times a week. The physical training program is designed to improve students' muscular strength, muscu - lar endurance, flexibility, and body composition. This course prepares students to excel during the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) conducted during the school year, at LDAC, and upon com - missioning. It also provides them with a better understanding of the Army fitness program, how to conduct and lead a physical training session, and the key elements to better physical fitness. Army Scholarship Program Students enrolled in Army ROTC may compete for and receive four-year, three-year, and two- year Army ROTC scholarships that pay full tuition and fees, $900 per year for textbooks, and $300 to $500 a month subsistence allow - ance. Interested candidates may find information about the Department of Military Science at www.purdue.edu.armyrotc, by calling (765) 494-2099, or by writing to the Department of Military Science, Purdue University Army ROTC; 812 Third Street; West Lafayette, IN 47907-1512.

Lohnes, B.S. 120 Liberal ArtsNaval Science The Navy and Marine Corps program provides a professional curriculum in naval science. Students are enrolled in two categories: the Scholarship Program and the non-scholarship College Program. Students in both categories take the same professional courses and extracur - ricular military training. The major differences in the two categories lie in the areas of selection, financial aid, military obligation, and summer cruises. NROTC Scholarship Students Scholarship students are selected for enrollment in the program through a nationwide competi - tion conducted each year. Selected candidates are appointed as Midshipman, USNR, by the Secretary of the Navy; are enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve; and receive tuition, fees, a cash stipend for textbooks and equipment, uni - forms, and a subsistence allowance beginning at $250 a month and increasing with seniority in the program. They participate in at-sea training during the three summers of their four-year col - lege curriculum. Midshipmen receive all travel expenses and are paid approximately $500 per month during their summer training periods. Upon receipt of a baccalaureate degree and completion of all naval science professional courses, graduates are commissioned as Ensign, U.S. Navy Reserve, or Second Lieutenant, U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. These officers agree to retain their commissions for eight years, during which time they serve a minimum of four years on active duty. Interested candidates may obtain complete details about the Navy and Marine Corps Schol - arship programs from their guidance counselors, naval recruiting stations, or the NROTC Unit, Purdue University at www.purdue.edu/nrotc. College Program Students A number of students are selected for enrollment each year by the professor of naval science. Applicants are screened and selected on the basis of personal interviews, past academic achieve - ment, and school and community involvement. Students interested in receiving more informa - tion about the four-year College Program should check \"Naval ROTC\" on their application for admission to Purdue University. All application information will then be mailed to the student. Requests for this or any other information about the program may be made by contacting Naval Science at Purdue University; 812 Third Street; West Lafayette, IN 47907-2006 or by calling (765) 494-2055 or toll-free (866) 466-0028. The Web address is www.purdue.edu/nrotc. Students desiring enrollment in the College Program should sign up for two fall courses, NS 110 and 202, and visit the naval science offices in the Armory before the start of classes. College Program students are furnished uni - forms, naval science textbooks, and during the last two years, a subsistence allowance, which increases with seniority. A four-week summer- at-sea training period is required and normally occurs between the junior and senior years. Dur - ing the summer training period, students receive all travel expenses and are paid approximately $500 a month. Upon receipt of a baccalaureate degree and completion of all the naval science professional courses, graduates are commis - sioned as Ensign, U.S. Navy Reserve, or Second Lieutenant, U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. These officers agree to retain their commissions for eight years, during which time they serve a mini - mum of three years on active duty. Outstanding College Program students may be nominated for, and receive, NROTC schol - arships any time after their freshman year. Academic performance at the University and military performance at the NROTC unit are the criteria for selection. Two-Year Scholarship Program A limited number of college students are selected during the spring of the sophomore year to par - ticipate in the last two years of the NROTC program. Applicants are screened and selected on the basis of personal interviews, past col - lege performance, and physical qualifications. Applicants must already have completed one year of calculus. An application for this program must be submitted prior to April 1 during the student's sophomore year. Students selected for the Two-Year Scholar - ship Program will attend the Naval Science Institute during the summer before the junior year to receive instruction and training similar to the first two years of the NROTC Four-Year Scholarship Program. Upon satisfactory com - pletion of the Naval Science Institute, students will follow the same program as the scholar - ship program students in their junior year at the University.

Fifteen ensembles are available to both undergraduate and graduate students, including concert bands, jazz bands, a marching band, a vocal/instrumental jazz group, and a full sym - phony orchestra. The different ensembles allow for participation by students with varying degrees of proficiency, from average player to near pro - fessional. Students also have the opportunity to participate in small ensemble and solo situations as well as in two basketball pep bands. Purdue instrumental ensembles are recog - nized campus-wide and world-wide for the high standards they set. Purdue bands have per - formed throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe, and have traveled to Japan, Sin - gapore, China, and South America as musical ambassadors for the University. Over 119 years of rich tradition inspire more than 600 students each year to participate in one or more Univer - sity band ensembles. Participation in Purdue bands and orchestra is open to any Purdue student through a regular audition process. Band and orchestra courses are scheduled in the same manner as other academic classes and carry two hours of academic credit a semester. Concert Organizations Symphonic Band The University Symphonic Band is Purdue's foremost musical organization. The traditional symphonic wind band instrumentation is used, and members rank among the finest instrumen - talists on the Purdue campus. Internationally known soloists and conductors appear with the ensemble, and there are regular opportunities to travel. The Symphonic Band performs a concert series each semester and is featured at com - mencement and other formal University func - tions. The Symphonic Band meets three days per week during fall and spring semesters. Symphony Orchestra The University Symphony Orchestra is one of the premier performing organizations at Purdue. It is organized with the standard full symphony orchestra instrumentation, including a complete complement of strings, winds, and percussion. The orchestra performs the finest orchestral literature of all musical periods at programs on campus and around the state. The ensemble is featured at the spring honors convocation and other University functions. The Symphony Orchestra meets three days a week during fall and spring semesters. Concert Band In the fall, the Concert Band provides perfor - mance opportunities for all indoor band students who are not selected for the Symphonic Band. A minimum of two formal concerts are held at selected campus venues. In the spring, the band is the second of five wind bands available to students, and the performance literature is more complex. Spring performances include a regular concert series as well as an appearance at the Purdue Bands Showcase in Elliott Hall of Music. Collegiate Band Offered only in the spring semester, the Univer - sity Collegiate Band performs a wide variety of traditional and contemporary band literature at a level slightly less complex than that of the Con - cert Band. Performances include a regular con - cert series as well as an appearance at the Purdue Bands Showcase in Elliott Hall of Music.122 Liberal ArtsVarsity Band The University Varsity Band meets only during the spring semester and provides instrumental music experiences for students of average talent and ability.

The Varsity Band presents a regular concert series as well as an appearance at the Purdue Bands Showcase in Elliott Hall of Music. Summer Concert Band The Summer Concert Band provides a perfor - mance opportunity for students on campus dur - ing the first part of Summer Session. Credit is optional, and the ensemble is open to interested community members along with faculty and students. The band holds a concert at Slayter Center in mid-July. Jazz Organizations Purdue Jazz Band This award-winning ensemble uses the standard \"big-band\" instrumentation as it performs tradi - tional and contemporary jazz literature. Some of the greatest names in jazz regularly appear as soloists, and the ensemble often performs at some of the renowned world centers of jazz in addition to a regular series of campus and com - munity concerts. Student members are expected to have a strong background and ability in jazz performance and improvisation. The course meets two evenings a week during fall and spring semesters. Jazz Lab Band The Purdue Jazz Lab Band offers a jazz perfor - mance opportunity for students interested in a slightly less demanding course. Using standard \"big-band\" instrumentation, the Jazz Lab Band performs regularly for campus and community events and presents a campus-based concert series each semester. The course meets during the fall and spring semesters. Concert Jazz Band The Purdue Concert Jazz Band expands the jazz performance opportunity to those students who wish to improve their ensemble and improvisa - tional techniques. The band is organized with the same instrumentation as the Jazz Lab Band, but performance requirements are less demand - ing. The Concert Jazz Band is part of the regular campus jazz performance series and plays on request for other campus events. The course meets during fall and spring semesters. American Music Repertory Ensemble The American Music Repertory Ensemble (AMRE) is composed of singers and an 18-piece jazz ensemble. The group presents many facets of American popular music, including jazz, pop, Broadway, swing, movies, and television music. Choreography and special acts, along with many instrumental features, are parts of AMRE's pre - sentation. Performances are scheduled on and off campus. The opportunity for travel exists based on student and performance demands. The course meets during fall and spring semesters. Jazz Workshop This survey course is offered based on student demand, and, as such, meets only when reg - istration warrants. The course provides for an in-depth study of jazz improvisation, jazz per - formance styles, jazz history, and jazz theory. The course combines classroom study with instrumental performance. Summer Jazz Band The Purdue Summer Jazz Band provides a jazz performance opportunity for students on cam - pus during the first part of the summer session. Credit is optional, and the ensemble is open to interested community members as well as fac - ulty and students. The band holds a concert at Slayter Center in July. Marching and Spirit Organizations \"All-American\" Marching Band The Purdue \"All-American\" Marching Band is one of the largest ensembles of its type in the nation. The band has a rich, century-old tradi - tion of excellence and is known worldwide for its up-tempo, high-energy performance style. It has appeared throughout the United States and numerous countries and has been featured on national television broadcasts. This band received the 1995 Sudler Trophy, presented to the finest college marching bands in the nation. Although the band is organized during the fall semester as a spirit organization that supports the Saturday football pageantry in Ross-Ade Stadium, additional performance opportunities are presented each year for travel to away games, post-season bowl games, and other per - formance venues around the world, including regular performances as the host band for the Purdue University Bands and Orchestra 123Indianapolis 500 Mile Race. In addition to the full complement of winds and percussion, the band offers performance opportunities for students with a background in twirling (\"All- American\" Twirling Line and Solo Twirlers), dance line performance (the Goldusters), and precision flag work (\"Golden Silks\"). During the spring semester, the auxiliary groups, including the twirlers, dancers, and flag corps members, may elect to participate in the group for performances at indoor venues, includ - ing home basketball games. Students interested in marching band are required to attend a week - long workshop on campus the week before fall semester classes begin. Volleyball Band This pep band, known as the Boiler Box Band, performs for all home volleyball games dur - ing fall semester. Membership is open to all instrumentalists on campus, with a twice-a-week rehearsal requirement. The band is the ideal performance opportunity for students who enjoy playing with a \"spirit\" group but are unable to participate in marching band. Basketball Bands Purdue University Bands offers participation opportunities in two basketball bands \u2014 Boiler Brass (men's basketball) and Gold and Black Sound (women's basketball). Membership in both bands is open only to students enrolled in regular fall and spring University Bands courses and is by audition. A regular weekly rehearsal is required.Private Lessons Applied Music Studies The Applied Music Studies program offers students private lessons on all wind, string, and percussion instruments, including piano and gui - tar. Instructors are well-known musicians from the area. Various lesson packages are offered on a noncredit basis, with a special lab fee based on the number of lessons scheduled. Lessons are scheduled on a semester basis. Students regis - tering for a package of eight one-hour lessons may receive an hour of academic credit for their study. Students interested in the program should contact the Department of University Bands dur - ing the first week of each new semester for addi - tional information and registration materials. General Information Band and orchestra credit is accepted toward the graduation requirements, in various amounts, by all colleges and schools on campus. Students in the College of Liberal Arts may receive credit for four semesters (or eight total credit hours) of band. Membership in any band course is by audition and with the consent of the instructor. The larger and more unusual instruments \u2014 as well as all uniforms \u2014 used in instrumental ensembles are owned by the University and are available on loan from the department without charge to students registered for a band course. The University assesses a small lab fee and an activity fee for participation in band courses, and charges an hourly rate for applied music lessons based on the lesson package selected. Required public performances are an essential part of the ensemble courses. Students seeking additional information about, or membership in, University Bands should con - tact the University Bands Office, Room 135, Elliott Hall of Music.
