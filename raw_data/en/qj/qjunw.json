CIP was originally developed by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for EducationStatistics (NCES) in 1980, with revisions occurring in 1985 and 1990. The 2000 edition of the CIP (CIP-2000) is the third revision of the taxonomy and presents an updated taxonomy of instructional programclassifications and descriptions. Revisions to national and international coding schemes such as the CIP require that users be given ample opportunity to comment on proposed changes as well as sufficient time to make these changes in theirreporting systems. In developing the CIP-2000, public comment was invited on two review drafts. Thisfinal publication reflects the comments that were received or agreements that were reached on theapproach to particular revisions. Additionally, to allow sufficient time for users to implement the CIP-2000in their databases and reporting systems, NCES will give users at least 2 years from the date ofpublication of the CIP-2000 to implement the revised taxonomy in reporting on postsecondary programcompletions. The CIP is the accepted federal government statistical standard on instructional program classifications and is used in a variety of education information surveys and databases. Since 1980 when it was firstpublished, the CIP has been used by NCES in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System(IPEDS) and its predecessor, the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS). It is also usedby other Department of Education offices, such as the Office for Civil Rights, the Office of Vocational andAdult Education, and the Office of Special Education, and serves as the standard on instructionalprograms for other federal agencies, including the (former) National Occupational InformationCoordinating Committee (NOICC), the National Science Foundation and the Department of Commerce(Bureau of the Census), the Department of Labor (Bureau of Labor Statistics), and others. The CIP isalso used by the National Academy of Sciences, state agencies, national associations, academicinstitutions, and employment counseling services as the basis for collecting, reporting, and analyzinginstructional program data. The CIP-2000 has been adopted as the standard field of study taxonomy by Statistics Canada. The decision to adopt the CIP-2000 was based on the comprehensiveness and detail of the CIP and thepotential for enhanced comparability with U.S. education data. The CIP will be phased in to replaceStatistics Canada's University Student Information System (USIS) and Community College StudentInformation System (CCSIS) as well as the Canadian Census major field of study classification.Transition from the USIS, CCSIS, and Canadian Census codes to CIP-2000 will begin with theimplementation of the postsecondary Enhanced Student Information System (ESIS) by the CanadianCentre for Education Statistics (CES). Consultations between the CES and the NCES and NationalLibrary of Education (NLE) have resulted in the inclusion of Canadian content within the CIP-2000. The number of instructional programs added to the CIP-2000 is a testament not only to the changing nature of postsecondary education in the United States and Canada but also to the completeness that thispublication has achieved. We are pleased to present this edition of the CIP. C. Dennis Carroll Roslyn Korb T.

The Guide delineates the organizational structure and standard conventions used to develop the CIP-2000 taxonomy. Organization of the CIP Taxonomy. The programs within the CIP taxonomy are organized on 3 levels: 1) a 2-digit series, 2) a 4-digit series, and 3) a 6-digit program level. The CIP codes and their corresponding programs are listed in ascending order by the code number. Skips or breaks in code continuity result from codes/programs that have either been moved within the taxonomy or deleted. Refer to table 2 and appendices B-1 through B-3 for listings of code/program moves and deletions. The 2-digit Series codes and programs represent summary groups of related programs. The 2-digit codes and programs are located at the beginning of each program group; the program titles appear in bold type and capital letters (Examples: 01. AGRICULTURE, AGRICULTURE OPERATIONS, AND RELATED SCIENCES; 13. EDUCATION, and 22. LEGAL PROFESSIONS AND STUDIES) . Each 2-digit group contains both 4-digit series and 6-digit code programs. The 4-digit Series codes and programs represent an intermediate aggregation of programs. The 4-digit series and the programs that comprise them are listed in numerical sequence. Program titles at this level appear in bold type. Examples : 01.00 Agriculture, General; 01.01 Agricultural Business and Management, and 01.02 Agricultural Mechanization . The 6-digit codes and program listings represent single instructional programs. These are the most detailed program classifications within the CIP; they are also the codes and programs used by institutions to report degree completions and fields of study data. The numbering sequence at this level is similar to the 4-digit Series sequence, with two more digits added after the 4-digit Series number. The standard format for the 6-digit programs is as follows : 01.0101 Agricultural Business and Management, General ; and 19.0707 Family and Community Services . Programs with a more general focus appear at the beginning of the Series, Example : Agriculture Business and Management, General (code 01.0101) appears as the first program listing. An \"Other\" category appears as the final program within the series. This coding option is included to provide a category for reporting data on specific programs that are not listed within the series. Example: 01.0199, Agricultural Business and Management, Other. Programs Added to the CIP (New CIP Programs). For ease of identification and use, programs that have been added to the taxonomy are identified in two ways: 1) the program title appears in italics and 2) a \"NEW\" qualifier appears in parenthesis after the program title. Programs classified as \" NEW\" are programs that have either been added to the taxonomy since the release of the CIP-1990 or have been reinstated from previous editions of the CIP. Examples : 01.08 Agricultural Public Services (NEW ); 01.0802 Agricultural Communication/Journalism (NEW ); and 51.2209 Maternal and Child Health (NEW ). Programs such as Urban Forestry (code 03.0508); and Comparative Psychology (code 42.0501) are also classified as \" NEW\" because they are restored programs (i.e., programs/codes that were deleted from previous taxonomies but have been reinstated in the CIP-2000). A list of all new programs is provided in table 1. New CIP Codes. The CIP-2000 taxonomy also contains several new numeric CIP codes (i.e., codes that were added to the taxonomy for the first time). These new CIP codes are not necessarily indicative of new programs. In many cases, they reflect codes that were added to accommodate a reorganization or repositioning of programs or program groups. New CIP codes are not identified within the taxonomy but are listed in appendix C. Example : code 51.3603 was added to the taxonomy because the program Hypnotherapy was moved from its location in the CIP-1990 to a newly-established program group (Series 51.36: Movement and Mind-Body Therapies and Education).III - 2III. CIP-2000 TAXONOMY: FULL LISTING OF PROGRAM CODES, TITLES, AND DEFINITIONS Guide to Using the CIP Taxonomy Deleted Programs. Programs that have been deleted from the CIP are identified as follows: 1) the program code is enclosed in brackets, and 2) a notation that the program has been Deleted follows the program title. There are two types of deletions, Straight Deletions which indicate a code or series has been completely removed from the taxonomy and Crosswalked Deletions which identify programs that have been deleted as separate entries but combined or integrated into other existing programs. Instructions are provided for these deletions indicating where the program is currently located and should be reported. Example 1: [03.04] Forest Production and Processing. (Deleted) Example 2: [03.0203] Natural Resources Law Enforcement and Protective Services. (Deleted, Report under 03.0299) Moved Programs . Programs that have been repositioned within the CIP are identified in 2 ways: 1) the program code is enclosed in parentheses and 2) a notation is provided after the program title indicating where the program has been moved. Example 1: (01.0501) Agricultural/Farm Supplies Retailing and Wholesaling. (Moved, Report under 01.0105). Example 2 : (15.1101) Engineering Technology, General. (Moved, Report under 15.0000) Note A summary of Moved programs is provided in table 2. Specific program movements are identified in the Crosswalk of CIP-1990 to CIP-2000 Codes and Programs ( table 3). Cross-references. Cross-references or crosswalks are provided to refer the CIP user to related codes/programs within the CIP. Their primary purpose is to refer the CIP user to a more appropriate code/classification for use in reporting a program. Cross-references are located immediately below the program that they are related to and are preceded by 5 dashes in the place where a CIP code would appear. The title of the Series or program that the CIP user is referred to is listed, followed by a ( Report under ...) instruction that indicates which program should be considered for use. Cross-references are made to specific programs (i.e., 6-digit programs) or to 4- or 2-digit groups. Example 1: 14.0701 Chemical Engineering ----- Chemistry . (Report under 40.05 Series) ----- Chemical Technology/Technician. (Report under 41.0301) A second type of cross-reference uses a (See Also ... ) notation to refer the user to a comparable program located in another 2-digit series that should be considered for use. Example 2: 19.0201 Business Family and Consumer Sciences/Human Sciences. ----- Hospitality Administration/Management. (See also 52.09 Series) Multiple Program Titles. Program listings with multiple titles indicate that two or more interchangeable titles are in use for an instructional program. The program titles appear with a Slash (\"/\") separating the two titles in use . The most commonly used title appears first, followed by the title that is used less frequently. (Examples: 43.0103, Criminal Justice/Law Enforcement Administration and 50.0502, Technical Theatre/Theatre Design and Technology ).III - 3CIP-2000 TAXONOMY: FULL LISTING OF PROGRAM CODES, TITLES, AND DEFINITIONS CHAPTER I: ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONALLY-SPECIFIC PROGRAMS The program codes and series in this chapter define instructional programs that are offered at the postsecondary level.

Data on high school completions and awards are collected and analyzed annually by the UnitedStates Department of Education. High school/secondary awards that do not reflect completion of aninstructional program (such as Certificates of Attendance) are not included in the CIP taxonomy. Regular high school diplomas, regardless of type, represent the successful completion of 16 or more prescribed Carnegie Units of instruction. (Each Carnegie Unit equals one academic year ofinstruction in a specific subject matter area, at approximately one instructional hour per school day.) Depending on state policy, secondary students enrolled in vocational and other programs may receive more than one completion award. In states offering separate vocational diplomas,individuals receiving recognized vocational diplomas will also have completed a regular secondaryacademic program, and will be simultaneously certified in both. Other states do not offer a separatesecondary vocational diploma, but offer either a certificate of completion in specified vocationalprograms or program areas, or make no distinction at all. Proficiency in specific academic subject matter areas is also certified in some states by the simultaneous award of a regular secondary diploma and certification of competence in one or morespecific programs or program areas. Other states award separate college preparatory diplomas tothose students completing specified credits in academic subjects. In addition, a few states awardhonors or regents diplomas that certify outstanding scholastic performance in either academic orvocational programs. State policy also determines the treatment of completions and awards in the area of special education. Under the authority of PL 94-142, all handicapped students in the United States underage 21 must have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), which specifies the knowledge and skillsthat the student is expected to achieve. Some states implement this national requirement byawarding a regular secondary diploma to students who successfully complete their IEPrequirements, without regard to the standard Carnegie Unit requirements of such diplomas. Otherstates award certificates of IEP completion along with attendance certificates, but not diplomas. Stillothers do not formally recognize IEP completions, and do not separately distinguish specialeducation students receiving any kind of award. It is also possible to be certified to have met diploma requirements without having attended a traditional or recognized secondary school, or having completed a program, either by examination orby official acceptance of credentials earned outside the United States. 53.
