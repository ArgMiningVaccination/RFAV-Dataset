This guide breaks down your options\u2014from vitamins to herbs", "sitename": "Gaia Herbs", "date": "2023-07-26", "cleaned_text": "For most people, the 30s are a rich and defining decade of life, one that demands energy, stamina, and peak performance. Whether your fourth decade includes starting a business, buying a home, taking a leap in your career, starting a family, extensive travel, caring for family members, focusing on your health, or other pursuits, most 30-somethings are looking for ways to support their health and energy\u2014now and as the years go by. If you're considering supplementation as part of a healthy lifestyle, this article can help. Although supplements cannot replace a healthy diet and lifestyle, which should always be paramount, they may benefit people in their 30s. In this article, we'll look at the best vitamins, supplements, and herbs to take in your 30s for specific support, including: - Reproductive health - Sleep - Stress - Energy - Exercise recovery - Thyroid support - Gut health We'll also touch on the controversy around multivitamins and whether they are worth considering in your 30s. Do You Need To Take Vitamins & Supplements In Your 30s? Aside from the blanket recommendation to take a prenatal vitamin while pregnant, whether you need to take vitamins, herbs, and other supplements in your 30s (or any other time) is a hotly debated topic. Some experts believe you can get everything you need from focusing on diet, while others believe taking certain supplements can be very beneficial. However, both sides agree there is no one-size-fits-all regarding supplementation. For example, we now know some people have specific genetic mutations that make them unable to process certain forms of nutrients, such as B vitamins or iron. REF#2425 REF#2426 Many of these genetic mutations or variants, such as MTHFR, can be remedied by taking specific methylated supplements, which bypass the mutation and can be readily absorbed by the body. REF#2427 Taking supplements can be a game-changer for those with MTHFR or other genetic variations. Plus, certain supplements and herbs have been shown effective for supporting the body during times of stress, aiding sleep, supporting the gut microbiome, and more. So, should you consider supplementation in your 30s? That depends on your health, goals, diet, lifestyle, and other considerations. Always check with your healthcare practitioner before taking a new supplement or beginning a supplement regime. The Best Vitamins, Supplements, & Herbs for Women's Reproductive Health Whether you're planning to start a family, already have one, or not, your 30s is a great decade to become more mindful of reproductive health. For women, this typically means focusing on hormonal balance, which can affect many aspects of health, including: - Menstrual cycle - Metabolism - Mood - Thyroid health - Sleep - Weight - And more We'll start by looking at nutrients and herbs that may support women's reproductive health and hormonal balance. Nutrients For Female Reproductive Health Research has shown the following nutrients may support various aspects of women's reproductive health: - Iron: Given the prevalence of iron deficiency among menstruating women (approximately 29% globally per the World Health Organization REF#2428), daily iron supplementation may be beneficial for women of reproductive age. REF#2429 [health](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/women-and-the-evolution-of-health-care)problems, so always have your levels checked before taking an iron supplement\u00b7 [](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27087396/) - B vitamins: Including B6, B12, and B9 (folate) have all been shown to be essential for supporting reproductive health.REF#2430 REF#2431 - Vitamin D: Getting enough of \"the sunshine vitamin,\" which is also a hormone, is critical to various aspects of female reproductive health, normal menstruation, egg quality, immunity, brain function, and more.REF#2432 Herbs That May Support Women's Reproductive Health Various herbs have been used for centuries as female tonics across cultures. Some examples include: - Maca Root: Also known as \"Peruvian ginseng,\" was a classic female tonic for the ancient Mayans. Research has shown it may [support hormonal balance](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/maca-benefits-for-women)(including stress hormone balance) and REF#2435 REF#2436 - Vitex Berry/Chastetree: Vitex Berry has been shown to support normal balance of reproductive hormones.REF#2437 It's also been shown [supportive for normal menstruation](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/vitex-berry-benefits)and for easing premenstrual complaints.REF#2438 Get more helpful tips on women's reproductive health and menstruation in: [Female Hormones and Menstruation 101.](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/female-hormones-and-menstruation-101) The Best Vitamins, Supplements, & Herbs for Men's Reproductive Health Historically, men have generally focused less on reproductive and hormonal than women. However, research has shown a man's hormonal balance and reproductive function are equally important to overall health, sexual function, and happiness. Here are some nutrients to consider for men in their 30s. Nutrients For Male Reproductive Health - Zinc: Zinc has been shown to play a role in the normal production and balance of testosterone, a primarily male sex hormone.REF#2439 - Vitamin D: Research has shown vitamin D levels in men are associated with sperm count, quality, and function, as well as hormonal balance and sexual function.REF#2440 REF#2441 - Omega 3 fatty acids: Essential fatty acids, such as omega 3s found in fatty fish, hemp seeds, and chia seeds, have been shown potentially supportive for male reproductive health, including semen function and quality.REF#2442 Herbs That May Support Male Reproductive Health Many herbs have been traditionally used for men's wellness and reproductive health. The following is a sample of a few traditional herbs for male hormonal function: - Maca: This ancient herb has also been shown to offer potential benefits for men's hormonal balance, including supporting testosterone and luteinizing hormone. REF#2443 REF#2444 It's also been shown to [support normal sperm function](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/maca-benefits-for-men). REF#2445 - Ashwagandha: Also known as \"Indian Ginseng, this Ayurvedic herb has been shown to potentially [support normal sexual function](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/ashwagandha-benefits-for-men), sperm count and quality, and male hormone balance.REF#2446 REF#2447 Besides nutrient status, many lifestyle factors, including diet, sleep, and exercise, may influence male reproductive health. Talk to your healthcare practitioner about the best approach to supporting your reproductive and hormonal health. Vitamins, Supplements, & Herbs To Support Sleep Getting enough sleep has become a challenge for people of all ages, with an estimated 1 in 3 Americans not getting the recommended 7.5-9 hours of sleep per night. For those in their 30s, having children and more demanding work schedules can compound this issue. When sleep doesn't easy, consider leaning on these herbs and supplements for temporary support: - Ashwagandha: Various studies have shown the active plant compound, triethylene glycol in this ancient Ayurvedic herb may offer various sleep benefits, including supporting: REF#2455 REF#2456 REF#2457 - Sleep duration - Sleep quality - Wake after sleep onset - Sleep efficiency - Mental alertness upon waking - Sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) - Magnesium: Also known as \"the anti-stress nutrient,\" several studies (and ample anecdotal evidence) have shown a possible link between magnesium status and sleep quality. REF#2448 - Valerian: Various research studies, including double-blind placebo-controlled trials, suggest Valerian may [support normal sleep](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/herbs-for-sleep).REF#2449 - Vitamin D: Studies have shown a decreased risk of sleep issues in those with optimal Vitamin D status.REF#2450 Plus, getting early morning sunlight (sunshine is the best natural Vitamin D source) effectively supports your natural sleep cycle. - Passionflower: Research suggests the common passionflower, often found growing wild in fields, [may help support sleep quality](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/herbs-for-sleep).REF#2451 These herbs and supplements are intended to be used to support normal sleep function or for occasional sleepless nights. Always check with your healthcare practitioner before using herbs or other supplements for sleep. Vitamins, Supplements, & Herbs To Support Stress Response Although the 30s season of life comes with a richness of new experiences and wisdom, it can also bring its share of stressors. Especially for new parents, those expanding their careers or education, or anyone caring for aging or sick loved ones. Research has shown that stress can affect the concentration of nutrients in the body, causing some to be depleted or metabolized more or less efficiently.REF#2452 For times of occasional stress, consider these vitamins, minerals, and herbs to support a healthy and resilient stress response and mind-body balance. - B-Vitamins: B-vitamins, including B6, biotin, and B12 have been shown helpful for supporting stress response and mood during times of stress.REF#2453 REF#2454 - Magnesium: Known as the \"anti-stress nutrient\" magnesium supports over 300 enzymatic processes in the body, including those that affect nervous system function, sleep, and stress response.REF#2455 It has been shown to be potentially effective for buffering stress, especially if combined with vitamin B6.REF#2456 - [Adaptogenic herbs](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/all-about-adaptogens): Adaptogenic herbs are a class of herbs that promote a healthy stress response via their supportive effects on the Hypothamaus-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis.REF#2457 Some examples of adaptogenic herbs include: - Nervine Herbs: Nervines are a class of herbs traditionally used to [support normal nervous system function](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/nourishing-nervine-herbs-for-stress-support)* and promote a state of calm. Some examples of nervines include: These herbs and supplements can (and should) be used in conjunction with lifestyle practices that support a healthy response, including exercise, meditation, getting enough sleep, therapy (if recommended), a healthy diet, nature therapy, and other stress-relieving practices recommended by your healthcare practitioner. Vitamins, Supplements, & Herbs To Support Energy Levels Many people feel they have all the energy they need in their 20s. However, most people in their 30s wouldn't turn down a little extra energy support! When choosing supplements or herbs for energy, look for products that do not contain caffeine, sweeteners, or other stimulants. Although these products can provide a temporary \"boost,\" they will not support your body's innate ability to produce energy and may even be harmful. Instead, consider these herbs and supplements to support normal energy levels. All nutrients play a role in our body's ability to produce energy and fight fatigue. However, the following nutrients have been shown to play a specific role in sustained energy, cognitive function, and well-being: REF#2458 - B-vitamins - Vitamin C - Iron - Magnesium - Zinc In addition, adaptogenic herbs, such as Ashwagandha, Maca, Nettles, Rhodiola, Ginseng, and Holy Basil have been traditionally used help support energy*. Vitamins, Supplements, & Herbs To Support Exercise Endurance & Recovery Regular exercise is vital in any season of life, including your 30s. According to the National Institutes of Health, National Institute On Aging, and other studies, exercise can also: REF#2459 REF#2460 REF#2461 REF#2462 - Offer benefits during pregnancy and postpartum (after an appropriate period of rest); - Can help reduce stress - Support reproductive function - Optimize weight - Promote bone health - Support sleep - Promote gut microbiome health - Build strength - Support aspects of cognitive function - Support normal blood pressure and heart function - Improve energy levels - and encourage a positive outlook. However, given the demanding schedules of many 30-somethings, starting and maintaining a regular exercise program can be challenging\u2014especially if you wake up sore and tired. This is where specific herbs and supplements may come in handy for supporting exercise recovery and endurance. No, we're not talking about expensive, hyped-up kitchen-sink ultra-protein-caffeinated powders with 25+ ingredients and added stimulants. Research suggests certain herbs, such as Ashwagandha,REF#2463 Green Tea,REF#2464 and Maca,REF#2465 may help support various aspects of exercise performance and recovery. Turmeric/Curcumin has been shown to support normal inflammatory and exercise recovery,REF#2466 and Boswellia, aka Frankincense, has also been shown to support normal inflammatory response. The evidence suggests these could help with occasional muscle soreness or tightness after exercise. Vitamins, Supplements, & Herbs for Thyroid Health Increased stress and responsibilities, having babies and caregiving, and getting older are all reasons to pay attention to thyroid health in your 30s. This is especially true for women, who tend to be more susceptible to thyroid issues than men. In addition to [working with a doctor familiar with the nuances of thyroid health](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/thyroid-symptoms), the following supplements may help maintain thyroid function. - Ashwagandha: Research suggests Ashwagandha supplementation of 600 mg daily may [support normal production and function of thyroid hormone levels](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/amazing-benefits-of-ashwagandha)in women ages 18-50.REF#2467 - Selenium: According to studies, the thyroid contains the highest concentrations of selenium per gram of tissue in the body, thus maintaining optimal levels of selenium is essential to maintaining thyroid function. REF#2468 - Ginger: Research has shown Ginger may promote various aspects of thyroid health, including downstream effects on body temperature, elimination, skin health, thyroid hormone, waist circumference, and [cholesterol](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/ginger-nausea).REF#2469 - Iodine or iodine-rich foods: Natural iodine has been shown to help support thyroid function, including T4, T3, and TSH levels.REF#2470 - However, some thyroid conditions do not respond well to additional dietary iodine or supplementation. Always check with your doctor before increasing your iodine consumption.

Although many doctors and healthcare professionals recommend multivitamins for those in their 30s, the evidence supporting their benefits is limited. However, it is difficult to track and quantify the benefits of multivitamins in controlled studies for several reasons, including: - Everyone's nutrient needs are different - Nutrient absorption and assimilation are affected by many factors, including diet, gut health, and genetics, to name a few - Not all multivitamins are consistent in their dosages of nutrients - Not all multivitamins are of equal quality. For example, some brands use whole-foods-based nutrients, and other source vitamins and minerals from synthetic sources - Not all multivitamins contain the most absorbable forms of nutrients for every person Plus, though they may provide value to some people, an isolated blend of vitamins or vitamins and minerals cannot take the place of the nutrition gained from natural foods, which contain hundreds or thousands of nutrients, phytochemicals, and other plant compounds. So, should you take a multivitamin in your 30s? Maybe. It all depends on your individual makeup, diet, lifestyle, genetics, nutrient status, and many other factors. However, prenatal vitamins are always recommended during pregnancy. Talk to your healthcare practitioner about the potential benefits of a multivitamin for your unique needs. How to Know Which Supplements and Herbs Are Right for You This article was detailed with many herbs and supplements that may benefit people in their 30s. However, there is no one-size-fits-all protocol for the best supplements in your 30s. If you want to try some of the herbs or other supplements listed here but aren't sure where to start, talk to your healthcare practitioner. They have a good understanding of your health and can order specific tests, such as nutrient profiles, genetic testing, gut health tests, etc., to determine which nutrients may be beneficial How to Choose Safe and High-Quality Supplements Not all supplements and herbs are created equal, that includes mainstream brands which may contain inferior ingredients or fillers. Plus, although herbs, for example, are generally very safe and effective, some can interact with certain medications and may not be appropriate for people with certain conditions. Here's what to look for in high-quality supplements and herbs: - Certified organic or wild-crafted herbs and other ingredients - Third-party testing for identity, purity, and contaminants - No artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, or fillers - Transparency in sourcing, like [Gaia Herbs' \"Meet Your Herbs\"](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/pages/meet-your-herbs)herb traceability program - Consider the source of the nutrients, whole foods, methylated, etc., for optimal absorption Finally, remember that you cannot out-supplement an unhealthy lifestyle. All supplements work best with a healthy whole foods diet, regular exercise, stress management, enough sleep, and solid social connections. Combine these, and you'll set yourself up for a season of health, vitality, and well-being in your 30s and beyond.
