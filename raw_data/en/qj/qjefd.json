Introduction. It is a virtually impossible task to do justice, in a short span of time and space, to the great genius of Leonhard Euler. All we can do, in this lecture,is to bring across some glimpses of Euler's incredibly voluminous and diverse work,which today lls 74 massive volumes of the Opera omnia (with two more to come). Nine additional volumes of correspondence are planned and have already appeared inpart, and about seven volumes of notebooks and diaries still await editing! We begin in section 2 with a brief outline of Euler's life, going through the three stations of his life: Basel, St. Petersburg (twice), and Berlin. In section 3, we identifyin more or less chronological order Euler's principal works and try to convey a flavorand some characteristic features of his work by describing in more detail a few of hismany outstanding contributions. We conclude in section 4 with remarks on Euler'spersonalityandintellect, asgainedfromtestimonialsofhiscontemporaries, andonthequality of his craft, and in section 5 with some bibliographic information for furtherreading.

HisLife. 2.1. Basel 1707-1727: Auspicious Beginnings. Leonhard Euler was born on April 15, 1707, the rst child of Paulus Euler and Margaretha Brucker. Paulus Eulercame from modest folk, while Margaretha Brucker's ancestors includea number of well-known scholars in the classics. Euler's father at the time was a vicarat the church of St. Jakob, just outside the old city walls of Basel. Although atheologian, Paulus had interests in mathematics and took courses from the famousJakob Bernoulli during the rst two years of his study at the university. About a yearand a half after Leonhard's birth, the family moved to Riehen, a suburb of Basel,where Paulus Euler assumed the position of Protestant minister at the local parish.He served in that capacity faithfully and devotedly for the rest of his life. Fig.1The parish residence and church in Riehen. The parish residence, as it looks today (Figure 1), seems comfortable enough, but at the time it had one floor less and only two rooms with heating. The living quartersit provided, therefore, were rather cramped, especially after the family increased byanotherchild, AnnaMaria, in1708. Twomorechildren, MariaMagdalenaandJohannHeinrich, were to follow later on. Leonhard received his rst schooling in mathematics at home from his father. Around the age of eight he was sent to the Latin school in Basel and given roomand board at his maternal grandmother's house. To compensate for the poor qual-ity then prevailing at the school, Paulus Euler hired a private tutor for his son, ayoung theologian by the name of Johannes Burckhardt, himself an enthusiastic loverof mathematics. In October of 1720, at the age of thirteen (not unusual at the time),Leonhard enrolled at the University of Basel, rst at the philosophical faculty, wherehe took the freshman courses on elementary mathematics given by Johann Bernoulli,the younger brother of the now deceased Jakob. The young Euler pursued his math-ematical studies with such a zeal that he soon caught the attention of Bernoulli,who encouraged him to study more advanced books on his own and even oered himassistance at his house every Saturday afternoon. In 1723, Euler graduated witha master's degree and a public lecture (in Latin) comparing Descartes's system ofnatural philosophy with that of Newton. Following the wishes of his parents, he then entered the theological faculty, de- voting, however, most of his time to mathematics. Euler's father eventually had toconcede, probably at the urging of Johann Bernoulli, that Leonhard was predestinedLEONHARD EULER: HIS LIFE, THE MAN, AND HIS WORKS 5 Fig.2The old university of Basel and Johann IBernoulli. to a career in mathematics rather than one in theology. This is how Euler himself recounts this early learning experience at the university in his brief autobiography of1767 (here freely translated from pp. 1-7]): In 1720 I was admitted to the university as a public student, where I soon found the opportunity to become acquainted with the famous professorJohann Bernoulli, who made it a special pleasure for himself to help mealong in the mathematical sciences. Private lessons, however, he categor-ically ruled out because ofhis busy schedule. However, he gave me a f armore benecial advice, which consisted in myselfgetting a hold ofsomeofthe more dicult mathematical books and working through them withgreat diligence, and should I encounter some objections or diculties, heoered me free access to him every Saturday afternoon, and he was gra-cious enough to comment on the collected diculties, which was done withsuch a desired advantage that, when he resolved one ofmy objections, tenothers at once disappeared, which certainly is the best method ofmakinghappy progress in the mathematical sciences. These personal meetings have become known, and famous, as the privatissima , and they continued well beyond his graduation. It was during these privatissima that Johann Bernoulli more and more began to admire the extraordinary mathematicaltalents of the young Euler. Barely nineteen years old, Euler dared to compete with the greatest scientic minds of the time by responding to a prize question of the Paris Academy of Scienceswith a memoir on the optimal placing of masts on a ship. He, who at that pointin his life had never so much as seen a ship, did not win rst prize, but still arespectable second. A year later, when the physics chair at the University of Baselbecame vacant, the young Euler, dauntlessly again, though with the full support of hismentor, Johann Bernoulli, competed for the position, but failed, undoubtedly becauseof his youth and lack of an extensive record of publications. In a sense, this was ablessing in disguise, because in this way he was free to accept a call to the Academy ofSciences in St. Petersburg, founded a few years earlier by the czar Peter I (the Great),where he was to nd a much more promising arena in which to fully develop himself.The groundwork for this appointment had been laid by Johann Bernoulli and two ofhis sons, Niklaus II and Daniel I, both of whom were already active at the Academy.6 WALTER GAUTSCHI 2.2. St.Petersburg1727-1741:MeteoricRisetoWorldFameandAcademic Advancement. Euler spent the winter of 1726 in Basel studying anatomy and phys- iology in preparation for his anticipated duties at the Academy. When he arrived inSt. Petersburg and started his position as an adjunct of the Academy, it was soondetermined, however, that he should devote himself entirely to the mathematical sci-ences. In addition, he was to participate in examinations for the cadet corps andact as a consultant to the Russian state in a variety of scientic and technologicalquestions. Fig.3TheAcademyinSt.PetersburgandPeter I.(PhotographoftheAcademyofSciencescourtesy of Andreas Verdun.) Euler adjusted easily and quickly to the new and sometimes harsh life in the northern part of Europe. Contrary to most other foreign members of the Academyhe began immediately to study the Russian language and mastered it quickly, bothin writing and speaking. For a while he shared a dwelling with Daniel Bernoulli, andhe was also on friendly terms with Christian Goldbach, the permanent Secretary ofthe Academy and best known today for his\u2014still open\u2014conjecture in number theory.The extensive correspondence between Euler and Goldbach that ensued has becomean important source for the history of science in the 18th century. Euler's years at the Academy of St. Petersburg proved to be a period of extraor- dinary productivity and creativity. Many spectacular results achieved during thistime (more on this later) brought him instant world fame and increased status andesteem within the Academy. A portrait of Euler stemming from this period is shownin Figure 4. In January of 1734 Euler married Katharina Gsell, the daughter of a Swiss painter teaching at the Academy, and they moved into a house of their own. The marriagebrought forth thirteen children, of whom, however, only ve reached the age of adult-hood. The rst-born child, Johann Albrecht, was to become a mathematician himselfand later in life was to serve Euler as one of his assistants. Euler was not spared misfortunes. In 1735, he fell seriously ill and almost lost his life. To the great relief of all, he recovered, but suered a repeat attack three yearslater of (probably) the same infectious disease. This time it cost him his right eye,which is clearly visible on all portraits of Euler from this time on (for example, thefamous one in Figure 6, now hanging in the Basel Museum of Arts). The political turmoil in Russia that followed the death of the czarina Anna Ivanovna induced Euler to seriously consider, and eventually decide, to leave St. Pe-LEONHARD EULER: HIS LIFE, THE MAN, AND HIS WORKS 7 Fig.4Euler, ca. 1737. tersburg. This all the more as he already had an invitation from the Prussian king Frederick II to come to Berlin and help establish an Academy of Sciences there. Thisis how Euler put it in his autobiography: ...i n 1740, when His still gloriously reigning Royal Majesty [Frederick II] came to power in Prussia, I received a most gracious call to Berlin, which,after the illustrious Empress Anne had died and it began to look rather dis-mal in the regency that followed, I accepted without much hesitation .... In June of 1741, Euler, together with his wife Katharina, the six-year-old Johann Albrecht,andtheone-year-oldtoddlerKarl,setoutonthejourneyfromSt.Petersburgto Berlin. 2.3. Berlin1741-1766: TheEmergenceofEpochalTreatises. Because of his preoccupation with the war campaign in Silesia, Frederick II took his time to set upthe Academy. It was not until 1746 that the Academy nally took shape, with Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis its president and Euler the director of the MathematicsClass. In the interim, Euler did not remain idle; he completed some twenty memoirs,ve major treatises (and another ve during the remaining twenty years in Berlin),and composed over 200 letters! Even though Euler was entrusted with manifold duties at the Academy\u2014he had to oversee the Academy's observatory and botanical gardens, deal with personnelmatters, attend to nancial aairs, notably the sale of almanacs, which constitutedthe major source of income for the Academy, not to speak of a variety of technologicaland engineering projects\u2014his mathematical productivity did not slow down. Nor washe overly distracted by an ugly priority dispute that erupted in the early 1750s overEuler's principle of least action, which was also claimed by Maupertuis and whichthe Swiss fellow mathematician and newly elected academician Johann Samuel K\u00a8 onig asserted to have already been formulated by Leibniz in a letter to the mathematicianJakob Hermann. K\u00a8 onig even came close to accusing Maupertuis of plagiarism. When challenged to produce the letter, he was unable to do so, and Euler was asked toinvestigate. Not sympathetic to Leibniz's philosophy, Euler sided with Maupertuisand in turn accused K\u00a8 onig of fraud. This all came to a boil when Voltaire, aligned with K\u00a8onig, came forth with a scathing satire ridiculing Maupertuis So distraught was Maupertuis that he left Berlin soon thereafter, and Euler had to conduct the aairs of the Academy as de facto, if not de jure, president of the Academy. By now, Euler was suciently well-o that he could purchase a country estate in Charlottenburg, in the western outskirts of Berlin, which was large enough to providea comfortable home for his widowed mother (whom he had come to Berlin in 1750),his sister-in-law, and all the children. At just twenty years old, his rst-born son,Johann Albrecht, was elected in 1754 to the Berlin Academy on the recommendationof Maupertuis. With a memoir on the perturbation of cometary orbits by planetaryattraction he won in 1762 a prize of the Petersburg Academy, but had to share itwith Alexis-Claude Clairaut. Euler's second son, Karl, went to study medicine inHalle, whereas the third, Christoph, became an ocer in the military. His daughterCharlotte married into Dutch nobility, and her older sister Helene married a Russianocer later in 1777. Euler's relation with Frederick II was not an easy one. In part, this was due to the marked dierence in personality and philosophical inclination: Frederick\u2014LEONHARD EULER: HIS LIFE, THE MAN, AND HIS WORKS 9 proud, self-assured, worldly, a smooth and witty conversationalist, sympathetic to French enlightenment; Euler\u2014modest, inconspicuous, down-to-earth, and a devoutprotestant. Another, perhaps more important, reason was Euler's resentment fornever having been oered the presidency of the Berlin Academy. This resentmentwas only reinforced after Maupertuis's departure and Euler's subsequent eorts tokeep the Academy afloat, when Frederick tried to interest Jean le Rond d'Alembertin the presidency. The latter indeed came to Berlin, but only to inform the king ofhis disinterest and to recommend Euler for the position instead. Still, Frederick notonly ignored d'Alembert's advice, but ostentatiously declared himself the head of theAcademy! This, together with many other royal rebus, nally led Euler to leaveBerlin in 1766, in deance of several obstacles put in his way by the king. He indeedalready had a most cordial invitation from Empress Catherine II (the Great) to returnto the Academy of St. Petersburg, which he accepted, and was given an absolutelytriumphant welcome back.

St.Petersburg1766-1783:TheGloriousFinalStretch. Highly respected at the Academy and adored at Catherine's court, Euler now held a position of greatprestige and influence that had been denied him in Berlin for so long. He in fact wasthe spiritual if not the appointed leader of the Academy. Unfortunately, however,there were setbacks on a personal level. A cataract in his left (good) eye, whichalready began to bother him in Berlin, now became increasingly worse, so that in 1771Euler decided to undergo an operation. The operation, though successful, led to theformation of an abscess, which soon destroyed Euler's vision almost entirely. Later inthe same year, his wooden house burned down during the great re of St. Petersburg,and the almost blind Euler escaped from being burnt alive only by a heroic rescue byPeter Grimm, a workman from Basel. To ease the misfortune, the Empress grantedfunds to build a new house (the one shown in Figure 7with the top floor having beenadded later). Another heavy blow hit Euler in 1773 when his wife Katharina Gselldied. Euler remarried three years later so as not to be dependent on his children. In spite of all these fateful events, Euler remained mathematically as active as ever, if not more so. Indeed, about half of his scientic output was published, ororiginated, during this second St. Petersburg period, among which his two \"best-sellers,\" Letters to a German Princess andAlgebra. Naturally, he could not have done it without good secretarial and technical help, which he received from, among10 WALTER GAUTSCHI Fig.8Euler,1778. others, Niklaus Fuss, a compatriot from Basel and future grandson-in-law of Euler, and Euler's own son, Johann Albrecht. The latter, by now secretary of the Academy,also acted as the protocolist of the Academy sessions, over which Euler, as the oldestmember of the Academy, had to preside. The high esteem in which Euler was held at the Academy and at court is touch- ingly revealed by a passage in the memoirs of the Countess Dashkova, a directress ofthe Academy appointed by the empress. She recounts the rst time she accompaniedthe old Euler to one of the sessions of the Academy, probably Euler's last. Beforethe session started, a prominent professor and State Councilor as a matter of courseclaimed the chair of honor, next to the director's chair. The countess then turnedto Euler and said: \"Please be seated wherever you want; the seat you select will ofcourse become the rst of all.\" Leonhard Euler died from a stroke on September 18, 1783 while playing with one of his grandchildren. Formulae that he had written down on two of his large slatesdescribing the mathematics underlying the spectacular balloon flight undertaken onJune 5, 1783, by the brothers Montgoler in Paris were found on the day of his death.Worked out and prepared for publication by his son, Johann Albrecht, they becamethe last article of Euler; it appeared in the 1784 volume of the M\u00b4emoires. A stream of memoirs, however, all queued up at the presses of the Academy, were still to bepublished for nearly fty years after Euler's death. 3. HisWorks. In the face of the enormous volume of Euler's writings, we content ourselves with briefly identifying his principal works, and then select, and describe inmore detail, a few of Euler's prominent results in order to convey a flavor of his workand some of its characteristic features. The papers will be cited by their Enestr\u00a8 om- Index numbers (E-numbers). 3.1. ThePeriodinBasel. During the relatively short time of Euler's creative activity in Basel, he published two papers (E1, E3) in the Acta Eruditorum (Leipzig), one on isochronous curves, the other on so-called reciprocal curves, both influencedby Johann Bernoulli, and the work on the Paris Academy prize question (E4). Themajor work of this period is probably his Dissertatio physica de sono (E2), which he submitted in support of his application to the physics chair at the University of Baseland had printed in 1727 in Basel. In it, Euler discusses the nature and propagation ofLEONHARD EULER: HIS LIFE, THE MAN, AND HIS WORKS 11 Fig.9PhysicalDissertationonSound, 1727. (ReprintedwithpermissionfromBirkh\u00a8 auserVerlag.) sound, in particular the speed of sound, and also the generation of sound by musical instruments. Some of this work is preliminary and has been revisited by Euler in hisTentamen (cf. section 3.2.1) and, thirty years later, in several memoirs (E305-E307). 3.2. FirstSt.PetersburgPeriod. In spite of the serious setbacks in health, Eu- ler's creative output during this period is nothing short of astonishing. Major workson mechanics, music theory, and naval architecture are interspersed with some 70memoirs on a great variety of topics that run from analysis and number theory toconcrete problems in physics, mechanics, and astronomy. An account of the mathe-matical work during this period is given in Sandifer [22]. Fig.10Mechanics, 1736. (Reprinted of a far-reaching program, outlined by Euler in Vol. I, sect. 98, of composing a com-prehensive treatment of all aspects of mechanics, including the mechanics of rigid,flexible, and elastic bodies, as well as fluid mechanics and celestial mechanics. Thepresent work is restricted almost entirely to the dynamics of a point mass, to its free12 WALTER GAUTSCHI motion in Vol. I and constrained motion in Vol. II. In either case the motion may take place either in a vacuum or in a resisting medium. The novelty of the Mechan- icaconsists in the systematic use of (the then new) dierential and integral calculus, including dierential equations, and in this sense it represents the rst treatise onwhat is now called analytic (or rational) mechanics. It had won the praise of manyleading scientists of the time, Johann Bernoulli among them, who said of the workthat \"it does honor to Euler's genius and acknowledges Euler's mechanics to be \"the rst great work where Analysis has been applied to the science of motion.\" Implementationand systematic treatment of the rest of Euler's program, never entirely completed,occupied him throughout much of his life. Fig.11Tentamen, 1739 (1731) . (Reprinted with permission from Birkh\u00a8 auser Verlag.) It is evident from Euler's notebooks that he thought a great deal about music and musical composition while still in Basel and had plans to write a book on thesubject. These plans matured only later in St. Petersburg and gave rise to the Ten- tamen novae theoriae musicae (E33), , published in 1739 but completed already in 1731. (An English translation was made availableby Smith [27, pp. 21-347].) The work opens with a discussion of the nature of soundas vibrations of air particles, including the propagation of sound, the physiology ofauditory perception, and the generation of sound by string and wind instruments.The core of the work, however, deals with a theory of pleasure that music can evoke,which Euler develops by assigning to a tone interval, a chord, or a succession of such,a numerical value\u2014the \"degree\"\u2014which is to measure the agreeableness, or pleasure,of the respective musical construct: the lower the degree, the more pleasure. This isdone in the context of Euler's favorite diatonic-chromatic temperament, but a com-plete mathematical theory of temperaments, both antique and contemporary ones, isalso given. In trying to make music an exact science, Euler was not alone: Descartes and Mersenne did the same before him, as did d'Alembert and many others after him(cf. a second milestone in his development of rational mechanics. In it, he sets forth the principles of hydrostaticsand develops a theory of equilibrium and oscillations about the equilibrium of three-LEONHARD EULER: HIS LIFE, THE MAN, AND HIS WORKS 13 Fig.12Naval Science, 1749 (1740-1741) . dimensional bodies submerged in water. This already contains the beginnings of the second volume applies the theory to ships, shipbuilding, and navigation. 3.2.2. SelectaEuleriana.Selectio1. TheBaselProblem. This is the name that has become attached to the problem of determining the sum of the reciprocal squares, (3.1) 1+1 22+1 32+1 42+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. In modern terminology, this is called the zeta function of 2, where more generally (3.2) (s)=1+1 2s+1 3s+1 4s+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. The problem had stumped the leading mathematicians of the time\u2014Leibniz, Stirling, de Moivre, and all the Bernoullis\u2014until Euler came along. Typically for Euler, hestarted,usinghistremendousdexterityofcalculationandhisadroitnessinspeedingupslowly converging series, to calculate (2) in E20 to seven decimal places (cf. Gautschi [13, sect. 2]). (Stirling, already in 1730, actually calculated the series to nine decimalplaces, but Euler did not yet know this.) The breakthrough came in 1735 (publishedas E41 in 1740) when he showed by a brilliant but daring procedure (using Newton'sidentities for polynomials of innite degree!) that (2) = 2 6. Spectacular as this achievement was, Euler went on to use the same method, with considerably more labor, to determine (s) for all even s=2nup to 12. He found (2n) to be always a rational number multiplied by the 2 nth power of . It was in connection with the Basel problem that Euler in 1732 discovered a general summa-tion procedure, found independently by Maclaurin in 1738, and promptly used it tocalculate (2) to twenty decimal places (cf. Gautschi Central Library, Ryhiner Collection.) managed to place his approach on a more solid footing, using his own partial fraction expansion of the cotangent function, and he succeeded, in E130 (see also E212, PartII, Chap. 5, p. 324), to prove the general formula (3.3) (2n)=2 2n1 (2n)!|B2n|2n. Here, B2nare the Bernoulli numbers (introduced Bernoulli in his Ars con- jectandi), which Euler already encountered in his general summation formula. Euler also tried odd values of s, but wrote in a letter to Johann Bernoulli that \"the odd powers I cannot sum, and I don't believe that their sums depend on thequadrature of the circle [that is, on ]\" (Fellmann [9, p. 84, footnote 56]). The problem in this case, as a matter of fact, is still open today. The Z\u00a8 urich historian Eduard Fueter once wrote that \"where mathematical reason could not go any further,this for Euler was where the kingdom of God began.\" Could it be that here was aninstance where Euler felt a brush with the kingdom of God? Selectio2.PrimeNumbersandtheZetaFunction. Let P={2,3,5,7,11,13,17,...} be the set of all prime numbers, i.e., the integers >1 that are divisible only by 1 and themselves. Euler's fascination with prime numbers started quite early andcontinued throughout his life, even though the rest of the mathematical world at thetime(Lagrangeexcluded!)wasratherindierenttoproblemsofthiskind. Anexampleof his profound insight into the theory of numbers is the discovery in 1737 (E72) ofthe fabulous product formula (3.4)/productdisplay pP1 11/ps=(s),s >1, connecting prime numbers with the zeta function (3.2). How did he do it? Simply by starting with the zeta function and peeling away, layer after layer, all the terms whose integers in the denominators are divisible by a prime! Thus, from (s)=1+1 2s+1 3s+1 4s+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,LEONHARD EULER: HIS LIFE, THE MAN, AND HIS WORKS 15 dividing by 2sand subtracting, one gets /parenleftbigg 11 2s/parenrightbigg (s)=1+1 3s+1 5s+1 7s+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. All the denominator integers divisible by 2 are gone. Doing the same with the next prime, 3, i.e., dividing the last equation by 3sand subtracting, one gets /parenleftbigg 11 2s/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg 7s+1 11s+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, where all integers divisible by 3 are gone. After continuing in this way ad innitum, everything will be gone except for the rst term, 1, /productdisplay pP/parenleftbigg 11 ps/parenrightbigg (s)=1 . But this is (3.4)! Theresultprovidesaneatanalyticproofofthefact(alreadyknowntotheGreeks) that the number of \"analytic number theory\"\u2014in fact paved the way to important later developments in the distribution of primes. Selectio3. TheGammaFunction. Following a correspondence in 1729 with Goldbach, Euler in E19 considers the problem of interpolating the sequence of facto-rials (3.5) n!=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n, n=1,2,3,..., at noninteger values of the argument. Euler quickly realized that this cannot be done algebraically, but requires \"transcendentals,\" that is, calculus. He writes n!a n innite product, (3.6)1\u00b72 n 1+n\u00b721n\u00b73n 2+n\u00b731n\u00b74n 3+n\u00b741n\u00b75n 4+n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, which formally, by multiplying out the numerators, can be seen to be the ratio of two innite products, 1 \u00b72\u00b73\u00b74\u00b75\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7and ( n+ 1)( n+ 2)( n+3 )\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, which indeed reduces to (3.5). Now for n=1 2, Euler manages to manipulate the innite product (3.6) into the square root of an innite product for /4 due to John Wallis; therefore, 1 2!=1 2. This is why Euler knew that some kind of integration was necessary to solve the problem. By a stroke of insight, Euler takes the integral/integraltext1 0xe(1x)ndx\u2014up to the factor 1/n!, the n-times iterated integral of xe, where eis an arbitrary number (not the basis of the natural logarithms!)\u2014and nds the formula (3.7) ( e+n+1)/integraldisplay1 0xe(1x)ndx=n!

Iff=1 g= 0, then on the right we have n!; on the left, we have to determine the limit as f1,g0, which Euler takes to be the desired interpolant, since it is16 WALTER GAUTSCHI meaningful also for noninteger n. Skillfully, as always, Euler carries out the limit by rst changing variables, x=tg/(f+g), to obtain f+(n+1)g f+g/integraldisplay1 0/parenleftbigg1tg/(f+g) g/parenrightbiggn dt, and then doing the limit as g0 with f= 1 by the Bernoulli-l'H opital rule. The result is/integraltext1 0(lnt)ndt.

The latter can be beautifully expressed in terms of the gamma function by B(x, y)=(x)(y) (x+y), which is nothing but (3.7) for e=x1,n=y1.LEONHARD EULER: HIS LIFE, THE MAN, AND HIS WORKS 17 For a recent historical essay on the gamma function, see Srinivasan [28]. Selectio4. Euler'sConstant. It is generally acknowledged that, aside from the imaginary unit i=1, the two most important constants in mathematics are =3.1415 ..., the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and e= 2.7182 ..., the basis of the natural logarithms, sometimes named after Euler. They pop up everywhere, often quite unexpectedly. The 19th-century logician Auguste deMorgan said about that \"it comes on many occasions through the window and through the door, sometimes even down the chimney.\" The third most importantconstant is undoubtedly Euler's constant introduced by him in 1740 in E43. Of the three together\u2014the \"holy trinity,\" as they are sometimes called\u2014the last one,, is the most mysterious one, since its arithmetic nature, in contrast to ande,i s still shrouded in obscurity. It is not even known whether is rational, even though most likely it is not; if it were, say, equal to p/qin reduced form, then high-precision continued fraction calculations of have shown that qwould have to be larger than 10 244,663(Haible 2+1 3\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+1 nlnn/parenrightbigg =0.57721 .... It has been known as early as the 14th century that the harmonic series diverges, but a rigorous proof of it is usually attributed to Jakob Bernoulli, who also mentionedanother proof by his younger brother Johann, which, however, is not entirely satis-factory. At any rate, Euler, in dening his constant and showing it to be nite, putsin evidence not only the divergence of the harmonic series, but also its logarithmicrate of divergence. Beyond this, using his general summation formula (mentioned inSelectio 1), he computes to 16 correct decimal places (cf. Gautschi [13, sect. 5.2]), and to equally many decimals the sum of the rst million terms of the harmonic series!Since later (in 1790) Lorenzo Mascheroni also considered Euler's constant, gave it thename , and computed it to 32 decimal places (of which, curiously, the 19th, 20th, and 21st are incorrect), the term \"Euler-Mascheroni constant\" is also in use. As oftoday, it appears that has been computed to 108 million decimal places, compared to over 2 \u00d710 11decimals for and 50.1 billion for e. An inspiring tale surrounding Euler's constant can be found in Havil [15], and a rather encyclopedic account in Kr\u00a8 amer [18]. After all these spectacular achievements, the numerous other memoirs written on many dierent topics, and his responsibilities at the Academy, it is incredible thatEuler still had the time and stamina to write a 300-page volume on elementary arith-meticforuseintheSt.Petersburggymnasia. HowfortunatewerethoseSt.Petersburgkids for having had Euler as their teacher! 3.3. Berlin. Next to some 280 memoirs, many quite important, and consultation on engineering and technology projects, this period saw the creation of a number ofepochal scientic treatises and a highly successful and popular work on the philosophyof science. 3.3.1.

In 1744 (E65), and later in improved approachof Lagrange, Euler vastly generalizes this problem, thereby creating an entirely newbranch of mathematics, called (already by Euler) the \"calculus of variations.\" Hederives his famous Euler equation: a necessary condition in the form of a dierentialequation that any solution of the problem must satisfy. Typically for Euler, he illus-trates this by many\u2014some hundred!\u2014examples, among them the principle of leastaction that caused so much turmoil in the mid-1700s (cf. section 2.3). Two smaller treatises, one on planetary and cometary trajectories (E66) and another on optics (E88), at about the same time (1744, resp., 1746). Thelatter is of historical interest insofar as it started the debate of Newton's particleversus Euler's own wavetheory of light. In deference to his master, king Frederick II, Euler translated an important work on ballistics by the Englishman Benjamin Robins, even though the latter had beenunfairly critical of Euler's Mechanica of 1736. He added, however, so many commen- taries and explanatory notes (also corrections!) that the resulting book\u2014his Artillerie of 1745 (E77)\u2014is about ve times the size of the original. Niklaus Fuss in his 1783Eulogyof Euler (cf. Opera omnia , Ser. I, Vol. 1, pp. xliii-xcv) remarks: \" ...the only revenge [Euler] took against his adversary because of the old injustice consists in hav-ing made [Robins's] work so famous as, without him, it would never have become.\" Thetwo-volume important precursor of analysis as we know it today. In the rst volume of the Introductio , after a treatment of elementary functions, Euler summarizes his many discoveries in the areas of innite series, innite products,partition of numbers, and continued fractions. On several occasions, he uses the fun-damental theorem of algebra, clearly states it, but does not prove it. He develops aclear concept of function\u2014real- as well as complex-valued\u2014and emphasizes the fun-damental role played in analysis by the number eand the exponential and logarithmLEONHARD EULER: HIS LIFE, THE MAN, AND HIS WORKS 19 Fig.16Innitesimal Analysis, 1748, and Dierential and Integral Calculus, 1755,1763,1773. (Reprinted with permission from Birkh\u00a8 auser Verlag.) functions. The second volume is devoted to analytic geometry: the theory of algebraic curves and surfaces. Dierential Calculus also has two parts, the rst being devoted to the calculus of dierences and dierentials, the second to the theory of power series and summa-tion formulae, with many examples given for each. Chapter 4 of the second part,incidentally, contains the rst example, in print, of a Fourier series; cf. also p. 297oftheOpera omnia , Ser. I, Vol. 10. Another chapter deals with Newton's method, and improvements thereof, for solving nonlinear equations, and still another with criteriafor algebraic equations to have only real roots. The three-volume Integral Calculus is a huge foray into the realm of quadrature and dierential equations. In the rst volume, Euler treats the quadrature (i.e., in-denite integration) of elementary functions and techniques for reducing the solutionof linear ordinary dierential equations to quadratures. In the second volume, hepresents, among other things, a detailed theory of the important linear second-orderdierential equations, and in the third volume a treatment, to the extent knownat the time (mostly through Euler's own work), of linear partial dierential equa-tions. A fourth volume, published posthumously in 1794, contains supplements to thepreceding for solvingarbitrary equations, and the more general Taylor series method,are embedded in Chapter 7of the second section of Volume 1. Euler's program for mechanics (cf. section 3.2.1) progressed steadily as he tackled the problem of developing a theory of the motion of solids. An important milestonein this eort was the memoir E177 in which was stated for the rst time, in fullgenerality, what today is called Newtonian mechanics. also called the \"Second Mechanics ,\" represents a summary of Euler's mechanical work up to this time. In addition to an improved exposition of his earlier mechanics of mass points(cf. section 3.2.1), it now contains the dierential equations (Euler's equations) ofmotion of a rigid body subject to external forces. Here, Euler introduces the originalidea of employing two coordinate systems\u2014one xed, the other moving, attached tothe body\u2014and deriving dierential equations for from Birkh\u00a8auser Verlag.) coordinate axes, now called the Euler angles. The intriguing motion of the spinning top is one of many examples worked out by Euler in detail. Later, in 1776, Euler returns to mechanics again with his seminal work E479, where one nds the denitive formulation of the principles of linear and angularmomentum. Throughout his years in Berlin and beyond, Euler was deeply occupied with geo- metric optics. His memoirs and books on this topic, including the monumental three-volume Dioptrics (E367, E386, E404), written mostly while still in Berlin, ll no fewer than seven volumes in his Opera omnia . A central theme and motivation of this work was the improvement of optical instruments like telescopes and microscopes, notablyways of eliminating chromatic and spherical aberration through intricate systems oflenses and interspaced fluids. Euler's philosophical views on science, religion, and ethics are expressed in over 200 letters written between 1760 and 1762 (in French) to a German princess and pub-lishedlaterin1768and1772(E343, E344, E417). (Forarecenteditionoftheseletters,LEONHARD EULER: HIS LIFE, THE MAN, AND HIS WORKS 21 see Euler [8].) While Euler's role as a philosopher may be controversial (even his best friend Daniel Bernoulli advised him to better deal with \"more sublime matters\"), hisLetters, written with extreme clarity and also accessible to people not trained in the sciences, \"even to the gentle sex,\" as Fuss remarks in his Eulogy, became an instant success and were translated into all major languages. 3.3.2. SelectaEuleriana.Selectio5. TheK \u00a8onigsbergBridgeProblem. The river Pregel, which flows through the Prussian city of K\u00a8 onigsberg, divides the city into an island and three distinct land masses, one in the north, one in the east, and one in the south. Thereare altogether seven bridges, arranged as shown in green on the left of Figure 19,connecting the three land masses with each other and with the island. The problemis this: Can one take a stroll from one point in the city to another by traversing eachbridge exactly once? In particular, can one return to the starting point in the samemanner? Evidently, this is a problem that cannot be dealt with by the traditional meth- ods of analysis and algebra. It requires a new kind of analysis that deemphasizesmetric properties in favor of positional properties. Euler solved the problem in 1735,published as E53 in 1741, by showing that such paths cannot exist. He does thisby an ingenious process of abstraction, associating with the given land and bridgeconguration (what today is called) a connected graph, i.e., a network of vertices andconnecting edges, each vertex representing a piece of land and each edge a bridge con-necting the respective pieces of land. In the problem at hand, there are four distinctpieces of land, hence four vertices, and they are connected with edges as shown onthe right of Figure 19. It is obvious what is meant by a path along edges from onevertex to another. A closed path is called a circuit, and paths or circuits are (today)called Eulerian if each edge is traversed exactly once. Euler recognized that in modern terminology a crucial concept here is the degree of a vertex, i.e., the number of edges emanating from it. If, in an arbitrary connected Fig.19The K\u00a8onigsberg bridge problem.

(The case n= 1 is impossible.) Since the K\u00a8onigsberg bridge graph has n= 4, we are in case (c), hence it is impossible to traverse the city in the manner required in the problem.

Selectio6.Euler'sBucklingFormula(1744). Inarstsupplementtohis Metho- dus(cf. Figure 15, left), Euler applies the calculus of variations to elasticity theory, specically to the bending of a rod subject to an axial load. He derives the criticalload under which the rod buckles. This load depends on the stiness constant of thematerial, on the way the rod is supported at either end, and it is inversely propor-tional to the square of the length of the rod. A particular conguration of two rodsloaded on top by a connecting bar (assumed to be of innite stiness) is shown inFigure 20, during the initial phase (left), and at the time of buckling (right). Here,the top end of the rods is slidably supported and the bottom end clamped. For avideo, see http://epubs.siam.org/sam-bin/getle/SIREV/articles/70271 02.avi. Fig.20The buckling of a rod. (Images and video courtesy of Wolfgang Ehlers.) The critical load is the rst elasto staticeigenvalue of the problem. Euler also calculates the eigenfrequencies of the rod's transversal oscillations, and the associated eigenfunctions, which determine the shapes of thedeformed rod. Selectio7.EulerFlow. In a series of three memoirs, E225-E227, all published in 1757,andanotherthreepapers(E258,E396,E409),Eulergavehisdenitivetreatmentof continuum and fluid mechanics, the culmination of a number of earlier memoirs onthe subject. It contains the celebrated Euler equations, expressing the conservation ofmass, momentum, and energy. In two (three) dimensions, these constitute a systemof four (ve) nonlinear hyperbolic partial dierential equations, which have to besolved, given appropriate initial and boundary conditions. Naturally, in Euler's time,LEONHARD EULER: HIS LIFE, THE MAN, AND HIS WORKS 23 (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig.21Transonic Euler flow at Mach .85about a cylinder. (Images and video courtesy of Nicola Botta.) this was virtually impossible to do, except in very special cases, and indeed Euler in the introduction to E226 had to write that \"if there remain any diculties, theyshall not be on the side of mechanics, but solely on the side of analysis: for thisscience has not yet been carried to the degree of perfection which would be necessaryin order to develop analytic formulae which include the principles of the motion offluids.\" Nowadays, however, the Euler equations are widely being used in computersimulation of fluids. An example is the asymmetric flow of a compressible, inviscid fluid about a cir- cular cylinder at transonic speed, calculated in 1995 by [4]. Four color-codedsnapshots of the two-dimensional flow (vorticity contour lines), as it develops be-hind the cylinder, are shown in Figure 21: (a) the onset of the flow, (b) a regi-men of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, (c) the flow after breakdown of symmetry, and(d) the formation of vortex pairs. (The scaling of (c) and (d) diers from that of(a) and (b).) For the complete Euler-flow Selectio8. Euler'sPolyhedralFormula(1758). Ethe number of edges, and Fthe number of faces. Thus, in the case of an octahedron (cf. Figure 22), one has V=6,E= 12, and F= 8. Mentioned in 1750 in a letter to Goldbach, and later published in E231, Euler proves for the rst time the extremelysimple but stunning formula (3.11) VE+F=2.24 WALTER GAUTSCHI Fig.22Octahedron.

The way he did it is to chop o triangular pyramids from the polyhedron, one after another, in such a manner that the sum on the left of (3.11) remains the same.Once he got it chopped down to a tetrahedron, that sum is easily seen to be 2.(For a critical and historical review of Euler's proof, see Francese and Richeson [11].)Descartes, some 100 years earlier, already knew, but did not prove, something closeto the formula (3.11). The expression on the left-hand side of (3.11) is an example of an Euler character- istics, atopologicalinvariantforpolyhedra. Eulercharacteristicshavebeendenedformany other topological spaces and today still come up often in homological algebra. The generalization to higher-dimensional polytopes leads to what is called Euler- Poincar\u00b4e characteristics, where the pattern of alternating signs can be seen to come from the dimensionality of the respective facets, something already noted in 1852 The begins with a letter Euler wrote in 1734 to Daniel Bernoulli, in which he considered the (somewhat bizarre) problemof interpolating the common logarithm log xat the points x r=1 0r,r=0,1,2,.... He essentially writes down Newton's interpolation series S(x) (without mentioning Newton by name) and remarks that, when x= 9, the series converges quickly, but to a wrong value, S(9)/negationslash= log9 (cf. Gautschi [12]). Rather than losing interest in the problem, Euler must have begun pondering the question about the nature of the limitfunction S(x): what is it, if not the logarithm? Almosttwentyyearslater, in1753, hereturnedtothisprobleminE190, nowmore generally for the logarithm to base a>1, and studied the respective limit function S(x;a) in great detail. Intuitively, he must have perceived its importance. Today we know (Koelink and Van Assche [17]) that it can be thought of as a q-analogue of the logarithm, where q=1/a, and some of the identities derived by Euler (in part already contained in Vol. 1, Chap. 16 of his Introductio ) are in fact special cases of the q-binomial theorem\u2014a centerpiece of q-theory in combinatorial analysis and physics. Thus, Euler must be counted among the precursors of q-theory, which was only developed about 100 years later by Heinrich Eduard Heine.LEONHARD EULER: HIS LIFE, THE MAN, AND HIS WORKS 25 Selectio10. TheEuler-FermatTheoremandCryptology. LetNbe the set of positive integers, and (n),nN, Euler's totient function, that is, the number of integers 1 ,2,3,...,ncoprime to n. The Euler-Fermat theorem, published 1763 as E271, states that for any aNcoprime to n, (3.12) a(n)1 (mod n). It generalizes the \"little Fermat\" theorem, which is the case n=pa prime number, and therefore (p)=p1. In cryptography, one is interested in the secure transmission of messages, whereby a message Mis transmitted from a sender to the receiver in encrypted form: The sender encodes the message MintoE, whereupon the receiver has to decode Eback into M. It is convenient to think of Ma san u m b e ri n N, for example, the number obtained by replacing each letter, character, and space in the text by its ASCII code.The encrypted message Eis then E=f(M), where f:NNis some function on N. The problem is to nd a function fthat can be computed by the general public but is extremely dicult to invert (i.e., to obtain Mfrom E), unless one is in the possession of a secret key associated with the function f. A solution to this problem is the now widely used RSA encryption scheme (named after its inventors R. Rivet, A. Shamir, and L. Adleman). To encode the message M, one selects two distinct (and very large) prime numbers p, qand denes a \"modulus\" n=pqassumed to be larger than M. Then an integer e,1<e<(n), is chosen with ecoprime to (n). The numbers n, eform the \"public key,\" i.e., they are known to the general public. The encoded message MisE=f(M), where f(M)M e(mod n). The \"private key\" is n, d, where dis such that de1 (mod (n)). To compute d, one needs to know pandq, since n=pq,(n)=( p1)(q1). The general public, however, knows only n, so must factor ninto prime numbers to get a hold of p, q.I f nis suciently large, say n>10300, this, today, is virtually impossible. The person who selected pandq, on the other hand, is in possession of d, and can decode the ciphertext Eas follows, Ed(Me)d(mod n)Med(mod n)MN(n)+1(mod n),NN, by the choice of d. Using now the Euler-Fermat theorem (3.12), with a=MN(almost certainly coprime to n=pqor can made so), one gets EdMa(n)(mod n)M(mod n)=M, since M<n. (It is true that M,e,n, and dare typically very large numbers so that the computations described may seem formidable. There are, however, ecientschemes to execute them; see, e.g., Silverman [26, Chaps. 16, 17].) 3.4. SecondSt.PetersburgPeriod. This may well be Euler's most productive period, with well over 400 published works to his credit, not only on each of thetopics already mentioned, but also on geometry, probability theory and statistics,cartography, and even widow's pension funds and agriculture. In this enormous bodyof work there gure three treatises on algebra, lunar theory, and naval science, andwhat appear to be fragments of major treatises on (E792), naturalphilosophy (E842), and dioptrics (E845). 3.4.1.

(The French translation by Johann III Bernoulli includes a long supplement byLagrange containing an expos\u00b4 e on the arithmetic theory of continued fractions and many addenda to the last section of the Algebradealing with Diophantine equations.) Euler wrote this 500-page work to introduce the absolute beginner into the realm of algebra. He dictated the work to a young man\u2014a tailor's apprentice\u2014whom hebrought with him from Berlin, and who (according to the preface of the work) \"wasfairly good at computing, but beyond that did not have the slightest notion aboutmathematics .... Asfarashisin tellect is concerned, he belonged among the mediocre minds.\" Nevertheless, it is said that, when the work was completed, he understoodeverything perfectly well and was able to solve algebraic problems posed to him withgreat ease. It is indeed a delight to witness in this work Euler's magnicent didactic skill, to watch him progress in ever so small steps from the basic principles of arithmetic toalgebraic (up to quartic) equations, and nally to the beautiful art of Diophantineanalysis. Equally delightful is to see how the theory is illustrated by numerous well-chosen examples, many taken from everyday life. The orbit of the moon, with all its irregularities, had long fascinated mathemati- cians like Clairaut and d'Alembert, as Lunar Theory.\" The theory he devel- oped there, while tentative, provided astronomers with formulae needed to preparelunar tables, which in turn served seafaring nations for over a century with accuratenavigational aids. Euler's denitive work on the subject, however, is his \"SecondLunar Theory\" (E418) of 1772, a monumental work dealing in a more eective waythan before with the dicult three-body problem, i.e., the study of the motion ofthree bodies\u2014in this case the sun, the earth, and the moon, thought of as pointmasses\u2014moving under the influence of mutual gravitational forces. Already Newtonis reputed to have said that \"an exact solution of the three-body problem exceeds,if I am not mistaken, the power of any human mind.\" Today it is known, indeed,that an exact solution is not possible. Euler grapples with the problem by intro-ducing appropriate variables, again choosing two coordinate systems\u2014one xed, theother moving\u2014applying processes of successive approximation, and making use, whenneeded, of observational data.LEONHARD EULER: HIS LIFE, THE MAN, AND WORKS 27 Fig.24SecondLunarTheory, 1772,andSecondTheoryofShips, 1773. (Reprintedwithpermission from omnia , Ser. II, Vol. 22, p. xxviii), \"all later progress in celestial mechanics is based, more or less, on the ideas contained in theworks of Euler, [and the later works of] Laplace and Lagrange.\" TheTh\u00b4eorie complete de la construction et de la manuvre des vaisseaux (E426), also called the \"Second Theory of Ships,\" is a work that treats the topic indicatedin the title for people having no or little mathematical knowledge, in particular forthe sailors themselves. Not surprisingly, given the level of presentation and the au-thor's extraordinary didactic skill, the work proved to be very successful. The Frenchmaritime and nance minister (and famous economist) Anne Robert Jacques Tur-got proposed to King Louis XVI that all students in marine schools (and also thosein schools of artillery) be required to study Euler's relevant treatises. Very likely,Napol\u00b4eon Bonaparte was one of those students. The king even paid Euler 1,000 rubles for the privilege of having the works reprinted, and czarina Catherine II, notwanting to be outdone by the king, doubled the amount and pitched in an additional2,000 rubles! 3.4.2. SelectaEuleriana.Selectio11.PartitionofNumbers. Euler's interest in the partition of numbers, i.e., in expressing an integer as a sum of integers from some given set, goes back to1740 when Philippe Naud\u00b4 e the younger, of the Berlin Academy, in a letter to Euler asked in how many ways the integer 50 can be written as a sum of seven dierentpositive integers. This gave rise to a series of memoirs, spanning a time interval ofabout 20 years, beginning with E158, published (with a delay of 10 years) in 1751,and ending with E394, published in 1770. In this work, Euler almost single-handedlycreated the theory of partition. A systematic exposition of part of this work can alsobe found in Volume 1, Chapter 16, of his Introductio (cf. section 3.3.1) and before him (cf. Scharlau [24, p. 141f]), attacked problems of this type by a brilliant use of generating functions and formal power series. Thus, inthe case of Naud\u00b4 e's inquiry, in Euler's hands this becomes the problem of nding the coecient of z 7x50in the expansion of (1 + xz)(1 + x2z)(1 + x3z)(1 + x4z)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, for28 WALTER GAUTSCHI which Euler nds the answer 522, \"a most perfect solution of Naud\u00b4 e's problem,\" as he proudly wrote (at the end of section 19 of E158). In the context of \"unrestricted par-titions,\" Euler in the penultimate paragraph of E158 surprises with the marvelousexpansion (1x)(1x 2)(1x3)(1x4)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7=/summationdisplay n=(1)nxn(3n1)/2, which he conjectured as early as 1742 by numerical computation, and then labored on it for almost ten years to nd a proof (in E244, a \"masterpiece\" according to C. G. J.Jacobi). He used (in E175) the expansion to obtain his astonishing recurrence relationfors(n), the sum of divisors of n(including 1 and n), and (in E191) the reciprocal expansion to obtain a similar recurrence for the partition function p(n), the number of ways ncan be written as a sum of natural numbers. In E394, Euler considers the problem of how many ways any given number can be thrown by nordinary dice. He shows that the answer is given by the appropriate coecient in the expansion of(x+x 2+x3+x4+x5+x6)n. Of course, Euler also solves the same problem for more general dice having an arbitrary number of sides, which may even dier from die todie. Euler's magnicent work on partitions has not found much response among his contemporaries; it was only in the 20th century that his work was continued andsignicantly expanded by such mathematicians as Ramanujan, Hardy, and Rogers. Selectio12.Euler'sGearTransmission. In connection with the design of water turbines, Euler developed optimal proles for teeth in cogwheels that transmit motionwith a minimum of resistance and noise (E330, OII.17, pp. 196-219). These prolesinvolve segments of circular evolvents as shown in Figure 25. For the gear in action,see the video at http://epubs.siam.org/sam-bin/getle/SIREV/articles/70271 04.avi. The technical realization of this design took shape only later in what is called the involute gear. Euler not only is the inventor of this kind of gear, but he alsoanticipated the underlying geometric equations now usually called the Euler-Savaryequations. Fig.25Euler gear, 1767.

The key toward explaining the motion are Euler's equations, a set of dierential equations involving the Euler angles and other parameters. The technical details ofthe motion, though, are still being analyzed today (cf., e.g., Le Saux, Leine, andGlocker [19] and the literature cited therein). 4. TheMan.4.1. Personality. From various testimonials of Euler's contemporaries, and also, of course, from Euler's extensive correspondence, one can form a fairly accurate pic-ture of Euler's personality. A valuable source is the eulogy of Niklaus Fuss ( Opera omnia, Ser. I, Vol. 1, pp. xliii-xcv), who during the last ten years of Euler's life had seen him regularly, almost on a daily basis, as one of his assistants. Also based on per-sonal acquaintance is the eulogy of the marquis Nicolas de Condorcet ( Opera omnia , Ser. III, Vol. 12, pp. 287-310), which, however, deals more with Euler's work. Eulercomes across as a modest, inconspicuous, uncomplicated, yet cheerful and He was down-to-earth and upright; \"honesty and uncompromising rectitude,acknowledged Swiss national virtues, he possessed to a superior degree,\" writes Fuss.Euler never dis avowed\u2014in fact was proud of\u2014his Swiss heritage. Fuss (who also originated from Basel) recalled that Euler \"always retained the Basel dialect withall the peculiarities of its idiom. Often he amused himself to recall for me certainprovincialisms and gures of speech, or mix into his parlance Basel expressions whose30 WALTER GAUTSCHI use and meaning I had long forgotten.\" He even made sure that he and his children retained the Basel civic rights. Feelings of rancor, due to either priority issues or unfair criticism, were totally foreign to Euler. When Maclaurin, for example, discovered the well-known summa-tion formula which Euler obtained six years earlier, Euler did not object, let alonecomplain, when for some time the formula was generally referred to as the \"Maclau-rin summation formula.\" It may even have pleased him that others hit upon thesame fortunate idea. In due time, of course, the formula became justly known as theEuler-Maclaurin summation formula. Another example is Maupertuis's claim for theprinciple of least action (cf. section 2.3), which Euler had already enunciated before,much more clearly and exhaustively; yet Euler remained supportive of Maupertuis.Euler's forgiving way of reacting to Robins's criticism of the Mechanica has already been mentioned in section 3.3.1. Sharing ideas with others and letting others take part in the process of discovery is another noble trait of Euler. A case in point is the way he put on hold his alreadyextensive work on hydrodynamics, so that his friend Daniel Bernoulli, who was work-ing on the same topic, could complete and publish his own Hydrodynamics rst! It became a classic. An important aspect of Euler's personality is his religiousness: By his upbringing in the Riehen parish environment, he was a devout protestant and even served asan elder in one of the protestant communities in Berlin. Indeed, he felt increasinglyuncomfortable and frustrated in the company of so many \"free-spirits\"\u2014as he andothers called the followers of French enlightenment\u2014that populated and began todominate the Berlin Academy. He gave vent to his feelings in the (anonymously pub-lished) pamphlet Rettung Vol. 12, pp. 267-286). This frustration may well have had something to do with his atypically harsh treatment of Johann Samuel K\u00a8 onig in the dispute about the Euler/Maupertuis principle of least action (cf. section 2.3). Itmay also have been one, and not the least, of the reasons why Euler left Berlin andreturned to St. Petersburg. 4.2. Intellect. TherearetwooutstandingqualitiesinEuler'sintellect: aphenom- enal memory, coupled with an unusual power of mental calculation, and an ease inconcentrating on mental work irrespective of any hustle and bustle going on aroundhim: \"A child on the knees, a cat on his back, that's how he wrote his immortalworks,\" recounts Dieudonn\u00b4 e Thi\u00b4ebault, the French linguist and condant of Frederick II. With regard to memory, the story is well known of Euler's ability, even at anadvanced age, to recite by heart all the verses of Virgil's Aeneid. One of these, Euler says in a memoir, has given him the rst ideas in solving a problem in mechanics.Niklaus Fuss also tells us that during a sleepless night, Euler mentally calculated therst six powers of all the numbers less than twenty (less than 100 in Condorcet'saccount), and several days later was able to recall the answers without hesitation.\"Euler calculates as other people breathe,\" Condorcet wrote. Equipped with such intellectual gifts, it is not surprising that Euler was extremely well read. In Fuss's words, he possessed to a high degree what commonly is called erudition; he had read the best writers ofantique Rome; the older mathematical literaturewas very well known to him; he was well versed in the history ofall timesand all people. Even about medical and herbal remedies, and chemistry,he knew more than one could expect from a scholar who doesn't makethese sciences a special subject ofhis study.LEONHARD EULER: HIS LIFE, THE MAN, AND HIS WORKS 31 Many visitors who came to see Euler went away\"with a mixture of astonishment and admiration. They could not understand how a man who during half a centuryseemed to have occupied himself solely with discoveries in the natural sciences andmathematics could retain so many facts that to him were useless and foreign to thesubject of his researches.\" 4.3. Craftsmanship. Euler's writings have the marks of a superb expositor. He always strove for utmost clarity and simplicity, and he often revisited earlier workwhen he felt they were lacking in these qualities. Characteristically, he will proceedfrom very simple examples to ever more complicated ones before eventually revealingthe underlying theory in its full splendor. Yet, in his quest for discovery, he could befearless, even reckless, but owing to his secure instinct, he rarely went astray whenhis argumentation became hasty. He had an eye for what is essential and unifying. Inmechanics, Gleb Konstantinovich Mikhailov [20, p. of systematizing and generalizing scientic ideas, which allowed him to presentlarge parts of mechanics in a relatively denitive form.\" Euler was open and receptiveto new ideas. In Andr\u00b4 e Weil [30, pp. 132-133], . . . what rst is striking about Euler is his extraordinary quickness in catching hold ofany suggestion, wherever it came f rom ....There is not one ofthese suggestions which in Euler's hands has not become the pointofdeparture ofan impressive series ofresearches ....Another thing, not less striking, is that Euler never abandons a research topic, once it hasexcited his curiosity; on the contrary, he returns to it, relentlessly, in orderto deepen and broaden it on each revisit. Even ifall problems related tosuch a topic seem to be resolved, he never ceases until the end ofhis lif eto nd proofs that are \"more natural,\" \"simpler,\" \"more direct.\" 4.4. Epilogue. In closing, let me cite the text (translated from German)\u2014concise but to the point\u2014that Otto Spiess had inscribed on a memorial plaque attached nearthe house in Riehen in which Euler grew up: LEONHARD EULER 1707-1783 Mathematician, physicist, engineer, astronomer and philosopher, spent his youth in Riehen. He was a great scholar and a kind man. 32 WALTER GAUTSCHI 5. FurtherReading. For readers interested in more details, we recommend the authoritative scientic (yet formula-free!) biography by Fellmann [10], the essays inthe recent book by Henry [16], and several accounts on Euler and parts of his have recently the U.S. Euler Archive, http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/ euler, also provides detailed information about Euler's complete works, arranged by their E-numbers.
