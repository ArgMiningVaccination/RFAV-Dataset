VILNIUS \u2014 In Ukraine and Belarus, coronavirus vaccination is more than just a health issue. The two countries are becoming a battleground with geopolitical stakes as Russia and China promote their vaccines in countries unable to afford pricier Western options. Ukraine, which flatly refuses to purchase Russia's vaccine to deny Moscow potential security leverage, is considering China as a supplier. Neighboring Belarus, by contrast, relies entirely on Russian support. Globally, the rollout of both jabs has sparked controversy, and neither has yet been approved by U.S. or EU regulators. But that hasn't stopped them from making inroads outside the West. Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, which counted production snags among other early difficulties, has had more take-up of late. Along with Belarus, [Hungary](https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-oks-oxford-astrazeneca-sputnik-coronavirus-vaccines/) and Serbia are two other European countries that have signed deals. South America is another target market for Sputnik. Argentina has signed up for [millions of doses](https://sputnikvaccine.com/newsroom/pressreleases/rdif-and-government-of-argentina-agree-to-supply-10-million-doses-of-the-sputnik-v-vaccine/), and Brazil is reportedly eyeing [getting production](https://tass.com/world/1248755) up and running. In the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates recently authorized the shot. You may like CoronaVac, China's leading vaccine, is developed by SinoVac, a company with close ties to the government. Aside from [Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-ukraine-vaccine/ukraine-signs-upfor-chinas-sinovac-vaccine-with-doses-expected-soon-idUSKBN294150?edition-redirect=uk), it has inked deals with the [Philippines](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-philippines-vaccin-idUSKBN29G0V2) and [Malaysia](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Philippines-secures-25m-doses-of-Sinovac-COVID-vaccine), while another Chinese vaccine, developed by state-owned company Sinopharm, is seeing uptake in countries like [Egypt](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3119056/coronavirus-egypt-launches-programme-using-chinas-sinopharm) and Morocco. And last Friday, Hungary became the [first EU country](https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-becomes-first-eu-country-to-authorize-chinese-coronavirus-vaccine/) to approve the Sinopharm jab. Minsk's gamble If Russia can sell Sputnik anywhere, it's to neighboring Belarus. After a [brutal crackdown](https://www.politico.eu/article/5-reasons-why-alexander-lukashenko-may-hang-on-to-power-in-belarus/) on the opposition and the refusal by Western nations to recognize the re-election of authoritarian Alexander Lukashenko for a sixth consecutive presidential term, the Kremlin remains his only ally in the region. Last week, Belarus kicked off its vaccination drive by distributing the country's first round of the Sputnik jab, consisting of 20,000 shots. This batch is part of a deal for over 170,000 doses \u2014 a tiny fraction of what's needed for a nation of 9.4 million \u2014 that Minsk concluded with Moscow last year. Minsk is also planning to start vaccine production at its own facilities by late March. [Kirill Dmitriev,](https://www.politico.eu/?p=1570750) head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund RDIF and the lead official running Sputnik's distribution worldwide, has pledged publicly that the plant \"will significantly simplify logistics and accelerate the pace of vaccination.\" However, not everyone in Belarus is convinced. Although the Belarusian authorities plan to vaccinate up to 1.2 million people by late March and aim for an inoculation rate of 60 percent of the population, they're making a risky bet, say critics. Andrei Vitushka, a well-known Belarusian intensive care specialist, lamented the \"political reasons\" behind Minsk's commitment to \"only one vaccine \u2014 the Russian one.\" \"It is bad not because there is something wrong with the vaccine,\" he said. \"Relying on one supplier postpones mass vaccination in Belarus.\" The country lacks ready-made facilities that can be used for Sputnik V production, he added. Russia's RDIF fund, as well as the Belarusian government and health ministry, declined to comment for this story on the state of the rollout. More broadly, reliance on Russia could also undermine Lukashenko's domestic political standing. Unprecedented post-election protests have shown not only that many Belarussians want Lukashenko to resign, but that pro-Western sentiment is on the rise. The authoritarian leader pledged in December to negotiate possible purchases from up to five or six other manufacturers \u2014 possibly acknowledging the country's need for vaccines \u2014 depending \"on the terms we can agree.\" Minsk, however, has offered almost no information about these possible supplies \u2014 with one exception: A January 26 statement by Lukashenko's media office, following his conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping, that China is also considering supplying Belarus with vaccines. The coronavirus, meanwhile, is taking a severe toll. Official data reports more than 240,000 infections since the start of the pandemic, with 1,700 fatalities. Local medical professionals and international organizations on the ground, however, suggest the numbers are in fact far worse. Last year, for example, when a U.N. statistical office assessed the country's death toll from April to June last year, the public was shocked by its report of a jump of 5,605 \"excess deaths\" compared to the same three months in 2019. The U.N. has yet to release more recent data, however. Meanwhile, the government statistics agency Belstat has suspended the publication of any death toll statistics from last spring. Kyiv's China strategy In Ukraine, the government plans to start vaccinations by mid-February, with a focus on health care professionals, care home residents and military personnel deployed in the eastern war-torn region of Donbas. But Kyiv is shunning the Sputnik jab, looking instead to CoronaVac. According to Health Minister Maksym Stepanov, Ukraine \u2014 a country of about 42 million \u2014 will secure 1.9 million doses of the Chinese vaccine The country is also eyeing Western vaccines. 210,000 shots of the BioNTech/Pfizer jab, supplied by the global COVAX scheme, are set be delivered in February, according to Stepanov. The government is finalizing talks \"with some other suppliers,\" he added, while declining to offer details, citing nondisclosure agreements. COVAX is one piece of Kyiv's broader vaccine strategy, which seeks to secure 8 million doses. But Ukraine, like many low and middle-income countries, may be left empty-handed if rich countries fail to step up and contribute to the [COVAX facility,](https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-vaccines-poor-countries-equal-access/) which was set up to ensure that vaccine access isn't limited to wealthy nations. Pavlo Kovtonyuk, head of the health care economics department at the Kyiv School of Economics and the country's former deputy health minister, warns COVAX isn't a \"very good\" option for Ukraine because it would leave the country depending on donors. This option also may not be enough to cover the population, he said, adding: \"We do not understand [at the current stage] which vaccines will be delivered and when.\" Kovtonyuk stressed his broader concern that Ukraine is \"an outsider\" to vaccination campaigns rolling out in Europe. \"It's not just that we cannot start the vaccination campaign,\" he said. \"We also have low rates of contracting [for vaccines] compared even to non-EU countries, such as Albania, Serbia or Montenegro.\" \"The situation is very difficult,\" he said, calling on the government to revamp its vaccine strategy to \"keep up with Europe.\" If it doesn't, he warned, the government could pay a political price as well as suffer a spiraling health crisis. The country, which has reported almost 1.2 million coronavirus cases and over 22,000 deaths so far, intends to complete its vaccination program by early 2022. Stepanov said the goal is to cover 60 percent to 70 percent of the population, but he doubts it can reach that share even if vaccines are plentiful. Given widespread vaccine skepticism, he says, the more likely figure is around 45 percent. Still, despite all the challenges in securing the jab, any chances of negotiations with Russia are \"completely ruled out,\" Stepanov insists. \"We are able to provide the Ukrainian people with safe vaccines from other global manufactures,\" he said. Kovtonyuk, for his part, backs the Ukrainian leadership's decision, noting that distrust among Ukrainians toward the Russian vaccine could pose a real public health problem. \"Many people would refuse to get vaccinated, even as the state pays,\" he said. \"In Ukraine, we know very well what hybrid war is,\" he said. \"Every tool will be used for aggression, for manipulation. I don't believe that Russia's vaccine supplies will be just about business.\" Carlo Martuscelli contributed reporting.
