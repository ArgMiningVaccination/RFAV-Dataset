Geographical Indications (GIs) Overview Article 22(1) of the Agreement on Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual P roperty Rights provides that \"[g]eographical indications are, for purposes of this Agreement, indications which identify a good as originating in the territory of a Member, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.\" USDA's GI -related Activities during Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) of the Department of Agriculture actively works with other Federal agenc ies, particularly the lead agencies USTR and USPTO, to monitor and directly engage with countries on the issue of geographical indications (GIs). USDA's main goal is to ensure GI protections do not disadvantage U.S. producers by unfairly granting protecti on to products with common names and generic terms, which could ultimately result in a loss of market access. During FY 2021, USDA engaged at the most senior levels with key foreign country counterparts to underscore concerns and counter harmful GI policie s, emphasizing the importance of transparency, adherence to internationally recognized standards, an opportunity to comment on any proposed GIs through a comment period, and fair evaluations. USDA worked with interagency partners to engage a number of countries to raise the importance of procedural fairness and transparency as well as preserving common terms for food products; the countries included Chile, the MERCOSUR countries, Saudi Arabia, China, the European Union (EU), Kenya, and Korea. Consortium for Common Food Names Activities Supported by USDA The information below represents notable actions taken by the Consortium for Common Food Names (CCFN) in FY 2021. The U.S. Dairy Export Council, on behalf of a number U.S. agricultural associations inclu ding the U.S. Meat Export Federation and California Wine Institute, established CCFN in 2013 to monitor and combat GI -related trade restrictions. These activities are partially supported by USDA's Market Access Program through a Global Broad - based Initiati ve. Since 2013, CCFN has received $200,000 in funding annually from USDA for these efforts. Each item listed helped preserve U.S. exporters' rights to use common food names. 7 CCFN coordinated responses to various ongoing EU FTA negotiations, including: o Australia - EU FTA: Attended and participated in the virtual stakeholder briefing event that was held on March 30, 2021. Questions were submitted to the officials hosting this event to pursue confirmation that Australia will abide by its prior internatio nal commitments with respect to GIs and generic usage. o Chile - EU FTA: CCFN participated on May 2021 in the stakeholder meeting organized by the Under -Secretariat of International Economic Relations of the Chilean government, to inform the public about t he status of GI negotiations in the ongoing EU -Chile FTA. CCFN submitted questions concerning the opposition and cancellation procedures that will be available under the Agreement, as well as provisions or guidelines regarding generic terms. o Vietnam - EU FTA: CCFN submitted a letter to Vietnam's National Office of Intellectual Property, copying the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Science and Technology, to urge further clarity and action on how Vietnam is implementing certain provisions of the EU -Vietnam FTA that pertain to grandfathered generic users. CCFN continued outreach with international organizations, raising the profile of common food names with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) as a new Director General and his team assumed leadership. CCFN's communications outlined the steps WIPO could take to provide greater balance on the issue of GIs in its programming and resulted in half of the speakers at their September 2021 Worldwide S ymposium on Geographical Indica tions addressing generic users' issues. CCFN participation focused on the impacts - on both local industries and trading partners - that result from GI restrictions on the use of generic terms. Comments also highlighted the need for stronger protections f or common names around the world and cited the lack of consistent policies and due process protections that limit generic users' rights. The panel was watched by approximately 300 participants. CCFN participated and collaborated on educational activities to raise awareness in foreign markets about the potential trade barriers that GIs may pose to local industries and trading partners. CCFN participated in the WIPO Working Group on the Development of the Lisbon System in November 2020, alongside 72 participants from various countries and industries. CCFN also presented on Geographical Indications, How to Achieve the Right Balance in their International Protection at the World Intellectual Property Forum in April 2021. This conference was attended by more than 1,500 people from over 30 countries. In addition, CCFN was a panelist at the June 2021 African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) GI Workshop, a webinar to educate intellectual prop erty officials in Africa about GI issues and the importance of ensuring that producers relying on generic terms retain the ability to use them; about 60 participants from the ARIPO 19 -country region participated in the event. 8 CCFN submitted comments to A ustralia, Mexico, and the EU on GI regulations, outlining recommendations on how to best preserve the rights of common name users. CCFN also successfully opposed the recognition of GIs threatening the use of key generic terms. For example, the EU IP Offi ce ruled in October 2020 against a Swiss appeal seeking to register the generic term \"Emmental\" as a trademark. Evidence provided by CCFN helped to support the EU IP Office's determination that it remains a generic term. CCFN's opposition to a trademark application in Turkey for \" Morzarella \" resulted in the Office agreeing to remove dairy from the scope of goods covered by the trademark in June 2021. In addition, CCFN opposed a trademark application submitted by the Consortium for the Protection of the G orgonzola Cheese for the United Arab Emirates, which resulted in the local IP Office denying the registration in June 2021. CCFN developed a trademark logo that can be registered globally to preserve common usage rights with a disclaimer for generic terms. Rights to use the trademark will be extended to generic name users to establish strong protections against bad- faith GI applications. Through FY Q4 2021, the in China. Direct ly-filed national t rademarks and \"CCFN Parmesan\" in Brazil. Plant Variety Protection USDA plant variety protection certificates are recognized worldwide and expedite foreign plant variety protection application filing. The USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)'s Plant Variety Protection Office (PVPO) works act ively with members of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) to promote cooperation on the standards for variety examination. Once plant variety protection is granted, the certificate owners have exclusive legal right s to market and to exclude others from selling their varieties. This legal protection for breeders and inventors promotes the development of new varieties that can increase yield and crop productivity, increase farmer income, and expand trade opportunitie s. Other benefits of plant variety protection include provisional protection upon application receipt, priority when filing in another country, user -friendly filing without the need for an attorney, no annual maintenance fees, and applicant -conducted fiel d trials. FAS encourages free trade agreement partners to become UPOV members to protect U.S. plant breeders' rights across the globe. USDA Plant Variety Protection Activities in FY 2021 PVPO received 500 applications for sexually reproduced, tuber propagated, and asexually reproduced varieties during the fiscal year. Among these were more than 20 applications for asexually reproduced varieties including varieties of almond, anthurium, apple, camellia, he mp, magnolia, mandarin, orchid, phlox, and strawberry. PVPO staff provided four webinars - on the program, the electronic Plant Variety Protection System, and examination procedures - to participants from the European Union Community 9 Plant Variety Office , The International Community of Breeders of Asexually Reproduced Horticultural Plants (CIOPORA), American Seed Trade Association (ASTA), and Seed Innovation and Protection Alliance. The webinars highlighted the benefits of the electronic system, an overview of PVPO examination procedures, and how the addition of asexually reproduced varieties has been implemented. PVPO actively works with ASTA, CIOPORA, and other seed and vegetative industry stakeholders regularly. New members were appointed to the Plant Variety Protection (PVP) Board on September 30, 2020. The Board consists of 14 members representing farmers, the seed industry, trade and professional associations, and public and private institutions involved with developing new plant varieties. Members of the PVP Board provide oversight and guidance to the program on plant variety protection issues. AMS provides intellectual property rights protection through PVPO, which protects breeders of varieties of seed and tuber (potatoes) propagated plants, and a sexually reproduced plants that are new, distinct, uniform, and stable. Authorized by the Plant Variety Protection Act, PVPO examines new variety characteristics to grant certificates that protect varieties for 20 years (25 years for vines and trees). Agricultural Research Service's Protection of USDA's Own Intellectual Property USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has a comprehensive program to protect U.S. Government -owned intellectual property. In addition to IP protection, ARS delivers a comprehensive training program on IP. The program has four components: (1) training scientists on Dual Use Research of Concern, Technology Transfer (TT), and insiders' threats; (2) training TT Staff on U.S. Department of Commerce regulations; (3) Export Control Reviews; and (4) entrance and exit procedures for agency employees to minimize insider threats. 10 D EPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 11 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Department of Commerce Appendix for FY 2021 Annual Report This appendix discusses the FY 2021 activities of the Commerce Department, through the Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP), the International Trade Administration (ITA), the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USP TO). The Commerce Department continues to engage in training and capacity building programs to strengthen intellectual property awareness and enforcement internationally. Additionally, the USPTO provides many different patent , trademark , copyright, and trade secret capacity building programs as fully described in our TRIPS Article 67 report each year, and the following highlights some enforcement activities during FY 2021. COMMERCIAL LAW DEVEL OPMENT PROGRAM The Commerce Department's Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) creates a level playing field for U.S. firms overseas, in particular by building the capacity of foreign countries to improve the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR). As the Office of General Counsel's technical assistance arm, CLDP upholds the Department of Commerce's mission, as stated in its 2018 -2022 strategic plan to \"Accelerate American Leadership.\" Strategic Objective 1.3 is \"Strengthen Intellectual Property Protection,\" and one of the plan's st rategies is to \"strengthen the protection of intellectual property\" abroad. CLDP helps enforce IPR overseas through two types of technical assistance programs: programs that help countries develop an effective IPR enforcement environment, and programs t hat help countries create their own intellectual property, which gives them a vested interest in enforcing IPR. Conducted in close cooperation with the USPTO, other Commerce bureaus, USTR, and other Federal agencies, CLDP's activities typically include consultations, seminars, workshops, and meetings. Starting in March 2020, in light of the public health situation (COVID -19) and of the resulting impossibility to travel overseas, CLDP suspended its traditional activities, most of which took place overseas and conducted, instead, online video- conferences and webinars. At the suggestion of the Director of the USPTO's Global Intellectual Property Acad emy Director, GIPA and CLDP created an \"IP eLearning Community of Practice\" that has been effective in sharing lessons learned by both institutions as they conducted virtual programs. In FY 2021, CLDP IP activities were conducted for the following countries and regions: Afghanistan, Algeria, Armenia, Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Central Asia, Georgia, Middle East/North Africa, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tunisia. As outlined below, CLDP's FY 2021 activities mainly fell into four categories: Judicial Capacity Building in IPR Enforcement; Capacity Building for Institutions that Grant IPR; Capacity 12 Building for Institutions that Enforce IPR; and Development of Innovation Ecosystems, in particular through Technology Transfer. OVERVIEW OF CLDP's FY 2021 IP PROGRAMS 1. Judicial Capacity Building in IPR Enforcement Bosnia and Herzegovina: CLDP Trains Judges on IP Adjudication to Improve the Rule of Law On December 16, 2020, CLDP, along with USPTO and a U.S. federal judge, trained judges from the Centres for Judicial and Prosecutorial Training of the Republika Srpska and Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (B iH) on intellectual property (IP) adjudication. This session, the first in a three -part series, provided an overview of trademark and copyright law and highlighted the importance of IP protection. Training on IP adjudication is part of a larger effort to increase judicial capacity in BiH and strengthen the rule of law with respect to the information and communications technology sector. CLDP Holds Civil Intellectual Property Adjudication Webinar On February 3, 2021, CLDP, in coordination with U.S. Embassy Sarajevo, led a second webinar on intellectual property (IP) adjudication for judges and judicial staff in Bosnia -Herzegovina (BiH). This program is part of CLDP's ongoing effort to support BiH's ability to promote and protect IP rights. CLDP's assistance with judicial capacity building furthers the expansion of democratic institutions and facilitates fair and reciprocal trade and investment. Adjudication of Intellectual Property Infringement Cases: Criminal IP Adjudication On March 10, 2021, CLDP, in partnership with the Centre for Judicial and Prosecutorial Training of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), conducted a one -day webinar which is the third installment in a series entitled Adjudication of Intellectual Property (IP) Infringe ment Cases and focused on criminal IP adjudication. Expert advisors included an Assistant U.S. Attorney from the Department of Justice (DOJ) whose presentation focused on DOJ's expertise in prosecuting computer crime and intellectual property. The main obj ective of the webinar was to foster a dynamic and interactive discussion between stakeholders of the BiH judiciary about the current state of criminal adjudication of IP cases. 2. Capacity Building for Institutions that Grant IPR Afghanistan: Trademark Webinar on Identification and Classification of Proposed Marks On October 6 and 13, 2020, CLDP, in close cooperation with USPTO, conducted a two- part webinar for the Afghan Trademark Directorate (TMD) on trademark (TM ) identification and classification as key elements in the examination of TM applications. This is the continuation of a series of webinar s designed to increase the knowledge and skills of Afghan examiners, 13 enhancing the quality and consistency of operations at the TMD and creating value for both the consumer and seller. CLDP Conducts Trademark Webinar on Registration Renewals On January 26, 2021, CLDP, in collaboration with USPTO, conducted a two- hour webinar on trademark renewal for the TMD . Afghan offici als participated in a discussion citing aspects of Afghan trademark law and raising issues faced by the TMD. The webinar included case studies meant to enhance the thoroughness, accuracy, and efficiency of the TMD in evaluating trademark registration renew al applications to be consistent with global best practices. Trademark Examiners Review of Workshop Series On March 31, 2021, CLDP, in close collaboration with USPTO, conducted a 2- hour webinar for the TMD to review the first eight workshops of the multi -series program on key aspects of trademark examination and registration, including distinctiveness, likelihood of confusion, classification, amendments, and renewals. The review consisted of a question and answer period, including pre -submitted, and ad hoc questions asked by TMD and answered by USPTO experts, as well as a follow -on discussion between and among TMD and USPTO participants. Trademark Examination and Registration of Well -Known Marks On April 22, 2021, CLDP, in close cooperation with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), conducted a 2- hour webinar for the Afghan TMD focusing on the examination and registration of well -known marks. USPTO experts lectured on best practices relat ing to the examination and registration of well -known marks and use d examples and case studies to reinforce the lecture materials. TMD staff were encouraged to ask questions as the lecture continued, including questions arising from TMD's experience in ad dressing issues related to well-known marks. This is the tenth virtual training session of a multi -part series focusing on key concepts and global best practices in the examination and registration of trademarks. CLDP Conducts Webinar on Trademark Disti nctiveness Hearing On May 18, 2021, CLDP, in close cooperation with USPTO, conducted a webinar for the Afghan TMD to observe a hearing before the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeals Board (TTAB) regarding trademark distinctiveness. CLDP prepared the participants with briefs of the issues at appeal and engaged the TTAB Chief Judge in private discussions with the participants to answer questions of law and practice prior to and post -hearing. By exploring the application of the key elements of distinctiveness and how a trademark application can be refused for being merely descriptive, this webinar builds upon the series of CLDP/USPTO webinars focused on critical elements of trademark examination and registration. Georgia: CLDP Leads Webinar Series on Intellectual Property From October 5 to November 3, 2020, CLDP in cooperation with the USPTO and its Global Intellectual Property Academy, conducted a three -part virtual training series for the National Intellectual Property Center of Georgia (Sakpatenti). Topics for the training series included trade secret protection, telework practices and procedures, and overviews of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board and the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. The training series included virtual 14 discussion sessions on each topic as well as related digitally recorded training videos for asynchronous learning. CLDP recorded each training video with Georgian language transcription and created an online video page in Georgian language so that the training materials could be accessed by interested staff members in the future. CLDP Leads Consultation on Collective Management On March 15 -18, 2021, CLDP, in cooperation with the USPTO and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), led a webinar on collective copyright management with the National Intellectual Property Center of Georgia (Sakpatenti) and other IP stakeholders in Georgia . This webinar was designed to help develop solutions, in line with internationally accepted standards and best practices, to maintain an efficient system for fair and transparent collective copyright management in Georgia. Georgia has been a model for collective management in the Caucasus and Central Asian region, but due to recent developments in the collective management field, rightsho lders and users are confused about the Collective Management Organizations (CMO) system and concerned about royalty collection and distribution. As part of this intervention, CLDP arranged for an expert in copyright and collective management to review Geor gia's Law on Collective Management of Copyright and Related Rights and provide a gap analysis to Sakpatenti. CLDP then drafted and delivered to Sakpatenti a Post-Program Report with Recommendations. Both documents will assist Sakpatenti in building suppor t and consensus around the steps needed to strengthen the current system. CLDP is prepared to assist with the organization of follow -up activities in collaboration with Sakpatenti. 3. Capacity Building for Institutions that Enforce IPR Central Asia: CLDP Presents on Socio -Economic Aspects of Trade in Counterfeits On November 17, 2020, CLDP participated in a webinar hosted by the American- Uzbekistan Chamber of Commerce on the prevention of counterfeits for customs officials from the Kyrgyz Republic, Ta jikistan, and Uzbekistan. This webinar aimed to strengthen Central Asian countries' intellectual property (IP) rights, laws, and policies to ensure a more level playing field for IP stakeholders in the region. CLDP Holds Second Meeting of the Central Asi a Expert Level Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) On January 27, 2021, CLDP, in partnership with the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, USTR, and USPTO, hosted a webinar for the Central Asia Regional Expert Level W orking Group on Intellectual Property (IP) Rights concerning interagency coordination for the protection and enforcement of IP rights. The webinar gathered participants from all five Central Asian Republics and discussed processes and best practices for su ccessful interagency coordination in IP enforcement. A set of recommendations were developed and, once finalized, will be sent for country adoption as well as U.S.- Central Asia Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) and C5+1 Platform adoption. CLDP's technical assistance to the Central Asia IP Working Group seeks to strengthen and improve IP protections in order to increase foreign direct investment and trade in the region. 15 CLDP Leads U.S. -Central Asia TIFA Working Groups Session On March 29, 2021, CLDP led the working group session of the U.S.- Central Asia Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) Council meeting. CLDP reported on the work of its Expert Level Working Groups on Customs, Women's Economic Empowerment, Sanitary/Phytosanitary Me asures, and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). The TIFA Working Groups unanimously adopted CLDP's recommended focus areas and projects for the current year, which CLDP developed in coordination with the U.S. Government interagency and with foreign counter parts. Despite recent improvements, two Central Asian countries, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, remain on the U.S. Trade Representative's Special 301 Watch List. By working with the Expert Level Working Group on IPR to implement the TIFA Council's IP -related recommendations, CLDP will help further the Working Group's goal to strengthen intellectual property rights and their enforcement in the region, including through increased coordination nationally and internationally, and thereby to contribute to increase d regional trade and investment. CLDP Holds Third Meeting of the Central Asia Expert Level Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) On July 14- 15, 2021, CLDP virtually gathered government experts from Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan with U.S. -based interagency advisors. The meeting provided a unique platform for interactions among the Central Asian experts and set up a series of meetings to address and overcome deficiencies in intellectual property rig hts (IPR) protections in Central Asia, as noted in the U.S. Trade Representative's Special 301 Report. Aligning IPR protections and enforcement in Central Asia with international best practices will promote innovation and economic diversification and will lead to increased trade and investment in the region. Pakistan: CLDP Conducts Webinar on Combating Counterfeits On February 16, 2021, CLDP, in close cooperation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and USPTO, conducted the second webinar in a series focusing on the prevention of counterfeit medicines and medical devices. The audience was composed of 80 r epresentatives from Pakistan's Federal Bureau of Revenue -Customs (FBR), representing five internal FBR Directorate s (Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement , Model Customs Collectorate, General Intelligence & Investigation, General Audit and Adjudication, Enforcement and Compliance ). This program aims to enhance the skills of FBR officials responsible for enforcing intellectual property rights by stopping the import and export of counterfeit goods at the border, contributing to the protection of the health and safety of the general public. Exchange of Best Practices on Combating Counterfeit Medical Products (Modules 1&2) On March 30 and April 6 & 13, 2021, CLDP, in close cooperation with USPTO, FDA, HSI, and the U.K. Border Force (UKBF), continued the program of exploring best practices to combat counterfeit medicines and medical devices at a count ry's borders. Module 1 was completed over a four -week period beginning February 9 th, and Module 2 consisted of two 2- hour virtual sessions, with one session per week focused on the concerns, experiences, perspectives, interests, and best practices of the pharmaceutical and medical device industry in Pakistan and across the 16 globe. The pr ogram was for Pakistan officials involved in the protection of Pakistan's drug supply from the threat of counterfeits transiting through air freight and air mail facilities in Pakistan. This program was a follow -on to CLDP and USPTO programs with FBR (Cust oms) , IPO and the judiciary regarding customs enforcement and IP -related matters, all of which strengthen Pakistan's IP rights enforcement regime, as well as protecting the public health and safety from dangerous counterfeit products. Exchange of Best Pr actices on Combating Counterfeit Medical Products (Module 3) On July 13 & 27 and August 24 & 31, 2021, CLDP, in close cooperation with USPTO and FDA, continued the multi -series virtual program focused on exploring best practices to combat counterfeit medic al products at a country's borders. Module 3 consisted of four 2- hour virtual sessions focused on the capabilities of USCBP, the UKBF, and FBR (Customs) to halt the scourge of counterfeit products transiting across multiple country borders; highlighted the intelligence collection, targeting, insider threat, and import control capabilities of the UKBF; and emphasized best practices for international/interagency collaboration, including case studies of successful U.S. -U.K. cooperation. 4. Development of Inn ovation Ecosystems/Technology Transfer Algeria: CLDP Conducts Webinar on Academia -to-Industry Technology Transfer On November 18, 2020, CLDP, in collaboration with Algeria's technology transfer agency (ANVREDET), conducted a webinar focused on strategies for effective technology commercialization. The webinar focused on key components of academia -to-industry technology transfer ecosystems, including developing intellectual property policies and creating university technology transfer offices. CLDP's collaboration with ANVREDET is part of CLDP's ongoing effort to promote innovation and entrepreneurship in Algeria, through technology transfer and intellectual property rights. CLDP Conducts Intellectual Property Workshop for University Start -Ups On June 14- 15, 2021, CLDP, in partnership with Algeria's ANVREDET, conducted a virtual workshop for managers of university inc ubators across Algeria. With representatives from U.S. Embassy Algiers and the European Union in attendance, the workshop presented and discussed international best practices for the protection and valuation of intellectual property (IP) assets created at university start -ups. The USPTO IP Attach\u00e9 for the MENA region was the key speaker for the first day of the workshop, focused on IP protection. CLDP was the key speaker for the second day, focused on valuation. The development of technology start -ups has become a priority for the Algerian government, as it seeks to transition to a knowledge -based economy and shift away from reliance on oil and gas. New Technology Transfer Office Created with CLDP Assistance On August 9, 2021, the National Polytechnic School of Algiers (ENP) informed CLDP that ENP had created its first technology transfer office (TTO) as a result of CLDP assistance. For the last five years, CLDP has supported the innovation ecosystem in Algeri a through capacity building technical assistance focused on technology transfer and intellectual property. TTOs are an 17 essential tool for bringing innovation from academic research to market through the protection and licensing of intellectual property. CLDP Co-Organizes, and P resents at Workshop on The Viability of Advanced Technology Start -ups The development of advanced technology start -ups (ATS) is a priority for the Algerian government, as it will be a key condition of the country's transition from a resource- based economy to a knowledge -based economy. The U.S. embassy in Algeria supports this priority because it will contribute to better enforcement of intellectual property rights. In light of the embassy's position, CLDP proposed to join forces with the Algerian Information Technology Association (AITA) to organize a workshop focused on ways to ensure the viability of ATS. The embassy agreed and the Algerian government, at the highest level, embraced this initiative. On October 5- 6, 2021, a workshop focused on The Viability of Algerian Advanced Technology Start -ups took place in Algiers. This workshop - co -organized by CLDP, AITA, and Algerian government institutions - had more than 100 participants, including government officials, managers of techno logy incubators, and members of start -ups. A delegation from the U.S. embassy attended the workshop, with CLDP joining virtually. CLDP gave a presentation on the methodology it has created to assess the viability of ATS; the Algerian government co-organize rs, in a written message, praised this presentation. In coming months, as a follow -up to the workshop, three \"train the trainers\" pilot programs will be launched at the behest of the U.S. embassy to build Algeria's capacity to support ATS. One of these p ilot programs, focused on IP protection strategy, will be conducted by USPTO's IP Attach\u00e9 for the MENA region. Armenia: Videoconference on Technology Transfer On March 23, 2021, CLDP, in coordination with the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan, held a videoconference with a multi -stakeholder group of government officials and private sector leaders to discuss technology transfer capacity and the potential for commercializat ion of intellectual property at universities and research institutions in Armenia. The videoconference highlighted the progress of a group of university and legal professionals in establishing a technology transfer office in Armenia following their partic ipation in CLDP -led technical assistance programs on technology transfer in 2017 and 2018. Technology transfer and commercialization of intellectual property promote innovation and economic development and create opportunities for future research and deve lopment partnerships with American institutions. Bahrain: CLDP Helps Develop Technology License Template for Technology Transfers Over the last year, CLDP, in cooperation with USPTO's IP Attach\u00e9 for the MENA region, helped the Kingdom of Bahrain create the Bahrain Innovation and Technology Center (BITC), now known as the Bahrain Innovation and Technology Transfer Center (BITTC). BITTC is located at the University of Bahrain and serves all nine universities of the Kingdom. BITTC's 18 key mission is to trans fer new technologies developed by universities to the private sector through technology licensing agreements. In December 2020 and January 2021, CLDP collaborated with BITTC to develop a template for technology license agreements. This template addresses k ey risks the Kingdom's universities face in technology transfers and ensures they will derive proper revenues from such transfers. CLDP Creates Country -Specific Invention Disclosure Forms for BITTC On February 17, 2021, CLDP, USPTO, and technology- transf er advisors conducted a video conference call to finalize Bahrain -specific Invention Disclosure Forms (IDFs). Bahrain university professors can use the IDFs to inform BITTC of their inventions. This enables BITTC to seek Intellectual Property (IP) protecti on in the form of patents and support the commercialization of the inventions through licensing. Technology- transfer entrepreneurship will assist the country with diversifying its economy and create investment opportunities for both Bahraini and U.S. businesses. This effort is part of a larger initiative undertaken by CLDP at the request of the U.S. Embassy in Bahrain, to assist the country with the creation of BITTC, IP policy, technology transfer methodologies, and technology licensing templates. CLDP conducts this work in coordination with the USPTO Attach\u00e9 for the MENA region. CLDP and USPTO Train BITTC Staff in IPR On March 15 and 24, 2021, CLDP, in close collaboration with the USPTO, trained BITTC staff on patent filing in the Gulf Cooperation Council. This program is part of a CLDP -USPTO collaboration to conduct over 40 hours of intellectual property rights (IPR) training for BITTC. The program also included training on how to obtain patents and copyrights in the United States as well as other jurisdictions. CLDP Provides Training to Technology Transfer Office On May 18 and 20, 2021, CLDP provided to BITTC staff a two -day training workshop led by U.S. technology transfer academics and professionals. The training workshop focused on the ways to manage technology innovations at university- based technology transfer offices, including how to research patents related to innovation ideas from Bahraini students and faculty. Representatives from George Mason University and Cornell University will provide additional mentoring meetings to BITTC staff during the academic year as questions arise. Effective innovation support from BITTC will allow Bahraini entrepreneurs to protect and commercialize their innovations globally, and potentially partner with U.S. entrepreneurs in the process. CLDP Conducts Simulated Technology Licensing Negotiations for BITTC On June 1, 2021, CLDP conducted a simulated technology licensing negotiation exercise for BITTC's staff. This exercise was based upon a case study created by CLDP, and the former director of Cornell University's technology transfer office engaged in simulated technology licensing negotiations with BITTC's staff. This program developed the capacity of BITTC staff to commercialize patented inventions through technology licensing. CLDP Helps Hone Technology Licensing Negotiations Skills of BITTC Staff On June 16- 17, 2021, CLDP conducted a more complex simulated technology licensing negotiation exercise, with BITTC being now in the position of a potential licensor. This exercise was based upon a case study created by CLDP to simulate technology transfer licensing 19 agreement negotiations in the healthcare industry, thereby further developing BITTC staff's capacity to commercialize inventions through technology licensing. CLDP Conducts Workshop on Technology Licensing to Spin- offs On June 23, 2021, CLDP conducted a workshop for the BITTC that simulated negotiations on the licensing of technology to spin- offs. Spin- offs are start -up companies that commercialize inventions created by university faculty members. Under intellectual property (IP) policies of the Bahraini universities serviced by BITTC, the IP rights of spin- offs belong to the faculty's university. This workshop was based on a case study created by CLDP and a U.S. patent lawyer who negotiates with BITTC. CLDP Conducts Webinar on Material Transfer Agreements On July 14, 2021, CLDP conducted a webinar on Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs) for BITTC. MTAs are contracts that govern the transfer of materials between an organization that possesses rights in the material and an organization tha t plans to use the material for research . MTAs are very important for biological research, and therefore, for subsequent technology transfer. A former director of Cornell University's Technology Transfer program provided the presentation for BITTC staff. T he BITTC assists university professors and students from all nine universities in Bahrain to collaborate with businesses to commercialize technology innovations from Bahrain. CLDP Conducts Mentoring Session for BITTC Staff On July 27, 2021, CLDP conducte d a mentoring session focused on inventiveness analysis for Bahrain's Innovation and Technology Transfer Center (BITTC) staff. Utilizing the expertise of the former director of Cornell University's Technology Transfer Office, these mentoring sessions are d esigned as small group question and answer sessions, complementary to the workshops conducted by CLDP and USPTO's IP Attach\u00e9 for the MENA region. CLDP will host similar sessions once a month with the goal of increasing BITTC's staff effectiveness and assisting start - ups in Bahrain. Middle East/North Africa Regional: Empowering Women Entrepreneurs through Business and Legal Strategies in the Technology Era On March 22 -25, 2021, CLDP, in partnership with Tunisia's National Agency for the Promotion of Research, organized a series of webinars on empowering women entrepreneurs from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and Azerbaijan.

CLDP Continues Engagement with Georgetown Law Center TradeLab On April 30, 2021, Georgetown Law Center's TradeLab Practicum student team gave a presentation to CLDP and interested Georgetown faculty and students on their research, analysis, and recommendations regarding intellectual property (IP) rights enforcement in Pa kistan. CLDP had previously directed the student team to investigate the authorities, composition, resourcing, and effectiveness of Pakistan's special IP tribunals/courts. The student team conducted virtual interviews with lawyers, judges, and businesses operating in Pakistan to gain an on- the-ground perspective of the challenges facing IP rightsholders in Pakistan. To better assess these tribunals/courts, the students conducted comparative research on other special tribunals/courts in six different countries and prepared a matrix of their strengths and weaknesses. This research helped the student team to formulate and recommend improvements to the laws, the tribunals/courts, and to the overall IP rights protection regime in Pakistan. The final written memorandum was presented in mid- May, and CLDP will consider the recommendations of the student team in the development of future programming on IP rights enforcement in Pakistan. Sri Lanka: CLDP Begins a Series of Technology Transfer Webinars On December 2 and 4, 2020, CLDP, in partnership with USPTO, conducted the first two sessions of a multi -phase virtual program on technology transfer in Sri Lanka. CLDP developed this program at the request of the Sri Lanka Ministry of Education as a follow -on to an earlier CLDP program for the senior managers of newly formed university technology transfer offices (TTOs). Experts from the University of Michigan and USPTO presented a variety of subjects including the roles and responsibilities of TTOs, the im pact of the U.S. Bayh- Dole Act, developing and sustaining relationships with the business sector, and the recognition, evaluation, protection, and commercialization of intellectual property (IP) resulting from university research. This program will strengthen the capabilities of the country's TTOs and highlight the key role of IP in creating and sustaining innovation ecosystems that generate economic and societal benefits. 21 Technology Transfer Conference On March 15 -19, 2021, CLDP, in close cooperation with the Sri Lanka Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE), sponsored 21 managers from University Business Linkage offices (UBL cells) to virtually attend the Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM) 2021 Annual Meeting and Conference. ( The AUTM confer ence is discussed above, in the first item for Pakistan.) This program continues to build on programs conducted by CLDP with MoHE and others, to establish and enhance UBL cells at public and private universities across Sri Lanka, all of which play a key role in creating and maintaining an ecosystem of innovation and contribute to the strengthening of Sri Lanka's IP rights enforcement regime. Webinar Series on Technology Transfer On September 28, 2021, CLDP, in cooperation with USPTO, provided a 3 -hour virtual program for university technology transfer offices on the University-Industry relationship, consisting of a 90-minute prerecorded lecture to be followed by a 2- hour live virtual program with experts from the office of Michigan State University (MSU ) Technologies. The prerecorded program was provided in advance to encourage the participants to study the materials, discuss within their university teams, and submit questions for the live/interactive second portion of the program. MSU experts focused on the suite of agreements that define the business relationship and protect the parties (including confidentiality agreements, research agreements, material transfer agreements, and licensing agreements) and explored the critical needs and goals of businesses and universities relating to the commercialization of newly developed intellectual property (IP). A lecture format w as utilized, with learnings reinforced and supplemented by examples, case studies, and exercises. Subsequent webinars will focus in detai l on various subjects critical to the successful commercialization of IP, such as key provisions in licensing agreements, establishing start-ups, and other forms of technology transfer.

INTERNATIONAL TRADE ADMINISTRATION (ITA) Office of Standards & Intellectual Property (OSIP) STOPfakes.gov The Inter national Trade Administration's Office of Standards and Intellectual Property (OSIP) manages the STOPfakes.gov program including resources provided on the STOPfakes website. STOPfakes.gov hosts digital materials which seek to educate and assist businesses, consumers, government officials, and the general public. Industry Specific IP Toolkits These industry sector toolkits focus on IP and provide guidance to U.S. companies seeking to acquire, use and protect copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets in overseas markets. Current industries covered include Sporting Goods, Marine Technology, Pleasure Boats, Medical Devices, Auto Parts, Building Products , and Smart Mobility. IP Snapshots IP Snapshots are one -page documents that provide IP inf ormation about a foreign country. The following information is included on each IP Snapshot: Contact information for local IP Offices, country membership in important IP treaties, the USTR Special 301 Report rankings for the prior three years, and contact information for the IP attach\u00e9 in the region. Seventy- nine (79) IP Snapshots are currently available on STOPfakes.gov. 23 Country IP Toolkits Country Toolkits seek to assist U.S. entrepreneurs with thorough country specific insight focused on IP protections in foreign markets. Available toolkits include China ( updated), Singapore, Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Brunei, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, European Union, Italy, and Peru. IP Highlights These digital resources raise awareness on a range of IP related issues. The inaugural IP Highlight was on Suspicious Solicitations , and it noted how bad actors negatively impact rightsholders by impersonating government agencies. Additionally, the IP Highlights provide information on an array of U.S. Government IP Resources, including the IP Attach\u00e9 Program, the Interior Department's Indian Arts and Crafts Board, Enforcement on Counterfeit Car Seats, and the USPTO's Patent Pro Bono Program. STOPfakes Roadshows The STOPfakes Roadshows deliver critically important information about intellectual property to the audiences that need it most - start -ups, entrepreneurs, small and medium -sized businesses, independent creator s, and inventors. The information is presented by experts from multiple government agencies focused on advancing stakeholders' intellectual property interests : The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office provides information about how to protect patents and trad emarks; The U.S. Copyright Office discusses the importance of copyright protection to creators and businesses; U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) explains how a registered trademark or copyright can be recorded with CBP to facilitate the seizure of infringing goods at our borders; The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or a U.S. Attorney's Office discusses how to protect trade secrets and identify internal and external threats; The U.S. Department of State highlights the role diplomacy and our diplomatic missions play in advocating for U.S. businesses overseas; The International Trade Administration identifies mechanisms for obtaining intellectual property rights protections in export markets; and The Small Business Administration advises on the potential use of grants and loans to help with the costs of obtaining IP protection before exporting. 24 Participating agencies also identify additional resources they make available to assist U.S. businesses with acquiring and protecting their inte llectual property rights. In 2018, the STOPfakes team expanded the opportunities available to businesses at the \"in-person\" roadshows through what are now its three signature offerings: First, participants were able to sign up to talk one -on-one with any of the government agency speakers during 10- minute sessions. Second, participants could apply for online copyright registration . Copyright Office staff offered on -site assistance with the copyright application process. Third, participants were able to apply for copyright and trademark recordation. On- site assistance was made available by Customs and Border Protection staff to navigate the recordation application portal and process. Given the current pandemic, the in- person roadshows have been paused. In F Y 2021, in place of the roadshows, OSIP offered several innovative virtual STOPfakes webinars. STOPfakes Webinars STOPfakes began offering virtual content in August 2020 with eleven webinars taking place between August 25, 2020, and September 30, 2021. F or FY 2021, OSIP continued its virtual STOPfakes webinars with a total of four webinars. These webinars are hosted by STOPfakes and feature some of the same topics and speakers from the roadshow agendas as well as some content from new partners (e.g., NHT SA discusses product safety issues with counterfeit airbags, car seats, replacement parts, etc.). The webinars are being recorded and will be posted on the STOPfakes website and announced via the STOPfakes Twitter feed. The topics covered in STOPfakes Webinars included: IPR and Copyrights with CBP Trademark Basics: What Every Small Business Should Know Now, Not Later with USPTO Patent Basics and USPTO Resources: What Every Small Business Should Know When Developing their Business Plan and Moving Forward Registering Your Trademark Internationally IP Consultations for Businesses and Associations OSIP provided IP business guidance and insight for entities as they sought to expand their opportunities for exporting. Additionally, OSIP participated as a panelist on webinars for associations seeking to provide IP information for their association members. Combatting Trafficking in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods OSIP undertook a critical rol e in the interagency process to develop and implement the January 2020 Report by the Department of Homeland Security on Combating Trafficking in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods . In FY 2021, OSIP continued to meet regularly with industry leaders and 25 provide industry's unique perspective as part of OSIP's support for the ongoing USG activities to combat trafficking in counterfeit and pirated goods. NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION (NTIA) Protect Intellectual Property at ICANN The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), USPTO, and other Federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, continue to engage within the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Number s (ICANN) and the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), highlighting the importance of timely access to domain name registration information (known as WHOIS) for IP rightsholders, to combat infringement online. In response to the European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect during 2018, crucial domain name registration information details are no longer publicly provided. The U.S. Government is playing an active role in the ongoing ICANN policy development process discussions to establ ish a sustainable access and accreditation model as soon as possible, so that IP rightsholders and other legitimate interests can access non -public WHOIS information for enforcement and security purposes. The U.S. Government will continue to work through t he GAC to ensure that intellectual property rights are respected in the ICANN policy development processes. In addition, the review of the new rights protection mechanisms (RPMs), such as the Trademark Clearinghouse, Trademark Claims Service, and the Unif orm Rapid Suspension System, has been completed and awaiting ICANN Board review. The RPMs were created to address intellectual property concerns in response to the introduction of new top- level domains. NTIA, USPTO, IPEC, and other interagency colleagues closely monitored the review of the RPMs and will continue to focus on the effectiveness of these new RPMs. USG also will be closely following the review of the Uniform Domain Name Dispute -Resolution Policy (UDRP), which is expected to begin in 2022. Since its introduction in 1999, the UDRP has been a successful tool in assisting trademark rightsholders to combat cybersquatting. The Section 1201 Rulemaking Throughout NTIA followed rulemaking proceeding under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a)(1)(C), which concluded in October 2021. The rulemaking process allows the Librarian of Congress to determine whether the Librarian shoul d grant any temporary exemptions to the prohibition on circumvention in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a)(1). NTIA worked to fulfill its statutory role to engage in consultation with the U.S. Copyright Office during the rulemaking. NTIA reviewed the proposals and addi tional comments received in the process. At the invitation of the Copyright Office, NTIA also participated in the Office -led public hearings in April 2021 to ask questions to supporters and opponents of the various proposals. NTIA formally share d its vie ws with the Copyright Office through an extensive consultation letter transmitted on October 1, 2021. 26 NTIA appreciates the positive process changes that the Copyright Office has continued to implement in the rulemakings, several of which track closely wit h recommendations NTIA has made both in its previous consultations and in less formal discussions. For example, although necessitated by the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, NTIA found remote participation at the public hearings to be a success, as it allowed f or more inclusive public participation in the process. UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (USPTO) The Director of the USPTO has the responsibility of, among other things, advising \"the President, through the Secretary of Commerce, on national and certain international intellectual property policy issues\" and advising \"Federal departments and agencies on matters of intellectual property policy in the United States and intellectual property protection in other countries.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(b)(8) -(13). Consistent with this responsibility, the USPTO provides expert legal and policy advice to the Administration on issues related to the protection and enforcement of patents, industrial designs, trademarks and geographical indications, copyrights, plant var ieties, and trade secrets, including regulatory test data. The USPTO represents the United States at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and in other international intergovernmental organizations that discuss IP -related matters. In addition, during FY 2021, the Department of Commerce - including the USPTO - provided advice to the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) through extensive input into: the annual Special 301 review of global IP regimes; the Economic and Trade Agreement between the government of the United States of America and the government of the People's Republic of China, including by providing written comments and recommended changes for dozens of implementing measures under Chinese law and participating in technical level calls with Chinese counterparts to discuss implementation obligations; trade agreement negotiations with the government of Kenya and the government of the United Kingdom; and the Notorious Markets Review, as well as the Section 301 inves tigations when intellectual property issues are involved. Additionally, the USPTO participates in the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Intellectual Property Experts Group (IPEG) meetings and advises USTR on IP enforcement -related issues in the context of APEC initiatives. The USPTO provides advice on initiatives, reports, proposed programs, and developments related to IP enforcement made or produced by other APEC economies. The USPTO also organizes and conducts IP enforcement - related programs/seminars for APEC economies. Throughout FY 2021, USPTO's OP IA conducted a state sovereign immunity study in response to an inquiry from Senators Thom Tillis and Patrick Leahy. Specifically, OPIA performed case law research and statistical studies, and submitted its report to Congress on August 31, 2021 (https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USPTO -Report -to-Congress - August2021.pdf ). Strengthen Intellectual Property Enforcement through Internatio nal Organizations The USPTO continues to lead the U.S. delegation to the WIPO Advisory Committee on Enforcement (ACE). ACE provides a multilateral forum for exchanging information and best 27 practices on combatting trademark counterfeiting and copyright pi racy. In September 2021, the USPTO's OPIA participated in and chaired the ACE Online Dialogue, which featured presentations from all WIPO regional groups on New Developments in Combatting Counterfeiting and Piracy on the Internet. The USPTO has also en tered into a number of arrangements with intergovernmental organizations. For example, the USPTO's Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with INTERPOL's Illicit Goods and Global Health Programme has been renewed through 2023. Under the arrangement, the USPTO and INTERPOL intend to cooperate on training and capacity building programs to promote effective intellectual property enforcement internationally. The USPTO also entered into an MOU with the Oceania Customs Organization (OCO), which is composed of 23 nat ional and territorial customs administrations in the Pacific region. The MOU , which runs through September 2023, provides that the OCO and the USPTO intend to cooperate on training and capacity- building programs to promote effective intellectual property enforcement in the region. Promote Enforcement of U.S. Intellectual Property Rights through Trade Policy Tools Throughout FY 2021, the USPTO provided policy advice and technical expertise on domestic and international IP matters to multiple other federal agencies. These included USTR, IPEC, and other bureaus of the Commerce Department. The USPTO also advised USTR on reviews under U.S. trade preference programs such as the Generalized System of Preferences and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA ); Trade Policy Reviews undertaken at the World Trade Organization (WTO); amendments to the South Africa copyright and performers laws; a draft Nigerian copyright bill; the Ukrainian collective management organization (CMO) law and CMO issues; the Indian copyright law; Singapore's copyright law copyright law amendments; Vietnam's IP law amendments; Mexico's new copyright law and its USMCA obligations; and accessions underway at the WTO. In addition, the USPTO assisted USTR in the preparat ion of its annual review of global developments on trade and IP and the Special 301 Report. The Special 301 Report identifies U.S. trading partners in which IP protection and enforcement has deteriorated or remained at inadequate levels and where U.S. persons who rely on IP protection have difficulty with fair and equitable market access. The USPTO assisted in its preparation by providing extensive information on the state of IP protection and enforcement in 70 countries under review. The USPTO likewise provided USTR with information in connection with its compilation of the annual Notorious Markets List, which highlights prominent online and physical marketplaces that reportedly engage in and facilitate substantial copyright piracy and trademark counterf eiting. Support U.S. Small and Medium -Size Enterprises (SMEs) In Foreign Markets The USPTO offers basic - and advanced- topic programming for U.S. Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) doing business abroad through its Global Intellectual Property A cademy (GIPA), a component of the Office of Policy and International Affairs (OPIA). These in -depth programs - organized and conducted by OPIA attorneys - cover best practices in domestic and international IP protection and enforcement and are typically delivered through face -to-face and distance learning modes, both from the USPTO's headquarters in Alexandria, VA, and around 28 the country in cooperation with the USPTO's regional offices and other business units. OPIA collaborates with the USPTO's IP Attach \u00e9s, Regional Offices, other USG agencies, and the Federal Judiciary. In FY 2021, GIPA provided IP awareness and education programming to over 7,740 U.S. SMEs, U.S. government officials, and other U.S. stakeholders. About 22% of GIPA's 248 programs in FY 2021 targeted this domestic audience of IP rights owners, users, and policymakers. During FY 2021, GIPA continued its successful 2020 pivot to all -remote outreach and education delivery, thanks to prior investments in technology platforms and e -learning strategies. During FY2021, the USPTO continued its China IP Road shows , a series of one -day events that delve into the details of how to better protect IP in China. The Roads hows bring to local businesses and stakeholders the expertise and knowledge of the USPTO's China specialists as well as that of special invited guests, who often include local businesspeople and IP experts, thus tailoring the programs to the needs of the specific locales in which they are held. In FY 2021, the USPTO also supported the interagency STOP fakes.gov Initiative, which generally include d organizing and staffing IP Roadshows and webinars throughout the country and maintaining and updating IP Toolkits, including the China IPR Toolkit and a set of IP for SME toolkits for U.S. and UK small -and medium -sized enterprises, which are posted to the USPTO.gov and STOPfakes.gov websites. The USPTO through OPIA/GIPA continued certain domestic training and outreach initiatives, converting previously in- person programming to the virtual environment for several audiences, including IP education programming for U.S. state attorneys general in cooperation with the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG), joint programs with universities and China IP Roadshows and Webinars for U.S. SMEs, a s well as a virtual pilot program on IP for U.S. SMEs doing business in Southeast Asia.

The USPTO supported DOC and whole -of-government efforts to support Women's Economic Empowerment (WEE) through providing IP subject matter expertise to WEE programming. USPTO participated in CLDP and ITA WEE programming, including the ITA's August 2021 virtual event on Women Empowered Leave Legacies Through Trade & Investment (WELLTI) Coffee Chat: Disruptors & Innovators: Women in STEM , which was marketed to women in the U.S. who are in the STEM field interested in doing business in South Africa. Raise Public Awareness of International Intellectual Property Protection and Enforcement The USPTO engages in many outreach activities to raise public awareness of IP. Knowledge is shared through libraries and resource centers, universities, regional offices, face- to-face and distance learning educational programs, and through presence at tra de shows. Additionally, content covering all areas of IP is available on the USPTO's website and promoted through the USPTO's social media platforms. 29 In FY 2021, GIPA continued its decade -long commitment to produce on -demand content through distance -learning modules on the USPTO website. These modules are available in five languages and cover six different areas of IP protection. In addition, self -study materials - including recordings of events, training slide s, and IP toolkits - were updated for asynchronous learning. This on- demand content collectively has drawn nearly 200,000 unique views since their launch in 2010, with the most recent videos covering Patents and Trade Secrets receiving a combined 68,345 views. The USPTO also participates frequently in programs to engage directly with innovators, students, and entrepreneurs. For example, in February 2021, USPTO's OPIA hosted a virtual international forum on the protection of industrial designs, focusing on global trends and developments around the globe. During March 2021, the USPTO conducted its annual Women's Entrepreneurship Symposium through a series of virtual programs; and on August 18- 20, the USPTO conducted the 2021 Invention- Con online.

Although traditional, face -to-face training programs did not take place during FY 2021, the USPTO continued to meet training obligations during this unprecedented time through increasing its leverage of various technologies t o provide live online IP training. GIPA's established capacity for e -learning supported a successful pivot to all -remote delivery of its programs in mid -FY 2020 and continued this delivery in FY 2021. This included developing the technological capability to run virtual international meetings with simultaneous interpretation. Through these well -attended and well -received distance learning initiatives, the USPTO provided tailored content to developed and developing countries and Least Developed Countries ( LDCs). The programs addressed a full range of IP protection and enforcement matters, including enforcement of IP rights at national borders, Internet piracy, IP infringement involving expedited mail deliveries, trade secrets, copyright policy, and patent and trademark examination. Participants included officials with IP -related responsibilities, such as judges, prosecutors, patent and trademark examiners, and IP office administrators. In FY 2021, GIPA conducted 248 IP programs covering all areas of IP. About 78% of these programs targeted foreign officials with IP portfolios, engaging over 9,990 officials from 124 countries and intergovernmental organizations. A complete list of all countries represented at GIPA trainings in FY 2021 is available online at the USPTO Data Visualization Center (https://www.uspto.gov/dashboards/externalaffairs/main.dashxml ). Generally, programs are delivered from GIPA's headquarters in Alexandria, VA, and around the world, through face -to- face and Distance Learning modes. In the interest of further ensuring efficiency and coordination, GIPA also presented programs for U.S. officials and policymakers, providing updates on domestic and IP law and policy. The USPTO's OPIA once again collaborated with the Department of State's Foreign Service Institute (FSI) and Economic Bureau to provide (virtual) IP training for outbound Foreign Service Officers, and to provide subject matter expertise in developing an update to FSI's IP distance learning products. GIPA continues to improve its monitoring and evaluation capabilities, and implemented an updated logic model and multi -part survey in FY 2021. GIPA continued to engage in interagency training coordination meetings with other USG IP training donors such as DOJ, CBP, and DOC's CLDP program, on a whole -of-government basis as well as in smaller, more focused groups. These meetings facilitate discussions around avoiding duplication of efforts to al low agencies with aligned goals to leverage each other's resources to streamline the planning, execution and wrap- up of IP capacity building programs. 31 Other USPTO Activities Related to IP Protection and Enforcement On January 24, 2020, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a report on Combating Trafficking in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods .

DoDI 5000.90: On December 31, 2020, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment published DoDI 5000.90, Cybersecurity for Acquisition Decision Authorities and Program Managers. This issuance establishes policy, assigns responsibilitie s, and prescribes procedures for the management of cybersecurity risk by program decision authorities and program managers (PMs) in the DoD acquisition processes. Over the past decade, the United States' strategic competitors have been able to exploit vul nerabilities in the DoD supply chain by stealing U.S. intellectual property and decreasing confidence in the security of products delivered to the DoD. Contractor facilities \u2014including design, development, and production environments, networks, supply chai ns, and personnel \u2014 can be used by threat actors as cyber pathways to access government program organizations or fielded systems to steal, alter, or destroy system functionality, information, or technology. Program Managers conduct Supply Chain Risk Manage ment (SCRM) to include Cyber -SCRM. This includes conducting market research to assess potential vendors to determine if they: (1) Provide products and components, or sub -components, sourced through original equipment manufacturers or authorized reseller s. (2) Have previously incurred significant malicious network intrusions, data breaches, and loss of client data or intellectual property. (3) Have obtained a Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) level indicating that they practice, at lea st, basic cyber hygiene (e.g., access management, timely patch management, identity management, and password management). The Protecting Critical Technology Task Force: The Secretary of Defense established the Protecting Critical Technology Task Force (P CTTF) in 2018 to protect U.S. critical technologies wherever they reside, regardless of how they are being taken, using every tool and authority at their disposal. During FY 2021, the Task Force integrated the activities of multiple organizations, accel erated the pace, and scaled technology- protection best practices across the Department. It was the Task Force's job to identify and remove roadblocks, shrink timelines for implementation, facilitate senior decision- making, advocate for resources, and drive the Department to better address the technology transfer problem. The Task Force worked across four Lines of Effort (LOEs): (1) Protect the Defense Industrial Base (DIB); (2) Protect the Research and Development Enterprise; (3) Block Malicious Fore ign Investment and Acquisition; and 44 (4) Disrupt and Deny Threat Actors. Within these four LOEs, the Task Force established ten primary objectives: 1. Develop and Operationalize the Critical Programs and Technology (CP&T) List to drive DoD protection (O USD R&E); 2. Increase cybersecurity in the DIB (OUSD A&S); 3. Integrate security into the requirements and acquisitions process (OUSD I&S); 4. Prevent individuals with problematic foreign influence from working on DoD -funded research (OUSD R&E); 5. Counter adversary talent recruitment programs (OUSD R&E); 6. Prevent adversaries from acquiring our critical and emerging technologies through acquisition and investment (OUSD A&S); 7. Expand protection of DoD critical technologies via export controls (OUSD A&S); 8. Undermine adversary confidence in exfiltrated data (OUSD I&S); 9. Operationally respond to cyber threat actors targeting the DIB (OUSD I&S); and 10. Expose Chinese and Russian theft of critical technologies (All). The 2020 DoD CP&T List is the single, authoritati ve Department list for which protection resources should be applied in accordance with law, regulations, and government -wide policies. This CP&T effort is driven from FY 2019 NDAA, Section 1049 - \"The Secretary of Defense shall establish and maintain a li st of acquisition programs, technologies, manufacturing capabilities, and research areas critical for maintaining the national security technological advantage of the United States over foreign countries of special concern.\" The revalidation of the CP&T Li st will continue to be a DoD annual congressional requirement, led by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research & Engineering . As a short duration task force, the PCTTF sunsetted in June 2021. Going forward, the appropriate OSD component(s) assigned to each primary objective listed above will continue to coordinate DoD's efforts for those mission areas and activities. Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC): In accordance with FY 2020 NDAA Section 1648, the Department developed a risk -based cybersecurity framework to enhance the protection of Federal Contract Information and CUI in the DIB sector. In order to implement this framework, the Department published DFARS interim rule 2019- D041, Assessing Contractor Implementation of Cybersecurity Requirements, in the Federal Register at 85 FR 61505, and effective on November 30, 2020. The Department is currently undertaking an 45 internal review regarding CMMC implementation. The drafting team continues to review public comments receiv ed in response to the interim DFARS rule. Defense Acquisition University: The Defense Acquisition University (DAU) engaged in several educational initiatives during FY 2021 that reflect the following themes: (1) the critical role intellectual property plays in maintaining military technological superiority in emerging technologies (e.g., big data analytics, artificial intelligence, autonomy, robotics, directed energy, hypersonics, biotechnology); (2) DoD's desire to assist U.S. Government agencies to identify and build partnerships to address areas of economic, technological, and informational vulnerabilities; and (3) the need to respect and protect technology development investments by both the private sector and U.S. Government from intellectual property theft by both domestic and foreign actors. FY 2021 DAU Educational Initiatives Developed a five -year Strategic Plan for DAU's intellectual property (IP) program, focusing on creating educational resources on IP to maintain U.S. technological superiority and building partnerships with U.S. Government agencies (e.g., IP, trade, enforce ment, intelligence), industry (large and small businesses), academia, associations, and consortia. Established a website (intellectual property Community of Practice) as a one- stop shop for the dissemination of IP training resources, policy and legislati on, best practices, and other resources. Created seven targeted on -demand videos on IP topics important to the acquisition of defense technologies. Reviewed DAU online IP modules for a comprehensive revamp focused on scenario exercises, interactive tool s and interfaces, and enhanced graphics. Conducted live and virtual workshops with DoD and industry representatives on key IP topics (e.g., pricing/IP valuation and evaluation) and IP workshops for engineering staff. Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) The Naval Criminal Investigative Service Safeguards Department of the Navy (DON) acquisition programs and protects the DON's capital investments in technology by conducting investigations and operations that reduce product substitution, combat corruption, and disrupt foreign exploitation of DON acquisition. Reducing product substitution remains a top priority for NCIS to ensure the DON procures products that meet safety standards for the warfighter, thereby enhancing operational readiness and le thality. 46 As competitors of the United States continue to modernize their militaries, the advantage of early detection of counterfeit goods has become increasingly clear. Early detection mitigates degraded platform capabilities and improves battlefield rel iability and superiority. To proactively combat the threat posed by counterfeit goods, NCIS is a partner in Operation Chain Reaction, which is led by the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center and targets counterfeit goods entering the s upply chains of the Department of Defense and other U.S. Government agencies. Through extensive partnerships, NCIS has successfully reduced this threat to the warfighter. Additionally, a joint investigation involving NCIS led to the indictment of a defens e contractor in 2020 for selling Chinese -made body armor and other related goods to Federal agencies, including the DON. The investigation determined that the contractor falsely certified that the ballistic vests, helmets, riot gear, and other items he off ered for sale were manufactured in Hong Kong and the United States when, in fact, they were manufactured in China, in violation of U.S. law. NCIS participated in the joint investigation with the GSA Office of Inspector General; the State Department Office of Inspector General; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; the Army Major Procurement Fraud Unit; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service; HSI; the FBI; the Air Force Office of Special Investigations; the Coast Guard Investigative S ervice; and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland. The DOJ press release is at https://www.justice.gov/usao 47 D EPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 48 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Appendix for FY 2021 Annual Report This appendix discusses the FY 2021 activities of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . Drug counterfeiting and adulteration are serious threats to public health. Counterfeit or unapproved drugs raise significant public health concerns because their safety and effectiveness are unknown. In the United States, a relatively comprehensive system of laws, regulations, and enforcement by Federal and state authorities have helped reduce drug counterfeiting incidents, and FDA works to ensure that Americans can have a high degree of confidence in the approved drugs that they obtain through legal channels. FDA has made it a priority to investigate reports of counterfeit and unapproved drugs and works with U.S. drug supply chain stakeholders to improve our ability to prevent, detect, and respond to threats of counterfeit , unapproved, and substandard drugs. FDA also educates consumers and the health care community about the risks of, and minimizing exposure to, counterfeit , unapproved, and substandard drug products through oversight of voluntary recalls, public awareness campaigns, and other steps. Additionally, FDA reaches beyond U.S. borders and works with our foreign counterparts to identify global supply chain vulnerabilities as well as identif y and implement realistic solutions, nationally and internationally. Improving the Security of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Drug Traceability FDA continues to implement provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of the Drug Quality and Security Act) that was enacted on November 27, 2013. The DSCSA helps to improve the integrity and security of the pharmaceutical distribu tion supply chain for most prescription drugs by establishing product tracing, product identifier, authorized trading partner, and verification requirements for manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers . The DSCSA also requir es critical steps to build an electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace such prescription drugs that are distributed in the United States by 2023, in addition to development of national standards for licensure of wholesale distributors and third -party logistics providers. Among other actions to help secure the supply chain, the DSCSA is intended to facilitate the exchange of information to verify product legitimacy, enhance detection and notification of an illegitimate product, and facilitate produ ct recalls. In FY 2021, FDA issued several key guidance documents for industry. In October 2020, FDA issued compliance policies to minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the U .S. because some wholesale distribut ors expressed a need for additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin verifying returned products prior to resale or other further distribution in an efficient, secure, and timely manner. Also, some dispensers (primarily pharmacies) also needed additional time to perform certain verification activities in investigating suspect product or when responding to a notification of illegitimate product from FDA or another trading partner. Under these compliance policies, FDA does not 49 intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against wholesale distributors or dispensers who do not comply with these verification requirements. Trading partners can use the additional time to ensure the systems and processes that are put into place m eet the enhanced system requirements by November 27, 2023. In June 2021, FDA finalized two guidance documents and published two draft guidance documents regarding DSCSA requirements that prescription drugs be identified and traced properly as they move th rough the supply chain. These guidance documents lay out the FDA's recommendations for how to comply with applicable DSCSA requirements, including those for enhanced drug distribution security at the package level that go into effect in November 2023. The guidance documents are summarized below: The final guidance on Product Identifiers Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, Questions and Answers addresses the DSCSA requirement that manufacturers and repackagers affix a product identifier on drug packa ges. This includes the product's national drug code (NDC), serial number, lot number and expiration date on each package and homogenous case of product, in human- and machine -readable form. The machine -readable form is generally a two -dimensional data mat rix barcode. Possible industry questions are clarified in the final guidance. The final guidance on Drug Supply Chain Security Act Implementation: Identification of Suspect Product and Notification is intended to aid certain trading partners in identifying a suspect product and specific scenarios that could significantly increase the risk of a suspect product entering the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. The guidance document also describes how trading partners should notify the FDA of illegiti mate product and sets forth a process for terminating notifications of illegitimate product in consultation with the FDA. In addition, this guidance document responds to comments from stakeholders to clarify certain points and finalizes the remaining draf t portion, i.e., describing when manufacturers should notify the FDA of a high risk that a product is illegitimate, of the otherwise final guidance issued in December 2016. When finalized, the revised draft guidance on Definitions of Suspect Product and Illegitimate Product for Verification Obligation under DSCSA will lay out the FDA's thoughts on terms used to define \"suspect\" and \"illegitimate\" products, to help trading partners determine when to report an illegitimate product to FDA under the DSCSA's verification requirements. These terms include \"counterfeit,\" \"diverted,\" \"stolen,\" \"fraudulent transaction,\" and \"unfit for distribution.\" In response to comments received from stakeholders, this draft guidance revises the March 2018 draft guidance. The draft guidance on Enhanced Drug Distribution Security at the Package Level under DSCSA is intended to assist supply chain stakeholders, particularly trading partners, with requirements for enhanced drug distribution security at the package level that go into effect on November 27, 2023. When finalized, this guidance will provide recommendations on the system attributes necessary for enabling the secure tracing of product and verification at the package level. 50 FDA is planning for additional stakeholder engagement and discussions on systems and processes needed for enhanced supply chain security requirements that go into effect in 2023. For updates about DSCSA implementation and copies of the guidance documents see http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugIntegrityandSupplyChainSecurity/DrugSupplyChain SecurityAct/default.htm . Engagement with Other Countries Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Global Medical Product Quality and Supply Chain Security Efforts FDA is the global lead for the APEC Supply Chain Security Toolkit, which is a comprehensive resource that addresses prevention, detection, and response with regards to vulnerabilities in the medical product supply chain. It covers the entire supply chain and life cycle of medical products. The toolkit is the culmination of a collaborative project that was commissioned by APEC with the oversight of the Life Sciences Innovation Forum (LSIF) and the Regulatory Harmonisation Steering Committee. In February 2021, FDA presented the toolkit to the Subcommittee on Customs Procedures (SCCP) and the LSIF meetings at the First Senior Officials' Meetings (SOM1) which were led and hosted by New Zealand's Ministry of Health. Additionally, this Priority Work Area (PWA) Champion is currently updating the supply chain toolkit particularly on internal sales and post - marketing surveillance due to the feedback from pharmaceutical industry, member states regulators, United States Pharmacopeia (USP), and World Health Organizat ion (WHO). Furthermore, APEC endorsed a new Center of Excellence (COE) for Taylor's University of Malaysia in January of 2020 that collaborated with USP in co- hosting several workshops for which FDA gave guidance as the PWA lead. As part of this effort, in March 2021, FDA participated virtually in a meeting convened by the USP and Taylor's University COE for Global Supply Chain Integrity in collaboration with the APEC LSIF and Ministry of Health Malaysia. This included a series of webinars culminating in a two -day training session on global supply chain integrity. The onset of the COVID -19 pandemic and the arrival of COVID -19 vaccines highlight the importance of fortifying vulnerable medical supply chains with a proper understanding of traceability and distribution of medical products. FDA presented on topics including good distribution practices and track- and-trace, and highlighted the utility of the toolkit in preventing, detecting, and responding to breaches in the medical produc t supply chain. WHO Member State Mechanism FDA is highly involved in the technical, policy, and strategic implementation of the World Health Organization Member State Mechanism on Substandard and Falsified Medical Products (WHO MECH) and serves as a vi ce-chair for the America's region on its Steering Committee. FDA supports the WHO MECH in its global efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to substandard and falsified (SF) medical products, including the development of reports, guidance, tools, and oth er products. The WHO MECH, composed of public health and national 51 medicines regulatory authorities, focuses on the public health aspects of SF medical products, and does not address intellectual property rights issues. Global Surveillance and Monitoring System FDA has supported the World Health Organization (WHO) to establish the Global Surveillance and Monitoring System (GSMS) for Substandard and Falsified Medical Products which was launched in 2013. The GSMS provides national medicines regulatory authorities (NMRAs) with an information portal to report counterfeit medical products, and the ability to check if similar products have been found around the globe. If similar products have been found, the WHO works with NMRAs to investigate suspected counter feit cases and issue alerts as necessary. The GSMS portal is available in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. The online portal, search facility, and access to the photo library have also enhanced participation by Member States. Manufacturers can also submit information on counterfeit products to the GSMS. The WHO has reported that the quality and number of reports to GSMS has been steadily increasing in the last few years. Illegal Opioids and Other Consumer Education Illegal Opioids Online and Warning Letters Issued Opioid addiction is an immense public health crisis and addressing it is one of FDA's highest priorities. Tragically, more than 100,000 Americans have died from drug overdoses in the 12 months leading up to April 2021, representing a 28% increase over the same period last year.3 The illegal online marketing of unapproved opioids is particularly concerning in light of the nation's opioid addiction and overdose epidemic . In addition, opioids bought online may be counterfeit and could co ntain other dangerous substances. During FY 2021, FDA issued four warning letters to the owner(s)/operator(s) of internet pharmacy websites illegally offering for sale unapproved and misbranded opioids to U.S. consumers. Unproven products that claim to treat or prevent COVID -19 and other conditions As part of its response to the public health emergency, FDA has also addressed the increase in unproven products sold with fraudulent COVID -19 claims and has issued more than 180 warni ng letters to . In addition, since the start of the COVID- 19 pandemic, FDA has issued 17 warning letters to owners and/or operators of internet pharmacy websites that illegally offer for sale unapproved and misbranded drugs purported to treat COVID -19 to U.S. consumers. See https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug -supply- chain -integrity/internet- pharmacy -warning- letters . FDA issued 84 health fraud public 3 FACT SHEET: The Biden Administration Launches New Efforts to Counter Transnational Criminal Organizations and Illicit Drugs, December 15, 2021 available at : . The FDA's Ope ration Quack Hack leveraged agency expertise and advanced analytics to protect consumers from fraudulent medical products during the COVID -19 pandemic. Building upon our previous experience with illegal online pharmacies, a team of consumer safety officers, special agents, and intelligence analysts triage incoming complaints about fraudulent and unproven medical products. Where appropriate, complaints ar e sent to other agencies or to FDA centers for additional review and possible follow -up action. In some cases, following a preliminary investigation, the Operation Quack Hack team sends an abuse complaint to the domain name registrars or a report to onlin e marketplaces. As of September 30, 2021, FDA issued more than 600 abuse complaints and reports, which are intended to notify companies that may not have been aware that their platforms were being used to sell an unapproved, unauthorized, or uncleared medical product during the COVID -19 pandemic. Through Operation Quack Hack, online marketplaces and registrars have been notified by the FDA of more than 2,100 fraudulent COVID -19 related product listings and websites. Please see FDA's website for more information regarding Operation Quack Hack. On December 27, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the Distr ict of New Jersey entered a consent decree of permanent injunction that prohibits a New Jersey -based company from receiving or distributing any drugs until the company complies with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and other requirements . The complaint, filed by the Department of Justice on behalf of the FDA, alleged that Natural Solutions Foundation, an organization, and its two principals, Rima Laibow and Ralph Fucetola, violated the FD&C Act by selling unapproved and misbranded drugs intended to cure, mitigate, treat or prevent COVID -19. The defendants had received a jointly issued warning letter from FDA and FTC on May 19, 2020. FDA Warns Consumers to Avoid Certain Male Enhancement and Weight Loss Products Sold Through Amazon, eBay , and Other Retailers In December 2020, FDA warned consumers not to use nearly 50 sexual enhancement or weight loss products that have been found to contain hidden ingredients and may pose a significant health risk. FDA purchased 51 products from Amazon and eBay for testing, and 46 of the products tested were found to contain undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients. The FDA's laboratory testing found the products contained various undeclared active ingredients, including sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, sibutramine, desmethylsibutramine, phenolphthalein and/or fluoxetine. Many of these are active pharmaceutical ingredients for use in FDA -approved prescription drugs, which are restricted to use under the supervision of a licensed health care professional. Twenty -eight of these products have been voluntarily recalled during FY 2021. FDA Warns Five Companies Illegally Selling Dietary Supplements Claiming to Treat Infertility On May 26, 2021, FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) jointly issued warning letters to five companies for illegally selling dietary supplements that claim to cure, treat, mitigate, or prevent infertility and other reproductive health disorders in vi olation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). These companies were selling and marketing their products 53 with unproven claims online and through their social media accounts. See Opioid Summit On September 9, 2021, FDA virtually hosted its third summit to continue to enhance collaboration to maximize the scope of our efforts to address the illegal availability of opioids online. The focus of the summit was enhancing collaboration with internet stakeholders, government entities, academia, and other important partners. Discussions at the summit highlighted successes since previous summits and discussed new ways to continue to combat the online component of the opioid crisis. Enforcement Actions The FDA Office of Criminal Investigation's Cybercrime Investigations Unit (CcIU) continues to target darknet marketplaces and vendors that manufacture and sell counterfeit opioids, by identifying those responsible, arresting perpetr ators, and seizing manufacturing equipment, counterfeit drugs, and assets. Thus far, CcIU's Operation CyberPharma has led to the arrest of 46 darknet vendors and aided in the takedown of a major darknet marketplace as well as the seizure of drug counterfe iting tools, counterfeit drugs, and over $6.9 million in virtual currencies and other assets. CcIU agents also monitor the surface web to identify sellers of counterfeit FDA- regulated products. Cybercrime agents can swiftly make test purchases from onlin e merchants selling consumer goods suspected to be counterfeit or substandard. In response to the COVID- 19 pandemic, CcIU agents have participated in Operation Quack Hack, an FDA -wide initiative targeting counterfeit or substandard CO VID-19 related products. Since its inception in March 2020, this operation has resulted in the removal of approximately 2,100 fraudulent or unproven products by domain name registrars and marketplaces. Cybercrime agents have used this operation in support of a number of COVID -related criminal cases, including the identification of counterfeit masks and the closure of a website claiming to sell the Moderna COVID- 19 vaccine. Pilot Process to Reduce the Availability of Opioids Online Launched In June 2020, FDA and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) partnered to announce the launch of a 120- day pilot to help reduce the availability of unapproved opioids illegally offered for sale online. Under the pilot, the FDA notified participating internet registries - Registry Services (formerly Neustar), Verisign, and Public Interest Registry - when the agency sent a warning letter to a website operator and the website operator did not respond adequately within the required timeframe. The internet registries reviewed the FDA's notifications and assessed whether to take further voluntary action, including possible domain name suspensions or blocks. As a result of the pilot, nearly 30 websites illegally offering opioids for sale became inaccessible to the public. 4 4 FDA In Brief: FDA Continues Efforts to Curb Illegal Availability of Unapproved Opioids Online , for Drug Evaluation and Research's ongoing BeSafeRx: Know Your Online Pharmacy campaign raises awareness about the dangers of buying prescription medicine from illegally -operating online pharmacies. Th is campaign helps consumers understand the risks, identify the signs of an unsafe online pharmacy, and identify the signs of a safe online pharmacy. During FY 2021, the BeSafeRx campaign received 2,039,602 airings/placements, yielding an estimated 294.74 million impressions across TV, radio and waiting rooms. This includes the BeSafeRx TV public service announcements (PSAs) w hich aired 21,471 times on 194 television stations and 10 television networks across the country, yielding approximately 113.27 million impressions. The BeSafeRx radio PSAs aired 53,229 times on 940 radio stations (unique stations including Nielsen, non -Nielsen, and Total Traffic & Weather Network affiliates), 13 networks (including TTWN) and 1 program, yielding approximately 167 million impressions. The BeSafeRx video PSAs also aired 1,964,902 times in the waiting rooms of physician offices and hospital s across the country, yielding 14.47 million impressions. Outreach to Health Care Providers FDA provides various online courses to inform healthcare professionals and provide them continuing education opportunities. One of these courses, Tainted Products Marketed as Dietary Supplements , is available for access through the FDA website. The course focuses on the prevalence of adulterated and misbranded products masquerading as dietary supplements sold in convenience stores, retail establishments, and online . These products continue to be the source of adverse event reports submitted to the agency. The webinar outlines how healthcare professionals can help protect consumers and patients from these products, how adverse events can be reported to FDA, and wha t measures FDA is taking to protect consumers and patients. Using Advanced Technology to Identify Suspect Products: CDx (handheld Counterfeit Detection devices) FDA scientists developed a handheld Counterfeit Detection (CDx) device intended to be used to rapidly screen suspect products and packaging, by visualizing differences between suspect and authentic products and providing preliminary findings in the field. The current CDx technology is used at the U.S. International Mail Facilities (IMFs) to screen incoming packages to assess finished dosage form pharmaceuticals that are offered for entry. The goal is to put affordable tools for identifying counterfeit FDA -regulated products, including pharmaceuticals, in the hands of global regulatory law enforcement, and public health officials. availability -unapproved- opioi ds-online . Please note the pilot was directed to websites offering misbranded and/or unapproved opioids for sale to U.S. consumers and did not specifically address counterfeits. 55 An updated device prototype, CD5, is currently being evaluated for field- screening suspected counterfeit pharmaceuticals, and intelligent sampling of products for further examination and confirmation/analysis. Information gathered during a pilot study will be used to finalize the device production units and to refine the training program and materials to support their use. In FY 2021, 66 examinations were conducted by import investigators using the CDx devices. The 66 products examined with the CD5 represented over 9,400 individual finished dosage form pharmaceuticals from four IMFs. 29 of the 66 different products were sent to the Forensic Chemistry Center for confirmation and/or analysis. Scientific presence and field deployable tools for rapid field detection of illegal, unapproved, and counterfeit pharmaceuticals and tainted supplements In October 2020, FDA, with DHS/ CBP and DHS/ICE Commissioners formalized a partnership at International Mail Facilities (IMF) in a Memorandum of Understanding. This agreement increases collaboration to maximize inspection and detection capabilities in order to prevent illegal and harmful products entering the U.S. through the nation's IMFs and Ports of Entry. This partnership includes an increase in scientific resources at selected IMFs and sharing of space, technologies and information, which will facilitate mission responsibilities by improving efficien cy and reducing duplication of efforts. FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) identified specially trained field -based scientists using an established a set of tools to be the most scientifically reliable and efficient approach for the rapid identifica tion of illicit FDA -regulated products (such as counterfeit drugs , including opioids, and adulterated \"supplements\"). ORA expanded collaborative efforts with Federal partners in the fight against illegal/unapproved drugs by establishing satellite laborato ry presence at the Chicago O'Hare IMF in partnership with CBP's Laboratories and Scientific Services (LSS) and by continuing method development work on detection of pharmaceutical based agents. Additionally, in 2021 ORS and OEIO provided training and depl oyed a handheld Raman device, which can be used to identify illegal/unapproved drugs at ports of entry. While COVID interrupted IMF lab operations in 2020, i n May 2021 FDA's Forensic Chemistry Center trained additional scientists and resumed full operations at the Chicago IMF. FDA's plans continue to move forward to have additional IMF satellite laboratories operational in FY 2022. Collaboration with CBP at international mail facilities (IMFs) As part of FDA's Import Operation Strategy, FDA import operations personnel work daily with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel at IMFs and ports of entry. FDA regulatory investigators determine admissibility of FDA -regulated products. All parcels reviewed that contain pharmaceuticals, regardl ess of detention status, are documented and processed by FDA. On a daily basis, FDA generates data at seven IMFs regarding the detention of unapproved drugs, suspected counterfeit pharmaceuticals, products marketed as foods and/or dietary supplements cont aining undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients, and other non- compliant FDA -regulated products. This data is routinely shared within FDA and CBP. 56 FDA also shares technology with CBP. For example, FDA and CBP personnel collaborate to utilize FDA's handheld CDx (discussed above) to identify counterfeit pharmaceuticals. FDA's Office of Enforcement and Import Operations in cooperation with the Office of Regulatory Science is looking at extending the CDx in conjunction with other handheld technologies to identify additional potential counterfeit pharmaceuticals and FDA -regulated products containing undeclared APIs. For example, the first training sessions for OEIO field staff and OCI on the Progeny ResQ, a handheld Raman device, were held in May 2021, with advanced training planned for FY 2022. The Progeny is also used by IMF satellite lab chemists to complement the CDx for identification of counterfeit pharmaceuticals. The Progeny can identify potentially misbranded and adulterated drug products, assist investigators/inspectors in making sampling decisions, and add a margin of safety for inspectors by permitting some identifications to be accomplished o n intact containers. International Capacity Building and Training: FDA Capacity Building and Training Below are examples of FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) capacity building and training activities with foreign countries. In October 2020, OC I participated in the virtual 27th Meeting of the Heads of Medicines Agencies Working Group of Enforcement Officers (WGEO). WGEO was established in 2007 by the Heads of Medicine Agency to contribute to the protection of human and animal health welfare. In October 2020, OCI participated in the Indo- Pacific Regional Webinar Series on Enforcement against Trade in Counterfeit Goods. The session on Overview of Laws against IP Infringement and Challenges for Consumers and Rightsholders in the Global and Onlin e Environment was hosted by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). In November 2020, OCI participated in the Indo- Pacific Regional Webinar Series on Enforcement against Trade in Counterfeit Goods. The session on Transnational Enforcement Operations: How Law Enforcement and Public Prosecutors Can Work with the Private Sector was hosted by DOJ and USPTO. In December 2020, OCI conducted a liaison and outreach meeting with representatives from the United Kingdom's N ational Crime Agency, Border Force, and Her Majesty's Revenue, together with CBP and Homeland Security Investigations, to discuss information sharing on U.S./U.K. criminal investigative leads involving unapproved/counterfeit COVID -19 Vaccines. In Januar y 2021, OCI participated, via teleconference, in a training workshop with Bayer AG on Crime Defense Meeting that focused on combatting transitional crime involving FDA regulated products and the associated public health risk. In February 2021, OCI, and FD A's Europe Office met with the European Union's (EU) executive body, known as the European Commission (EC). The focus of the initial meeting was to make the EC aware of issues FDA faces regarding the EU's Falsified Medicines Directive and 57 the issue of non- FDA approved products being shipped to the United States from and through the EU. Further meetings and dialogue are anticipated. In February 2021, the OCI liaison to Europol initiated meetings with the Universal Postal Union (UPU) located in Berne, Switzerland. These meetings, in conjunction with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, have focused on steps that can be taken to enhance the effectiveness of the prohibited- items list as it relates to small mail parcels containing violative FDA regulated products being shipped to the United States. In March 2021, OCI participated, via teleconference, in the 9th Annual Pharma Anti - Counter feiting & Serialisation 2021 regarding counterfeit medical products in light of the COVID- 19 pandemic. In March 2021, OCI participated, via teleconference, in the Anglophone Pharmacrime Working Group with DOJ and discussed a case study on Investigating Large Criminal Networks . The participants analyzed investigative and prosecutive techniques from an FDA perspective. In March 2021, OCI participated, via teleconference, in an annual workshop hosted by the Organization for Economic Co- Operation and Development's Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade. The workshop was on Countering Illicit Trade for Strong Recovery . In March 2021, OCI liaison to Europol attended the virtual \"kick- off\" meeting for Operation Shield II. Operation Shield is funded by the EU's Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) and coordinated by Europol. This year's operation will focus on a variety of medical products and will be led by several European countries. It is also supported by the EU's European Anti -Fraud agency (OLAF). In May 2021, OCI participated, via teleconference, in a workshop held by the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization, on Combating Counterfeit Food and Beverages . In May 2021, OCI participated, via teleconference, in a workshop hosted by DO J for Bulgarian Customs. The participants analyzed investigative and prosecutive techniques from an FDA perspective. In May 2021, OCI participated, via teleconference, in a workshop hosted by DOJ for the Africa Joint Pharmacrime Working Group. The part icipants analyzed investigative and prosecutive techniques from an FDA perspective. In May 2021, OCI participated, via teleconference, in a workshop with the U.K.'s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the National Food Crime Uni t (NFCU) on Basic online undercover purchases . The training introduced MHRA and NFCU to OCI's investigative experience in handling illicit online pharmacy investigations, and incorporated threat assessments and evaluations involving emerging drug supply chain issues, public health threats, and the i nfrastructure that supports this type of criminal activity. 58 In May 2021, OCI participated, via teleconference, in a workshop hosted by USPTO on Combatting the Distribution and Sale of Counterfeit Medicines and Vaccinations for officials from Mexico, Guat emala, Honduras, and El Salvador. In June 2021, OCI participated, via teleconference, in a workshop hosted by USPTO on Intellectual Property and Health for Mexican prosecutors and law students. In August 2021, OCI successfully completed a six- month virtual training workshop for a broad range of officials from Pakistan Customs Service (PCS). The workshop, which was co- hosted with the USPTO and the Commerce Department's Commercial Law Development Program, enhanced the capacity of PCS to help protect drug supply chain from the threat of counterfeits and identify trends and patterns of transnational criminal organizations exploiting trade routes. The program continued to build and strengthen the relationship between and among the participants, including the u se of an interagency approach for addressing intellectual property rights, collaborating on enforcement issues, and protecting public health and safety. Laboratory/Analytical Capacity Building through International Collaboration The International Laborat ory Forum on Counterfeit Medicines (ILFCM) is comprised of scientific experts from National Regulatory Control Laboratories. It began in 1999 with a bilateral arrangement between FDA and the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Age ncy (MHRA), and it developed into a partnership with global regulatory counterparts from Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia to maximize the benefits of a scientific network and exchange information on emerging issues related to counterfeit and ille gal medicines. The ILFCM also focuses on issues related to falsified/substandard medicines, adulterated dietary supplements, and other important public health topics. The ILFCM is closely aligned with the Permanent Forum on International Pharmaceutical Crime (PFIPC) and provides scientific guidance and laboratory support. The 2020 and 2021 annual PFIPC/ILFCM meeting s were cancelled due to the COVID -19 global pandemic. At this time no decision has been made on the 2022 meeting. Enforcement Activities OCI's Cybercrime Investigation Unit (CcIU) OCI's internet- related criminal investigations are led by its Cybercrime Investigations Unit (CcIU), which strategically targets online transnational criminal networks that threaten the public health of Americans. In FY 2021, CcIU focused resources to counter public health threats, such as the COVID- 19 pandemic and the opioid crisis, through enforcement operations such as Operation Quack Hack and Operation Cyber Pharma (described above). CcIU also participates in the Permanent Forum on International Pharmaceutical Crime (PFIPC), the Public Safety Working Group of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), and several cybercrime -related international law enforcement working groups. 59 OCI's International Operations Program OCI's International Operations Program (IOP) assists in detecting violative shipments of FDA - regulated products entering our domestic ports and facilities. It is led by two Senior Operations Managers and consists of 16 full -time and one part -time IOP speci al agents and supported by two intelligence research specialists. IOP's priorities include responding to U.S. Postal Service International Mail Facilities (IMFs), express consignment carrier facilities (including integrators such as DHL, UPS, and FedEx), air cargo facilities, and sea and land ports. IOP special agents routinely conduct joint enforcement activities, including internationally, and play a critical role as part of the FDA's support to the U.S. government -wide effort to combat cross -border cri me. IOP frequently provides training to its foreign law enforcement counterparts. In FY 2021, IOP successfully completed a six -month virtual bilateral training workshop and joint exercise for the Pakistan Customs Service, together with the Commerce Department's Commercial Law Development Program and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The focus of this workshop was to help identify, interdict, and seize contraband transiting through air freight and air mail facilities in Pakistan that poses a signific ant health and safety risk for the public in the United States, Pakistan, and elsewhere. IOP also provides training to federal partner agencies, State and local law enforcement personnel, and regulated industry. OCI Enforcement Actions OCI plays a leadi ng role in combating counterfeit pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Below are notable examples of OCI's enforcement activities. Additional FDA enforcement cases are discussed further below. Review of Certain Imported Drugs FDA has implemented the enfo rcement tool provided by section 708 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) to combat illegal drug importation. Section 708 amended section 801(a) of the FD&C Act to give FDA the authority to administratively destroy refuse d drugs that are valued at $2500 or less. This authority was implemented nationwide in FY 2017. In addition, in the SUPPORT Act (Substance Use -Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act), which becam e law on October 24, 2018, Congress granted FDA additional imports authorities to help the Agency advance efforts to stop illegal and unsafe drugs from being imported into the United States. For instance, section 3022(d) of the SUPPORT Act added section 801(u) to the FD&C Act; the provision authorizes FDA to treat certain imported articles as \"drugs\" for purposes of determining admissibility, including if the article is an ingredient \"that presents significant public health concern\" and it is, or contains, the same active pharmaceutical ingredient of an FDA approved drug. This provision enhances FDA's ability under its importation authorities in section 801 of the Act to detain, refuse and/or destroy illicit articles imported in the IMFs. 60 FDA developed pr ocedures for the section 801(u) authority and began using this new authority on March 4, 2019. In FY 2020, FDA destroyed over 34,000 violative drug products that were not in compliance with U.S. requirements. More than 22,000 (65%) of those violative drug products were destroyed based on the new authority under section 801(u). In FY 2021, FDA has destroyed over 59,000 violative drug products with more than 43,000 (73.7%) utilizing this authority. The Safeguarding Therapeutics Act In the Safeguarding Therapeutics Act (Pub. L. 116- 304), signed into law on January 5, 2021, Congress amended section 801(a) of the FD&C Act to grant FDA the authority to administratively destroy medical devices valued at $2500 or less (or such higher amount as the Secretary of the Treasury may set by regulation) that have been refused admission into the United States. FDA is in the process of implementing this new destruction authority with development of the associated regulation . Operation Opson FDA cont inues to participate in the annual Operation Opson , which is a joint operation lead by Europol and INTERPOL that targets counterfeit and substandard food and beverages. Operation Opson began in 2010 and has grown to include over 60 participating countries .

As outlined below, DHS's activities including protecting public and private acquisition supply chains from counterfeits; conducting law enforcement operations; engaging with stakeholders; educating the public; cooperating with foreign law enforcement; enhancing IP enforcement through international organizations; and providing capacity building and training to support IP enforcement in other countries . Protecting Public and Private Acquisition Supply Chains from Counterfeits Counterfeiting is a significant challenge that can impair supply chains for both the public and private sectors. This challenge has increased with the rise of e -commerce, as DHS explained in its January 2020 report on Combating Trafficking in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods . In the context of the U.S. Government, acquiring products or services from sellers with inadequate integrity, security, resilience, and quality assurance controls create significant risks, from a national security and mission assurance perspective, as well as from an economic standpoint (due to the increased costs to American taxpayers). Counterfeiting can have significant consequences for the Department of Defense (DoD) supply chain by negatively affecting missions, the reliability of weapon systems, the safety of the warfighter, and the integrity of sensitive data and secure networks. The goal is to reduce the risk of counterfeits entering the supply chain; quickly and collectively address those that do enter the supply chain; and strengthen remedies against those who provide counterfeit items. DHS Training for Acquisition Professionals Buyers in the public and private sectors need better visibility into and understanding of (1) how the products, services, and solutions they buy are developed, int egrated, and deployed, and (2) the processes, procedures, and practices used to ensure the integrity, security, resilience, and quality of those products and services. This requires understanding the threat that counterfeits pose, mitigating their purchas e and distribution, and identifying counterfeits and reporting them. To address the systemic threat from counterfeits, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement -led National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (IPR Center) provides educational opportunities for public and private acquisition professionals. The IPR Center has coordinated with the ICE Chief Financial Officer to provide this training to all purchase card holders across the agency. Additionally, t he IPR Center has posted free training on its website that is designed to provide acquisition professionals with the knowledge and skills they need to combat the counterfeit threat . The training on Acquisition Professional Training: Counterfeit Awareness, Mitigation, Identification, and Reporting is at https://www.iprcenter.gov/file -repository/acquisition- professional -training -1.pdf/view . 65 China Working Group In 2020, DHS formed a China Working Group, made up of senior representatives of all DHS Components, with the goal of developing an action plan to protect and defend the nation against threats from the government of China sponsored online activities. The Working Group is overseen by the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary for Policy and has compiled a preliminary round of actions. In January 2021, DHS issued a report DHS Strategic Action Plan to Counter the Threat Posed by the People's R epublic of China, which documented the findings of the group. The Working Group wa s sub -divided into five workstreams, which we re operated at the staff level and managed by Component representatives. Of these, a representative from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) manage the Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure workstream. Participation include d staff from multiple CISA Divisions, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Secret Service, S cience and Technology, and Intelligence and Analysis . The Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure workstream was tasked with leading the development of action items in these relevant areas, including the prevention of intellectual property (IP) theft. The workstream generated actions related to increasing public and private sector engagement through awareness, training, and exercises; support for the granting of the administrative subpoena authority to CISA; facilitation of the protection of cloud servi ce providers, which have been used as a vector for Chinese government -sponsored offensive attacks; augmenting support for the U.S. academic sector, which holds significant IP data and is therefore a key target; studying the effect of emerging technologies, including Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) manufactured in China, on the vulnerability of IP and developing deterrence strategies; and developing a strategy to protect and defend U.S. IP from Chinese government - sponsored cyber espionage and data theft. The workstream also developed milestones for each of these areas. Law Enforcement Efforts to Secure the USG Supply Chain (Operation Chain Reaction) In addition to the steps taken to secure the front end of the U.S. Government's supply chain (through Federal procurement regulations, supplier requirements, and acquisition training), the U.S. Government is also committed to protecting its vital interests by taking robust enforcement measures against those who sell counterfeit goods to the U.S. Government. Operation Chain Reaction targets counterfeit items entering the military and U.S. Government supply chains, and is an IPR Center -coordinated effort led by ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and consists of 17 Federal law enforcement agencies (includi ng HSI, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and DoD's criminal investigative offices). In FY 2021, under Operation Chain Reaction , HSI initiated 31 criminal investigations, conducted 2 criminal arrests, and helped secure 1 indictment and 3 convicti ons, as well as 90 seizure incidents of counterfeit goods. 66 Other notable Operation Chain Reaction activities during FY 2021 included the following. On October 14, 2020, members of the IPR Center Operation Chain Reaction Task Force co-hosted the Counterfeit Microelectronics Working Group (CMWG) led by DOJ, Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS). This marked the first time the meeting was conducted as a virtual meeting due to the ongoing pandemic. The meeting primarily focused on trends in counterfeit electronic parts, but also highlighted a successful prosecution of an individual for knowingly engaging in criminal behavior which potentially could have introduced counterfeit microelectronics into the United States Space Program. Law Enforcement Operations Protection and enforcement of IPR is a national priority, and U.S. law enforcement stands at the forefront of these efforts. As of September 30, 2021, CBP and ICE made 27,115 IPR seizures. The tota l estimated manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of the seized goods, had they been genuine, was about $3.3 billion. In addition to Operation Chain Reaction (discussed above), the DHS law enforcement efforts during FY 2021 included the following operations : Operation Apothecary Operation Apothecary is the IPR Center's public health and safety initiative that addresses, analyzes, and attacks potential vul nerabilities in the entry process that might allow for the smuggling of commercial quantities of counterfeit, unapproved, and/or adulterated drugs through international mail facilities, express courier hubs, and land borders. On June 16, 2021, IPR Cente r personnel presented at the Drug Enforcement Administration's Chemical Industry Conference which was attended by approximately 200 representatives from private industry. The IPR Center provided a briefing on investigative programs and priorities with a f ocus on protecting pharmaceutical companies' intellectual property. During FY 2021, under Operation Apothecary , HSI initiated 49 criminal investigations, 19 arrests, 25 indictments, and 21 convictions, as well as 204 seizure incidents of counterfeit item s. E-Commerce/Operation in Our Sites The E- Commerce Program is an on -going HSI initiative targeting entities that sell counterfeit products through the internet. This program consists of the well -known operation, Operation in Our Sites (IOS), which was initiated in 2010 as a method to disrupt this activity online. The E - Commerce initiative focuses on developing long term investigations that identify targets, assets, and financial schemes used in operating infringing websites devoted to trafficking in infringing materials. It also emphasizes working in partnership with third -party entities, such as online 67 marketplaces, payment processors, and the express consignment industry. Additionally, the IPR Center coordinates with rightsholders, who utilize civil and administrative remedies to shutdown infringing sites. In recognition of the wide reach of e- commerce into many of its programmatic areas, HSI promulgated a single agency strategy on February 14, 2018. The HSI E -Commerce Strategy emphasizes an agency approach that leverages collaboration between private industry and law enforcement partners in an effort to act as a force- multiplier in a cooperative enforcement approach to identify and dismantle organizations, and to prosecute persons or entities, that traffic in all manners of dangerous and illicit goods utilizing various e -commerce outlets including open- net websites, the dark web, point -to-point sales platforms, social media, and a variety of payment processors and shipping methods. In FY 2021, in furtherance of the e -Commerce Strategy, IPR Center personnel conducted several meetings with representatives from online platforms, payment processors, and the shipping industry for the purpose of furthering dialogue about how to share i nformation for the purpose of stopping the online sale of counterfeit goods. On April 21, 2021, the IPR Center presented at a virtual Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade working group on the challenges of e- commerce and illicit trade. The IPR Center discussed the E -Commerce Working Group and the Anti -Counterfeiting Consortium to Identify Online Nefarious Actors (ACTION), including successes and challenges moving forward. Participants include d law enforcement representatives from the UK, and Australia, and OECD personnel. In FY 2021, under E -Commerce/IOS , HSI initiated 19 criminal investigations, conducted 2 arrests, and helped secure 1 indictment and 2 convictions. These investigations are initiated and developed by HSI field offices through IPR Center leads, seizures, informants, complaints, industry leads, and/or other investigative techniques. IOS Cyber Monday/Project Transatlantic Under IOS Cyber Monday/Project Transatlantic, the IPR Center - through HSI - partners with Europol to leverage its member countries to launch multilateral enforcement actions against targeted websites and their operators illegally selling counterfeit merchandise. The operation involves the execution of coordinated seizures of domestic and foreign -based internet domain name registrations in the United States and Europe. Through the ongoing international Operation \"In Our Sites,\" the IPR Center and Europol seized or shut down more than 490,475 websites illegal ly selling counterfeit goods and other copyright -protected material to unsuspecting consumers between November 2020 and November 2021. Operation Engine Newity Operation Engine Newity (OEN) is an HSI -led, IPR Center initiative that focuses on securing the supply chains of automotive and other heavy industry from counterfeit components. The proliferation of counterfeit parts - including critical components such as airbags, bearings, brake pads, accelerator arms, and windshields - has grown exponentially over the last several years and 68 now poses a significant health and safety threat to end users and an economic cost to businesses and consumers through lost revenue, downtime, and replacement costs. OEN personnel work closely with automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), aftermarket parts manufacturers and suppliers, and other automotive parts and equipment companies, including members of the Automotive Anti -Counterfeiting Council (A2C2) and the Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association (AASA) Intellectual Property Council. The companies support criminal investigations by providing case support and product authentication. On March 12, 2021, the IPR Center coordinated with Force Pierce HSI for Operation Engine Newity on targeting the importation and trafficking of counterfeit automotive merchandise.

OSP combines the expertise of HSI, CBP and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). From August 28- September 1, 2021, representatives of OSP worked in conjunction with CBP and HSI on an enforcement operation in Anchorage, Alaska that focused on identifyi ng counterfeit cellular phones being used in an ongoing fraud scheme. In FY 2021, under Operation Surge Protector, HSI initiated 8 criminal cases, conducted 6 arrests, and helped secure 3 indictments and 2 convictions. 69 Operation Body Armor Operation Body Armor , which combines the expertise of HSI, CBP, and FDA -OCI, was initiated in January 2015 by the IPR Center in partnership with industry and other entities associated with the healthcare and beauty product communit y to combat the sale of counterfeit personal healthcare and beauty products. In FY 2021, under Operation Body Armor , HSI initiated 28 crimina l cases, conducted 3 arrests, and seized counterfeit goods with an estimated MSRP (if genuine) of approximately $15.95 million. Operation Intangibles In December 2019, the IPR Center hosted the inaugural event for Operation Intangibles at the first ever HSI digital piracy symposium. This symposium brought law enforcement and CCI experts together to address stakeholders' concerns in copyright protection and enforcement efforts. This symposium further addressed collaborative efforts in countering digital piracy to further protect a vital sector of the U.S. economy. Through this initiative, the IPR Center collaborates with industry partners to develop effective digital piracy training for law enforcement and creates avenues of access to CCI subject matter and techincal experts for investigative assistance. This initiative merges HSI's foreign and domestic investigative resources with industry partners i n a global effort to counter the growth of digital piracy. Through Operation Intangibles , HSI investigative and operational programs will be more effective in targeting the entire digital piracy ecosystem for disruption and dismantlement. On June 23, 2021, the HSI Global Trade Investigations Division, IPR Center, hosted a Digital Piracy Virtual Training featuring presentations from DOJ and industry partners from MPA, RIAA and BSA. The purpose of this training was to facilitate information on emerging technology, terminology, and other impact indicators specific to the industry. Attendees included investigators from HSI and FBI from field offices around the country. On July 8, 2021, HSI DC executed three seizure warrants for thirteen commercial website domain names offering unauthorized copyright -protected content . The enforcement action was part of a Government of Brazil -led international operation targeting digital piracy dubbed \"Operation 404.\" This was an HSI DC led investigation with signif icant support from HSI EDVA, ICHIP and CCIPS; and Brazil entities. Operation Team Player Operation Team Player (OTP) targets the sale and trafficking of counterfeit sports merchandise, apparel and tickets, a multi -million- dollar criminal industry. The culmination of the sports season \u2014playoffs and finals games \u2014are events that stimulate the sale of counterfeit items. HSI Special Agents and CBP Officers worked with sports leagues and law enforcement agencies 70 throughout t he nation to identify shipments of counterfeit sports merchandise being imported to the United States or being sold by vendors.

In FY 2021, HSI init iated 715 intellectual property investigations and was involved in 206 arrests, 101 indictments, and 77 convictions. In FY 2021, the IPR Center vetted 13,331 investigative leads; of these, 11,633 were referred to law enforcement partners. Finally, the IPR Center de -conflicted 1,698 investigative targets for partner agencies and industry. In FY 2021, due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the IPR Center adapted the Intellectual Property and Trade Enforcement Investigations (IPTEI) training course to the online environment, modifying the curriculum to offer an introductory version suitable for web-based learning. Four online sessions (20 training hours each) were held in FY 2021, with a total of 630 participants. (Previously, in -person courses were held at the IPR Center in Arlington, VA, between August 2016 until August 2019 with 30 attendees at ea ch session, comprised of CBP and HSI personnel.) The IPTEI course offers advanced training with a specific focus on commercial fraud and IP theft. Presenters are CBP and HSI subject matter experts in selected topics and programs. The course is evaluated through anonymous online surveys which are used to review and enhance the training curriculum. HSI and CBP field personnel are the target audience for this training (previously managed and held by the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers), which also supports the educational requirement of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. Additional attendees may include representatives from the IPR Center partner agencies, DHS, and DOJ, as well as Task Force Officers placed within HSI field offices representing local and federal law enforcement. In FY 2021, the CBP Office of Trade adapted the Instructor Led Training (ILT) course material to the virtual environment. The ILT training is an introductory course for CBP officers detailing CBP's regulatory authorities and the IPR seizure process. Previously, ILT courses were hosted in -person at individual ports. However, in FY 2021, the Office of Trade IPR Division hosted six virtual ILT sessions , which were attended by approximately 170 partic ipants. In addition, the webinar recordings have been made available online to all CBP personnel and have generated over 430 views . 73 The IPR Center continues to provide overview and case studies on investigations worked with CBP at a three -day CBP trade e nforcement advanced training event. Due to COVID cancellations in FY 2020, the IPR Center conducted two events with a total of 71 CBP and ICE personnel attending. In FY 2021, the IPR Center participated in four events with 224 CBP and ICE attendees. The training focuses on fines, penalties, and forfeitures, and is designed for trade enforcement coordinators and import specialists; also attending are CBP officers, paralegals, assistant port directors for trade, and entry specialists. The training course provides participants with the background necessary to evaluate and prioritize prospective trade violations (including AD/CVD), determine resource allocation and the appropriate enforcement response (including penalties and liquidated damages), and track and monitor results of enforcement actions. During each class, ICE provides an overview of the IPR Center and HSI's IPR and trade enforcement efforts. Engaging with Stakeholders The IPR Center forms the communications hub around which much of the interaction between private sector stakeholders and the law enforcement and regulatory communities takes place. The January 2020 DHS report on Combating Trafficking in Counterfeit and P irated Goods recommended numerous \"Immediate Actions by DHS and Recommendations for the U.S. Government.\" Recommendation six acknowledged the work of the IPR Center E -Commerce Working Group (ECWG) and recommended the formation of the Anti -Counterfeiting Consortium to Identify Online Nefarious Actors (ACTION). In furtherance of this objective, the IPR Center hosted three meetings in FY 2021 with 14 industry members of the ACTION group and our federal partner agencies at the IPR Center. On October 7, 2020, the IPR Center hosted the second quarterly ACTION meeting. During this meeting, 14 ACTION members engaged in discussions concerning the Private Sector Best Practices that were outlined in the January 2020 DHS report. ACTION members provided the IPR Center with data concerning how their existing best practices aligned with any or all best practices outlined in the DHS Report. On January 27, 2021, the IPR Center hosted the third quarterly ACTION meeting. During the meeting 14 ACTION members discussed the private sector responses received by the IPR Center with regards to existing best practices. ACTION members also discussed the definition of \"high-risk\" merchandise, and determined that designating a standard definition of high risk merchandise wou ld allow ACTION members to work together more efficiently at targeting these items. As a result, the group agreed to form a High- Risk Working Group (HRWG) to further discuss this issue and develop a standard definition that the ACTION group could use movi ng forward. On February 26, 2021, the HRWG held its initial meeting with seven ACTION members. The HRWG agreed that having a standard definition for high risk would be beneficial to support future investigative/operational issues they participate in. The group also discussed the importance of two- way sharing of intelligence, especially related to new trends identified by either private sector or government entities. A recommendation was made for the IPR Center to 74 develop a series of awareness bulletin s which would share data with the private sector in three areas: High Risk, High Volume, and Trending. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Memorandum of Understanding In May 2021, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection sig ned a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (CoC) , the first of its kind. This MOU underscores the importance of IPR and outlines general terms on connecting resources and sharing information between the two organizations to stop the flow of trade in counterfeit goods. This includes the exchange of infor mation concerning known or suspected intellectual property rights violations, the intention to conduct joint training and outreach events, and joint public awareness of efforts to disrupt the trade in counterfeit and pirated goods. CBP Product ID Guide We binars In FY 2021, the CBP Office of Trade hosted nineteen Product ID Guide webinars, reaching approximately 2,200 CBP and HSI personnel. These webinars are an opportunity for rightsholders to engage directly with CBP Officers to introduce their products, present key identifying marks for genuine goods, and highlight counterfeiting trends and areas of risk specific to their products. The we binar recordings and corresponding Product ID Guides are also made available online to all CBP and HSI personnel. Operation Joint Venture and P roject Trade Watch Through the IPR Center's Outreach and Training Section, HSI engages in partnerships with the public and private sectors to combat IP infringement through its Operation Joint Venture (OJV) initiative. This IPR Center- led outreach initiative is designed to increase information sharing with public and private sectors to combat the illegal importation and distribution of counterfeit, substandard and tainted goods, as well as the evasion of duties. The initiative is aimed at fostering investigations into comme rcial fraud, including activities that threaten public health and safety and violate IP rights. Through OJV, the IPR Center engages with rightsholders, manufacturers, importers, customs brokers, freight forwarders, bonded facilities, carriers, and others to discuss the IPR Center's priorities of protecting public health and safety, the economy, and the U.S. Government's supply chain. Through outreach and public engagement, the IPR Center raises the public's awareness of the dangers of commercial fraud vio lations (such as those involving IP) and serves as a public point of contact for investigative leads. The IPR Center's audience includes a broad spectrum of industries and government agencies, including but not limited to the pharmaceutical, entertainment, wearing apparel, sports, electronic, and automobile industries, as well as customs bonded entities, importers, and law enforcement officials. Project Trade Watch is HSI and CBP's outreach campaign to the importing comm unity to facilitate informed compliance by private industry and to enhance public awareness of law enforcement efforts within the trade commu nity. This campaign exists under the IPR Center's broader OJV initiative . Through Project Trade Watch , HSI and CBP field personnel provide information and red-flag indicators of potential import fraud and importer identity theft. 75 Other Engagements DHS law enforcement agencies which support IP enforcement had numerous other engagements with stakeholders during FY 2021. Some of these public education and outreach efforts are described below. The IPR Center has a unique role within HSI by serving as a one -stop shop for IP enforcement efforts. In this role, the IPR Center has regular contact with the international community, the media, Member s of Congress, trade organizations, industry leaders, and the general public. In FY 2021, the IPR Center conducted 71 outreach and training events with 5,514 attendees. In FY 2021, the IPR Center continued the monthly publication of the IPRC Connections newsletter to keep stakeholders up to date on the most significant IPR Center enforcement efforts and outreach activities. Additionally, the IPR Center collects, tabulates, and catalogs victim impact accounts of brand holders and consumers with the aim to show more clearly the full effect of IP infringement and trade fraud on the U.S. and global economies, public health and safety, and any related threat to government supply chains. Throughout FY 2021, HSI - through its leadership at the IPR Center - collaborated with industry and other government agencies to present training and foster communication. Examples of this include: Cooperated with Underwriters Laboratories (UL, LLC) to deliver virtual training to HSI and CBP personnel, including topics such as the new UL label requirements and combating counterfeit battery products. Partnered with Philip Morris International (PMI) to offer virtual training in combating illicit trade in tobacco products, trafficking, finance and other criminal -related act ivity. Audiences included HSI special agents, analysts, task force officers, and members of the Transnational Criminal Investigative Units (TCIUs), as well as HSI overseas offices, with sessions dedicated to specific geographical regions. Engaged the Aut omotive Anti -Counterfeiting Council (A2C2) to provide case -study training addressing counterfeit automobile parts. Collaborated with DOJ Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and USPTO to provide virtual training on various IP Enforcem ent topics and COVID -19- related fraud. Liaised with CBP Office of Trade in numerous virtual training opportunities in combating commercial fraud and intellectual property rights enforcement. During FY 2021, the IPR Center's Outreach and Training Section assisted with the coordination of approximately 7 meetings with industries and coalitions including JUUL, National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC), Philip Morris International (PMI), Practicing Lawyers Institute (PLI), International Association of Chiefs of Police 76 (IACP), International Trademark Association (INTA), International Consumer Product Health and Safety Organization, and International Anti -Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC). IPR Center HSI personnel assigned to the National Cyber -Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) leverage the resources and analytical tools of the NCFTA to identify domain names and networks affiliated with infringing activity in support of criminal investigations or potential civil enforcement action. (The NCFTA is a non -profit corporation that conducts real -time information sharing and analysis with subject matter experts in the public and private sectors and academia.) CBP's multi -faceted communication with IP stakeholders includes daily interaction with industry regar ding enforcement activities, formal meetings involving both trade facilitation and enforcement efforts, and participation in numerous national trade events. CBP's stakeholder engagement includes: o Regular conference calls with the IPR working group of the Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee (COAC) and quarterly public meetings with COAC members; o Daily interaction with stakeholders affected by CBP's IP enforcement efforts at the ports of entry, and nationally through CBP's ten industry -aligned Centers of Excellence and Expertise (Centers), the IP -focused staff at headquarters, and the IPR Center in the Washington, DC metro area; o Participation in national and local trade events, industry meetings, speaking engagements, and industry- specific righ tsholder roundtables. Throughout FY 2021, CBP collaborated with industry in the form of an e -commerce task force to identify and address t he complexities and challenges associated with the increases in small packages due to the worldwide proliferation of online and mobile technologies. The DHS Private Sector Office (PSO) continues to coordinate U.S. G overnment -wide efforts to catalyze and support private sector and non- governmental -based counter -illicit trade activities. On the international stage, PSO s eeks to coordinate conferences and workshops in key global locations (e.g., Asia, Eastern Europe, and Western Hemisphere) to collaborate on U.S. and international government efforts to bolster enforcement through the sharing of best practices and approache s for detecting and disrupting illicit trade activities. The U.S. Department of State is key to this effort as their respective Missions work with host governments to strengthen their enforcement regimes. Educating the Public Changing public attitudes toward infringing activities remains essential to an effective intellectual property enforcement strategy. DHS activities during FY 2021 included: CBP's Centers of Excellence and Expertise have been heavily involved in the development and implementation of the trade intelligence concept, a CBP effort to 77 establish formal linkages with the private sector to develop actionable intelligence. As part of these efforts, the Centers engage in continual dialogue, information sharing, and trend analysis (e.g., with the pharmaceutical industry) in order to safeguard the American public from substandard, counterfeit, or otherwise illegal products. CBP proactively and frequently issues national and local press releases, and social media notifications to educate the pu blic on counterfeiting. In FY 2021, the IPR Center - in partnership with Michigan State University's Center for Anti-Counterfeiting and Product Protection (A -CAPP), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the Better Business Bureau , and with the assistance of the USPTO - launched IP Protect . The joint initiative provides resources - free of charge - to aid small to medium - sized enterprises (SMEs) in protecting themselves against IP theft, fraud, and cyber intrusion. One of the primary goals of IP Protect is to have special agents meet with local government and community organizations to facilitate connections with the companies that can benefit most from the initiative. Once these connections are made, special agents can communicate directly with local SMEs to raise awareness about exposures that can leave them at risk to IP loss and fraud and provide a local point of contact for reporting fraud and suspicious activity. In FY 2021, CBP continued the Truth Behind Counterfeits IPR Public Awareness Campaign to educate the public of the many harms associated with the purchase of counterfeit goods. The goal of the campaign is to make people aware that buying counterfeits is not a victimless crime and to encourage them to shop from reputable sources. Due to COVI D-19, CBP pivoted its consumer education campaign to leverage existing digital platforms and utilize its relationships with trade associations and partner government agencies (PGAs) to bring awareness about the danger of counterfeit goods. This included a three -pronged approach, using traditional media avenues as well as CBP's social media presence ( e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.); CBP's IPR Website presence (including the Fake Goods Real Dangers campaign webpage); and CBP's partnerships with government agencies and trade associations with a nexus to stopping trade in illegitimate goods that violate IPR of American businesses. To supplement the IPR Public Awareness Campaign, CBP organized and fac ilitated three publicly available webinars. These events took place throughout FY 2021 and emphasized the role CBP plays in stopping counterfeits from entering the United States . Cooperating with Foreign Law Enforcement As discussed above, DHS law enfo rcement agencies regularly cooperate with other Federal law enforcement agencies and with law enforcement offices in other countries. Below are especially notable examples of DHS cooperation with foreign law enforcement. In FY 2021, as discussed above, U .S. law enforcement and Federal agencies - including the IPR Center through HSI, CBP, and FDA - participated in Operation Pangea, a global enforcement effort led by INTERPOL that is aimed at disrupting organized crime networks behind the illicit 78 online sal e of fake drugs. The majority of Pangea participant countries conducted a week of coordinated enforcement efforts from May 17- 21, 2021. Through the U.S.- China IP Criminal Enforcement Working Group , DOJ and U.S. law enforcement (including HSI and FBI) maintain a steady exchange of information and case leads with Chinese law enforcement, resulting in successful operations to disrupt the manufacture of counterfeit items, such as airbags, pharmaceutica ls, batteries, electronic components, and luxury items. During FY 2021, the IPR Center was unable to physically host foreign government officials with an interest in IP enforcement at the IPR Center due to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic. However, the IPR Center continued to engage foreign counterparts virtually in meetings and various outreach and training efforts. Among these were representatives from Australia, Canada, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Moldova, Mongolia, Norway, Panama, the Philippines , Thailand, and the UK. Capacity Building and Training DHS engages in training and capacity building programs to strengthen intellectual property awareness and enforcement internationally. CBP provided trainers for Department of Justice and HSI -led regional international forums on IP enforcement for foreign governments. In FY 2021, this included HSI -led training in the Dominican Republic. The IPR Center works closely with partner USG agencies, overseas attach\u00e9s, and U.S. embassies to deliver training and support capacity building efforts across the globe. These efforts are conducted through multiple channels, including th e interagency International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) program, INTERPOL programs, and the Global Intellectual Property Rights Foreign Law Enforcement Training and Technical Assistance Initiative that is funded through the Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). This initiative - administered cooperatively by the IPR Center , DOJ CCIPS, DOJ OPDAT, and USPTO - is designed to complement the U.S. Transnational and High Tech Crime Global Law Enforcement Network (GLEN) in developing and delivering training and technical assistance on IPR and computer crimes to foreign partners in the investigative, prosecutorial, judicial, and customs and border enforcement areas. The initiative is designed to strengthen the enforcement capacity of these foreign partners for IPR matters involving transnational organized crime. Through this initi ative, the IPR Center , in conjunction with HSI Attach\u00e9 offices , directs, organizes, and delivers regional IPR training in the form of lectures and presentations to foreign customs, police, prosecutors, and magistrates. The IPR Center training programs are typically held in person for 3- 5 days and focus on the investigation and prosecution of IPR violations and associated crimes like smuggling and money laundering. (The COVID- 19 pandemic had a significant impact on the IPR Center's ability to deliver these programs in the field, and many were condensed and moved to virtual platforms in FY 2021.) The training programs are interactive workshops led by subject matter experts and focus particular on health and safety counterfeited items such as pharmaceuticals, electronics, automotive parts, and health and beauty products. With the growing number of e -commerce marketplaces, the training programs also 79 focus on internet investigations . Private sector representatives or associations are invited to participate in many of the training programs to highlight the challenges their industry sector may face in a particular region and to highlight the necessity of government and industry cooperation. In FY 2021, the IPR Center participated in 37 international training and outreache s in support of these programs. HSI continues to work closely with its law enforcement counterparts, particularly those who received training in IP enforcement. The following are e xamples of events that HSI either organized or supported via this program.

The first part is based on DOJ's report to Congress for FY 2020 under Section 404 of the PRO IP Act. The second part discusses the Department's activities during FY 2021 relating to intellectual property protection and enforcement . I. The Justice Department's report to Congress f or FY 2020 under the PRO IP Act. The Department of Justice (the \"Department\" or \"DOJ\") submits an annual report to Congress pursuant to Section 404 of the Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008 (\"PRO IP Act\" or \"Act\"), Pub. L. No. 110- 403. The following is the Pro IP Act Annual Report for FY 2020 reproduced in its entirety. The Pro IP Act imposes a number of annual reporting requirements on the Attorney General, including actions the Department has taken to implement Title IV of the Act (\"Department of Justice Programs\") and \"a summary of the efforts, activities, and resources the [Department] has allocated to the enforcement, investigation, and prosecution of intellectual property crimes.\" The A ct requires similar reporting by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") on its intellectual property (\"IP\") enforcement efforts pursuant to Title IV of the Act. To the extent a particular request seeks information maintained by the FB I, the Department respectfully refers Congress to the FBI Fiscal Year 2020 Report to Congress on Intellectual Property Enforcement (\"FBI's Annual Report\"). Section 404(a) of the PRO IP Act requires the Attorney General to report annually to Congress on the Department's efforts to implement eight specified provisions of Title IV during the prior fiscal year. Those provisions and the Department's efforts to implement them during FY 2020 are set forth below. In addition, working closely with the Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (\"IPEC\"), the Department contributes to strategic planning and implementation as well as the IPEC's annual reports. 87 (a)(1) State and Local Law Enforcement Grants In FY 2020, the Office of Justice Programs (\"OJP\") awarded grants to support state and local IP law enforcement task forces under statutory authority provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 Pub. L. No. 116- 93, 133 Stat. 2317, 2407, and as informed by Section 401 of the PRO IP Act.

Of this total amount of funding, state and local law enforcement agencies have received over $25.2 million. Throughout the duration of the program, these agencies have made seizures totaling over $1.029 billion, which includes counterfeit merchandise and other property as well as currency. During the one -year period July 1, 2019 - June 30, 2020, grantees reported seizures totaling $70,249,205 ( $69,554,628 in counterfeit merchandise, $560,196 in other property, and $134,381 in currency). Over this same one -year period, grantees engaged in the following law enforcement activities: 204 individuals were arrested for violations of IP laws; 73 state and local IP search warrants were served; and 197 piracy/counterfeiting organizations were disrupted or dismantled. Examples of how state and local law enforcement used prior IPEP grants in FY 2020 include: The City of Austin, TX IP Crime task force made significant progress in an on- going, lengthy investigation targeting the selling and possessing of counterfeit items, such as socce r jerseys. The operation included purchasing counterfeit items from the suspected person as well as the suspected place. Officers conducted hours of surveillance to determine where the suspected person lived, where the suspected person was storing the coun terfeit items, and where the suspected person was coming from. Officers also worked to submit the items of 89 evidence in a professional manner to prepare for possible courtroom testimony. The detective assigned to the case began preparing a search warrant fo r the suspected place. Officers later executed the signed search warrant. Officers seized over $10,000 MSRP worth of counterfeit clothing items. The investigation is ongoing, and the task force members are also pursuing three different counterfeit leads t hat may lead to operations in the future. The Counterfeit and Piracy Enforcement team in Los Angeles County conducted counterfeit investigations resulting in multiple arrests, the dismantling of five counterfeit organizations, and the seizure of approxima tely 5,800 counterfeit products with an MSRP of over $5 million. BJA continues to support one -day training events on IP rights for state and local law enforcement agencies across the country through cooperative agreements with the National White Collar Crime Center (\"NW3C\"). Between October 1, 2019, and September 30, 2020, NW3C conducted these training sessions for 398 attendees from 319 agencies. During this time, NW3C also conducted relevant IP webinars, training 1,802 attendees from 1,167 agencies. N W3C also continued to provide technical assistance to IPEP grantee task forces, as well as maintain and update asynchronous 24/7 online IP theft training. Since the inception of the program, BJA has supported the following: 121 IP theft trainings for 3,005 attendees from 1,612 agencies 18 seminars/webinars for 2,340 attendees from 1,352 agencies 785 attendees from 652 agencies successfully completed web -based training and utilized online resources specific to IP investigations 44 technical assistance meetings for 573 attendees from 135 agencies NW3C continues to manage IPTheft.org to provide a common place for IPEP grantees and law enforcement to find training, resources, and technical assistance that will aid in their intellectual property theft inve stigations. The website contains legal resources for prosecutors and judges as well as resources for the general public. Examples of how attendees utilized the training and technical assistance include: Chicago Police Department detectives attended NW3C Intellectual Property Rights (\"IPR\") training and, after the course, requested assistance from NW3C instructors in analyzing financial records and determining prosecutorial strategy. NW3C instructors guided the detectives through tracing and seizing bank a ccounts which resulted in identifying and filing felony charges against multiple suspects. The outcome of this case is pending. Detroit Police detectives investigating IP theft contacted NW3C instructors and asked for subpoena templates for financial institutions. In addition to providing the templates, NW3C instructors explained how to set up a controlled buy, manage the large amount of evidence that accumulates in IPR cases, and 90 establish contact with brand holders. (a)(2) Additional Agents of FBI Please see the FBI's Annual Report, which will be submitted separately pursuant to Section 404(c) of the PRO IP Act. (a)(3) FBI Training Please see the FBI's Annual Report, which will be submitted separately pursuant to Section 404(c) of the PRO IP Act. (a)(4) Organized Crime Plan As in FY 2009 through FY 2019, Congress did not appropriate funds to support Section 402(b) of the PRO IP Act in FY 2020.5 Nevertheless, the Department has continued to take a number of actions in an effort to implement this provision. The actions, described below, include (1) increased information sharing and coordination and (2) training and outreach. 5 Section 402(b) provides that \"[s]ubject to the availability of appropriati ons to carry out this subsection, and not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Attorney General, through the United States Attorneys' Offices, the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property section, and the Organized Crime and Racketeering section of the Department of Justice, and in consultation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other Federal law enforcement agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, shall create and implement a comprehensive, long -range plan to investigate and prosecute international organized crime syndicates engaging in or supporting crimes relating to the theft of intellectual property.\" \"(2) With respect to the additional agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation authorized under paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 402(a), the number of investigations and actions in which such agents were engaged, the type of each action, the resolution of each action, and any penalties imposed in each action.\" \"(3) With respect to the training program authorized under section 402(a)(4), the number of agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation participating in such program, the elements of the training program, and the subject matters covered by the program.\" \"(4) With respect to the organized crime plan authorized under section 402(b), the number of organized crime investigations and prosecutions resulting from such plan.\" 91 However, the Department will not be able to provide a specific number of prosecutions directly resulting from these increased efforts for at least two reasons. First, the Department can retrieve statistical information from its database based on the statute charged but not based on the type of defendant or group that committed the offense. Second, it is difficult to determine whether prosecutions involving organized crime groups have resulted directly from these organized crime plan efforts or other ongoing efforts. In addition to the ongoing activities detailed in PRO IP Act Reports for fiscal years 2009 through 2020, the Department has taken the following additional actions to address this important issue: Increased Information Sharing and Coordination The Department, through the Criminal Division, is continuing to coordinate with federal investigatory agencies to work with the International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center in an ongoing effort to develop and implement a mechanism to contribute data to the Ce nter to address intelligence gaps as they relate to IP, among other things. The Center has provided operational, intelligence, and financial support to investigations where international organized crime groups are involved in IP offenses. Training and Out reach In FY 2020, the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (\"CCIPS\") of the DOJ's Criminal Division has continued to strengthen the Department's ability to combat organized IP crime through training and outreach with international counterparts and organizations, which often encounter IP crime committed by organized crime groups. These training and outreach activities are described in section (a)(7)(B) of this Report. Executive Order On February 9, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order on Enforcing Federal Law with Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing International Trafficking. DOJ is working together in partnership with the Department of State, Depa rtment of Homeland Security, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to implement Executive Order 13773. As part of this implementation, DOJ will continue to address the links between transnational criminal organizations and IP crime. 92 (a)(5) Authorized Funds Under Section 403 Section 403 related to funds appropriated during FY 2009-2013. In FY 2020, funds were neither appropriated under this section nor expended based on funds previously appropriated under this section. Information about the cases, defendants, and types of investigations carried out by the Department may be found in greater detail below. Please see the FBI's Annual Report, pr ovided separately under Section 404(c) of the PRO IP Act, for details on FBI allocation of resources. (a)(6) Other Relevant Information The Department did not receive any authorizations under Sections 402 and 403 of the PRO IP Act in FY 2020. \"(5) With respect to the authorizations under section 403 \u2014 (A) the number of law enforcement officers hired and the number trained; (B) the number and type of investigations and prosecutions resulting from the hiring and training of such law enforcement officers; (C) the defendants involved in any such prosecutions; (D) any penalties imposed in each such successful prosecution; (E) the advanced tools of forensic science procured to investigate, prosecute, and study computer hacking or intellectual property crimes; and (F) the number and type of investigations and prosecutions in which such tools were used.\" \"(6) Any other information that the Attorney General may consider relevant to inform Congress on the effective use of the resources authorized under sections 401, 402, and 403.\" 93 (a)(7) Efforts, Activities and Resources Allocated to the Enforcement of IP Crimes \"(7) A summary of the efforts, activities, and resources the Department of Justice has allocated to the enforcement, investigation, and prosecution of intellectual property crimes, including - (A) a review of the policies and efforts of the Department of Justice related to the prevention and investigation of intellectual property crimes, including efforts at the Office of Justice Programs, the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, the Executive Office of United States Attorneys, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office of Legal Policy, and any other agency or bureau of the Department of Justice whose activities relate to intellectual property; (B) a summary of the overall successes and fa ilures of such policies and efforts; (C) a review of the investigative and prosecution activity of the Department of Justice with respect to intellectual property crimes, including - (i) the number of investigations initiated related to such crimes; (ii) the number of arrests related to such crimes; and (iii) the number of prosecutions for such crimes, including\u2014 (I) the number of defendants involved in such prosecutions; (II) whether the prosecution resulted in a conviction; and (III) the sentence and the statutory maximum for such crime, as well as the average sentence imposed for such crime; and (D) a Department -wide assessment of the staff, financial resources, and other resources (such as time, technology, and training) devoted to the enforcement, investigation, and prosecution of i ntellectual property crimes, including the number of investigators, prosecutors, and forensic specialists dedicated to investigating and prosecuting intellectual property crimes.\" (a)(7)(A) Review of the Department's Policies and Efforts Relating to the Prevention and Investigation of IP Crimes The Department investigates and prosecutes a wide range of IP crimes, including those involving copyrighted works, trademarks, and trade secrets. Primary investigative and prosecutorial responsibility within the D epartment rests with the FBI, the United States Attorneys' Offices, CCIPS in the Criminal Division, the Counterintelligence and Export 94 Control Section (\"CES\") in the National Security Division (\"NSD\"), and, with regard to offenses arising under the Food, D rug, and Cosmetic Act, the Consumer Protection Branch of the Civil Division. Each of these components is described briefly below. In addition to enforcing existing criminal laws protecting IP, the Department has continued its tradition of contributing to major legislative developments updating criminal IP laws, including: the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, which was notable not only for creating a federal civil cause of action for misappropriation of trade secrets, but also increased criminal fines for organizational defendants who steal commercial trade secrets, and allowed prosecutors to bring racketeering charges based on the theft of trade secrets; the Foreign and Economic Espionage Penalty Enhancement Act of 2012, which increased fines for theft of trade secrets committed with the intent to benefit a foreign entity; the Theft of Trade Secrets Clarification Act of 2012, which clarified that the Economic Espionage Act applies to trade secrets that are \"related to a product or service used or intended f or use in interstate or foreign commerce\"; the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2012, which enhanced penalties for certain offenses involving counterfeit military goods; the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which created a new offense for trafficking in counterfeit drugs; the PRO IP Act of 2008; the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005, which criminalized \"camcording\" (the illegal copying of movies in a theater) and unauthorized distribution of pre -release works over the Internet; the No Electronic Theft Act of 1997, which criminalized the unauthorized reproduction and distribution of copyrighted works even without a commercial purpose or financial gain; and the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, which criminalized the theft of trade secrets, including economic espionage. 6 The Department made substantial contributions to the criminal enforcement proposals contained in the Administration's White Paper on Intellectual Property Enforcement Legislative Recommendations (March 2011), the majority of which (described above) were enacted into law, with the exception of felony penalties for copyright infringement by online streaming. The Department looks forward to working with Congress as it considers additional proposals. The Department coordinated closely with the IPEC in addressing the Administration's priorities on IP enforcement and implementing the IPEC's FY 2017-2019 Joint Strategic Plan (\"JSP\") on Intellectual Property Enforcement. CCIPS and CHIP Program The Department carries out its overall IP criminal prosecution mission through the United States Attorneys' Offices and CCIPS, which works closely with a network of over 270 specially trained federal prosecutors who make up the Department's Computer Hacking an d Intellectual Property (\"CHIP\") program. 6 For an overview of the Department's policies and efforts in the five years prior to the enactment of the PRO IP Act in October 2008, the Department's PRO IP Act First Annual Report 2008 -2009 may be found online at http s://w ww.justice.gov/iptf/pro -ip-act-reports. The Department's FY 2010 -FY 2019 PRO IP Reports are available at the same location. 95 CCIPS is a section within the Criminal Division consisting of a specialized team of forty - six prosecutors who are devoted to enforcing laws related to computer and IP crimes. Fifteen CCIPS attorneys are assigned exclusively to IP enforcement. These attorneys prosecute criminal cases, assist prosecutors and investigative agents in the field, and help develop and implement the Department's overall IP enforcement strategy and legislative priorities. CCIPS attorneys are available to provide advice and guidance to agents and prosecutors on a 24/7 basis. CCIPS attorneys also provide training on criminal enforcement of IP laws to prosecutors and investigative agents both domestically and abroad. CCIPS also houses the Cybe rcrime Lab, which provides support in evaluating digital evidence in IP cases. The Lab is currently staffed with eight computer forensics experts. In addition to evaluating digital evidence, the Lab's experts have provided extensive training on the use of digital forensics tools in IP cases to law enforcement audiences around the world. CCIPS continues to place a high priority on fostering international cooperation and coordination of criminal IP enforcement efforts. The Section has developed relationships with foreign law enforcement through international casework as well as through training and outreach. An important component of the Department's international enforcement efforts is the U.S. Transnational and High Tech Crime Global Law Enforcement Network (\"GLEN\") of regional International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (\"ICHIP\") attorneys (formerly, the Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordinator (\"IPLEC\") program). With the support of the State Department, DOJ has posted ICHIPs in Bucha rest, Nigeria; Bangkok, Thailand; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and The Hague, Netherlands. The GLEN also now includes two ICHIPs based in Washington, D.C., to serve as global subject matter experts on dark web and c ryptocurrency issues and internet -based fraud and public health issues; and a Global Cyber Forensic Advisor, also based in Washington, D.C. In 2020, the Network expanded to include regional ICHIPs based in Panama City, Panama; Zagreb, Croatia; and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The CHIP program is a network of experienced and specially trained federal prosecutors who aggressively pursue computer crime and IP offenses. Each of the 94 United States Attorneys' Offices has one or more CHIP coordinator. In addition, 25 United States Attorneys' Offices have CHIP Units, with two or more CHIP attorneys. 7 CHIP attorneys have four major areas of responsibility including: (1) prosecuting computer crime and IP offenses; (2) serving as the district's legal counsel on matters r elating to those offenses and the collection of electronic evidence; (3) training prosecutors and law enforcement personnel in the region; and (4) conducting public and industry outreach and awareness 7 CHIP Units are currently located in Alexandria, Virginia; Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Baltimore, Maryland; Boston, Texas; Colorado; Michigan; Missouri; Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; Newark, New Jersey; New Haven, Connecticut; New York, New York; Orlando, Florida; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Sacramento, California; San Diego, California; San Jose, California; Seattle, Washington; and Washington, D.C. 96 activities. CES and the NSCS Network Within NSD, CES \u2014one of NSD's principal litigating components \u2014is responsible for coordinating and conducting investigations and prosecutions of a wide variety of national security offenses, including economic espionage.8 In June 2015, NSD, recognizing the increasingly acut e and costly threat that economic espionage poses to the U.S. national and economic security, released its \"Strategic Plan for Countering the Economic Espionage Threat.\" This plan aims to heighten awareness of the threat in order to deter and mitigate economic espionage. The plan also seeks to coordinate efforts within the government to counter the threat, including through operational disruption, increased and improved training, and the provision of technical advice and expertise. In January 2017, CES rele ased its \"Strategic Plan for Countering the National Security Cyber Threat,\" which recognizes that our nation's adversaries are also stealing intellectual property through cyber -enabled means and proposes a strategy specifically designed to disrupt such ef forts. NSD is currently in the process of implementing both plans. In 2012, the Department established the National Security Cyber Specialists (\"NSCS\") Network to create a \"one- stop-shop\" for attorneys, investigators, and members of the private sector loo king to combat national security cyber thefts \u2014including economic espionage and trade secret theft \u2014with all appropriate legal tools. Each U.S. Attorney's Office has at least one representative to the NSCS Network, and NSCS Network representatives have conve ned annually in the D.C. area for specialized training focusing on legal and other issues at the intersection of national security and cybersecurity. The NSCS representative provides technical and specialized assistance to his or her colleagues within the relevant U.S. Attorney's Office and serves as a point of contact for coordination with the Department's headquarters. At headquarters, all NSD components, CCIPS, and other relevant sections of the Criminal Division are members of the Network. The Departmen t relies on the NSCS Network to disseminate intelligence and other information to the field, to train prosecutors on investigating national security cybercrimes, and to coordinate and de - conflict national security cyber investigations. Interagency Coordin ation In addition to investigating and prosecuting IP crime, the Department has worked closely with federal law enforcement agencies directly, and through the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (\"IPR Center\"), to improve IP enforcem ent domestically and overseas. 9 These activities have included training investigators and 8 In 2015, CES changed its name from the \"Counterespionage Section\" to the \"Counterintelligence and Export Control Section\" to better reflect the scope of its work. 9 These federal agencies include Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\"), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"), the United States Postal Inspection Service ( \"USPIS\"), the Food and Drug Administration's (\"FDA\") Office of Criminal Investigations, the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the Defense Logis tics Agency's Office of Inspector General, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations (\"ICE -HSI\"), the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\"), the 97 prosecutors in the investigation and prosecution of IP crimes; contributing to the Office of the United States Trade Representative's Special 301 process of evaluatin g the adequacy of our trading partners' criminal IP laws and enforcement regimes; helping to catalogue and review the United States government's IP training programs abroad; and implementing an aggressive international program to promote cooperative enforc ement efforts with our trading partners and to improve substantive laws and enforcement regimes in other countries. (a)(7)(B) Summary of Overall Successes and Failures of Such Policies and Efforts The Department achieved notable success in FY 2020 both domestically and abroad. Some of these efforts are highlighted below: Prosecution Initiatives The Department continues to prioritize IP investigations and prosecutions that involve (1) health and safety, (2) trade secret theft or economic espionage, and (3) large -scale commercial counterfeiting and online piracy. The Department has also increased its focus on IP crimes that are committed or facilitated by use of the Internet or perpetrated by organized criminal networks. (1) Health and Safety The Department's health and safety initiative brings together private, state, and federal enforcement resources to address the proliferation of counterfeit goods posing a danger to consumers, including counterfeit and illegally prescribed pharmaceuticals, auto motive parts, and military goods. In FY 2020, this initiative resulted in a number of significant prosecutions, including those set forth below: Online Drug Dealer Sentenced to 15 Years for Distributing Counterfeit Pills Containing Fentanyl that Caused Overdose Death. On October 16, 2019, Trevon Antone Lucas was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison for selling counterfeit oxycodone pills containing deadly fentanyl that caused the overdose death of a La Jolla resident in June of 2018. Lucas, a resident of Highland, California, pleaded guilty in June 2019 to distribution of fentanyl resulting in death. In his plea, he admitted that he posted online advertisements for the illegal sale of prescription pills. The investigation revealed that Lucas was warned about the danger of the pills he was selling on t wo separate occasions. In late 2017, Lucas was warned that the pills he was selling were counterfeit and contained fentanyl that was much stronger than oxycodone pills. Then, just two months prior to the victim's death in mid -2018, Lucas was explicitly war ned that counterfeit pills containing fentanyl had caused the overdose of a San Diego resident. Lucas continued to sell the counterfeit pills. According to Lucas' plea General Service Adm inistration's Office of Inspector General, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Office of Inspector General, the Department of State's Office of International Intellectual Property Enforcement, the Arm y Criminal Investigation Command's Major Procurement Fraud Unit, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General, the Federal Maritime Commission, and the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspecto r General. 98 agreement, on the evening of June 29, 2018, Lucas met the victim and sold him nine \"blue s,\" a slang term for prescription oxycodone pills. The \"blues\" Lucas sold were counterfeit and contained fentanyl \u2014the same pills that Lucas had previously been warned about selling. The victim died after consuming the pills. Three other individuals were ch arged in the same indictment with conspiring with Lucas to distribute prescription hydrocodone pills; all three have since pleaded guilty and been sentenced. Large -Scale Counterfeit Fentanyl Pill Dealer Sentenced to 30 Years in Prison. On October 31, 2019, Dion Gregory Fisher was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison for money laundering and conspiracy to manufacture and distribute fentanyl and fentanyl analogue. Fisher was ordered to forfeit several high -end vehicles, and a forfeiture money order of nea rly $800,000 was entered against him. A federal jury had found Fisher guilty on June 5, 2019. Testimony and evidence presented during the seven -day trial showed that Fisher and others, including co -defendant Christopher McKinney, manufactured and distribut ed hundreds of thousands of counterfeit oxycodone 30 mg pills that were made with fentanyl that Fisher had ordered from China. The government admitted into evidence more than three kilograms of fentanyl and fentanyl analogue. On July 2, 2018, McKinney plea ded guilty to conspiring to distribute and manufacture fentanyl and fentanyl analogue, and he forfeited $1.4 million in cash, two residences, and several high- end vehicles and a motorcycle. Fisher and McKinney sold hundreds of thousands of counterfeit oxycodone pills, mostly via the U.S. Mail, to Phil Morose in Boston. Morose then distributed the pills. Morose was charged with conspiring to distribute and manufacture fentanyl and fentanyl analogue. He pleaded guilty to these charges and was sentenced on July 8, 2019, to 10 years in federal prison. East Bay Men Charged with Selling Counterfeit Pills Laced with Fentanyl. On December 12, 2019, Jose Ricardo Loza and Randy Lee Walker were arrested and charged with distributing fentanyl and heroin. When law enforcement agents arrested Loza, they found more than 2,000 counterfeit oxycodone pills hidden in hollowed out compartments of his furniture. An affidavit filed in the case alleges that Loza sold blue counterfeit oxycodone pills laced with fentanyl. According to the affidavit, Loza sold to a third party 50 fentanyl -laced pills on August 22, 2019, when at the auto body shop where he worked in Pittsburg, California. Loza allegedly did not initially have enough pills to sell, so he texted Walker, who arrived with more fentanyl -laced pills. During the transaction, Loza allegedly warned the customer to be careful because he (Loza) gave the same pills to a mutual friend who overdosed and died. The affidavit also alleges that on November 22, 2019, Loza sold 500 more c ounterfeit pills to an undercover officer and told the officer that he had 10,000 more of the same pills for sale, and on September 10, 2019, Loza sold two ounces of heroin. 99 Champaign Man Sentenced to 13 Years in Prison for Trafficking Millions of Counterfeit Xanax Pills on Darknet, Money Laundering. On January 6, 2020, Stephan Caamano, a Champaign, Ill., man, was sentenced to 13 years in federal prison for trafficking at least 4.3 million counterfeit Xanax pills throughout the country and laundering the proceeds. Caamano has been ordered to pay more than $2.1 million he gained in profits through this scheme and to serve a three- year term of supervised release upon completion of his prison sentence. On April 29, 2019, Caamano pleaded guilty to using darknet markets and cryptocurrency to traffic pills containing alprazolam, marked as 'Xanax,' from arch 2017 through May 2018. Caamano purchased controlled substances from abroad to make the counterfeit pills. The pills were manufactured to appear identical to prescription Xanax. Caamano then shipped the pills nationwide in quantities ranging from 1,000 pills per package up to one millio n. Philadelphia Man Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison for Trafficking Counterfeit Drugs that He Purchased on Dark Web with Bitcoin. On March 10, 2020, Michael Gordon, of Philadelphia, was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release, for conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The Court further ordered Gordon to pay over $2.7 million in restitution and to forfeit over $300,000. From approximately December 2017 until October 2018, Gordon was involved in a sophisticated scheme to obtain counterfeit Xanax on the dark web and to sell the counterfeit pills for a profit. He took numerous steps to conceal his illegal activity, such as having packages mailed to fictitious recipie nts at a variety of locations that Gordon himself controlled. Additionally, he paid for the counterfeit pills using Bitcoin, re -sold the counterfeit pills for a profit, and then laundered the proceeds of his illicit drug business to conceal the true nature of the funds. Before law enforcement stopped Gordon, he illegally obtained and redistributed hundreds of thousands of these counterfeit pills. He pleaded guilty to the charges in June 2019. Ukrainian Men Plead Guilty to Conspiracy and Trafficking Counte rfeit Cancer and Hepatitis Drugs. On July 17, 2020, two Ukrainian citizens admitted to conspiring to smuggle and distribute counterfeit cancer and hepatitis drugs into the United States. Maksym Nienadov, the owner of the Ukrainian- based company Healthy Nat ion, and his co- conspirator and employee, Volodymyr Nikolaienko, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, trafficking in counterfeit drugs, and smuggling goods into the United States. Nienadov also admitted to introducing misbranded medicine into the United States. N either Nienadov nor Nikolaienko are medical doctors, pharmacists, or licensed pharmaceutical wholesalers in the U.S. and neither had authorization to sell the drugs. Beginning in June 2018, undercover U.S. authorities began communicating with the two men a nd facilitating undercover purchases. Nienadov and Nikolaienko were taken into custody on April 18, 2019, after they arrived in the U.S from Ukraine to discuss future unlawful shipments of pharmaceuticals. 100 Manufacturing Broker Pleads Guilty in Conspiracy to Manufacture and Sell Counterfeit Goods. On August 25, 2020, Bernard Klein, a New York businessman, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and admitted that he conspired with New York wholesaler Ramin Kohanbash, 50, and at least one other person, to arrange the mass production of goods in China and Pakistan that carried counterfeit markings and labels identical to genuine trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Some of th e counterfeit items were distributed to members of the United States military. Klein facilitated the manufacturing of goods that contained the counterfeit markings. According to information presented to the court, Klein and Kohanbash instructed the manufac turers on how to fold and package the counterfeit goods, and to affix removable \"Made in China\" stickers to avoid problems when U.S. Customs inspected shipments. On June 13, 2019, Kohanbash pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and trafficking in counterfeit goods, and he admitted that among the items he and others arranged to counterfeit were 200 military parkas of a type used by U.S. Air Force personnel stationed in Afghanistan. These parkas were falsely represented to be genuine Multicam\u00ae, a fabric which incorporates specialized near -infrared management technology designed to make the wearer more difficult to detect with equipment such as night -vision goggles. Husband and Wife Plead Guilty to Naturalization Fraud and Conspiring to Illegally Im port and Distribute Male -Enhancement Products and Counterfeit Goods from China. On September 24, 2020, Irfanali Momin and Shiba I. Momin a/k/a Saguftabanu Momin, husband and wife, each pleaded guilty to naturalization fraud, and conspiring to illegally import misbranded drug products from China, receive misbranded drugs that had moved in interstate commerce, and to trafficking of counterfeit goods. According to the prosecution, the charges, and other information presented in court, between August 2014 and N ovember 2018, the Momins ordered and sold male - enhancement products from China marketed under names such as \"Black Ant King,\" \"Bull,\" \"Rhino 7,\" and \"Black Mamba.\" These products contained sildenafil, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viagra, and/or tadalafil, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Cialis. Both Viagra and Cialis can be obtained in the U.S. only with a prescription from a doctor. The Momins admitted to selling between $550,000 and $1.5 million in illegal drug products over the course of the conspiracy. They also sold various counterfeit goods from their warehouse in Dalton, Georgia, including counterfeit designer watches, headphones, e -cigarette devices, and tobacco rolling papers. (2) Protecting American Business from Commercial and Stat e-Sponsored Trade Secret Theft In FY 2020, Department prosecutors and the FBI have continued to emphasize the investigation and prosecution of commercial and state -sponsored trade secret theft. This continuing focus has led to the investigation and prosecution of numerous trade secret thefts and economic espionage cases. Recent cases include: 101 Chinese National Who Worked at Monsanto Indicted on Economic Espionage Charges. On November 21, 2019, Haitao Xiang, formerly of Chesterfield, Missouri, was indi cted by a federal grand jury on one count of conspiracy to commit economic espionage, three counts of economic espionage, one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, and three counts of theft of trade secrets. According to the indictment, Xia ng was employed by Monsanto and its subsidiary, The Climate Corporation, from 2008 to 2017, where he worked as an imaging scientist. Monsanto and The Climate Corporation developed a digital, on- line farming software platform that was used by farmers to col lect, store, and visualize critical agricultural field data and increase and improve agricultural productivity for farmers. A critical component to the platform was a proprietary predictive algorithm referred to as the Nutrient Optimizer, which Monsanto and The Climate Corporation considered a valuable trade secret and their intellectual property. In June 2017, the day after leaving employment with Monsanto and The Climate Corporation, Xiang bought a one -way plane ticket to China. Before he could board his flight, federal officials intercepted Xiang at the airport and seized copies of the Nutrient Optimizer. Chinese Military Personnel Charged with Computer Fraud, Economic Espionage, and Wire Fraud for Hacking into Credit Reporting Agency Equifax. On Februar y 10, 2020, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging four members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army with hacking into the computer systems of the credit reporting agency Equifax and stealing Americans' personal data and Equifax's valuable trade secrets. The nine- count indictment alleges that Wu Zhiyong, Wang Qian, Xu Ke, and Liu Lei were members of the People's Liberation Army's 54th Research Institute, a component of the Chinese military. They allegedly conspired to hack into Equifax's computer networks, maintain unauthorized access to those computers, and steal sensitive, personally identifiable information of approximately 145 million American victims. According to the c harges, the defendants exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts Web Framework software used by Equifax's online dispute portal. They used this access to conduct reconnaissance of Equifax's online dispute portal and to obtain login credentials that could be used to further navigate Equifax's network. The defendants spent several weeks running queries to identify Equifax's database structure and searching for sensitive, personally identifiable information within Equifax's system. The conspirators ultima tely were able to download and exfiltrate the data from Equifax's network to computers outside the U.S. In total, the attackers obtained names, birth dates, and social security numbers for nearly half of all American citizens. The indictment also charges the defendants with stealing trade secret information, namely Equifax's data compilations and database designs. The defendants routed traffic through approximately 34 servers located in nearly 20 countries to obfuscate their true location, used encrypted communication channels within Equifax's network to blend in with normal network activity, and deleted compressed files and wiped log files on a daily basis in an effort to eliminate records of their activity. 102 Two Chinese Hackers Working with the Ministry of State Security Charged with Global Computer Intrusion Campaign Targeting Intellectual Property and Confidential Business Information, Including COVID -19 Research. On July 7, 2020, a federal grand jury in Washington returned an 11- count indictment charging Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi, both nationals and residents of China, with hacking into the computer systems of hundreds of victim companies, governments, non- governmental organizations, and individual dissidents, clergy, and democratic and human rights activi sts in the U.S. and abroad.

On August 31, 2020, Hao Zhang, of China, was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison and ordered to pay $476,835 in restitution following his conviction at trial on charges of economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, and conspiring to commit both offenses. Evidence submitted during the course of the four -day bench trial demonstrated that, from 2010 to 2015, Zhang conspired to and did steal trade secrets from two companies: Avago, a designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of analog, digital, mixed signal, and optoelectronics components and subsystems with a focus in semiconductor design and processing, headquartered in San Jose, California, and Singapore; and Skyworks, an innovator of high performance analog semiconductors headquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts. The district court found that Zhang intended to steal the trade secrets for the benefit of China. Evidence further showed that, in October 2006, Zhang and his c o-conspirators started a business in China to compete with Avago and Skyworks. Zhang and Wei Pang, one of 104 Zhang's co- conspirators, illicitly shared trade secrets with each other and with co-conspirators in China while they worked for the U.S. companies. Zhang and Pang then connected their venture to Tianjin University (\"TJU\") in China, an instrumentality of the Chinese government. By 2009, they left their work in the U.S. to relocate to China, following a plan laid out by TJU officials to form another compa ny, Novana, in the Cayman Islands. During that time, Zhang obtained patents in his own name using trade secret information stolen from Avago. Additional evidence demonstrated that Zhang engaged in economic espionage to help TJU and Zhang's Chinese company unfairly compete in the multi- billion dollar global market for cell phone RF filters. (3) Large -Scale Commercial Counterfeiting and Online Piracy The Department continues to pursue significant, large -scale piracy and counterfeiting operations. In FY 2020, the Department has had a number of si gnificant prosecutions, including those set forth below: Federal Jury Convicts Former Video Store Owner of Selling Counterfeit DVDs. On October 29, 2019, Douglas Gordon was convicted of mail fraud and two counts of copyright infringement following a seven- day jury trial. According to evidence presented at trial, Gordon, the former owner of a chain of video rental stores in eastern Maine, operated three websites from which he made more than $640,000 from sales of over 48,000 counterfeit copies of copyright -protected motion pictures. Representatives of MGM, CBS, Disney, Mercury Pictures, and other copyright owners testified that Gordon did not have permission to reproduce and distribute the movies. A senior investigator employed by the Motion Picture Association identified the DVDs as counterfeit. Based on undercover purchases made from the three websites, execution of search warrants, and forensic analysis of computers, investigators from ICE -HSI identified Gordon as the operator of the online businesses. A series of customers testified at trial that they expected, based on website advertisements, to receive authorized DVD movies with cover art and a plastic case but instead received a paper envelope with nothing more than a burned disc with a laser -etched movie title. Several of Gordon's former video store employees also provided evidence of his unlawful reproduction. Newport Man Pleads Guilty to Copyright Infringement for Creating Illegal Video Streaming and Downloading Websites. On November 25, 2019, Talon White, of Newport, Oregon, pleaded guilty to one count each of criminal copyright infringement and tax evasion.

According to the indictment and other court documents, from September 2017 through December 2019, Thompson Jr. and Zhang allegedly sold counterfeit Vera Bradley handbags from e -commerce accounts to persons throughout the United States. Thompson Jr., who is employed by the U.S. Department of State as an Information Programs Officer at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, used his State Department computer to create accounts on a variety of e - commerce platforms, all from within a secure space within the Embassy. Once Thompson Jr. created these accounts, Zhang took primary responsibility for operating the accounts, communicating with customers, and procuring merchandise to be stored in the D istrict of Oregon. Thompson Jr. and Zhang also directed a co -conspirator in the District of Oregon to ship items to purchasers across the United States. Two New York Men, Members of Counterfeiting Ring, Sentenced to Years in Prison for Trafficking Fake Super Bowl and Other Game and Concert Tickets. On February 28, 2020, Damon Daniels, of Bronx, New York, was sentenced to 24 months in federal prison and thr ee years of supervised release for his participation in a conspiracy to produce and sell counterfeit tickets to sporting events and concerts.

According to her plea agreement, from about August 2016 until approximately April 2019, Xu conspired with others to import and sell counterfeit consumer goods, specifically Pandora jewelry and Ray- Ban sunglasses. Xu used her residence and offices in El Monte and Alhambra, California, as destination points for shipments of counterfeit goods shipped from Hong K ong and China. Xu repackaged the counterfeit goods, then mailed them to unsuspecting customers throughout the U.S. who believed they had purchased authentic goods. Xu and other members of the conspiracy obtained funds from the victims of the counterfeit sc heme through fraudulently acquired customer accounts opened in the names of other people at a global online payment company. The online payment company sent the victims' money to Xu by electronic transfer to bank accounts or by check, which Xu cashed at AT Ms or deposited into bank accounts opened by co- conspirators. Xu admitted that, as a result of her fraudulent conduct and her knowledge of the fraudulent conduct of her co- conspirators, she sold $2,322,845 worth of counterfeit Pandora and Ray- Ban- branded products to unsuspecting customers, causing a loss to the customers of at least that amount. On April 24, 2019, Xu and Yiwen Zhu, a Chinese citizen and legal permanent resident of the U.S., were arrested and indicted on federal charges of conspiracy, mail fraud, and trafficking in counterfeit goods. Acting U.S. Attorney Announces Federal Charges and International Operation to Dismantle Online Piracy Group. On August 26, 2020, indictments were unsealed charging Umar Ahmad, George Bridi, and Jonatan Correa w ith copyright infringement. According to the indictments, from 2011 to the present, Ahmad, Bridi, Correa, and others known and unknown, were members of the Sparks Group, an international piracy group involved in illegally distributing movies and television shows on the Internet. The Sparks Group fraudulently obtained copyrighted DVDs and Blu- Ray discs from wholesale distributors in advance of their retail release date by, among other things, making various misrepresentations to the wholesale distributors co ncerning the reasons that they were obtaining the discs prior to the retail release date. Sparks Group members then used computers with specialized software to compromise the copyright protections on the discs, a process referred to as \"cracking\" or \"ripping,\" and to 107 reproduce and encode the content in a format that could be easily copied and disseminated over the Internet. They uploaded copies of the copyrighted content onto servers the Sparks Group contr olled, and other members further reproduced and disseminated the content on streaming websites, peer -to-peer networks, torrent networks, and other servers accessible to the public. The Sparks Group identified its reproductions by encoding the filenames of reproduced copyrighted content with distinctive tags, and also uploaded photographs of the discs in their original packaging to demonstrate that the reproduced content originated from authentic DVDs and Blu- Ray discs. Ahmad and Bridi arranged for discs to be delivered from distributors located in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and New Jersey to other members of the Sparks Group, including Correa, prior to their official release date. Ahmad, Bridi, and Correa then reproduced, and aided and abetted the reproduction of, these discs by using computer software that circumvented copyright protections on the discs and reproducing the copyrighted content for distribution on the Internet. The Sparks Group has caused tens of millions of dollars in losses to film production studios. Domestic Training During the past fiscal year, the Department provided a number of training programs for federal, state, and local prosecutors and agents investigating IP crimes.

As a world leader in efforts to combat criminal IP infringement, the Department actively seeks to develop training and technical assistance programs to assist other countries in effectively enforcing IP laws and reducing the trafficking of counterfeit and pirated goods. Despite constraints related to the COVID -19 pandemic, in FY 2020, the Department worked extensively with its law enforcement counterparts around the world. The Department sought to engage foreign law enforcement through meetings of officials, ranging from the Attorney General to line attorneys and agents. CCIPS and DOJ's Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (\"OPDAT\") worked with State Department grants and in cooperation with other United States agencies in FY 2020 to provide training to foreign officials on effective enforcem ent of IP laws. The Department's IP trainings are designed to increase cooperation between various law enforcement agencies with responsibility for IP offenses; to utilize various types of charges, including economic and organized crime statutes to combat IP crime; and to increase awareness amongst enforcement officials and the judiciary of the importance of reducing counterfeiting and piracy. In FY 2020, the Department, with assistance from the State Department, continued to expand the U.S. Transnational and High Tech Crime Global Law Enforcement Network(\"GLEN\") of International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (\"ICHIP\") attorneys (formerly, the Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordinator (\"IPLEC\") program). DOJ has now posted experienced p rosecutors in Bucharest, Romania; Hong Kong; S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; Abuja, Nigeria; Bangkok, Thailand; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and The Hague, Netherlands.

Those sites can be found a t https://www.justice.gov/iptf and https://www.cybercrime.gov. The IPR Center also has a website where the public can report IP theft. That site can be found at https://www.iprcenter.gov. Several years ago, NSD placed additional focus on the protection of national assets from the threats of nation states, including economic espionage and trade secret theft. These changes included creating a new Deputy Assistant Attorney General position focused on protecting national assets. Pursuant to this increased focus over the last s everal years, NSD leadership and other attorneys have reached out to senior managers and counsel at hundreds of companies over the last year to educate them about the Department's resources and efforts to combat economic espionage and trade secret theft an d other national security threats. These outreach efforts have included presentations at universities and think tanks, cybersecurity summits and roundtable discussions, as well as one -on-one meetings with senior executives at Fortune 500 and other companie s. The NSCS Network also has periodically disseminated talking points and other resources to its members nationwide to facilitate their outreach to companies and other organizations in their home districts and facilitated FBI field offices' efforts to educate AUSAs on the national security threats in their districts and to include them in FBI's outreach efforts in their districts. China Initiative On November 1, 2018, former Attorney General Sessions announced the Department - wide China Initiative to emphasize the Department's strategic priority of countering Chinese national security threats, consistent with the Administration's national security strategy. The Initiative Steering Committee is led by the Assistant Attorney General for National Security as the Chair of the Committee and also includes the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, five United States Attorneys, and the Executive Assistant Director of the FBI's National Security Branch. The goals of the Initiative are to: (1) id entify priority trade secret theft cases, ensuring that investigations are adequately resourced, and working to bring them to fruition in a timely manner and according to the facts and applicable law; (2) develop an enforcement strategy concerning non- traditional collectors (e.g., researchers in labs, universities, universities and the defense industrial base) that are being coopted into transferring technology contrary to U.S. interests; (3) educate colleges and universities about potential threats to acad emic freedom and open discourse from influence efforts on campus; (4) apply the Foreign Agents Registration Act to unregistered agents seeking to advance China's political agenda, bringing enforcement actions when appropriate; (5) equip the nation's U.S. A ttorneys with intelligence and materials they can use to raise awareness of these threats within their 124 Districts and support their outreach efforts; (6) implement the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) for DOJ (including by working w ith Treasury to develop regulations under the statute and prepare for increased workflow); (7) identify opportunities to better address supply chain threats, especially those impacting the telecommunications sector, prior to the transition to 5G networks; (8) identify Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) cases involving Chinese companies that compete with American businesses; (9) increase efforts to improve Chinese responses to requests under the Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement (MLAA) with the United Stat es; and (10) evaluate whether additional legislative and administrative authorities are required to protect our national assets from foreign economic aggression. (a)(7)(C) Investigative and Prosecution Activity of the Department with Respect to IP Crimes As the cases highlighted above show, the Department has sought to increase the quality and scope of its investigations and prosecutions over the past years. Numerical statistics do not adequately convey the quality or complexity of these prosecutions, but they provide some insight into the effectiveness and impact of the Department's prosecution efforts. Accordingly, we have provided the chart below that contains statistics for FY 2020, listing the number of defendants and cases charged, the number of de fendants sentenced, and the length of those sentences. 12 Section 404(b) of the PRO IP Act also requests statistics on the number of arrests made. Please see the FBI's Annual Report, provided pursuant to Section 404(c) of the PRO IP Act, for an accounting of arrest statistics. 12 Case statistics were compiled by the Executive Office for U.S. Attorney's (\"EOUSA\"). The chart includes data on crim inal cases/defendants where the following charges were brought as any charge against a defendant: 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 506 of motion 8 2320 (trafficking in counterfeit goods); and 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 553 & 605 (signal piracy). The statutes were grouped together to eliminate double counting of cases and/or defendants where more than one statute was charged against the same defendant. However, this chart may not include cases or defendants if only a conspiracy to violate one of these offenses was charged. 125 District Totals FY 2020 Investigative Matters Received by AUSAs 167 Defendants Charged 65 Cases Charged 37 Defendants Sentenced 41 No Prison Term 16 1-12 Months 11 13-24 Months 4 25-36 Months 0 37-60 Months 6 60 + Months 4 In addition, the chart below details FY 2020 statistics for criminal IP cases broken down by type of charge.13 Charge Cases charged Percentage Trademark Trafficking in counterfeit goods, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2320 23 61% Copyright Act Economic espionage, 18 U.S.C. 1831 Theft of trade secrets, 18 5% 16% Total 38 100% (a)(7)(D) Department -Wide Assessment of the Resources Devoted to Enforcement of IP Crimes The Criminal Division currently devotes 15 full -time attorneys, along with paralegals and support staff, in CCIPS to IP issues. CCIPS also provides substantial support to the IPR Center, assigning at least one attorney, and sometimes more, to help identify and de -conflict 13 EOUSA compiled the statistics for number of cases charged broken down by IP statute. These statistics may not reflect cases where o nly a conspiracy to violate one of these offenses was charged, and there may be double - counting of cases where more than one statute was charged in the same case. 126 investigative leads, as well as develop and execute national enforcement initiatives. The CHIP Network consists of AUSAs who are specially trained in the investigation and prosecution of IP and computer crimes. Every U.S. Attorney's Offic e has at least one CHIP attorney, and those districts that have historically faced the highest concentration of IP and high- tech crimes tend to have multiple CHIP attorneys. Over the last year, more than 20 NSD attorneys have worked on hacking investigat ions (most of which involve the theft of information, including but not limited to trade secrets) and economic espionage investigations. As described above, the NSCS Network consists of more than 100 AUSAs and attorneys at Department headquarters who recei ve specialized annual training in the investigation and prosecution of national security cyber offenses, including the theft of IP and other information. Under the ICHIP program (formerly known as the IPLEC program), DOJ has had a Department attorney stat ioned in Bangkok, Thailand, since January 2006 to handle IP issues in Asia. Between November 2007 and March 2011, a separate DOJ attorney was stationed in Sofia, Bulgaria, in order to handle IP issues in Eastern Europe. While funding for this position expi red in 2011, DOJ worked with the Department of State to post a DOJ attorney in Bucharest, Romania, beginning in 2015 to continue to handle IP issues in that region. DOJ also expanded its ICHIP program in FY 2015 by placing a DOJ attorney in Brasilia, Brazi l, for a six -month term. With the assistance of the State Department, DOJ expanded the ICHIP program in FY 2016 by posting new regional ICHIPs in Hong Kong and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. In FY 2017, the State Department and DOJ prepared to field a new ICHIP positi on in Abuja, Nigeria, which was deployed in October 2017. In FY 2019, the State Department and DOJ added new regional ICHIP positions in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and The Hague, Netherlands, and two new ICHIP Advisors based in Washington, D.C. who have globa l subject matter expertise in dark web and cryptocurrency issues and internet -based fraud and public health issues, respectively. A Global Cyber Forensic Advisor is also based in Washington, D.C. In FY 2020, the ICHIP Network expanded to include regional I CHIPs in Panama City, Panama; Zagreb, Croatia; and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. 12 ICHIP attorneys now serve in the Network, plus one Global Cyber Forensic Advisor. In addition to evaluating digital evidence, the CCIPS Cybercrime Lab technicians have provided e xtensive training on the use of digital forensics tools in IP cases to law enforcement audiences around the world. IP enforcement is also an integral part of the mission of four sections of the Department's Civil Division: the Intellectual Property Section, the National Courts Section, the Consumer Protection Branch, and the Civil Appellate Staff. Through the Civil Div ision's Intellectual Property Section, the Department brings affirmative cases when the United States' IP is infringed, including Uniform Domain- Name Dispute- Resolution Policy proceedings where domain owners have used trademarks owned by the United States in a manner that is likely to confuse the public. The National Courts Section initiates civil actions to recover various penalties or customs duties arising from negligent or fraudulent import transactions, many of which include importation of counterfeit goods. The National Courts Section also defends 127 CBP enforcement of the ITC's Section 337 exclusion orders at the Court of International Trade; these orders are an important tool for patent enforcement. The Consumer Protection Branch conducts civil and crim inal litigation under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including prosecuting counterfeit drug and medical device offenses and assisting AUSAs throughout the country with their counterfeit pharmaceutical and device cases. Finally, the Civil Appellate Staff represents the United States in copyright and trademark cases in the courts of appeals, including participating as an amicus or intervenor in private IP litigation involving important government interests and defending decisions of the Copyright Office and the USPTO against constitutional and statutory challenges. (a)(8) Efforts to Increase Efficiency The Department works hard to ensure the effective use of limited resources devoted to fighting IP crime. One of the most important ways to reduce duplication of effort is to ensure that law enforcement agencies are pursuing unique case leads, and that prosecutors are not following prosecution strategies that duplicate t hose in other districts. To that end, CCIPS continues to provide ongoing support to the IPR Center in Arlington, Virginia. Among other things, the IPR Center serves as an investigation clearinghouse for FBI, ICE -HSI, CBP, FDA, and other agencies. CCIPS als o works closely with the CHIP Network to assist in coordinating national prosecution initiatives. Along similar lines, NSD works closely with the NSCS Network to assist in coordinating national prosecution initiatives designed to counter the national secur ity cyber threat. Department attorneys will continue to work with the IPR Center and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force to identify and de - conflict investigative leads, as well as assist the CHIP and NSCS Networks to ensure that investigatio ns and prosecutions are streamlined, not duplicated, and that charges are brought in the appropriate venue. * * * \"(8) A summary of the efforts, activities, and resources that the Department of Justice has taken to \u2014 (A) minimize duplicating the efforts, materials, facilities, and procedures of any other Federal agency responsible for the enforcement, investigation, or prosecution of intellectual property crimes; and (B) enhance the efficiency and consistency with which Federal funds and resources are expended to enforce, investigate, or prosecute intellectual property crimes, including the extent to which the Department has utilized existing personnel, materials, technologies, and facilities.\" 128 II. The following is a discussion of Department of Justice (DOJ) activities relating to intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement, including litigation activities in which arrests, charges, indictments, guilty pleas or verdicts, and/or sentencing took place during FY 2021. In addition to the litigation activities discussed below, DOJ also engages in IP protection and enforcement through other activities, many of which involve collaboration with other Federal agencies. Examples of these interagency collaborations during FY 2021 are discussed in the other appendices to this report. For example, the appendix for the State Department discusses the Global Law Enforcement Network (GLEN) of DOJ attorneys - known as International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (ICHIP) advisors - who are posted around the world and are primar ily funded by the State Department. The ICHIPs train and mentor their foreign law enforcement counterparts; collaborate with USG offices in the region (e.g., US embassy staff, IP Counselors and Attach\u00e9s, HSI Attach\u00e9s, and FDA and CBP personnel); and engage with IP rightsholders and other non-governmental stakeholders. The FY 2021 activities of the various ICHIPS are discussed elsewhere in this report, including in the appendices for the Department of Commerce, Homeland Security, and State.

On September 22, 2021, Bill Omar Carrasquillo of Swedesboro, NJ; Jesse Gonzales of Pico Rivera, CA; and Michael Barone of Richmond Hill, NY, were charged by Indictment with crimes arising out of a wide -ranging and lucrative copyright infringement scheme. According to the Indictment, from about March 2016 until at least November 2019, the defendants operated a large- scale internet protocol television (IPTV) theft scheme in which they fraudulently obtained cable television accounts and then resold copyrighted content to thousands of their own subscribers, who could then stream or playback content. The defendants also allegedly made fraudulent misrepresentations to banks and merchant processors in an effort to obtain merchant processing accounts. During the period of their scheme, the defendants earned more than $30 million. Carrasquillo, in particular, allegedly converted a large portion of his profits into homes and dozens of vehicles, including high- end sports cars.

On September 15, 2021, Michael Calabria, Joseph Keegan, and Casey Silver pleaded guilty to criminal copyright infringement. Calabria and Keegan were principals of Cons tructure Technologies, LLC (\"Constructure\"), located in Melville, New York, and Silver was a Constructure employee. The charge relates to the 129 defendants' installing unlicensed versions of software by using \"cracking\" programs or \"key generators,\" which al lowed Constructure employees to activate copies of the software without paying for a license and obtaining a key. In addition to the guilty pleas, Constructure itself was charged with a felony violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\") and agreed to pay a $60,000 fine. According to court filings, Constructure provided information technology services, helping install, manage and service various networks and other technology products for small and medium sized businesses. Calabria was Con structure's President, Keegan was the Chief Technology Officer, and Silver was a Project Manager. Between 2011 and 2018, Constructure sold, installed and provided services for computer programs that were copyrighted and then sold by software companies (\"V ictim Software Companies\"), including VMWare, a global cloud computing software company. Some of those computer programs were designed so that they could not be activated until a user paid the company for a \"license\" to use that software. In purchasing a license, the user received a \"key\"\u2014a string of letters, numbers and symbols \u2014that, when entered into the copy of software obtained by the user, activated the software. Constructure's clients generally paid Constructure to purchase licenses for such comput er programs and to activate those programs with a legitimate license key. Starting in or about 2011, Calabria, Keegan, and Silver helped to operate Constructure's business in part by installing unlicensed versions of software from Victim Software Companie s by using cracking programs or key generators, which allowed Constructure to activate copies of the software without paying for a license and obtaining a key. Constructure employees, often at the express direction of Calabria or Keegan, used cracking programs or key generators to install software from multiple Victim Software Companies. Constructure employees, including Keegan, obtained license keys and cracking programs from the internet. They also tested those programs on a computer server located in the basement of Constructure's office in Melville and on a file- sharing site controlled by Constructure, so that the programs could be used remotely by Constructure employees. By installing working, but unlicensed, versions of software, Constructure was able to bill a customer for the software, under the pretense that Constructure purchased a copy on behalf of the customer, while not actually paying for it. Constructure employees did not inform Constructure's clients or the Victim Software Companies that Constructure employees used \"cracks\" to install those programs. From approximately 2011 to approximately 2018, Constructure employees installed cracked software programs for multiple clients, including clients located in Hicksville, New York; Mineola, New York; Manhattan, New York; and Bridgewater, New Jersey. (EDNY, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Announces Extradition Of British National For Participation In Online Film And TV Piracy Group. On August 31, 2021, George Bridi, a citizen of the United Kingdom, was extradited to the United States from Cyprus. Bridi was arrested on August 23, 2020, in Paphos, Cyprus, and was extradited on charges of conspiracy to commit 130 copyright infringement, wire fraud conspiracy, and conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property, for his involvement in the Sparks Group, an international piracy group that illegally distributed movies and television shows on the internet. On August 26, 2020, the indictments were unsealed charging Umar Ahmad, George Bridi, and Jonatan Correa with copyright infringement. Bridi's indictment also included wire fraud for involvement in the Sparks Group, an international piracy group involved in illegally distributing movies and television shows on t he internet, and conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate. Co-defendant Jonatan Correa, a/k/a \"Raid,\" previously pled guilty to conspiracy to commit copyright infringement and was sentenced on May 19, 2021, to three years and three months of supervised release, with the first three months to be served in community confinement. Co -defendant Umar Ahmad, a citizen of Norway, remains at large. According to the allegations contained in the Indictments, from 2011 onward, Ahmad, Bridi, Correa, and others known and unknown, were members of the Sparks Group. In furtherance of its scheme, the Sparks Group fraudulently obtained copyrighted DVDs and Blu- Ray discs from wholesale distributors in advance of their retail release date by, among other things, making various misrepresentations to the wholesale distributors concerning the reasons that they were obtaining the discs prior to the retail release date. Sparks Group members then used computers with specialized software to compromise the copyright protec tions on the discs, a process referred to as \"cracking\" or \"ripping,\" and to reproduce and encode the content in a format that could be easily copied and disseminated over the internet. They thereafter uploaded copies of the copyrighted content onto serve rs controlled by the Sparks Group, where other members further reproduced and disseminated the content on streaming websites, peer -to-peer networks, torrent networks, and other servers accessible to the public. The Sparks Group identified its reproductions by encoding the filenames of reproduced copyrighted content with distinctive tags, and also uploaded photographs of the discs in their original packaging to demonstrate that the reproduced content originated from authentic DVDs and Blu -Ray discs. Ahmad and Bridi arranged for discs to be picked up, mailed, or delivered from distributors located in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and New Jersey to other members of the Sparks Group, including Correa, prior to their official release date. Ahmad, Bridi, and Corre a then reproduced, and aided and abetted the reproduction of, these discs by using computer software that circumvented copyright protections on the discs and reproducing the copyrighted content for further distribution on the internet.

Some of the confidential documents stolen from Genentech and obtained by Jordanov and Lin allegedly contained trade secrets. 138 The indictment alleges that, starting in 2009, Lin recruited an experienced and acc omplished scientist then working at Genentech and her husband to work as a team to purloin confidential information from within Genentech. Beginning in 2013, Lin and Jordanov allegedly used confidential information from the husband and wife team and other sources to help JHL Biotech cut corners, reduce costs, solve problems, save time, and otherwise accelerate product development timelines, secretly using Genentech's high -quality, confidential, intellectual property. In 2014, Jordanov and Lin supervised a nd managed a so- called \"conversion\" project whereby JHL employees converted confidential Genentech standard operating procedures or \"SOPs\" into JHL Biotech SOPs. For example, JHL employees engaged in the wholesale cutting and pasting of logos from the confidential documents by simply cutting out Genentech logos and pasting in JHL Biotech logos to make the Genentech SOPs appear, falsely, to be JHL Biotech SOPs. JHL Biotech employees allegedly drafted approximately ninety (90) different SOPs using Genentech documents, many of which were confidential and proprietary. JHL Biotech employees maintained a spreadsheet in which they identified Genentech SOPs that JHL Biotech possessed and tracked the progress to convert these into JHL Biotech SOPs. The widespread use of the stolen Genentech SOPs allegedly saved JHL Biotech thousands of dollars. To profit from the trove of stolen confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information, Jordanov and Lin, according to the indictment, then carried out a scheme to def raud JHL Biotech's potential investors and strategic partners. To induce investment, and obtain money for JHL Biotech and themselves, Jordanov and Lin allegedly defrauded investors by concealing the extent to which JHL Biotech used stolen intellectual property to start, accelerate, and conduct its business. The indictment alleges that, in late 2016, JHL Biotech entered a strategic partnership with Sanofi S.A., a French multinational pharmaceutical company headquartered in Paris, France, to manufacture and distribute biosimilars in China. As part of the agreement, in December 2016, Sanofi allegedly paid $101 million to JHL Biotech, using foreign and interstate wires to carry out the corporate transaction. This cash payment allegedly was part of a strategi c relationship worth potentially $337 million to JHL Biotech. To induce Sanofi's payment of $101 million in cash, Jordanov allegedly signed representations and warranties that falsely stated that JHL Biotech's knowledge, research, development, use, and ma nufacture of certain biosimilars had been conducted without infringing or misappropriating intellectual property from any third party. Jordanov also allegedly made false and misleading statements about consultants used by JHL Biotech and otherwise conceal ed from Sanofi the secret work of the Genentech insider for JHL Biotech. In 2019, following the public disclosure of some of the alleged criminal conduct, the value of JHL Biotech, once as high as approximately $916 million, allegedly crashed.

On August 10, 2021, Kathleen M. Jasper and Jeremy M. Jasper, both of Estero, Florida, pled guilty to racketeering (RICO) conspiracy and conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets. Court documents reflect that , since January 2016, the Jaspers, who are both certified Florida teachers, stole content and conspired with others to steal content from the Florida Teacher Certification Exams (FTCE) and the Florida Educational Leadership Exam (FELE) and included the stolen content in the test preparation materials and services that were sold through their business, NavaEd, LLC (\"NavaEd\"), for personal profit. NavaEd, LLC, was a company that offered tutoring and training to prepare prospective Florida educators to successfully take and pass the FTCE and the FELE, which are required for certification in the state of Florida. NavaEd offered training publications for sale worldwide directly through its website and through third- party e -commerce websites, such as Amazon and S hopify. Both Kathleen and Jeremy Jasper took the FTCE and FELE multiple times - after having already passed the exams - in order see and memorize, or harvest, as many different exam questions as possible. The Jaspers also directed NavaEd employees and ind ependent contractors to take the FTCE and FELE for the purpose of harvesting exam questions and answers. The Jaspers and NavaEd customers shared the stolen FTCE and FELE test content with each other through email, phone, video conferencing, and messaging applications. The Jaspers republished the stolen FTCE and FELE test content - verbatim and almost verbatim - into NavaEd publications that were written to prepare future Florida teachers and school administrators for the certification exams.

On May 26, 2021, the government filed a one -count Superseding Information charging Decker with conspiracy to steal, downlo ad, and possess trade secrets. According to the Superseding Information, Decker was a controller for the valve division of an oil and gas company that serves customers engaged in drilling and production. With its valve operations headquartered in Oklahom a City, the company manufactures compact manifold ball valves sold across the United States. In March 2017, while employed as the controller at the company, Decker registered with the Oklahoma Secretary of State a new company called Legacy Valve Systems ( \"Legacy\"). He then recruited co -workers at the victim company to join him at Legacy. The Superseding Information alleges that from March to September 2017, Decker conspired to steal numerous trade secrets from the victim company. Specifically, it allege s that Decker and others acting at his direction downloaded the technical drawings, material specifications, and manufacturing instructions for the victim company's valves, and Decker transmitted the victim company's detailed financial information - includ ing cost information and sales by product and customer - by email to himself. The Superseding Information further alleges that Decker provided the victim company's drawings to an individual who copied them and replaced the victim company's logo with a Legacy logo to begin manufacturing and selling valves to compete with the 140 victim company. Decker then allegedly directed others to delete all their text messages and files, including messages on an encrypted application, to conceal their theft from the victi m company. At the June 2 hearing, Decker pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal trade secrets. He admitted that the victim company undertook several measures to protect their information as trade secrets. Decker admitted that he, along with others, planned to take and use the drawings of the victim company's valves to create products for Legacy. He also admitted that he possessed many of the drawings on his own laptop and that he instructed those working with him to delete their communications about the drawings they took.

On May 24, 2021, Peter James Cariani of Boston, MA, pleaded guilty to attempting to steal trade secrets belonging to his employer, a Nevada -based defense contractor. According to court documents and admissions made in court, Cariani was employed as a systems engineer by Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC). On April 7, 2015, without authority to do so, Cariani downloaded tens of thousands of electronic files from SNC's computer net work. The files contained trade secret information related to SNC's Radar Enhanced Vision System: a unique onboard aircraft radar sensing system that displays digital images of the ground for pilots flying in zero- visibility conditions. Cariani transferred the files to a personal external hard drive, and later transmitted information derived from the files to others for potential economic benefit. When entering his guilty plea, Cariani admitted that he knowingly downloaded trade secret information from SNC' s network and he knew his actions would harm SNC. An investigation was initiated by the FBI's Reno branch after SNC detected (and reported) that an unauthorized electronic device had been used to download files from its computer network.

As part of his guilty plea, Sui admitted that between about January 1, 2015 and December 21, 2017, he stole multiple electronic files that contained GE's trade secrets related to the research, development, design and manufacture of its silicon carbide metal -oxide semiconductor field- effect transistors (MOSFETs), which are used in a variety of GE's parts and products, including aviation equipment and wind Businessman Charged With Conspiring To Steal Trade Secrets. On February 25, 2021, Chi Lung Winsman Ng, aka Winsman Ng, a Chinese businessman residing in Hong Kong, was indicted for conspiring to steal General Electric's (GE) trade secrets involving the company's silicon carbide MOSFET technology worth millions of dollars. The indictment 141 alleges that, between about March 2017 and January 2018, Ng and at least one co- conspirator plotted to develop a business that would manufacture and sell silicon carbide MOSFETs using trade secrets stolen from GE. Ng conspired with at least one other person, a GE engineer of more than seven years, to steal MOSFET trade secrets and other proprietary information from GE. Ng and co- conspirator #1 allegedly used those trade secrets to create a business plan and develop PowerPoint presentations which they gave to prospective investors. Ng a nd co- conspirator #1 told potential investors that their business could be profitable within three years and that their start -up business possessed assets - tangible and intangible - they estimated to be worth $100 million. As part of the scheme, they soug ht approximately $30 million in funding in exchange for an ownership stake in their start -up company. In August 2017, Ng and co- conspirator #1 allegedly met in China and gave presentations to a Chinese investment company that was considering providing funding to Ng's start -up company.

On April 22, 2021, following a twelve -day jury trial, Dr. Xiaorong You, aka Shannon You, of Lansing, Michigan, was c onvicted of conspiracy to commit trade secret theft, conspiracy to commit economic espionage, possession of stolen trade secrets, economic espionage, and wire fraud. You and Liu Xiangchen, of Shandong Province, China, were originally indicted in February 2 019 for trade secret offenses and wire fraud, and You was charged in a superseding indictment with economic espionage and conspiracy to commit economic espionage in August 2020, for conspiracy to steal trade secrets related to formulations for bisphenol -A-free (BPA -free) coatings. You was also indicted on seven counts of theft of trade secrets and one count of wire fraud. The BPA -free trade secrets allegedly stolen by these individuals belonged to multiple owners and cost an estimated total of at least $1 19,600,000 to develop. Until recently, bisphenol -A (BPA) was used to coat the inside of cans and other food and beverage containers to help minimize flavor loss, and prevent the container from corroding or reacting with the food or beverage contained therein. However, due to the discovery of potential harmful effects of BPA, companies began searching for BPA -free alternatives. These alternatives are difficult and expensive to develop. From December 2012 through August 31, 2017, You was employed as Pri ncipal Engineer for Global Research by a company in Atlanta, which had agreements with numerous companies to conduct research and development, testing, analysis and review of various BPA -free technologies. Due to her extensive education and experience wit h BPA and BPA- free coating technologies, she was one of a limited number of employees with access to trade secrets belonging to the various owners. From approximately September 2017 through June 2018, You was employed as a packaging application development manager for a company in Kingsport, Tennessee, where she was one of a limited number of employees with access to trade secrets belonging to that company. The indictment alleges that You, Liu, and a third co- conspirator formulated a plan in which You w ould exploit her employment with the two American employers to steal trade secrets and provide the information, for the economic benefit of trade secrets, to the Chinese 142 company that Liu managed, which would manufacture and profit from products developed using the stolen trade secrets. In exchange, Liu would cause the Chinese company to reward You for her theft, by helping her receive the Thousand Talent and another financial award, based on the trade secrets she stole, and by giving You an ownership share of a new company that would \"own\" the stolen trade secrets in China. The conspirators also agreed to compete with U.S. and foreign companies, including some of the owners of the stolen trade secrets, in China and elsewhere, by selling products designed, developed and manufactured using the stolen trade secrets. -secrets Hospital Researcher Sentenced to Prison for Conspiring to Steal Trade Secrets and Sell to China.

On October 29, 2020, a federal grand jury returned an indictment alleging corporate entities conspired to steal technology from a Houston- area oil & gas manufacturer. Jason Energy Technologies Co. (JET) in Yantai, People's Republic of China; Jason Oil and Gas Equipment LLC (JOG) USA; and Chinese national Lei Gao, aka Jason Gao, are charged with conspiracy, theft of trade secrets and attempted theft of trade secrets. Also charged in relation to the case is Robert Erford Jr. of Dayton, Texas, who worked for a Houston- area company and previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit trade secrets. On or about November 7, 2019, Gao allegedly met with Erford at the JOG offices located in Houston. According to the indictment, Erford signed a consultancy agreement that Gao provided at that time, indicating Erford would work in China as a consultant to assist JOG in coiled tubing technology. At that meeting, Erfor d was also provided a letter from the JET general manager inviting him to visit in order to have a technical exchange and discussion, according to the charges. That letter allegedly indicated a goal of helping to promote the company's manufacturing efficie ncy, reduce machine failure, and increase production capacity. Without authorization, on or about November 22, 2019, Erford allegedly transferred a victim company document that contained a trade secret from the U.S. to China for JET's benefit. The indictm ent further alleges that from approximately November 25- 29, 2019, Erford held meetings with Gao and JET officials at JET's offices in China and its coiled tubing facilities. At those meetings, they allegedly discussed coiled tubing technology, including vi ctim company proprietary technology, practices and procedures.

On October 28, 2020, United Microelectronics Corporation, Inc. (UMC), a Taiwan semiconductor foundry, pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret theft and was sentenced to pay a $60 million fine, in exchange for its agreement to cooperate with the government in the investigation and prosecution of its co- defendant, a Chinese state- owned - enterprise. A federal grand jury in dicted UMC in September 2018, along with Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., Ltd. (Fujian Jinhua), a state -owned enterprise of the People's Republic of China (PRC), and three individuals for conspiracy to steal, convey, and possess stolen trade secrets o f an American semiconductor company (Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron)) for the benefit of a state -owned enterprise of the PRC (Fujian Jinhua). As a result of the guilty plea, and in accordance with an accompanying plea agreement, UMC, whose American Depository Receipts are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, will pay the fine (the second largest ever in a criminal trade secret prosecution), be subject to a three -year term of probation, and cooperate with the United States. UMC pleaded guilty t o a superseding information charging the company with one count of criminal trade secret theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1832(a)(3). The other criminal charges and a parallel civil suit by the United States against UMC will be dismissed. The criminal prosecution of Fujian Jinhua and the three individual defendants will continue, as will a civil 145 action seeking to enjoin Fujian Jinhua from the further transfer of stolen trade secrets and the export to the U.S. of products manufactured by Fujian Jinhua that were made using the stolen trade secrets. According to the facts admitted in connection with the guilty plea, UMC hired the three individual defendants - Chen Zhengkun, a.k.a. Stephen Chen; He Jianting, a.k.a. J.T. Ho; and Wang Yungming, a.k.a. Kenny Wang - from Micron's Taiwan subsidiary. UMC made Chen a senior vice president and assigned him to lead negotiation of an agreement with Fujian Jinhua to develop Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) technology for Fujian Jinhua. As a foundry company, UMC previously made logic chips designed by other companies but did not make DRAM memory chips. Chen hired Ho and Wang to join the DRAM development team, and Ho and Wang brought Micron's confidential information to UMC from Micron's Taiwan subsidiary. After UMC's Inf ormation Technology Department found Micron's intellectual property on Ho's UMC computer, Chen approved the issuance of two \"off network\" laptop computers that allowed UMC employees to access Micron confidential information without further detection by UMC 's IT department. In particular, Wang used one file containing Micron's trade secrets to adjust UMC's design rules for the memory in question. Later, when Taiwan authorities searched UMC's offices, Ho and Wang asked another UMC employee to hide papers, not es, USB drives, a personal phone, and a laptop computer while the Taiwan authorities executed their search warrants. Taiwan authorities recovered only one of the two off -network laptops. The hard drive of the other was reformatted and concealed from Taiwan authorities. Beginning in the month of the Taiwan raids, Chen became president of Fujian Jinhua and took charge of its memory production facility.

(DMA, HSI, FBI, NCIS, U.S.C. \u00a7 1831) Four Chinese Nationals Working with the Ministry of State Security Charged with Global Computer Intrusion Campaign Targeting Intellectual Property and Confidential Business Information, Including Infectious Disease Research. On May 28, 2021, four nationals and residents of the People's Republic of China were cha rged with a campaign to hack into the computer systems of dozens of victim companies, universities and government entities in the United States and abroad between 2011 and 2018. The indictment, which was unsealed on July 16, 2021, alleges that much of the conspiracy's theft was focused on information that was of significant economic benefit to China's companies and commercial sectors, including information that would allow the circumvention of lengthy and resource -intensive research and development processe s. The defendants and their Hainan State Security Department (HSSD) conspirators sought to obfuscate the Chinese government's role in such theft by establishing a front company, Hainan Xiandun Technology Development Co., Ltd. (Hainan Xiandun), since disbanded, to operate out of Haikou, Hainan Province. The two- count indictment alleges that Ding Xiaoyang, Cheng Qingmin and Zhu Yunmin, were HSSD officers responsible for coordinating, facilitating, and managing computer hackers and linguists at Hainan Xiandun and other China Ministry of State Security (MSS) front companies to conduct hacking for the benefit of China and its state -owned and sponsored instrumentalities. The indictment alleges that Wu Shurong was a computer hacker who, as part of his job duties a t Hainan Xiandun, created malware, hacked into computer systems operated by foreign governments, companies, and universities, and supervised other Hainan Xiandun hackers. The conspiracy's hacking campaign targeted victims across the world. Targeted indust ries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical, and maritime. Stolen trade secrets and confidential business information included sensitive technologies used for submersibles and autonomous vehicles, s pecialty 147 chemical formulas, commercial aircraft servicing, and foreign information to support China's efforts to secure contracts for state -owned enterprises within the targeted country (e.g., large - scale high -speed railway development projects). As alleged, the charged MSS Officers coordinated with staff and professors at various universities in Hainan and elsewhere in China to further the conspiracy's goals. Not only did such universities assist the MSS in identifying and recruiting hackers and linguist s to penetrate and steal from the computer networks of targeted entities, including peers at many foreign universities, but personnel at one identified Hainan- based university also helped support and manage Hainan Xiandun as a front company, including thro ugh payroll, benefits, and a mailing address. According to the indictment, to gain initial access to victim networks, the conspiracy sent fraudulent spearphishing emails that were buttressed by fictitious online profiles and contained links to doppelg\u00e4nger domain names, which were created to mimic or resemble the domains of legitimate companies. In some instances, the conspiracy used hijacked credentials, and the access they provided, to launch spearphishing campaigns against other users within the same victim entity or at other targeted entities. The conspiracy also used multiple and evolving sets of sophisticated malware, including both publicly available and customized malware, to obtain, expand and maintain unauthorized access to victim computers and networks. The conspiracy's malware included those identified by security researchers as BADFLICK, aka GreenCrash; PHOTO, aka Derusbi; RY, aka dp.dll. Such malware allowed for initial and continued intrusions into victim systems, lateral movement within a system, and theft of credentials, including administrator passwords. The conspiracy often used anonymizer services, such as The Onion Router (TOR), to access malware on victim networks and manage their hacking infrastructure, including servers, domains and email accounts. The conspiracy further attempted to obscure its hacking activities through other third -party services. For example, t he conspiracy used GitHub to both store malware and stolen data, which was concealed using steganography. The conspiracy also used Dropbox Application Programming Interface (API) keys in commands to upload stolen data directly to conspiracy -controlled Drop box accounts to make it appear to network defenders that such data exfiltration was an employee's legitimate use of -intrusion ALTERNATIVE CHARGES Saugus Woman Pleads Guilty to Trafficking Counterfeit Percocet Pills Containing Fentanyl.

(DMD, DEA, USPIS) http://www.justice.gov/usao- 152 D EPARTMENT OF STATE 153 DEPARTMENT OF STATE Department of State Appendix for FY 2021 Annual Report This appendix discusses the Department of State's role in Intellectual Property Enforcement. In FY 2021, the Department of State continued to promote international economic environments conducive to strong intellectual property (IP) regimes and thereby protect the products of U.S. ingenuity through efforts in Washington, DC, and in embassies and consulates around the world. The Department of State advocates for strong IP protection and enforcement in bilateral policy dialogues and in multilateral fora; collaborates with bilateral, interagency, and private sector partners on capacity building; monitors the state of IP protections and enforcement around the world to better address problem areas; and educates public and official audiences on the value of IP both to generat e economic growth and to improve people's quality of life. Aligned with the Biden -Harris Administration's foreign policy for a middle class, better IP protection and enforcement abroad allows U.S. companies, including small to medium enterprises, to conduct business around the world with greater confidence. The Department of State's lead on IP issues is the Office of Intellectual Property Enforcement (IPE), located in the Trade Policy and Negotiations Division in the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs (EB) in Washington, DC. IPE participates in a range of interagency bilateral and multilateral efforts, conducts research and outreach, and serves a central support function on all IP matters for the agency's personnel. Areas in which U.S. embassies work with their host governments include increasing politi cal will for strengthening copyright, patent, trademark, and other IP protections and their associated enforcement, as well as combatting forced technology transfer, online copyright piracy, and the production and sale of counterfeit goods. U.S. embassies and consulates report year -round on IP issues to keep Department of State headquarters and relevant U.S. government agencies up- to-date on key developments. Department of State economic sections at embassies also liaise with local and global representa tives of creative industries, manufacturers, and others about IP issues and advocate for U.S. rightsholders. State Department officials working on IP issues overseas collaborate with, and receive support from, many agencies, including the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) IP Attach\u00e9s, Department of State -funded Department of Justice (DOJ) International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (ICHIP) advisors, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Homeland Security Investigation (HSI) represen tatives. As the COVID- 19 pandemic limited in- person work and travel throughout the fiscal year, the Department of State quickly shifted to maximum telework status. With in -person activities limited based on local pandemic conditions, the Department of State adopted widespread use of video- conferencing and other technologies. This enabled the Department of State to continue crucial bilateral dialogues, create and participate in a broad range of IP -related events and activities, discuss IP issues with in teragency partners, and advance U.S. IP priorities overseas. What follows are illustrative examples of the broad, diverse range of work the Department of State performed on IP issues during the reporting period. 154 Diplomacy to Advance and Protect IP Righ ts The United States has more than 270 diplomatic missions around the world. In addition to IPE efforts in Washington, DC, embassies and consulates feature Foreign Service Officers (FSOs) and locally employed staff who work to advance IP protection and combat IP infringement. They advocate for U.S. rightsholders and alert Department of State headquarters and relevant U.S. government agencies about opportunities to collaborate with the foreign governments and others, including to improve IP conditions by reviewing legislative and judicial matters, policy changes, and economic and political conditions that affect the IP environment. In addition to fulfilling Department of State activities on IP issues, the embassies and consulates support the overseas wor k of other U.S. government agencies through their economic sections, public affairs sections, and other Department of State offices. This assistance takes many forms including information gathering, diplomatic engagement to facilitate and coordinate bilat eral discussions, participation in public IP -related events, organizing official U.S. government delegations addressing IP issues, and leading follow -up activities to high -level, IP -focused bilateral meetings. Below are illustrative examples of the work that Department of State staff undertook during FY 2021. Algeria: The U.S. Embassy in Algiers continued to support IP rights priorities.

The social entrepreneurs shared how they incorporated green and sustainable initiatives in their enterprises and discussed how IP protection enhanced their value propositions, helped foster environmental innovation, and supported products that can help meet U.S. and Philippine climate targets. IP practitioners complemented the discussion with a presentation on integrating IP into an enterprise's business model. The audience engaged actively with the panel during the question -and-answer session. Poland: The U.S. Embassy in Warsaw organized a virtual event on April 26 on Local to Global: The Role of IP Ma nagement in Technology Transfer to celebrate World IP Day. The charg\u00e9 d'affaires opened the event, followed by a discussion panel of three IP experts from the United States and Poland. Forty people participated in the online event, largely consisting of entrepreneurs, start -ups and SME owners, representatives of the university transfer technology centers, and science and technology centers. The event emphasized the importance of modern IP systems for building stronger and more resilient businesses to be ready for international expansion. Saudi Arabia: The U.S. Mission Saudi Arabia used social media to promote World IP Day. Seychelles: The Port Louis -based U.S. Embassy in Mauritius and Seychelles held two events to celebrate World IP Day in Seychelles. The first event was a two -day workshop targeted at SMEs which started with a basic course led by State IPE. On the second day, a musician who is a strong advocate for IP protection explained the importance of copyright to her livelihood and advocated for strong IP protection related to streaming music platforms and international laws on copyright protection. Tunisia: The U.S. Embassy in Tunis' public affairs section partnered with USPTO's regional IP Attach\u00e9 and a Tunisian firm licensing U.S. technol ogy on an April 26 webinar to celebrate World IP Day. The event drew over 30 participants. Vietnam : To celebrate World IP Day, the U.S. Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City, USAID's Linkages for Small and Medium Enterprises (LinkSME ) project, and the U.S.- ASEAN Connect Digital Economy Series jointly organized an April 26 hybrid forum. The event brought together representatives of approximately 200 Vietnamese SMEs in -person and virtual participants from around Southeast Asia for a br oad range of discussions on how protecting brands, data, and IP is critical for SMEs as they adopt digital transformation strategies. Government and private sector officials underscored the growing challenge of IP enforcement in the digital realm, while representatives from online platforms and services showcased tools to enable SMEs to access the digital economy. 163 Washington, DC: State IPE organized a webinar for a global audience that featured a panel of U.S. entrepreneurs who shared their IP journeys, including a discussion of the issue of counterfeits. Multilateral Engagement The Department of State works closely with our interagency partners to ensure U.S. views are known and incorporated in global regulatory, standard- setting bodies and i n trade -focused organizations. The Department of State participates in U.S. delegations to multilateral forums and international organizations with global IP protection and enforcement implications including the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) Council for Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Council ), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the World Customs Organization (WCO) Enforcement Committe e, the Intellectual Property Rights Experts Group (IPEG) of the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, the Group of 7 (G7), the Group of 20 (G20), and various United Nations (UN) bodies. Within such multilateral fora, State IPE participates in interagency processes to review resolutions, declarations, and other statements and ensure that U.S. IP priorities are accurately reflected. Depending on the venue and in the event that multiple rounds of negotiations do not result in a document that refl ect U.S. views, an Explanation of Position or an Explanation of Vote may be issued to clarify U.S. policies. A few examples of multilateral documents containing IP equities issued in 2021 include the World Health Assembly's Strengthening local production of medicines and other health technologies to improve access , the World Health Assembly's Strengthening WHO preparedness for and response to health emergencies , multiple resolutions for the UN's Human Rights Council, the UN's Ministerial Declaration for th e High - Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, the G7 Carbis Bay Communique , and the G20 Rome Declaration. The United States reports on its incentives to promote and encourage technology transfer to least-developed country (LDC) WTO members in t he annual Article 66.2 Report. IPE receives input from missions overseas, regional and functional bureaus, and interagency partners on the range of U.S. government technology transfer and capacity building activities around the world. IPE submits the Art icle 66.2 Report to the WTO TRIPS Council annually. The broad range of activities covered in this report - including laboratory- based scientific collaboration, capacity building and education, and IP enforcement activities - highlight the United States' e fforts to promote effective and voluntary transfer of technology to LDC members. The United States also engaged at the WTO TRIPS Council in FY 2021 on proposals related to the COVID- 19 pandemic response. Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures, so in May 2021, in service of ending the pandemic, the United States announced support for a waiver of IP protections for COVID -19 vaccines under the WTO TRIPS Agreement. IPE oversaw the Department of State's response to inquiries on this polic y, including by supporting and coordinating with U.S. embassies and consulates around the world. 164 Other activities that the Department of State participated in during FY 2021 include the following. In October 2020, IPE leadership attended the first Global Intellectual Property Challenges Forum. While not an official G20 event, the virtual gathering brought together representatives of G20 members' IP agencies to discuss responses to the COVID -19 pandemic. IPE leads the U.S. delegation to the OECD Ta sk Force on Countering Illicit Trade (TF - CIT). The Department of State's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Trade Policy and Negotiations gave one of the two keynote speeches at the TF -CIT's ninth annual meeting, which was held in March 2021. The remarks linked U.S. efforts to fight illicit trade, including IP infringement, with the new U.S. Administration's trade and national security principles. Investment Climate Statements Every year, economic officers at U.S. embassies and other diplomatic missions p repare Investment Climate Statements analyzing more than 170 foreign markets to help U.S. companies make informed business decisions regarding overseas investments and operations. Each Investment Climate Statement focuses on an individual country market a nd includes a chapter on IP. These Statements also form a chapter of the Department of Commerce's Country Commercial Guides and can be read together with those guides for a broad description of the investment and business environments in foreign economies . The State Department continues to work with the Department of Commerce to further align the complementary Statements and Guides for a more unified experience for the end user . Science and Technology Agreements (STAs) The United States finalized STAs with Greece, Georgia, Estonia, Israel and Serbia. All included IP annexes. Interagency Policy Cooperation IPE, working with U.S. embassies and consulates around the world, engages with U.S. stakeholders and foreign governments to ensure that the U.S. government's positions are informed by the full range of views on pertinent issues, and encourages trading partners to engage fully and transparently with the full range of IP stakeholders. These thorough \"on- the- ground\" explorations of overseas IP envir onments support bilateral policy decisions by deepening U.S. departments' and agencies' knowledge. For example, the Department of State provided extensive support to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR ) and interagency colleagues for USTR's IP -related reports, including the annual Special 301 Report and Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy. At IPE's request , posts around the world submitted detailed analyses of IP protection and enforcement conditions, as well as insight s into trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy. 165 The International Visitor Leadership Program The International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) is the U.S. Department of State's premier professional exchange program. Through short -term projects (held in the United States when circumstances permit), current and emerging foreign leaders in a variety of fields experience the United States firsthand and cultivate lasting relationships with their American counterparts. Professional meetings reflect th e participants' professional interests and support the foreign policy goals of the United States. In fiscal year 2021, ECA organized three virtual IVLP projects related to IP: Intellectual Property Rights Formation, a project geared toward the East Asia and Pacific region. Participants in the April/May 2021 project were from Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, and Fiji. IPR Enforcement and Protection in the United States , a July 2021 project for participants from the People's Republic of China. Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property Commercialization, a project for participants from Egypt held in September 2021. The U.S. Transnational and High -Tech Crime Global Law Enforcement Network International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Proper ty (ICHIP) Advisor Program The U.S. Transnational and High- Tech Crime Global Law Enforcement Network (GLEN) consists of Global Cyber Forensic Advisors (GCFAs) and International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (ICHIPs) Advisors , who are exper ienced DOJ prosecutors posted at U.S. overseas missions to strengthen regional enforcement coordination and deliver capacity building training. ICHIPs are located in Panama City, Panama; Zagreb, Croatia; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; The Hague, Netherlands; Hong Kong, China SAR; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Bucharest, Romania; Abuja, Nigeria; Bangkok, Thailand; and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. In addition, two ICHIPs are deployed out of Washington, DC, to specifically address dark market/cryptocurrency and online consumer prot ection -related aspects of cybercrime and IP theft. The GLEN is almost entirely funded and managed by the Department of State INL/GPP with the exception being ICHIP Bangkok, who is funded by the Department of Justice and staffed by DOJ personnel. The GLE N works with foreign countries to strengthen IP protection and enforcement leading to more effective investigation and prosecution of IP offenses. INL/GPP consults closely with IPE in program development and implementation. The ICHIPs have regional responsibilities to: (1) assess the capacity of law enforcement authorities throughout the region to enforce IP; (2) develop and deliver training and other capacity building formats designed to enhance the capacity of justice secto r personnel to enforce IP; (3) assist in developing or strengthening institutions dedicated to enforcing IP; (4) monitor regional trends in IP protection and computer crimes; and (5) provide expert assistance in support of U.S. IP and computer crimes polic ies and initiatives in the region. The GCFAs, in 166 coordination with ICHIPs, deliver digital forensics training for investigators, while the long -term federal agent mentors are designed to be paired with an ICHIP to deliver sustained mentoring to foreign counterparts. INL also provides funding to the DHS ICE/HSI IPR Center and the USPTO to deliver foreign law enforcement training and technical assistance to complement the work of the GLEN. DHS and USPTO -delivered workshops ensure that patent and trademark agencies and foreign border and customs agencies receive IP enforcement capacity building tailored to their missions. DHS and USPTO programming is closely coordinated with the work of the GLEN. INL funds also support DHS providing U.S. trainers to parti cipate in INTERPOL -managed IP workshops around the world. Capacity Building and Training The Department of State, using foreign assistance anti -crime funds managed by INL, has a longstanding program to provide U.S. government capacity -building training and technical assistance to foreign law enforcement partners to combat IP crime and to deter widespread commercial -scale pirated and counterfeit goods and services. The Department of State works with other agencies to prioritize assistance to developing countries that are named in USTR's Special 301 Report as countries of concern. Examples of training successes through the ICHIP program include the following. ICHIP S\u00e3o Paulo mentored officials of Brazil's Ministry of Justice and Public Security, who seized approximately 330 websites and mobile applications that facilitated the illicit streaming and/or downloading primarily of films, television series, and live sporting events. This was part of the second phase of Operac\u00e3o 404 (Operation 404), a webs ite and domain- blocking operation that targets online digital pirates who stream copyrighted content (dismantling over 200 websites, including several registered in the U.S., and arresting website administrators throughout Brazil). This was the largest -ever takedown of its type in Brazil. Authorities also removed advertisements of these services from social media platforms and de -indexed them from leading search engines to limit their availability to users. Pursuant to judicial order, visitors attempting to access the seized sites were redirected to a Brazilian government server hosting a banner declaring the site has been removed for violations of law. Civil Police also executed eighteen search warrants at multiple locations in multiple states including Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Norte, and Santa Catarina, while authorities also detained the administrators of sites seized by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia with ICHIP support. The S\u00e3o Paulo ICHIP provided numerous train ings throughout Brazil and Latin America and the Caribbean on counterfeit pharmaceuticals and fraud connected to COVID -19 vaccines, and in celebration of World IP Day hosted an online event with the private sector to demonstrate techniques and best practices to combat third -party vendor counterfeiting on online platforms. The S\u00e3o Paulo ICHIP also mentored police and prosecutors in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio, who have seized and are prosecuting large -scale manufacturers and sellers of counterfeit goods; this include s an online counterfeit shoe 167 vendor found in possession of over $20 million USD in counterfeit shoes, and a perfume counterfeiter responsible for fabricating over $100 million USD in counterfeit fragrances. ICHIP Hong Kong worked with Vietnamese prosecutors and the judiciary to help Vietnam enact significant revisions to its criminal IP statute. The Vietnam Supreme People's Court requested and received assistance for the lower courts on the proper implementa tion of the new laws. The ICHIP facilitated U.S. experts to assist with the drafting process for a judicial resolution on the new laws and organized a judicial workshop. ICHIP Abuja created roundtable working groups consisting of select alumni from its several regional pharmaceutical crime and IP enforcement workshops for continuing engagement and formal follow -up/case mentoring, with the support of private sector rightsholders. Many are also serving as ambassadors for the work the group is doing, spearheading national groups in Sierra Leone, the Gambia, and Namibia. The Washington, DC -based ICHIP for Internet- Based Fraud and Public Health participated in delivery of a webinar series on online investigations of counterfeit pharmaceuticals for Bulgari an law enforcement, moderating a discussion with three COVID- 19 vaccine manufacturers who shared examples of the latest fraud and counterfeits that target the public, governments, and the medical supply chain. ICHIP Panama worked with Jamaican officials t o address capacity -building needs for law enforcement officials in the wake of the cyberattack on the Jamaican Government COVID- 19 website, including how to obtain electronic evidence from U.S. providers, emerging trends and challenges in digital forensics , best practices for seizing cryptocurrencies, and extracting data from encrypted or passcode -protected devices. The ICHIP agreed to serve as a bridge to the appropriate liaisons in key Jamaican ministries and agencies. In addition, in FY 2021, IPE a ssumed a coordinating role to generate meaningful results of the IP training programs that multiple federal agencies conduct overseas. Working with interagency partners, IPE compiled a list of the IP -related trainings, identified priority countries where the United States may be able to make real progress, and started the process of developing coordinated training plans to maximize both U.S. resources and impact. Internal Education Activities The Department of State is committed to educating its emplo yees about IP issues. IPE , in partnership with USPTO's Global IP Academy , coordinated a two- day virtual training course on IP issues for U.S. government officials in July 2021. The course, which is usually held in- person at the USPTO, was held virtually because of the COVID -19 pandemic. Most participants were FSOs preparing for onward assignments domestically or overseas. The training also included civil servants and locally employed staff of U.S. overseas diplomatic posts. Experts and stakeholders bri efed attendees on IP fundamentals, U.S. government positions on current IP \"hot topics,\" and U.S. industry priorities. These officials are now better equipped to advocate for 168 U.S. rightsholders and to articulate U .S. government policy positions in bilater al discussions and in international fora. IPE also trained FSOs, locally employed staff, and representatives from various U .S. government agencies in sessions of the Foreign Service Institute's classes on Commercial Tradecraft. The training provided participants with the latest U.S. policy perspectives on international IP issues , enabling them to advocate better for U.S. rightsholders overseas. In addition, in FY 2021, IPE launched a specialized, ongoing webinar series to brief Department of State employees in Washington and around the world on timely issues. Topics have included preparing IPE information for interagency use, regional discussions on the DOJ's ICHIP program, and an interagency panel discussion on current global IP protection and enf orcement challenges, including counterfeits. 169 D EPARTMENT OF TREASURY 170 DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY Department of the Treasury Appendix for FY 2021 Annual Report This appendix discusses the FY 2021 activities of the Department of the Treasury. Treasury IP -related efforts on Customs Treasury authority for border enforcement of intellectual property laws, along with certain other customs revenue functions, has been delegated to DHS and is carried out by CBP and ICE (see Treasury Order 100- 16 and 6 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 212, 215). Under the delegation, Treasury retains the sole authority to approve any regulations concerning copyright and trademark enforcement at the border and works closely on these promulgations with DHS and its components. Trea sury efforts to identify and address certain IP -related risks to national security through the CFIUS process The Secretary of the Treasury serves as Chairperson of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). CFIUS is an interagency committee authorized to review certain transactions that could result in control by a foreign person over a U.S. business in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States. Pursuant to the Foreign Investme nt Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA), which was signed into law on August 13, 2018, and subject to its implementing regulations, CFIUS also has the authority, among others, to review certain non- controlling investments by foreign persons in U.S. businesses that produce, design, test, manufacture, fabricate, or develop critical technologies, and this review may include aspects of a technology's underlying intellectual property. The Department of the Treasury continues to accept declarations and notices under its regulations implementing FIRRMA. Among other things, these regulations mandate the filing of a declaration with CFIUS for certain foreign investment transactions involving a U.S. business that produces, designs, tests, manufactures, f abricates, or develops one or more critical technologies based on whether certain U.S. Government export control authorizations would be required to export, re -export, transfer (in country), or retransfer such U.S. business's critical technology to certain transaction parties or their owners. CFIUS does not enforce intellectual property laws. If, however, during its review of a transaction CFIUS identifies a risk to U.S. national security arising from a foreign person's acquisition of, or access to, the intellectual property of a U.S. business, and if other authorities are not adequate or appropriate to address the identified risk, CFIUS will seek to mitigate such risk. Mitigation measures could take a variety of forms, including but not limited to plac ing the intellectual property in escrow; controlling the foreign person's access to the intellectual property; requiring mechanisms to monitor and enforce such access controls; and ensuring U.S. Government access to, or insight into, the intellectual prope rty. If CFIUS determines that the identified risk cannot be resolved through mitigation, CFIUS may refer the transaction to the President, who can, in accordance with section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as 171 amended, suspend or prohibit certa in transactions that threaten to impair the national security of the United States. Treasury authority to impose sanctions under Executive Order 13694, as amended, in response to certain malicious cyber -enabled activities, including the theft of trade sec rets for commercial or competitive advantage or private financial gain. Treasury continues to encourage referrals from relevant departments and agencies, including law enforcement and intelligence agencies, regarding targets for potential designation by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended by E.O. 13757. The Executive Order authorizes the imposition of sanctions on individuals and entities determined to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have engaged in, certain malicious cyber -enabled activities, including those \"causing a significant misappropriation of funds or economic resources, trade secrets, personal identifiers, or financial information for commercial or competitive advantage or pr ivate financial gain.\" 172 O FFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE 173 OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE USTR Appendix for FY 2021 Annual Report This appendix discusses the FY 2021 activities of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. One avenue to promote intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement abroad is through engagement with our trading partners. Through such engagement, the Administration advocates for strong IP protection and enforcement in other c ountries for, inter alia , creative works, brands, designs, trade secrets, and inventions by U.S. creators, inventors, artists, and businesses. Through direct engagement with foreign counterparts, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) emphasizes the importance that t he U.S. government places on protecting and enforcing IP, and presses for concrete action by trading partners to protect and enforce IP rights, including those owned by Americans. To advance the Administration's objectives, USTR uses a broad range of tr ade policy tools to promote strong IP rights protection and enforcement, including Section 301 of the Trade Act; the annual Special 301 review of IP protection and enforcement and related market access issues; trade agreement negotiations; monitoring and e nforcement of those agreements; trade and investment framework agreements; participation in the TRIPS Council at the World Trade Organization; and high -level engagement in multilateral and bilateral meetings. Given the international competitiveness of U .S. innovative and creative industries, the United States considers strong and effective protection and enforcement of IP rights as critical to U.S. economic growth and American jobs. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, 45.5 million American job s in 2014 were directly or indirectly supported by \"IP -intensive\" industries, and these jobs paid higher wages to their workers. In addition, in 2014, these IP -intensive industries accounted for $6.6 trillion in value added and 38.2 percent of the U.S. GD P. (See Department of Commerce, Intellectual Property and the U.S. Economy: 2016 Update , at https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/IPandtheUSEco nomySept2016.pdf .) Innovation and creativity are key export strengths for the United States. Combatting unfair IP trade policies will encourage domestic investment in the United States, foster American innovation and creativity, and increase economic sec urity for American workers and families. The USTR initiatives that have advanced IP protection and enforcement include the following. Section 301 Investigation into China's Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property and Innovation Law, Policies, Practices and Actions On August 14, 2017, the President of the United States issued a Memorandum instructing the Trade Representative to determine whether to investigate under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411) laws, policies, practices, or actions of the government of China that may be unreasonable or discriminatory and that may be harming American IP rights, innovation, or technology development. See 82 FR 39007. After consultation with the appropriate advisory comm ittees and the interagency Section 301 Committee, on August 18, 2017, USTR initiated an investigation into certain acts, policies, and practices of China related to 174 technology transfer, IP, and innovation. See 82 FR 40213. The investigation included a public hearing on October 10, 2017, and two rounds of public written comments from interested members of the public. On March 22, 2018, based on the investigation in response to the Presidential Memorandum, the Trade Representative issued a detailed repor t determining that China's acts, policies, and practices that force or pressure U.S. rightsholders to transfer technology and IP are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce, and are thus actionable under Section 301(b) of the Tr ade Act. In a notice published in the Federal Register on April 6, 2018, the Trade Representative found: China uses foreign ownership restrictions, such as joint venture requirements and foreign equity limitations, and various administrative review and l icensing processes, to require or pressure technology transfer from U.S. companies; China's regime of technology regulations forces U.S. companies seeking to license technologies to Chinese entities to do so on non- market -based terms that favor Chinese recipients; China directs and unfairly facilitates the systematic investment in, and acquisition of, U.S. companies and assets by Chinese companies to obtain cutting -edge technologies and intellectual property and generate the transfer of technology to Chine se companies; and China conducts and supports unauthorized intrusions into, and theft from, the computer networks of U.S. companies to access their sensitive commercial information and trade secrets. The President directed the Trade Representative to take all appropriate action under Section 301, including considering increased tariffs on goods from China. On April 6, 2018, USTR published a proposed list of products imported from China, worth approximately $50 billion in imports that could be subject to additional tariffs. After hearings and the receipt of numerous written comments, the USTR imposed additional tariffs of 25 percent on approximately $34 billion worth of imports from China, effective July 6, 2018. After a subsequent round of hearings and submissions, the USTR imposed additional tariffs of 25 percent on approximately $16 billion worth of imports from China, effective August 23, 2018. On September 24, 2018, USTR announced the imposition of additional tariffs of 10 percent on approximately $200 billion worth of imports from China, which were later increased to a rate of 25 percent effective January 1, 2019. At the direction of the President, the Trade Representative initially postponed the rate increase for the additional tariff on this th ird tranche of products in light of progress in discussions with China, but on May 10, 2019, increased the rate to 25 percent after China retreated from specific commitments from earlier rounds of negotiations. In May 2019, USTR requested public comment a nd, in June 2019, held a public hearing on a proposed tariff modification imposing additional tariffs of up to 25 percent on approximately $300 billion worth of imports from China. 175 On November 20, 2018, USTR released an update regarding its Section 301 investigation of China's acts, policies and practices related to technology transfer, IP and innovation.14 The update concluded that China had not fundamentally altered its acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, IP, and innovation that were the subject of the March 2018 report, and appeared to have taken further unreasonable actions in recent months.15 On March 23, 2018, the United States requested consultations with China under the WTO Dispute Resolution Understanding (in matter DS542). Consultations on DS542 were held in July 2018 but they did not resolve the dispute. On October 18, 2018, the United States requested that the WTO Dispute Settlement Body establish a panel to examine the U.S. complaint. After China blocked the first U.S. request for a WTO dispute settlement panel as provided for in the rules for dispute settlement proceedings, the Unite d States repeated its request to establish a WTO dispute settlement panel and a panel was established at the November 21, 2018 meeting of the Dispute Settlement Body. In March 2019, China revised the measures that the United States had challenged. The United States considered that China's actions had sufficiently addressed U.S. concerns, and after 12 months, the authority of the panel expired on June 8, 2021. In August 2019, the Trade Representative, at the direction of the President, determined to modif y the action being taken in the investigation by issuing a notice imposing additional tariffs of 15 percent on $120 billion worth of imports from China effective September 1, 2019, and additional tariffs of 15 percent on $160 billion worth of imports from China effective December 15, 2019. The Trade Representative also received public comments regarding a proposed modification to increase the rate of additional duties from 25 percent to 30 percent on imports from China covered by the three prior tariff act ions, with an approximate annual trade value of $250 billion. On January 15, 2020, the United States and China signed the Economic and Trade Agreement between Government of the United States of American and the Government of the People's Republic of Chi na (the \"Phase One Agreement\"), which requires, inter alia , structural reforms and other changes to China's economic and trade regime in the areas of IP, technology transfer, agriculture, financial services, and currency and foreign exchange. In light of progress in the negotiations with China, and at the direction of the President, the Trade Representative determined to suspend indefinitely the imposition of the additional duties of 15 percent on $160 billion worth of imports from China that had been sche duled for December 15, 2019. In addition, on February 14, 2020, the United States reduced from 15 percent to 7.5 percent the tariffs that had been imposed on September 1, 2019, on $120 billion worth of goods from China. Since the Phase One Agreement entered into force on February 14, 2020, the United States has been closely monitoring China's progress in implementing its commitments. The United States has also been fully utilizing the consultation arrangements set forth in the agreement for ensuring that China adheres to its obligations, including regular meetings required by the agreement between the two sides at the working level, the Deputy level and the Principal level. The two sides have also held numerous technical -level meetings. Through these many engagements, the United States has been able to raise and discuss with China any concerns that have arisen 14 https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/301%20Report%20Update.pdf 15 Id. 176 regarding China's implementation progress, and the two sides have generally been able to work through them in a constructive manner. The United States, Mexico, and Canada Agreement (USMCA) The United State -Mexico -Canada Agreement (USMCA) entered into force on July 1, 2020. The USMCA will support mutually beneficial trade leading to freer markets, fairer trade, and robust economic growth in North Am erica. It includes a modernized, high- standard IP chapter, which breaks new ground in U.S. trade and IP policy. It contains comprehensive protections against misappropriation of trade secrets, including by state -owned enterprises. It provides the most robust border enforcement mechanisms of any prior FTA. In addition, strong copyright protection and enforcement, more transparency in the grant of geographical indications (GI) protection or recognition, and full national treatment also promote the strong and effective protection and enforcement of IP rights that is critical to driving innovation, creating economic growth, and supporting American jobs. 16 In April 2021, the USMCA Committee on Intellectual Property Rights met to discuss resources, education, and programs that are available in Canada, Mexico, and the United States that help micro, small, and medium -sized enterprises address issues such as IP infringement. The United States continues to engage with Canada and Mexico to ensure full implementatio n of the IP protection and enforcement obligations. New Trade Negotiations The United States and the UK launched trade negotiations in May 2020 under the prior administration. After her confirmation in March 2021, United States Trade Representative Tai began a review of the status and objectives of the United States -UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to inform our next steps with the UK. In July 2020, the United States and Kenya launched trade negotiations under the prior administration. Through two negoti ating rounds, the United States and Kenya discussed a range of issues related to an IP chapter. USTR is reviewing the status and objectives of the negotiations before deciding next steps. Ongoing Trade Agreement Implementation and Enforcement In FY 2021, the U.S. continued to engage with Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partners (including Australia, Chile, Colombia, and Costa Rica) to ensure that FTA obligations, including those related to IP, are being implemented. 16 United States -Mexico -Canada Trade Fact Sheet: M odernizing NAFTA into a 21st Century Trade Agreement (October 1, https://ustr.gov/about 301 Report Each year, pursuant to statute, USTR issues the Special 301 Report on the adequacy and effectiveness of protection and enforcement of IP by our trading partners. The Special 301 Report is an important tool to engage with our trading partners to promote st rong protection for U.S. creative and innovative industries, as well as to promote compliance with trade commitments. USTR actively employs the Special 301 process to identify and address key IP challenges for American businesses and to document and encou rage continued progress in countries that undertake legislative and enforcement reforms following engagement under Special 301. USTR released the 2021 Special 301 Report in April 2021. (The 2021 Report is at https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/reports/2021/2021 Special 301 Report (final).pdf , and the related press is report, USTR highlighted serious and ongoing concerns with respect to the environment for IP rights protection and enforcement in China, India, Indonesia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and other markets. The Special 301 Report provides an opportunity to put a spotlight on foreign countries and the laws, policies, and practices that fail to provide adequate and effective IP protection and enforcement for U.S. inventors, creators, brands, manufacturers, and service providers, which, in turn, harm American workers whose livelihoods are tied to America's innovation -driven sectors. The Report identifies a wide range of concerns, including (a) challenges with border and criminal enforcement against counterfeits, including in the online environment; (b) high levels of online and broadcast piracy, including through illicit streaming devices; (c) inadequacies in trade secret protection and enforcement in China, Russia, and elsewhere; (d) troubling \"indigenous innova tion\" and forced technology transfer policies that may unfairly disadvantage U.S. rightsholders in markets abroad; and (e) other ongoing, systemic issues regarding IP protection and enforcement, as well as market access, in many trading partners around the world. Combatting such unfair trade policies will encourage domestic investment in the United States, foster American innovation and creativity, and increase economic security for American workers and families. Notorious Markets List The Notorious Markets List (NML) highlights select online and physical marketplaces that reportedly engage in or facilitate substantial copyright piracy or trademark counterfeiting. USTR has identified notorious markets in the Special 301 Report since 2006. In 2010, USTR announced that it would begin publishing the NML separately from the annual Special 301 Report, pursuant to an Out -of-Cycle Review. USTR first separately published the 2010 NML in February 2011, and has published an NML for every year since. In the NML , USTR highlights markets not only because they exemplify global concerns about counterfeiting and piracy, but also because the scale of infringing activity in such markets can cause significant economic harm to U.S. IP rightsholders. Some of the identifi ed markets 178 reportedly are host to a combination of legitimate and unauthorized activities. Others reportedly exist solely to engage in or facilitate unauthorized activity. The NML does not purport to be an exhaustive list of all physical and online marke ts worldwide in which IP rights infringement takes place. A goal of the NML is to motivate appropriate action by the private sector and governments to reduce piracy and counterfeiting. The operators of several websites identified in past NMLs have begun to work with rightsholders to address counterfeiting and piracy. Several markets have also ceased operations or have been the focus of government enforcement efforts. The 2020 Notorious Markets List was issued in January 2021. (The NML is at https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/Press/Releases/2020 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy (final).pdf , and the related press release 2020 NML includes a focus that explores e -commerce and the role of internet platforms in facilitating the importation of counterfeit and pirated goods into the United States. India The U.S. maintains bilateral engagement with India on IP issues through the High- Level IP Working Group under the United States -India Trade Policy Forum (TPF). USTR, working with its interagency partners (USPTO, U.S. Copyright Office, ITA, DOJ, Health and Human Services, FTC, and others), revitalized on- going engagement with Indian government counterparts during FY 2021, including IP Working Group meetings held in December 2020, and June and August 2021, and continued exchanges and activities centered on the robust protection of IP and enforcement of IP rights, with a focus on areas such as copyright, trade secrets, patents, and promoting innovation and creativity through high- level government policies. World Trade Organization Council on Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Council) The World Trade Organization (WTO) provides an additional venue for USTR to lead engagement with trading partners on IP rights issues, including through accession negotiations for prospective Members, the Council for Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Council), and the Dispute Settlement Body. In FY 2021, the United States advanced its IP and Innovati on agenda in the TRIPS Council by focusing on intellectual property and innovation in connection with the development of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The United States is working with WTO M ember s including Australia, Canada, Chile, Chinese Taipei , the European Union, Japan, Hong Kong, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, examining how IP protection and enforcement promote innovation and creativity to meet societal challenges and needs. 179 World T rade Organization Accession Governments in the process of negotiating the terms for accession to the WTO work with WTO Members, including the United States, to appropriately update and strengthen their IP regimes as well as to expand trade and enhance the investment climate for innovative and creative industries. Other Fora In addition to the WTO (which is the principal forum for addressing trade -related aspects of intellectual property), the United States also advanced these issues in other fora during FY 2021, including the OECD, WIPO, APEC forum, and various U.N. bodies. In the APEC Intellectual Property Experts Group (IPEG), the United States is continuing a series of workshops for IPEG members on the importance of industrial design protection a nd how developing modern design protections across APEC economies will promote economic growth. In addition, to build upon a survey issued by the United States for IPEG members on treatment of, and approaches to, illicit streaming devices (ISDs) under dom estic laws or regulations, the United States published the Report on Results of Survey Questionnaire on Domestic Treatment of Illicit Streaming and hosted a webinar on Content Protection and Illicit Streaming: Enforcement Approaches and Strategies . The United States also proposed an effective practices document for enforcement against illegal streaming, with the goal of obtaining APEC endorsement. Examples of Additional Areas of IP Rights Engagement In FY 2021, Ukraine 's CMO system remained a work in progress and a source of concern in terms of implementing a transparent, fair, and predictable collective management regime, despite Ukraine taking some positive steps on this issue. USTR, coordinating with interagency subject matter experts, also engaged with Ukrainian counterparts on next steps for addressing longstanding concerns such as online piracy and government use of unlicensed software, including through the TIC's Intellectua l Property Rights Working Group. USTR has been engaging with the government of South Africa in 2021 on copyright policy and other intellectual property protection issues including on its open review of South Africa's eligibility for the GSP program. USTR opened the review after accepting a petition from the International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) asserting that South Africa is not providing adequate and effective copyright protection and that, if South Africa enacts two pending copyright bills, it will move even further from i nternational norms. In June 2020, the president of South Africa had sent back to Parliament those two copyright bills, and, in June 2021, Parliament rescinded both bills. Legal authorization for the benefits under the GSP program expired on January 1, 20 21. As long as GSP remains without authorization, the USTR does not intend to hold public hearings, open new country eligibility reviews, or move toward final determinations of our ongoing reviews. 180 The Central Asia IP Working Group serves as an importa nt mechanism to provide sustained engagement on IP issues and help improve IP regimes in the region. The Working Group met virtually in January and July 2021, and at a United States -Central Asia TIFA Council meeting held in late March and early April 2021. In June 2021, the United States and Taiwan held a TIFA Council meeting under the auspices of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO). The two sides recognized progre ss that has been made, such as Taiwan's enforcement of trade secrets protections, and committed to intensify engagement aimed at addressing outstanding trade concerns, including with regard to concerns raised by the U.S. in areas such as cop yright legislat ion and digital piracy. The United States held a TIFA intersessional meeting with Pakistan in December 2020 and TIFA Council meetings with Nepal in December 2020, Fiji in February 2021, and Uruguay in August 2021. The United States also held a technica l meeting under the U.S.- Thailand TIFA in October 2020; the U.S.- Paraguay TIFA in December 2020 and subsequent technical meetings; the U.S.- Indonesia TIFA in September 2021; IP Working Group meetings under the United States -Kuwait TIFA in May and September 2021; a Trade Dialogue on IP protection and enforcement with the United Arab Emirates in June 2021; and an Innovation and Creativity Forum with Argentina in November 2020. These meetings discussed a range of issues relating to IP protection and enforcement, such as combatting the sale of counterfeit and pirated goods. Engagement with Stakeholders and the Public USTR frequently seeks public input from all sectors of society, including private citizens, non-governmental organizations, academia, consumer groups, small and medium -size businesses, and the business community (including innovators, content providers, and technology and other service providers). To this end, USTR holds public hearings; seeks written comments regarding negotiation objectives t hrough Federal Register notices; chairs regular sessions with designated public advisory committees; and disseminates trade policy materials such as press releases, factsheets, and statements on the USTR website. These dialogues are critical at every stage of USTR's work, including in connection with the process of negotiating, implementing, and enforcing trade rules. USTR also seeks public input for the annual Special 301 and Notorious Markets List processes. The annual Special 301 Report identifies countries that fail to a dequately and effectively protect or enforce IP rights or use unfair barriers to limit market access for U.S. businesses that rely on IP. The Notorious Markets List highlights prominent online and physical marketplaces that reportedly engage in or facilit ate substantial copyright piracy or trademark counterfeiting. USTR publishes requests for public comment in the Federal Register that provide opportunities for public input and rebuttals, and the submitted comments are available online. In addition, USTR holds a public hearing for the Special 301 process. 17 In addition to requesting comments from the public and 17 In 2021, due to COVID -19, USTR fostered public participation via written submissions rather than an in -person hearing with the interagency Special 301 Su bcommittee of the Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) sending 181 holding a public hearing on IP matters, IP trade policy figured heavily in USTR's broader stakeholder and Congressional outreach, including in a r ange of domestic and international fora. written questions about issues relevant to the review to those that submitted written comments, including to representatives of foreign governments, industry, and non- governmental organizations. 182 C OPYRIGHT OFFICE 183 COPYRIGHT OFFICE Copyright Office Appendix for FY 2021 Annual Report This appendix summarizes some of the key enforcement -related activities taken by the United States Copyright Office in FY 2021. Overview During FY 2021, the Office continued to work on a breadth of copyright -related issues, including the implementation of the Orrin G. Hatch -Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act (MMA); the creation of the Copyright Claims Board (CCB) p ursuant to the Copyright Alternative in Small- Claims Enforcement Act of 2020 (CASE Act); several policy studies; and efforts to modernize the Office's operations. The Office also provided law and policy advice to Congress, provided expert advice to the fe deral courts and executive branch agencies on domestic and international copyright matters, and conducted public outreach and education efforts. Please visit https://www.copyright.gov/ for more information on all of the Office's activities. Reports & Studies for Congress The Copyright Office advises Congress on national and international issues relating to copyright. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(b)(1). This advice includes providing requested opinions on pending and existi ng legislation as well as providing analyses on areas of copyright law. The Office seeks to ensure that all members of the copyright community - including copyright owners, technology companies, consumers, public interest groups, academics, and the genera l public - have robust opportunities to participate and contribute to the Office's policy studies, reports, and recommendations. During FY 2021, the Office completed two studies related to enforcement, one analyzing copyright owner remedies for state infr ingement and another recommending best practices to ensure copyright owners receive payment for works used by digital service providers. State Sovereign Immunity Study In response to the Supreme Court's ruling in Allen v. Cooper , Senators Thom Tillis and Patrick Leahy sent a letter to the Copyright Office on April 28, 2020, asking the Office to commence a public study to discover the degree to which copyright owners are experiencing copyright infringement by states without adequate remedies under state law ( https://www.copyright.gov/ policy/state -sovereign -immunity/letter.pdf ). In its March 2020 ruling in Allen v. Cooper , the Supreme Court held that Congress exceeded it s constitutional authority when it enacted legislation (the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act of 1990) that authorized copyright infringement suits to be brought against states for damages. Relying on the Court's prior decision in Florida Prepaid Postsec ondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank (1999), which addressed a 1992 statute that sought to abrogate state sovereign immunity from patent -infringement suits, the Court in Allen v. Cooper stated that 184 \"Florida Prepaid all but prewrote our decision t oday. That precedent made clear that Article I's Intellectual Property Clause could not provide the basis for an abrogation of sovereign immunity. And it held that Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment could not support an abrogation on a legislative reco rd like the one here.\" With respect to its conclusion that the legislative record for the 1990 copyright statute could not support its abrogation of state sovereign immunity, the Court explained that this conclusion \"need not prevent Congress from passing a valid copyright abrogation law in the future,\" stating that - in enacting the 1990 statute - \"Congress likely did not appreciate the importance of linking the scope of its abrogation to the redress or prevention of unconstitutional injuries \u2014and of creat ing a legislative record to back up that connection. But going forward, Congress will know those rules. And under them, if it detects violations of due process, then it may enact a proportionate response.\" To commence the study, the Copyright Office issued a notice of inquiry requesting comments on issues, such as specific instances of infringement committed by states, whether the infringement was intentional or reckless, and the availability of remedies under state law. The Office held public round tables for this study via Zoom and also accepted additional public comments and evidence from participants of the roundtable discussions who were not able to speak or submit materials during the event. The Office found that the evidence submitted indicate s that state infringement represents a legitimate concern for copyright owners. However, the Office could not conclude with certainty that the record would be found sufficient to meet the constitutional test for abrogation. The full report, public commen ts, recordings and transcripts of the roundtables, and additional materials submitted after the roundtable event can be found at https://www.copyright.gov/policy/ state- sovereign- immunity/ . Unclaimed Royalties Study In connection with the MMA, the newly designated Mechanical Licensing Collective (\"MLC\") is tasked with administering the new blanket license under section 115 of the Copyright Act; distributing royalties to songwriters and music publishers; and, among oth er duties, implementing policies and procedures for distributing unclaimed accrued royalties and interest after a prescribed holding period. As directed by the MMA, and in consultation with the Government Accountability Office, the Copyright Office undert ook a study to recommend best practices that the MLC may implement to identify and locate musical work copyright owners with unclaimed royalties, encourage those copyright owners to claim their royalties, and ultimately reduce the incidence of unclaimed royalties. Prior to FY 2021, the Office held a symposium featuring educational discussions of the issues; commissioned a report addressing global collective management organizations' approaches to obtaining ownership information, reducing the instance of unclaimed royalties and royalty distribution; and issued a notice of inquiry seeking public comments for the report. During FY 2021, the Office held public roundtables and received materials from roundtable participants who wished to share additional inform ation during the event but were unable to do so. 185 The report recommends that the MLC should: engage, to the broadest extent reasonably possible, in conducting education and outreach activities; make sure that its public facing systems or services are simple, accessible, well - organized, and user -friendly, with flexible and robust tools, features, and functionality across multiple platforms; take reasonable steps to ensure that its data is of the highest possible quality; employ both automated and manual matching processes that rely on standard unique identifiers; adopt transparent, practical, and equitable policies, practices, and procedures, especially with respect to holding and distributing unclaimed royalties; closely monitor and track a wide variety of metrics and continually review and analyze them to evaluate its level of success and relative effectiveness over time; and be transparent about its activities and continue to engage regularly with stakeholders. The full report as well as public comments, the notice of inquiry, the symposium materials, and materials from the public roundtables are available at https://www.copyright.gov/policy/ unclaimed -royalties/ . Rulemakings During FY 2021, the Copyright Office engaged in a number of additional rulemakings. A list of both open and closed rulemakings is available at https://www.copyright.gov/ rulemaking/ . An illustrative list of enforcement- related rulemakings appears below. MMA Rulemakings The MMA was enacted in October 2018 and addressed licensing to ensure music streaming services, or digital service providers, do not infringe copyright in the operation of their services. The MMA requires, among other things, that the Copyright Office adopt several regulations to govern the new blanket licensing system created under Title I of the MMA, known as the Musical Works Modernization Act. The blanket licensing system replaces the existing song -by- song compulsory licensing structure for making and distributing musical works with a blanket licensing system for digital music providers to make and distribute digital phonore cord deliveries (e.g., permanent downloads, limited downloads, or interactive streams). The blanket licensing system became available January 1, 2021. In FY 2021, the Office continued rulemakings under the MMA, issuing three interim rules and one final r ule. The first interim rule addresses a variety of reporting obligations between blanket 186 licensees or significant nonblanket licensees and the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC). The second interim rule prescribes the categories of information to be i ncluded in the public musical works database and rules related to the usability, interoperability, and usage restrictions of the database. The third interim rule creates various restrictions on the disclosure and use of confidential information by the MLC and digital licensee coordinator (DLC), as well as their employees, agents, consultants, vendors, independent contractors, and members of their board of directors and committees. The final rule addresses cumulative statements of account required to be su bmitted by digital music providers to the MLC for such providers to be eligible for the statutory limitation on liability for unlicensed uses of musical works prior to the January 1, 2021 license availability date. For more on the MMA and the Office's imp lementation of this act, see https://www.copyright.gov/music -modernization/ . CASE Act and the Copyright Claims Board In December 2020, Congress enacted the Copyright Alternative in Small -Claims Enforcement Act of 2020 (CASE Act) to establish a new Copyright Claims Board (CCB) that would be a voluntary \"small copyright claims\" tribunal comprised of three Copyright Claims Officers who will have the authority to render determinations on certain copyright claims of low financial value. The CASE Act directs the Office to adopt several regulations to govern the CCB and its procedures. The statute further vests the Office with general authority to adopt such regulations as may be necessary or appr opriate to effectuate the Board. To assist in promulgating these regulations, the Office sought public comment and completed a rulemaking proceeding to establish procedures for a new expedited registration option for works at issue before the CCB. The ru le enables a claimant or counterclaimant with a pending copyright registration application to seek expedited review of that application. The CCB cannot proceed with a dispute involving a work for which registration is still pending or has been denied. The Office also issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to address procedures for libraries and archives to preemptively opt out of proceedings before the CCB and to propose procedures related to federal court class action proceedings for a party who is befor e the Board. This rulemaking will continue into FY 2022. The Office plans on publishing additional CASE Act notices of proposed rulemaking and final rules before the Copyright Claims Board begins operations. All CASE Act -related rulemakings can be fou nd at https://copyright.gov/rulemaking/case -act- implementation/ . Additional information be found here: https://copyright.gov/about/small -claims/ . Recordation and Notices of Termination Notices of termination are a mechanism by which authors or their heirs, under certain circumstances, can terminate the exclusive or nonexclusive grant of a transfer or license of an author's copyright in a work or of a ny of the exclusive right s under a copyright . The Copyright Office issued amendments to its regulations governing recordation of notices of termination 187 under sections 203 and 304(c) of the Copyright Act. In addition, the Office announced changes to its examination practices for certain notices of termination that pertain to multiple grants. The changes relate to regulatory provisions governing timeliness, harmless errors, manner of service, and the date of recordation for notices of termination. These amendments are intended to improve efficiency in the processing of notices in conjunction with the development of the Office's online electronic recordation system. International Activities Throughout the year, the Copyright Office continued to provide outreach and education regarding copyright issues to foreign officials via video meetings. The Office also hosted international programs to discuss and exchange information on the U.S. copyright system and significant international copyright issues. The Office works with other agencies, including the State Department, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), to participate in meetings affecting int ernational policy decisions on intellectual property enforcement and other IP topics. Advise Executive Branch Agencies on International Copyright & Trade Matters The Copyright Office supports USTR and other executive branch agencies by serving on offici al delegations and negotiating teams, as part of its statutory duties (17 U.S.C \u00a7 701(b)). In FY 2021, the Office supported the U.S. government delegations to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) where the Standing Committee on Copyright an d Related Rights (SCCR) has been discussing, among other topics, a draft treaty that would protect broadcasting organizations against signal piracy. The Office also participated in the annual Special 301 review facilitated by USTR, including the Notorious Markets out -of-cycle review, and engaged in regular consultation with executive branch agencies on copyright law and enforcement developments in other countries, including draft legislation and guidance documents, compliance efforts, World Trade Organiza tion trade policy reviews and accessions, the proposed Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights waiver, and reviews under trade preference programs. International Copyright Institute Every two years, the Copyright Office and WIPO co- host th e International Copyright Institute, a week -long program designed to provide representatives from developing countries and countries in transition with a deeper understanding of copyright law in the digital age. Participants learn about a range of topics, including new distribution models for digital content, modern copyright registration systems, and enforcement challenges. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the International Copyright Institute was postponed a year and held in a condensed and virtual format in July 2021. The two- day program, New Copyright Developments in the United States of America and Internationally , invited participants from twenty -four countries to discuss topical and emerging issues in the field of copyright that are taking place in the U.S. and internationally, including the Music Modernization Act and CASE Act, the rapidly changing digital environment, and the global impact of the pandemic on copyright. 188 Copyright Office Modernization Over the past several years, the Copyright Office has engaged in several modernization efforts to provide a more user -centered and flexible design for the Office's electronic registration, recordation, and public record work streams, along with modernizing the Office's information technology (IT) support systems. More information about the Office's modernization efforts can be found at https://www.copyright.gov/copyright -modernization/ . The Office also hosts a bimonthly webinar series that focuses on various aspects of the modernization process. All webinars can be found at https://www.copyright.gov/copyright -moder nization/webinar/ . Copyright Public Modernization Committee The Library of Congress established a new Copyright Public Modernization Committee (CPMC) to expand and enhance communication with external stakeholders on IT modernization of Copyright Office Systems. Committee members were selected by the Librarian from a pool of applicants for their ability to represent a broad cross section of the copyright community and other interested groups. The committee will meet twice a year through 2024 to publicly share information and answer questions about the IT -related aspects of Copyright Office modernization. A list of the CPMC members is available at https://www.copyright.gov/newsnet/2021/898.html . Circular 92 Update Being able to access the current law is important for copyright owners to know how to enforce their rights. The Copyright Office released an updated version of Copyright Law of the United States and Related Laws Contained in Title 17 of the United States Code in both online and physical versions. Also known as Circular 92, this publication contains the text of the Copyright Act, including all amendments enacted by Congress through December 27, 2020, including the CASE Act of 2020. Fair Use Index The Copyright Office hosts and maintains the Fair Use Index, which was undertaken in coordination with the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator. This searchable database contains notable cases from U.S. courts that comment on fair use law. The I ndex contains more than 200 cases. The Office continually updates the Index to keep practitioners and the public informed of new or prominent issues in fair use law, the application of fair use to a variety of types of works, and the law across appellate jurisdictions in the United States. The Index contains clear and concise language describing the facts and outcome of each case, making the Index accessible to the general public and providing valuable information\u2014including a full legal citation \u2014to aid a viewer in further research. The Fair Use Index is hosted at https://www.copyright.gov/fair -use/ . 189 Public Outreach The Copyright Office implements a full program of outreach activities to educate the public regarding copyright protections. The Office's outreach programs cover a wide range of formats and media, including live presentations, video tutorials, social media, and participation in programs hosted by outside organizations. Illustrative exam ples include the following. Public events: In April 2021, the Copyright Office celebrated World Intellectual Property Day with a program, The Creative Business: Celebrating World IP Day and Taking Your Ideas to Market , which reflects the World Intellectu al Property Organization's 2021 theme. This event featured a discussion of the importance of small and medium businesses in copyright, the economy, and our culture. Panelists provided insights into how to navigate copyright issues that are unique to smal l and medium businesses. The Office also hosted a virtual event celebrating the enduring copyright legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Legal audience events: The Copyright Office, in conjunction with the Georgetown Intellectual Property and Informa tion Policy Clinic and Georgetown Institute for Law and Policy Online, hosted a discussion on the legacy of former Register Barbara Ringer and the importance of creating space and opportunities in copyright and developing more diverse and inclusive legal systems for the benefit of all. The Register of Copyrights and senior staff also spoke on a wider number of issues at several events with legal audiences (such as the American Bar Association, the International Trademark Association (INTA), and the Copyrig ht Society) and at other legal and academic events. Outreach for Creators: The Copyright Office published How Songwriters, Composers, and Performers Get Paid , a guide breaking down different music royalty streams and the importance of copyright. The C opyright Office participated in the Imaging USA (IUSA) photography conference, answering photographers' questions about copyright and enforcement. The Copyright Office launched a new webpage to help the music community understand copyright principles, inc luding the various types of works , registration, how to use others' works , infringement, and important laws affecting the music community.
