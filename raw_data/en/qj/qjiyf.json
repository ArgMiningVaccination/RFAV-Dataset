Yes, you guessed it right.....achieving strong immunity also lies in a strong digestive system! So do not tax your digestion at this time by eating heavy, rich, difficult to digest meals at this time. Instead, eat easy to digest meals like [kitchari](https://www.ayurvedavancouver.com/kitchari), lentil soups, vegetable soups, cooked vegetables. Include spices such as [turmeric, ginger, black pepper, cumin, coriander, fennel & cinnamon](https://ayurvedashop.ca/collections/foods-spices)in your diet. [Chyavanprash](https://ayurvedashop.ca/products/chyavanprash-herbal-jam?_pos=1&_sid=d28678c09&_ss=r)is an herbal jam made up of amalaki and herbs and spices to boost immune system and improve strength & vitality. Take 1 tsp- 2 tsp every morning. Emphasize on immune boosting foods----Fruits and vegetables rich in Vitamin A, C, E, Zinc, selenium, healthy fats (Omega 3) and proteins. Use bitter herbs - dandelion tea (good for reducing kapha toxins). It is really important to keep the toxic load as low as possible so that your immune system can fight the virus! Ayurveda also offers many [immunity boosting herbs](https://ayurvedashop.ca/collections/immunity-1)such as amla, tulsi, turmeric, etc. Avoid cold, heavy, oily \" [Kapha-genic foods](http://tiny.cc/6mqc9y)\". They reduce agni and in turn weaken immune system. I.e. Avoid ice cold water with meals, avoid cheese, ice cream, yogurt, fried foods and packaged foods at all cost. Follow all the rules of Dinacharya - Ayurvedic daily routines - and live in sync with nature. I.e. Use [tongue scrapers](https://ayurvedashop.ca/products/tongue-scraper?_pos=1&_sid=3cdf07410&_ss=r), [neti pot](https://ayurvedashop.ca/products/neti-pot?_pos=1&_sid=45e1e9d1c&_ss=r), do oil [self-massage](https://ayurvedashop.ca/blogs/ayurveda-readings/abhyanga-self-massage-routine)etc. to cleanse toxins daily. Learn and follow Ritucharya - Ayurvedic seasonal routines - by eating according to the season and following an appropriate lifestyle routine per season. MOST IMPORTANT- MANAGE STRESS! Stress has a direct effect on the immune system. It also impairs Agni leading to Ama (toxins) which taxes the immune system as well as overloads the liver. Pranayamas and meditation help to reduce stress, expand lung capacity, and keep the mind peaceful. Follow a good sleep schedule - must go to bed by 10:00 pm. If you need to pick two most important points from this blog, I would suggest you pick this last one along with managing stress and keep calm. It's a passing phase. Be positive!
