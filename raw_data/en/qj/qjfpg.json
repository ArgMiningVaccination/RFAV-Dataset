Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed ii Executive Summary This report provides an overview of the m ethamphetam ine problem in the United States. It looks at the history of the probl em, trends in use, characterist ics of users, adverse effects, trafficking and production and treatment issues. The analysis relies on extensive review of extant literature on the drug, anal ysis of existing datasets relevant to m ethamphetam ine use, and conversations with law enforcem ent treat ment, and governm ent personnel dealing with the problem . History of Methamphetamine Use Ampheta mines, including m etham phetam ine, were first synth esized in the early p art of the 20th century, although they were not identified for m edical use until the 1930s. First manufactured as a bronchial d ilator, they were q uickly p rescribed for a variety of other conditions\u2014narcolepsy, attention deficit disorder, obesity, and fatigue. W ith an increasing problem of abuse of thes e drugs due to lega l availability and easy access in the 1950s and 1960s, am phetam ines/m ethampheta mine were m ade Schedule II substances in 1970. Through the next decad e, further restrictions on prescriptions and on the p recurso r chem icals needed for m anufacture resulted in reduction s in use nationwide. Metham phetam ine had faded from a previous national popularity ri valed only by m arijuana until reappearing in Hawaii and the W est in the 1980s. Trends Throughout the 1990s, m ethamphetamine use grew st eadily in the W est and Northwest. By the tu rn of the m illenniu m, it had rea ppeared in many areas of the Midwest and South and surfaced to a lesser degree in the Northeast a nd Mid Atlan tic. In the gen eral populatio n, as reflected in the National Survey on Drug Us e and Health (NSDUH), m ethampheta mine use rose from just under 2% of the adult popul ation in 1994 to approxim ately 5% in 2004. Reporting on youth, Monitoring the Future (MT F) reports that am phetam ine/methampheta- mine use has rem ained stable ov er the last decade for both 8th graders and 12th graders, dropping slightly in 2003. Data from the Y outh Behavioral Risk Surveillance System (YBRSS) shows sim ilarly stable, if not sligh tly declining, numbers of users am ong youth nationwide. National tre atment data f rom the Treatm ent Episode Data Set (TEDS) on adm issions to treatm ent indicate a steady rise in the num ber of persons nati onwide who enter tre atment f or methamphetamine abuse. From 1992 to 2002 the rate of treatm ent adm issions for methamphetamine abuse in the U.S. increased fivefold, from less than 1% in 1992 to over 6% in 2003. The Drug Abuse W arning Network emergency room reports show a sim ilar trend nationally: a slight rise from just under 16,000 m entions in 1995 to 17,696 in 2002. Abt Associates Inc. Methampheta mine Use: Lessons Learned iii But National trends are seriously m isleading. W hile national data such as these show som e increases, albeit at low levels, regional da ta on metham phetam ine use provide a far more serious picture of the problem . TEDS data show that in 1992 only tw o states (Hawaii and California) reported m ore than 5% of total treatm ent adm issions were for m ethamphetamine. In 2003, 26 states reported over 5%, 8 states reported over 20 %, and 2 states (Hawaii and Idaho) reported over 40% m ethamphetam ine adm issions. The highest rates were reported in Hawaii and the W est, where states lik e Ida ho reported 42%, N evada reported 28%, and California reported 31%. Midweste rn states like Iowa (20%), and Southern states like Arkansas (2 2%) also rep ort rates far higher than the nation al average. W hile the highe st rates of use rem ain in the W est and Midwest, ther e are increases in othe r new areas. In North Dakota, for exam ple, in 1992 no adm issions were for m ethamphetam ine; in 2003, 12% of North Dakota adm issions were for meth abuse. Regional dif ferences in DAWN e mergency room mentions ar e sim ilarly d ramatic. W hile some cities with high nu mbers of ER m entions f or meth have rem ained unchanged or e ven declined som ewhat (Los Angeles, S an Franci sco, San Diego, Dallas, Denver), other areas have experienced enorm ous upswings in ER m entions since 1995: Seattle (109% increase), Minneapolis (243% increase), New Orleans (1 94% increase), St. Louis (97% increase). These regional trends are m irrored in the A rrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) data. In 11 ADAM s ites in 2003, 25% of arrestees test ed positive for m ethamphetamine in their system s; only one site had a proportion that high in 1996. Characteristics of Users and Adverse Effects Unlike m any other illegal drugs, m etham pheta mine is a drug that app eals equally to m en and wom en. All of the national data sets show an a lmost equal gender split f or self reported m eth use. Users also tend to be W hite and in their 20s and 30s. Though both cocaine and methamphetamine are stimulants, a com parison of characteristics of m etham pheta mine users and cocain e or crack users indicates that th e two drugs do not, for the m ost part, share a common user group; that is, the d rugs do not seem to substitu te for each oth er or app eal to the sam e users. Metham phetam ine is a drug that has both acute toxic effects and can produce long term physiological problem s. It is a powerful central nervous system stim ulant that prom otes the release of neurotran smitters like dopam ine, norepinephrine an d seroton in, each of which controls the brain's m essaging system s for rewa rd and pleasure, sleep, appetite and mood. However, when ingested (injected, snorted, eaten), m eth produces prolonged euphoric or energized states. The adverse effects are bot h short-term (cardiac problem s, hypertherm ia, depression, confusion) and chr onic. When used chronically, m ethamphetamine causes long- term neural changes that result in impair ed m emory, m ood alterations, impaired m otor coordination, and psychiatric proble ms long afte r term ination of use. Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed iv Trafficking, Production, Regulation Metham phetam ine is synthesized from precurs or chem icals. Methods of production are commonly available on the Internet or in underground publications a nd can be executed by almost anyone with high school chem istry expe rience. Many of the chem icals used are household products that are not feasible to regulate. Howe ver, others (ephedrine and pseudoephedrine products, anhydrous ammonia) have com e under serious scrutiny and legislation on both the state and Federal level has developed to monito r their sa le and lim it their availab ility f or illeg al uses. Metham phetam ine found in the U.S. is m ost ofte n produced dom estically or in Mexico. It is produced either in sm all \"Mom and Pop\" la bs m aking only a f ew pounds at a tim e or in superlabs which produce 10 pounds or m ore in a production cycle. Historically, needed precursor chem icals for large-scale production were sm uggled to labs prim arily in the Southwest and California, but current distribution is m ore geographically dispersed. The total num ber of meth clandestin e lab inciden ts/seizures has risen steadily f rom just over 9,000 (44 states reporting) in 2000 to approxim ately 16,000 (46 states reporting) in 2002, to just over 17,000 (47 states reporting) in 2003. Som e Western states (California, New Mexico, Idaho, Nevada, Colorado) have e xperienced significant declines in lab incidents/seizures, while states like L ouisian a, Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Georgia have seen the num bers of seizures /incidents, as much as tripled or quadrupled since 2000. While the num ber of \"Mom and Pop\" labs, of ten called S mall Toxic Labs or STLs, is far greater than the num ber of supe rlabs, DEA estimates that th e bulk of m eth on the m arket comes from superlabs. The dam age done to farm land, water supply, and vegetation from labs of any size, however, is a m ajor problem in all areas where m eth is m anufactured. Environm ental cleanup is costly and m ay require specialized equipm ent and training not available to local law en forcem ent. Control and regulation of the chem icals used in m eth production began in the 1980s and continues. In the 1990s, a series of laws ta rgeted ephedrine and ot her precursor chemicals and increased the penalties for m ethamphetam ine trafficking and m anufacture. In 2000, Congress passed the Metham pheta mine Anti-Prol iferation Act to address diversion of products containing pseudoephedrine, and introdu ced thresholds for these and other over the counter m edications con taining possible precur sor substan ces. Successful law enforcem ent operations such as DEA'S Operation Mountain E xpress and Operation N orthern S tar targeted importation of ephedrine/pseudoephedrine th rough dom estic organizations operating superlabs in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Riverside and San Diego. The Com bat Metham phetam ine Epidem ic Act of 2005, having passed the House of Representatives in Decem ber 2005, and currently under consider ation in the Senate, would restrict the circum stances and am ounts of sale of ephedrine/pseudo-ephedrine products, set im pact quotas on these substances, and incre ase pen alties f or production and distribution. Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed v On the retail level, m etham phetam ine is a new market in some areas and estab lished m arket in others. In those areas wher e it is relatively new, it is generally produced by local \"cooks\" and distributed in a \"hand to hand\", relational ne twork of people. In areas where the m arket is well established and the dem and is high, more organized networks of producers and distributiors appear to operate. Treatment Metham phetam ine users are seen as som e of th e most difficult drug treatm ent patients, due to protracted physiological and psychological pr oblem s caused by the drug's im pact on neural pathways. Earliest treatm ent approaches were b ased on exp erience with treating co caine users. Current psychosocial approaches incl ude case m anagem ent, community reinforcem ent and the Matrix Model, a m anualized protocol of relapse prevention, cognitive approaches, family thera incen tives. fo r stim ulant users. Several m edications and supportive protocols have been studied in a se ries of NIDA-s upported clinical trials, though no standard pharm acotherapy for m eth treatm ent has yet been finalized. Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed vi Introduction Metham phetam ine m ay be the m ost poorly unde rstood m ajor drug of abuse in the United States, perhaps due in part to its wholly synthetic nature. Many Am ericans can easily connect m arijuana, cocaine and hero in to the plants they are d erived from , but m ost would find it difficult to link m etham phetam ine back to its m ost basic precursor, the Chinese herb Ma Huang, or identify it with its m any ot her precursor form s\u2014ephedra, ephedrine, pseuodephedrine. W hile as dangerous these drugs to the dietary supplem ents, energy enhancers or appetite s uppressants that share the sam e origins. In addition, m ethamphetamine does not have the national profile of m arijuana, opiates, or cocaine. Compared to these substances, m ethamphetam ine is a relatively new drug. It does not appear in historical account s in the United States before the 20th century, and there is no cultu ral tie to its use co mparable to m arijuana' s link to the '60s and ja zz m usicians, heroin's association with W illiam S. Burroughs and beat poetry, or cocaine's his tory with leg al \"tonics\" and Sherlock H olmes. In contras t, metham pheta mine has been prim arily known to some as the favorite drug of m otorcycle gangs, a less than rich cultu ral heritage. Ampheta mines/m ethamphetam ine1 abuse is not new, however. Widely available throughout the 1940s and '50s through prescription, by 1970 ampheta mines alone or in a variety of compounds becam e the most widely abused drug s in the U.S. after m arijuana (Grinsp oon and Hedbloom , 1975). In 1 970, legal p roduction of am pheta mines reached o ver 10 billio n tablets, m any tim es the amount needed for legiti mate medical use. A survey of use among a national sam ple of over 7,000 college students conducted that year found that 11% reported ampheta mine/m ethamphetam ine use (Grinspoon and Hedbloom , 1975). Changing laws and changing drug trends ov er the n ext two decades appeared to effect the virtual d isappearance of these dru gs. However, starting in the 1980s, m ethamphetamine use resurfaced, steadily gathering a following once again. B eginning in Hawaii and the W est, m etham pheta mine becam e increasing ly pop ular, sp treatm ent adm issions from 2% of all treatm ent admissions in 1993 to 7% in 2003 (U.S. DHHS, OAS, 2005) . But these fig ures are deceptive. Metham phetam ine use has b een at ep idem ic stages in som e areas of the country for over a decade, while in others its popularity is confined to smaller subgroups. In California, the proporti on of all the treatm ent adm issions for methamphetamine has gone from 8% to 31% fro m 1992 to 2003; in Arkansas, it skyrocketed from 2% to 22%; and in Iowa the rate we nt from 2% to 22% (U.S. DHHS, OAS, TEDS, 2005) over the sam e time period. 1 Amphetamines are a category of drugs that include dextroamphetamine methamphetamine (Methedrine, c entral nervous system stim ulants. Many data sources do not distinguish between the general category of amphetamine an d methamphetamine, and sim ply com bine them into a general category of am pheta mine-like substances . Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 1 Law enforcem ent is also concerned. Data fr om the National Drug Threat Assessm ent Survey (NDIC, February 2005) of stat e and local law enforcem ent agencies show that 40% of agencies rep ort metham phetam ine as their prim ary drug threat, surpassi ng cocaine (36%), or heroin (9%). The National Association of Counties in 2005 found that 58% of county law enforcem ent agencies su rveyed listed m etham phetam ine as the num ber on drug problem in their areas (NACO, 2005). Cheap, easy to m anufact ure and long acting, m ethampheta mine has becom e a major player in the drug culture. W hile the larg est number of seizures are st ill found in the W est, Midwest, and the South, other areas show marked increases. The num ber of clandes tine lab s seized in the Northwest increased from 94 in 2002 to 143 in 2003 (USDOJ, NDIC, 2005). Ampheta mine/m ethamphetam ine use in the North east, Mid-Atlantic, and som e parts of the South is less common, but is appearing in subpo pulations of users with increasing frequency. The percentage of adm issions to treatm ent for abuse of a mphetam ines/metham pheta mine in Connecticut, Delaware, Washingt on, D.C., Maine, Maryland, New Ha mpshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Verm ont, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York is under 1% of all adm issions (U .S. DHHS, OAS, 2005) , and em ergency room mentions attributable to the drug in cities in many of those sam e areas number less than 10 cases annually (U.S. DHHS, OAS, DAWN, 2004). Powerful stimulant effects and the high potential for profit by distributor s are just two of the reasons m etham pheta mine is as pop ular or m ore popular than cocaine in som e U.S. cities. Difficulty treating m eth addicts and difficulty regulating the precursor chem icals used to manufacture it cha lleng e law enf orcement, treatme nt professionals, and al ready stra ined l and urban resources. This m current inform ation about m etham pheta mine: characteristics of users, treatment approaches, production and tra fficking, and the im pact on law enforcem ent. We draw on a variety of sources: scientific and professional literatu re, published m aterials from Federal and state reporti ng system s, analysis of se veral Federal datasets, and discussions with law enforcem ent and public health providers at all levels of governm ent. In addition, we have reviewed Inte rnet chat room s, visited blog sites, and explored the m any Intern et sites distributin g information that of fer supplies, detail m anufacture, and discuss use. We first tra ce the deve lopment of metham pheta mine, describe trends in use, and exam ine characteristics of users. In Chapter 2, we discuss traffick ing, production, and law enforcem ent efforts, and in Chapter 4, look at the effects of the drug on behavior and health and describe approaches to treatm ent. Chapte r 4 summ arizes our findi ngs and discusses their implications for research and policy and presen ts the cas e of the im pact of m etham phetam ine use on two rural counties. Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 2 Chapter 1: Methamphetamine Use in the United States 1.1 History of Methamphetamine Ampheta mine and m etham pheta mine were drugs or iginally d eveloped a s synthetics to be used as subs titutes for ephedrine, a f ar older, n atural subs tance deriv ed from the herb Ma Haung, or Ephedra, a plant used for centuries for treatm ent of respiratory problem s. The active ingredient in Ephedra, ephedrine, was isolated in the 1880s by Germ an che mists, but not m arketed until the 1 920s, when it was form ulated for use in bronch ial inhalers. Japanese scientists synthesized metham phetam ine in 1919. In 1932, Sm ith, Kline, and French introduced these drugs in over-t he-counter inhalers for asth ma and congestion (Brecher, 1972). In the 1930s, the Am erican Medical Associat ion approved the use of am phetam ines under names like Benzedrine for treatm ent of a ra nge of disorders\u2014narc olepsy, depression, Parkinsons, attention def icit disorder, and al coholism . Other uses soon followed. By 1943, half of m anufacturers' B enzedri ne prescription sales were for we ight control, depression, or simply to stay awake, and new variations on the popular, legal com pounds of a mphetamine and m ethamphetam ine flourished under ove r 100 nam es (Grinspoon and Hedblom , 1975). Its effects on sleep and f atigue were recognized early on. Soldiers and pilots in W orld W ar II were given amphetam ine and m ethamphetam ine to com bat fatigue. In 1940, the Burroughs Wellcom e company introduced m etham pheta mine tablets to commercial m arkets under the name Methedrine, and amphetam ine and m ethamphe tamine were both widely available in the early 1940s. In Japan, use of the injectable form of m ethamphetam ine grew dram atically after WW II supplies u sed by the arm ed forces were releas ed to the m arket at the end o f the war, leading to serious problem s with addi ction. The first Japanese m etham pheta mine epidem ic peaked in 195 4, with up to 2 million people (over 2 % of the total populatio n) using meth intravenously. Meth use continues in Japa n today: in 1998, 90% of all drug arrests in Japan were m ethamphetamine-rela ted (UN General Assem bly, 1998). Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, amphetam ines rem ained readily available in the U.S. The U. S. ar med services continued to use am pheta mines for combat fatigue in the Korean W ar, and U.S. soldiers and pilots in Vietnam us ed am phetam ine and m etham phetam ine to fight combat fatigue. Today the U.S. Ar my and Air Force a llows th e use of stim ulants, inclu ding ampheta mine and m ethamphetam ine, to aviators to com bat the effects of fatigue (NAVMED P-6410, Naval Strike and Air W arfare Center, 2000). A survey of pilots in Desert Storm also indicated substantial (57%) use of stimulants to remain awak e in combat (Emonson a nd Vanderbeek, 1995). Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 3 Civilian use of a mphetam ine and metham phetam ine began to escalate in the late 1950s and early 1960s with its appearance in othe r form s (Dexedrine, Dexa myl, Desoxyn, Biphetam ine), available by prescription and leaked to the illegal m arket. In addition, users began injecting the contents of benzedrine inhalers and liquid m etham phetam ine in ampoules. The 1960s rise in use has often been linked to new distribu tion networks operated by m otorcycle gangs in the U.S. However, until the m id-to-late 1960s m etham phetam ine and ampheta mine were widely used by a broad segm ent of society for a variety of reasons, and available by prescription. Low cost, lengt hy duration of effect and easy access via prescription all contributed to use by wom en for weight loss, truck drivers and college students to stay awake, and by m any users in combination with other drugs like barbiturates and heroin to get high (Miller, 2004). By the 1960s, the am phetam ines, under m any brand nam es and in m any compounds, were part of the g rowing drug cultu re. \"S peed freaks\" becam e a term used to describ ed hig h dose, compulsive users who ingested m etham pheta mine or am phetam ine in large doses, often as much as a half gram in one IV inje ction or two to f our 10 m illigram capsules a t once orally,2 and \"Speed Kills\" entered the lexicon as As m etham phetam ine use rose in the 1960s, the process of drug schedul ization and increased regulation of all drugs w as underway. In 1963 th e State Attorney General of California and the U.S. Departm ent of Justice requested that injectable am poules of amphetam ine products be rem oved from the m arket, leaving intrave nous users with a supply vacuum , and ushering in illicit m anufacture. T he Com prehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and C ontrol Act of 1970 classified amphetam ine/methamphetamine as a Schedule II drug.3 The Act also m ade methamphetamine illegal to possess without a p rescrip tion. Non-injectable form s of m ost ampheta mine products w ere reclassified as Sc hedule II the following year. The 1970s and 80s saw a rapid decline in the use of am pheta mines in m edicine and hence less was diverted to the street. By the m id-1980s the num ber of prescriptions written for amphetam ines had dropped 90% from its pre-legislation level; by 1990, the number had dropped again by a third (Goode, 1999). The relative ease of m etham phetam ine m anufacture and th e absence of co mmercially produced metham phetam ine led to the clande stine production of m ethamphetam ine, and ultim ately to its link with outlaw bike r gangs in California and the Pacif ic Northwest. Biker 2 For comparison , the therapeutic d ose for these dr ugs in tablet form is typ ically 5-10 milligrams. 3 Drugs and drug products that com e under the jurisdiction of th e Con trolled Substance Act are categorized into five sc hedules. Schedule I drugs a re those deem ed as having no acce pted m edical use and high a buse potential (i.e., heroin, marijuana, LSD). Schedule II drugs are those with high abuse p otential, but some medical u tility, and require m edical u se justificatio n and a prescrip tion (i.e., m ethadone, Ritalin ). Th ere are generally no refills an d no telephone prescriptions fo r Sch edule II dru gs. All am phetamines are Sch edule II drugs. Their current medical use i s restricted to the treatment of narcolepsy and minimal brain disorder (MBD) in children in the form of de xtro-amphetamine (M erck, 2004). Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 4 gangs found that speed worked well with their lifestyle, and substantia l profits for production and distribution encouraged them to corner th e market. The m ethamphetamine disbursed via biker distribution networks was predom inantly injectable or in crushable tablet form (Goode, 1999; Miller, 2004). The early m anufacturers of m eth in the U.S. us ed what is called the P2P m ethod, na med after the precursor substance em ploye d, phenyl-2-propanone. This m ethod yields relatively sm all than 10 pounds\u2014of the lower quality dl-m etham pheta mine and, until regulation of this precursor, was the most common illegal production technique. This was the m ethod associated w ith m otorcycle gang pr oduction. Regulation of the precursors used in this m ethod produced a change to the us e of other substances, like ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which result in p roduction of th e higher qu ality d -methamphetam ine. In the early 19 80s, m ethamphetam ine becam e more easily synth esized with the circulatio n of new \"recipes\" or m ethods that were easy to execute. San Diego soon becam e the new methamphetamine hub, and m eth use in Southern California exploded (Miller, 2004). Purer smokable metham phetam ine, or \"ice,\" also gained notoriety in the late 1980s as \"the new crack co caine.\" Many of the prim ary ingredients required to manufacture m etham pheta mine have rem ained legal since illicit labs began ope ration. The Che mical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988 allowed for Federal regulation of som e precurs ors, and the Metham phetam ine Control Act of 1996 strengthened penalties for possession, di stribution, and m anufacturing, as well as tightened controls on precursors. In 2003, ephedrine, the key ingredient in many contem porary m eth recipes, was banned in its pure for m in the U.S under the Ephedra Prohibition Act. Pseudoephedrine, a common ingredient in cold m edicines, has also becom e more tightly controlled. In April 2004, Oklahoma passed the earlies t comprehensiv e to pharm requiring th at products be placed b ehind pharm acy counters, and forci ng buyers to register the sa le with identif icatio n. Many oth er states have followed suit. In 2004, the Illinois began regulating the am ount of pseudoephedrine sold in cold tablets and the num ber of cold m edication packets that can be sold in a single transaction; it also requires that all cold tablets be sold in sealed blister packs (Illin ois Senate Bill 2244, August 24, 2004). Beginning in Novem ber, 2004, Oregon shoppe rs were required to show identification when purchasing over-the-counter cold m edicati ons that contain pseudoephedrine. Indiana has sta rted a retailer edu cation program to help workers identify custom ers who m ight be purchasing multiple p ackages of over-the -coun ter medication s for illicit p urposes.

By the late 1960s, \"speed kills\" becam e part of the national lex icon, and Federal and state law chang ed to lim it access to m anufacturing and distribution of these drugs. The drugs once as popular as m arijuana a nd the hallucinogens of the 1960s, receded in po pularity as a m ajor part of the nation al drug scen e. Beginning in the 1980s, the country saw a reapp earance of the drug beginning in Hawaii and the W est. This spread of m etham phetamine us e from the W est Coast of the United States eastward into the Midwest char acterized the nex t two decades . Its m ovement, however, was slower than early predictions, gradually rising in the W estern states in the 1980s, appearing in Midwestern states in the 1990s, and m aking an appearance in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic only over the past few years. There ar e difficulties loo king at m etham phetam ine trends u sing many of the m ost relia ble national data sources. S ince prevalence of use has been low nationally for years, m any national surveys folded reporting of am pheta mine/m ethamphetam ine into a general category labeled \"stimulants (non-cocaine ),\" making it hard to detect changes in use of individual drugs. Many surveys also com bine am pheta mines and m etham pheta mines in the sam e category, and consequently m ay include illicit use of legal substances like Ritalin, Adderall, or \"diet\" dru gs containin g nationally the inciden ce of metham phetam ine is f ar lower than for drugs such as m arijuana or cocaine, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), that has in recent years developed state level estim ates for m any drugs, doe s not support strong state level methamphetamine/amphetam ine estim ates. Othe r sources of national estimates includ e two surveys of youth, Monitoring the Future (MTF) and the Youth Behavioral Risk Surveillance System (YRBSS), treatm ent adm issions data found in the T reatm ent Episode Data S et (TEDS), e mergency room m entions in th e Drug Abuse W arning Network (DAWN) and urina lysis an d inte rview r esults in th e Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (A DAM) system. Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 6 1.2.2 Self-Reported Metham phetamine Use National Survey on Health (NSDUH) Self-reported lifetim e metham phetam ine use for people age 12 and older has been on the rise in the NSDUH (for merly the National Househol d Survey on Drug Abuse) since 1994 (Figure 1.1), though is still far lower than repo rted use of m arijuana or cocaine.

Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillan ce Syste m (YRBSS) The Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance Syst em (YRBSS) is a source of both national and smaller area estim ates of self-repo rted drug us e of youth. In ad dition to national es timates, YRBSS has provided inform ation for 34 cities /state areas on m ethamphetamine since 1999. As Table 1.2 indicates, between 1999 and 2003, fe w significant trends of m eth use can be detected, though use in som e areas has ch anged significantly. Ve rmont, Montana, and Philadelphia, for exam ple, appear to have sign ificantly d eclining use, while levels in most other s tates/cities are relatively stable. These data are interesting in com parison with that reported for adults in other surveys like NSDU H.

The Treatm ent Episode Data Set (T EDS) repres ents inf ormation gathered from clients at adm each ep isode of treatm ent in prog rams across the country. At intake, program s reco rd basic client characteristic s as well as inform ation about their drug use. TEDS is not a sam ple, but rather an attem pt to get a cen sus of all person s in all publicly funded program s, as well as t hose in treatm ent with private providers participa ting in TEDS. DAWN is a system of da ta abstraction from the records of a nationally representative set of hospitals em ergency departm ents. DAWN provi des area level and ates of the number of em ergency departm ent episodes that involve various drugs and the reason for the visit (poisoning, dependence, etc.). Treatmen t Episode Dataset (TEDS) Reports of treatm ent adm issions for prim ary m eth am phetam ine/amphetamine4 use in the nation accounted for 1% of treatm ent adm issions in 1992 and just over 7.4%, or 135,737 people in 2002 (Figure 1.3). These num bers again m ask the strong regional nature of methamphetamine use. Twenty-one states had levels of use over the national average and 12 states had rates m ore than twice that, or 15% or more of all adm issions (Figure 1.4). For exam ple, Oregon reported that alm ost one-third of all adm issions in that state in 2003 were for m ethamphetam ine/amphetam ine use, a rate that represents a m ore than four-fold increase over the 1992 rate. S tates with a large rural population also figure prom inently in the areas with a high percentage of adm issions for m eth abuse. Heavily rural, Arkansas, Oklahom a, 4 Unfortunately, some states do not report metham phetamine di stinct from amphetamine, so i t is impossi ble to determine the proportion of methamphetamine treatm ent adm issions as a percent age of overall primary treatm ent adm issions . Howe ver, based on a s pecial study of amphetamine treatm ent episodes, SA MHSA estim ates that metha mphetamine for 80% ary a mphetamine treatm ent adm issions (DASIS Re port, 2001). Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 11 Idaho, Utah, Iowa, and Nebraska all report 20 percent or m ore of their adm issions in 2003 cite m ethamphetam ine as the prim ary drug of abus e. This is in sta rk contrast to the s mall methamphetamine num bers for thes e states (3% or less) in 1992. The m ethod of ingestion of m ethampetham ine has changed with the increase in use over the last d ecade. In the early 1990s the mo st comm on m ethods of ingestion were inhalation/snorting (39%) a injection (32%), and onl y 12% of m ethamphetam ine admissions reported sm oking the drug. By 2003, over half of the adm issions listed smoking as the route of adm ission and about 20% of users were injecting.

By 1989, the pr ogram was collecting data in over 20 sites throughout the United States, expanding to 35 sites in 1999. Although the DUF sa mple was one of convenience, the data can at leas t give a rough idea of prevalence rates of methamphetamine use among the arrestee popula tion before 2000. In the year 2000, the DUF program was revamped to include a rigorous sam pling st rategy that supported prevalence estim ates at the county level and was renam ed the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) program . Dat a from 2000 forward give accurate estim ates of the prevalence o f methamphetam ine use in the arrestee populatio n in each co unty. While the data collected prior to 2000 cannot be used to exam ine trends, the rise in the presence of m ethamphetamine among arrestees in th ese years is worth noting. For exam ple, Omaha, Nebraska ur ine screens of arrestees we re virtu ally free of methamphetam ine until the mid-1990s (Figure1.4), when m eth-positiv e UAs bega n to in creas e, risin g to over 20 % of all tests in 2003 . Sim ilarly, San Jose arrestees tested positiv e at rates under 2 0% through out the 1990s; from 2000-2003 the percen t positive ros e from just over 20% to o ver 35%. T he past 2000 trend in all but Portland co ntinued to m ove upward. San Diego, the site with the highest proportion of m eth positives am ong arre stees throughout the 1990s, is now joined by many other sites. By 20 03, eleven s ites repo rted that 25 % or more arrestees tes ted pos itive for m ethamphetam ine use at the time of arres t; for five sites (San Diego, Phoenix, San Jose, Sacram ento, and Honolulu), m ore than 35% of arrestees tested positive for methamphetamine. Arrestees are a unique bellweather of drug use trends. They tend to be th e first and th e heaviest consum ers of illegal drugs, as ADAM/D UF data show. The late 1980s and early 1990s DUF data indicated serious problem s with m eth use in western sites. The problem surfaced in the late 1990 s DUF and early 2000 A DAM data in the South west and Mid-W est sites, no tably more rural areas like O maha and Des Moines. Abt Associate s Inc.

Quest data represent inform ation gathered from tests of workforce employees. Quest Diagnostics report s that its Index is derived fro m over 7.1 m illion urin e screens in 2004 alone.

But ru ral areas in the South and Midwest also have pockets of higher am phetam ine positives, as well as sm all ar eas in the Northeas t. Th is is pa rticularly interesting, as m any other drug use indicators ha ve detected little or no m etham phetam ine use in the Northeast or Mid-Atla ntic states. There are two po ssible exp lanations f or this: eithe r the po sitive test results f or these area s are legal usag e of amphetam ines such as Ritalin or Aderall, not prim arily m eth, or this populati on is not being adequate ly captured in other surveys. Quest data m ay reflect use in th e subpopulations, but not be m etham pheta mine users willing to report in NSDUH, s eeking tr eatm ent (TEDS ), or being arrested (ADAM).

Prior yea r-over-ye ar increases h ave been sign ificantly sm aller between 14% and 17%. Drug test da ta suggest that greater use of methamphetamine among a large group of general U.S. workforce em ployees during 2003 m ay have caused the increase in am phetam ines use overall. For this group of workers, th e incid ence of positive d rug tes ts attributed to methamphetamine increased by m ore than 68% in 2003 from 2002, reach ing 0.32% of all drug tests. During 2002 m etham phetamine positivity was 0.19% (Quest Diagnostics, 2004) . 1.3 Who Uses Methamphetamine? Data sources provide overlapping pictures of metham pheta mine use. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and Monitoring the Future, general p opulation surveys of adolescents and adults, includes both low level users whose use has not reached a stage that put them in contac t with institutions like trea tment or corrections, as well as som e problem atic users who are not in treatm ent, in carcerated or living in a transient situation. The Treatm ent Episode Data Set (T EDS) provides data on persons at a point in their drug use that has prompted treatm ent seeking; this is usually when problem atic use has been estab lished and the use r is either forced or is ready to seek treatm ent. ADAM provides data on what are likely the heaviest users and those w ho have run into trouble with the law. These sources together can provide a pict ure of who uses m ethamphetam ine. From its earliest reputation as a \"biker dr ug\" in the 1960s and 70s, m ethamphetam ine has been associated with W hite, m ale, blue-collar wo rkers. In fact, in its ea rlier inc arnations, ampheta mine com pounds were popular with a range of users\u2014college students, professionals, travelers, dieting subu rbanites, as well as the p erhaps m ore visible biker crowd (Grinspoon and Hedblom, 1975). Who uses metham phetam ine today? Table 1.6 shows the characteristics of adm issions in TEDS for amphetam ine/ metham phetamine, crack cocaine and cocaine. W e includ e inform ation on crack and co caine users for comparison. L ike m ethamphetam ine, cocaine and crack are powerful stim ulants, widely available in certain areas of the countr y. Early in the m ethamphetamine epidem ic in the W est, treatm ent providers and researchers speculated that substitution m ight occur am ong crack or cocaine users with m etham phetam ine or vice versa, as the euphoria generated from cocaine or crack use is sim ilar in nature (albei t shorter) to that found with m etham phetam ine. Given this speculation, we look at cocaine and/or crack user ch aracteristics for indication of crossover or substitution am ong current users of these drugs. Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 18 1.3.1 Gender With the exception of data from the NSDUH, most sources indicate that m etham pheta mine appeals fairly equally to bot h men and wom en. Am ong 12th grad ers reporting in Monitoring the Future (Johnston et al., 2005), the gender sp lit am ong metham pheta mine users is fairly even: 6.6% of m ales and 5.7% of fe males report ever using the drug. Data from TEDS also substantiate the alm ost equal split in term s of gender in 2003: 55% of m etham pheta mine admissions were m en, and 45% were wom en. This differs from the gender split am ong users of other drugs. For example, am ong trea tment adm issions for crack use in 2003, m ales (59%) were som ewhat more frequent adm issions than fe males (41%); for cocaine powder and f or hero in users, the split is ev en more dram atic.

As this shows, both past year and lif etime use is indistinguishable across years. Lifetim e use differences are also difficult to inte rpret as th ey repres ent increased tim e or cum ulative opportunity to have used as the respondent ages. Incidence of recen t use appears to b e similar among adults in this dataset.

It is a drug that does not appear to attract African American users, and has a substantially higher proportion associated with Asian/Pacific Islanders users than either the norm for all adm issions or the proportion asso ciated w ith cocaine, crack, or heroin. Metham pheta mine is also a growing problem among Am erican Indians. Indian Health Serv ices data indicate that the num ber of persons treated for ampheta mine/m ethamphetam ine use at IHS reached 4,000 by Septem ber 2004, double the number treated in 2000 (Murr, 2004). Only a few other drugs show a sim ilar pattern. Am ong the over 12,000 sedative or tranquilizer adm issions in TEDS, over 80% of users are W hite; th e sam e is true for the over 50,000 adm issions for non-heroin opiates (Dem erol, Oxycontin, Percodan, tr eatment adm issions are W hite.

W e have selected sites that have had high levels of m etham pheta mine use (over 30%) for m ore than two years (San Diego, Phoenix) and sites with lower and more recen t metham phetam ine use (Om aha, Oklahom a City ). As this indicates , in both typ es of sites, the profile of users looks similar to that reported in TEDS: users are predom inantly White (over 50% in all but one) and in their 20s and 30s (over 60% in these sites). The racial distribution in San Diego, however, is m ore evenly split be tween W hite and Blacks.

The m ajority of m ethamphetamine user s in all of the selected ADAM sites work full or part tim e and have a high sc hool or better education. In addition, ADAM and TEDS data provide inform ation on whether am phetam ine/ methamphetamine users have sought treatm ent in the past year and/or in their lifetim e. Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 21 Reports from TEDS in 2003 indicate that 50% of the am phetamine/metham pheta mine users report no treatm ent prior to the current one, a nd only 4% had 5 or m ore lifetim e adm issions. This differs som ewhat from treatm ent experience s of cocaine users: on e-third of crack users had no prior adm ission, but 13% of crack user s had 5 or m ore adm issions (USDHHS, OAS, 2005). As Table 2.3 shows, a large nu mber of m eth users in ADAM have past year treatm ent experience. 1.3.5 Use in Subpopulations Research on the drug use of subpopulations ind icates that so me hard to reach or h idden populations are invo lved in m ethamphetam ine use and m ay not appear in trad itional surveys. Studies of the gay and bisexual com munities in two W estern cities (Sem ple, Patterson and Grant, 2002) found that m ethamphetamine is wi dely used in these comm unities and often linked to both unsafe sex and injection practices (Copeland and Sorenson, 2001; Urbina and Jones, al edication for HIV (Reback, Larkins and Shoptaw, 2003) and to the spread of HIV within the m ale gay community (Reback and Ditm an, 1997). This is particularly problem atic given data showing rising seroconversion rates in young gay and bisexual m ales in the 1990s (Shoptaw, Moliter et al., 1998). Metham phetam ine m ay be part of this picture. Studies find that m ethamphetam ine is increa singly used by gay m en to enhance sexual activity and is often found in pl aces like sex clubs and \"circu it parties\" where the potential for multiple partne rs is h igh (Halk itis, Parsons an d Stirr att, 20 04). Qualita tive s tudies report high rates of m eth use associated with unprot ected sex, high risk sexua l activities with m any partners whose serostatus is unknown to the pa rticipant (Semple, Patterson and Grant, 2002). Several studies of convenience sam ples of gay men report over 50% sta ting that they used methamphetamine as part of party activity which was expected to include sexual activity (Halkitis et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003). These findings are particularly alarming gi ven evidence that m ethamphetamine use is associated w ith poor overall health status (Greenwell and Brecht, 2003) , greater prevalence of HIV encephalitis am ong users (Bell et al., 1998) and interf erence with antiretroviral medications, com pliance, and efficacy (Ellis et al. , 2003). Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 22 Chapter 2: Production and Trafficking 2.1. Methods of Methampheta mine Ma nufacture 2.1.1 Sources of Methamphe tamine and Precursors In contrast to essential chem icals used in refin ing coca leaf into cocaine or opium into heroin, precurso r chemicals are used in th e manufacture of synthetic drugs and are part of the final product (U.S. Departm ent of State, 2004). Th e two precursor substances currently m ost often used to m anufacture m ethamphetam ine are pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. E phedrine is a chem ical derivative of the ephedra plan t that grows in China, India, Mongolia, and Pakistan (U.S. DEA 2004a); pseudoephedrine is a chem ical derivative of ephedrine.5 China, India, Germ any, and the Czech Republic are th e prim ary producers of pseudoephedrine; in 2003, 50% of the pseudoephedrine imported into the U.S. was from Germ any, and 71% of the ephed rine was from the Czech Republic (U.S. Census Bureau, 2004). The m ajority of m ethamphetam ine distributed ac ross the U.S. is m ade in super-labs capable of producing 10 pounds or m ore in a 24-hour peri od. This requires larg e-scale indus try crim inal organizations Extraction bronchiodilators, nasal decongestants or energy supplem ents, is thought to be confined to sm all toxic lab (STL) production by independent operators, the \"Mom and Pop\" labs, and a quick trip to the Internet is all that is necessary to find the hundreds of sites offering m ail order purchases of bulk ephedrine or pseudoephedrine tablets. \"Although the sheer num ber of STLs found throughout the United States is gr eater than the num ber of supe r-labs, the latter are actually responsible for the greater sh are of m ethamphetamine being used and distributed throughout our nation\" (U.S. ONDCP, 2004). Fina lly, producers m ay develop nonsynthetic pseudoephedrine ephedra plants or extrac ts sold as stim ulants or in weight loss products. Since the U.S. Food and Drug Adm inistration issued a consum er alert advising consum ers to stop buying and using ephedra pro ducts in 2003 and banned the sale of dietary supplem ents containing ephedrine alkaloids in 2004 (U.S. FDA, 2004), this m ethod is less likely than others. 2.1.2 Methamphe tamine \"Recipes\" Learning to m ake m ethamphetam ine is not diffi cult. There are hundreds of recipes on the Internet for m anufacture, as well as guidebooks to help the be ginner. Such guidebooks, like Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture (Uncle Fester, 2002) -legally published and distributed through routine orderi ng channels, and in its sixth edition-provide recipes, pros and cons of certain m ethods, list equipm ent n eeds, and troubleshoot potential problem s. 5 While these c hemicals are not the sam e, they ha ve a common m olecular structure that m akes them both t he bases for making amphetamine and methamphetamine. Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 23 Even frequently asked questions and advice on converting operations into larger-scale production centers are included. There are tw o general appro aches to production: 1) ex traction or hydrogenation of ampheta mine or m ethamphetam ine from ephedrin e or pseudoephedrine, and 2) synthesis of the drugs from other precursor chem icals. Th e method used by early illicit producers in the 1960s and 1970s involved synthesis of the drug from precursor chem icals. This m ethod typically p roduced 5-10 pounds of metham phetam ine at a tim e. With restrictions placed on these chem icals, new methods involving e phedrine and pseudoephedrine em erged. These methods involve either extrac tion or hydrogenation processes. Today, m ost illicit labs employ this approach, beginning with ephedr ine or pseudoephedrine extracted from pharm aceutical grade products and synthesizing the final p roduct (m ethamphetam ine) in a series of m ixtures and filtering protocol s (Ferguson, 1997). Unlike earlier m ethods of production, today's extraction a nd synthesis involves everyd ay chem icals found in m any household products or, as in the case of anhydr ous ammonia, in farm products, and use precurso rs found in over the counter pharm aceuticals. The chem icals needed for production of m eth using the ephedrine/pseudoephedrine reduction method are ephedrine/pseudoephedrine, hydriodi c acid and red phosphorus. Other chem ical substitutes for hydriodic acid include iodi ne/hypophosphorus acid or anhydrous amm onia and sodium , though the f ormer substitution can produce particularly vol atile gases and has a higher potential for fires or explosions. The older P2P m ethod of production does not use ephedrine/pseudoephedrine but a number other precursor chem and produces dl-m ethamphetam ine. Using one of the processes described above, one of two types of m ethamphetam ine is produced: result of production using the older P2P m ethod and is not as potent as d-m ethamphetam ine which is the result of using the ephedrine/pseudoephedr ine reduction method. It is d- methamphetam ine that is the most commonly found form in current circula tion. \"Ice\" is a for m of metham pheta mine found prim arily in Hawaii that results from crystallizing pow der m ethamphetam ine in a solution lik e methanol or acetone; it is of higher purity than either of the other two form s and is generally sm oked. 2.1.3 Small Toxic Laboratories \"Mom and Pop\" labs or sm all operations can produce m ethamphetam ine easily and relatively cheaply. D EA estim ates that with about $100 of materials, a \"cook\" or m eth manufac turer using the chem icals describe d above can produce about $1,000 worth of the product in a matter of hours (DEA, Congress, 2003). Larger operations (superlabs) rely on diversion of larger quantities of pharm aceutical g rade ephed rine to avoid the need to rem ove i mpurities (coloring, ad ditives) o r in other ag ents found in som e pseudoe phedrine tab lets or other over the counter m edications. Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 24 \"Mom and Pop\" labs are referred to as sm all toxi c labs, or ST Ls, and are more prolific in the U.S. than larger superlabs, but are not thought to produce the bulk of retail methamphetamine. Sm all labs by definition ar e those producing less th an 10 pounds of m eth in a production cycle. H owever, as the nam e implies, STLs are dangerous to the lab operator, neighbors, and law enforcem ent. Thes e labs are temporary, mobile, and difficult to detect, as chem icals used in production are ea sy to obtain, and the profit m argin m akes the risks accep table to m eth \"cooks.\" According to the DEA, \"The growin g use of the Intern et, wh ich provides access to m etham phetamine \"recipes,\" coupled with increasi ng dem and for high-purity product, has resulted in a dram atic in creas e in th e number of mom and pop laboratories in the United S tates. In 2001, the numbe r of labs with capacities under ten pounds totaled over 7,700.\" (U.S DEA, 2003). There are literally thousands of these sm all opera tions. Meth lab seizur es have been reported in the 46 states, from around 6,700 in 1999 to over 10,000 in 2003. In recent years, seizures have declined som ewhat in the W est and Northw est, and incr eased subs tantially in So uthwest and Midwest. Even in the Northeast, seiz ures increased from 94 to 143 from 2002 to 2003. Mom and Pop labs represent the largest propo rtion of labs seize d\u201492% of the over 10,000 seizures in 2003 (USDOJ, NDTA, 2005). This is particularly the case in the new expansion areas of the South, Midwest, and Northeast. Most operating labs are sm all producers, with low production capacity using local supplies. These operators use extraction m ethods that can be m astered by an indivi dual with little background in chem istry.

Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 25 Metham phetam ine itself is the final and least hazardous substance involved in STLs. By- products of the production process are often ex tremely toxic and affect all who com e in contact with them , not only the m anufacturer . It is estim ated that one pound of methamphetamine produced in a clandestine lab results in the pr oduction of 5-6 pounds of hazardous w aste (Sco tt, 2002). These waste pr oduct chem icals can rend er the farm land, forests (in o ne case ev en a nation al forest campground) useless until hazm at (hazard ous materials) team s can clean the area (USDA, 2002; Snell, 2002; Scott, 2002). In m any states, the property owner, even if not involved in the illegal activ ity, can be held financially responsible for the cleanup, which can cost $5-$10,000 per site. In Oregon, prospective buyers and tenants m ust be inform ed about re sidences which form erly housed a m eth lab, and the possible hazards listed on the property title (Peck, 2004). Environm ental effects are not lim ited to the immediate area of the lab. Areas where m eth labs are often found in agricultural regions, forests, and ranchland locations that are particularly vulnerable to toxic waste runoff. U.S. Forest Se rvice officers have enco untered tree \"kills\" in areas surrounding STLs, and ranchers in Arizon a have reported suspicious cattle deaths in areas downstream from labs (Snell, 2002). Californi a's Central Valley, hom e to both superlabs and ST Ls, is also one of th e world's m ost productive agricultural regions. These hazards are also reflected in injuries to responding law enforcemen t officers, reports of which alm ost doubled from 2002 to 2003 (USDOJ, NDTA, 2005). The seizure of s mall toxic labor atories is a significant resource drain for all public saf ety agencies inv olved. W hether the lab is suspected and raided by investigators or encountered by acciden t in the course of an operation, fi rst resp onders and p olice agencies require equipm ent and training (Scott, 2002). Herm etically sealed hazm at suits, licensed contractors, and enough training to safely process a m eth lab are expensive and resources are often limited in lo cal law enforcem ent agencies. Annu al cos ts for lab cleanup s by DEA for predom inantly m eth operations increased from $2 m illion ten y ears ago to o ver $16 m illion in 2003 (NDTA, 2005). 2.2 U.S. and Global Markets fo r Methamphetamine and Precursor Chemicals 2.2.1 Sources of Methamphe tamine and Precursors Metham phetam ine found in the U.S. is typically p roduced do mestically o r in Mex ico. Until recen tly, Canada was a prim ary source of divert ed pseudoep hedrine and ephedrin e. Mexican drug trafficking organizations produce m ethamphetam ine using large-scale labs based in Mexico and the U.S. Southwest, dominati ng since 1994 the older U.S. m etham pheta mine distribution that had been car ved out by regional outlaw m otorcycle gangs and other sm all- scale producers (U.S. DEA 2003a). Heavy Mexican participation is evident in those areas of the highest and m ost long-standing use and thought to be linked to Mexico's greater availability of bulk quantities of ephedrine/pseu doephedrine from China. Som e of the labs were found over the last few years in investigati ons into Mexican production are ones able to Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 26 produce m any hundreds of pounds of Meth in a single production cycle (USDOJ, NDTA, 2005). The U.S. Sentencing Comm ission found that twice as m any Federal methamphetamine cases between FY1992 and FY1998 involved Hispanic noncitizens than Hispanic citizens, and M exican natio nals ac counted for 93% of noncitizen m etham phetam ine traffickers. The num ber of states con victing Mexican nationals grew from three s tates in FY1992 to 30 states in F Y1998 (U.S . Sentencing Comm ission 1999). Limitations in the av ailability of precursor ch emicals have produced i nnovations to the m eth market. Methylsulfonylm ethane (MSM), a diet ary supplem ent for both hum ans and horses, is som etimes found in metham phetam ine produ ced by Mexican crim inal organizations. MSM is added during the production process, reducing the purity of the final product and increasing profitability. Unlike som e of the other chem icals used in production, MSM is readily available and unregulated. In part due to this product, larg er manufacturers have significantly reduced purity sin ce the m id-1990's, with levels falling to just over 40% in 2001, down fro m nearly 72% in 1994 (ONDCP, 2003). Law enforcem ent sources also report that sm all num bers of independent m eth producers have begun producing anhydrous ammonia them selves, ra ther than relying on stolen or illicit supplies. T his chem ical is the p recursor m ost frequently inte rdicted by la w enf orcement (U.S. DOJ, NDIC, 2004), and law enforcem ent efforts have made it harder to find or steal from local farm operations. Historically, precurso rs were smuggled to c lande stine labs p rimarily located in the Southwest, but current distribut ion is m ore geographically dispersed. According to D EA's National Clandestine Laboratory Se izure System , which m aintains data on U.S. lab seizures by local, state, and Federal law enforcem ent, W estern lab seizures have actually declined (U.S. DEA, undated). A s shown in Figure 2.1, lab seizures in the W est dropped from 4,073 to more than half as m any (1,810) between 1999 and 2003. In contrast, lab seizures in the South doubled (1,280 to 2,676), and lab seizures in the Midwest nearly doubled (1,424 to 2,534). W hile there are very few lab seizures in the Northeast, they have increased from 4 in 1999, to 30 in 2003, indicating aspects of a problem rolling East. Abt Associate s Inc.

However, m etham pheta mine seizures in the West have declined from about 80 to 60 per 100,000 adult populati on (see Figure 2.3). Seizures in the Midwest and South rem ain below 20 item s per 100,000, but have generally increased. As docum ented by lab and drug seiz ures, m ethamphetam ine has not im pacted the Northeast as it has other U.S. regions.

As expected , California had the high est num ber of seizures at nearly 700 kg annually until a decrease to 490 kg in FY2002 (see Figure 2.4). Texas seizures fluctuated between 263 kg and 561 kg; Arizona seizures increased from 60 kg to over 300 kg; and New Mexico seizures remained low, fluctuating between 10 kg a nd 40 kg. FY2003 figures indicate 40% of all seizures were m ade in Arizona, an area which historically has been less ac tive than oth er border states like California or Texas (U.S. DEA 2003b).

Each of these data sources points to the gr adual move ment of production (and presum ably use) eastward, though the epicen ter rem ains stable, but firm ly fixed, in the W est. Drug purity also varies re gionally, suggesting different production and traf ficking organizations and/or m ethods. According to prelim inary 2003 data from DEA's Special Testing and Research Lab, m etham phetam ine seizures are 48% pure on average nationally, but 83% pure am ong Southwest border seizures and 56% pure in the Northeast (U.S. DEA 2003a). Mexico-produced m ethamphetam ine, which m ost likely com prises Southwest border seizures, has the highest purity; purity m ay decrease as it is \"cut\" and m oves further from the border. 2.2.2 Production in Superlabs Although metham phetam ine is produced throughout the United States, C alifornia is the only state where production reaches \"sup erlab \" distin ction, with som e excep tions in the central U.S. (Figure 2.5). Superlabs, or labs capable of producing te n pounds or more of methamphetamine, are believed to be the source of most of the m eth produced in the United States (NDIC, 2005). Most s uperlabs are controlled by Califo rnian or Mexican crim inal groups located in California. Four S outhern California counties accounted for over 40% of the superlabs seized in 2003 (USDOJ, NDTA, 2005). Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 31 ___________________________________________________________________________ Figure 2.5 Source : U.S. Depar tment of Justic Clandest ine Laborator y Seizure S ystem as of March 9, 2004. ___________________________________________________________________________ The Inland Narcotics Clearinghouse (INCH), loca ted at the R iverside County Sheriff' s Departm ent Special Investigations B ureau and a com ponent of the Los Angeles High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) , estimates that in 2000 in Riverside and San Bernadino C ounties alone m ethamphetam ine la boratories had a production capability of 44.6 metric tons. This exceed s the 3.87 metric tons reported seized to the Fed eral Drug Seizure System by a ll Federal agencies in 2000 by 172% (NDIC, 2002). 2.2.3 Methamphe tamine and International Trafficking Metham phetam ine presents a diverse and global problem , and U.S. m arkets are inex tricab ly linked to international drug organizations. Re gardless of whether the final m etham phetamine product is made dom estically, m any precursor ch emicals are not produced in North Am erica, and m ust be obtained from foreign sources. It is a highly m obile a nd profitable m arket, and frequently used crim organiza tions with m oney launde ring capabilities. \"Trafficking organizations find synthetic drug production (especially m etham pheta mine) attractive for several reasons: there is no dependence on growing seasons; no large workforce is required; necessary chem icals are e asily ob tained; it is ea sy to locate laboratories near consum er markets; and there is a high profit return on their investm ent\" Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 32 (U.S. DEA, 2003b: 2). Unlike m arijuana, co caine and hero in, m etham phetam ine production cannot be countered with crop er adication or source identifica tion m ade by tracing signature elem ents back to geographic origin. The nece ssary m eth precursors do not dete riorate with time, and can be rerouted to m obile labs upon detection of trafficking routes. The supplies of precursors, notably ephedrin e and pseudoephedrine tablets used by the m any small Mom and Pop labs , trad itionally com e from gathering s mall supplies of blister p ack cold m edications in m ultiple pharm acy buys or ordering ephedrine tablet s over the Internet. Large dom estic producers have used bulk supplie s of tablets obtained from Canadian, Middle Eastern, Mexican or Far Eastern courses. Recent efforts at the Canadian b order and stronger enforcem ent of regulations on Canadian production have helped to lim it diverted tablets from that sou rce. As a result law enforcem ent sources report increased seizures of Asian pseudoephedrine tablets in California destin ed for super labs in that region. The highest num ber of ephe drine seizures in 2000/2001 was reported by China (10,150 in 2000), followed by Burm a (3,922) and India (930). As shown in Figure 2.6, China (45%) had the highest num ber of m ethamphetam ine se izures of those surveyed by the UNODC in 2001, followed by Thailand (27%) and the U.S. (12%). The U.S is only one of several world m arkets fo r methamphetamine. It is used in Europe, East and So utheas t Asia, and m ore recently Au stralia. The highest m ethamphetam ine abuse level reported worldwide is in Thailand, where it is used by 5.6% of the population aged 15 to 64 (UN Office on Drugs and Crime, 2003). Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 33 Figure 2.6 Repor t Seizu res of Me thamphetamine by Countr 001 UNODC Annual Reports Qu estio nnaire Data (UN ODC 2003). The m ain source of am phetam ine type stim ulants is Burm a (Myanm ar), which has no chem ical industry, but obtains precursors produced in India, China, and Thailand (U.S. DEA 2003b). Burm a produces in excess of 800 m illion metham phetamine tablets (Ya-Ba) annually. T he insurgent group, United W ay Stat e Arm y, is the prim ary producer. Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand produce lower volum es. An estim ated 80 % of these are consum ed in Thailand, som etimes shipped through Laos; the remainder end up in Australia, Brunei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore , Taiwan, and Vietnam . \"The re is no reliable seizure data on Burm a-produced tablets entering the United States\" (U.S. DEA, 2003b: 3), only when m ethamphetam ine shipm ents to California are detected. The Mini stry of Health of Burma has issued a notification th at prohibits the im port, sale or use of precursors, and has agreed on cross-border cooperation among Mekong ri ver subregion countries, but the country has no laws or regulations con cerning chem ical control. Along with India, China is a m ajor producer of ephedra and a lead ing exporter of bulk ephedra (U.S. DEA, 2004c). These precursor s are used in th e manufacture of crystal methamphetamine, which is trafficked by or ganized crim e groups based in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan. China is the prim ary producer and consum er of crystal methamphetamine; smaller quantities are produced in Philippines, Taiwan, and South Korea. Most of the crystal m etham pheta mine produced is consum ed locall y, and these countries consider crystal m ethamphetam ine abuse a m ajor drug problem, second to heroin/opium. However, cargo bound for international m arkets have been seized in southern China ports, Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 34 indicating som e exports. Other consum er markets include: A ustralia, Brunei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singa pore, South Korea, Taiwan, the Marianas Islands, and the U.S. (especially Guam and Hawaii). Reports on crystal m etham pheta mine seizures have fluctuated from 1.3 m etric tons in 1995 to 20.9 metric tons in 2000; seizures reported between 2001 and 2003 are below 5 m etric tons (U.S. DEA, 2004c). While outlaw m otorcycle gangs still dom inate dom estic m etham pheta mine production in Australia, ethnic organized crim e groups in that country do trade m ethamphetam ine among them selves (U.S. DEA, 2004d). In 2003 Cust oms seized pseudoephedrine shipm ents from Cambodia and crystal metham phetam ine ship ments involving ethnic Chinese organized crime groups. DEA Canberra reports m etham phetamine seizures have risen from 8.81 kg in FY2000 to 244 kg in FY2003. Australia is not a major drug or source country, but it does represent a transit point along m aritim e and av iation routes between Southeast Asia and the Americas, as well as a m arket. Australian drugs of choice are m arijuana, Ecstasy and methamphetamine, in that order (U.S. DEA, 2004d). New Zealand also reported m any seizures of pseudoephedrine and m etham pheta mine in 2003 (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crim e, 2004). 2.2.4 Chemical Diversion and Control A need for com prehensive chem ical controls \u2014not only drug laws\u2014was first recognized during a series of intern ational conferences held in the 1980s , and culm inated in Article 12 of the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Il licit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Vienna C onvention; RCMP and U.S. DEA, 2001). Effective with the Vienna Convention, parties ac cept the obligation to enact laws and regul ations to control chem ical commerce and prevent d iversion to illicit drug m anufacture. T he UN Comm ission on Narcotic Drugs m eets annually to review goals and update the surveillance list of chem icals and source co untries. For exam ple, the m embers mandated a C hemical Action Task Force at the 1990 Econom ic Summ it, and recomm ended additional chem icals to the original Vienna Conventi on list (RC MP and DEA, 2001). As stated previously, while m any U.S. traffickers extract pseudoephedrine from nonprescription over the counter m edications for m ethamphetamine production, the more common m ethods involve dive rsion in bulk from legitim ate chem ical production or commerce to illicit drug m anufact ure. W hile other countries ha ve worked with the U.S. in targeting precursor and m ethamphetamine traffi cking through the UN and other joint efforts, they often lack the neces sary chem ical contro l regulations and enfor cement resou rces. The most susceptible countries are them selves, or proxim ate to, drug pr oducing countries, have weak im port/export and border controls, and do no t verify end-use or respond to pre-export notifications (U.S. Departm ent of Sta te, 2004). Where regulated, export ing countries require a perm it from the im porting country to verify a chem ical product transaction is legitim ate. Some use the Letter of No Objection m ethod, by which exporting countri es require a letter stating there is no objection from the importi ng country before allowing above-threshold Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 35 transactions to proceed (RCMP and U.S. DEA, 2001). Still, the challenge is to im plem ent chem ical controls and monitoring system s without jeopardizing legitim ate comm erce. In the U.S., pseudoephedrine and other precurso rs used to m anufacture m ethamphetamine are List I chem icals under Federal law. Manufacture, im portation, and exportation are regulated by DEA, which engages in the Letter of No Obje ction Program. In 1988, the Chem ical Diversion and Trafficking Act instituted a regulatory and en forcem ent fr amework for precurso r control that allows DEA to determ ine legitim ate chem ical use of i mport/export declarations in the U.S. DEA and chem ical diversion investigator s assist INTERPOL and other countries in determ ining legitim ate end-us e, with enforcem ent assistan ce fro m the U.S. Custom s and Border Protection. Precursor control was further enhanced by the Crim e Control Act of 1990, whi ch added precursor chem icals to the Controll ed Substances Import and Export Act. The Dom estic Chem ical Diversion Control Act of 1993 targeted methamphetamine specifically by placing over the counter ephedrin e and other products under DEA regulatory control, a nd requiring registration of List I chem ical handlers. In 1996, Congress passed the Com prehensive Metham pheta mine Control Act, which broadened all controls of chem icals used in controlled substances production and increased penalties for m etham phetamine m anufacture an d trafficking of both listed chem icals and methamphetamine itself. Congress passed the Metham phetam ine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000 to address the diversion of drug products containing pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolam ine from retail and m ail orde r sources by reducing the thresholds for regulated transactions of over the counter (U.S. DEA, undated c). 2.2.5 Regulating Chemicals in Other Co untries In 1995, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police es tablished the National Chem ical Precursor Diversion Program to encourage voluntary reporting and coo peration by the chem ical industry (RCMP and U.S. DEA, 2001). Canada passed thei r own Controlled Drugs and Substances Act of 1997, which identified nine precursor chem icals. Various governm ental organizations, including Health Canada and the C ustom s and Revenue Agency, worked to place p recursors on the Export Control List in 1992; this req uired perm its for export of above-threshold quantities of pseudoephedrine/E. Canada also issued Letters of No Objection, b ut thes e were issued to the industr y importer, who subm itted the letter with their purchase order to the foreign supplier. The le tter m ethod had no legal basis, but was offered as a courtesy to the industry a nd to encourage tracking. All of th ese m easures failed to affect precursor diversion because they lacked regul atory or adm inistrative controls and thus chem ical trade was weakly m onitored (RCMP and U.S. DEA, 2001). After several years' developm ent, the Controlled Drug and Subs tances Act of 2003 established regulated chem ical control by Health Canada and enfo rcement by RCMP. It prohibits the im port, export, and possession f or export of precursors so ld in quantities above threshold except by licen sed dealers; Class A precurso rs and their thresholds inclu de acetic an hydride (10 00 kg), ephedra (20 gm per package), ephedrine (400 m g per package), and pseudoephedrine (3 gm Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 36 per package)\u2014all essential com ponents of methamphetam ine (National Association of Pharm acy Regulatory Authorities, 2003). Other source and drug producing countries have had m ore difficulty regulating and enforcing chem ical control and impacting m etham phetamine production and distribution. As summarized in the late st Intern ational Narcotic s Control Strategy Report (U.S. Departm ent of State, 2004): Mexico has estab lished a Chem ical Sensitiv e hedrine from Hong Kong and other Far East countries. India has ch emical control laws th at include pseudoephedrine , respond to requests for approval and end-use verifica tion (especially regarding pseud oephedrine ), and cooperate with the DE A diversion investigato r in New Delhi. China will n ot allow pseudoephedri ne export without affirm ation by the im porting country's authorities\u2014either by permit or Letter of No Obj ection. However, significant amounts of pseudoephedr ine are expo to M exico, and recen t pseudoephe drine seizu res in the U.S. and Panam a destined for Mexi co were traced to legitim ate Hong Kong pharm aceutical com panies. The con trol unit verifies chem ical handlers and trans action s, with assistance f rom DEA in Beijing and Hong Kong, but the country lacks infrastructu re to adequately m onitor the volum inous chem ical production and international trade. Penalties for drug trafficking are severe; sentences for the seizure of 50 gra ms of cr ystal m etham phetam ine m ay include the death penalty. European Union chem ical diversion control re gulations bind all m ember states, but these are ind ividually im plemented and en force d. Regulations have transaction record, import/export perm its and declaration, and sh ipment suspension provisions. Germ any and the Netherlands are m ajor source countries of diverted chem icals (the Dutch trade is in MDMA). Germ any's Precursor Control Ac t of 1994 crim inalized chem ical diversion, and the Federal Police an d Germ an Custom s form the Join t Precursor Che mical Unit that is devoted to investigatio ns and cooperates with DEA's Frankfurt office. 2.2.6 U.S. Federa l Law Enforcement and Prosecution In addition to its own offices (EPIC, Special Testing and Research Laboratory, and F ield Divisions), DEA leads several ongoing colla borative efforts toward precursor and methamphetamine control: Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 37 Since 1990, High Intens ity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTAs) have ins titutionalized team work between local, state and F ederal efforts to reduce drug trafficking in over 30 U.S. regions. Operation P ipeline is a N ationwide highway interdiction program created in 1984 to train, aid communications, and provide an alytic support to state and local law enforcem ent in dete ction of drug traf ficking using private m otor vehicles. Operation Convoy was created in 1990 to target drug tr afficking in com mercial vehicles, using surveillance undercover and ot her law enforcement activities at truck stops, transshipm ent areas, and m otels (U.S. DEA, unda ted b). Operation T opaz, started in 2001 coordinate s international strategy targeting anhydrous ammonia. Operation P rism is a voluntary a nd multilateral initiative s tarted in 2003 to track and prevent th e diversi on and trafficking of che micals and equipment used in ATS manufacture in m ajor source coun tries. Both inv olve the UN Intern ationa l Narcotics Control Board (U.S. ONDCP, 2002). The Organized Crim e Drug Enforcem ent Task Force (OCDETF) led by DEA's Special Operations Division, comprises: agents and analysts from DEA, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal R evenue Service, Bureau of I mmigration and Custom s Enforcem ent, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacc o, Firearm s and Explosives; and atto rneys from the Justice Depa ision U.S. Attorney's ha s been respo nsible for O peration ME TA (started in 1997, resu lting in 121 arrests of th e Am ezcua-Contrera g roup in Mexico), Operatio n Mountain Express (see below), and other investigations involvi ng m oney laundering, weapons, and sm uggling. The Com bat Metham phetem ine Epidem ic Act of 2005, having passed the House of Representatives, is under consideration in th e Senate at this writing. Th is act would reclassify pseudoephedrine, ephedrine a nd PPA to Schedule Listed Chem icals and reduces the transaction lim it from 9 gram s to 3.6 gram s per purchase. It also requires behind the pharm acy counter storage and written verification of purchase. Internet sellers of the products would be covered under the same restrictions. The law also sets production quotas for the three target s ubstances, though there is little domestic production of these products. The law, howev er, would also set im port quotas on these substances. Finally, the le gislation enhances crim inal penalties for production and distribution, including penalt ies for child endangerm ent. These efforts have had substantial impacts on trafficking and production practices. Unfortunately, crim inal organizations are able to circum vent regulations and enforcem ent by shifting reso urces and n etworks. W hen DEA's Operation Mo untain Express (Phase s I and II) succeeded in curtailing diversion of pseudoephe drine from dom estic ind ustry, traffickers focused on Canadian sources (U.S. DEA, 2003c ). DEA then engaged the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for Operation Mountain Expr ess Phase III to target im portation of Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 38 pseudoephedrine from Canada for illegal m anufacture of m etham pheta mine in the U.S. Middle Eastern drug organizations used brokers in Detroit, Chicago, Cincinnati, and L A to smuggle pseudoephedrine from Canada through Detroit for distribution to Mexican drug organizations operating superlab s in Phoenix, Las Vegas, LA, Riverside, and San Diego. Collectively , Operation Mountain E xpress Phas es I-III resu lted in over 3 00 arres ts, and seizure of 9 clandestine labs, over 30 tons of pseudoephedrine, 181 lbs of m ethamphetamine, and over $1 6 million U SD (U.S. DEA, 2002b). DE A's Operation Northern Star (considered Phase IV) targeted continued il legal im portation of pseudoephedrine from Canada to the US, ranging from precursor suppliers, chem ical broke rs, transporters, m anufacturers, distributors, and m oney l aunderers (U.S. DEA, 2003c). Fi nally, Canada passed the Drug and Substances Act of 2003 and decreased diversion of pseudoe phedrine to the U.S. The U.S. no longer considers Canada a m ajor source of pseudoephedr ine used in dom estic illicit m anufacture of methamphetamine (RCMP, 2004). Now Mexico and other drug producing countries are diverting pseudoephedrine from alternative sources. As noted, recen t pseudoephedrin e seizures destined for Mexico were traced to legitim ate Hong Kong pharmaceutical companies (U.S. DEA, 2004c). Pseudoephedrine and other precursors used to manufacture m ethamphetamine are List I chem icals, and unlawful distributing, im porting, exporting, or possessing a listed chem ical is a Federal crim e (U.S.C. \u00a72D1.11). Metham phetam ine is regulated by D EA as a Schedule II narcotic, and unlawful m anufacturing, im porting, e xporting, or trafficking is a Federal crim e (U.S.C. \u00a72D1.1). The U.S. Sentencing Comm ission (1999) found that Federal cases involving m etham phetam ine had tripled from 630 in FY1992 to 2,234 in FY1998. Just over 20% of all m ethamphetamine cases involve d a weapon. In FY2002, 2,171 Federal cases related to m etham phetam ine were fi led against 4,208 defendants, in addition to approxim ately 100 m ajor m etham phetamine lab cases (ONDCP, 2004). Penalties and quantity triggers have changed over tim e: Following the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, the initial Federal Sentencing Guidelines (effective 19 87) assign ed to m etham phetam ine an equivalent of twice that of cocaine. Congress established m andatory m inimums for m ethamphetamine in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 as 10 pure gram s trigge ring 5 years m inimum prison, and 100 pure gram s triggering 10 years m inimum prison. In the Crim e Control Act of 1990, Congress focused on crystal m etham phetamine, which was typically over 80% pure and raised addiction concerns. The 1991 Federal Sentencing Guidelines treated \"ic e\" as 100% pure m ethamphetam ine. In response to the Com prehensive Meth ampheta mine Control Act of 1996, the 1997 Federal Sen tencing Guid eline s were am ended to add enhance ments f or illegal methamphetamine or chem ical im portation a nd for related ental offenses. Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 39 The Methamphetam ine Trafficking Enhan cement Act of 1998 increased m andatory minimum penalties by ha lving th e associated m inimum quantity of pure methamphetamine\u20145 gram s for 5 years prison, and 50 gram s for 10 years prison, making the quantity triggers consistent with tho se for crack cocaine. The Methamphetam ine Anti-Proliferation Ac t of 2000 raised the sentencing guideline level for m etham pheta mine m anufacturing offenses that risk harm to others. Currently, Federal m etham pheta mine traffickin g carries m inimum penalties of five years prison, and f ines of $2 million for ind ividuals (or $4 m illion, if not an individual), for first offenses involving under 50 pure gram s. These are doubled f or second offenses or offenses involving larger am ounts. The m aximum penalty is life im prisonm ent for two or m ore prior offenses. Penalties m ay change with the le gislation currently under review in Congress. 2.3 Methamphetamine Retail Markets There are a num ber of factor s that affect a reta il drug m arket: whether it is produced domestically, its m aturity , and law en forcem ent policy. Drug s that ar e imported by definition have a \"deeper\" or m ore tiered distribution sy stem. Heroin and cocaine, for exam ple, are agricultural products, grown abroad, that need to be harvested, pr ocessed at several junctures, shipped, and eventually packaged for different leve ls of distribution (whole sale to the stree t). These m any steps involve m any people at different levels of the ch ain: growers, extractors or producers, transporters or sm ugglers distri butors and the myriad number of m iddlem en or assistants needed to m ove product across borders before it gets to the custom er. Metham phetam ine also differs from other drugs of abuse in fundam ental ways that af fect the retail m arket. The geographic distribution of meth markets is one of their most distinguishing features. Many urban m arkets like Philadelphi a, New York, Chicago, Miam i, awash in illegal drugs like cocaine, heroin or marijuana, h ave little m ethamphetam ine. Even in areas that do have high levels of m ethamphetamine use, the m eth markets and laboratories are often found in outlying vici nities rather than in the more populous urban centers. Many studies of trafficking in co caine and heroin have shown that it is generally only at the tail end of the dist ribution chain of thes e drugs that you find a user or consum er. Metham phetam ine, by contrast, is a drug synt hesized from several possible precursor chem icals, most dom estically available. Us ing widely accessible re cipes, cooks produce methamphetamine in s mall lots (Mom and Pop labs) for personal use or distribution, or in larger lots (in superlabs) for wider sales. The need for depth or specialization in the organiz ation is les s acute with m ethamphetam ine than for other drugs. Also, unlike other distribution organizations, the meth producer (par ticularly in s maller opera tions) is qu ite often a consum er. The m aturity of a m arket also effects its form : how long has the drug been around; how many peopl e know how to produce and sell it; how bi g is the dem and? If use can be seen as Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 40 an indication of the history or m aturity of a market, there are retail m ethamphetam ine markets at varying degrees of m aturity across the country, with the m ost established located in the W est and the new est in the Midwest and som e areas of the South. Law enforcem ent policy also affects m arket activity through local disruption and/or heightened scrutiny. Urban areas often have specia l task forces assigned to com bat or disrupt particular markets. Rural areas often with onl y a handful of officers ha ve far fewer res ources to deal with drug use or sales. In these le ss well-staffed areas , markets may also hav e more privacy or room to develop. Data from the 35 ADAM sites help characteri ze local m ethamphetam ine sales at the retail level. The se data ind icate that the metham phetam ine retail m arket (as d escrib ed by arres tee users) is dif ferent than th e retail m arket f or other drugs like crack or heroin. Heroin, for exam ple is a \"cash\" m arket in those areas wher e it is available. In Chicag o and New York, over 60% of transactions for heroin are m ade in cash only, rather than bartered, given away, or exchanged for services. The sam e is true to a lesser ex tent for crack co caine. In co ntras t, ADAM data indicate that m ethamphetam ine transact ions in all but a handful of sites are less likely than crack transactions to be \"cash only.\" In sites as dif ferent geographically as San Diego, Salt Lake City and Minneapolis, crack transactions are twice as like as m eth transaction to be cash only. Meth sales are also more likely to be m ade indoors. By contrast, crack in m ost ADAM sites has a substantial outdoor sales m arket: over 60% of crack purchases in San Jose and over 50% in Seat tle, P ortland, Minneapolis and New York are outdoor purchases. Only one site (P ortland) reports higher than 30% outdoor m eth purchases. Om aha is an interesting exam ple of this phenom enon. Both crack and m eth are activ ely tran sacted in Om aha. Om aha's crack sales reported by arrestees occur outside over 30% of the tim e, com pared to their m eth sales that occur ou tside less th an 10% of the tim e. Though sim ilar drugs, crack and m eth are like ly bought and used by di fferent populations of users. We can also look at how active the m arket is in term s of how m any dealers are available for sales. ADAM sites with both m eth and crack sa les show that crack us ers are involved with more differe nt dealers th an m eth users. In Sacram ento, arres tees report that on average they obtained m eth from just over two dealers in the last 30 days; crack users report they obtained from , on average, over four d ealers in the last 30 days (H unt and Kuck, 2004). Many other sites with established m eth use (San Diego, Phoenix, Portland) have sim ilar data. The dominance of indoor or non-public transactions, involving fewer dealers suggests that, rather than an organized cash driven business, it is one in which users and even producers are selling to friends and acquaintances rather th an to strangers. A study done in the early 1990s in San Diego (Eck, 1998) reported the sam e resu lts. Crack and cocaine were m ore likely to be open m arket transactions and m etham pheta mine markets were m ore likely to be enclosed or indoor, private transactions. In a study of metham phetamine in both urban an d rural counties of Nebraska, Herz (2000) found that use was m ore common in rural areas of the county than in urban Om aha, but that Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 41 the drug was widely available in both areas and obtained thro ugh friends, fa mily m embers or acquaintances. There w ere also significant di fferences between urban and rural areas as to percentage of arrestees reporting that they ever sold m etham phetam ine. There were almost twice as m any sellers in som e rural c ounties. There were, however, no significant differences in the num ber of persons who reported producing methamphetamine in urban or rural counties (from 9% to 12% of arrestees). Ethnographic data on m etham pheta mine supports th e picture of the m eth market as m ore relational, as non-cash and rely ing m ore on associations rath er than having a basis in organized street sales, as is often found w ith crack or heroin. Data from ethnographic sources in a special report on drug m arkets (ONDCP, 2002) indicate that independent or smaller selle rs sell lo cally produced m eth in residential locations or hotels, while m ore organized sellers handle Mexican or out of area produced m eth and operate in m ore open or public s elling areas. Law enforcement sources c ited in th is report also n ote tha t disrupting the m eth market is difficult, because it is a relational \"hand to hand\"(ONDCP, 2002: 60) market accessed through personal introduction or through beepers and cell phones am ong acquaintances. While som e large cities r eport con centrated selling locations, most areas describ e multiple selling locales in urban, suburban and rural area s. In a study of six cities' m etham phetamine problem s and initiatives, The Office of Comm unity Oriented Policing Services found that labs seized by police were found with sim ilar frequency in vehicles , residences, storage lockers and hotels/m otels. Many of the labs seiz ed were what they term ed \"boxed labs,\" or highly m obile sets of chem icals and equipm ent producing relatively sm all am ounts for local distribution (COPS, 2003). These repo rts indic ate that the m ethamphetam ine retail m arket is different from other drug markets in m any areas and reflects in large pa rt what has been term ed a \"cottage ind ustry\" model of drug distribution (Eck and Gersh, 2000). In contrast to larger or m ore organized networks, cottage industry drug distribution is characterized by a large number of s mall groups, weak or little organizati onal structure and fluid group m embership. In contrast to a more organized m arket, the cottage industr y drug m arket does not use sophisticated technology or transportation rout es, and handles relatively sm all amount of the drug at a time. This appears to b e the m ethamphetam ine model in rural areas and in areas where it is in its early stages of developm ent. However, areas where m etham phetam ine has gained and m aintained a large consum er audience do, in fact, show signs of more organized group involvem ent. Mexican drug trafficking organizations have made significant inroads into manufacture a nd distribution, particularly in W estern and Midwestern cities where previous ly sm all lab oratory op erators dominated production (ONDCP, 2003). San Diego, Phoenix and Salt L ake City have reported increases in out of area m etham pheta mine product on the m arket for the last few years. Salt Lake City narcotics officers estim ated in 2003 that half of the supply was produced by local groups and about 40% by ille gal aliens. Law enforcement sources in Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 42 several sites with established m eth markets repo rt the sam e shift from a local dom inance of the m arket to gradual inroads of distributors and m anufacturers from outside of the area (COPS, 2003). Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 43 Chapter 3: Treatment for Methamphetamine Abuse Although amphetam ines and m ethamphetam ine abuse has been present in the culture in som e form for ove r 60 years, concern for how to trea t abusers has rem ained a consistent issue for treatm ent providers. Data from TEDS on adm issions to treatm ent in the U.S. have shown a gradual increase in the proportion of adm issions for m ethamphetam ine abuse from one percen t in 1 992 to over 7 percen t a decade la ter, over 125,00 0 adm issions. Data from the 2004 NSDUH indicate that the percentage of over 600,000 meth users who have used the drug in the last m onth, the proportion that m eet the criteria for clinical dependence more than doubled from 2002 (28%) to 2004 ( 59%) (SAMHSA, OAS, 9/16/05). Prior to the rise of cocaine use in the 1970s and 80s, the m ajority of treatm ent approaches focused on problem s associated with alcohol, op iates and sedative abuse. The epidemic of first cocaine powder and then crack focused wider attention on a different population of patients, stimulant abusers. Methamphetam ine abuse in the 1990s brought new challenges to treatm ent service delivery, now dealing with a longer acting s timulant that produced even more protracted physiological and psychological problem s. In addition, m ethamphetamine use becam e trem endously popular in rural ar eas, where treatm ent program s were not traditionally located. 3.1 What Are the Effects of M ethamphetamine? Metham phetam ine and amphetam ine are powerful central nervous system stim ulants that can be consum ed through a variety of routes, each with a different lag tim e to effect dependent on different rates of absorption. The slowest ra te of absorption is wh en the drug is taken orally (in pill form or as t ea), producing effects (more m uted th an with m ore direct ingestion methods) within 20-30 m inutes; it can also be inge sted intranasally (snorted), where it is absorbed by mucosa, taking effect in 3-5 m inutes . The two most rapid absorption routes are injection or inhalation (smoking), where eff ects are felt within 7-15 seconds. Users who inhale m etham pheta mine as sm oke or vapors experience a euphoric ru sh, m uch like that found in crack sm oking, though with m eth the hi gh is sustained m uch longer (NIDA, 2002; Goode, 1999; Brecher, 1972). The imm ediate m ethamphetam ine rush is followed by an extended high that can last 4 to 24 hours. During this period the user is overly stimulated, shows rapid flights of ideas and speech, is highly assertive or confident, but may also display suspicious or paranoid behaviors. The \"high\" declin es as tim e progresses and is followed by \"crashing,\" a period marked by fatigue, hunger, thirst, cravings a nd som e mental confusion. W ithout taking another dose, the user m ay show continued lack of energy, anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure), depression, anxiety, and insom nia (Avis, 1990; U.S. HHS; CSAT, 1999; NIDA, 2002). These unpleasant feelings encourage taki ng repeated doses over extended periods of time. Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 44 Novice users could ingest an 1/8 gram of m ethamphetam ine to produce the effects described above. A regular user would inge st more m ethamphetam ine (\u00bc gr am units) to gain the effect and, on a \"run\" or in a binge of use covering da ys, take m ultiple gram s. The duration of its effect is due to its long half- life. It takes 12 hours for half of ingested m etham pheta mine to be cleared or m etabolized in the system (NIDA, 2002) com pared to the half life of ingested cocaine which is approxim ately one hour. 3.1.1 What is the effect of methamphetamine on the brain? Metham phetam ine is a stim ulant that rapidly cr osses the blood brain ba rrier, ca rried in to nerve term inals by transp orter m olecules. Once in the nerv e term inals, m ethamphetam ine prom otes the of neurotransmitters like dopam ine, norepinephrine and serotonin. Dopa mine rewards and pleasure sy stem; epinephrine con trols thing s such as appetite, m ood and fight/flight responses; a nd serotonin controls sleep and appetite. Normally th ese substances are recycled or reabso rbed (reuptake) into the nerve term inal to be used again when stim ulated. Reuptake occurs when transporters m ove \"used\" or released dopam ine, for exam ple, back into the nerve cell that produces it, ending the pleasure signal. However, norm al reupta ke is inh ibited by m ethamphetam ine, and a neur otransm itter like dopam ine stays in th e synapse longer, failing to shut off the euphoric effect (Avis, 19 90; Volkow, 2001). Sim ilarly, m ethamphetam ine in creases the release of norepinephrine and inhibits its reuptake, causing extended anxiet y, sleeplessness and parano ia. The process is repeated with serotonin, which is thought to contribute to m etham pheta mine user aggressiveness, m ood c hanges and som etimes psychotic symptom s (NIDA, 2002; Cohen et al., 2003). Each of thes e effects is ex aggerated both with higher doses and from extended use of methamphetamine. In som e cases, the effect is what the use r is se eking (exhilara tion, energy), while in others it is an undesirable by-product of the drug (paran oia, confusion). It is the action of the drug on thes e critical neural pathways that is the basis for m any of the serious adverse effects asso ciated with its u se. Immed iate Adverse Effects Like m any other s timulants, m ethamphetam ine effects m ultiple system s of the body. The body responds to m ethamphetam ine as if it were preparing itself in a \"fight or flight\" emergency situation. Heart rate elevates, metabolism increases, blood vessels constrict, pupils dilate, and body tem perature rises. In a norm al response to em ergencies, these effects are short lived, and the body returns to norm al when the crisis passes. W ith methamphetamine use, the effect is sustained for hours, placing an extended burden on the nervous, circulatory, renal, and re spiratory system s. Acute physic al problem s that com e from this long period of being \"hyper alert\" include hypertherm ia, pa lpitations, chills, hyper m otor activity, kidney failure, m ental confusion, tr emors, and dizziness (U.S. HHS; CSAT, W ise Kiyatkin, Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 45 The toxic ef fects of even single m etham phetam ine adm inistration prim arily affect the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system . For exam ple, em ergency room s report cases of chest pain, tachycardia, arrhythm ia, ar terial aneurysm , and hypertension from the increased, sustained stimulation of that system from even a single adm inistration. Overdose or extr eme intoxica tion has also be en associa ted with m ultiple organ f ailure, hea rt attack, stroke and clinical signs of heatstroke (Lan et al., 1998). DAWN reported alm ost 39,000 drug abuse re lated em ergency room visits in 2002 (USDHHS, SAMHSA, DAWN, 200 4) involving am pheta mine or m ethamphetam ine\u2014a 54% increase over levels reported in the m id-1990s. While m etham pheta mine ranks fourth overall in rates of ER visits in the population (7/100,000 population) be hind cocaine, m arijuana and heroin, it is a category of drugs that is concentrated in som e areas and expanding into others. Areas like San Diego and Seattle have experien ced over 70% increases in the ra tes of meth ED m entions in the population since 1995. Othe r areas like Phoenix or San Francisco have remained consistently high since 1995, repor ting rates as high as 80-90 /100,000 populations (U.S. DHHS, DAWN, 2004). Long-term Effects Metham phetam ine, particularly when used chro nically, causes long-term changes in the brain that produce dam aged mem ory, m ood change s and im paired motor coordination, even months after the user has stopped (V olkow et al., 2001). Data from both hum an and anim al studies show that long-term use produces sign ificantly reduced densit y of critical dop amine transporter molecules. The longer and m ore severe the use, the grea ter the loss of dopam ine transpo rter density and th e more severe the r esulting psychiatric sym ptoms (Sekine et al., 2001). A study of over 1,000 m ethamphetam ine users in treatm ent found high levels of psychiatric problem s, such as depression, a nxiety, suicide, and violent or assaultive behaviors. Residual psychiat ric symptom s include prolonged inability to experience pleasure, anxiety and psychotic episodes (Zweben et al., 2004; Cohen et al., 2003). Residual symptoms are also found to be easily trigge red or m ade wors e by new use or even by external psychological stressors (Angrist 1994 ; Rawson, 2004). In a study using PET scans with m eth users and controls, investigator s found three m ajor ar eas of brain function differences am ong metham pheta mine users co mpared to non-users\u2014loss of dopa mine transporters, whole brain inflamm ation, and loss of motor and cognitive ability (Volkow et al., 2001; N ordahl, Salo, and Leam an, 2003). Effects to the cardiac system of users are also reported in the lite rature (Wijetunga, Seto, Lindsay and Schatz, 2003). In a case control study of users, 64% of m eth users showed norm al heart function compared to 88% of age- matched controls. In addition, 28% of m eth users showed severe cardiac dysfunction com pared to 7% of age m atched controls. Pre-natal metham phetamine has also been asso ciated w ith low gestation al weight in hum ans and changes in gene expression and neural de velopment in m ice (Sm ith et al., 2003). Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 46 While use itself produces m edical and psychi atric problem s, methamphetamine production can have adverse physical eff ects on those involved. Ma nufacture of m etham pheta mine involves a num ber of toxic chem icals which, when inhaled, produce serious injury to lung tissue. Manufacture often uses anhydrous amm onia, a key ingred ient in soil fertilize r that can be explosive under som e circumstances. Ca ustics used in production also include acids and alkali, which cause chem ical burns when in contac t with skin a nd pulm onary burns when inhaled. Basic chem icals found in meth labs include solvents (acetone, freon, m ethanol, toluene), caustics (anhydrous amm onia, hydrochlor ic acid, etals and salts (iodine, red phosphorus). The solvent toluen e, for exam ple, can cause ventricular arrhythm ia, and its aspiration can produce renal toxicity. In addition, explosions or fires involving m any of the chem icals used lead to burning of skin, eyes and nasal passages (Dhaliwal and Sood, 2003). 3.1.2 Child Endangerment Child endangerm ent is a critical issue in de aling with m ethamphetam ine use and production. Accidental poisoning of children exposed to metham pheta mine production has been reported in num erous areas (Kolecki, 1998) and is of increasing concern to local public safety responders in rural areas where staff tr aining m ay be lim ited (Weisheit, 2004). Data from the Office of National Drug Control Policy repor t that ch ildren are pr esent at of phetamine related inciden ts (lab seizures, acciden ts) in the United States. Of the over 14,000 incidents in 2003, alm ost 1,300 involved children being exposed to toxic chem icals and over 700 resulted in the re moval of the child to protective custody (http:/www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov). Raiding a meth lab involves a number of law enforcem ent and other p ublic s afety official s (fire services, HAZMA T teams). Too often, however, the responding team finds it is in need of child welfare specialists, social services and trained m edical staff to te st children on the site for e xposure. In 2003, ONDCP a nd the Departm ent of Justice's Offi ce of Community Oriented Polic ing Services began developing Drug Endangered Children initiatives to assist st ates with the coordination of their efforts on behalf of children. As a consequence, a num ber of states have introduced guidelines for address ing the presen ce of children a s well as c reated add itional pena lties for child endangerm ent for the manufacturer who exposes children to the dr ug or its precursors 3.2 Treating Methamphetamine Abuse Many treatm ent specialists have pointed to th e unique challenges associated with treating methamphetamine users (Rawson, Anglin and Ling, 2002, CSAT, 1999). Stim ulant users in general and m ethamphetamine users in partic ular have unusually hi gh rates of relapse, experience extended periods of depression a nd may experience continued episodes of confusion and paranoia, even after a long peri od of abstinence. The protracted craving, mental confusion, depression and even psychotic episodes m ake the m etham pheta mine patient m ore difficult than m any other drug treat ment patients, and one whom providers are in the early stages of learning to m anage e ffectively. As CSAT's Treatm ent Improvem ent Protocol Stim Users states, Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 47 \"Som e of the m ost frightening research findings about MA (m ethamphetamine) suggest that its prolonged use not only m odifies behaviors, but literally changes the brain in fundam ental and long- lasting ways. Anim al studies have shown that chronic use of MA can significantly reduce brain dopa mine levels for up to 6 m onths after last use, with less significant reductions persisting up to 4 years.... The adverse effects produced by MA are often long last ing, and there is som e speculation that some types of da mage m ay be perm anent. Finally, these impairm ents in brain functioning m ay underlie the cognitive and emotional deficits seen in m any MA users. Understanding the chronic effects of MA use is es sential for treatm ent providers who serve this popul ation.\" (CSAT, 1999: 21) Initial approaches for stimulant abuse were developed in response to the rise of cocaine in the 1980s. The earliest stimulant tr eatment m odel was the 28-day i npatient Minnesota model, a long-standing approach based on alcohol abuse treatm ent. A nu mber of program s using this approach sprang up and, by the late 1980s, this model was the m ost commonly used treatm ent for stim ulant abuse (CSAT, 1999). Many of the studies of effectiv eness of various approaches w ith stim ulant abuse com e from this e with coc aine trea e in coc aine outcom e studies share so me common features : individua lized assessm ent and tre atment planning; use of learning or cognitive-based approaches; en gagem ent of patient social networks in the process; a nd skills training and incentives or vouchers for com pliance (CSAT, 1999). Standard approaches like rela pse prevention (Marlatt and Gorden, 1985) also showed effi cacy with s timulant abus e patients, particularly in increasing treatm ent retention (Carroll et al., 1994). Voucher program s (progr ams in which the patient earns vouchers that can be exchanged for money or items continge nt on participation and/ or com pliance) have also shown prom ise with stim ulant abusers. In three randomized clinical trials in the 1990s with cocaine users, researchers found that co mmunity reinforcem ent com bined with vouchers or incentives m odels retained clients longer in treatm ent and produced longer periods of abstinence than standard counsel ing care. The gains were also sustained longer (6, 9 and 12 months after treatm ent entry) than found with standard couns eling (Higgins et al., 1995; 1997). Case m anagem ent approaches have also been ap plied to stim ulant abu se treatm ent. Hall and colleagues (2002) evaluated the Iow a Case Ma nagem ent Project, a program designed to add case m anagem ent services to interventions provided by a standard treatm ent program . Results of a controlled evalua tion of the technique with m etham pheta mine users indicate improve ment in two areas: em ployme nt and in depressive symptom s. The Matr ix Model is an approach developed specifically for s timulant users. Developed in the m id to late 1980s, the m odel combines m any of the traditional treatm ent elem ents from the past in an outpatient en: relaps e prevention, fam ily therapy, 12-step programm ing, contingency contracting and incentives. The original m odel involved a 24-week intensive Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 48 treatm ent period, but m ore recent adaptations ar e of shorter duration (R awson et al., 1996). Data from the Metham phetam ine Treatm ent Pr oject, a CSAT funded m ulti-site outpatient treatm ent study of the Matrix m odel, offers ad ditional sup port. The o bjectives of a series of studies in th e MTP were to com pare the Matr ix Model with trea tment as usual (s tandard care) in a large random ized trial in eight sites. Findings indicate that m eth users who were assigned to the Matrix Model programming partic ipated in treatm ent more actively, s tayed longer and rem ained m ore consistently drug free while in treatm ent. However, com parisons at six m onths post treatment found that all st udy participants im proved with no significantly significan t increas e attributable to th e Matr ix Model programm ing pos t release (Rawson et al., 2004). 3.3 Pharmacotherapies Metham phetam ine abuse provides one of the cleare st models for viewing addiction as a brain disease. Dam age inflicted on neural system s of meth abusers appears m ore extensive, longer lasting and more difficult to reverse than for other drugs of abuse with effects of m emory impairment, mood disorder and m otor skills defi cits lasting as long as 5-10 m onths after gaining abstinence (Volkow et al., 2001). Research findings point to changes in blood flow in the brains of users that m ay indicate ce ll dam age beyond repair (Swan, 2003). These and other findings into the action and resultant damage to the brain caused by stim ulants, particularly m ethamphetamine, prompted a sear ch for pharmacological interventions not only to help m eth users to stop using, but also to reverse dam age caused by chronic use (E rnst et al., 2000). Developing pharm acotherapies for the treatm ent of stim ulant abuse face m any of the sam e challenges faced in dev eloping m edication s for the treatm ent of cocaine; m any candidate medications have been investigated. Because stimulants effect m ultiple neurotransm itter system s, any m edication developed either to block the effects of the m eth or cocaine (antagonists or vaccines) or to replace the effects of the drugs (agonists) m ust interfere with the action of a num ber of system s (Grabowsk i et al., 2004). In the late 1990s NIDA estab lished the Metham phetam ine Clinica l Tria l operation to test a num ber of medications and protoco l in m ultiple sites f or their poten tial in treatment metham phetam ine abuse. These trials often couple m edications with standard ized cognitive behavi oral therapy in double blind placeb o designs. S ome of the approaches that have been tried includ e the use of antidepressants including desipram ine (L ima et al., 2002), bupropion, and im ipramine (Galloway and Newm an, 1996), though there has b een little evidence of their effectiveness with either cocaine or amphetam ines. Ga lloway and colleagues (1994), however, found in a random assignm ent study of i mipram ine suppor t for m ethamphetam ine users that patients on higher doses of the m edication did stay in treatm ent longer than those on lower doses. Fluoxetine and am lodipine have also been test ed in random ized cont rol trials but with disappointing results (Grabowski et al., 2004). Vi gabatrin was also recently tried in a non- random , nine-week study with stim ulant users and showed initial pr omise in reducing use (Barclay, 2004). Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 49 Poor results with these d rugs has encouraged a further look at the use of replacem ent or agonist therapies in the treatm ent of am pheta mine/m ethamphetam ine abuse, m uch like the approach used with m ethadone in the treatm ent of opioid abuse. As with m ethadone, the approach relies in part on a harm reduction model, in that it re places the illicit drug, methamphetamine, with a legal, controlled dose of a sim ilar or replacem ent drug, provided, however, in a therapeutic setting where s upportive services can be supplied. The replacem ent of, for example, dextroam pheta mine for m ethamphetam ine would ideally reduce problem s related to crim e, injection practi ces fam ily and econom ic issues nd health problem s related to escalating ill egal use. Grabo wski and coll eagues (2003) have reviewed the available and som ewhat lim ited research on using replacem ent (agonist) therapies in the treatm ent of m ethamphetamine or a mphetam ine abuse. These studies are often sm all and involve self selected sam ples and self report of behavior change. However, m any indicate that using oral dextroamphetam ine to stabi lize illicit am phetam ine users' dependency can provide som e reduction in the use of other drug s, injection behavior and c riminal activ ity. Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 50 Chapter 4: Summary and Lessons Learned Synthesiz ed at the turn o f the last cen tury a nd wid ely used leg ally un til as recen tly as 3 0 years ago, amphetam ine/methamphetamines have an interesting history. First heralded as wonder drugs for increasing energy and alertne ss, the drugs w ere touted as a powerful therapeutic tool in com bating a variety of m edical conditions. In the 1950s, the drugs were vigorously m arketed for a range of ailm ents like narcolepsy, weight pharm aceutical produ ction of tab lets went fro m 3.5 billion in the late 1950s to 10 bill ion by 1970 (Grinspoon a nd Hedblom , 1975). Metham available in inj ectable for m; in 1962, over 500,000 am poules of methamphetamine were prescribed, contributing to a growing problem of intravenous abuse (Brecher, 1972). Restrictions on the chem icals used to produce am phetam ine/m ethamphetamine and elimination of the ready prescription supply in the 1970s coincided with the ultim ate decline in use of these drugs, a d eclin e that continue d throughout that decade and (in m ost areas of the country) into the next. W hile illicit m anufacture developed in response to restrictions, the availability of high purity m etham phetam ine declined dram atically, as pharm aceutical supplies of precursor substances fell drastically. Locations that had b een focal points for its use saw it virtually disappear. For exam ple, Ph iladelphia, a hotbed of m ethampheta mine use in the late 1960s and early 1970s (Jenkins, 1992), saw m ethamphetam ine use plumm et. By 2003, less than 1% of arrestees in the ADAM Phi ladelphia site tested positive for m eth. While low levels of use rem ained in pockets of the country (W iedrich, 1987), the problem took on a distinctly regional nature. Starting in Hawaii and areas of Southern California in the 1980s, m ethamphetam ine reappeared. With production techniques and m ethods of use im ported from the Pacific Rim (Jenkins, 20 04),m ethamphetam ine in sm okable for m (Ice) b ecam e popular in Hawaii. By 1987 and 1988, law enforcem ent seized hundreds of methamphetam ine labs in San Diego, and by 1990 use had appeared in Phoenix, Denver and Portland (Miller, 2004). By the m id 1990s, it was well entrenched in m any areas of th e West and had m oved i nto the Southwest, Texas and som e states west of the Missi ssipp i, often origin ating in rur al areas.6 Adm issions to treatm ent for m eth abuse in Iowa grew from 1% in 1992 to 12% by the end of the decade. The \"tweaker\" of the 199 0s had replaced the \"speed freak\" of the 1960s. At the m illennium , meth use had m oved slowly but steadily into ar eas of the Mid-Atlan tic and Northeast, often confined in its early stages to small subpopulations of users, such as the gay community or club goers (Paul, Stall, and Davies, 1993) or in the club drug scene (Maxwell, 2004). Metham phetam ine is a uniquely dom estic drug, derived from chem ical precursors rather than from plant or agricultural products. It is ea sily made and often c onsum ed by the \"cook\" or amateur chem ist who makes it. Recipes for its m anufacture abound on the Internet and in 6 See \"Th e Case of a Rural To wn\" in th is report, p age 49. Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 51 published m aterial, m aking it an a ccessible p roduct for relatively unskille d chem ists willing to assem ble the equipm ent and chem icals re quired. Consequently, it is a different distribution network than found with other dr ugs like heroin and co caine that require growers, transporters, producers, as well as dist ributors, to get the product to the end user. For m eth, most production steps reside in th e \"cook.\" As many sm all labs produce less than five pounds of product per production cycle, distributi on is likely to be re latively local to the cook. Many law enforcem ent sources intervie wed for this report stated that the m eth produced lo cally was co nsum ed there as well. The distribution m arket does not always remain small and local, however. Highe r-volume distribution and a m ore com plex distribution system s are found in areas where th e drug has been established for several years and there is a larger dem and. In those area s, law enforcem ent reports increasing m arket share captured by larger local m anufactur ers and organized drug trafficking groups. Today, m etham pheta mine is second only to alco hol and m arijuana as the drug used most frequently in many W estern and Midwestern states. Seizures of dangerous laboratory materials have increased dram atically\u2014in som e states, fivefold. In response, m any special task f orces a nd local and Federal initiative s have been developed to target m etham phetamine production and use. Legislation and negotia tion with earlier source areas for precursor substances have also reduced th e availability of the raw m aterials needed to m ake the drug. There are so me indicatio ns of methamphetam ine use stabilizing in areas where it skyrocketed over a decad e ago. Forty percen t of San Di ego arrestees tes ted positiv e for m eth in 1996, thirty-three percent in 1998, and thirty-six percent in 2003. The same appears true in other West Coast ADAM sites. W hile this is prom ising, the m ovement of metham pheta mine into the South an d the Nation 's middle states con tinues. The \"Case of a Rural Town\" exhibit chronicles the appearance and expansion of metham pheta mine use and production in two rural counties in Illinois. While areas differ in how patterns of use appear, this scenario is reminiscent of accounts of methamphetam ine's earlier appearances in other areas (Herz, 2000; Pennell et al., 1999). Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 52 The Case of a Rural Tow n7 The effect m etham pheta mine use has on the m any areas of society it touc hes is highlighted i n a recent ethnographic study of t he movem ent of m ethamphetamine into the drug c ulture of a sm all Midwest ern community, whi ch looked at the impact of methamphetamine use a nd manufact ure in two ad jacent rural Illinois c ounties. T he am ount of m etham phetam ine seized in Illinois rose from 3,433 grams in 1994 t o almost 20,000 grams in 2001; 57% of the 200 1 seizu res cam e from rural cou nties. The fi rst appearance o f methamphetamine cam e in 1998 in the form of a s mall lab se izure in a town of aroun d 25 people. While the \"cook\" i n that case was arrested and inca rcerated, law enfo rcem ent stated that he reported that he had taught \"6 or 7\" other people how to make methamphetamine. T he next year the town seized 7 or 8 new labs. Over the next few years, t he number of arrests for methamphetamine bega n to increase until they have reach ed abou t 40% of the county's 366 annual felon y arrest s.8 Most of th e methamphetamine produced in th e lab s in these two counties is con sumed in the coun ties. Th e \"business\" of meth production is not well organized a nd relies on bartering or pooling resources am ong users worki ng with a cook. In some cases, the cook agrees to t each others how to make the drug in exc hange for a supply of precursors. Local law en forcem ent sources note that typically very few as sets are fo und worth seizin g or attach ing in th ese local lab s as there is little cash exchanged in the distribution pro cess; th e drug is trade d or bartered away. Treat ment for the increasi ng number o f meth use rs has st rained the s ocial service sy stem in these cou nties.

One sheriff noted, \"We are m andated to take care of their m edical p roblems if th ey don't have r esources to do i t. So t hat means t hat 90% o f the time we have t o pay for t heir medical ... t hey (their teeth) are so abscesse d that we ha ve to do two wee ks worth of high-dollar antibiotics to get the poison out of their system before they ca n extract the tooth .... Last year, y ear '03 for me, I ha d $30,000 in my inmate medical budget. I spent over $60,000\" (Weisheit, 2004:12). The e ffect on the counties has bee n devast ating. Like many rural areas, th ere is on ly on e pro fessional fire depa rtment in the two county area. This department coordinates volunteers to take ca re of county need s, an d the hazards from lab fires, exp losions or toxic materials sp illage and dumping present challen ges to both safety and budget. EMT volunteers are faced with calls from users or their fam ilies where t he patient m ay be expe riencing cardiac difficulties, inhalation of toxic chemicals or be in the midst of a psychotic episode and dangerous to others. Even the local wo rkforce is affected by the invasion of methamphetamin e. Plan t managers in terviewed reported that it tak es numerous tries b efore fillin g positions because potential em ployees fail th e dru g test. He estimated that even with the shortag e of labo r in the area, com panies that drug test appl icants screen out the 25-30% of otherwise acceptable candi dates due to m ethamphetam ine use. The problems related to metham phetamine use and production in th ese two co unties h as been repeated in many areas across the country. Places where the market has bee n establis hed for m any years have developed specialized task forces and re sources to deal directly with their growing problem . Place s whe re the problem is newer and resou rces m ay be more limited , like these tw o counties, are i n the initial stag es of co ping. 7 The description of methamphetamines' ef fect on these two counties is taken with perm ission from Dr. Weisheit's detailed paper describing his work (Weisheit, 2004). 8 The am ount of methamphetamine sei zed i n Illinois rose from 3,433 grams in 1994 to almost 20,000 grams in 2001; 57% of the 200 1 seizu res cam e from rural cou nties. Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 53 Some Lessons Learned In 2004 abo ut 12 m illion Am ericans reported ev er having us ed m ethamphetam ine, and 1.4 million repo rt they used it in the pas t month, a f ar lower num ber than those who use marijuana, cocaine o r even som e illicit pres criptio n medicatio ns. W hy, then, are there increasing ly alarm ing reports abou t meth use in new places a s well as fro m areas that continue to be inundated with problem s relate d to its use? Metham phetam ine is a drug somewhat different from others in the drug culture. It has a large dom estic production component; its abuse is particularly resistan t to treatm ent interventions b ecause of th e protracted impact it has on the us er's brain, ev en after abs tinen ce is achieved; it has a rural following of users, areas where treatm ent and law enforcement resou rces are sp read far thinner than in m ajor urban ar eas; and its m anufacture and di stribution network looks quite different in its ear ly stages of infiltration in to an area than in its es tablished phase. All of these elem ents have ch and tre atment appro aches in their efforts to stop or contai n its spread. The lessons l earned for law enforcem ent and treatment from exam ining alm ost twenty years of a gradual but steady move of the drug from the W estern states to other ar eas of the country are useful. First, a ll data point to a critica l need to view at drug problem s as local problem s first. Metham phetam ine use has been rampant in the West and Northwest since the late 1980s and curren tly represents the m ajor dr ug problem in those locales. Th is serious concentration of a problem is m asked by data developed to derive nationa l estimates. W hile nation al estimates are critical to understanding the Nation's proble ms as a whole, they m ask em erging regional problem s that m ay becom e national ones. A ttention to system s and m ethods of data collection th at can p rovide local estim ates are invaluable in this regard. Second, m ethampheta mine production, established in the m ajor cities of the W est, has m oved steadily into the rural areas of the Midwest and South, wher e production can be hidden in more rem ote areas and a m arket of chem ical suppl ies is available. Rura l towns in states like Iowa, Arkansas, Tenness ee, Kentuck y now f ace serious threats from metham phetam ine production and use. W hile only one m ethamphetamine lab was seized in Virginia four years ago, 61 were seized in 2004; in W est Virginia , that num ber went from 3 to 84 over the sam e four years (CESAR Briefing, March 2005). Th e burden to law enforcem ent in the m any small towns police and/or large county sheriff's departm ents is enorm ous; the costs of clean up, enforcem ent , m aintenance of users in county jails\u2014and can overwhelm limited resources. But the face of m ethamphetam ine production an d distributio n is not simply a rural one. In those areas where the drug is established a nd there is a large dem and, m ajor, often foreign m anufacturers enter the m arket, provid ing far larger quantitie s and more efficient networks for distribution. Thus, legal efforts at restricting the importa tion of precursor chem icals and regulating the availability of prescription stim ulants can m ake a difference in the nature of the production and use of m ethamphetamine. Scheduling of amphetam ines and m ethamphetam ine in 1970 to restrict their availability from an a lmost open m arket in the 1950s and 60s coincided with a Abt Associate s Inc. Meth amphetamine Use: L esso ns Learn ed 54 dram atic reduction in the m anufacture of the dr ugs and their use in th e popular culture for over a decade. Restrictions on the im port of other precursors produced an adaptation in the most popular m ethod of m anufacture. The in troduction of substances or additives to precursors to m ake local m anufact ure m ore diffi cult are prom ising. Fourth, the treatm ent of m ethamphetamine abuse has m oved forward with researchers developing prom ising cognitiv e beh aviora l models, potential pharm acotherapies and other interventions to deal with the devastating eff ects of the drug on its chr onic users, but has to continue as a high priority. As UCLA drug researcher Anglin notes, \"This (methamphetamine) takes us beyond the m odel of drug treatm ent to one of brain dam age\" (in Somm erfeld, 2001), em phasizing the critical need for the developm ent of i mmediate, effective m ethods of treatm ent. In summ ary, inexpensive, easily m ade and in dem and, metham pheta mine is used by housewives, students, club-goers, tr uckers and a growing number of others. It is a drug with wide appeal. Som e users are in terested in its ab ility to m ake them more ale rt; others with its appetite suppressant effects; others with its ab ility to lif t dep ression and/o r make them more confident and energized for extended periods of tim e. This is not, however, a benign substance. Metham phetam ine produces serious h ealth risk s to users, in cluding card iac and respiratory problem s and extended or even perhaps perm anent changes to the brain. It is also a drug whose production creates severe biohazar ds to the areas in which production occurs, as toxic m aterials are dumped, creating years of contam inated land and water supply. It is also a drug that appears to m ove easily into new areas not typically associ ated wi th drug trafficking, and takes hold as producers share wi th other users, and users in turn becom e producers and distributors. W ith the potential of easy production and s ubstantial profits in heavy use markets, m etham pheta mine is also a dr ug that has com e to appeal to larger, more coordinated distributors, who have appeared in established m arkets in the West and Southwest. All of these fact ors m ake m etham phetam ine a major ch allen ge for public health and law enforcem ent for the future. In 1999, Pennell and colleagues (Pennell et al., 1999) highlighted the crisis of m ethamphetamine use in five western cities, warning that \"meth matters.\" The problem described in those areas remains, has moved East and, as the report warned alm ost ten years ago, is no longer a regional one.
