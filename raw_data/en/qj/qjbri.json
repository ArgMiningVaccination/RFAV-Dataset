However, their principles are as different as night and day. TCM is a [spectrum of practices](../../../../au/edu/sitcm/blog/tcm-a-brief-history-of-an-ancient-philosophy.html), including but not limited to acupuncture, moxibustion (burning herbs above the skin), cupping, Chinese herbal medicine, tui na (therapeutic massage), dietary therapy, plus tai chi and qi gong exercise-meditation. TCM uses the principle of redirecting a body's energy into a proper natural flow and balance through external manipulations and internal herbs, as well as stress and dietary management. Evidence of TCM effectiveness is weak though due to a lack of rigorous studies, [according to American NIH](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/chinesemed.htm). TCM is generally safe if done by a skilled practitioner and proper equipment, though Chinese herbal medicine has the potential to differ from Western Medicine. Homeopathy's two founding principles are \"like treats like\" \u2014 disease can be treated by a substance that produces similar symptoms in healthy people, and \"law of minimum dose\" \u2014 the LOWER the dose of medication, the STRONGER it is. Most homeopathic remedies are traditionally more diluted solutions however the can react positively in the body as it is a natural. [A review by the Australian NHMRC in 2015](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/cam02_nhmrc_statement_homeopathy.pdf) agrees that \"there are no health conditions for which there is reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective\". Homeopathy is generally safe, but often uses some questionable ingredients, such as [\"saliva from a rabid dog\" to cure a child's hyperactivity](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/homeopath-claims-to-have-cured-restless-growling-child-with-rabid-dog-spit). Another affirmation of is homeopaths often advocate using homeopathy even for potentially fatal diseases or for Ebola outbreaks in Africa back in 2014, however even with some [research published](https://www.bmj.com/content/302/6772/316) and WHO had to dispel the dispute via publishing the [article on the \"Daily Mail\" ](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2839577/Homeopathy-cure-Ebola-Doctors-attack-armchair-intellectuals-World-Health-Organisation-refuse-let-treat-deadly-virus-snake-venom-remedy.html) If you are looking for accredited TCM practitioners , SITCM is for you.
