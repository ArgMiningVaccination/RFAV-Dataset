We provide integral support in processing and integrating each participant's sacred medicine experience. We are committed to creating and providing a sacred space for those in search of healing; a space where one feels safe and at peace. Each retreat is a unique expression of the beauty and wonder that life has to offer with divine guidance and inspiration. The Red Path Spiritual Healing Retreats offers a compassionate and loving venue for a return to wholeness, and it will only offer retreats and ceremonies in a traditional manner, preserving the sacredness of the ancient rituals. The retreats are facilitated by experienced traditional healers who have walked the Red Road for years, and have trained in Nahuatl, Shipibo, Yawanawa, Huni Kuin and other traditions. Depending on the medicine offered at the retreat, participants must follow a dieta and may be required to enter the Temazcal or Sweat Lodge to cleanse and purify. What is the Red Path? The Red Road or Path is the road of the heart. It is the spiritual journey committed to find healing, wholeness and to live a life with true meaning and purpose. This ancient pre-Hispanic tradition is shared from Alaska to the Patagonia and is characterized for its beautiful rituals and sacred ceremonies. It is a lifestyle that requires dedication to the traditional ceremonies of the Sun Dance, the Inipis or Sweatlodges, Temazcals (Mexico), and Vision Quests among other ceremonies. Founder Andrea Lucie, Ph.D. Mind Body Medicine For the past 29 years Andrea has worked for the Department of Defense including the Marine Corps, Marine Special Operations Command, the National Intrepid Center of Excellence, and at the Marcus Institute for Brain Health at the University of Colorado. She grew up in the south of Chile and in the hills of the Andes mountains. From childhood, she learned the value of traditional medicine through observing her grandparents perform traditional healing rituals. Her knowledge is drawn from traditional educational institutions in the US as well as mentors from the Lakota community and Mexican healers. Andrea specializes in the holistic treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury. As an advocate for integrated medicine and a holistic approach to healing, her experiences include trauma sensitive yoga, tai chi, meditation, mind body medicine, shamanic healing, and martial arts. She has been featured in several publications, including the National Journal, U.S. Medicine: The Voice of Federal Medicine, FIGHT magazine, and recently in the New York Times paper for her work on post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury. Offerings Massage Therapy Body work is offered as an integral piece of your retreat program. Our massage therapist is trained in various modalities to facilitate individual preferences. His experience and training include deep tissue, Thai and Swedish massage. Introspective Work Introspective work and healing arts are the profound self-exploration of internal states. Questions of 'who am I' are explored in a compassionate caring setting. Participants are encouraged to explore deep layers of ego-driven identification to discover the true self. Mind Body Techniques The psychophysiological response to chronic stress and trauma is mediated through techniques designed to stimulate a relaxation response and control dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. In group settings, Dr. Lucie will guide groups in body scans, autogenic training, imagery, biofeedback, progressive muscle relaxation, mindfulness practices and other regulatory techniques. Somatic Practices Yoga, Tai Chi, Qigong, Shaking and Dancing. These movement-based techniques are the perfect combination for learning body awareness and connecting mind, body, spirit, via movement and breath. Additionally, these powerful techniques facilitate access to releasing energetic blockages caused by trauma. Breathwork Based on the traditional Eastern methods of breathwork, our experienced facilitators lead the participants into different breathing techniques for relaxation and increased Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Participants can also experience more advanced breathing techniques. Cleansing and Blessing Ceremony Honoring the sacredness of the medicine, a healer will perform a traditional cleansing ceremony to prepare participants for the journey ahead. Cacao Ceremony The Sacred Mayan Cacao Ceremony is a Mesoamerican tradition, and the guardians of this medicine are the Kiche, Yucatec, and Mexica peoples. Under the guidance and teachings of a medicine woman, the cacao is offered with the purpose to connect to self and others to show gratitude, balance of feminine and masculine energies, and to activate the energy of the heart, for a more compassionate and empathetic life. Meals Nourishment is designed with healing in mind. Whole foods, to include fresh local produce (tropical fruits, vegetables) and freshly caught seafood are the base of the menu. Each meal is designed with the cleansing and ceremony process in mind. Temazcal Temazcal, from the Nahuatl word temzcalli meaning \"house of heat\" is a form of a sweat lodge. This dome-like structure was traditionally created in mud brick, adobe, or even volcanic rocks by pre-Hispanic societies in Mesoamerica. The Temazcal symbolizes the womb of Mother Earth where humans can re-enter to purify, cleanse and heal. Hot volcanic rocks are brought into the Temazcal in four different doors. The medicine man or woman pours water and medicine on the rocks (copal, lavender, tobacco, eucalyptus, etc.), and drums and chants for healing. Medical Screenings Each participant is screened by a qualified medical professional to ensure appropriateness for participation. Before and after the ceremonies, a medical doctor or a nurse will perform a medical checkup. Facilitators and therapists are present with the traditional healer. Additionally, before and after each ceremony a facilitator conducts preparation and integration groups in addition to individual sessions as needed. After the retreat, the facilitators will continue guiding participants through their integration process to ensure proper transition, as they reintegrate into their new routines. Traditional Medicines Ayahuasca (Banisteriopis caapi) A traditional medicinal brew from the Amazon (Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela) also known as yage. Also called the grandmother of all plants or the master plant, Ayahuasca is a vine that when combined with the leaves of the Chacruna (Psychotria viridis), a bush also from the Amazon, can create a powerful psychotropic brew. Chacruna contains a monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), a strong mood regulator. When this brew combines both ingredients, the MOAIs prevent DMT from being broken down in the gut and liver. This combination allows DMT to have psychoactive effects when taken orally and prolongs the intense psychedelic experience ( [drug science.org.uk](http://science.org.uk/)) DMT is considered endogenous, a naturally occurring compound in the body. Evidence shows the possible benefits of this medicine with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and addictions. The ceremonies will be offered to the selected participants only after a strict medical screening and signed waiver. These offerings will follow a traditional ceremony setting with a medicine man or woman trained and initiated in the Amazon. 5 MeO DMT(Sapito, Bufo) 5-MeO-DMT is a natural psychedelic drug found in the venom of the Colorado River toad, Bufo Alvarius, also known as the Sonoran Desert toad. Smoking 5-MeO-DMT induces a short but intense psychedelic experience, with hallucinogenic effects that are significantly stronger than those induced by [DMT](https://www.drugscience.org.uk/drug-information/dmt) (the primary psychoactive molecule found in [Ayahuasca](https://www.drugscience.org.uk/drug-information/ayahuasca)). Despite of this, the difference between 5-MeO-DMT and DMT is just a single Methoxy group, and it is structurally similar to other psychedelic drugs such as [psilocybin](https://www.drugscience.org.uk/drug-information/psilocybin/) and [DMT](https://www.drugscience.org.uk/drug-information/dmt/). ( [drugscience.org.uk](http://drugscience.org.uk/)) 5-MeO-DMT is also known as the Molecule of God, because of profound mystical experiences and shifts in consciousness. Some studies have shown that 5 MeO DMT can improve depression, anxiety, and overall life satisfaction. Participants will be screened for contraindications prior to acceptance to attend one of these retreats. Like the other medicines, this one will also be offered in a traditional spiritual ceremonial context by a medicine man or woman. Psilocybin (Honguitos, Ni\u00f1os Santos) Also known as magic mushrooms, they are considered entheogenic plants. Psilocybin is the main substance found in these hallucinogenic mushrooms. The psychoactive compound of these mushrooms has a profound effect on expansion of consciousness and spiritual growth. Several studies have shown positive effects in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and addictions. The main exponent of the ninos santos was Maria Sabina, a Mazatec healer and poet who lived in Oaxaca until 1985. Honoring Maria Sabina's legacy, The Red Path Spiritual Healing Retreats offers the mushrooms medicine with reverence, respect and in a traditional context. "}
