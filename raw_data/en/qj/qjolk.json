Yet far too many children,especially those from poor and minority families, are placed at risk by school practices thatare based on a sorting paradigm in which some students receive high-expectations instructionwhile the rest are relegated to lower quality education and lower quality futures. The sortingperspective must be replaced by a \"talent development\" model that asserts that all childrenare capable of succeeding in a rich and demanding curriculum with appropriate assistanceand support.The mission of the Center for Research on the Education of Students Placed At Risk(CRESPAR) is to conduct the research, development, evaluation, and dissemination neededto transform schooling for students placed at risk. The work of the Center is guided by threecentral themesensuring the success of all students at key development points, building onstudents' personal and cultural assets, and scaling up effective programsand conductedthrough research and development programs in the areas of early and elementary studies;middle and high school studies; school, family, and community partnerships; and systemicsupports for school reform, as well as a program of institutional activities.CRESPAR is organized as a partnership of Johns Hopkins University and HowardUniversity, and supported by the National Institute on the Education of At-Risk Students (At-Risk Institute), one of five institutes created by the Educational Research, Development,Dissemination and Improvement Act of 1994 and located within the Office of EducationalResearch and Improvement (OERI) at the U.S. Department of Education. The At-RiskInstitute supports a range of research and development activities designed to improve theeducation of students at risk of educational failure because of limited English proficiency,poverty, race, geographic location, or economic disadvantage. ABSTRACTA few renowned early interventions have compelling evidence of enduring achievementeffects for at-risk childrenPerry Preschool, the Abecedarian Project, and the Tennesseeclass-size experiment. The costs and potential for national dissemination of such modelprograms, though, represent key practical concerns. This study examines the long-termoutcomes and costs of another popular early interventionSuccess for All. Relative tocontrols, Success for All students complete eighth grade at a younger age, with betterachievement outcomes, fewer special education placements, less frequent retentions, and atthe same educational expense. Further comparisons to the three prominent interventionssuggest that Success for All provides the strongest educational benefits for the dollar.However, no single program may be relied on as the \"great equalizer.\" 6 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Tl-ie authors thank Spyros Konstantopoulos, Hank Levin, Nancy Madden, Stephen Meyer,Allan Odden, and Bob Slavin for their helpful feedback on previous drafts of this report. vii7 INTRODUCTION Few American policies for improving educational equality and productivity have convincingevidence of long-lasting benefits to students and society. Although a number of earlyinterventions show moderate to strong immediate impacts, these effects generally fade awayafter several years, thus leaving program participants with academic outcomes no differentthan those of nonparticipants. This has been a common criticism of compensatory educationinitiatives, such as Head Start (Lee, (Borman & D'Agostino, 2001;Carter, 1984), and many other early childhood interventions (White, 1985).Along with the programs themselves, the supporting research literature also has beencriticized. Barnett (1995) concluded that studies of only two such programs providedcompelling data showing long-term positive effects on outcomes, such as achievement, graderetentions, special education placements, high school graduation, and socialization: theAbecedarian Project and Perry Preschool studies. More recently, a longitudinal followup toanother well-designed study, the Tennessee Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR)experiment, provided strong support for the long-term efficacy of class-size reductions in theearly elementary school years (Finn, Gerber, Achilles, & Boyd-Zaharias, 2001; Nye, Hedges,& Konstantopolous, 2000). These three studies provide important evidence of the sustainedeffects of early educational policies and programs on students' academic outcomes throughmiddle school and, in some cases, into adulthood. Moreover, they inspire strong hope for theAmerican ideal for education, as expressed by Horace Mann, to be the \"great equalizer,\" or\"balance wheel of the social machinery.\"From a more mundane perspective, policymakers and practitioners also are interestedin the feasibility and costs associated with replication of these model programs and theiroutcomes. A frequently voiced concern about Head Start and other state-funded programsthat have been inspired by the Perry Preschool and Abecedarian efforts is whether they havecaptured the seemingly magical essence of the earlier demonstration projects (Gomby,Lanier, Stevenson, Lewit, & Behrman, 1995). Similarly, the implementations and outcomesof class-size reduction initiatives that have emerged in response to the STAR findings,including the prominent $1.5 billion per year California effort, have not necessarily matchedthe results of the small and highly controlled Tennessee experiment (Bohrnstedt & Stecher,1999). Despite these apparently sobering outcomes regarding replication, there is evidencesuggesting that the long-term benefits to society of the well-implemented pilot models, mostnotably the Perry Preschool program, considerably outweigh their substantial costs (Barnett,1985; Schweinhart & Weikart, 1986).In this report, we present the results from the first analysis of the long-term benefitsand costs of another important and widely replicated early interventionSuccess for All (SFA). Currently implemented in approximately 2,000 schools serving more than millionchildren throughout the United States, Success for All is a school reform program thatfocuses on promoting early reading success among educationally at-risk students. Theprogram was developed by Robert Slavin, Nancy Madden, and colleagues at the request ofthe Baltimore City Public School System, and was piloted in one Baltimore elementaryschool during the 1987-88school year. Four additional Baltimore schools implementedSuccess for All during the subsequent year, 1988-89.Our analyses track the educationaloutcomes through the eighth grade for the original Success for All students and for a quasi-experimental untreated control group composed of students from matched comparisonschools. In addition, we examine the differential costs associated with Success for All andcontrol students' schooling through eighth grade. We conclude by comparing the relativecost-effectiveness of Success for All, Perry Preschool, the Abecedarian Project, and theTennessee class-size reduction initiative. A Conceptual Framework for Understanding theEnduring Effects of Early InterventionsWhat features of early interventions are related to long-lasting cognitive benefits and whywould we expect to find enduring effects from them? A review by Ramey and Ramey (1998)of the major findings of rigorous studies provides consistent answers which help explain theenduring effects of the Perry Preschool program, Abecedarian Project, and Tennessee class-size reduction effort. The conceptual framework, biosocial developmental contexualism,derived from this review predicts that fragmented, weak efforts in early intervention are notlikely to succeed, whereas intensive, high-quality ecologically pervasive interventions canand do. This framework highlights six principles: developmental timing; program intensity;direct provision of learning experiences; program breadth and flexibility; individualdifferences in program benefits; and environmental maintenance of development. These sixprinciples, along with select references to how the three model early interventions serve asexemplars of these principles, are discussed below.The work of Bloom (1964),among others, stresses the great malleability of humandevelopment in the early years of life. The principle of developmental timing supports thenotion that interventions which begin earlier are especially advantageous in that they maycapitalize on this malleability and help alter at-risk children's long-range developmentaltrajectories before they have had the chance to diverge substantially from the trajectories ofmore advantaged children. The Abecedarian Project and other early education programsshowing some of the largest effects enrolled children during infancy and continued forseveral years. The Perry Preschool and Tennessee STAR interventions also started early,serving children at the ages of 3 to 4and 5, respectively. Although the optimal timing forearly intervention is open to some debate, the sustained effects on reading achievement 29 through mid-adolescence for the earlier interventions, Abecedarian, g=0.53 (Ramey,Campbell, Burchinal, Skinner, Gardner, & Ramey, 2000) and Perry Preschool, g=0.51(Scheinhart, Barnes, & Weikart, 1993) were larger than the two effect estimates for STAR' sreductions in kindergarten through third grade class sizes, g=0.22 (Finn et al., 2001), andg=0.32 (Nye et al., 2000))Ramey and Ramey (1998) also point out that early interventions that provide highlyintensive services (indexed by variables including the number of hours per day, days perweek, and weeks per year that the intervention is offered) produce greater sustained effectsthan do less intensive programs. Perry Preschool and Abecedarian provided a range ofintensive services for both children and parents. Similarly, those children from the TennesseeSTAR study with more years of exposure to reduced class sizes showed stronger sustainedeffects than students with fewer years in a small class (Finn et al., 2001; Nye et al., 2000).All three interventions also serve as prime examples of Ramey and Ramey's (1998) thirdprinciple, in that they provided direct educational experiences to participating students ratherthan relying exclusively on intermediary routes (e.g., parent training or home visits) tochange children's competencies.The fourth principle suggests that those interventions which offer a comprehensiveapproach, including a strong educational program, social services, family support, andindividualized assistance, tend to produce larger effects than do interventions with a narrowerfocus. The multipronged Perry Preschool and Abecedarian programs, which offered arraysof services to both children and parents, provide strong prototypes of this principle. Althoughno data was collected in Tennessee to document how reduced class sizes affected teachers'interactions with children, there is other evidence suggesting that smaller classes encouragemore individualized attention to students' academic and personal problems (Stasz & Stecher,2000). Furthermore, findings from STAR revealed that children who attended small classesachieved improved social and behavioral outcomes in comparison to their counterparts inregular-sized classes (Finn, Fulton, Zaharias, & Nye, 1989).The benefits accruing to students from these interventions tend to be driven by theprinciple of individual differences in program benefits. Some children show greater benefitsfrom participation than others and these differences appear to be related to aspects ofchildren's initial risk conditions. An important example of this principle comes from theTennessee STAR study, which documented that minority students typically benefitted morefrom reductions in class size than non-minority children (Finn & Achilles, 1999).A final caveat affecting long-term outcomes is suggested by Ramey and Ramey's(1998) sixth principle, which suggests that the initial positive effects of early interventionwill diminish over time to the extent that there are not adequate follow-ups to maintainchildren's social, behavioral, and academic gains. The only intervention that assigned somestudents to receive follow-up services, the Abecedarian Project, showed that children 31 0 receiving a longer duration of services, during both preschool and elementary school,achieved better long-term reading outcomes than students with shorter durations ofparticipation (Campbell & Ramey, 1995). Over time, though, most analyses of these threeprograms showed slighter effects after the interventions had ceased. Success for AllSuccess for All is, arguably, the most widely implemented, widely researched, and widelycritiqued educational program in the United States. Today, schools may purchase theprogram from the not-for-profit Success for All Foundation as a comprehensive package,which includes materials, training, ongoing professional development, and a highly specified\"blueprint\" for implementing and sustaining the model. Schools that elect to adopt Successfor All implement a schoolwide program that organizes resources to attempt to ensure thatevery child will be successful in reading from the beginning of their time in school. Ratherthan special classes, retentions in grade, and other forms of remediation, the programemphasizes prevention and early, intensive intervention designed to detect and resolvereading problems as early as possible, before they become serious.Schools that adopt Success for All implement a series of reading programs, beginningas early as prekindergarten and extending through the later elementary grades. Studentsspend most of their day in traditional, age-grouped classes, but are regrouped across gradesfor reading lessons targeted to specific reading levels. Teachers assess each student's readingperformance at eight-week intervals and make regrouping changes based on the results.Rather than being placed in special classes or retained in grade, students who need additionalhelp receive one-on-one tutoring to get them back on track. A Success for All school alsoestablishes a Family Support Team, serving to increase parents' participation in schoolgenerally and to identify and address particular problems such as irregular attendance, visioncorrection, or problems at home. Finally, each Success for All school designates a full-timeProgram Facilitator who oversees the daily operation of SFA, provides assistance whereneeded, and coordinates the various components of the program. These are the main featuresof Success for All, both as originally conceived and as currently disseminated.'Similar to the Abecedarian Project, Perry Preschool, and Tennessee class-sizereduction initiatives, Success for All is relatively costly. A recent review of 26 school reformmodels identified Success for All as one of the most expensive reforms, with estimates offirst-year personnel, materials, and training costs of between $70,000 and $270,000 for atypical school (Herman, Aladjem, McMahon, Masem, Mulligan, O'Malley, Quinones,Reeve, & Woodruff, 1999). In estimating the costs of implementing three reforms, Successfor All, the Accelerated Schools model, and the School Development Program, King (1994)also concluded that the per-school costs for Success of All, which ranged from $261,060 to$646,500 per year, were the highest. However, the Success for All developers argue that 4ii schools with high enrollments of poor children generally have sufficient supplemental federaland state Title I dollars to implement a credible form of the model, and these resources oftenare further augmented by reallocated funds and personnel from special education,desegregation settlements, and other sources (Slavin, Madden, Dolan, Wasik, Ross, & Smith,1994).Previous studies of the program's outcomes have focused primarily on its immediateachievement effects. The prototypical Success for All evaluation has used a quasi-experimental, untreated control group design employing matched student samples from twosimilar schools. Although there are exceptions (cf Jones, Gottfredson, & Gottfredson, 1997),the clear majority of these studies has documented positive achievement outcomes andreduced retention and special education placement rates for Success for All students (Slavin& Madden, 2001). Previous analyses of the short-term effectiveness of the program in thefive Baltimore elementary schools revealed effect sizes above 0.50 on individuallyadministered reading tests in grades 1 through 3 (Madden, Slavin, Karweit, Dolan, & Wasik,1993). The most educationally at-risk students, who were identified as the lowest-scoring25% on the pretest, showed the strongest effects from the intervention, with effect sizes ator close to 1.00 (Madden et al., 1993). These outcomes from the pilot Success for Allschools, and their successful replication in numerous other schools, are impressive.Nevertheless, the long-term outcomes of the intervention remain untested and the overallcost-effectiveness of the program is open to debate. Hypotheses of the Current StudyWe hypothesized that, similar to the studies ofthe Perry Preschool program, the AbecedarianProject, and the Tennessee class-size reduction effort, we would find sustained effects onimportant academic outcomes for students who had participated in the Success for Allprogram. Further, although Success for All is a somewhat costly intervention, we expectedthat the model's focus on prevention would not be substantially more expensive than thetraditional emphasis on remediation, primarily in the form of retention and special education,to which control students would, most likely, be exposed.Why would we expect Success for All to promote long-term positive effects forstudents? The robust short-term effects for the program present a compelling empirical caseto support this expectation, but the application of Ramey and Ramey's (1998) six-principleframework provides an added theoretical basis. First, Success for All stresses earlyintervention and prevention, with services beginning in prekindergarten or kindergarten.Second, the program stresses intensity, from its daily 90-minute reading periods to its multi-year approach. Third, learning experiences are delivered to students directly, efficiently, andeffectively in regrouped classrooms and in one-on-one tutoring sessions. Fourth, programbreadth and flexibility are exemplified by the range of services offered to parents and to 51 2 students by the Family Support Team, classroom teachers, and tutors. With respect to thefifth principle, individual differences in program benefits, Success for All appears to havethe most pronounced impacts on the students with the greatest academic needs. The currentstudy helps us examine Ramey and Ramey's (1998) sixth principle: environmentalmaintenance of development. That is, after discontinuation of the Success for Allintervention during the later elementary grades, do children maintain their academic gainsthrough middle school into mid-adolescence and, if so, at what cost? METHODDataAll data, from the 1986-87 through 1998-99 school years, were abstracted from computerizedfiles provided by the Baltimore City Public School System (BCPSS). All studentbackground, transcript, and achievement data were collected by the BCPSS as part of itsannual district-wide testing and data collection programs. We utilized two yearly files, thePupil Information File (PIF) which contains basic data such as race/ethnicity, gender, gradelevel, school, and special education participation information, and a data file containingstudent-level standardized test results. We used data from the district-administered CaliforniaAchievement Test (CAT) and Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, Fourth Edition (CTBS/4).The CAT provided the pretest reading data used in our analyses and the CTBS/4 providedour eighth-grade reading and math achievement outcomes. SampleThe sample included students from the original Success for All elementary schools fromBaltimore, MarylandAbbottston, City Springs, Dr. Bernard Harris, Harriet Tubman, andDallas F. Nicholas, Sr.--and their five matched control schools, respectively TenchTilghman, Collington Square, Patapsco, Harlem Park, and Charles Carroll of Carrollton.These schools were matched on the demographic characteristics of their students andreceived similar base levels of funding. Therefore, the only clear difference between theSuccess for All and matched control schools was the added marginal resources associatedwith the Success for All implementation.' Beginning with the baseline year of Success forAll implementation, which was 1987-88 for Abbottston and 1988-89 for the other fourSuccess for All schools, we identified four independent cohorts of first-grade students fromthe 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989-90, and 1990-91 academic years. Combining these four cohortsof students yielded a total sample of 1,388 Success for All and 1,848 control students. 613 These samples were reduced in our analyses due to listwise deletion of cases withmissing data on the background variables and outcomes. For analysis of eighth-grade testscore outcomes, the final analytical sample sizes were 581 and 729 for Success for All andcontrol students, respectively. All other analyses based on transcript data from the PIFincluded 735 Success for All and 995 control students. Listwise deletion of cases withmissing values did not cause differential attrition rates by program condition, leaving 42%of the baseline sample of 1,388 Success for All students and 39% of the 1,848 baselinecontrols for our analyses of eighth-grade test score outcomes x2 (1 ,N=1310)=1.91 and 53%and 54% of the respective baseline Success for All and control samples for our analyses oftranscript outcomes x2 ( 1 ,N=1730)=0.14.4We also identified subsamples of the lowest achieving students for analysis. Wedefined the low-achieving subsamples as those students whose kindergarten pretest scoresfell in the bottom 25% of their school for that year. From the sample of students with validbackground data and eighth-grade test score results, we identified 148 Success for All and184 control low achievers. The final low-achieving subsamples of students with validbackground and eighth-grade test data were 188 and 250 for Success for All and controlstudents, respectively.Baseline data for the analytical samples are displayed in Table 1. Sample sizes,means, and standard deviations are provided for the full sample and low-achieving sampleand for the samples used in the achievement and transcript analyses. The samples werecomprised of students who were overwhelmingly poor, as indicated by free or reduced-pricelunch eligibility, and African American. Students' baseline ages, recorded during Septemberof first grade, were relatively typical, as were the gender splits.We found consistent differences between the Success for All and control groupstudents on only one background characteristic: reading pretest. In all analytical samples, thedifferences favored control students by more than one quarter of one standard deviation.Attempts to match Success for All and control students one-on-one failed, as statisticallysignificant pretest differences remained in the optimally matched samples.' Therefore,attempts to analyze the one-on-one matched samples were not pursued and, instead, allanalyses included the full control and Success for All samples while statistically controllingfor pretest differences. In addition, in the case of one analytical sample, the low-achievingsample used for the PIF transcript analyses, we found one relatively small but statisticallysignificant difference between Success for All and control group students on baseline age.Analyses of the transcript outcomes for low achievers, thus, also included baseline age as acovariate. 1 4 Table 1Baseline Data for Analytical Samples Success for All Control Full AnalysisSDNMSD Lunch 0.940.250.900.30Age 6.26*0.416.350.46 815 MeasuresStudent Outcomes. Success for All is designed specifically to affect three outcomes:achievement, grade-level progression (or retention), and special education placements. Ouranalyses included measures of all three outcomes through mid-adolescence. We used TotalReading and Total Math scale scores from the district-wide administration of the CTBS/4during the fall of eighth grade. Because this is the only time at which all Baltimore Citystudents are tested after elementary school, we took a student's CTBS/4 score from when heor she first started eighth grade, regardless of when or at what age a student reached eighthgrade.Our analyses of special education placements and retentions in grade included fourvariables: the number of years a student was placed in special education during elementaryschool; the number of years a student was placed in special education during middle school;the number of times a student was retained during elementary school; and the number oftimes a student was retained during middle school. Retentions and special educationplacements during elementary school were assumed to be affected directly by Success for Allpolicies, which explicitly aim to limit these outcomes, and indirectly through students'improved academic outcomes and decreased needs for special services. In contrast, middleschool students' retentions and special education placements occur after leaving the Successfor All elementary school program and, thus, are not directly affected by explicit Success forAll policies.Pretest Covariate. The CAT pretest was administered during the spring prior toeach student's cohort year. For the 1988, 1989, and 1990 cohorts, pretest was defined as thestudent's CAT Total Reading score. Because a Total Reading score was not available formost students from the 1991 cohort, we derived a similar score by taking the mean of threeCAT reading subscales, Phonics Analysis, Structural Analysis, and Vocabulary (a=.88).However, this resulted in a mean pretest scale score for the 1991 cohort that wasconsiderably higher than the mean pretest scores for the other three cohorts. Therefore, westandardized the pretest scores within each cohort by converting them to z-scores. It is thez-score of the CAT pretest that is used in all analyses.Cost Estimates. Our second research question concerned the relative costs ofschooling for Success for All and control students. Several cost estimates were required forthis comparison. First, we established the costs of Success for All using the ingredientsmethod (Levin & McEwan, 2001). Summaries of the total and marginal costs derived fromthis analysis are summarized by school and by year in Table 2. Detailed descriptions of theprogram ingredients were provided by Slavin, Madden, Karweit, Dolan, and Wasik (1992).The authors reported the numbers of tutors, whether Program Facilitators were full-time orhalf-time employees, and additional support staff employed at each school. We used these 16 data to determine the number of personnel required for the Success for All program at eachschool.We derived information regarding the current market values for personnel salariesfrom the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics' (1999) 1998 OccupationalEmployment Statistics (OES) national survey. Costs for Success for All tutors wereestimated using the OES reported median annual salary for teachers ($36,110), the costs forthe lead Family Support Team member were based on the OES median salary for counselors($38,650), and costs for additional Family Support Staff were based on the OES mediansalary for teacher aides ($16,280). To express all salaries in current dollar amounts, all ofthese 1998 salaries were then adjusted to constant 2000 dollars using gross domestic productimplicit price deflators. Finally, we calculated the additional costs of fringe benefits as26.35% of instructional staff salary and 27.99% of support staff salary for each of these twocategories of personnel (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1997).In addition to personnel costs, implementation of the Success for All program at theBaltimore sCauals in'. olved expenses for training, materials, and ongoing professionaldevelopment. Current market value estimates of the costs of these goods and services werederived from pricing information available on the Success for All interne site,www.successforall.net: $70,000 to $85,000 for the first year to$30,000 for the second year; and $23,000 to $25,000 for the third and later years. Themidpoint of each of these ranges was used as the estimate for the Baltimore schools.The Success for All programs operating at the five Baltimore schools focused ongrades 1 through 5. Consequently, the school-by-school and year-by-year marginal costslisted in Table 2 were divided by each school's yearly student enrollment in grades 1 through5 to obtain the yearly per-pupil costs of Success for All used in our analysis. We assignedthese school-specific and year-specific per-pupil costs to all students enrolled in grades 1through 5 in a Success for All school. These marginal cost estimates served as the core of thecost analyses of Success for All and also provide valuable information regarding the currentexpenses associated with replicating the Success for All interventions as originallyconfigured in the five Baltimore schools.'Two additional estimates were needed to calculate the cost of each student'seducation. First, as a measure of the overall market value of each child's basic educationprogram, we used the annual average per-pupil expenditure for the United States, which was$5,330 for the 1998-99 school year (Tom Parrish, personal communication, February 15,2001), or $5.423 in constant 2000 dollars. Second, as an estimate of the overall market valueof special education services, we utilized the annual average additional per-pupil expense ofspecial education, which was $6,404 in 1998-99 (Tom Parrish, personal communication,February 15, 2001), or $6,515 after adjusting to 2000 dollars. 1017 Based on yearly data from each grade level, 1 through 8, we estimated the costsassociated with each year of a student's educational program as a combination of threepossible costs: (a) the current base per-pupil expense of $5,423; (b) the additional per-pupilcost of special $6,515 and; (c) the school-specific and year-specific per-pupil costof Success for All. The sum of each student's yearly cost of schooling through the end ofmiddle school, that is, through the successful completion of eighth grade, was the final figurethat we analyzed as an outcome variable. These analyses were restricted to those students forwhom we were able to establish yearly information regarding special education assignments,school assignments, and grade-level progression from grades 1 through 8. Analytical ApproachThe primary inferential method that we used was standard analysis of covariance(ANCOVA), controlling for pretest score. In one case, for our analysis of low-achievingstudents' transcript outcomes, we also controlled for a statistically significant Success forAll-control difference for baseline age. Each adjusted mean difference between Success forAll and control students that we obtained from the ANCOVAs was divided, or standardized,by the pooled posttest standard deviation for the outcome. The resulting standardizeddifferences, or effect sizes, provide summaries of the magnitude of each effect and areinterpretable as the number of standard deviation units separating Success for All studentsfrom control students on the covariate-adjusted outcomes. RESULTSTable 3 displays the results for the analyses of achievement outcomes and transcriptoutcomes for both the total sample and the low-achieving sample. All statistically significantSuccess for All-control differences revealed by the ANCOVAs are indicated in the far-rightcolumn displaying the pretest-adjusted effect size values. After controlling for thekindergarten pretest differences, Success for All students had higher eighth grade CTBS/4reading and math scale scores, than did control students, Fs (1, 1307)=29.84 and 4.40, ps<.001 and .05, respectively. Expressing the pretest-adjusted eighth grade test scores in gradeequivalents, Success for All students held a six-month advantage over control students inreading, 5.7 versus 5.1, and a three-month advantage in math, 6.2 versus 5.9. The magnitudeof the Success for All reading effect size exceeded one quarter of one standard deviation.These results suggest that the achievement effects of the program, especially in its targetsubject area of reading, attained both statistical and practical significance. 1 118 Table 2Program Ingredients and Total and Marginal Costs of Success for All by School and by Year AbbottstonCity SpringsDallas NicholasDr. BernardHarrisHarriet Certified Reading Tutor 9,826.189,826.189,826.189,826.189,826.18Tutors Sub-Total:$282,703.08$424,054.62$94,234.36$168,816.36$168,816.36Family Support Staff FTEs 22.5000Salary per Social Worker $30,940.00$30,940.00Benefits per Social Worker 8,660.118,660.11Salary per Family Support Staff 16,812.0016,812.00Benefits per Family Support Staff 4,705.684,705.68Family Support Materials, Year 1 $77,500.00$77,500.00$77,500.00$77,500.00$77,500.00Training, Implementation, Materials, Year 2 $28,000.00$28,000.00$28,000.00$28,000.00$28,000.00Training, Implementation, Materials, Year 3 $24,000.00$24,000.00$24,000.00$24,000.00$24,000.00Total Cost, Year 1:$468,438.05$620,548.42$195,292.95$269,874.95$269,874.95Marginal Cost, Year 1:$468,438.05$620,548.42$124,617.18$124,617.18$124,617.18Total Cost, Year 2:$418,938.05$571,048.42$145,792.95$220,374.95$220,374.95Marginal Cost, Year 2:$418,938.05$571,048.42$75,117.18$75,117.18$75,117.18Total Cost, Years 3+:$414,938.05$567,048.42$141,792.95$216,374.95$216,374.95Marginal Cost, Years 3+:$414,938.05$567,048.42$71,117.18$71,117.18$71,117.18 Table 3Achievement and Transcript Outcomes through Grade Full SampleAchievement OutcomesSuccess forAll MaControl MaPooled SD CTBS/4 Total 716.97703.7146.420.29***CTBS/4 Total Math scale score 723.29718.0847.130.11*Transcript OutcomesRetained in elementary school 0.090.250.41Retained in middle school 0.130.150.40-0.04Special education in elementary school 0.550.821.48Special education in middle school 0.490.701.16Age 14.2014.330.58Educational expenditures 53506.3654766.4716786.30-0.08 Low-Achieving SampleAchievement OutcomesCTBS/4 Total 696.06679.8744.980.36**CTBS/4 Total Math scale score 703.20694.6944.770.19Transcript OutcomesRetained in elementary school 0.180.490.53Retained in middle school 0.150.210.45-0.15Special education in elementary school 1.241.741.95-0.26*Special education in middle school 1.011.391.42-0.27**Age 14.2914.520.66Educational expenditures 61663.0966246.7121121.65-0.22* Note: * p < .05;** p < .01; *** p < .001.'Success for All and control mean columns display covariate-adjusted means. 1321 The long-term special education outcomes in Table 3 also show statisticallysignificant differences between Success for All students and control students, with Successfor All students spending fewer years than control students enrolled in special educationduring the elementary school grades and middle school grades, Fs (1, 1730)=15.43 and16.59, respectively, ps<.001. After controlling for the pretest, Success for All students, onaverage, spent about half of 1 academic year (0.55) during elementary school in specialeducation, compared to more than three quarters of a year (0.82) for control students. Thisresult is not surprising in that an explicit policy of Success for All is to refrain from specialeducation referrals, except under unusual circumstances. Therefore, the special educationdifferences between Success for All and control students in elementary school may beinterpreted as a result of this policy, the improved academic performance of Success for Allstudents, or, most likely, some combination of both.Special education placements after the elementary grades, in middle school, are notopen to this combination of interpretations. In fact, if it were the case that the Success for Allpolicy of reducing special education referrals were ill-advised, we might expect formerSuccess for All students to have higher rates of special education placement after they leftthe program, on the theory that some of the students that were not referred to specialeducation under Success for All actually were in need ofreferral. On the contrary, we see thatSuccess for All students continued to be less likely than control students to participate inspecial education in the middle school grades. After controlling for the pretest, the averageSuccess for All student spent approximately half of 1 school year (0.49) during middleschool in special education versus more than two thirds of a school year (0.70) for the typicalcontrol student.The findings for retentions in elementary and middle school are consistent with thespecial education findings, and bear the same importance for judging the effectiveness ofSuccess for All. During the elementary grades, the typical Success for All student wasretained close to 0 times (0.09), compared to control students' 0.25 retentions, F (1, 1730)=67.50,p<.001. In middle school, though, Success for All and control students were retainedat a statistically equivalent frequency, 0.13 and 0.15 times, respectively, F (1, 1730)=0.52.Like the outcomes for special education, Success for All students' lower number ofretentions during the elementary school years most likely reflects a combination of both overtSuccess for All policy and improved student outcomes. Regarding the middle schooloutcomes, again, we might expect to see a higher frequency of retentions for Success for Allstudents than for control students if the policy simply served to promote students who shouldhave been retained. Instead, the results in Table 3 show that there is no difference in retentionfrequency for Success for All and control students during the middle school grades.Associated with the less frequent retentions of Success for All students, we also found thatthey successfully completed eighth grade at a younger age than control students, F (1, 1730)=20.94, p<.001. The difference between the pretest-adjusted means indicated that Success 14 for All students, on average, finished eighth grade 1.5 months ahead of their control grouppeers. Low AchieversWe repeated the above analyses on the subsample of initially low-achieving students scoringin the bottom 25% of their respective schools on the pretest. The results are shown at thebottom of Table 3. Consistent with previous analyses of the short-term outcomes for theBaltimore Success for All students (Madden et al., 1993; Slavin, Madden, Karweit,Livermon, & Dolan, 1990), and consistent with Ramey and Ramey's (1998) principle ofindividual differences in program benefits, the effect size magnitudes for all outcomes forthe low-achieving sample exceeded those found for the full sample. Despite the smallersample sizes and corresponding loss of statistical power, six of the eight outcomes achievedconventional levels of statistical significance.For CTBSI4 reading, initially low-achieving Success for All students had a higheradjusted mean scale score than did initially low-achieving control students, F (1, 329)=9.35,p<.01. Expressing the covariate-adjusted outcomes in the grade equivalent metric; Successfor All students were 7 months ahead of controls, with group means of 4.8 and 4.1,respectively. Although the Success for All students' eighth-grade math scores were nearlyone fifth of one standard deviation higher than control students' outcomes, the difference didnot attain statistical significance, F (1, 329)=2.59.After adjusting for the pretest and baseline age for our analyses of the low-achievers'transcript outcomes, we found that the Success for All students spent fewer elementaryschool years than control students in special education and were retained less often, Fs (1,435)=7.43 and 31.31, p5<.01 and .001, respectively. The special education and retentionoutcomes during the middle school years also favored Success for All students. Thedifference for special education placements was statistically significant, F (1, 435)=8.62, p<.01, but the difference for the retention outcome was not, F (1, 435)=1.91. The feweroverall retentions among Success for All students helped contribute to a statisticallysignificant age advantage at the completion of eighth grade, F (1, 435)=19.56, p<.001. Thatis, after adjusting for the pretest, Success for All students completed the eighth grade 2.8months earlier than did control students. These outcomes have all of the same implicationsdiscussed previously for the full sample. The Cost of SFAOur final transcript-based outcome is the estimated per-pupil costs of schooling through theend of middle school, or through the successful completion of eighth grade. The adjusted 1 5 average costs from the ANCOVA for both the total sample and low-achieving sample aredisplayed in Table 37 These estimates include base per-pupil expenditures, special educationcosts, and school- and year-specific Success for All costs for each year of the students'schooling. After adjusting for the pretest, the costs associated with Success for All students'schooling through eighth grade were statistically equivalent to the costs of control students'schooling, F (1, 1730)=2.76. The mean unadjusted cost of Success for All students'schooling was $54,893.59 (SD=16346.70) and the mean unadjusted cost for control studentswas $53,737.55 (SD=17096.58).The costs of schooling for low-achieving students were considerably higher, with anunadjusted mean of $63,580.42 (SD=20886.57) for Success for All students and anunadjusted mean of $64,804.87 (SD=21323.36) for control students. Controlling for thepretest and baseline age for our analyses of the low-achievers, the adjusted cost for Successfor All students was lower than the cost for control students, F (1, 435)=4.69, p<.05. Themagnitude of the difference, which was equivalent to an effect size of -0.22, suggests thatthe preventative approach of Success for All was considerably less costly than the remedialapproach of more frequent special education placements and retentions, which wascharacteristic of the low-achieving control group. DISCUSSION The findings from this study have important implications for educational policy, theory, andpractice. From a policy perspective, our results indicate that a nationally disseminatedelementary school program may deliver enduring educational benefits to the students itserves at no additional cost. Specifically, Success for All students complete eighth grade ata younger age, with better achievement outcomes, fewer special education placements, andless frequent retentions in grade at a cost that is essentially the same as that allocated toeducating their control-group counterparts. The results also provide another clear, supportingexample of the theoretical framework advanced by Ramey and Ramey (1998), who argue thathigh quality, intensive, ecologically pervasive approaches, like the schoolwide Success forAll model, tend to promote meaningful sustained effects on students' academic outcomes.More generally, this study suggests that the replicable educational practices ofprevention andearly intervention, as modeled by Success for All, are more educationally effective, andequally expensive, relative to the traditional remedial educational practices of retention andspecial education.How does the policy option of implementing Success for All compare to the policyoptions presented by the three other model early interventionsthe Perry Preschool Program,Abecedarian Project, and the Tennessee STAR study's class-size reductions to 15 students?We explore this question in Table 4 by comparing the per-pupil costs and reading and math 16 achievement outcomes from the present study to the costs and reading and math outcomesof the three other interventions.' The average annual per-pupil cost for Success for All,across all years and schools, is multiplied by the average years of participation in theprogram, 3.81 years, to arrive at a total per-pupil cost. The sustained reading and math effectsizes are taken directly from our results previously shown in Table 3.The reading and math effect sizes through age 14 of the two-year Perry Preschoolprogram is taken from Schweinhart, Barnes, & Weikart (1993) and the effects through age15 of the 4.5 year Abecedarian Project are from Ramey et al. (2000). The annual per-pupilexpenditures associated with replicating the Abecedarian and Perry Preschool efforts rely onpreviously reported marginal cost estimates provided by the Developmental Center forHandicapped Persons (1987) and Barnett (1992), respectively, and are converted to constant2000 dollars.' For the Tennessee STAR study, we show the independent estimates from Finnet al. (2001) and Nye et al. (1999) of the sustained effects through eighth grade of four yearsof exposure, from kindergarten through third grade, to reduced class sizes.9 The current costof replicating the STAR study's class-size reductions was determined by expressing inconstant 2000 dollars the recent 1998-99 per-pupil estimate of $981 by Brewer, Krop, Gill,& Reichardt (1999):0 The estimate provided by these authors indicates the average coststhroughout the United States of reducing class sizes to15 students, but does not take intoaccount potential costs associated with higher salaries due to greater demand for teachers andadditional expenses for expanding available classroom facilities.\" The tabulated results,-thus, provide direct comparisons of the current marginal per-pupil costs of replicating eachof the four model interventions along with the long-term reading and math achievementoutcomes attained by the participants from the original demonstration projects at a similarpoint during mid-adolescence.Although all but one of the reading and math effect estimates are relatively largerthan the respective long-term Success for All effect sizes, the other interventions are alsomore expensive. When considering the costs and sustained effects together, Success for Allprovides the strongest educational benefits for the dollar for reading. For each $1,000 per-pupil expenditure, Success for All produced an effect size of 0.12, the Tennessee STAR classsize reductions produced effects of 0.06 to 0.08, Perry Preschool yielded an effect of 0.03,and Abecedarian produced an effect size of 0.01. With respect to math achievement, theeffect size reported by Finn et al. (2001) suggests that the Tennessee STAR and Success forAll interventions produced equivalent effects per $1,000 per-pupil expenditure, and theSTAR effect estimate from the Nye et al. (1999) study indicates a stronger cost-effectivenessratio relative to Success for All. These results provide a helpful context for weighing Successfor All against other policy options and other highly regarded educational interventions:2 17 Table 4Per-Pupil Expenditures and Sustained Effects for Four Educational Interventions Annual PPE'Years ofInterventionTotal PPE'SustainedEffect SizeEffect per $10006ReadingMathReadingMathSuccess for All $6123.81$2,331.720.290.110.120.05Class 15Nye et al. $9984.00$3,992.000.320.370.080.09Finn et al. $9984.00$3,992.000.220.210.060.05Perry Preschool $89292.00$17,858.000.510.490.030.03Abecedarian Project Preschool $10,4964.50$47,232.000.530.650.010.01 Note: PPE = per-pupil expenditure.'All expenditure data were converted to constant 2000 dollars using gross domestic product implicit price deflators. 07 Another key policy issue to consider is the large-scale replicability of the programsand their effects. Success for All and Perry Preschool are the two interventions of the fourthat are available as nationally disseminated models. Studies from diverse localities suggestthat the educational effects of the original Success for All pilot programs tend to bereplicated with a good deal of consistency, but that these effects depend on the quality of theimplementation (Slavin & Madden, 2001). The overall quality of implementation, though,clearly is helped by the Success for All Foundation's growing national infrastructure forsupporting schools that adopt the model and by recent federal policy changes, which makemore supplemental resources available for schoolwide programs like Success for All.Similarly, the educational approach used in the Perry Preschool classrooms and homevisits is widely implemented today, primarily through the use of federal Head Start funds,as the High/Scope Curriculum (Epstein, 1993). Unfortunately, though, the significantresources necessary to replicate the Perry Preschool program, as it was originally designedin Ypsilanti, typically have not been a ailable through public programs (Kagan, 1991;Barnett, 1995). Until greater public or private commitment emerges to replicate morefaithfully the intensive and relatively costly Perry Preschool model, the national replicabilityof the pilot program's effects remains somewhat unclear.Widespread efforts to deliver the Abecedarian model of highly intensive health,educational, and social services_to children beginning shortly after birth have not beenattempted. Indeed, it is unlikely that such a program could be successfully delivered to largenumbers of infants and families. These efforts would require considerable monetaryinvestments and capacity-building efforts to establish a viable program delivery network.Once established, the program would, most likely, require considerable outreach to convincehigh-risk families that such invasive and intensive services were in their and their children'sbest interests. Therefore, although the program shows considerable promise, practical issueshave limited its replication.In recent years, the federal government has made available billions of dollars toreduce class sizes in the early grades. State-led efforts, such as California's massiveinitiative, also have begun recently. At least two noteworthy differences, though, set apartthe Tennessee STAR model from these national and state-level initiatives. First, theTennessee STAR class-size reductions occurred in only those schools that had the facilitiesto accommodate the new classrooms needed to reduce class sizes. Second, the experimentoperated in a relatively small number of schools and, therefore, did not create tremendousdemands for new teachers. As suggested by California's recent state-wide initiative, scalingup class-size reductions to larger numbers of schools has resulted in higher than anticipatedcosts, shortages of classroom space and qualified teachers, and smaller than anticipated 19 achievement effects (Bohrnstedt & Stecher, 1999). In addition, rather than improvingequality of opportunity, Bohrnstedt and Stecher report that the California effort hasexacerbated disparities between districts serving many minority and poor students anddistricts serving few minority and poor students.The final point of comparison among these four interventions focuses on the researchdesigns of the supporting studies. Because this study, unlike the other three studies ofAbecedarian, Perry Preschool, and Tennessee STAR, used a quasi-experimental rather thanan experimental design, causal inferences about Success for All are somewhat moretentative. The findings from this quasi-experimental study, though, are unusually robust, inthat the pretest showed a statistically significant difference favoring control students but theposttest showed a statistically significant difference favoring Success for All students. Thisposttest difference in reading achievement was statistically significant in the ANCOVAanalyses and remained statistically significant even when analyzed as a simple, unadjustedmean posttest difference for both the (1968) noted thedesirability of basing causal inferences on interaction patterns like this, which result in aswitching of mean differences. Cook and Campbell (1979) also argued that these results aregenerally more conclusive than any other outcome from a no-treatment control group designbecause of the implausibility of alternative explanations due to scaling differences, \"ceiling\"effects, regression to the mean, or selection-maturation problems. Therefore, the fact that thisstudy used a quasi-experimental design while the others employed true experimental designsmay be of less significance than one might typically expect.It is the unfortunate reality that limited funds force policymakers and practitioners tochoose between educational interventions. It is tempting, therefore, to compare these modelprograms on the basis of their cost-effectiveness, replicability, and general strength of theirsupporting research and draw a summative conclusion regarding the efficacy of one over theothers. However, Ramey and Ramey's (1998) principle of environmental maintenance ofdevelopment suggests that such a choice of one program over another or a reliance on, forinstance, only preschool intervention without elementary school and later school-basedprograms is misguided. Indeed, as Ramey and Ramey point out, no developmental theory isbased on the assumption that positive early learning experiences are alone sufficient toensure that children perform well throughout their lives. Our results and the results from theother model interventions consistently support these ideas.At mid-adolescence, all students who participated in the four model interventionsenjoyed outcomes that were superior to those of controls but, relative to the initial effects ofthe programs, these advantages had tended to wane over time, and the participants had not 202 9 generally attained normative academic outcomes. For instance, for the mid-adolescentachievement outcomes, Campbell and Rarney (1995) reported that Perry Preschool attendeesscored between the 15th and 171h percentiles and control students scored below the 10thpercentile. Abecedarian Project children scored between the 38th and 41' percentiles andcontrols scored between the 28th and 30th percentiles. The Success for All students from ouranalysis had eighth-grade reading and math percentile scores of 20 and 17, respectively, andcontrols scored at the 1 4th and 15th percentiles, respectively.It is not likely that any one of these interventions could serve as the \"great equalizer,\"or as the educational equivalent to the polio vaccine, which provides a child with protectionfor a lifetime all in one early dose. To compensate for poor schools, suboptimal health care,economic hardship, and other contextual conditions known to have adverse effects on at-riskstudents' development, educational interventions must be more akin to flu shots, which areadministered throughout one's life as new risks arise within the environment. Rather thanchoosing one intervention over the others, the best policy may be to expand high-qualitypreschool programs, to continue scaling up elementary-school-based class-size reductioninitiatives and Success for All programs, and to implement additional middle school and highschool interventions to sustain the effects of the earlier programs. 2130 REFERENCESBarnett, W.S.

(1999) both analyzed the followup data to the TennesseeSTAR study and arrived at somewhat different sustained effect estimates for students whowere taught in small classes during all four years of the study. We present the outcomesreported in both studies and suggest that they should be interpreted as an estimated range ofpotential effects.2 Compare, for example, the original Success for All pilot program as described by Slavin,Madden, Karweit, Dolan, & Wasik, (1990) and a more recent description by Slavin andMadden (2001) of the current model that is available.3 The added resources for implementing Success for All came from various sources. Thefunding for the Abbottston Success for All program was provided by Chapter 2 funds, CitySprings paid for its implementation through a grant from a private foundation, and theremaining Success for All schools used funds from a U.S. Department of Education dropoutprevention grant (Slavin, Madden, Karweit, Dolan, & Wasik, 1990).For three schools, Dallas Nicholas, Bernard Harris, and Harriet Tubman, the expensesrelated to tutors were, essentially, \"costless\" relative to the control schools as these schoolsreassigned their Title I reading instructors as Success for All tutors. The control schools alsohad Title I reading teachers, but in the control schools, the Title I instructors continuedteaching traditional reading pullout classes rather than offering tutoring help, as specified bythe Success for All model. The difference between the Success for All costs when oneconsiders this a costless redeployment, as we have, and the Success for All costs when oneconsiders this redeployment as an added cost is expressed by the difference between our costfigures in Table 2 labeled, respectively, marginal costs and total costs.Although the Success for All and control student attrition rates were statistically equivalent,there is a possibility that the Success for All students who dropped out of our analyses weresystematically different from the control students who dropped from our analyses. Suchdifferences could bias our estimates of the program effects and compromise the internalvalidity of the study. In addition, it is possible that those Success for All and control studentswho dropped from our analyses were systematically different from those who remained inthe analytical samples. Differences of this sort could limit to whom we might generalize ourresults and, thus, might compromise the study's external validity.First, we contrasted the background characteristics of those Success for All and controlstudents who dropped out of our analyses. The two groups were statistically equivalent onall background characteristics, with the exception of the statistically significant differenceon the reading pretest score for those who dropped out of the transcript analysis sample,t(868)=-5.97, p<.001 (two-tailed), g=-0.40, and g= -0.38. The magnitudes of these differences, though,were essentially the same as the magnitudes of the pretest differences for the samples thatwe retained for our transcript analyses (g= -0.35) and achievement analyses (g=-0.35).Therefore, these results do not provide evidence of differential attrition. 2635 Second, with respect to the study's external validity, we contrasted the backgroundvariables of Success for All and control students who dropped out of our study to thebackgrounds of Success for All and control students who we were able to retain in ouranalyses. The students retained in our transcript analysis samples and the students whodropped from our transcript analysis were statistically equivalent on all backgroundvariables. However, for the achievement analyses, those who were retained in the analysishad higher pretest scores than those who were not retained for both the Success for Allsample, t(1136)=-4.68, p<.001 (two-tailed), and for the control sample, t(1463)=-3.70, p<.001 (two-tailed). These results suggest that our analyses of the transcript outcomes havegreater external validity than our analyses of the achievement outcomes. However, given theconsistency of the outcomes across the transcript and achievement analyses, it does notappear that this discrepancy had serious consequences for the general direction andmagnitudes of the effect estimates.5 One-on-one computerized matching of Success for All and control students was attemptedusing an algorithm developed by Bergstralh and Kosanke (1995), which is based on theoptimal matching procedures described by Rosenbaum (1989). Statistically significantSuccess for All-control pretest differences remained even after the optimal one-to-oneSuccess for All-control pretest matches were identified by the computerized matchingprocedure.6 Encouragingly, the marginal cost estimates we derived based on the ingredients methodwere somewhat consistent with the original marginal costs estimated by Slavin, Madden,Karweit, Dolan, & Wasik (1992). Slavin et al. reported that the marginal costs, in 1988dollars, of two of the original Success for All implementations, at Abbottston and CitySprings Elementary, were $400,000 and the marginal costs of the remaining three programswere $40,000. The developer indicated that these estimates included all program ingredients,personnel, training, materials, and professional development, at Abbottston and City Springs(Robert Slavin, personal communication, 11/1/00). At the other three schools, though,existing personnel were shifted to fill most of the new positions required by the Success forAll program. Marginal costs at these schools were limited to a half-time program facilitator,training, materials, and professional development.To compare our marginal cost estimates to the original amounts indicated by Slavin etal. (1992) (i.e., $400,000 for Abbottston and City Springs and $40,000 for the remainingthree Success for All schools), consider the school-by-school averages of our Year 1, 2, and3 marginal cost estimates converted to 1988 dollars: Abbottston, $323,144.12; City Springs,$436,373.87; Dallas Nicholas, $71,117.18; Dr. $71,117.18; Harriett Tubman,$71,117.18. For every school but Abbottston, our estimates were higher than the developer'soriginal estimates. This comparison suggests that, if anything, our method tended to providea relatively liberal estimate of the costs of implementing Success for All.Because varying cost assumptions may lead to different results, we conducted furthersensitivity analyses that employed 1987-88 Baltimore City Public School System data on:(a) average per-pupil expenditures; (b) average per-pupil special education expenditures; and(c) personnel salaries and benefits rates (for calculating the personnel costs associated withSuccess for All implementation). Because no historic estimates of the Success for All 273 6 materials, training, and professional development costs were available, we used the same costdata reported on the Success for All internet site. In general, analyses of these data, adjustedto constant 2000 dollars, indicated that the costs of schooling through the successfulcompletion of eighth grade for both control and Success for All students were somewhat lessthan the costs reported in Table 3. Because the Success for All-control differences, though,were essentially the same as those reported in Table 3, we elected to use the reported nationalcost estimates, which provide policymakers and practitioners more pertinent informationregarding the national expenditures associated with Success for All and control students' schooling. The results of the sensitivity analyses are available from the first author onrequest.We have compared the interventions across these two outcomes, reading and mathachievement, for two main reasons. First, from a practical standpoint, these are the primaryoutcomes that are consistently documented across the studies of all four interventions.Second, and more importantly, we consider reading and math achievement outcomes as twokey educational outcomes at eighth grade. We also believe that these outcomes are strongpredictors of other future educational and adult outcomes. Indeed, as Jencks and Phillips(1998) argue, reducing the test score gap is probably both necessary and sufficient forsubstantially reducing inequality in educational attainment and earnings. It is important tonote, though, that these comparisons do not go beyond eighth grade and, therefore, excludesome data, most notably from the Perry Preschool intervention, that show lasting effects intoadulthood on outcomes including social adjustment and economic success (Barnett, 1992;Schweinhart et al., 1993). These long-term benefits to students and society have considerablyoutweighed the substantial costs associated with the original preschool program (Barnett,1985; Schweinhart & Weikart, 1986).All per-pupil costs cited in Table 4 represent a similar estimate of each program's marginalcosts; that is, the amount spent on program students beyond that which was spent on controlstudents. However, some may argue that the elementary school programs, Success for All andTennessee class-size reduction, have a sort of unfair advantage over the preschool programs,in that the control students at the elementary level receive at least a base level of expenditureprovided by the public school system. If we were to assume that such a base existed for thepreschool control students, how would that impact our results? Using as a base the averagefiscal year 2000 per-pupil expense of Head Start, which was reported by the Head Start Bureauas $5.951 (see http://www2. act: dhhs.gov/programs/hsb/about/fact200I. htm), we found that theoverall additional expense of the two years of Perry Preschool would be $5,956 and the addedexpense of the four and a half years of the Abecedarian program would be $20,452.50. Usingthese figures, the effect per $1,000 investment in Perry Preschool is 0.09 and the effect per$1,000 investment in Abecedarian is 0.03. This adjustment, therefore, does not fundamentallyalter our conclusion regarding Success for All's overall cost-effectiveness advantage.9 These effects from the Tennessee STAR study are based on the select subsample ofstudents who experienced small classes during all four years of the study. Our Success forAll effect estimate is based on a more conservative treatment definition, which is akin to an\"intention-to-treat\" definition: that is, we analyzed the effects of initial first-grade enrollmentin a Success for All school regardless of students' participation in later years. Students' yearsof attendance in Success for All schools and small classes, though, were similar.2837 I\u00b0 The estimate of $998, in constant 2000 dollars, by Brewer et al. (1999) is very similar toa basic per-pupil estimate of the costs particular to the Tennessee STAR study. Specifically,Ritter and Boruch (1999) reported that in 1985 the Tennessee legislature appropriated $3million for each year of the 4-year study. Ritter and Boruch stated that the majority of thesefunds were used for hiring the additional teachers and classroom aides required by theproject. Using the $3 million figure and Ritter and Boruch's estimates of 1,900 studentsoriginally assigned to small classes and 2,200 students originally assigned to classrooms withaides, we may establish a yearly per-pupil cost estimate of $609.76 in 1985 dollars, or$886.24 in constant 2000 dollars.\" This represents one of two important issues that may be of considerable consequence inour cost estimate for class-size reductions. In both regards, Levin, Glass, and Meister (1987)provide helpful information. First, the authors indicated that the additional costs of aclassroom, which include the physical space, furnishings, energy needs, insurance, andmaintenance in addition to a teacher, totaled $28,138 in 1980 dollars. Converting this amountto constant 2000 dollars using gross domestic product implicit price deflators, the cost is$54,172. If we assume an average class-size reduction in the Tennessee STAR study of 40%,from 25 to 15 students, we obtain a per-pupil expenditure estimate of $1,444.59 for a smallclass of 15 students (0.40 * $54,172 / 1541,444.59). This estimate, which includes theadditional expenses required for classroom space but does not include potential increases inteacher salaries, is 31% higher than the figure reported by Brewer et al. (1999) that we usedin our cost-effectiveness estimates in Table 4.Potentially impacting the cost estimate associated with class-size reductions in theopposite direction, Levin and his colleagues argued that \"reduction in class size is an overalleducational intervention that should affect all of the educational activities during the schoolday\" (p. 64). As a result, the authors argued that only a portion of the marginal cost of class-size reduction should be viewed as an educational intervention to improve a single subjectarea, such as reading or math. Levin et al. stated that about one third of the school day isdevoted to reading, and the other two thirds is spent on other activities. Accordingly, theydivided the total marginal cost of class-size reduction by three to obtain an estimated cost forreading instruction and for math instruction.Similar to this line of reasoning, and as suggested by our theoretical framework, ourperspective is that reductions in class size, Success for All, the Perry Preschool, and theAbecedarian Project all represent comprehensive educational programs. Accordingly, wehave presented a range of educational outcomes for Success for All and have compared therelative effects of the four programs on the basis of two key educational outcomes: readingand math achievement. This latter adjustment suggested by the work of Levin at al.,therefore, is not applicable to our theoretical and analytical framework, as the sameadjustment could be applied to each of the four interventions we have considered.12 Odden and Archibald (2000) recently provided useful analyses and demonstrations of howschools may implement full-scale Success for All programs without spending any additionalresources. Through resource reallocation, it may make it possible for schools to implementSuccess for All, to achieve similar educational outcomes to those documented here, and topay little to no additional per-pupil expenses. 293 8 CRESPAR Johns Hopkins UniversityCenter for Social Organization of Schools3003 North Charles Street- Suite 200Baltimore MD 21218410-516-8800 / 410-516-8890 fax Howard University2900 Van Ness Street, NWWashington (Required for PRIORITY documents only): FAST TRACK JUSTIFICATION (Check all that apply):Department of Education Document121/0ERIElNCES Congressional Document Executive Office of the President Document Major National Association, Foundation, Non-Profit Institution Document High Media Exposure Document Other Reason (Specify): PRIORITY status (specified by ERIC:fPrOgram.:Office)PROCESSING DATA (Required for PRIORITY Documents only):Date Acquired by FacilityDate Shipped to Clearinghouse:Date Received by ClearinghouSeDate Back. by Accession..#:Date Received Back:.RIE Issue ED # SPECIAL PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS: See over for general FAST TRACK instructionsPLEASE KEEP MOSFORDOCUMEW DUMASPFi0CESSIKa\u00b0 Fast Track Instructions Fast Track documents require expedited processing.
