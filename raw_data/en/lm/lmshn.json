Walter Laing Macdonald Perry was a native of Dundee, educated at Morgan Academy Dundee, Ayr Academy,Dundee High School and St Andrews University (MB ChB, MD and DSc), winning theRutherford Silver Medal for his MD thesis and the Sykes Gold Medal for his DSc thesis. AfterCasualty Officer and House Surgeon posts in 1943-44, he served as a Medical Officer in theColonial Medical Service in Nigeria in 1944-46, then briefly as a Medical Officer in the RAF,1946-47, before embarking on a scientific career on the staff of the Medical Research Councilat the National Institute for Medical Research from 1947 to 1958, serving as Director of theDepartment of Biological Standards from 1952 to 1958. Professionally, he achieved MRCP (Ed)in 1963 and was elected FRCPE in 1967, FRCP in 1978, FRSE in 1960 and FRS in 1985. In 1958 he came to Edinburgh as Professor of Pharmacology, holding the Chair from 1958 to 1968. During this time he also served as Dean of the Faculty of Medicine (1965-67) andVice-Principal of the University (1967-68) before leaving to become the inaugural Vice-Chancellor of the Open University in 1968, a post he held until 1980. During this period at theOpen University he developed a second distinguished career as a university administrator anda promoter and facilitator of open and distance learning, in which fields he later performedextensive work on behalf of the United Nations. A third career, in politics and public life,began with his ennoblement to a life peerage in 1979, taking the title of Walton in the County 203 \u00a9 2004 The Royal Society on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from of Buckinghamshire, the initial base of the Open University. Latterly Walter sat as a Liberal Democrat, having twice been Social Democratic Party deputy leader in the Lords in the 1980s.He took an active role in the Lords' Select Committee on Science and Technology and heldinterests in and spoke on many areas of public policy, including fisheries policy. Recognition of his distinguished careers came with a succession of honours; OBE in 1957, Knight Bachelor in 1974 and Baron in 1979; 10 honorary degrees from UK, North American,Indian and Australian universities and Fellowships of the Open University and UniversityCollege London; the Wellcome Gold Medal in 1993 and Inaugural Royal Medal of the RoyalSociety of Edinburgh in 2000. He was Chairman, President or member of numerous commer-cial, educational, public interest and scientific bodies. Lord Perry's publications included soleor part authorship of approximately 90 books, research papers and abstracts. Shining through Walter Perry's careers are strengths of commitment and sheer hard work, rigorous analysis of scientific, educational and organizational problems, experimentation andpursuit of clear objectives. Against scepticism, elitism and ill-informed criticism he drovethrough the establishment of the Open University. It is today respected internationally, is bysome orders of magnitude our largest university in terms of student enrolment and is a demon-strably successful outcome from an experiment initiated 40 years ago. It represents a fine mon-ument to Walter Perry. THE FORMATIVE YEARS , 1921-47 Early family life and medical school, 1921-44 Walter Perry was born (on 21 June 1921) and raised in Dundee by Fletcher and Flora Perry.Fletcher was Head of Customs and Excise in Scotland; he taught singing in his spare time andsang lead baritone in local opera and oratorio. Flora was medically qualified, as were five of hereight brothers and sisters, Walter and his sister. At the age of 16 years he finished his schoolingand entered St Andrews University to read medicine, graduating in 1943 aged 21 years. At thattime most of the students who enrolled in St Andrews completed their clinical training in DundeeRoyal Infirmary. In Walter's year there were only 35 students and teaching in the clinics was onan almost a one-to-one basis. There were very few specific remedies and epidemics of diphthe-ria and polio were commonplace. After graduation he completed his house jobs in Dundee RoyalInfirmary and then joined the Colonial Medical Service. In 1944, after a three-week crash courseat the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, he was posted to Nigeria. Colonial service in Nigeria, 1944-46 Although Walter writes about his time in Nigeria with some amusement, he was in realitythrown in at the deep end. Within a week of his arrival in Kaduna, 400 miles north of the Nigerdelta, to replace the resident on leave, he operated successfully on the wife of the dispenserfor a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. When the resident returned six months later, Walter wastransferred to Igboni near Lagos, as it turned out to supervise the building and equipping of arehabilitation hospital to provide for members of the Royal West African Frontier Force fight-ing in North Africa. He spent six months in Lagos ordering materials and equipment and com-mitting what appeared to him to be large sums of money but never saw the hospital. His nextposting was to Makurdi, the capital of Benue, 200 miles north of the Niger delta. There he wasthe only doctor in a region of about half a million souls. The hospital beds had 120 beds with204 Biographical Memoirs on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from never fewer than 200 occupants. His day started with an outpatient clinic for about 100 before breakfast. In addition to the hospital, Walter was supposed to supervise the activities of nineoutlying dispensaries. Much of his work consisted of treating parasitic diseases and thesurgical treatment of serious accident victims, yet the central medical stores in Lagos on oneoccasion managed to run out of both Leishmann's stain and scalpel blades. These and otherdeficiencies persuaded Perry that his future lay elsewhere. Royal Air Force, 1946-47 On returning to the UK he was called up to serve briefly in the RAF; after a few weeks he wasposted to the RAF College at Cranwell, the school for cadets who were to make their careerin the service. Again, Walter had amusing tales about dining-in nights and dealing with noth-ing more serious than broken collarbones. Sir Frederick Warner FRS, a friend of Walter's for 56 years, writes of Perry: In 1947 he joined a group which had survived through the war in monthly meetings at The Rising Sun in Tottenham Court Road, continuing what had started at University College London through Sir JackDrummond. It provided a place to talk, among other things, about scientific developments and medicine,including health problems in the continuing war in the East. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FORMEDICAL RESEARCH , 1947-58 Department of Parasitology Before joining the RAF, Perry had briefly returned to Dundee to discuss his future with the Dean of Medicine. The Dean drew his attention to a vacancy in the Department of TropicalMedicine in the Medical Research Council's National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR),to work with Frank Hawking. Unknown to Walter, Hawking had applied for a 'B' release forWalter, which allowed Walter to leave the RAF early to take a specific civilian job, and Walter'scommitment to research was sealed. Together they worked on a Plasmodium species that causes malaria in monkeys in an attempt to find the tissue in which the parasites resided during theincubation period of the disease (1, 2, 5, 9)*. Unfortunately, their work was brought to an endwhen Shortt and Garnham published a short note in Nature showing that the exo-erythrocytic cycle of the parasite takes place in the liver (Shortt & Garnham 1948). Perry, and presumablyHawking before him, working with high-powered microscopes using an oil-immersion lens,had missed the large clumps of parasites in the liver, which could be identified with a hand lens.Although disappointed by this loss of priority, Walter was clearly hooked on research and laterwrote, 'I learned a lot from this early experience and always carried out my researches in thefuture on the basis that I was taking part in the only really organised game for adults' (68). In another series of experiments with Hawking, Perry showed that the addition of paludrine to cultures was ineffective as an inhibitor of the maturation and spread of the parasites to addi-tional cells until it had been exposed to liver extract (3, 4). Later workers at ICI isolated theactive metabolite produced in the liver from the parent compound. Walter, like all the other research workers at NIMR, was also expected to do some work for the Department of Biological Standards (DBS). Although, initially, Walter regarded this asrather a chore it was to herald another career change that saw him become Director of thatWalter Laing Macdonald Perry 205 * Numbers in this form refer to the bibliography at the end of the text. on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from department only a few years later. The DBS was contracted to the Ministry of Health (MOH) to advise on the implementation of the Therapeutic Substances Act, which defined the acceptedtoxicity and potency of batches of drugs that could not be controlled by physico-chemicalmeans and therefore required bioassay. At that time neoarsphenamine was still widely used totreat syphilis, and every batch had to be assayed for toxicity and potency against a standardpreparation of the drug stored in the department. Because the human form of the organismresponsible for syphilis, Treponema pallidum, could not be cultured in the laboratory, the potency was tested on an easily grown trypanosome (6, 7). He submitted the work for an MDin June 1948 (8); it was not only commended but awarded the Rutherford Silver Medal. Although the laboratory work on neoarsphenamine was easy and the protocol controlled almost by statute, the analyses of the results by statistical methods were always, perhaps evento this day, under debate and Perry ,who could not resist an argument, was committed evenmore firmly to a career in research. Under the tutelage of Cliff Emmens, a part-time statisti-cal advisor to the Institute and an author of a book on the subject, Perry began to train for therarest of specialties, statistical methods applied to bioassay. In an appreciation prepared for the Board of the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), Derek Bangham (see Bangham 1999) gives an insider's account ofPerry's contribution to the work of the board. He draws attention to Perry's earliest statisticalwork on bioassay in which he improved the bioassay for insulin on mice, developed by J. H.(later Sir John) Gaddum (FRS 1945) about 40 years earlier. Perry modified Gaddum's method,which was based on the number of animals that survived an injection of insulin (LD 50), to one in which the survival time of each animal was used. This not only reduced the number of ani-mals required for each assay but allowed the results to be analysed by a technique known asa parallel line assay, giving a much more precise estimate of potency (21, 28). Perry, who had never quite hit it off with Hawking, and having published the work on neoarsphenamine in Nature and concluded his MD, was looking for a new interest and even considered going into general practice. By another happy coincidence Emmens accepted achair in Australia and as he was leaving advised the Director of NIMR, Sir Charles HaringtonFRS, that Walter was the only one in the Institute who had shown any interest in statistics. Soa deal was struck: Walter would take over as statistics advisor provided he could transfer outof tropical pharmacology into pharmacology in the Department of Physiology, headed byG. L. (later Sir George) Brown FRS. Thus, in 1948 Perry came to work part-time in physiol-ogy while he was studying statistics two days a week under Sir Bradford Hill FRS at theLondon School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and E. S. Pearson (FRS 1966) at UniversityCollege. Almost immediately he was called on to carry out statistical work for all the staff atNIMR and in particular the DBS under Ashley (later Sir Ashley) Miles (FRS 1961). WithMiles, Walter began to attend meetings of the Expert Committee on Biological Standardisationof the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Geneva, where he learned a lot more about mak-ing and holding the International Standard preparations for hormones, antibiotics, vaccinesand antitoxins (12, 13, 18, 25, 26, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 50, 51, 55-57). As weshall see later, by 1952 Perry's expertise and reputation in this field was such that he wasappointed to be Director of the DBS when Miles left to head the newly formed Lister Institute. Department of Physiology The Physiology Department at NIMR had a worldwide reputation. Sir Henry Dale had retiredjust two years earlier and the department had been the scene of his work with Gaddum,206 Biographical Memoirs on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from W. S. Feldberg, M. L. V ogt and Brown. All were Fellows of The Royal Society. Dale was a Nobel laureate, holder of the Order of Merit and a past President of the Society (1940-45).Perry joined an equally distinguished group of younger men, F. C. MacIntosh (FRS 1954),W. D. M. (later Sir William) Paton (FRS 1956), J. A. B. (later Sir John) Gray (FRS 1972),B. D. Burns (FRS 1968) and J. L. Malcolm under the direction of Brown, who continued Daleand Gaddum's work on synaptic transmission. Much of the work was devoted to proving thattransmission in the peripheral and central system was chemical and that acetylcholine was themajor transmitter. On the basis of his previous experience with Hawking, who had directed his work fairly tightly, Perry was surprised when Brown told him to talk to the members of the laboratory andfind himself a project that interested him. This he found particularly difficult. His clinicalexperience was of little value, as was his training with Hawking. His earlier training in phys-iology and pharmacology in St Andrews in wartime Britain was virtually useless. Indeed, onesuspects that the possibility of chemical transmission occurring outside the slowing of theheart by the vagus nerve was only mentioned in passing, if at all. However, he was luckyenough to start work with MacIntosh, who taught him to perfuse sympathetic ganglia andassay the effluent of potassium released by nerve stimulation, which they published together(10, 11, 13, 24). Not only did Perry's friendship with MacIntosh and the others last a lifetimebut this feature seemed to extend to anyone that had worked with Perry. (In my own experi-ence, I spent three very happy years in MacIntosh's department in McGill. The others, in par-ticular Paton, always greeted me on first name terms and treated me as if I were anequal.\u2014J.S.K.) Over the next two or three years Perry worked on the mechanisms of transmission in auto- matic ganglia (11, 19-21, 32-35, 40-42, 45, 48, 49, 53) and on the actions on transmissionthere and at the neuromuscular junction (15). The work was technically extremely difficult andthe extracellular electrical recording methods were crude and probably already surpassed else-where. Perry must have been an able pupil, and published several papers using both gut bathassays and electrophysiological techniques to show that acetylcholine was also the transmitterat sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia. (As an honours student in Edinburgh I saw himperfuse both these ganglia as class demonstrations. This is no mean feat and compares indifficulty with complex eye surgery. Amazingly the experiment worked in spite of the highconcentrations of nicotine exhaled by the experimenter and inhaled by the animal.\u2014J.S.K.).Thus, Perry working part-time in the department published a comprehensive number of papersin a variety of prestigious journals. Perhaps more importantly he wrote the work up for a StAndrews DSc on synaptic transmission (59) and published three highly influential reviews inPharmacology Reviews (38), Annual Review of Physiology (54) and British Medical Bulletin (58). Director of the Department of Biological Standards, 1952-58 As Director of the DBS, Perry was responsible to the Department of Health for implementingregulations for the production of all substances controlled under the Therapeutic SubstancesAct and to the WHO as custodian of all the International Standard Preparations other thanthose for vaccines, antisera and antitoxins held by the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen.Virtually automatically, at the age of 31 years, he became a member of the BritishPharmacopoeia Commission and of the Expert Committee on Biological Standardisation ofthe WHO.Walter Laing Macdonald Perry 207 on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from When stocks of one of the International Standard Preparations ran low, the DBS had to supervise the preparation of the replacement batch and to organize bioassays performed by several laboratories in different countries. It is vital, for instance, that the potency of a knownvolume of insulin used by a diabetic remains constant. Thus each new batch of insulin wasassayed by the manufacturer against a sample of the International Standard for insulinobtained from Perry's department. The preparation of a new Standard involved the determi-nation of the precise weight of the new material required to match the potency of the previousStandard (21). The DBS was responsible for supervising the assays performed by the manufacturers. In the main this involved inspection of the manufacturer's protocols and occasional visits to amanufacturer's premises. However, the DBS had to be capable of following up spot-checks byre-assaying the manufacturer's material. All of this involved a fair amount of administrationbut Perry, like his predecessor, managed to continue to be involved in the departmentalresearch, working with W. E. Brocklehurst, H. Reinert, D. A. Long, J. H. Humphrey (FRS1963), R. L. Rowland and others on modulators of the immune response (16, 17, 44) and thetoxicity of drugs containing mercury (14, 22-24). In his note of appreciation for the Board ofthe NIBSC, Derek Bangham also draws attention to Perry's development of assays to detectthe deterioration of biological materials during storage. Today, corticotropin (ACTH, adreno-corticotrophic hormone) is used mainly in a biochemical test of adrenal gland insufficiency,which requires the injection of an accurately predetermined dose and the assay of hydrocorti-sone in the patient's plasma. However, before the widespread introduction of glucocorticoidssuch as dexamethasone, it was used to treat pituitary insufficiency and to increase the releaseof endogenous corticosteroids in the treatment of inflammation and immunosuppression.Manufacturers bought up huge supplies of ox and pig pituitaries to make crude clinical prepa-rations of modest potency. Although a simple improvement in the manufacturing led to a muchpurer and more potent preparation, the potency of individual doses proved completely unpre-dictable in the clinic. The bioassay of the International Standard required the preparation oflarge batches of uniform young rats whose pituitary had been surgically removed. After theirrecovery they were killed and their adrenals assayed for ascorbate following the injection ofthe ACTH preparation. The release of glucocorticoids is followed by a predictable reductionin ascorbic acid. After a considerable amount of work Perry discovered that the problem wastwofold: the instability of the International Standard distributed to manufacturers and thedegradation of the material distributed in ampoules to clinicians. The remedy involved the pro-duction of 48000 freeze-dried ampoules that were distributed throughout the world as theInternational Standard for the next 20 years. Perry was responsible for developing and runninga facility for producing and freeze-drying 4000 ampoules at a time. Together with Nils Jerne,the Head of Biological Standards in Copenhagen mentioned above, Perry wrote the seminalpaper on assays for determining the stability of biological materials (50). The degradation ofthe samples was shown to be accelerated by heat, and their rate of inactivation in good stor-age conditions was predictable with the Arrhenius equation. Thus, Perry and Jerne producedthe earliest WHO requirements for the manufacture of biologically active material. Later, NilsJerne won the Nobel Prize for his work in immunology. In his 1954 report to the Council ofthe Medical Research Council (MRC), Perry highlighted the expanding need for the labora-tory control of biologicals and interestingly insisted that such work should be directly fundedby the MOH and performed by specialized staff, not MRC staff funded to do research.However, he felt that the maintenance of the International Standards should remain with the208 Biographical Memoirs on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from research staff of the DBS. This led eventually to the formation of the Division of Immunological Control, which together with the greatly enlarged DBS combined in 1972 tobecome the NIBSC (Bangham 2002). Unfortunately, his involvement in the research he enjoyed was effectively brought to an end by the introduction in the USA of the Salk vaccine for poliomyelitis. The vaccine had beenmade possible by the demonstration by Enders, Weller and Robbins (Weller et al. 1952; Robbins et al. 1952) that the virus could be grown in tissue culture. The Salk vaccine was pro- duced by growing the virus on cultured monkey kidney cells, harvesting the virus from mon-key kidney tissue and killing the virus with formalin (Salk 1977; Salk & Salk 1977). This wasa delicate business, because too much formalin destroyed the antigenicity and too little failedto kill all of the viruses. Most virologists were extremely sceptical and advised waiting untilattenuated strains (Sabin 1965, 1969) were available that could be used as an alternative to theSalk vaccine. However, this advice was ignored and Salk, with funding from the March ofDimes, mounted a trial of his new vaccine in several thousand children in the USA. To fulfil the foreseen need for the new vaccine several large pharmaceutical companies in the USA and Britain began preparations for manufacturing the vaccine. In anticipation of therole of his department in testing the new vaccine for both efficacy and safety, Perry persuadedthe MRC to build a new animal house to hold hundreds of monkeys and provide funding toallow him to recruit a virologist. When the American trial proved successful, two British com-panies, Burroughs Wellcome and Glaxo, began to prepare batches of vaccine to be trialled onchildren in Britain the following year. The laboratory tests took several months. The absenceof live virus was assayed with tissue cultures of monkey kidney, and the antigenicity by meas-uring the level of antibody raised in live monkeys. All the tests had to be developed from scratch. Up until this time viruses had been cultured in eggs; cultured mammalian cell substrates were completely novel. In the USA, the NationalInstitutes of Health were also struggling to devise tests, and the work in the UK on the Salkand Sabin live virus had to go ahead without their help. An additional requirement was for anassay of neurovirulence using rhesus monkeys. The monkeys were treated with ACTH todiminish their immunological response, and sample doses of the vaccine were injected directlyinto their spinal cord. Some days later the spinal cord was examined histologically for evi-dence of cell damage. Perry was supported by a specially assembled MRC committee of thecountry's leading virologists. However, he took total responsibility for the laboratory work, itsevaluation, its administration and dealing with the MOH and the manufacturers. Just as the UK trial was about to go ahead the news broke that in the USA there had been a tragic accident and more than 100 children had been infected by the vaccine from one of thecompanies, Cutter Laboratories, and 12 had died. There was no doubt that Cutter had per-formed all the required testing and an infected batch of vaccine had slipped through the screen.The injection campaign in the USA continued and the annual epidemic of polio was muchreduced. The trial in the UK showed that the British vaccine worked, and plans were made for a cam- paign in the UK (52). However, it was clear that the British production would be inadequateand millions of doses were purchased from the USA. Perry insisted on retesting the first batchof vaccine imported from the USA. However, the Government, which had promised to protectall children at risk, bought many more doses and distributed these without waiting for Perry'scertification. As chance would have it, a particular batch, from the same manufacturer as theuncertified material used during the campaign, proved one or two months later to contain liveWalter Laing Macdonald Perry 209 on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from virus. By bypassing Perry, the Government had taken an appalling risk in order to appease the public. In spite of his misgivings, Perry proved an effective diplomat in the USA and organized the additional purchases from the US manufacturers. Once the trials and campaign got under wayhe was in continuous demand for press conferences, radio and television interviews and end-less press telephone calls. The constant political and public pressure associated with the ongo-ing polio vaccine campaign effectively ended Walter's research activity and he began to lookfor a career change. Although he was tempted by a generous offer from industry he was per-suaded at a meeting of the British Pharmacopoeia Commission by Sir Derrick Dunlop to con-sider the Chair of Materia Medica in the Department of Pharmacology at Edinburgh, which heaccepted. Gaddum, the previous holder of the chair, had accepted an appointment to becomethe Director of the Agricultural Research Council's laboratories in Babraham, nearCambridge. Gaddum's work with Dale has already been mentioned in connection with Perry'smove to the Department of Physiology at NIMR. UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH , 1958-68 Department of Pharmacology The Chair and Department of Materia Medica in Edinburgh had a distinguished history datingfrom 1768. Perry was only the tenth Professor in 200 years (65) (Gaddum 1962) and his imme-diate successors were, in order, Sir Robert Christison, Sir Thomas Fraser FRS, A. R. Cushny,A. J. Clark and Gaddum, charting rather nicely the foundations of modern pharmacology inthe UK. Perry's appointment in 1958 in many ways reflected the University of EdinburghMedical School's policy at that time, of filling chairs with graduates from all over the UK andfocusing on excellence rather than hiring its own graduates. There is no doubt Perry had 'ahard act to follow'; doubly so because Gaddum and his colleagues, who included V ogt, M. L.Holzbauer and D. F. Sharman, had 'owned' a considerable amount of the equipment in thedepartment and had either taken it with them to Babraham when they moved or planned to doso. (I doubt if this troubled Perry because the move gave him an opportunity to ask the uni-versity for funding to recruit new staff and buy more suitable equipment.\u2014J.S.K.). Perrywrote: Gaddum was such a good experimentalist that he could make significant studies using as equipment little more than a smoke drum, an organ bath, string and sealing wax. My research work called for electronic recordingequipment. The only way of stimulating a nerve was to use an induction coil. I don't think there was athermionic valve in the department. Perry persuaded Bernard Ginsborg to join the department, bringing his detailed knowledge of the biophysics of the neuromuscular junction and more importantly the design and building of electronic equipment. (I can still remember when working with equipment inherited byBernard Ginsborg when David Whitteridge FRS retired to Oxford, changing the gain of theamplifier by stretching into its innards through a cowling that resembled the nose of a Spitfireand exchanging a pentode valve.\u2014J.S.K.) Henry Adam, Tom Crawford, Dick Barlow and R. P. Stephenson continued their own research programmes. These, in many ways, followed the Gaddum approach to both scienceand equipment. With his knowledge of bioassay and his work with Paton on drugs that mod-210 Biographical Memoirs on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from ified synaptic transmission, there is no doubt that Perry made a major contribution to their work. He also introduced a new area of research into the mediators of the inflammatoryresponse by recruiting Brocklehurst from NIMR (60, 62) and David Colquhoun from Leeds.Even as a PhD student Colquhoun added significantly to Walter's expertise in statistics and,many departments later, he is now a Fellow of The Royal Society and an authority on themathematical treatment of drug receptor interactions at the single ion channel level. Underlying Perry's work with Paton and others on drugs attenuating synaptic transmission in the peripheral nervous system (32, 34) there was an unshakable belief that the same princi-ples could be used to unravel the workings of the brain (21, 27, 29, 33). Under Gaddum, V ogt,Adam and Crawford had established a number of bioassays and physico-chemical methods forassaying amines and some of their metabolites in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of largemammals. Elsewhere, Carlsson (Carlsson et al. 1957) had suggested changes in brain amine levels could modify animal behaviour, and Hornykiewicz (Ehringer & Hornykiewicz 1960;Ehringer et al. 1960) had shown at post-mortem that the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease are depleted of dopamine. Others had suggested that the urine and cerebrospinal fluidof patients with schizophrenia contained abnormal and unidentified materials. Against thisbackground Perry persuaded the MRC to establish, in the department, one of its flagship exter-nal multidisciplinary laboratories, the Brain Metabolism Unit. Perry (68) writes, 'I had alwaysbelieved that mental diseases would be found to have a biochemical deficit as their maincause; and I wanted to compare changes in the composition of cerebrospinal fluid obtainedfrom patients by lumbar puncture [(64)] with experimental fluid obtained from the experi-mental animals.'This required not only laboratory facilities but access to beds in an active psy-chiatric unit. Perry appointed a clinician, George Ashcroft, to run the Unit and adopted the titleof Honorary Director. Although he claimed that his role was entirely passive, Perry made ahuge contribution to the infrastructure required for the work and was responsible for promot-ing it throughout the UK. He found the funds to rehouse the department and the Unit togetherin a new building with state-of-the-art laboratories and complete with an animal house capa-ble of looking after mammals with indwelling catheters. The earliest work of the Unit wasvery encouraging, and some of this early work remains of interest today. In today's rathermaterialistic language the Unit was the nucleus of a huge injection of cash for research, infra-structure and funds for new buildings into the Medical School. The Unit's enthusiasm for care-ful state-of-the-art research attracted many scientists to Edinburgh to work not only in the Unitbut alongside it. Many of those at the cutting edge of the development of genetics and imag-ing in psychiatry today spent their formative years in the department and the Unit. (My ownreturn to Edinburgh in 1985 was based almost entirely on the ethos of the Unit's presence inthe department. The closure of the Unit in 1999 was a great disappointment to me.\u2014J.S.K.) Teaching at Edinburgh The department had a long tradition of taking teaching seriously. Both Gaddum and Clark hadplayed a key role in the teaching of pharmacology to medical students in Edinburgh and else-where. Cushny, Clark and Gaddum had all written single-author textbooks which they revisedregularly and which, in one form or another, still exist today. (However, the existence of anexcellent and even witty text written by the Head of Department was not, in my experience inEdinburgh, a sure-fire recipe for memorable lectures. Pharmacology was no exception.\u2014J.S.K.) Thus, Perry's account of his great success as a lecturer to medical students\u2014'I wasgreeted by cheering and stamping'\u2014was undoubtedly correct. He was well aware of the poorWalter Laing Macdonald Perry 211 on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from standard of lecturing in the department and writes, 'I also persuaded my colleagues that one or two of then should attend my lectures and criticize them; and that this habit should applyto all teachers.' However, even at this point in his career, Perry doubted the value of whole-class lectures as a teaching tool. He also questioned the value of formal end-of-term examsthat involved the entire staff of the department marking three or four scripts from each studentin a class in excess of 200. This led him to an experiment in which 50% of the class werebanned from the formal lectures but still attended the fairly comprehensive practical classes,live demonstrations and tutorials. At the end of the year the first multiple-choice questions(MCQs) ever used in Edinburgh were added to the normal of diet of essay-style exam ques-tions. The essays were marked externally and internally and the results were compared withthe outcome of the MCQ exam. The results were very gratifying: the group of students bannedfrom the formal lectures did rather better than the other half of the class. On a single-studentbasis the results of the MCQ correlated almost perfectly with the essay results and, one sus-pects, their university entrance qualifications (61, 63, 66). Perry, with the aid of Stephenson, maintained an extensive collection of MCQs, each scored for their ability to identify the students' rank order in the class against their averagemarks in a number of essay-type examinations held during the first four years of the medicalcourse. The genie was out of the bottle, and the Edinburgh Faculty of Medicine authorizedMCQ examinations as a reliable examination technique. Interestingly, the new medical cur-riculum for the twenty-first century is still based on a substantial number of formal lectures.Ironically, one of the most bitter and long-lasting arguments in the College of Medicine hasbeen about the small number of lecture slots allocated to clinical pharmacology. Perry's interest in education led to his appointment to the Faculty Curriculum Committee charged with reviewing the medical curriculum. The great debate, which continues to this day,was about the balance between teaching medical science and teaching the study of patients.On this occasion the teaching of science was reinforced and a preliminary degree of Bachelorof Medical Science after three years' study was introduced. This enhanced the status of theIntercalated BSc honours courses in which the more able students could take a year out of themedical course to study a scientific subject in depth. At the beginning of this period, recruit-ment to the Honours courses was limited to 10% of the class; today the norm is between 70%and 80% of the class. Perry's argument was that most of Edinburgh's graduates at that timewere destined to be consultants rather than general practitioners and would hold honorary sen-ior lecturer appointments in medical schools. Perry was included in a three-man team sent totour the medical schools of the USA. He describes his trip with Sir Derrick Dunlop and SirJohn Bruce as 'a bit of a Rakes' progress. Hard work during the day followed by \"a littlerefreshment\"'. In 1949, Walter had joined the British Pharmacological Society and when in Edinburgh served the Society well during a fairly crucial time in its development, first as Secretary(1957-61), then as Foreign Secretary (1959-60), and a member of the committee (1961-63)and was editor of the Society's journal from 1955 to 1960. In 1993 the Society awarded himthe Wellcome Gold Medal. University administration Perry describes his first entry into university administration in the early 1960s as an attemptto understand the distribution of money by the University Grants Committee (UGC). Althoughthe UGC gave no indication as to how they arrived at the amount awarded to each university,212 Biographical Memoirs on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from Perry developed a formula that seemed to describe the resource allocation model used by the UGC. Over a range of universities he weighted the student numbers by cost per student on thebases that veterinary and medical cost three times as much as an arts student and showed thatthere was a linear relationship between the amount awarded to each university and theweighted number of students. In an article in the Glasgow Herald he drew attention to the fact that only Glasgow and Edinburgh University were not on the line and that Edinburgh was allo-cated \u00a31 million below the amount predicted by the line. Although the UGC denied the use ofa formula or the discrepancy highlighted by Perry, Edinburgh's next quinquennial grant wassizeably increased. In 1965, Perry was appointed the preclinical Dean responsible, in particular, for the admis- sion system and the records of student performance kept in the Faculty office. Perry drewattention to the high drop-out rate of about 15% and attributed this to the policy of admittingthe sons and daughters of graduates and doctors, many of whom performed poorly. This hadentailed a great deal of work in sorting through each cohort of students. Perry reorganized therecord-keeping so that a similar analysis would be more efficient in the future. When Sir Edward Appleton, the Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the university, died sud- denly, Michael (later Lord) Swann FRS succeeded him and decided to appoint two part-timeVice-Principals, one of whom was Perry. His main function was to deal with resource alloca-tion and postgraduate studies. He quickly discovered that because of the seniority of most ofthe staff at the university, a very large fraction of any new money went to pay annual salaryincrements to the senior staff. The answer was simple; any new appointments had to be at thelowest level on the incremental scale and, if not, any difference in the cost was deducted fromthat Faculty's share of any new money. This incurred the wrath of the medical faculty, whofelt they were obliged to make appointments at a relatively senior level in part in fulfilment oftheir commitment to the clinical departments in the hospital. In the spring of 1968, Perry's attention was drawn by his son to an advertisement for the first Vice-Chancellor of the Open University. Although at first sceptical, he was persuaded thatthe Planning Committee was serious. In the application he was asked to write a short note onwhat he thought the Open University could accomplish. According to his own account hewrote: I was all too aware of the poor quality of much university teaching. It struck me that if courses could be pre- pared that would be of high quality and would be available on TV and radio and in bookshops, teachers in con-ventional universities might be shamed, or pressured by their students, to do rather better. When he accepted the appointment most of Perry's colleagues told him he was mad. Michael Swann, who like everyone else was sceptical about the survival of the new university, com-plimented him by saying that if anyone could make it work, it was Perry. THEOPENUNIVERSITY , 1968-80 The early history Many people lay claim to the basic idea of an open university. But there can be no argumentthat Walter Perry was the man who built the UK's Open University (OU) from scratch in 1969to a university of nearly 100000 students by the time of his retirement in 1980\u2014one with highacademic standards and offering a wide range of courses, including mathematics, science andtechnology.Walter Laing Macdonald Perry 213 on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from Following Harold Wilson's proposal for 'a university of the air' in 1963, the idea had a chequered history over the next few years, becoming something of a political football. After Labour's election victory in October 1964, Wilson gave Jennie Lee the responsibility fortaking the concept forward in March 1965. But there was still some opposition within theGovernment until it was included in the Labour manifesto for the 1966 election, which Labourwon again. Jennie Lee remained the driving force for the new university, against oppositionfrom the Conservatives\u2014Iain Macleod described it as 'blithering nonsense'\u2014and from manypeople in the conventional university and adult education worlds. The crucial decision to goahead was coupled with the appointment of a Planning Committee in September 1967. Writing in 1976, Perry (67) describes how he came first to think about the OU. He had developed an interest in distance teaching at Edinburgh, giving some students a reading listcoupled with organized seminars; as mentioned earlier, he found that these students did just aswell as if not better than those taught traditionally in formal lectures. He also introduced com-puter marking of multiple-choice questions in examinations. To quote Sir John Crofton, thenDean of the Medical School at Edinburgh, Perry 'drew conclusions which were important laterat the OU, that distance learning could not simply be left to reading, but had to include videosand other modern equipment to take the place of lectures.' After a successful term of office as Vice-Principal at Edinburgh, Perry was thinking in terms of a possible vice-chancellorship in a conventional university. But seeing the advertise-ment for the new post of OU Vice-Chancellor he began to think seriously about it. After con-sulting the Labour MPs Tam Dalyell and Jennie Lee, he decided to apply. Founding Vice-Chancellor Perry was appointed in May 1968, and the OU was formally established at a charter ceremonyat The Royal Society in July 1969. The first Chancellor, Lord Crowther, memorably describedthe OU as a university 'open as to people, open as to place, open as to methods, open as toideas'. Coupled with Jennie Lee's insistence that 'nothing but the best would do', this wasvery much the philosophy of Walter Perry. The magnitude of the task involved in setting up the OU could have been daunting for many people, but not to Perry. He led from the front in appointing academic and administra-tive staff, establishing the university structure and regional offices, initiating the operationalside of course production, liaising with the Planning Committee and putting in place the part-nership with the BBC. In all this work he was greatly helped by his new University Secretary,'Chris' Christodoulou. As Tyrell Burgess (Burgess 2003) has said, 'together they were unstop-pable'. His style was essentially hands-on and informal. He was at his happiest in leading fromthe front and doing things, or having things done, preferably his way. But not the least important role of the new Vice-Chancellor was the political one, remain- ing in close touch with the Wilson Government and the Department of Education and Science(DES). This was a different relationship from the one that Perry had known at Edinburgh,which, like all the conventional universities, was funded through the UGC, somewhat remotefrom Government. Not so for the OU, directly funded by the DES. Towards the end of the Wilson Government, Roy Jenkins and the Treasury had come to view the OU as something of a Harold Wilson gim-mick and wanted to restrict the expenditure and size of the OU. But with support from EdwardShort, the Secretary of State, and Jennie Lee, Perry obtained agreement in 1969 to admit25000 students to the OU in 1971. After the change in Government in 1970 he was faced with214 Biographical Memoirs on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from similar opposition again from the Treasury\u2014Iain Macleod was Edward Heath's first Chancellor of the Exchequer\u2014and Perry was worried about survival. But he stuck to his guns,and Macleod's successor, Anthony Barber, gave it a reprieve; Perry wrote (67) that he had ear-lier blunted the opposition of Margaret Thatcher (later Baroness Thatcher; FRS 1983), the newSecretary of State for Education, and that this was crucial in the negotiations of 1970. SirFrederick Warner FRS (Warner 2003) confirms this: Lord Crowther, as Chairman of Forte, had an apartment in Grosvenor House where he invited Margaret Thatcher to dine with the OU Officers while she was in Opposition. She gave all the arguments against it [theOU] but fought for it against McLeod when Minister of Education in the 1970 Conservative Government. In all these matters Perry had the active support of Sir Peter Venables, who had chaired the Planning Committee and who had by now become his Chairman of Council. Venables insisted that the university should assert its independence of Government. In his account of the uni-versity (67), Perry acknowledged his respect for Venables and described him as 'one of thetwo best Chairmen I have ever known'. Policy decisions There were several major policy decisions that he was instrumental in making in the early daysof the OU. The first was that although there was to be open entry\u2014school examination qual-ifications not being required\u2014there would be no compromise on standards. The OU degreewas to be comparable and equivalent to that offered by conventional universities in Scotland.Perry also put in place for the first time in the UK a coherent policy for the transfer of creditto the university for higher education successfully completed elsewhere (not least for the manytens of thousands of certificated teachers who wanted to upgrade their qualification to a fulldegree). The second was to teach in a variety of media, through written textual material circulated to all students, through radio and television, through regular submission of assignments,backup tutorials and summer schools (organized by the regional offices), and through homeexperimental kits. This rich mix of excellent instruction remains the reason for the success ofOU teaching. Perry realized that to justify the high development costs of quality learningmaterials, scale was essential in order to achieve cost effectiveness, because those costs weremuch the same whether the course was subsequently studied by, say, 500 or 25000 students. A third major decision was to design a wide range of courses that could be studied as part of a flexible credit-based system for the single first degree of BA. Faculties of Arts,Mathematics, Science and Social Science were established initially and, later, Faculties ofEducational Studies and Technology were added. Lord Perry himself always thought the concept of the course team was 'the most important single contribution of the OU to teaching practice at tertiary level'. Into each team were drawnthe academic course designers and writers, educational technologists and BBC productionstaff. Administrators, publication and regional staff provided help and advice; and most cru-cially, external advisers and assessors became involved at later stages in the approval processfor the course. Thus an OU course became a joint responsibility, not belonging to any one pro-fessor or lecturer, although authorship of the individual units of a course was stated, if theFaculty so decided.Walter Laing Macdonald Perry 215 on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from Science and technology It was a brave decision to teach science and technology at a distance. There were strong objec- tions that these were practical subjects and needed laboratory instruction. These argumentswere countered by some classic illustrations of experiments on television, the introduction ofsummer schools where some supervised laboratory or field experience could be gained, andby home experimental kits designed and made specially by the OU and dispatched to studentsdirectly. Some of these experiments were brilliantly innovational and the whole operation wasexciting and a massive achievement in logistics. Perry vividly describes in his book how vir-tually the whole of the OU staff, from porters to professors and including families and friends,packed the first home experimental kits in the university car park during the Christmas holi-days of 1970, before the new students were admitted in 1971. Subsequently, a large warehouseoperation was established to deal with dispatching the kits, receiving them on return from thestudents, and then maintaining and repairing them in preparation for their use the followingyear. Criticism could still be made that students were not subjected to the full rigours of a nor- mal university laboratory course and it was accepted that this might be true in heavy engi-neering subjects such as civil engineering. But the students were undoubtedly challengedintellectually by the OU's practical instruction. Other subjects Perhaps as interesting as the list of subjects that Perry initiated were those that he decided notto attempt to teach\u2014languages, law, and medicine, although the first two are now included inthe courses that the university offers. For medicine the inability to provide extensive practicalinstruction must have been the prime reason, but Perry subsequently argued that it could havebeen done in short initial first-degree preclinical courses followed by updating in continuingeducation throughout a later professional career. Research Perry was insistent that research should figure strongly within the university, and he appointedseveral professors with strong research records. However, it was accepted that in the earlyyears the emphasis would be on the preparation of teaching materials, and staff would needsupport to keep their research going. Perry therefore used university funds to provide sup-porting research staff and students, and on the basis of this special university support he per-suaded the Research Councils that applications for grants from OU staff would be consideredon the same basis as those emanating from conventional universities. This was no smallachievement and demonstrated Perry's strong commitment to research. Restrictions on building meant that it did not prove possible to establish substantial research laboratories in all subjects. In some areas where large laboratories were not required,research schools did develop\u2014in psychology and mathematics for example. Perry alsostressed the openings for interdisciplinary research, and some such groups, for example anenergy research group, not requiring laboratory space were set up. But good research labora-tories were built in some particular disciplines, notably in biology and Earth sciences. (WalterPerry would have been delighted with the entrepreneurial Beagle 2 venture of ColinPillinger\u2014a Fellow of The Royal Society with his own swash-buckling style.) In some subjects it proved possible for staff to undertake first-class research with other uni- versities and organizations\u2014for example in physics with CERN in Switzerland\u2014again with216 Biographical Memoirs on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from central university funding assistance. Many members of staff in regional offices continued to conduct their research, sometimes through neighbouring universities. One regional directorwrote a major authoritative book on Roman Britain, which has become one of the most widelyread volumes on the subject. Research students were accepted both on the central campus, and in remote locations in the regions, where they could be supervised jointly by an OU staff member and a colleague atanother university or in industry. At present there are some 35000 postgraduate students reg-istered with the OU world-wide, in addition to the 150000 undergraduates. Academic freedom Perry was always a strong advocate of academic freedom but he saw early on that such free-dom might be in danger of being compromised by the course team concept, for both staff andstudents. There was an opportunity for biased views to be included in course material and cir-culated nationally, far beyond the confines of a lecture room in a conventional university.Theoretically, the OU could become a polemical instrument in itself, advocating support for aparticular political line. Perry realized that constant vigilance was needed at university level,through a system of external monitoring and assessment in addition to the normal policy ofexternal examiners for each course. This concern was to be confirmed later when the univer-sity encountered difficulties with accusations of academic bias, both during Perry's Vice-Chancellorship and later, after his retirement from the scene. The OU strongly andsuccessfully defended its academic freedom on these occasions, although it needed substan-tial mobilization of support nationally on the latter occasion, in the 1980s. Hard work followed by success The early development of the OU required an enormous amount of work from the many peo-ple who joined Perry's band of inventors and explorers, and they were devoted to him. But thedrive, enthusiasm and energy came from the top. Throughout 1969 and 1970 the new Vice-Chancellor worked 18 hours a day and seven days a week, apart from a weekly round of golfat the Woburn course in the new city of Milton Keynes, to which Perry had engineered thetransfer of the OU from its original location in Belgrave Square. He suffered, but fully recov-ered from, a coronary thrombosis in December 1970. Sir Frederick Warner (Warner 2003)remembers this occasion: Perry [was given] a hard time by some OU leftists, particularly at a Planning Committee where he ended the day red and speechless from his first heart problem. Later at his son's wedding in Edinburgh he had a massiveheart attack and was saved by a former colleague who had heroin in his doctor's bag. The reward for him and his colleagues came in the remarkable response in applications when the OU opened its doors to students: 40000 people applied in 1970 for the 25000 places. It was a major logistical success for those new students to receive their course material andstart on their new degree courses in January 1971. It set the pattern for all that was to follow;there was now a huge cohort of students demanding that new courses be available as quicklyas possible so that they could complete their studies. The first of them graduated at the end of1972, and the first national degree ceremony at Alexandra Palace in the summer of 1973 wasa particularly proud moment for Perry. Under Walter Perry's leadership the university continued to grow successfully throughout the 1970s, primarily in the undergraduate school. A small start was made in the delivery ofWalter Laing Macdonald Perry 217 on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from post-experience courses and Perry asked Peter Venables, who had now retired as Chairman of Council, to chair a committee to formulate a blueprint for the future development of a full pro-gramme of continuing education. But developments in continuing education at postgraduatelevel were not to follow until the 1980s. However, Perry initiated activities overseas, advisingother countries on setting up open universities\u2014well over a dozen must have received crucialguidance from him\u2014and he also set up a commercial arm for the sale of OU material. He much enjoyed travelling overseas to meet other distance teaching colleagues, but attempts to establish an American open university were not successful, much to his personaldisappointment. He also undertook a limited number of personal outside activities\u2014for exam-ple he joined the Board of the Encyclopedia Britannica and enjoyed transatlantic flights in Concorde to attend board meetings in Chicago. But his main focus remained within the university he had established with such success. He was a great first Vice-Chancellor of a very special university, and on retirement in 1980 he lefta Rolls-Royce machine, purring along after the great alarums and excitement of the early days. THE THIRD CAREER , 1981-2003 On his election to the House of Lords, Perry had taken up his new duties with his usual enthu-siasm and energy. He had joined the Social Democratic Party and became its spokesman in theLords on education, health and social security in the period 1983-91. But his major role wasas a member of the Select Committee on Science and Technology (from 1985 to 1990 andfrom 2000 to 2001), including Sub-Committee II (Science and Society), from 1999 to 2000,and Sub-Committee IIA (Human Genetic Databases), from 2000 to 2001. He chaired theenquiry into the medical uses of cannabis, which in 1998 recommended that the Governmentallow doctors to prescribe cannabis\u2014'though cannabis should remain a controlled drug, thelaw should be changed to allow doctors to prescribe an appropriate preparation of cannabis ifthey saw fit'. This was promptly rejected by the Government. However, the report marked ashift of opinion and in 2001 the committee recommended faster progress towards cannabis-based medicine. He also took a keen interest in the welfare of seafarers and fishermen. His remarks in the House of Lords on overfishing in 1995 made a considerable impact on both sides of theAtlantic and as late as 2003 saw the publication of a paper (Eagle & Thompson 2003) entitled'Answering Lord Perry's question: dissecting regulatory fishing'. Although he was not a mem-ber of the House of Lords Committee on Animal Experimentation, he attended every debateand committee meeting in the Lords that was relevant to animal research and took everyopportunity to argue the case. At the time of his death, Lord Perry was President of the Research Defence Society and had been for 10 years (1993-2003). He was also a past Chairman (1979-83) and had been a com-mitted member for 40 years He was a tireless defender of the work of Huntingdon LifeSciences and delighted in confronting anti-vivisectionists by asking them whether, if they orone of their family were seriously ill, they would be prepared to benefit from the results ofresearch that could not possibly have been carried out without the use of animals. TheResearch Defence Society will miss his active participation and leadership.218 Biographical Memoirs on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from CONCLUDING REMARKS Perry the man [J.S.K.] Perry was a man of great charm and charisma. He had the knack of putting people at their ease that was quite unusual, coupled with the capacity to insist, when it mattered, and in quite a toughway, that they must do what they ought to do. He enjoyed congenial company and was probablyonly comfortable and happy when he had it. Much of his university business in Edinburgh wasaccomplished in the university's staff club, either on the squash court or in the dining room andbar. He was master in his own habitat and was most at ease when surrounded by his colleaguesand sure of their esteem. He had a very easy way with students and when meeting with themnever gave the impression that he had better things to do elsewhere. However, his attempts to putthem at their ease were sometimes a little gauche. He was not in any way an absent-minded pro-fessor but he had that kind of donnishness, although there was nothing bookish about him. Hewas an excellent host and his parties for the current year's honours students were an annual high-light for young members of the departmental staff. Rumour had it that Perry's takings at pokerfrom the students more than paid for the drink consumed. In the evening after a day of scientificmeetings he was a renowned musical performer and in his younger days had a remarkably clearand assured voice much suited to singing Schubert's Lieder. At the celebration of Perry's deathin Edinburgh two of his sons, Alan and Rob, sang 'Say, Watchman, What of the Night?' withalmost equal clarity but rather less assurance. He loved performing and was a keen member ofthe Savage Club and the Scottish Arts Club, and they provided modestly critical outlets for histalent. He loved melodramatic ballads, but the important thing for him was to guy or camp it upquite a lot; sense of humour was more important than musicality. Such was Walter's personality that several of the authors of his obituaries (Anon. 2003 a; Anon. 2003b; Burgess 2003; Dalyell 2003) were tempted to describe this by making a directlink between his personal qualities and the effort that was required to establish the OU\u2014tena-cious, tactful and tough. Another portrayal (Harvie 2003), much nearer the mark, likens himto one of Frederick the Great's Generals: 'a rough Scots profile, with eyes that are secondguessing the opposition, three or four moves ahead'. Although close this is still not quite cor-rect because Walter, regardless of the opposition, whether it were Minister of the Crown, Deanof Medicine, stroppy senior lecturer, honours student or a very young daughter, had to win nomatter the game and no matter the prize. This he did with such enthusiasm, grace, boyishcharm and modesty that it was impossible for the loser not to join in the celebrations. Indeed,he was comfortable only if he could win gracefully. However, the loser was as often as not infor another surprise, as at the next airing of the issue Walter changed his game plan andadopted his opponent's argument as his own; of course, this is a pretty universal trait amonggames players, and he was a determined games player. It is said that he took the view that get-ting his colleagues to agree on anything was always difficult; however, it was seldom difficultto herd them in the direction he wanted them to go because they were usually totally oblivi-ous to the concept of strategy and tactics. The implication was that it was easy for him to gethis own way. As a card player he no doubt counted the votes, didn't hold votes unless he wasconfident of winning, and was capable of a little arm-twisting and horse-trading when the sit-uation required it. In the end I can think of no better testimony to Walter than that of one of his sons: I always thought of him, and still do, as one of the most civilised people I have ever known\u2014because of the courteous way he dealt with people and the way he maintained evenness of tone and self-control and a genuineWalter Laing Macdonald Perry 219 on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from kindliness for absolutely everyone\u2014a kindliness that was obviously a fundamental character-trait. Also I detected steel in him\u2014and I was brought up Calvinistic enough to feel that it isn't civilised if you can't vig-orously oppose what's wrong. He did do that, and I admired that. Walter was working right up until he died in his sleep in his London club, still travelling weekly between London and Scotland. Whenever we met on the train I was amazed by his enthusiasm for all his committees and his anxiety to make an even greater contribution to hisfavourite causes. In June, in spite of his obvious failing health, he just could not wait for thesummer recess to end and a new session to begin. J.H.H. adds: Walter Perry gained great pleasure from his election as a Fellow of The Royal Society, for services to education and science. But he did not play a major direct role in theSociety's affairs, preferring to make his scientific contributions in the Lords and in informaldiscussion meetings such as those of the Foundation for Science and Technology. He regularlyattended the Society's dinner meetings at 6 Carlton House Terrace. Perry's warmth and enthu-siasm remained unchanging in these later years, and he had strong views on current politicaland scientific developments. Paradoxically I was to get to know him more closely in the 1990swhen I myself had retired; we spent many enjoyable evenings dining together, following ourrespective daily duties in Westminster and The Royal Society. Perry the scientist [J.S.K.] Perry's scientific career at NIMR lasted rather less than decade. During this short period hesubmitted two theses, one of which won a silver medal, and published approximately 80papers, meeting abstracts and reviews and prepared himself for an exacting career in statistics.Although several of the papers and the reviews are single-authored the number of co-authorson the remaining papers is in excess of 50. Although he himself denigrates his first paper withHawking in The Lancet (5), the paper is beautifully illustrated and gives a very convincing account of the work. His other work with Hawking was highly contemporary and gave himfirst-hand experience of mammalian tissue culture and the injection and management of mon-keys that was to prove so vital in the testing of the killed polio vaccine. His work on the tox-icity of arsenic must have proved more interesting than he suggested later, because heextended these studies when Director of Biological Standards to mercury, which was at thattime and for at least the next decade the main ingredient of the most commonly used diuretic.As Director of Biological Standards his interest in hormones was particularly wide rangingand never too far from the cutting edge of clinical medicine. His interest in the standardiza-tion of ACTH also fed forward into the work on the safety of the polio vaccine in which theimmune responses of the test monkeys were weakened so as to increase their sensitivity to anyviable virus remaining in the vaccine. His work in the Division of Physiology was also wide ranging. His knowledge of bioassay allowed him to become an expert on the bioassay of acetylcholine in a very short time. Thevalue of this work is difficult to appreciate almost 50 years later. The battle to establish thechemical nature of synaptic transmission at sites other than the neuromuscular junction is nowlong over, but at that time the battle involving Sir Jack Eccles FRS and others was still prettyintense and partisan. Undoubtedly, the most interesting and innovative work completed byPerry was with Paton, in which they recorded the electrical activity of synaptic transmissionthrough sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia. In comparison with other work at the time,the evoked potentials from the ganglia were much more complicated than anyone would havepredicted from contemporary views of their function and anatomy. Indeed, unravelling the220 Biographical Memoirs on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from synaptic network within each of the ganglia remains a fertile area of research even today. Earlier, Paton, who was to become Professor of Pharmacology in Oxford, had used severalcustom-synthesized methonium compounds to show that the nicotinic receptors in the gangliawith which acetylcholine interacted were pharmacologically different from those at the neuro-muscular junction. It is only during the past five or six years that it has become clear that thesubunits that make up the nicotinic receptors at separate sites are genetically distinct. Thepharmacological observations made by Paton and others in the UK had led to the introductionof new drugs that allowed the independent control of muscle tension and blood pressure dur-ing surgical anaesthesia. Hexamethonium, which blocked transmission through the sympa-thetic ganglia but had no effect on the muscle tension, was the mainstay of the treatment ofsevere hypertension for about a decade (69). Some of these compounds and their analoguesare still in use today. However, it is now apparent that Perry was more interested in how thisapproach might lead to the discovery of new agents for the treatment of mental illness. Onecan well understand Perry's disappointment when the administrative duties associated with theimporting of the Salk polio vaccine from the USA took him away from the research bench. In Edinburgh, the academic facets of Perry's research at NIMR reappeared with his recruit- ment of Bernard Ginsborg to work on the ganglia and, indeed, the action of drugs at the neu-romuscular junction. He also recruited Brocklehurst from NIMR to continue the Division ofBiological Standardisation's interest in modulators of the response to an immunological chal-lenge. (As an honours student, in these early days in Edinburgh, Perry assigned me two laboratory projects; one to assay 5-hydroxytryptamine on a strip from the rat stomach and another to lookat the actions of strychnine and picrotoxin on the rat spinal cord reflexes. Later, others showedstrychnine to be a specific blocker of glycine-mediated inhibitory transmission, and pictro-toxin to a potent blocker of GABAergic transmission. His idea that this approach would paydividends was a good one.) Although it is clear that Perry had the intellect and manual dexterity to have continued in academic research I think one must come to the conclusion that he was first and foremost apragmatist and at the same time never forgot his training and early experience as a doctor. Isuspect that setting up the MRC Brain Metabolism Unit was not only an intellectual challengeand a continuation of his earlier academic interests but also a genuine desire to find new andbetter treatments for mental illness. As I write I cannot but wonder if he saw the developmentof the OU as another opportunity to improve the training or retraining of medical practition-ers. Perry the Vice-Chancellor [J.H.H.] Walter Perry will be remembered as a distinguished university administrator and foundingVice-Chancellor of the OU. It was in that role that he demonstrated his outstanding qualitiesas a leader, innovator and practitioner. By bringing together academics and educational tech-nologists, supported by professionals in broadcasting, publishing, logistics and administration,Perry was able to achieve a step function in teaching quality and at the same time a massivewidening of access to higher education at costs lower than those found elsewhere\u2014a trulyremarkable achievement and a revolution in the economics of higher education at the time. Itwas Perry's desire to see improvements in the standards of university teaching everywhere thathad motivated him to apply for the post of Vice-Chancellor of the OU in the first place. Thereis no doubt that the OU's course materials and its approach to teaching have had, and continueWalter Laing Macdonald Perry 221 on November 11, 2010 rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from to have, a significant influence on the quality of teaching at other universities in the UK and around the world. Family Perry was married in 1946 to Anne Elizabeth Grant, with whom he had three sons. He mar-ried his second wife, Cathie, in 1971, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. Cathie fol-lowed her own medical career but shared in Walter Perry's achievements at the OU and insetting up Wednesden House as the official residence of the Vice-Chancellor.
