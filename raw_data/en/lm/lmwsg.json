I've always associated the luxurious lather of my sulfate-laden shampoo with clean hair. I was a little hesitant to test sulfate-free shampoo brands. I pictured myself trying to work some watery shampoo formula through my strands and ending up with greasy, stringy, lifeless hair - and I was so wrong! Although free of sulfates, most of the clean shampoo brands I tested had an impressive amount of lather (swapping out sulfates for ingredients like naturally derived surfactants sourced from coconuts). And I loved testing all of the new-to-me scents. This guide features 10 brands of clean and natural shampoo at many different price points, so there's something for everyone! Most brands have an array of shampoo and conditioner formulations for all types of hair, so even if you don't have my hair type, most of the brands I've selected have options for most or all hair types. If you're looking for kid-friendly bath products, head to my post on [non-toxic bath products for kids](https://umbelorganics.com/kids-non-toxic-bath-products/). The post includes shampoo for babies through the older kids, plus non-toxic bubble bath, body wash and more. All of the shampoo brands below work for most children. Beyond bath products, [non-toxic leave-in conditioner and detangler](https://umbelorganics.com/clean-hair-detangler-leave-in-conditioner-for-kids/) is a must! Why Use Clean, Natural, Non-Toxic Shampoo? Your scalp is pretty absorbent...about 4 times more absorbent than the skin on your forearm ( [1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15306291))! A study on hair follicles found that caffeine applied as a solution to the scalp was detected in the bloodstream 5 minutes after application ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3243011/)). So, anything that you apply to your scalp has the ability to get in your body. Sulfates (sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth ether sulfate (SLES)), give drugstore shampoo plenty of foamy lather, yet they're irritating to the scalp. They do a great job of removing dirt and oil from your hair, but in the process, they strip hair of the natural oils that are essential for moisturizing both your hair and scalp. If you color your hair, sulfates in shampoo strip the color from your strands. Sulfate-free shampoo is recommended by top stylists to protect color. Silicones in hair care products may trick you into thinking your hair is silky and full of volume. The truth is that silicones clog hair follicles and coat each strand of hair, inhibiting your hair from getting needed moisture. Clean, natural and organic hair care products (free of sulfates and silicones) are the best way to keep your hair and scalp healthy. Your hair won't be stripped of the protective oils necessary to moisturize, nourish and repair. A few other ingredients to avoid in shampoo and hair care products: - Parabens- Parabens are a type of preservative used to prevent the growth of bacteria and prolong the shelf life of lip balm, deodorant, lotion, and other beauty and personal care products. The most commonly used are methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, isobutylparaben and butylparaben. Based on a study conducted at the University of California Berkeley, researchers found that parabens were able to stimulate breast cancer cell growth, even at concentrations 100 times lower than the natural growth factor heregulin. These findings suggest that paraben exposure doesn't have to be high to lead to cancer growth ( [3](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1409200)). - Phthalates- Phthalates are used to increase the flexibility and transparency in plastics. They're also found in personal care products, and they enhance product absorption, help products stick to your skin and keep fragrance smelling fresh. Researchers speculate that phthalates mimic hormones, interrupting hormone production ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2706654/)). A 2018 review found that current human exposure to phthalates may have effects on the male reproductive system ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30336412)). - Polyethylene glycol- Polyethylene glycol is used to make personal care products thicker and better able to transport moisture to the skin. The manufacturing process and introduce impurities and by-products, such as ethylene oxides and 1,4-dioxane, which are known carcinogenic materials ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4505343/)). - Synthetic fragrance- Synthetic Fragrance tonalide, are linked to hormone disruption ( [8](http://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/synthetic-musks/)). Fragrance formulations also contain phthalates, which are hormone disruptors.
