In doing so, exposure will teach the body how to respond properly if and when the real thing comes along. In other words, to create a biological memory or blueprint on how to address threats in the future. If you're an adult who's ever had a flu shot, you're likely familiar with this concept. When it comes to children, though, things get more complicated. Exposing a grown adult with a fully-formed immune system, is nothing even remotely close to exposing a developing infant or child to an onslaught of chemicals, toxins and trace amounts of multiple viruses and bacteria. The human immune system was intended to develop gradually over time, to react to various substances naturally, in order to learn the most effective ways to protect the body in the future. Real Defenses VS Synthetic It's important to understand that there are vast differences in the \"synthetic\" disease, as compared to the versions that occur organically in humans and nature. Also, vaccines are not introduced to the body in the same manner that they would naturally be. A fitting example of this would be measles. Measles, like many viruses, is acquired via inhalation. However, the vaccine for measles is delivered via injection. This unnatural delivery method exposes the infection to the nervous system, forcing it to respond in ways that complicate other inherent organ and system functions, instead of being naturally processed by the body's immune and lymphatic systems. Common and Frequently Reported Health Problems Some of the most common problems and health concerns associated with modern vaccination include, but are far from limited to: - Auto-immune disorders, early and late-onset - Neurological diseases and severe cognitive conditions - Cancer, tumors and cellular growth abnormalities - Developmental issues Overburdened, Confused Immune System Development One of the fundamental issues with vaccines is that they contain much more than merely small doses of the disease-causing virus or bacterium. They're teeming with chemicals and delivery constituents that the body is wholly unprepared to deal with. These aren't just your run-of-the-mill preservatives, though. We're talking about potentially dangerous non-natural compounds; several of which are known to encourage abnormal cellular activity, compromised neural function and a long list of others. Testing has also identified trace amounts of bacterial and viral contaminants not disclosed in official ingredient lists. Their very presence sends the body's immune response mechanisms into a frenzy, as it struggles to determine which threats to attack, and which to identify as benign. This, especially during infancy and key developmental phases, can open the floodgates to diseases and conditions that have little, if nothing, to do with the issues they are intended to prevent.
