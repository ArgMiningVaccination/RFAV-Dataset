In recent years, Europe has been hit with an ever-increasing number of damaging droughts, sparking forest fires and exhausting aquifers. Nearly one-third of Europeans are affected by water stress, according to the European Environment Agency. That is expected to worsen as droughts become more frequent and more intense with climate change. 2023 seems to be no exception as multiple countries experienced one of the hottest summers ever recorded with wildfires and lack of water supply being a matter of concern for the whole continent. Matti Rantanen is the Director General of the European Paper Packaging Alliance (EPPA). In recent years, Europe has been hit with an ever-increasing number of damaging droughts, sparking forest fires and exhausting aquifers. Nearly one-third of Europeans are affected by water stress, according to the European Environment Agency. That is expected to worsen as droughts become more frequent and more intense with climate change. 2023 seems to be no exception as multiple countries experienced one of the hottest summers ever recorded with wildfires and lack of water supply being a matter of concern for the whole continent. When we have some of the largest and wealthiest countries across the European Union taking strict measures on how much water can be used by their citizens and farmers and Europe's rivers running dry, it seems difficult to justify the measures proposed by the European Commission in its Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) proposal published late last year. The proposal which, among other rules, looks to replace single-use food paper packaging with reusable alternatives for dine-in and takeaway settings does not account in any way for the enormous uptake in freshwater usage that would be required if reusable packaging was made mandatory. Contrary to popular belief, reusable products, particularly when they are made of resource-intensive, non-renewable materials, which need intensive washing and drying systems, compare badly to single-use paper products on both climate contributions and freshwater use. Taking the comparison between paper and reusable packaging for on-site consumption in quick-service restaurants, a life-cycle assessment (LCA) carried out by Ramboll highlights that reusables consume 3.4 times more water than single-use paper packaging. The need to wash reusable tableware hugely increases the amount of water required, with estimates stating that substituting reusable packaging in fast food restaurants would be equivalent to providing 750,000 people with their freshwater needs each year. Additionally, a recent report carried out by the global management consulting firm Kearney shows that reuse models for dine-in would require up to four billion litres of additional water every year. That's equivalent to filling over 1,600 Olympic swimming pools with water per year just to meet demand. Or washing 55,000 cars every day of the year. The impact assessment on which the PPWR was based disregards large swathes of scientific research on single-use paper packaging and reuse and makes unsubstantiated assumptions. The impact of the washing and drying systems as well as the transportation of reusable packaging to and from restaurants have been minimised in the impact assessment. On multiple occasions has the lack of science supporting the Commission's proposal been outlined by Members of the Parliament, baffled by this gross oversight. One example, amongst many, is the assessment's claim that the \"transportation and washing\" CO2 impact of reuse represents only 37% of the total GHG emissions (and 27% in 2040). In reality, it accounts for over 80%, according to third party reviewed Ramboll LCA studies. This type of failed analysis is no basis on which to form policy. Oversimplification and the nonsensical collation of data cannot replace an ISO standard approach, such as the one used in the LCA studies. Against this backdrop, the recent votes from the European's Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Science (ITRE), the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO), and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI), are steps in the right direction, aligned with scientific evidence. Science and evidence must continue to guide the work of policymakers. It is necessary, especially on such a crucial issue as creating a European circular economy and reducing the environmental impact of packaging. By following science, policymakers have a shot at cutting unnecessary freshwater consumption at a time where this finite resource is decreasing drastically. Now that they are back at work after a hot summer, the European Parliament and national governments have a responsibility of ensuring that EU ambitions are science-based to foster the most sustainable and efficient use of resources, without putting food safety, food security and the health of EU citizens at risk.
