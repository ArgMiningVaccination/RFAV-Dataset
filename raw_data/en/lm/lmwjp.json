Our small staff team, guided by CEO Cristal Skaling-Klopstock, work incredibly hard and I cannot praise them highly enough for their continuing loyalty and dedication. For a small charity, we achieve amazing results. \"Guid gear gangs in sma' bulk\" (for our southern readers - \"good things come in small parcels\"). First and foremost has to be our ever-expanding network of charitable clinics around the UK. That these are meeting an obvious need is borne out by the numbers of patients seeking appointments. The clinics provide a valuable resource and we are able to run as many as we can fund and staff. Androulla Pillos-Smith has stepped up from her previous role to that of Clinics Manager and is doing a sterling job. And long-serving staff member T racey Simmons has been holding the fort very ably in the absence of our Business Development Manager. We welcomed two new members of staff this year: Sam Westcott who takes charge of Marketing and Communications and Sarah Indranie as Operations Manager. Both Sarah and Sam bring fresh ideas and enthusiasm and are already making a positive impact. Their arrival coincided with a move to new premises. We have left CAN in Old Street and are now in Bloomsbury, near Kings Cross in London, in a space which is much better suited to our needs. The staff continue to enjoy hybrid working and have also been able to take advantage of a salary sacrifice scheme which enables them to buy an electric car. Thanks to our Royal Patron, HRH The Duke of Gloucester, we once again received an invitation to the Queen's Garden Party at Buckingham Palace. This time, the honour fell to T rustee Liz T ucker and CEO Cristal to represent the charity. Our charity is in good health financially, despite the vagaries of the markets. The Finance Committee and CEO monitor the situation closely, maintaining our operational and financial stability. Fundraising remains difficult post pandemic and we rely on generous legacies and donations from our supporters to continue our work. Our sincere thanks to all who are able to contribute. 5Margaret Wyllie Cristal also chairs 4Homeopathy (4H) in the UK, which was created to help promote and defend homeopathy in a unified way. Homeopathy is an important part of complementary and integrated medicine and for those reasons Homeopathy UK is a signatory on the recent People's Declaration for Complementary and Integrative Health (TCIH), a global call for a person-centred and holistic approach to healthcare. Cristal and I continue to represent Homeopathy UK in Europe, between us taking on major roles in the European Federation of Homeopathic Patients' Associations and the European Committee for Homeopathy, which in turn lead to involvement in other European lobbying groups. This helps to keep H-UK at the forefront of homeopathy and CAM in Europe. Perhaps it's still a little early to cheer, but there has been some positive media coverage for homeopathy during the past year. Maybe the wheel is turning and, as a more integrated approach to healthcare and patient-centredness start to become both desirable and normal, homeopathy will no longer be such an easy target for criticism. Certainly, the public vote with their feet and homeopaths and homeopathic pharmacies have never been busier. Having served two terms as Chair, it is now time for me to stand down and pass the reins to John Morgan who has been a very able Vice-Chair and I know will bring fresh ideas and continue the positive development of H-UK. John is a well-known and highly respected member of our homeopathic community; he is the founder and managing director of Helios Homeopathic Pharmacy and a long-standing Member of the Faculty of Homeopathy and Fellow of the Society of Homeopaths. It has been an honour and a privilege to serve as Chair and I am extremely proud of what we have achieved over recent years. The success and growth that we have enjoyed have only been possible thanks to our dedicated staff and trustees, as well as the tremendous backing we've received from our supporters and friends across the UK. I have met many interesting people, visited some fascinating places and made some lifelong friends. Thank you all for your support, which is very much appreciated. I have every confidence that the organisation will go from strength to strength in the years to come. Long may H-UK continue to pack a powerful punch! 66Our vision is for everyone in the UK to understand the value of homeopathy and be able to access high-quality treatment from registered healthcare professionals.

Through our clinics, we are able to meet our core objective of providing high-quality free (or low cost care to those who would otherwise be unable to access it. All of our clinics are run by experienced practitioners who are registered with one of the UK's main three registering bodies. On average, our charitable clinics run for two half days per month, although this increases where demand is high. This year, our network of nine charitable clinics has continued to go from strength to strength. We have launched two new clinics, rebranded a third and seen a return of face-to-face appointments. New clinics: In February, we opened Scottish Borders Homeopathy in Galashiels run by Society member Luci Joan Lawless. Initially offering one afternoon session per month, the clinic proved so popular that we added a second clinic. We also rebranded our Stranraer clinic as Dumfries & Galloway Homeopathy in February as the clinic moved to a wonderful new location, Catstrand. Practitioner Elaine Hamilton - and her patients - are extremely happy in their new, healing space and the clinic continues to thrive. In May, we opened our UK-wide Virtual Clinic, in direct response to patient demand. The clinic is run by GP and Faculty member Dr Gabriella Day and has been enormously successful from the outset, with high demand for appointments. The clinic is fully booked several months ahead and is clearly providing a much-needed service to patients who cannot afford or access homeopathic care elsewhere. Dumfries & Galloway Homeopathy, CatstrandNorwich Homeopathy, Complementary Health Care9Linking with the local community: Many of our clinicians have forged excellent links within their local community, offering their services through other charities. In January, Dr Tim Foster opened a homeopathy clinic at T rinity Winchester, a day service for homeless and vulnerable people in Winchester. Initially opened as a pilot, the clinic has proved extremely popular and is now a regular fixture at T rinity. Wendy Scrase (Kent) has also forged close links with the nearby community Physic Garden and has seen a steady stream of patients come from there. Farewell: Robin Grenfall-Cowan, one of our longest-standing practitioners, retired from his post at Liverpool Homeopathy this year. We were extremely sorry to see him go and are looking for a suitable replacement. Grant-funded clinics: We also provide funding to a number of specialist clinics: New Veterans' Clinic - in March, we were delighted to support former soldier turned homeopath Gabby Arthur with her new clinic helping military veterans who are struggling to return to civilian life. We also continued to provide much needed support and funding to: Garden Homeopathy - Rix Pyke & Dodo Kitching - an essential service for inner city South London residents run from a yurt in a community garden Battling On - Ian Webster (Cornwall) - this clinic is provided in association with the charity Battling On which supports veterans. The Physic Garden, Kent Garden Homeopathy, South London10Feedback from our clinics is excellent Plans for next year Promote clinics locally (via PR and promotional materials) and digitally (Google My Business and social media ads) to ensure all clinics are fully booked.

This year, we have made some changes to the way in which we obtain these stories and as a result, have seen numbers increase. We use these stories on the success stories section of our website, on social media and in our magazine Health & Homeopathy.

Homeopathy Awareness Week This year, the main audience for our annual campaign was practitioners rather than the public. We engaged the profession with a \"How did you start your homeopathy journey\" campaign, sending packs of branded items including posters, stickers and cards to share with their patients. These posters were photographed and shared to social media. The campaign had good engagement. Other activities 4H has also worked together on short videos of patients on the street talking about how homeopathy has helped them. The Hahnemann House Trust (HHT) As trustee of the HHT , we continue to play a key role in preserving the legacy of homeopathy. The HHT houses a unique collection of letters, books and personal artefacts belonging to Dr Hahnemann - and other key figures from homeopathy's past - which can be viewed free of charge in a virtual museum. (www.hahnemannhouse.org)Collaborate with sector partners 19Our international partnerships We also work closely with international partners to support nations where homeopathy is under threat, helping to ensure that patients can retain access to it. The European Federation of Homeopathic Patients' Associations (EFPHA) - We are members of EFHPA and our CEO Cristal Skaling-Klopstock is the Co-President. Cristal is also the organisation's liaison with the European Committee for Homeopathy (ECH). The European Committee for Homeopathy (ECH) represents homeopathic doctors' organisations across Europe. Homeopathy UK's Chair, Margaret Wyllie and CEO Cristal sit on the ECH Council. Margaret is co- ordinator of the ECH's Documentation subcommittee. Both organisations continue to work hard to improve homeopathy's reputation in the media by sharing patient stories and promoting research which focuses on the benefits of an integrated healthcare approach.

This work was done through the Samuel Goodenough fund which was established to support veterinary homeopathy. Our website outlines some of the key research into homeopathy, as well as providing a comprehensive database of medical conditions (Conditions Directory). Data collected from our charitable clinics is analysed to provide meaningful clinical information.Research and training Training We continue to work closely with The Faculty of Homeopathy to ensure that more doctors, nurses, vets, pharmacists, midwives and other healthcare professionals are trained in homeopathy. Over the year, we have provided The Faculty with funding to increase the number of healthcare professionals undertaking training through events, virtual teaching and lectures. Many of our charitable clinics are run by Faculty members who stay up to date with CPD and other professional obligations through their membership. The Faculty's Congress took place online in September 2021 with attendees from across the globe. The Faculty's 100th Congress is planned for April 2024 and will be not only a UK-wide, but an International homeopathic educational event. 21 21 Plans for next year Enable Faculty students gain clinical experience through our charitable clinics Work with the Faculty to boost its recruitment activities Provide education to public and healthcare professionals through the charitable clinics.

Over the year, we are fortunate to have benefited from generous legacies, grants and donations from the public. Legacies once again represented a considerable percentage of our income 81% vs 61% in 2021. We also received \u00a371,387 in individual donations and grants to support all aspects of our work. We would like to thank the Blackie Foundation T rust, Scottish Homeopathic & Research and Education T rust, Northwest Friends of Homeopathy and Honeyman Gillespie T rust for their on-going support.Fundraising Plans for next year Apply to new T rusts and Foundations to fund key areas of work.

Remuneration of senior staff Senior staff salary levels are initially set when recruiting, through external review by employment experts to ensure salaries reflect the current employment market to attract high- calibre candidates to apply for the posts. Once employed, staff member salaries are reviewed based on changes in responsibilities, performance in post and economic changes. CEO recruitment and salary management is undertaken in a similar manner by the T rustees. Organisational structure (see page 28) There are five staff members, two full- time and three part-time. Homeopathy UK is committed to equal opportunities. Conditions of employment are set out in the staff materials held on the Citrus HR System. Reserves policy The charity relies on legacies and donations or retained reserves to fully fund its activities. Since legacy income is unpredictable in both amount and frequency, the T rustees have agreed that sufficient reserves should be maintained to support the charity's activities for one year. The charity determines an operating deficit by deducting sustainable income from the cost of its planned activity level for the twelve month period, ensuring that sufficient reserves are retained to meet this operating deficit. In this way, planned increases or enforced 26decreases in activity can be managed smoothly. The target reserves for 2022-23 year were \u00a3253,402. At 2021-22 year end the unrestricted free reserves were \u00a3263,456 which is more than the target. If the reserve level goes below the annual budgeted deficit the T rustees will consider the charity's financial position and anticipated income to either modify the reserve policy or implement operational reductions to ensure reserves remain aligned with the current policy. Designated funds of \u00a3143,581 are held to ensure the charity has sufficient funding for on-going grant commitments, clinic operations and redundancy costs should it face an unanticipated, emergency wind down. Restricted funding is used against expenditure that meets the purposes of the funds. Fundraising costs The charity's fundraising costs are directly linked with the salaries of the charity's Business Development team who ensure core processes such as gift processing and donor management are undertaken. The team is also responsible for applying to grant funders to secure funding for both current and new projects as well as identifying how to attract additional funding and new donors to the charity. Grant-making policy In 2015-6, Homeopathy UK started accepting grant applications for future funding. The grant awarding policy and application is available to the public on the organisation's website. Over the period, \u00a315,893 was spent on grants and a further \u00a338,852 was allocated to T rustee approved projects which are on- going or will start in 2022-3. The Faculty of Homeopathy The Faculty of Homeopathy is the only professional body in the UK representing statutorily registered healthcare practitioners who are qualified in homeopathy - doctors, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, podiatrists and vets. The Faculty - which has around 500 members - ensures the highest standards of homeopathic training, education and practice. It is also the leading authority on homeopathic medicine and lobbies government, the medical establishment and other key decision-makers for homeopathy to be fully integrated into healthcare systems the UK and worldwide. Risk management T rustees and senior staff identify risks to the charity on an ongoing basis. These risks have been documented within a risk register that is ranked by severity. This risk register is regularly discussed and updated at T rustee meetings. Where appropriate, systems or procedures have been established to mitigate the risks the charity faces. The significant risks identified are shown on Page 27. Auditors Our auditors are Sayer Vincent LLP . This report has been prepared in accordance with the special provisions relating to small companies within part 15 of the Companies Act (2006). On behalf of the T rustees Mrs Margaret Wyllie Chair Date: 3 May 20232727Risk Identified Key Mitigation/Control Measures The financial security of the charity The Finance Committee meets regularly (at minimum five times a year) to monitor finances and income projections and make recommendations to ensure the charity is secure financially.

Retention of organisational knowledge to ensure objects can be metLong standing staff have job notes to allow others to do key aspects of work. There is a sharing of information with all staff about the history of the charity and affiliated organisations. Potential reputational damage issues to the charity and to homeopathy itselfThere are set policies for staff, contractors and trustees around actions that could damage the charity. The charity has position statements and media trained key staff to be prepared if there is an emergency where a public response is required.

The trustees have adopted the provisions of Accounting and Reporting by Charities: Statement of Recommended Practice applicable to charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) (effective 1 January 2019). Statement of Trustee's responsibilities The trustees (who are also the directors of Homeopathy UK for the purposes of company law) are responsible for preparing the Report of the T rustees and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). Company law requires the trustees to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the charitable company and of the incoming resources and application of resources, including the income and expenditure, of the charitable company for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the trustees are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; observe the methods and principles in the Charity SORP; make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the charitable company will continue in business. 30The trustees are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the charitable company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the charitable company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. In so far as the trustees are aware: there is no relevant audit information of which the charitable company's auditors are unaware; and the trustees have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information. Appointing Trustees The method of appointment of T rustees is contained in the governing documents. T rustees are also members of Homeopathy UK's Council and simultaneously guaranteed members of the company. Before new T rustees are appointed, a review of the T rustee body's skills mix is undertaken and steps taken to recruit new T rustees with skills that fill any gaps. New T rustees are invited to an induction meeting where they receive a comprehensive overview of the charity, its work and governance. T rustees regularly review their need for additional training to effectively fulfil their role. No T rustee has any financial interest in Homeopathy UK, or received any renumeration aside from out-of-pocket expenses. Financial results for year ending 31 August 2022 Net movement in funds was (\u00a348,212) (2021: (\u00a370,284) ). The total reserves of Homeopathy UK stand at \u00a3596,414 (2021: \u00a3644,626) 31Principal activities of the charity All activities undertaken by the charity are of benefit to the public. The T rustees confirm that they have referred to the Charity Commission's general guidance on public benefit and ensured that the charity's aims and objectives are in line with this guidance. The year 2021-22 has been one of achievement against the organisation's strategic goals. For example, the charity has increased the number of charitable clinics it provides - or funds through grants - enabling more people to access high quality homeopathic care from registered healthcare professionals. Over the period, the charity's strategic goals were to: Provide clinics, advice and support to enable patients to access homeopathy. Educate patients about homeopathy through publications and other information. Enhance its digital presence via its website and social media channels. Maintain sound governance and financial security. Grow its supporter base and increase donations through fundraising and donor cultivation. Work with UK and international partners to promote and defend homeopathy. Pages 5-24 outlines the charity's achievement against plans in more detail.32Independent auditor's report to the members of Homeopathy UK Opinion We have audited the financial statements of Homeopathy UK (the 'charitable company') for the year ended 31 August 2022 which comprise the statement of financial activities, balance sheet, statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). In our opinion the financial statements: Give a true and fair view of the state of the charitable company's affairs as at 31 August 2022and of its incoming resources and application of resources, including its income and expenditure, for the year then ended Have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice Have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, the Charities and T rustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 and regulation 8 of the Charities Accounts (Scotland) Regulations 2006 (as amended) Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the charitable company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.Conclusions relating to going concern In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the trustees' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on Homeopathy UK's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue. Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the trustees with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. Other information The other information comprises the information included in the trustees' annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The trustees are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 33 The information given in the trustees' annual report, for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and The trustees' annual report, has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements Matters on which we are required to report by exception In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the charitable company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the trustees' annual report. We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 and the Charities Accounts (Scotland) Regulations 2006 (as amended) require us to report to you if, in our opinion: Adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or The financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or Certain disclosures of trustees' remuneration specified by law are not made; or We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or The directors were not entitled to prepare the financial statements in accordance with the small companies regime and take advantage of the small companies' exemptions in preparing the trustees' annual report and from the requirement to prepare a strategic report. Responsibilities of T rustees As explained more fully in the statement of trustees' responsibilities set out in the trustees' annual report, the trustees (who are also the directors of the charitable company for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the trustees determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the trustees are responsible for assessing the charitable company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the trustees either intend to liquidate the charitable company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements We have been appointed as auditor under section 44(1)(c) of the Charities and T rustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 and under the Companies Act 2006 and report in accordance with regulations made under those Acts. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud are set out below. Capability of the audit in detecting irregularities In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with 34laws and regulations, our procedures included the following: We enquired of management, which included obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the charity's policies and procedures relating to: Identifying, evaluating, and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non- compliance; Detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected, or alleged fraud; The internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non- compliance with laws and regulations. We inspected the minutes of meetings of those charged with governance. We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework that the charity operates in, focusing on those laws and regulations that had a material effect on the financial statements or that had a fundamental effect on the operations of the charity from our professional and sector experience. We communicated applicable laws and regulations throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of non- compliance throughout the audit. We reviewed any reports made to regulators. We reviewed the financial statement disclosures and tested these to supporting documentation to assess compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud. In addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, we tested the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments, assessed whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias and tested significant transactions that are unusual or those outside the normal course of business. Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation. A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report. Use of the report This report is made solely to the charitable company's members as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and section 44(1)(c) of the Charities and T rustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the charitable company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the charitable company and the charitable company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

The charitable company's registered number and registered office address can be found on the Contents page. The presentation currency of the financial statements is the Pound Sterling (\u00a3). Note 2: Accounting policies Basis of preparation and assessment of going concern. The financial statements of the charitable company, which is a public benefit entity FRS 102, have been prepared in accordance with the Charities SORP (FRS 102) 'Accounting and Reporting by Charities: Statement of Recommended Practice applicable for charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) (effective 1 January 2015)', Financial Reporting Standard 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland' and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The T rustees confirm that they have referred to the guidance contained in the Charity Commission's General guidance on public benefit ensuring it is in line with the Charity's aims and objectives. The T rustees consider that there are no material uncertainties about the Charity's ability to continue as a going concern. The principal accounting policies adopted, judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty in the preparation of the financial statements are as follows: Income Income from donations is included in the financial statements on a receivable basis. Pecuniary and residuary legacies are included when the amounts can be reasonably quantified and the charity has certainty of receipt. All other income is accounted on an accruals basis. Income is stated after trade discounts, other sales taxes and net of VAT .Resources expended The charity incurs two main categories of expenditure which are cost of generating funds and charitable activities. All categories of expenditure are accounted for on accruals basis. The cost for generating funds includes fundraising and publicity costs as well as investment management fees. Charitable activities expenditure includes the training of healthcare professionals, provision of information, increasing public access and research and development. a) Direct costs have been directly allocated against the charitable activity to which they relate. b) Grants have been directly allocated against the charitable activity to which they relate. c) Staff costs have been allocated against cost of generating funds and charitable activities on a staff time basis. d) Similarly, support costs have been allocated against cost of generating funds and charitable activities on a staff time basis. A breakdown of the expenditure included within support costs is detailed in the notes to the accounts. Grants awarded Provision is made for grants when approved by the T rustees and communicated to recipients Grants approved and communicated but not paid at the balance sheet date are included in liabilities. T angible fixed assets T angible fixed assets held for the company's own use are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. T angible fixed assets with a value of \u00a3500 or more are capitalised. Depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual values, of all fixed assets, over their expected useful lives. It is calculated at the following rates: Office equipment, fixtures and equipment - 33% reducing balance Computer equipment - 33% reducing balance T axation status The organisation as a registered charity does not incur corporation tax and reclaims any recoverable tax suffered on investment income. The notes on page 39-58-form part of these financial statements. 41Investments Investments are shown at market value. The unrealised movement in market value from one year to another is taken to the appropriate fund. The market value of investments is determined by reference to stock exchange prices at the balance sheet date. Gains or losses arising during the year are disclosed in the Statement of Financial Activities (SOFA). Cash and bank balances Cash held by the charity is included at the amount actually held and counted at the year end. Bank balances, whether in credit or overdrawn, are shown at the amounts properly reconciled to the bank statements. Fund accounting General funds are available for use at the discretion of the T rustees in pursuing the general charitable objectives of the charity and which have not been designated for other purposes.Designated funds comprise unrestricted funds that have been set aside by the T rustees for particular purposes. Restricted funds are created when funds (whether income or capital in nature) are given to, or raised by, the charity for use in a particular area or for a specific purpose only. Endowment Funds These are assets, which must be held permanently by Homeopathy UK. The change to the value of the fund are reflected in the SOFA as realised and unrealised gains or losses. The income from the endowment funds is for the promotion of Homeopathy. During the 2021 financial year, with approval from the Charity Commission and former Samuel Goodenough T rust T rustees, this fund, totalling \u00a360,143 at the date of transfer, was reclassified. Gifts in kind The charity includes individual gifts in kind where these are worth in excess of \u00a3500. Operating leases Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged to the statement of financial resources.Pensions The company contributes to individual staff's pension schemes, whose assets are maintained separately from those of the charity. The pension charge represents the amounts payable by the Charitable company to the funds during the year. All expenses under the pension scheme are included within unrestricted charitable activities. Emoluments The T rustees who are the directors of the company do not receive emoluments for their services nor do contracts of services exist between the T rustees and the Charitable company. Creditors and provisions Creditors and provisions are recognised where the charity has a present obligation resulting from a past event that will probably result in the transfer of funds to a third party and the amount due to settle the obligation can be measured or estimated reliably. Creditors and provisions are normally recognised at their settlement amount after allowing for any trade discounts. Debtors Debtors are measured at their recoverable amounts at the balance sheet date.
