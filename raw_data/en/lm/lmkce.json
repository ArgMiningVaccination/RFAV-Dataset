Vol. 05-5Preface The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is published once each month by the Department of Administration, Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a monthly compilation of all administrative rule-making documents in Idaho. The Bulletin publishes the official rulemaking notices and administrative rule text of state agency rulemakings and other official documents as necessary. State agencies are required to provide public notice of rulemaking activity and invite public input. The public receives notice of rulemaking activity through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and the Legal Notice published monthly in local newspapers. The Legal Notice provides reasonable opportunity for public input, either oral or written, which may be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the Rulemaking Notice published in the Bulletin. After the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all information submitted in regard to the rule. Comment periods are not provided in temporary or final rule-making activities. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is cited by year and issue number. For example, Bulletin 04-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2004; Bulletin 05-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2005. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; Volume No. 04 -1 refers to January 2004; Volume No. 04 -2 refers to February 2004; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January 2005 is cited as Volume 05-1. The December 2004 Bulletin is cited as Volume 04-12. RELATIONSHIP TO THE I DAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is published once a year and is a compilation or supplemental compilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules in effect in Idaho. In an effort to provide the reader with current, enforceable rules, temporary rules are also published in the Administrative Code. Temporary rules and final rules that have been approved by the legislature during the legislative session, and published in the monthly Idaho Administrative Bulletin, supplement the Administrative Code. Negotiated, proposed, and pending rules are not printed in the Administrative Code and are published only in the Bulletin. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect, or to determine if a change has occurred, the reader should refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index of Idaho Administrative Rules , printed in each Bulletin. TYPES OF RULEMAKINGS PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The state of Idaho administrative rulemaking process, governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises five distinct activities: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings involve all five. At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies often engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building in controversial or complex rulemakings. In the majority of cases, the process begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of administrative rule. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interest ed parties and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule. Agencies are encouraged, and in some cases requ ired, to engage in this rule making activity whenever it is feasible to do so. Publication of a \"Notice of Intent to Promulgate - Negotiated Rulemaking\" in the Administrative Bulletin by the agency is optional. This process should result in the formulation of a proposed and/or temporary rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 5 May 4, 2005 - Vol. 05-5PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the agency is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish a \"Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\" in the Bulletin. This notice must include: a) the specific statutory authority (from Idaho Code) for the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the substance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format;d) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule; e) the manner in which persons may make written co mments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to whom comments on the proposal may be sent; f) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation as provided in Section 67-5222, Idaho Code; and g) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule. As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may proceed to the pending rule stage. A proposed rule does not have an assigned effective date unless published in conjunction w ith a temporary rule. An agency may vacate a proposed rulemaking if it decides not to proceed further with the promulgation process. TEMPORARY RULEMAKING Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; orc) conferring a benefit; If a rulemaking meets any one or all of the above requir ements, a rule may become effective before it has been submitted to the legislature for review and the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. However, a temporary rule that imposes a fee or charge may be adopte d only if the Governor finds that the fee or charge is necessary to avoid an immediate danger which justifies the imposition of the fee or charge. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative session unless the rule is approved, amended, or modified by concurrent resolution or when the rule has been replaced by a final rule. State law required that the text of both a proposed rule and a temporary rule be published in the Administrative Bulletin. In cases where the text of the temporary rule is the same as the proposed rule, the rulemaking can be done concurrently as a proposed/temporary rule. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text. An agency may, at any time, rescind a temporary rule that has been adopted and is in effect. If the temporary rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or if it has been published concurrently with a proposed rulemaking that is being vacated, the agency, in most inst ances, should rescind the temporary rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 6 May 4, 2005 - Vol. 05-5PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it become a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Pending Rulemaking\". This includes: a) a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule; b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective; d) an identification of any portion of the rule imposing or increasing a fee or charge. Agencies are required to republish the text of the rule wh en substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that members of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pending rule. With the permission of the Rules Coordinator, only the Section(s) that have changed from the proposed text are re published. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the \"Notice of Pending Rulemaking\" is published. FINAL RULEMAKING A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is in effect and enforceable. No pending rule adopted by an agency will become final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review. Where the legislature finds that an agency has violated the legislative intent of the statute under which the rule was made, a concurrent resolution may be adopted to reject the rulemaking or any part thereof. A \"Notice of Final Rule\" must be published in the Bulletin for any rule that is rejected, amended, or modified by the legislature showing the changes made. A rule that has been reviewed by the legislature and has not been rejected, amended or modified will become final with no further legislative action. No rule shall become final and effective before the conclusion of the regular or special legislative session at which the rule was submitted for review. However, a rule that is final and effective may be applied retroactively, as provided in the rule.

Internet Access - The Administrative Code and Administrative Bulletin are available on the Internet at the following address: http://www2.state.id.us/adm/adminrules/ HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin are organized by a numbering system. Each state agency has a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphabetical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections with a number of subsections. An example IDAPA number is as follows: IDAPA 38.07.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"IDAPA 38\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05, which is the Department of Administrations's Division of Purchasing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to Subsection 200. 02. \"c.\" c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c. ii.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 8 May 4, 2005 - Vol. 05-5DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. All rulemaking actions (documents) are assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The \"Docket Number\" is a series of numbers separated by a hyphen \"-\", (38-0501-0401). The docket numbers are published sequentially by IDAPA designation (e.g. the two-digit agency code). The following example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket: \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-0401\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"0401\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket r eceived during the year; in th is case the first rule- making action in calendar year 2004. Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (see Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numberi ng is broken the following statement will appear: \"(BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS)\" INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CITATIONS TO ADMINISTRATIVE RULES IN THE CODE AND BULLETIN When making a citation to another Section or Subsection of a rule that is part of the same rule, a typical internal citation may appear as follows: \"...as found in Section 201 of this rule.\" OR \"...in accordance with Subsection 201.06.c. of this rule.\" The citation may also include the IDAPA, Title, or Chapter number, as number of the rule. \"01\" denotes the Chapter number of the rule. : \"201\" references the main Section number of the rule that the citation refers to. Citations made within a rule to a different rule chapter (external citation) should also include the name of the Department and the name of the rule chapter being referenced, as well as the IDAPA, Title, and Chapter numbers. The following is a typical example of an external citation to another rule chapter: \"...as outlined in the Rules of the Department of Administration, IDAPA 38.04.041, \"Rules Governing Capitol Mall Parking.\"IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 9 May 4, 2005 -

Providers failing to make a written Demand for Payment within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective dat e of this rule shall be forever barred from invoking the Dispute Resolution Process set forth in the applicable Judicial Rule. Demands and/or billings submitted previously either to the Payor or to the Commission will not suffice.

The action is authorized pursuant to Section 58-104, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be held as follows: Tuesday, October 18, 2005 Thursday, October 20, 2005 6:00 to 8:30 p.m. 6:00 to 8:30 p.m. Idaho Department of Lands 2nd Floor Courtroom, Borah Building 3780 Industrial Avenue South 304 North 8th Street Coeur d'Alene, Idaho Boise, Idaho The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explana tion of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: IDL conducted negotiated rulemaking to promulgate temporary rules pertaining to permanent closure of cyanidation facilities and permanent closure performance bond requirements to implement the provisions of Senate Bill 1169, which amended Idaho Code Title 47, Chapter 15. The amendm ents contained in SB 1169 require IDL to review and approve permanent closure plans for cyanidation facilities, and to establish permanent closure bond requirements. SB 1169 directed IDL and the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to promulgate temporary rules by August 1, 2005. To ensure consistency among IDL's and DEQ's rules regarding permanent closure requirements, IDL conducted the negotiated rulema king in coordination with DEQ. In conjunction with members of the regulated community and other interested parties, IDL initiated negotiated rulemaking to establish temporary/proposed rules pertaining to permanent closure of cyanidation facilities and performance bond requirements for permanent closure plans. Issues addressed in the temporary rules include, but are not limited to, definitions pertaining to the operation and permanent closure of cyanidation facilities, application and performance bond requirements for permanent closure of cyanidation facilities, requirements for permanent closure cost estimates, application fees, and provisions for approving or rejecting an application. The State Board of Land Commissioners adopted the temporary rule at its regular meeting on July 12, 2005. Issues addressed in the proposed rule will include the negotiated temporary rule text and other amendments to IDL's \"Rules Governing Exploration and Surface Mining in Idaho.\" The latter include, but are not limited to, correction of internal citation cross-references; clarification and/or simplification of language in the current rule; deletion of redundant text; deletion of statutory language from the rules and replacing it with appropriate citations to Idaho Code; and other miscellaneous technical corrections. In addition to the negotiated temporary rule, substantive changes to IDAPA 20.03.02 include, provisions that will allow operators of cyanidation facilities to apply to file permanent closure bonds in phases that coincide with phased construction, operation, and closure of cyanidation facilities; inclusion of requirements for nonpoint source control and best management practices to prot ect groundwater, as well as surface wate r, from nonpoint source sediment or other pollutants that may enter surface or ground waters from mining operations; and a provision allowing the director to request a geotechnical analysis and report for pit walls if there is a potential for the wall to fail, regardless of height. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language IDL proposes to add is underlined. Language IDL proposes the delete is struck out. Public comment should be addressed to these additions and deletions. After consideration of public comments, IDL intends to present the final proposal to the Land Board for adoption of a DEPARTMENT OF LANDS Docket No. 20-0302-0502 (Fee Rule) Rules Governing Exploration and Surface Mining in Idaho Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 378 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10pending rule in November 2005. The pending rule will become final upon the conclusion of the 2006 session of the Idaho Legislature if approved by the Legislature. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fees being imposed by these rules. Amendments to Section 47-1506(g), Idaho Code, authorized the Land Board to require a reasonable fee for reviewing and approving a permanent closure plan. The fee may includ e the cost to employ a qualified independent party to verify the accuracy of the cost estimate to complete permanent closure, which will be prepared for and submitted to IDL by an operator of a cyanidation facility. IDL will seek assistance from the DEQ and/or qualified consultants to provide the specialized technical expertise necessary for pe rmanent closure plan review. These consultations will be necessary to ensure that appropriate measures are in place, prior to approval of a permanent closure plan, to protect public health, safety, and welfare. The proposed rule will require an operator of a cyanidation facility to pay an application processing and review fee and a permanent closure cost estimate verification fee. The minimum amount of the processing and review fee will be $5,000 or, upon agreement between IDL and an operator, a sum equal to IDL's estimated reasonable costs to review a permanent closure application if IDL estimates the cost will be more than $5,000. The permanent closure cost estimate verification fee will be a sum equal to the reasonable estimated costs for a qualified independent party to review a permanent closure cost estimate. The application fees apply only to appl ications for permanent closure of cyanid ation facilities; operators engaged in surface mining operations are not re quired to pay an application fee. FISCAL IMPACT: No negative impact occurs from this rulemaking; this provision is not applicable. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: The text of the proposed rules pertaini ng to permanent closure of cyanidation facilities was drafted based on discussions held and concerns raised during a negotiation conducted pursuant to Section 67-5220, Idaho Code and IDAPA 04.11.01.812-815. The scope of rule negotiations included application requirements for permanent closure of cyanidation facilities, the application fee, procedures for application processing and review, permanent closure requirements, and bonding provisions. Subsequent discussions were held to address concerns regarding the proposed amendments to the reclamation rules for e xploration and surface mining operations, and to refine or clarify certain provisions in the negotiated temporary rules. The Notice of Intent to Promulgate Rules-Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, April 6, 2005, Volume 05-4, Page 16.

(11-1-89) ii. For purposes of this rule, ground cover shall be considered comparable if it has, on the area actually planted at least seventy percent (70%) of the premining ground cover for the mined area or adjacent reference area; (11-1-89) iii. For locations with an average annual precipitation of more than twenty-six (26) inches, the director, in approving a reclamation or permanent closure plan, may set a minimum standard for success of revegetation as follows: Vegetative cover of seventy percent (70%) for two (2) full growing seasons in areas planted to herbaceous species only; or fifty percent (50%) vegetative cover for two (2) full growing seasons and six hundred (600) woody plants per acre in areas planted to a mixture of herbaceous and woody species. (11-1-89) ( ) iv. As used in this grasses, legumes, and other forbs; shrubs, trees, and vines; and \"groun d cover\" means the area of the ground surface covered by the combined aerial parts of vegetation and the litter that is produced naturally on-site, expressed as a percentage of the total area measured. Rock surface areas will be excluded from this calculation. (11-1-89) v. For previously mined areas that were not reclaime d to the standards required by Section 140, and which are affected by the surface mining or cyanidation facility operations, vegetation should be established to the extent necessary to control erosion, but shall not be le ss than that which existed before redisturbance; and (11-1-89) ( ) vi. Vegetative cover shall not be less than that required to control erosion. (11-1-89) c.Introduced species may be planted if they are known to be comparable to previous vegetation, or if known to be of equal or superior use for the approved post-mining use of the affected land, or, if necessary, to achieve a quick, temporary cover for soil stabilization purposes. Species classified as poisonous or noxious weed species shall not be used in revegetation. (11-1-89) d.By mutual agreement of the director, the landowner, and the operator, a site may be converted to a DEPARTMENT OF LANDS Docket No. 20-0302-0502 (Fee Rule) Rules Governing Exploration and Surface Mining in Idaho Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 417 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10different, more desirable , or more economically suitable habitat.

Trees shall be established for two (2) full growing seasons after cessation of any soil amendments and irrigation before they are consid ered to be established; and (11-1-89) iii. Forestlands undergoing revegetation with trees should be protected from erosion by vegetation, chemical binders, or other acceptable mean s during seedling establishment. (11-1-89) h.Revegetation is not required on the following areas: (11-1-89) i. Affected lands, or portions ther eof, where planting is not practicab le or reasonable because the soil is composed of excessive amounts of sand, gravel, shale, ston e, or other material to such an extent to prohibit plant growth; (11-1-89) ii. Any mined area or overburden stock piles proposed to be used in the mining operations for haulage roads, so long as those roads are not abandoned; (11-1-89) ( ) iii.

PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than October 19, 2005. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explana tion of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Certain portions of this rulemaking pertain to implementation of fee rules, most of which are closely tied to the expected activation of a new reservation system for IDPR. In response to a legislative request to eliminate a park and facility access fee, we have reevaluated our fee structure an d are recommending implementation of adjusted fees for use of our campgrounds and facilities. These new fees will have a positive impact on various dedicated funds, which in turn is expected to generally offset a projected shor tfall based on the adjustment requested by the Legislature. Additionally, several rule clarifications are included that are needed to help better define operational provisions at IDPR parks and facilities. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: site type multiplied by 2; Extra Vehicle Charge, $7.00; Camping Cabins, $150.00; 26.01.20.250.02 - Reservation service fees, $10.00. These fee adjustments are auth orized in accordance with Sec. 67-4223(a), Idaho Code. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any negative fis cal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because it was determined there was insu fficient time from the formal approval of the proposed rules by the Idaho Park and Recreation Board. Public meetings will be scheduled prior to the upcoming legislative session.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a non-technical explana tion of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The Commission's Safety and Accident Reporting Rules currently adopt by incorporation several national safety codes. In particular, Rule 201 adopts the federal safety regulations applicable to natural gas utilities and pipelines. This year the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Ad ministration (PHMSA) made two changes to the federal pipeline safety regulations found at 49 C.F.R. Parts 192 and 195. Both changes implement portions of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. First, PHMSA promulgated new requirements for individuals who perform certain safety-related tasks on pipelines. In particular, the new requirements address personnel training, notice of training program changes, government review and verification of such programs, and use of on-the-job training as a qualification method. Second, PHMSA amended its safety regulations to require pipelines to develop and implement public awareness programs to promote pipeline safety. The Commission proposes to adopt these amended federal safety regulations by incorporation. FEE SUMMARY: There are no fees associated with this proposed rulemaking. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because the proposed rule adopts federal safety regulations dealing with pipeline safety .

The action is authorized pursuant to Section(s) 61-302, 61-303, 61-307, 61-503, 61-507, and 61-515, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: A public hearing concerning this proposed rule will be held on: Wednesday, October 19, 2005 at 7 p.m. Commission's Hearing Room 472 W. Washington Street, Boise, Idaho (208) 334-0300 The hearing site will be accessible to persons with disa bilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the h earing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a non-technical explana tion of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: In July 2004 the Idaho Community Action Network (ICAN) filed a Petition for Rulemaking recommending that the Commission adopt six (6) proposed changes to its Utility Customer Relations Rules and adopt one (1) new rule. In response to ICAN's Petition, the Commission initiated a negotiated rulemaking. The Commission Staff conducted public workshops in Boise and in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, to discuss ICAN's proposed changes. Parties participating in the negotiated rulemaking included ICAN, Idaho Power Comp any, PacifiCorp, Avista Utilities, Intermountain Gas, the Community Action Partnership Association of Idaho (C APAI), the Idaho Office for Refugees, Idaho Legal Aid, the North Idaho Community Action Agency, and the Commission Staff. The workshops and subsequent conversations among the parties did not result in consensus. After reviewing the ICAN proposals, the existing rules and the workshop discussions, the Commission now proposes several changes to the Utility Customer Relations Rules. First, the Commission proposes changes to Rule 305 regarding the contents of the notices that utilities are required to give customers before terminating service during the three (3) months of the winter moratorium (December, January and February). During the winter moratorium, utilities are prohibited from terminating natural gas or electric heating service for reside ntial household customers with children, elderly or infirm persons. Second, the proposed changes to Rule 306 would amend the eligibility requirements and the operation of the winter moratorium. Proposed Rule 3 06.01 would expand moratorium eligibility to include households receiving financial assistance through the Low-Income Home Ener gy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) during the current program year. Customers who participate in the winter paymen t plan (payments equal to on e-half (1/2) of the annual level pay plan) may participate in successive years of the wi nter payment plan. Eligible customers participating in the moratorium may maintain their participation if they move to another residence during the three (3) months and utilities shall be required to turn on service at the new residence. Third, existing Rule 311.01 prohibits the termination of utility services on Saturday, Sunday, a legal holiday, or after 2 p.m. on any Friday or on any day immediately preced ing any legal holiday. The Commission proposes to amend this rule by prohibiting disconnection on any day immedi ately preceding a holiday and moving the 2 p.m. threshold on Friday to 12 noon. Fourth, Rule 701 would be clarified by listing the required contents of the annual summary of rules that utilities provide to each customer. Finally, Rule 701.04 would require that the Commission provide utilities with a \"model\" of the annual summary of rules including a Spanish language model. The Commission also proposes other changes to clarify these rules. FEE SUMMARY: There are no fees associated with this proposed rulemaking.

The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 61- 515 and 61-113, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than October 19, 2005. The hearing site will be accessible to persons with disa bilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the h earing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a non-technical explana tion of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Admi nistration (PHMSA) has issued several changes to the federal regulations concerning the transportation of hazardous materials by rail. PHMSA has clarified which functions in the rail transportation chai n are subject to the federal hazardous materials regulations (HMRs) and which are not subject to HMRs. More specifically, the \"pre-trans portation function\" (the loading of packaged hazardous material on a rail car), the transportation of the car by a railroad, and \"storage incidental\" to the transportation (storage between the time the railroad takes physical possess ion of the car containing hazardous materials and when the car is delivered to its destination), are all subject to the federal HMRs. Delivery of a rail car carrying hazardous material to tracks that are used solely by the receiving customer (e.g., private tr ack or private siding) is not subject to the HMRs. The HMRs do not apply to rail movements solely within a contiguous facility where public access is restricted, or to the unloading of a hazardous material car after the railroad has deliver ed the car to the customer. PHMSA also adopted changes that align the HMRs with the International Atomic Energy Agency requirements regarding the rail transportation of Low Specific Activity (LSA) materials. Finally, PHMSA added a definition of \"person who offers or [the] offeror\" to the HMRs. The Co mmission proposes to adopt these new amendments to the federal HMRs by incorporation. FEE SUMMARY: There are no fees associated with this proposed rulemaking. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because the proposed rule merely adopts existing federal safety regulations applicable to shippers and transporters of hazardous materials by rail .

An S corporation or a partnership that incurs a loss is not entitled to claim a net operating loss deduction. The loss is passed through to the shareholders and partners who may deduct the loss. (7-1-99) 03. Income Not Taxable By Idaho . As provided in Section 63-3022(f), Idaho Code, subtract the amount of income that is exempt from Idaho income tax, if included in taxable income. Income exempt from taxation by Idaho includes the following: (7-1-99) a.Interest income from obligations issued by the United States Government. Gain recognized from the sale of United States Government obligations is not exem pt from Idaho tax and, therefore, may not be subtracted from taxable income. For the interest expense offset, see Rule 115 of these rules. (7-1-99) b.Idaho lottery prizes exempt by Section 67-7439, Idaho Code. For prizes awarded on lottery tickets purchased in Idaho after January 1, 1998, a subtraction is a llowed for each lottery prize that is less than six hundred STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-0501 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 578 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10dollars ($600). If a prize equals or exceeds six hundred dollars ($600), no subtraction is allowed. The full amount of the prize is included in income. (4-5-00) 04. Donated Technological Equipment . As provided by Section 63-3022J, Idaho Code, and Rule 180 of these rules, subtract the fair market value of technological equipment donated to qualifying institutions. (4-5-00) 05. Long-Term Care Insurance . As provided in Section 63-3022Q, Idaho Code, a deduction from taxable income is allowed for the amount of the premiums paid during the taxable year for qualifying long-term care insurance for the benefit of the taxpayer, a dependent of the taxpayer or an employee of th e taxpayer to the extent the premiums have not otherwise been deducted or accounted for by the taxpayer for Idaho income tax purposes. For taxable years beginning between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2003, the deduction was allowed for fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the premiums paid during the taxable year. (4-6-05) 06. Special First-Year Depreciation Allowance . As provided by Section 63-3022O, Idaho Code, if a taxpayer claims the special first-year depreciation allowance on property pursuant to Section 168(k), Internal Revenue Code, the adjusted basis of that property and the depreciation deduction allowed for Idaho income tax purposes shall be computed without regard to the special first-year depreciation allowance. (3-20-04) a.Depreciation. Subtract the amount of depreciatio n computed for Idaho income tax purposes that exceeds the amount of depreciation computed for federal income tax purposes. (3-20-04) b.Gains and losses. During the recovery period, the adjusted basis of depreci able property computed for federal income tax purposes will be less than the adju sted basis for Idaho income tax purposes as a result of claiming the special first-year depreci ation allowance. If a loss qualifies as a capital loss for federal income tax purposes, the federal capital loss limitations and carryback and carryover provisions shall apply in computing the Idaho capital loss allowed. (3-20-04) i. If a sale or exchange of property results in a gain for both federal and Idaho income tax purposes, subtract the difference between the federal and Idaho gain s computed prior to any ap plicable Idaho capital gains deduction. (3-20-04) ii. If a sale or exchange of property results in a gain for federal income tax purposes and an ordinary loss for Idaho income tax purposes, subtract the federal ga in and the Idaho loss. For example, if a taxpayer has a federal gain of five thousand dollars ($5,000) and an Id aho loss of four thousand dollars ($4,000), the amount subtracted would be nine thousand dollars ($9,000). (3-20-04) iii. If a sale or exchange of property results in an ordinary loss for both federal and Idaho income tax purposes, subtract the difference between the federal and Idaho losses. For example, if a taxpayer has a federal loss of three hundred dollars ($300) and an Idaho loss of five hundred dollars ($500), the amount subtracted would be two hundred dollars ($200). (3-20-04) iv. If a sale or exchange of property results in a capital loss for both federal and Idaho income tax purposes, apply the capital loss limitations and subtract the difference between the federal and Idaho deductible capital losses. For example, if a taxpayer has a federal capital loss of six thousand dollars ($6,000) and an Idaho capital loss of eight thousand dollars ($8,000), both the federal and Idaho capital losses are limited to a deductible capital loss of three thousand dollars ($3,000). In this case, no subtraction is required for the year of the sale. In the next year, assume the taxpayer had a capital gain for both federal and Idaho purposes of two thousand dollars ($2,000). The capital loss carryovers added to the capital gain results in a federal deductible capital loss of one thousand dollars ($1,000) and an Idaho deductible capital loss of three thousand dollars ($3,000). The taxpayer would subtract the difference between the federal and Idaho deductib le losses or two thousand dollars ($2,000) in computing Idaho taxable income. (3-20-04) 07. Income Restored Under Federal Claim of Right . As provided by Section 63-3022F, Idaho Code, if a taxpayer included an item in Ida ho taxable income in a prior taxable year and was later required to restore the item because it was established after the close of the prior taxa ble year that the taxpayer di d not have an unrestricted right to such item or to a portion of the item, such taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction in determining Idaho taxable income if the taxpayer has not otherwise deducted such item in computing his taxable income. The deduction shall be STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-0501 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 579 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10allowed to the extent such deduction wo uld have been allowed to the taxpayer under Section 1341, Internal Revenue Code, had the taxpayer claimed the deduction instead of the recalculation of federal tax, but only to the extent the item was included in Idaho taxable income in the prior taxable year.

As provided in Section 63-3022(f), Idaho Code, subtract the amount of income that is exempt from Idaho income tax if included in taxabl e income. Income exempt from taxation by Idaho includes the following: (7-1-99) a.Certain income earned by American Indian s. See Rule 033 of these rules. (5-3-03) b.Retirement payments received pursuant to the ol d Teachers' Retirement Syst em. Prior to its repeal on July 1, 1967, the old Teachers' Retirement System was codified at Title 33, Chapter 13, Idaho Code. Teachers who were employed by the state of Idaho and who retired on or after January 1, 1966, generally do not qualify for this exemption. Teachers who were not state employees and who retired on or after January 1, 1968, do not qualify. Teachers receiving benefits pursuant to the Public Empl oyees' Retirement System, Title 59, Chapter 13, Idaho Code, do not qualify for the exemption. No ex emption is provided for amounts receive d from other states, school districts outside Idaho, or any other source if the proceeds do not relate to teaching performed in Idaho. (3-20-97) 02. Military Compensation for Service Performed Outside Idaho .

See Rule 032 of these rules. (3-30-01) 03. Standard or Itemized Deduction . As provided in Section 63-3022(j), Idaho Code, deduct either the standard deduction amount as defined in Section 63, Internal Revenue Code, or the itemized deductions allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. If itemized deductions are lim ited pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, they are also limited for Idaho income tax purposes. (3-30-01) a.If state and local income or general sales taxes are included in itemized deductions for federal purposes pursuant to Section 164, Internal Revenue Code , they shall be added to taxable income. If itemized deductions are limited pursuant to Section 68, Internal Re venue Code, the amount of state and local income or general sales taxes added back shall be computed by dividing the amount of limited itemized deductions by total itemized deductions before the limitation. This percent shal l be rounded to the nearest whole percent. For example, sixty-six and one-half percent (66.5%) shall be rounded to sixty-seven percent (67%). Sixty-six and four-tenths percent (66.4%) shall be rounded to sixty-six percent (66%). This percent is then applied to state and local income or general sales taxes to determine the Idaho state and local income and general sales tax addback. See Rule 105 of these rules. (3-15-02) ( ) b.If an itemized deduction allowable for federal in come tax purposes is reduced for the mortgage interest credit or the foreign tax credit, the amount that would have been allowed if the federal credit had not been claimed is allowed as an itemized deduction.

Railroad unemployment; Worker's in Section 63- 3022(m), Idaho Code, self-employed individuals may subtract from taxable income the premiums paid to secure worker's compensation insurance for coverage in Idaho if the premiums have not been previously deducted in computing taxable income. The term worker's compensation insurance means \"workmen's compensation\" as defined in Section 41-506(d), Idaho Code. Premiums paid to s ecure worker's compensation insurance coverage are those payments made in compliance with Section 72-301, Idaho Code. (3-30-01) 06. Retirement Benefits .

See Rule 193 of these rules. (5-3-03) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 170. IDAHO CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION -- IN GENERAL (RULE 170). Section 63-3022H, Idaho Code. (3-20-97) 01. Qualifying for the Idaho Capital Gains Deduction . To qualify for the Idaho capital gains deduction, a taxpayer must report capital gain net income, as defined in Section 1222(9), Internal Revenue Code, on his federal income tax return. ( ) 02.Capital Gain Net Income Limitation . ( ) a.The Idaho capital gains deduction may not exceed the capital gain net income included in taxable income. ( ) b.Example. A taxpayer recognizes a capital gain of five thousand dollars ($5,000) on the sale of Idaho real property that qualifies for the deduction. The ta xpayer also recognizes a capital loss of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) from the sale of shares of stock. These are the only sales during the taxable year. Sixty percent (60%) of the capital gain net income from qualif ied property is greater than the capital gain net income included in the taxpayer's taxable income. Therefore, the taxpayer's Idaho capital gains deduction is limited to the capital gain net income included in taxable income of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), not sixty percent (60%) of the capital gain net income from the qualified property. For taxable year 2001 only, the capital gains deduction is eighty percent (80%) of the capital gain net income from qualified property, limited to the capital gain net income included in taxable income. ( ) 03.Ordinary Income Limitation . The Idaho capital gains deduction may not include any gains treated as ordinary income pursuant to the Internal Revenu e Code. For example, any gain from the sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of certain depreciable property treat ed as ordinary income pursuant to Section 1245, Internal Revenue Code, may not be included when computing the Idaho capital gains deduction. ( ) 014. Losses From Nonqualified Property . Losses from property not qualifying for the Idaho capital gains deduction may not be netted against gains from proper ty qualifying for the Idaho capital gains deduction before the amount of the deduction is determined. However, the Idaho capital gains de duction may not exceed the capital gain net income included in Idaho taxable income. See Subsection 170.04 for an explanation of the capital gain net income limitation. (3-15-02) ( ) 025. Losses From Qualified Property . (7-1-99) a.Losses from property qualifying for the Idaho capital gains deduction shall be netted against gains from property qualifying for the Idaho capital gains deduction before the amount of the deduction is determined. (7-1-99) b.A capital loss carryover from property qualifying for the Idaho capital gains deduction shall be netted against current year gains from property qualifying for the Idaho capital gains deduction before the amount of the deduction is determined. If a taxpayer has a capital loss carryover consisting of qualified and nonqualified property, the qualified capital loss carryover shall be the proportion that the qualified capital loss bears to the total capital loss shown on the return in the prior year multiplied by the capital loss carryover. (7-1-99) 03 6. Examples . (3-20-97)STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-0501 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 582 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10a.A taxpayer sells two (2) parcels of Idaho real prop erty that qualify for the deduction. These are the only sales during the taxable year. A capital gain of seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) is recognized on the sale of Parcel A. A capital loss of five thousand dollars ($5,000) is recognized on the sale of Parcel B. Since both parcels are qualified property, the gain and loss are netted, resulting in capital gain net income from qualified property of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500). For taxable year 2001 only, the capital gains deduction is eighty percent (80%) of the capital gain net income from qualified property, or two thousand dollars ($2,000). After 2001, the capital gains deduction returns to sixty percent (60%) or one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500). (5-3-03) b.A taxpayer recognizes a capital gain of twenty thous and dollars ($20,000) on the sale of Idaho real property that qualifies for the deductio n. The taxpayer also recognizes a capital loss of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) from the sale of shares of stock that he has held for more than one (1) year. These are the only sales during the taxable year. In this case, si nce the long-term capital loss is not from qualified property, the loss on the sale of stock does not reduce the gain from qualified property for purposes of computing the deduction. The entire gain from qualified property of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) is eligible for the Idaho capital gains deduction. For taxable year 2001 only, the capital gains deduction is eighty percent (80%) of the capital gain net income from qualified property, or sixteen thousand dollars ($16,000). After 2001, the capital gains deduction returns to sixty percent (60%) or twelve thousand dollars ($12,000). (5-3-03) 04. Capital Gain Net Income Limitation . (3-15-02) a.The Idaho capital gains deduction is allowed only if the taxpayer reports capital gain net income, as defined in Section 1222(9), Internal Revenue Code, on his federal income tax return. In addition, the Idaho capital gains deduction may not exceed the capital gai n net income included in taxable income. (3-15-02) b.Example.

The taxpayer also recognizes a capital loss of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) from the sale of shares of stock. These are the only sales during the taxable year. Sixty percent (60%) of the capital gain net income from qualified property is greater than the capital gain net income included in the taxpayer's taxable income. Therefore, the taxpayer's Idaho capital gains deduction is limited to the capital gain net income included in taxable income of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), not sixty percent (60%) of the capital gain net income from the qualified property. For taxable year 2001 only, the capital gains deduction is eighty percent (80%) of the capital gain net income from qualified property. This deduction is also limited to the capital gain net income included in Idaho taxable income. (5-3-03) 05.Ordinary Income Limitation . The Idaho capital gains deduction may not include any gains treated as ordinary income pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code.

Gross income from intangible property generally is sourced to the state of the owner's domicile. The re following are three (3) exceptions to this rule. (7-1-99)( ) a.If the intangible property is employed in the owner's trade, business or profession carried on within Idaho, any income derived from or related to the property, including gains from the sale thereof, constitutes income from Idaho sources. For example, if a nonresident pledges stocks, bonds or other intangible personal property as security for the payment of indebtedness incurred in connection with the nonresident's Idaho business operations, the intangible property has an Idaho situs and the income derived therefrom constitutes Idaho source income.

(7-1-99) c.Interest income paid by an S corporation to a shar eholder or by a partnership to a partner is sourced to Idaho in proportion to the Idaho apportionment factor of the partnership or S corporation. (7-1-99) d.Gains or losses from the sale or other disposition of a partnership interest or stock in an S corporation are sourced to Idaho by using the Idaho apportionment factor for the entity for the taxable year immediately preceding the year of the sale of the interest or stock. ( ) 02. Interest Income Earned on a Bank Account . (7-1-99) a.Personal Bank Accounts. Interest income earned on a personal bank account is sourced to the owner's state of domicile. A personal bank account is an account that is not used in connection with a business. (7-1-99) b.Business Bank Accounts. If the business is a sole proprietorship, see Rule 265 of these rules. If the business is an S corporation or partnership, see Rule 263 of these rules. (7-1-99) 03. Covenant Not to Compete . Income from a covenant not to compete is sourced to the owner's state of domicile unless the covenant was employed in the owner' s business, trade, profession or occupation conducted or carried on in Idaho as described in Subsection Paragraph 266.01.a. of this rule. (7-1-99)( ) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 340. PRINCIPLES FOR DETERMINING THE EXISTENCE OF A UNITARY BUSINESS -- UNITARY BUSINESS PRINCIPLE (RULE 340). Section 63-3027, Idaho Code. (4-6-05) 01. The Concept of a Unitary Business . (4-6-05) a.A unitary business is a single economic enterprise th at is made up either of separate parts of a single business entity or of a commonly controlled group of business entities that are sufficiently interdependent, integrated and interrelated through their activities so as to provide a synergy and mutual benefit that produces a sharing or exchange of value among them and a significant flow of value to the separate parts. This flow of value to a business entity located in Idaho that comes from being part of a unitary business conducted both within and without Idaho is what provides the constitutional due process \"definite link and minimum connection\" necessary for Idaho to apportion business income of the unitary business, even if that income arises in part from activities conducted outside Idaho. The business income of the unitary business is then apportioned to Idaho using an apportionment percentage provided by Section 63-3027, Idaho Code. (4-6-05) b.This sharing or exchange of value may also be de scribed as requiring that the operation of one (1) part of the business be dependent upon, or contribute to, the operation of another part of the business. Phrased in the disjunctive, the foregoing means that if the activities of one (1) business either contribute s to the activities of another business or are dependent upon the activities of another business, those businesses are part of a unitary business. (4-6-05)( ) 02. Constitutional Requirement for a Unitary Business . (4-6-05) a.The sharing or exchange of value described in Subsection 340.01 of this rule that defines the scope of a unitary business requires more than the mere flow of funds arising out of a passive investment or from the financial strength contributed by a distinct business undertaking that has no operational relationship to the unitary business. (4-6-05)STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-0501 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 584 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10b.In Idaho, the unitary business principle shall be applied to the fullest extent allowed by the U.S. Constitution. The unitary business principle shall not be applied to result in the combination of business activities or entities under circumstances where, if it were adverse to the taxpayer, the combination of such activities or entities would not be allowed by the U.S. Constitution. (4-6-05) 03. Separate Trades or Businesses Conducted Within a Single Entity . A single entity may have more than one (1) unitary business. In such cases it is n ecessary to determine the business, or apportionable, income attributable to each separate unitary business as well as its nonbusiness inco me, which is specifically allocated. The business income of each unitary business is then apportioned by a formula that takes into consideration the in-state and the out-of-state factors that relate to the respective un itary business whose income is being apportioned. (4-6-05) 04. Unitary Business Unaffected by Formal Business Organization . A unitary business may exist within a single business entity or among a commonly controlled group of business entities. The relationship shall be determined by reference to the relationship that exists between all related and affiliated corporations, not just those corporations whose income and apportionment factors are re quired to be considered. Fo r example, the relationship with foreign affiliates shall be considered even though a water's edge election is made. A related corporation may include insurance companies and fifty percent (50%) or less owned corporations. The scope of what is included in a commonly controlled group of business entities is set forth in Rule 344 of these rules. (4-6-05) 341. PRINCIPLES FOR DETERMINING THE EXISTENCE OF A UNITARY BUSINESS -- DETERMINATION OF A UNITARY BUSINESS (RULE 341). Section 63-3027, Idaho Code. ( ) 01. In General . Unity can be established under any one (1) of the judicially acceptable tests (Butler Brothers, Edison California Stores, Container, etc.), and can not be denied merely because another of those tests does not simultaneously apply. ( ) 02.Significant Flows of Value . A unitary business is characteri zed by significant flows of value evidenced by factors such as those described in Mobil Oil Corp. v. Vermont, 445 U.S. 425 (1980): functional integration, centralization of manageme nt, and economies of scale. These f actors provide evidence of whether the business activities operate as an integrated whole or exhib it substantial mutual interdependence. Facts suggesting the presence of the factors mentioned above should be analyzed in combination for their cu mulative effect and not in isolation. A particular business operation may be suggestive of one (1) or more of the factors mentioned above. (4-6-05)( ) 342. PRINCIPLES FOR DETERMINING THE EXISTENCE OF A UNITARY BUSINESS -- DESCRIPTION AND ILLUSTRATION OF FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATION, CENTRALIZATION OF MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE (RULE 342). Section 63-3027, Idaho Code. (4-6-05) 01. Functional Integration . Functional integration refers to transfers between, or pooling among, business activities that significantly affect the operation of the business activities. Functional integration includes, but is not limited to, transfers or pooling with respect to the unitary business's products or services, technical information, marketing information, distribution systems, purchasing, and intangibles such as patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how, formulas, and processes. There is no specific type of functional integration that must be present. The following is a list of examples of bu siness operations that can support the finding of functional integration. The order of the list does not establish a hierarchy of importance. (4-6-05) a.Sales, exchanges, or transfers (collectively \"sales \") of products, services, or intangibles between business activities provide evidence of functional integration. The significance of the intercompany sales to the finding of functional integration will be affected by the character of what is sold and the percentage of total sales or purchases represented by the intercompany sales. For example, sales among business entities that are part of a vertically integrated unitary business are indicative of functional integration. Functional integration is not negated by the use of a readily determinable market price to effect the intercompany sale s, because such sales can represent an assured market for the seller or an assured source of supply for the purchaser. (4-6-05)STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-0501 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 585 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10b.Common Marketing. The sharing of common marketing features among business entities is an indication of functional integration when such marketing results in significant mutual advantage. Common marketing exists when a substantial portion of the business entities' products, services, or intangibles are distributed or sold to a common customer, when the business entities use a common trade name or other common identification, or when the business entities seek to identify themselves to their cu stomers as a member of the same enterprise. The use of a common advertising agency or a commonly owned or controlled in-house advertising office does not by itself establish common marketing that is suggestive of functional integration. (Such activity, however, is relevant to determining the existence of economies of scal e and centralization of management.) (4-6-05) c.Transfer or Pooling of Technical Information or Intellectual Property. Transfers or pooling of technical information or intellectual pr operty, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, trade secrets, processes or formulas, know-how, research, or deve lopment, provide evidence of functional integration when the matter transferred is significant to the businesses' operations. (4-6-05) d.Common Distribution System. Use of a common distribution system by the business entities, under which inventory control and accounting, storage, traffick ing, or transportation are controlled through a common network provides evidence of functional integration. (4-6-05) e.Common Purchasing. Common purchasing of substantial quantities of products, services, or intangibles from the same source by the business entities, particularly where the purchasing results in significant cost savings or where products, services, or intangibles are not readily available from other sources and are significant to each entity's operations or sales, provides evidence of functional integration. (4-6-05) f.Common or Intercompany Financing. Significant common or intercompany financing, including the guarantee by, or the pledging of the credit of, one (1) or more business entities for the benefit of another business entity or entities provides evidence of functional integration, if the financing activity serves an operational purpose of both borrower and lender. Lending which serves an invest ment purpose of the lender does not necessarily provide evidence of functional integration. (See Subsection 342.02 of this rule for discussion of centralization of management.) (4-6-05) 02. Centralization of Management . Centralization of management exists when directors, officers, or other management employees jointly participate in the management decisions that affect the respective business activities and that may also operate to the benefit of the entire economic enterprise. Centralization of management can exist whether the centralization is effected from a parent entity to a subsidiary entity, from a subsidiary entity to a parent entity, from one (1) subsidiary entity to another, from one (1) division within a single business entity to another division within a business entity, or from any combination of the foregoing. Centralization of management may exist even when day-to-day management responsibility and accountability has been decentralized, so long as the management has an ongoing operational role with respect to the business activities. An operational role can be effected through mandates, consensus building, or an over all operational strategy of the business, or any other mechanism that establishes joint management. (4-6-05) a.Facts Providing Evidence of Centralization of Management. Evidence of centralization of management is provided when common officers participate in the decisions relating to the business operations of the different segments. Centralization of management many may exist when management shares or applies knowledge and expertise among the parts of the business. Existence of common officers and directors, while relevant to a showing of centralization of management, does not alone provide evidence of centralization of management. Common officers are more likely to provide evidence of cen tralization of management than are common directors. (4-6-05)( ) b.Stewardship Distinguished. Centralized efforts to fulfill stewardship oversight are not evidence of centralization of management ,. Stewardship oversight consists of those activities that any owner would take to review the performance of or safeguard an investment. Stewardship oversight is distinguished from those activities that an owner may take to enhance value by integrating one (1) or more significant operating aspects of one (1) business activity with the other business activities of the owner. For example, implementing reporting requirements or mere approval of capital expenditures may evidence only stewardship oversight. (4-6-05) ( ) 03. Economies of Scale . Economies of scale refers to a relation among and between business activities STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-0501 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 586 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10resulting in a significant decrease in the average per unit cost of operational or administrative functions due to the increase in operational size. Economies of scale may exist fr om the inherent cost savings that arise from the presence of functional integration or centralization of management. The following are examples of business operations that can support the finding of economies of scale. The order of th e list does not establish a hierarchy of importance. (4-6-05) a.Centralized Purchasing. Centralized purchasing de signed to achieve savings due to the volume of purchases, the timing of purchases, or the interchangeability of purchased items among the parts of the business engaging in the purchasing provides ev idence of economies of scale. (4-6-05) b.Centralized Administrative Functions. The performance of traditional corporate administrative functions, such as legal services, payroll services, pension and other employee benefit administration, in common among the parts of the business may result in some degree of economies of scale. A business entity that secures savings in the performance of corporate administrative services due to its affiliation with other business entities that it would not otherwise reasonably be able to secure on its own because of its size, financial resources, or available market, provides evidence of economies of scale.

Section 63-3027(r), Idaho Code, provides for the inclusion in the numerator of the sales factor of gross receipts from transactions other than sales of tangible personal pr operty, including transactions with the United States Government. Gross receipts are attr ibuted to Idaho if the inco me producing activity that generates the receipts is performed wholly within Idaho. Also, gross receipts are a ttributed to Idaho if, with respect to a particular item of income, the income producing activity is performed within and without Idaho but the greater part of the income producing activity is performed in Idaho, based on costs of performance. (3-20-97) 02. Income Producing Activity . The term income producing activity applies to each separate item of income and means the tran sactions and activity directly engaged in by the ta xpayer in the regular course of its trade or business for the ultimate purpose of obtaining gains or profit. The activity generally does not include transactions and activities performed on behalf of a taxpayer, such as those conducted on its behalf by an independent contractor. However, income producing activity shall include transactions and activities performed on behalf of a taxpayer when the taxpayer sells its product exclusively through independen t contractors, when the inde pendent contractors can only work for the taxpayer, or when excluding the transactions and activities of the independent contractors would lead to an unreasonable result. Income producing activity includes the following: (3-20-97) ( ) a.The rendering of personal services by employees or the use of tangible and intangible property by the taxpayer in performing a service; (3-20-97) b.The sale, rental, leasing, licensing or other use of real property; (3-20-97) c.The rental, leasing, licensing or other use of tangible personal property; (3-20-97) d.The sale, licensing or other use of intangible personal property; and (3-20-97) e.The mere holding of intangible personal property is not, by itself, an income producing activity. (3-20-97) 03. Costs of Performance . Costs of performance are the dir ect costs determin ed according to generally accepted accounting principles and accepted conditions or practices of the taxpayer's trade or business. Only the direct costs paid by th e taxpayer shall be considered. (3-20-97) ( )STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-0501 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 587 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-1004. Application . In general, receipts, other than from sales of tangible personal property, in respect to a particular income producing activity are in Idaho if: (3-20-97) a.The income producing activity is performed wholly in Idaho; or (3-20-97) b.The income producing activity is performed both within and without Idaho and a greater part of the income producing activity is performed in Idaho than in any other state, based on costs of performance. (3-20-97) 05. Special Rules . The following are rules and examples for determining when receipts from the income producing activities described below are in Idaho: (3-20-97) a.Gross receipts from the sale, lease, rental or licen sing of real property are in Idaho if the real property is located in Idaho. (3-20-97) b.Gross receipts from the rental, lease or licensing of tangible personal property are in Idaho if the property is located in Idaho. The rental, lease, licensing or other use of tangible personal property in Idaho is a separate income producing activity from the rental, lease, li censing or other use of the same property while in another state. Consequently, if property is within and without Ida ho during the rental, lease or licensing period, gross receipts attributable to Idaho shall be measured by the ratio that th e time the property was present or used in Idaho bears to the total time or use of the property everywhere during the period. (3-20-97) c.Example. A taxpayer owns ten (10) bulldozers. Du ring the year, each bulldozer was in Idaho fifty (50) days. The receipts attributable to the use of each bu lldozer in Idaho are separate items of income and are determined as follows: ((ten (10) bulldozers x fifty (50) days) / (ten (10) bulldozers x three hundred sixty five (365) days)) x total receipts = receipts attributable to Idaho. (3-20-97) d.Gross receipts for the performance of personal servi ces are attributable to Idaho to the extent the services are performed in Idaho. If services relating to a single item of income are performed within and without Idaho, they are attributable to Idaho only if a greater porti on of the services were performed in Idaho, based on costs of performance. Usually if services are performed within and without Idaho, they constitute a separate income producing activity. In this case the gross receipts attributable to Idaho are measured by the ratio that the time spent in performing the services in Idaho bears to the total time spent in performing the services everywhere. Time spent in performing services includes the time spent in performing a contract or other obligation that generates the gross receipts. This computation does not include personal serv ice not directly connected with the performance of the contract or other obligation, as for example, time spent in negotiating the contract. (3-20-97) e.Example. The taxpayer, a road show, gave theatri cal performances at various location in State X and in Idaho during the tax period. All gross receipts fr om performances given in Idaho are attributed to Idaho. (3-20-97) f.Example. The taxpayer, a public opinion survey co rporation, conducted a poll in State X and in Idaho for the sum of nine thousand dollars ($9,000). The project required six hundred (600) man hours to obtain the basic data and prepare the survey report. Two hundred (200) of the six hundred (600) man hours were expended in Idaho. The receipts attributable to Idaho are three thou sand dollars ($3,000): (200 man hours/600 man hours) x $9,000. (3-20-97) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 570. SPECIAL RULES -- SALES FACTOR (RULE 570). Section 63-3027(s), Idaho Code. (3-20-97) 01. De Minimis Gross Receipts . Minimal amounts of gross receipt s arising from incidental or occasional transactions or activities may be excluded from the sales factor unless the exclusion would materially affect the amount of income apportioned to Idaho. (3-20-97)STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-0501 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 588 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-1002. Gross Receipts From Intangibles . (3-20-97) a.If the income producing activity in respect to business income from intangible personal property can be readily identified, the income is gross receipts shall be included in the denominator of the sales factor and, if the income producing activity occurs in Idaho, in the numerator of the sales factor as well. For example, usually the income producing activity can be readily identified in respect to interest income received on deferred payments on sales of tangible property, see Rule 525 of these rules, and income from the sale, licensing or other use of intangible personal property, see Rule 550 of these rules. (3-20-97) ( ) b.If business income from intangible property cannot readily be attributed to any particular income producing activity of the taxpayer, the income cannot be assigned to the numerator of the sales factor for any state and gross receipts shall be excluded from the denominator and numerator of the sales factor. For example, if business income in the form of dividends received on stock, royalti es received on patents or copyrights, and interest received on bonds, debentures or government securities results from the mere holding of the intangible personal property by the taxpayer, the dividends, royalties and interest shall be excluded from the denominator and numerator of the sales factor. (3-30-01) ( ) c.Subsection 570.02 of this rule is not intended to limit the ability of the Tax Commission to allow or require alternative apportionment when ap propriate to fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in this state. As a result, alternative apportionment may be allowed or required even if the income producing activity with respect to business income derived from intangible personal property can be readily identified. ( ) 03. Net Gains . If gains and losses on the sale of liquid a ssets are not excluded from the sales factor by other provisions of this rule, such gains or losses shall be treated as provided in Subsection 570.03 of this rule . This subsection does not provide rules relating to the treatment of other receipts produced from holding or managing such assets. If a taxpayer holds liquid assets in connection with one (1) or more treasury functions of the taxpayer, and the liquid assets produce business income when sold, exchanged or otherwise disposed, the overall net gain from those transactions for each treasury function for the tax period is included in the sales factor. For purposes of Subsection 570.03 of this rule , each treasury function shall be considered separately. (4-5-00)( ) a.For purposes of Subsection 570.03 of this rule , a liquid asset is an asset, other than functional currency or funds held in bank accounts, held to provide a re latively immediate source of funds to satisfy the liquidity needs of the trade or business. Liquid assets include foreign currency, and trading positions therein, other than functional currency used in the regular course of the taxpay er's trade or business; marketable instruments, including stocks, bonds, debentures, bills, notes, options, warrants, futures contracts; and mutual funds which hold such liquid assets. An instrument is considered marketable if it is tr aded in an established stock or securities market and is regularly quoted by brokers or dealers in making a market. St ock in a corporation that is unitary with the taxpayer or has a substantial business relationship with the taxpayer is not considered marketable stock. (4-5-00)( ) b.For purposes of Subsection 570.03 of this rule , a treasury function is the pooling and management of liquid assets for the purpose of satisfying the cash flow n eeds of the trade or business, such as providing liquidity for a taxpayer's business cycle, providing a reserve fo r business contingencies, and providing for business acquisitions. A taxpayer principally engaged in the trade or business of purchasing and selling instruments or other items included in the definition of liquid assets set forth herein is not performing a treasury function with respect to income so produced. (4-5-00) ( ) c.Overall net gain refers to the total net gain from all transactions incurred at each treasury function for the entire tax period, not the net gain from a specific transaction. (4-5-00) d.Examples. (4-5-00) i. A taxpayer manufactures various gift items. Because of seasonal variations, the taxpayer must keep liquid assets available for later inventory acquisitions. B ecause the taxpayer wants to obtain a return on available funds, the taxpayer acquires liquid assets, which are held and managed in State A. The net gain resulting from all gains and losses on the sale of the liquid assets for the tax year will be reflected in the denominator of the sales factor and in the numerator of State A. (4-5-00)STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-0501 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 589 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10ii. A stockbroker acts as a dealer or trader for its own account in its ordinary course of business. Some of the instruments sold are liquid assets. Subsection 570.03 of this rule does not operate to classify those sales as attributable to a treasury function. (4-5-00)( ) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 620. ATTRIBUTING INCOME OF CORPORATIONS THAT ARE MEMBERS OF PARTNERSHIPS (RULE 620).Section 63-3027, Idaho Code. (3-20-97) 01. In General . If a corporation required to file an Idaho in come tax return is a member of an operating partnership, the corporation shall report its Idaho taxable income, including its share of income from the partnership, in accordance with this rule. For purposes of this rule, the term partnership includes a joint venture. (3-20-97) 02. Transacting Business . A corporation is transacting business in Idaho if it is a partner in a partnership that is transacting business in Idaho even though the corporation has no other contact with Idaho. In this case, both the partnership and the corporation have an Idaho filing requirement. (3-20-97) 03. Multistate Partnerships . If a partnership operates in more than one state, its income shall be apportioned and allocated on the partnership return as if the partnership were a corporation. The allocation and apportionment rules of Section 63-3027, Idaho Code, and related rules apply to the partnership. (3-20-97) 04. Partnership Income as Business Income of the Partner . (3-20-97) a.Income. If the income or loss of a partnership is bu siness income or loss to a corporate partner, its share of this net business income or loss shall be apportioned together with all other net business income or loss of the corporation. Business income or loss is defined by Section 63-3027(a)(1), Idaho Code, and Rules 330 through 334 336 of these rules. (3-20-97) ( ) b.Factors. A corporate partner's share of the partnership property, payroll, and sales after intercompany eliminations, shall be included in the numerators and the denominators of the partner's property, payroll, and sales factors when computing its apportionment formula. The partner's share of the partnership's property, payroll, and sales is determined by attributing the partnership's property, payroll, and sales to the partner in the same proportion as its distributive share of partnership income if reporting net income for the taxable year or in the same proportion as its distributive share of partnership losses if reporting a net loss for the taxable year. Generally, the partnership's property, payroll, and sales includable in the corporation's factor computations is determined in accordance with Section 63-3027, Idaho Code, and related rules. To determine how the sales attribution rules of Section 63-3027(q), Idaho Code, apply to the sales factor of the corporate partner, the sales of the partnership are treated as if they were sales of the corporation. (3-30-01) 05. Partnership Income as Nonbusiness Income of Partner . (3-20-97) a.Income. If the partnership income or loss is not bu siness income to a corporate partner, the income is nonbusiness income as defined in Section 63-3027(a)(4), Idaho Code, and Rules 335 through 339 of these rules. The corporate partner shall allocate the nonbusiness income to the state in which it was ear ned. The corporate partner, on its Idaho corporation income tax return, shall specifical ly allocate to Idaho its share of the nonbusiness income attributable to Idaho. (3-20-97) b.Factors. If the partnership income or loss is nonbusiness income to the corporate partner, none of the partnership property, payroll, or sales may be included in the computation of the factors of the corporation.

Corporation A purchased the items sold during that one (1) month period for eight thousand dollars ($8,000). The company made no nontaxable or exempt sales. Corporation A should file a sales and use tax return for the month of July, computing and reporting its taxable sales as follows. Numbers correspond to line numbers on the return.STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-0501 Idaho Sales and Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 618 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10(3-20-04) b.Example 2: During the month of July, Corporation B had total Idaho sales in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000). In addition to sales through vending machines, the corporation made over-the-counter sales, all of which were taxable, in the amount of two thousand dollars ($2,000). The remaining eight thousand dollars ($8,000) constituted sales through vending machines, of which one thousand dollars ($1,000) was for items with a unit retail price of over one dollar ($1). The other seven thousand dollars ($7,000) were sales of items through vending machines with a unit retail price of fifty cents ($0.50) each. The items sold during the month for fifty cents ($0.50) each were purchased by Corporation B for five thousand dollars ($5,000). Corporation B should file a sales and use tax return for the month, computing and reporting its taxable sales as follows: Note, that if a vendor sells some items for more than one dolla r ($1) the sales tax is included in the total receipts. This amount must be divided by one (1) plus the current tax rate expressed as a decimal, to determine the receipts before sales tax. If the tax rate is six five percent ( 65%) the divisor is one and of these rules. (5-3-03) b.Money operated dispensing equipment, see Rule 095 of these rules.

(7-1-93) b.The adjustment or refund may be claimed on the sales tax return for the month in which the bad debt adjustment is made on the books and records of the taxpayer.

The following rules apply to secured credit sales: (7-1-93) a.If the collateral is not repossessed, the seller may treat a bad debt the same as an unsecured credit sale. (7-1-93) b.If the collateral is repossessed and not seasonably resold at a public or private sale, its retention is considered to satisfy the debt and no bad debt adjustment is allowed. (7-1-93) c.If the collateral is repossessed and seasonably reso ld at public or private sale, then the seller is entitled to a bad debt adjustment. However, before calculating the amount of tax that may be credited or refunded, the taxpayer must reduce the amount claimed as worthless by the amount realized from the sale of the collateral. (3-30-01) d.If merchandise is repossessed and is subsequently resold at retail, sales tax is computed on the sales price and collected and remitted the same as on other retail sales. (7-1-93) 04.

(7-1-93) a.Retailers are required to remit sales tax on an accrual basis, even though their accounting records and income tax returns may be prepared on the cash basis of accounting. (7-1-93) b.For taxpayers who keep th eir records and file income tax returns on a cash basis, a worthless account cannot be written off as a bad debt because it has not been recognized as income in the taxpayer's books. These retailers may still claim a bad debt for sales tax purposes. The claim should be made at the same time and in the same way discussed in Subsections 063.02 and 063.03 of this rule, even though the bad debt does not appear on the retailer's income tax return. (7-1-93) c.For taxpayers who are not required to file income tax returns, the claim should be made the same way discussed in Subsections 063.02 and 063.03 of this rule. (6-23-94) d.As these claims cannot be verified against the in come tax returns of these taxpayers, sufficient evidence must be attached to the sales tax return to prove that the account ha s become worthless, that the tax was remitted by the retailer, and that the retailer did not receive payment of the tax from the buyer. (7-1-93) 05. Amount of Credit Allowed . The amount of credit that can be claimed is the amount of sales tax that is uncollectible. If both nontaxable and taxable items are financed, credit may be taken only for that portion of the bad debt which represents unpaid sales tax. (7-1-93) a.Example: A retailer sells a thirty thousand dollar ($30,000) forklift for thirty-one thousand eight five hundred dollars ($31, 8500) including sales tax. The purchaser pays a five thousand dollar ($5,000) down payment and finances the balance. The purchaser later defaults and the retailer repossesses the forklift and sells it at a public auction for six thousand dollars ($6,000). At the time of repossession the purchaser owes seventeen thousand five two hundred forty-five dollars ($17, 5245) including the financed sales tax. After the sale the amount that the retailer writes off is eleven thousand five two hundred forty-five dollars ($11, 5245). The sales tax bad debt write off is six five hundred fifty-three thirty-five dollars ($ 653 535).STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-0501 Idaho Sales and Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 620 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10(3-20-04) ( ) b.Example: A car dealer makes a taxable sale of an automobile for fourteen thousand nine hundred dollars ($14,900) along with an extended warranty for five hundred dollars ($500), a documentation fee of one hundred dollars ($100), a title fee of eight dollars ($8) and credit insurance for one hundred dollars ($100). The customer pays one thousand dollars ($1,000) cash and trades in a car worth ten thousand dollars ($10,000) which is pledged as security for an earlier outstanding loan of six thousand dollars ($6,000). The customer, therefore, has to borrow enough to pay off the old loan on the trade-in. The customer defaults on the new ten thousand nine eight hundred eight fifty dollar ($10, 908850) loan after paying five hundred dollars ($500) towards the principal. The customer damages the automobile in an accident leaving the collateral worthless. The car dealer may take an adjustment for only that portion of the bad debt representing the taxable percentage of the total sales price of the car. Only five thousand dollars ($5,000) of the total fifteen thousand nine eight hundred eight fifty dollar ($15, 908850) cost was taxable.Total taxable sale 8500 payment ($5,000) Total financed $26, 8500 Payment to principal after sale ($9,255) Amount realized at public sale ($6,000) Total bad debt $11, 5245 Sales tax portion of bad debt $11,545 - (11,545 / 1.06) $11,245 - (11,245 / 1.05) =$ 653 $ 535 Sales price of vehicle $14,900 Documentation fee $100 Extended warranty $500 Credit insurance $100 Title fee $8 Trade-in ($10,000) Sales tax $ Subtotal Down payment ($1,000) 4,858 Amount financed $ 10,908 10,850 Payment to principal after sale ($500) Amount of bad debt $ 10,408 10,350STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-0501 Idaho Sales and Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 621 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10(3-20-04) ( ) 06.

Credit for bad debts for sales tax purposes may be claimed by the retailer that made the original sale and paid the sales tax to the state. Financial institutions or other third parties who are the assignees of the retailer may claim a bad debt fo r sales tax on property for which they provided financing, if the amount financed includes the sales tax remitted on the sale of the property.

The retailer will compute the tax upon the total sale to a purchaser at a given time and not upon each individual item purchased. (7-1-93) 04. Bracket System for Five Percent Tax Rate . The following schedule is to be used in determining the amount of tax to be collected by a retailer at the time of sale through April 30, 2003 beginning July 1, 2005 . (3-20-04) ( ) a.Multiply five cents ($0.05) for every whole dollar included in the sale, and (7-1-93)Amount of down payment used to pay sales tax (300 / 5,908) ($250 $250 - $42.70 =$249.20 $207.30 $10,908 $207.30 / $10.850 =2.28% 1.91% Sales principal $500 x .0228 .0191= $ 11.40 $9.55 =$237.80 $197.75STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-0501 Idaho Sales and Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 622 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10b.Add for each additional fractional dollar amount of sale the corresponding tax below: However, sales to a total amount of eleven cents ($0.11) or less are exempt from tax.

The amount of tax collected by the retailer must be displayed separately from the list price, marked price, the price adver tised in the premises or other price on the sales slip or other proof of sale. The retailer may retain any amount coll ected under the bracket system which is in excess of the amount of tax for which he is liable to the state during th e period as compensation for the work of collecting that tax. (7-1-93) 07.Unit Sales at Single Price . When transactions involve unit sales at a single price, such as admission tickets, the requirement to calculate and itemize the sales tax can be met by showing the total cost separately in a statement of the price on the ticket. (7-1-93) a.Example 1: The ticket price for admission to a high school basketball game is two dollars ($2). The separate statement of tax may be shown as:Dollar Amount of Sale Tax 0.00 - 0.05 .00 0.06 - 0.25 .01 0.26 - 0.45 .02 0.46 - 0.65 .030.66 - 0.85 .04 0.86 - 0.99 .05 Dollar Amount of Sale Tax 0.00 - 0.03 .00 0.04 - 0.20 .01 0.21 - 0.37 .020.38 - 0.53 .03 0.54 - 0.70 .04 0.71 - 0.87 .050.88 - 0.99 .06 Admission $1.88 Tax (6%) $ .12STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-0501 Idaho Sales and Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 623 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10Twelve cents ($0.12) must be set aside and held as state money arising from tax on the admission.

Reimbursement of Tax From the Purchaser to the Seller . If the seller does not collect the sales tax at the time of the sale and it is later determined that sale s tax should have been collected , the seller can then collect the sales tax from the purchaser if the delinquent tax has been paid by the seller. The legal incidence of the tax is intended to fall upon the buyer, Section 63-3619, Idaho Code. (7-1-93) a.Example: The Commission determines that certain nontaxed sales by a seller are subject to sales tax and that the seller did not collect the tax and did not have documentation supporting exemption from the sales tax. The Commission issued a Notice of Deficiency Determination to the seller imposing the tax and interest. The assessment then paid by the seller entitles the seller to reimbursement from the buyer.

If the owner fails to pay the tax timely, he must get written approval from the Tax Commission to use this option. (7-1-93) c.Equipment which remains in Idaho for more than ninety (90) days in any consecutive twelve (12) months is no longer transient. This equipment becomes subject to Idaho use tax on its fair market value at that time. No credit may be taken for use tax paid on fair market re ntals against the use tax due at the time equipment ceases to qualify as transient. (7-1-93) d.Example: A Wyoming contractor brings transient equipment, with a fair market value of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), to Idaho for use on a ninety (90) day project. The fair market rental value of the equipment for the ninety (90) days totals fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000). Idaho use tax on the fair market rental value, at the rate of six five percent ( 65%), totals nine seven hundred fifty dollars ($ 900750). The contractor paid three thousand five hundred dollars ($3,500) of sales tax to the state of Wyoming when he bought the equipment new. The contractor is not required to pay tax to Idaho since the tax paid to Wyoming exceeds the amount of Idaho use tax due. (3-20-04) ( ) e.Example: The same contractor take s a second job in Idaho within the same twelve (12) months and brings the same equipment, now with a fair market value of ninety-five thousand dollars ($95,000), to Idaho for the job. As the equipment has now exceeded the ninety (90) da y rule for transient equipment, it is subject to Idaho's six five percent ( 65%) use tax on its fair market value of ninety-five thousand dollars ($95,000) x six five percent ( 65%) = five four thousand seven hundred fifty dollars ($ 5,700 4,750). Credit of two thousand six seven hundred fifty dollars ($2,600750) is allowed for sales tax paid to Wyoming, three thousand five hundred dollars ($3,500) less the nine seven hundred fifty dollar ($ 900750) credit already used on rent als. The contractor owes three two thousand one hundred dollars ($ 3,100 2,000) of use tax to Idaho. (3-20-04) ( ) 04. Licensed Motor Vehicles . A motor vehicle licensed in a nonresident's home state and brought to Idaho to use for ninety (90) days or less in any consecutive twelve (12) months is not subject to Idaho use tax. Once the vehicle is used here more than ninety (90) days during any consecutive twelve (12) months, use tax applies to the fair market value of the vehicle at that time unless tax was paid to another state in an amount equal to, or greater than, the tax owed to Idaho. Special rules apply to new residents of Idaho. See Rule 107 of these rules. (3-20-04) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 107. VEHICLES AND VESSELS - GIFTS, MILITARY PERSONNEL, NONRESIDENT, NEW RESIDENT, TAX PAID TO ANOTHER STATE, SALES TO FAMILY MEMBERS, SALES TO AMERICAN INDIANS, AND OTHER EXEMPTIONS (RULE 107). 01. In General . This rule discusses specific topics relating to motor vehicles including gifts, military personnel, and exemptions. Refer to Rule 106 of these rule s for general information on purchases, sales, rentals, and leases of motor vehicles. (3-6-00) 02. Gifts of Motor Vehicles . When the following facts clearly esta blish that a motor vehicle is being transferred as a gift from the titleholder to another, the vehicle can be transferred tax exempt if: (7-1-93) a.No money, services, or other consideration is exchanged between the donor and recipient at any time. (7-1-93) b.The recipient assumes no indebtedness. (7-1-93)STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-0501 Idaho Sales and Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 625 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10c.The relationship of the donor and recipient indicates a basis for a gift. (7-1-93) d.The donor and recipient complete and sign a Sale s Tax Exemption Certificat e-Transfer Affidavit, Form ST-133, and submit it to the county assessor or the Idaho Transportation Department along with the title to the vehicle being transferred. If the donor is unable to sign the affidavit: (2-18-02) i. A letter stating the vehicle is a gift, and si gned by the donor, may be accepted by the county assessor or his representative and attached to the affidavit; or (2-18-02) ii. The back of the title may be marked as a gift and signed by the donor. (2-18-02)03. Nonresidents . A nonresident does not owe use tax on the use of a motor vehicle which is registered or licensed under the laws of another state or nation, is not used in Idaho more than ninety (90) days in any consecutive twelve (12) months pursuant to Section 63-3621(k), Idaho Code, and is not required to be registered or licensed under Idaho law. For purposes of this Subsection, a motor vehicle is considered to have been used in Idaho for a day when it is present in this state for more than sixteen (16) hours during any twenty-four (24) hour period. (2-18-02) 04. New Residents . A new resident of Idaho does not owe tax on the use of household goods, personal effects and privately owned motor vehicl es, if he acquired them while he resided in another state and used them primarily outside Idaho. If a vehicle owner obtained a registration or title from another state or nation of residence more than three (3) months before moving to Idaho, this is proof that the vehicle was primarily for use outside Idaho. New residents entering Idaho with a vehicle titled in a state that does not impose a general sales and use tax will be required to complete and sign a Three Month Exemption Claim Form ST-102 and submit it to the Idaho Transportation Department or county assessor when applying for a title transfer. (2-18-02) a.If the vehicle was acquired less than three (3) months before the buyer moved to Idaho, it is presumed that it was acquired for use in this state. (7-1-93) b.Exclusion from the tax applies only to motor vehicles owned by an individual. A privately owned motor vehicle is one which is owned by, and titled to, a private individual or individuals. (3-6-00) 05. Military Personnel . Military personnel receive no special exemption from the Idaho sales and use tax regarding motor vehicles or other tangible personal property. The exemptions discussed in this rule apply equally to military and nonmilitary personnel. A military person with a home of record other than Idaho is considered to be a nonresident. A military person whose home of record is Idaho is considered to be a resident of this state. Example: A military officer with a home of record in Oregon brings a vehicle purchased in Germany to Idaho upon being stationed at Mountain Home Air Force Base. During his firs t year at Mountain Home, the vehicle is present in Idaho for more than ninety (90) days. The exemption provided to nonresidents, as discussed in Subsection 107.03 of this rule, does not apply. Use tax applies to th e fair market value of the vehicle. (7-1-93) 06. Tax Paid to Another State . When sales tax has been properly imposed by another state of the United States in an amount equal to or greater than the amount due Idaho, no Idaho tax is due. (7-1-93) a.If the amount paid to the other state is less, Idaho tax is due to the extent of the difference, unless some other exemption applies. The owner must provide evidence that the tax was pa id to the other state. A registration certificate or title issued by another taxing state is sufficient evidence that tax was imposed at the other state's tax rate. (7-1-93) b.Example: A Wyoming resident buys a vehicle there for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) two (2) months before moving to Idaho. He presents his Wyoming title to an Idaho county assessor. Since he acquired the vehicle only two (2) months before entering Idaho, no exemption applies. The tax paid to Wyoming was three hundred dollars ($300) when the vehicle was purchased. Credit for this amount is allowed against the six five hundred dollars ($ 6500) tax due Idaho. The assessor will collect three two hundred dollars ($ 3200) tax. (3-20-04) ( ) c.Example: A vehicle was purchased by a Colorado resident two (2) months before moving to Idaho. STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-0501 Idaho Sales and Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 626 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10The applicant paid three percent (3%) Colorado state sales tax, one and six tenths of one percent (1.6%) city sales tax, and one and six tenths percent (1.6%) county sales tax. The total Colorado general sales tax paid was six and two tenths percent (6.2%). Since the Idaho tax rate is six five percent (65%), no tax is due Idaho because the amount of tax paid to Colorado exceeds the amount owed Idaho. (3-20-04) ( ) d.A registration certificate or title issued by another taxing state is proof that tax was paid to the other taxing state. This does not apply to states that do not ha ve a tax, such as Montana and Oregon, or when a state has exempted the motor vehicle from tax. (7-1-93) e.Example: A church buys and titles a vehicle in Utah. The Utah sales tax law exempts the purchase of the vehicle from sales tax. The church later titles the vehi cle in Idaho. Sales tax must be paid on the fair market value of the vehicle when it is titled in Idaho. (7-1-93) f.Taxes paid to another nation cannot be offset against the taxes owed to Idaho. (7-1-93) 07. Sales to Family Members . The tax does not apply to sales of motor vehicles between members of a family related within the second degree of consangu inity. The second degree of consanguinity means only the following blood or formally adopted relatives of the person making the sale: parents, children, grandparents, grandchildren, brothers, and sisters. Relatives of the s econd degree of consanguinity do not include persons who are related only by marriage. However, when the motor vehicle sold is community property, and it is sold to a person who is related within the second degree of consanguinity to either spouse, the sale is exempt from tax. (7-1-93) a.The Sales Tax Exemption Certificate-Transfer Affi davit, Form ST-133, is used to document this exemption. The seller and buyer must complete and sign Form ST-133 and submit it to the Idaho Transportation Department or county assessor along with the title to the vehicle being transferred. If the seller is unable to sign the affidavit a letter from the seller stating the sale was made to a qualified family member may be accepted by the county assessor or his representative and attached to the affidavit. (2-18-02) b.This exemption does not apply if the seller did not pay tax when he acquired the vehicle. (7-1-93) c.Example: An Oregon resident buys a vehicle and titles it in Oregon without paying sales or use tax. Later, he sells the vehicle for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) to his son who is an Idaho resident. No exemption applies, since the father did not pay a sales or use tax when he acquired the vehicle. The son is required to pay Idaho use tax on the ten thousand dollar s ($10,000) purchase price of the vehicle. (7-1-93)( ) 08. Sales to American Indians . An enrolled American Indian tribal member may buy a motor vehicle exempt from tax if the sale and delivery of the vehicle is made within the boundaries of the Indian Reservation. The Sales Tax Exemption Certificate-Transfer Affidavit, Form ST-133, is used to document this exemption. The seller and the buyer must complete and sign Sales Tax Exemption Certificate - Transfer Affidavit Form ST-133 including the name of the tribe, Tribal Identification Number and the name of the Reservation upon which the sale and delivery occurred. The affidavit is then given to the Idaho Transportation Department or county assessor along with the title to the vehicle being transferred. (2-18-02) 09. Bulk Sale Transfers .

(6-30-95) a.From July 1, 1995 to June 30, 2004, owners or operators of amusement devices were required to pay a fee of thirty-five dollars ($35) per machine in serv ice or use. The fee for perm its purchased for the year STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-0501 Idaho Sales and Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 628 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10beginning July 1, 2004, is forty-two dollars ($42). Beginning July 1, 2005, the fee for permits will be thirty-five dollars ($35). The fee will change by an amount proportional to any change in the sales tax rate. The formula to apply to calculate the permit fee is seven hundred dollars ($700) x tax rate. For a six five percent ( 65%) tax rate the amount is therefore seven hundred dollars ($700) x six five percent ( b.Upon receiving the appropriate payment, the Tax Commission will issue to the owner or operator of one or more amusement devices, a permit for each such device in service. A separate permit on each device in service is required. The permit shall be affixed n ear the currency slot of th e machine in such a manner th at it is easily visible.

(3-6-00) a.A retailer must collect tax on the sale of any goods that are specifically excluded from an exemption as a matter of law. For example, a purchaser cl aiming the production exemption provided by Section 63- 3622D, Idaho Code, may not claim an exemption on the sale of items that are sp ecifically excluded from the exemption as a matter of law, such as: (3-6-00) i. Hand tools with a unit price not in excess of one hundred dollars ($100); (3-6-00)ii. Maintenance and janitorial equipment and supplies; (3-6-00)iii. Office equipment and supplies; (3-6-00)iv. Selling and distribution equipment and supplies; (3-6-00)v. Property used in research and development; (3-6-00)STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-0501 Idaho Sales and Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 632 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10vi. Property used in transportation activities; (3-6-00) vii. Equipment or other property used to make repairs; (3-6-00) viii. Tangible personal property which becomes a component of any real property or any improvement or fixture thereto; (3-6-00) ixviii. Licensed motor vehicles. (3-6-00) b.Example: A farmer completes an ST-101 claiming a production exemption on the purchase of a fifteen dollar ($15) hammer and a case of motor oil. The retailer must collect the sales tax on the sale of the hammer, but is not liable for the collection of the sales tax on the sale of the motor oil. The retailer cannot rely on the exemption certificate wh en selling the hammer because, as a matter of law, the sale of hand tools with a unit price of one hundred dollars ($100) or less are is excluded from the production exemptio n. But the retailer can rely on the exemption certificate when selling goods, such as the motor oil, which th e farmer could put to either a nontaxable use (e.g., oil for a tractor), or a taxable use (e.g., oil for a licensed pickup truck). (3-6-00)( ) c.Additionally, when a retailer sells merchandise which qualifies for the production exemption in Section 63-3622D, Idaho Code, and which may be used for either a taxable or a nontaxable purpose, such as the sale of a battery which is taxable when used in a car and not taxable when used in a farm tractor, the retailer is relieved of the liability for and responsibility of collecting the sales tax if the purchaser provides a description on the exemption certificate of the intended nontaxable use of the item. (3-6-00) d.A retailer cannot rely on an exemption certificate obtained from a purchaser when the law does not provide an exemption from the tax for the purchaser, such as a nonprofit organization not specifically exempted by the sales tax law or a governmental agency of another state. (3-6-00) e.Nor can a retailer rely on an exem ption certificate when the limited language of the law pertaining to the exemption claimed excludes all but certain goods fr om the exemption. For exampl e, certain contractors can execute an ST-101 to purchase construction materials for specific jobs in non-taxing st ates claiming an exemption from tax under Section 63-3622B, Idaho Code, and Rule 012 of these rules. The retailer must collect tax on any goods that are not to be incorporated into the real property, such as parts for construction equipment and tools. (3-6-00) 08. Timely Acceptance of Certificates . A seller may accept a certificate from a purchaser prior to the time of sale, at the time of sale, or at any reasonable time after the sale to establish the exemption claim, with the exception of Forms ST-104-HM and ST-104G which must be provided at the time of sale. However, if no approved certificate is obtained from the purchaser in the manner provided or permitted by this rule, the sale is presumed to be taxable. (3-6-00) a.Certificates obtained by a seller at a time subsequent to but not within a reasonable time after the time of sale will be considered by the State Tax Commissi on in conjunction with all other evidence available to determine whether or not the seller has established, by clear and convincing evidence, that a sales tax transaction is exempt from tax. For the purposes of th is rule, evidence is clear and convinci ng when it shows that the truth of the facts asserted is highly probable. Evidence which indicates that it is more likely than not the fact is true is not sufficient to establish clear and convincing evidence. (3-6-00) b.Example: A retailer sells goods to a customer w ithout charging the sales tax but does not obtain an ST-101 from the customer. Instead, the customer writes his se ller's permit number on the invoice when he signs for the goods. The retailer is later audited by the State Tax Commission and fails in an attempt to obtain a certificate from his customer. The retailer argues that the seller's permit number written on the invoice is clear and convincing evidence that the customer purchased the goods for resale . However the number by itself does not establish that the customer is in a business which sells the type of goods purchased from the retailer. Even if it is more likely than not that the customer intended to resell the goods, the retailer has not established, solely by the existence of the seller's STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-0501 Idaho Sales and Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 633 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10permit number, that it is highly probable that the goods were for resale. The retailer is liable for the tax on the sale. (3-6-00) c.Example: A retailer sells a truck load of hay to a customer, does not charge sales tax on the transaction, and fails to obtain an ST-101. The retailer is later audited by the State Tax Commission and is unable to obtain an ST-101 from the cust omer. The retailer argues that hay is a farm supply and this alone should establish clear and convincing evidence that the sale is exempt. However, the customer may be in a business which does not qualify for the farming production exemption, such as racing or sh owing horses. Or, the customer may be using the hay for a nonbusiness purpose, such as raising animals for his own consumption. Although it is more likely than not that the customer is a farmer, the retailer has not provided clear a nd convincing evidence that the hay was purchased for use in a farming operation. The retailer is liable for the tax on the sale. (3-6-00) d.When a Notice of Deficiency Determination ha s been issued to a seller by the State Tax Commission and the seller petitions for redetermination as provided by Rule 121 of these rules, he may submit certificates obtained from his customers as evidence of exem ption claims, but only if the certificates are presented to the State Tax Commission within ninety (90) days of the date of the Notice of Deficiency Determination.

The National Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, enacted November 25, 2002, prohibits the states from imposing tax on any vessel or other water craft, or its passengers or crew if the vessel or water craft is operating on any navigable waters. The Tax Commission interprets this statute to mean that states are prohibited from taxing sales of raftin g trips if they occur on navigable waters. See 33 U.S.C. Section 5. If Congress repeals the preemption sales of rafting trips will become taxable on the effective date of the repeal. This interpretation is subject to judicial review and could change, depending on rulings from state or federal courts.

A change in the form of doing business qualifies for an occasional sale exemption when the ultimate ownership of the property is substantially unchanged. Example: The incorporation of a partnership qualifies for an occasional sa le exemption when substantially all of the property owned by the partnership is transferred to the corporation, and the stockholders of the corporation own substantially the same proportion of the corporation's stock as they owned in the partnership interest as partners. (7-1-93) 03. Bulk Sale - Sale of an On-Going Business .

(7-1-93) ( )STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-0503 Idaho Sales and Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 647 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10a.Example: Two (2) individuals form a partnershi p. Each contributes a car in exchange for a percentage of ownership in the business. If each partner pa id sales tax when he purcha sed his vehicle, no sales tax applies to the transfer of the vehicle into the partnership. (7-1-97) b.Example: Three (3) individuals ar e equal partners in a constructi on business. They dissolve the partnership, and each person takes one-third (1/3) of the capital assets as his share of the equity in the business. If tax was paid on the assets when they were purchased by the pa rtnership, sales tax does not apply to the transfer of the assets from the partnership to the co-owners. (7-1-93) c.Example: A corporation-owned car is given to a shareholder as a bonus for special accomplishments. There is no change in the recipient's shareholdings. The shareholder must pay tax on the bonus based on the value of the car, regardless of whether the corporation paid tax when the car was purchased. The exemption does not apply because the transfer of the car did not change the shareholder's equity. (7-1-93) 06. Sales and Rentals to Related Parties . The sale of a capital asset to a related party qualifies for the occasional sale exemption, but only if the seller has paid sa les or use tax when the asset was acquired or if the seller acquired the asset from a related party who paid sales tax on acquisition of the asset. Effective January 1, 1996, rRentals and leases of capital assets between related parties will also qualify for the occasional sale exemption, but only if the initial related party paid sales tax upon acquisition of the asset. If the initial purchaser does not pay sales or use tax upon the purchase of a capital asset and then leases the asset to a related party, the lessor must collect and remit sales tax on the lease payments. The lease payments must also represent a reasonable rental value for the asset. Exempt transactions between related parties include sales, re ntals, and leases of capital assets other than aircraft, boats and vessels, snowmobiles, off-highway motorbikes, and recreational vehicles, as defined by Section, 63- 3622HH, Idaho Code, such as the following: (7-1-97) ( ) a.Sales to family members, but only if all parties to the sale are related within the second degree of consanguinity, relationship by blood, or affinity, relationship by marriage, i.e., spouses, children, parents, brothers, sisters, or grandparents. Example: A father and son are th e stockholders of Corporation A. This corporation sells a business asset to Proprietorship B, which is owned by the son's grandfather. This sale is exempt as long as Corporation A paid sales tax when the asset was acquired. (7-1-98) b.Sales in which the new owners are identical to th e prior owners. Example: Corporation B owns one hundred percent (100%) of Corporation A. If the initial purchaser paid tax when it acquired an asset, it may sell the asset to the other without tax. Example: John Doe owns one hundred percent (100%) of a corporation. He buys a truck and pays sales tax. He later sells the truck to his corporation. No tax applies to the sale of the truck to the corporation. Example: A and B each own fifty percent (50% ) of a partnership. The partnership buys a capital asset and pays sales tax to the vendor. The partnership immediately leases the asset to Corporation C. A owns ten percent (10%) of Corporation C and B owns ninety percent (90%) of Corporation C. Since the percentages of ownership of the partnership and the corporation are not identical, the lease transaction does not qualify for the occasional sale exemption. The partnership must seek a refund of the sales tax paid on acquisition of the asset and collect and remit sales tax on the lease payments. (7-1-97) 07. Motor Vehicles . Sales of licensed motor vehicles are not considered occasional sales and are taxable, except under the provisions of Subsections 099.02 through 099.06 of this rule. If a motor vehicle transfer qualifies for an exemption under Subsections 099.02 through 099.06 of this rule, written clearance must be obtained from the State Tax Commission the purchaser must complete an appropriate exemption claim form prior to applying for an Idaho motor vehicle title. See Rule 107 of these rule s regarding sales of licensed motor vehicles that do not qualify as occasional sales and th e appropriate exemption claim form . (3-15-02) ( ) 08. Sales of Business Assets . Also excluded from the category of occasional sales, other than as provided by Subsection 099.06 of this rule, are sales of assets or other items of tangible personal property used in an activity requiring a seller's permit. Even though the item sold is not of the type normally sold by the seller in his regular course of business, the sale is subject to the tax. Example: A construction equipm ent dealership sells its office computer. Even though the seller does not normally sell computers, it must collect sales tax on the sale of the computer as the computer is used in a business requiring a seller's permit.

This exclusion applies only to building materials and fixtures that will be incorporated into real property. Sales of construction equipment such as loaders, backhoes, and excavators may still be included within the definition of \"occasional sale\" if the seller meets al l the other requirements of the exemption. ( ) a.Example. A contractor enters into a contract to fabricate and install a wrought iron gate. The contractor fabricates the gate but prior to installation the building owner decides to install the gate himself and purchases it from the contractor. The building owner's purc hase does not qualify for the occasional sale exemption. ( ) b.Example. A contractor has a backhoe that he uses in his contracting business. He sells the backhoe to another contractor. If the seller is not a retailer, as defined by statute, the sale can still qualify as an exempt STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-0503 Idaho Sales and Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 649 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10occasional sale.

USE OF RATIO STUDY IN EQUALIZATION (RULE 131). Section 63-109, Idaho Code. (5-3-03) 01.Annual Equalization Ratio Study . Each year the State Tax Commission shall conduct a ratio study to assist in the equalization of assessments of prope rty within and among the categor ies of property established in Rule 130 of these rules. The ratio study shall be co nducted in accordance with the \"Standard on Ratio Studies\" published in 1999 by the International Association of Assessing Officers referenced in Rule 006 of these rules . The annual ratio study shall test assessments as of January 1 of each year. Except when sales or appraisals must be added or deleted to improve representativeness, sales used will be those occurring within each county between October 1 of the year preceding the year for which assessments are to be tested and September 30 of the year for which assessments are to be tested. Each sale price is to be adjusted for time and compared to market value for assessment purposes for the year for which assessments are to be te sted, to compute ratios to be analyzed. The State Tax Commission may use sales from extended time periods and ma y add appraisals when data is lacking. The State Tax Commission may delete sales when necessary to improve representativeness. The study shall be completed in February following the end of the period studied. The appr opriate ratio study statistical measure of level shall be determined as follows: the median for equalization ratio studies conducted beginning October 1, 2006. (3-30-01) ( ) a.Given a sample of ten (10) or fewer observations, the mean shall be used. (3-30-01) b.Given a sample of eleven (11) or more observations, the median shall be used. (3-30-01) 02. Tested For Equalization . Categories which will be tested for equalization purposes will include the following, provided that adequate samples can be obtained: (4-5-95) a.Improved Urban Residential: Abstract Items Residential: Subcategory 1 (tracts) : Abstract Items 12, 18, 34, and 40; Subcategory 2 (subdivisions): Abstract Items (subdivisions): Abstract Item 15; (4-5-95) e.Commercial: Abstract Items 13, 16, 21, 27, 33, 35, 38, and 42. (Urban and rural categories and land and improved categories will be analyzed separately, if adequate samples are available.) (3-30-01) f.Residential Condominiums: Abstract Item 26. (3-30-01) g.Manufactured Housing Without Land: Abstract Items 46, 47 , 49, and 65. (5-3-03) h.Manufactured Housing With Land: Abstract items 46, 47, and 48 with residential land for ratio studies conducted beginning January 1, 2002 . (3-15-02) a.Categories 18 and 40 may be analyzed separately from Categories 12 and 34 if adequate samples are available. If these categories (18 and 40) are not used fo r residential property, they should not be included in the 12/34 study. (3-30-01) b.Manufactured housing sales that include land may be analyzed as an independent category or in combination with other improved residential property sales with the same land category. The manufactured housing sales with land will be analyzed as an independent category unless the State Tax Commission and county assessor STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-0503 Idaho Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 662 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10agree that analysis in combination with other improved re sidential property sales with the same land category would produce a more representative sample. (3-15-02) c.Samples for the categories listed in Subsection 131.02 of this rule may be analyzed in combinations designed to produce studies of improved residential property, unimproved residential property, commercial property, and manufactured housing. Such analysis will be conducted upon request by the county assessor, provided that the assessor provides evidence to the State Tax Commission th at the resulting combined category studies will provide results that are more representative of the categories to be equalized. (3-30-01) ( ) 04. Follow-Up Ratio Study . When annual ratio study provided in Subsections 131.01 and 131.02 of this rule , discloses that assessments in any category of property as defined in Subsections 131.02 and 131.03 of this rule in a county are out of compliance with the equalization standards of this rule, the State Tax Commission shall conduct a follow-up ratio study. The follow-up ratio stud y shall test the assessments for January 1 of the year following the year tested by the annual ratio study and shall be based on property sales occurring during the calendar year immediately preceding that date. The State Tax Commission shall notify the county assessor of the results of the follow-up ratio study. The notice shall indicate whether an y adjustments will be considered by the State Tax Commission at its next equalization meeting in August based on either the annual or any follow-up ratio study and the reason for the proposed adjustments. (3-30-01) ( ) 05. Use of Ratio Study Results . The results of the annual ratio study or any follow-up ratio study shall be one (1) source of information upon which the State Tax Commission may rely when equalizing assessments of property by category under Section 63-109, Idaho Code. When the results of any ratio study on any property category as defined in Subsections 131.02 and 131.03 of this rule show, with reasonable statistical certainty as defined in Subsection 131.08 of this rule , that the appropriate measure of level of any category studied is less than ninety percent (90%) or greater than one hundred ten percent (110%), th e assessment of property within that category may be considered not equalized. When this occurs, the State Tax Commission may, at its annual meeting commencing on the second Monday in August, order the count y auditor to adjust the value of all property in any category or subcategory included in the analysis conducted in an amount the State Tax Commission finds necessary to accomplish equalization of assessments of property. The State Tax Commi ssion may order the county auditor to adjust the value of manufactured homes with land as if the combination were a category. If categories have been combined for analysis, adjustment will not be considered for any category that does not have at least one (1) observation in the ratio study conducted for the combined categories. (3-15-02) ( ) 06. Use of Alternate Ratio Study . When the follow-up ratio study required by Subsection 131.04 of this rule does not measure the true assessment level, the State Tax Commission may consider adjustment based on the most recent annually conducted ratio study or other inform ation relevant to equalizatio n. If the State Tax Commission has reason to question the representativeness of the sample used in an annual or follow-up ratio study conducted on any category of property, the State Tax Commission may delay implementation of any order to adjust property values until two (2) successive years' ratio studies fail to produce an appropriate measure of level between ninety percent (90%) and one hundred ten percent (110%). (3-30-01) ( ) 07. Submission of Additional Information . Any party may petition the State Tax Commission to consider any information or studies relevant to equalization. The petition shall include a description of the information to be presented and the petitioner's conclusions drawn from the information. (4-5-95) 08. Reasonable Statistical Certainty . For the purposes of this section and equalization pursuant to Section 63-109, Idaho Code, \"reasonable st atistical certainty\" that any category is not equalized shall mean that the appropriate measure of level determined by the ratio study fo r the category must be provably less than ninety percent (90%) or greater than one hundred ten percent (110%) of market value for assessment purposes. Beginning with the ratio study used to test 2000 assessments, s Such a determination shall occur if: (3-30-01) ( ) a.The appropriate measure of level for the category(ies) being tested is less than ninety percent (90%) or greater than one hundred ten percent (110%) and a ninety percent (90%) two-tailed confidence interval around the appropriate measure of level fails to include ninety percent (90%) or one hundred ten percent (110%); or (3-30-01) b.The appropriate measure of level for the category(ies) being tested has been less than ninety percent (90%) or greater than one hundred ten percent (110%) as determined by the most recent previous two (2) ratio STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-0503 Idaho Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 663 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10studies on the category(ies) and an eighty percent (80% ) two-tailed confidence interval around the appropriate measure of level fails to include ninety percent (90%) or one hundred ten percent (110%).

The ratio study conducted by the State Tax Commission to comply with the requir ements of Section 63-315, Idaho Code, shall be conducted in accordance with the \"Standard on Ratio Studies\" published in 1999 by the International Association of Assessing Officers referenced in Rule 006 of these rules . The following specific procedures will be used. (3-30-01) ( ) a.Information on property sales, which meet the requirements of arm's length and market value sales, will be obtained and assembled into samples representing various categories of property and designations defined in Subsection 315.02 of this rule in each school district. Except when sales or appraisals must be added or deleted to improve representativeness, sales used will be those occurring within each school district between October 1 of the year preceding the year for which adjusted market value is to be computed and September 30 of the year for which adjusted market value is to be computed. Each sale price is to be adjusted for time and compared to market value for assessment purposes for the year for whic h adjusted market value is to be computed, to comp ute ratios to be analyzed. The State Tax Commission may use sales from extended time pe riods and may add appraisals when data is lacking. The State Tax Commission may delete sales when necessary to improve representativeness. (3-30-01) ( ) b.A ratio will be determined for each sale by dividing the market value for assessment purposes of the property by the adjusted sale price or appraised value. (7-1-98) c.A statistical analysis is to be conducted for the sales and any appraisals in each property designation defined in Subsection 315.02 of this rule in each school district and appropriate measures of central tendency, uniformity, reliability, and normality computed. (3-30-01) ( ) d.With the exception of any property designations with extended time frames or added appraisals, if fewer than five (5) sales and appraisals are available, no adjustment to the taxable value of the designation will be made. (7-1-98) e.If there are five (5) or more sales and appraisals and it is determined with reasonable statistical certainty that the property designation is not already at market value for assessment purposes, an adjusted market value will be computed for the school district by dividing the taxable value for the year for which adjusted market value is to be determined by the appropriate ratio derived from the ratio study. The appropriate ratio to be used shall be the weighted mean ratio calculated from the sample for each designation, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this statistic has been distorted by nonrepresentative ratios. In this case the median may be substituted: (3-30-01) f.Within each school district, adjusted market va lue or taxable value for each category of real, personal and operating property will be summed to produce the total adjusted market value for the school district. The school district taxable value will then be divided by this adjusted market value to produce the overall ratio of assessment in each school district. Statewide totals are to be calculated by compiling county totals. (7-1-98) g.Urban renewal increment values will not be included in the taxable value or the adjusted market value for any school district. (7-1-98) h.\"Reasonable statistical certainty,\" that the property designation in question is not at market value for assessment purposes, is required. Su ch certainty is tested using ninety percent (90%) confidence intervals about the weighted mean or median ratios. If the appropriate confidence interval includes ninety-five percent (95%) or one hundred five percent (105%), there is not \"reasonable statis tical certainty\" that the property designation is not at market value for assessment purposes.

(3-30-01) ( ) lk.\"Appraisal\" or \"appraised value\" refers to any State Tax Commission provided independently conducted property appraisal. (7-1-98) 02. Use of Property Designations . In computing the ratio for each school district, the State Tax Commission will designate property as residential, commercial, or manufactured housing and shall assign appropriate property categories defined in Rule 130 of these rules to th ese designations. For each school district, adjusted market value shall be computed by dividing the appropriate ratio as certained for each of these de signations into the sum of the taxable values for each category of pr operty assigned to a designation. For the taxable value in any category to be included in said sum, at least one (1) observation (sale or appraisal) from that category must be present in the ratio study. If the ratio for any given designation in a school distri ct indicates that the market value for assessment purposes cannot be determined with reasonable statistical certainty to differ from statutorily required market value, the taxable value shown on the school district abstract(s) required pursuant to Subsection 315.04 of this rule for each of the categories included in that designation shall be the adjusted market value for said designation for said school district. (3-30-01) ( ) 03. Assessor to Identify School Districts . Each county assessor will provide to the State Tax Commission the school district in which each sale submitted for the ratio study is located.

Rule 170: Amend Motor Fuels Rule 170 by removing \"feder al government\" because they cannot use dyed low-sulfur diesel in their motor vehicles on a highway and update who can use low-sulfur dyed diesel fuel in their motor vehicles. Rule 180: Amend Motor Fuels Rule 180 to remove the requirement for a statement in Subsection 180.02 that is not required for a licensed fuel dist ributor to receive a refund.

Rule 400: Amend Motor Fuels Rule 400 to correct a refere nce to an Idaho Code section that was renumbered in a previous year. Rule 510: Amend Motor Fuels Rule 510 to replace the word \"biodiesel\" with the phrase \"biodiesel blended fuels.\" FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any negative fis cal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/ASTATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0105-0501 Idaho Motor Fuels Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 671 October 5, 2005 - Vol. 05-10NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because the proposed changes are of a simple nature .

(4-6-05) a.The IFTA licensee must recompute the total taxable fuel for Idaho by deducting the gallons determined by the allowances in all jurisdictions from the total number of gallons of fleet fuel consumed that was reported on the IFTA return. Using the new net gallons consumed, recompute the fleet miles per gallon. Apply the new fleet miles per gallon to the reported Idaho taxable miles to calculate the corrected Idaho taxable gallons. To calculate the Idaho nontaxable gallons av ailable for refund, the licensee must su btract the recomputed taxable gallons for Idaho from the original taxable gallons reported for Idaho. This nontaxable gallon figure is then entered on the line labeled nontaxable gallons on the Form 75. (4-5-00) b.Additionally, a copy of the IFTA tax return fo r the period subject to the refund claim and a statement or worksheet showing how allowance was calculated mu st be included as an attachment to the Form 75.

This rulemaking action is authorized by Title 39, Chapters 1 and 36, Idaho Code. MEETING SCHEDULE: Those interested in participating in the negotiated rulemaking process are encouraged to attend the following meeting. Additional meetings ma y be scheduled if necessary. For information regarding additional meetings, contact Bill Jerrel at (208)373-0400 or william.jerrel@deq.idaho.gov. October 11, 2005, 9:00 a.m. Department of Environmental Quality, Conference Room D1410 N. Hilton, Boise, Idaho PRELIMINARY DRAFT: The preliminary draft rule can be obtained at http://www.deq.idaho.gov/rules/ water_pollution_control_loans/58_0112_0501_negotiated.cfm or by contacting Paula Wilson at paula.wilson@deq.idaho.gov, (208)373-0418. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: Administration of the loan program is currently paid for by a 4% set-aside from the federal capitalization grants that DEQ receives from th e U.S. Environmental Protec tion Agency (EPA). Federal capitalization grants have decreased substantially over the last few years thereby reducing the funding available from the set-aside to administer the loan program. The amount ava ilable from the set-aside each ye ar is no longer sufficient to fund DEQ's costs for the year. This creates a dilemma for DEQ because, while the EPA grant funds available for administering the State Revolving Fund (SRF) are diminishing, the amount of funds available for loans is growing due to the increasing dollar amount of loan repayments each year. The work load to issue ne w loans is increasing as the SRF funds increase. The grant funds used to administer the program are being reduced by EPA. The purpose of this rulemaking is to revise the Rules for Administration of Water Pollution Control Loans to allow DEQ to collect a fee in the fo rm of a percentage (e.g., \u00bd of 1% of the outstanding balance) of each loan. The fees collected will be used to provide funds for loan program administration. The actual interest rate charged on SRF loans will be reduced by the amount of the fee charged so that there is no cost to the communities using the SRF loans. Cities, counties, districts and associations that own and operate public wastewater treatment systems may be interested in participating in this rulemaking. DEQ intends to present the rule to the Board for temporary adoption in November 2005 with an effective date of January 4, 2006. If approved by the Board, DEQ intends to initiate proposed rulemaking by publishing the rule in the January 2006 issue of the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(a), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is necessary to protect public health. In addition, the Governor has found that the fee imposed in this rule meets the criteria set out in Section 67-5226(2), Idaho Code. Unless this fee is implemented in FY 2006, DEQ will run out of funds necessa ry to administer the SRF by the end of FY 2006 and will not be able to make loans for improvements to wastewater treatment facilities. In 2004 the Idaho Legislature added a provision for funding administration to Section 39-3626, Idaho Code; however, EPA has determined that the provision conflicts with the Clean Water Act's restrictions on fund interest earnings specified in 33 U.S.C. 1383(d)(1)(D) and the authorized types of assistance in 33 U.S.C. 1383(d)(7). Therefore DEQ cannot use interest earned on loans to fund administration of the SRF loan progra m. The agency is left with either requesting additional state general funds or adopting a loan balance fee to maintain the loan program. Imposition of the fee is authorized by Sections 39-119 and 39-3627(4), Idaho Code.

The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 59-1314(1), 33-1228, and 67-5339, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than October 19, 2005. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodations must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explana tion of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The Board has determined, based on actuarial studies and utilization data, that the current contribution rates for funding the unused sick leave account for public school empl oyees under Section 33-1228, Idaho Code, is inadequate to meet the future obligations created under that section. As a result, those contributions rates, which are expressed as a percentage of employees' salaries, are being increased. The Board has also determined that it is necessary to have multiple rates based on utilization, since some school districts grant more days of sick leave than other districts or permit more days to accrue, as currently permitted by Section 33-1218, Idaho Code , which disproportionately increases liabilities to the fund. The rate increases will be phased in over a three year period beginning July 1, 2006. Other changes have also been made to Rules 550 and 552 to avoid manipulation of hourly rates and daily rates used to calculate benefits under unused sick leave and to maintain equity in contribution rates in the event of non- traditional work weeks. Other technical changes have also made to the rules to upda te the address of the Coeur d' Alene Office in Rule 2; to correct a typographic error in Rule 6; to clarify the retirement election requirements of Rule 122 and to provide for a default election when a member fails to make one; and to change terminology in Rules 142 and 147 that more accurately describes the effect of reemployment on retirement benefits. Rule 701 has been changed to conform to a statutory change allowing inactive members to purchase service. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: None. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any negative fis cal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: N/A. These rules do raise contribution rates to the unused sick leave fund for school districts bu t those increases come from sources other than the general fund. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because it would be inconsistent with the Retirement Board' s exclusive fiduciary responsibility for plan operations. ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the proposed rule, cont act Alan H. Winkle, Executive Director of PERSI, 334- 3365. Anyone may submit written comments regarding the proposed rulemaking. All written comments must be directed to the undersigned and must be delivered on or before October 26, 2005.
