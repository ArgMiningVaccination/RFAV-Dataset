Studies show 50 to 70 percent of influenza-related hospitalizations are the same groups. These individuals tend to have weaker immune systems. This means they need more help protecting against the flu virus. What is a High-Dose Flu Vaccination? The high-dose flu vaccine is specially formulated for people over the age of 65 or the immune-compromised. The vaccine provides additional flu antigens that help the body develop immunity to the virus. This helps these individuals stay healthy throughout the flu season. Individuals under the age of 65 or who do not have a compromised immune system should consider the [standard quadrivalent flu shot](/vaccines/quadrivalent-flu/). How Does a High-Dose Flu Vaccine Help? As people get older, their immune system needs more help fighting off the influenza virus. Others may have immune-compromising conditions, like diabetes or genetic disorders. These individuals tend to produce as much as 75 percent fewer antibodies than others. This means they are significantly less protected than many in the general population. The high-dose flu vaccine is designed to help the body produce the correct amount of antibodies. This helps ensure that the individual stays protected throughout the flu season. Seniors or compromised individuals have a significantly lower chance of contracting influenza if they have received the high-dose vaccine. How is a High-Dose Flu Vaccine Different? The main difference from a regular flu shot is that a high-dose flu shot has four times the amount of flu virus antigen. Another difference is that a high-dose flu vaccine is only approved for individuals over 65 or that have immunocompromising conditions. The extra antigens are meant to help these individuals stay healthy and FluFree all year long. Is the High-Dose Flu Vaccine Safe? The high-dose flu vaccine has been found safe by the CDC, FDA and other health organizations. As with any medication, side effects can occur but are generally rare and mild. "}
