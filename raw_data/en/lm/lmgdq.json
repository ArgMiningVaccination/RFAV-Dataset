This study investigated the associations between R/S and RCT about COVID-19 vaccination and the links of R/S with vaccine refusal and hesitancy. A sample of Czech adults (n = 459) participated in the survey. We measured R/S, RCT, religious fundamentalism, and COVID-19 vaccination intentions. We found spirituality to be significantly associated with RCT belief, with odds ratios (OR) of 2.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-3.19). A combination of R/S groups revealed that spirituality with non-religious affiliation was associated with higher beliefs in RCT, with ORs from 3.51 to 7.17. Moreover, associations were found between spirituality with non-religious affiliation [OR 2.22(1.33-7.76)] with vaccine refusal. Our findings showed associations of spirituality and religious fundamentalism with RCT about COVID-19 vaccination. Furthermore, spirituality was linked to a higher possibility of vaccine refusal. Understanding these associations may help prevent the development of RCT and negative impact of spirituality on vaccine intentions and contribute to the effectiveness of the vaccination process.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-10-10", "cleaned_text": "Vaccine Refusal in the Czech Republic Is Associated with Being Spiritual but Not Religiously Affiliated [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9101157](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9101157) [COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance and Uptake: Insights from /journal/vaccines/special_issues/Vaccine_Acceptance )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-09-01157), [2](#B2-vaccines-09-01157)]. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, millions of laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, along with 4 million reported deaths as of June 2021 [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-01157)]. Although there are ways to prevent the spread of infection, such as social distancing, contact tracing, testing, or the use of masks, these measures have been shown to be insufficient in reducing virus transmission and its consequences [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-01157), [5](#B5-vaccines-09-01157)] when compared to vaccination. According to several studies, a significant reduction of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality can only be achieved by mass vaccination (e.g., [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-01157), [6](#B6-vaccines-09-01157), [7](#B7-vaccines-09-01157)]). Therefore, simultaneously with the spread of the virus, various COVID-19 vaccines have been developed by different pharmaceutical companies and subsequently approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). These are derived from multiple platforms and include different vaccines types [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-01157), [9](#B9-vaccines-09-01157), [10](#B10-vaccines-09-01157)]. [11](#B11-vaccines-09-01157)], since the herd immunity resulting from vaccines may control or eliminate the infection only if the effective vaccination rate is sufficiently high [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-01157), [6](#B6-vaccines-09-01157)] Moreover, low vaccination coverage may increase the emergence of more transmissible variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-01157)]. Yet, some individuals question, hesitate, or refuse particular vaccines or vaccination in general [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-01157), [13](#B13-vaccines-09-01157)]. Similarly, studies on COVID-19 vaccination acceptance suggest that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and refusal are increasing worldwide on average [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-01157), [14](#B14-vaccines-09-01157)]. Research has shown that the common reasons for COVID-19 vaccines refusal or hesitancy are a fear of side effects, safety and effectiveness, doubts about the correct development or approval of vaccines or their necessity, the unknown duration of immunity following vaccination, and a general anti-vaccine stance (see [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-01157)] for a review). Nevertheless, determinants of vaccine uptake can be more complex and multifaceted [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-01157), [15](#B15-vaccines-09-01157)], involving cognitive, emotional, cultural, social, spiritual, or political factors [1; 13]. Moreover, the reasons contributing to hesitancy can be more specific to the particular individuals or subgroups within a population as well as the context [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-01157)]. Circumstances, such as attitudes, context, culture, and beliefs regarding COVID-19 vaccines, are therefore important factors in minimizing vaccination refusal or hesitancy. [12](#B12-vaccines-09-01157), [16](#B16-vaccines-09-01157), [17](#B17-vaccines-09-01157), [18](#B18-vaccines-09-01157)], since they can empower some people to take responsibility for their health [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-01157)]. Religiosity, which can be described in terms of church attendance, institutional beliefs, and rituals and theology prescribed by a particular institution [ [20](#B20-vaccines-09-01157)], has been explored as an important theme when discussing vaccination and shaping decisions for uptake [ [18](#B18-vaccines-09-01157), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-01157), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-01157)]. Spirituality, perceived as an individual's contentedness towards a Higher Power, a sense of the meaning of life, a search for harmony, and spiritual well-being [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-01157)], has been found to influence how people cope with health issues and care for their bodies [ [16](#B16-vaccines-09-01157), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-01157)]. However, spiritual worldviews [ [23](#B23-vaccines-09-01157)] or moral issues connected to religion [ [24](#B24-vaccines-09-01157)] can also be connected to general anti-vaccination behavior. Moreover, in all major religions, groups may be found with a strong adherence to their basic principles and a decisive expression of disagreement with modern society and science, which can be characterized as religious fundamentalism [ [25](#B25-vaccines-09-01157), [26](#B26-vaccines-09-01157)]. Fundamentalism has been associated with a devotion to strict religious interpretations and practices that provide clear rules for living, leaning towards dogma, distinctions between the secular and the religious, antimodernism, and to a sense that individuals' lives are sanctioned and supported by God [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-01157), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-01157)]. This ideology of religious exclusivity was found to be connected to general anti-vaccine attitudes [ [18](#B18-vaccines-09-01157), [24](#B24-vaccines-09-01157)] and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-01157), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-01157)]. Thus, it can represent a potential barrier to vaccine uptake [ [31](#B31-vaccines-09-01157)] and be a source of hesitancy [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-01157)]. [32](#B32-vaccines-09-01157), [33](#B33-vaccines-09-01157)]. Research suggests that beliefs in conspiracy theories (CT) have a negative influence on the health domain [ [32](#B32-vaccines-09-01157), [34](#B34-vaccines-09-01157), [35](#B35-vaccines-09-01157)], including a harmful effect on vaccine uptake in general [ [36](#B36-vaccines-09-01157), [37](#B37-vaccines-09-01157)]. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has also mobilized groups spreading various CT [ [38](#B38-vaccines-09-01157), [39](#B39-vaccines-09-01157), [40](#B40-vaccines-09-01157)], and such beliefs were found to be associated with distrust in COVID-19 vaccines [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-01157)], vaccine hesitancy, and refusal [ [42](#B42-vaccines-09-01157)]. Although an individual's R/S has been found to play a role in the endorsement of conspiracies, and a religious way of thinking may furthermore facilitate one's attraction to conspiracies [ [32](#B32-vaccines-09-01157), [43](#B43-vaccines-09-01157)], studies on associations between R/S and RTC about COVID-19 vaccines are lacking. Therefore, it is important to understand the R/S foundations of worldviews that can support the formation of religious conspiracy theories (RCT) [ [30](#B30-vaccines-09-01157), [44](#B44-vaccines-09-01157)] and the possible links of R/S with COVID-19 vaccine intentions in order to strengthen this vaccine acceptance. [45](#B45-vaccines-09-01157)], is characterized by a high degree of secularization, as most people do not report any religious affiliation or regular church attendance [ [45](#B45-vaccines-09-01157)]. This setting can make it an interesting research area for assessing the links between R/S and beliefs in RCT and their associations with the COVID-19 vaccine uptake intentions. The findings from a secular country can help us to describe the basis from which beliefs in RCT may arise and to understand what variables may underlie decisions about vaccination. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the associations between the role of R/S, religious fundamentalism, and beliefs in RCT and to examine their associations with the COVID-19 vaccine uptake. 2. Methods 2.1. Participants and Procedure [46](#B46-vaccines-09-01157)]. The online survey was prepared at the researcher's institution and conducted by a professional agency Czech National Panel ( [ceskynarodnipanel.cz](http://ceskynarodnipanel.cz), accessed on 2 September 2021). This agency is one of the leading providers of online data collection and a reliable source of respondents for surveys in the Czech Republic. The participants were chosen with the help of quota sampling based on the criteria that allowed the construction of a sample close to the adult Czech representative samples. The agency used online methods of contacting the respondents, who are members of a stable panel and receive a reward for successful finishing of the questionnaire. This ensures achieving a balanced sample regarding age and gender. The number of respondents who received a prompt to join the survey is unknown, as it depended on repletion of individual quotas during the time. At the end of the data collection, the final sample was 1662 participants. However, visual screening indicated four cases of uniform pattern responses, i.e., responding to most of the items of the survey in the same way, which led to the exclusion of these respondents. After these four respondents were excluded, 1658 subjects remained. Consequently, in the next step, to ensure high quality of data, low-quality respondents were excluded following two criteria: (1) a very short period of time filling in the survey that would not have allowed responding to the questions thoughtfully (i.e., less than 15 min for a survey lasting around an hour); (2) responding inconsistently to control questions regarding years, weight, and height (i.e., respondents who reported a difference of two and more units of measure). After exclusion of these problematic subjects (n = 166), the remaining sample consisted of 1492 respondents. RCT beliefs and fundamentalism were assessed only among respondents who reported themselves as religious; thus, the final sample consisted of 459 participants (mean age = 51.46, SD = 16.05; 49.9% male). 2.2. Measures [47](#B47-vaccines-09-01157)]. The present study used an adapted 15-item version of the scale validated for the Czech environment [ [48](#B48-vaccines-09-01157)]. The items are evaluated on a six-point modified Likert scale graded according to the intensity of the experience of the observed phenomena, ranging from \"never\" (1) to \"many times a day\" (6). The last item on the scale, the question \"How close to God do you feel in general?\" has only four options, ranging from \"not at all\" (1) to \"as close as possible\" (4). A higher intensity of experience corresponds to higher levels of spiritual experience. For the purposes of our analysis, the DSES score was treated as continuous, but for the assessment of different combinations of religious affiliation and spirituality with RCT, it was also dichotomized in the following way: We computed the total score ranging from 15 to 88 points. The respondents with a score of 51 or higher, i.e., above the middle of the score, were considered spiritual, and the rest as non-spiritual. Cronbach's alpha for the whole scale has an excellent internal consistency, with = 0.96 in our sample. [49](#B49-vaccines-09-01157)]. The instrument was developed to assess a personal orientation that promotes a supra-human locus of moral authority, a contextual truth, and appreciation of the sacred over worldly experiences [ [49](#B49-vaccines-09-01157)]. Therefore, the instrument comprises three subscales to measure three dimensions of religious fundamentalism: External versus internal authority; Fixed versus malleable religion; Rejection versus affirmation of the world. Each of the dimensions consists of five items rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from \"totally disagree\" (1) to \"totally agree\" (5). For the purposes of our analysis, the MDFI score was treated as a continuous variable. Cronbach's alpha for the MDFI total scale in the current sample was 0.62. 2.3. Statistical Analyses 3. Results 3.1. Description of the Population [Table 1](#vaccines-09-01157-t001). Of the whole sample (mean age = 51.46, SD = 16.05; 49.9% male), 24.6% of respondents hold RCT beliefs related to COVID-19 vaccination. Furthermore, 21.8% reported vaccine refusal and 22.2% vaccine hesitancy. 3.2. Beliefs in Religious Conspiracy Theories around COVID-19 Vaccination [Table 2](#vaccines-09-01157-t002)shows the associations of religious affiliation, spirituality, and their different combinations with the RCT related to COVID-19 vaccination. We assessed the following combinations of religious affiliation and spirituality: spiritual and religiously affiliated (S+RA; n = 55), spiritual but non-religiously affiliated (S+NRA; n = 35), non-spiritual but religiously affiliated (NS+RA; n = 72), non-spiritual and non-religiously affiliated (NS+NRA; n = 290). The number of respondents in each category is in line with the study of religiosity in the Czech Republic based on a representative sample [ [45](#B45-vaccines-09-01157)] and other studies on R/S [ [50](#B50-vaccines-09-01157), [51](#B51-vaccines-09-01157), [52](#B52-vaccines-09-01157)]. These results suggest that although some people from the Czech population consider themselves believers, they seeks spiritual fulfilment outside traditional religious institutions. We found that respondents with higher levels of spirituality were significantly more likely to believe in RCT, with odd ratios ranging from 1.37 (1.02-1.84) to 2.12 (1.42-3.19) for the adjusted model. Particularly, the strongest association was found for the opinion that the rejection of the COVID-19 vaccine is an act of true faith and trust in God. Moreover, a combination of groups revealed that spiritual but not religiously affiliated respondents had a significantly higher increase in the odds of RCT beliefs (ranging from 3.70 to 6.39). 3.3. COVID-19 Vaccine Intentions [Table 3](#vaccines-09-01157-t003)depicts the results of multinominal logistic regression, with the cluster of respondents who accepted vaccination as the reference category. Attitudes towards vaccination were assessed in association with RCT beliefs, R/S and their different combinations, and with fundamentalism. Spiritual respondents were more likely (a 37% increase in the odds) to refuse vaccination. Moreover, compared to non-spiritual non-affiliated respondents, respondents who were spiritual but non-religiously affiliated were about 4.43 times more likely to refuse the vaccination. Similarly, this group had a significantly (2.88 times) higher chance to hesitate regarding vaccine acceptance. 4. Discussion [20](#B20-vaccines-09-01157), [50](#B50-vaccines-09-01157)], we may suppose that individuals with higher levels of spirituality, in their efforts to find and explain the meaning of COVID-19, lean towards conspiracy ideas connected to their spiritual worldviews [ [33](#B33-vaccines-09-01157), [53](#B53-vaccines-09-01157)]. Thus, the associations of spirituality with the assessed RCT beliefs are in line with studies that showed that personal ideology and individual attitudes, including esotericism and belief in the healing and sacred power of one's own body, play a fundamental role in the creation of and beliefs in conspiracy theories [ [53](#B53-vaccines-09-01157)]. Similarly, beliefs in RCT can reflect perceived threats and assimilate spiritual thoughts into the narrative structure in which they exist [ [30](#B30-vaccines-09-01157), [54](#B54-vaccines-09-01157)]. They may also stem from seeking spiritual purity, an effort to create an ideal reinterpreted past or cling to a perfect post-apocalyptic era [ [30](#B30-vaccines-09-01157), [55](#B55-vaccines-09-01157)]. Therefore, respondents with higher levels of spirituality may have a tendency to believe in RCT that are based on apocalyptic ideas or defend alternative forms of medicine [ [23](#B23-vaccines-09-01157)]. [56](#B56-vaccines-09-01157)] or Sturm and Albrecht [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-01157)]. These studies were conducted in countries with the predominant Christian religion, such as Poland [ [56](#B56-vaccines-09-01157)] or the USA [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-01157)], nevertheless, their research focus was either not connected to vaccination but focused on the foundations of the Christian faith and morals, i.e., RCT about gender and marriage [ [56](#B56-vaccines-09-01157)], or used narratives specific to Christian narratives, i.e., apocalyptical or millennial [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-01157)]. Thus, we can suppose that the affiliated respondents did not see the RCT beliefs around COVID-19 vaccination as threatening their religious identity, interfering with the teachings of the church [ [39](#B39-vaccines-09-01157), [56](#B56-vaccines-09-01157)], or as a sign of the end of the world. Moreover, as our study was conducted after the Catholic church released an official encouragement for people to get vaccinated [ [57](#B57-vaccines-09-01157)], we may assume that our respondents, whose denomination is mainly Catholic, were following the teaching of the church and did not link COVID-19 vaccines with RCT. Nevertheless, beliefs in RCT were found to be associated with fundamentalism. Therefore, we may assume that not the affiliation to religion itself but the specific type of religious involvement may play an essential role in RCT endorsement. These results are in line with the findings of some other authors [ [32](#B32-vaccines-09-01157), [58](#B58-vaccines-09-01157)], who showed links between identification with a specific religious ingroup and reinforced beliefs in conspiracy theories and with perceiving non-religious outgroups as immoral and evil. Religious fundamentalism with conservative views and clinging to traditions and anti-modernism [ [55](#B55-vaccines-09-01157)] may lead to perceiving outgroups as underestimating moral values that their religion represents [ [30](#B30-vaccines-09-01157), [56](#B56-vaccines-09-01157)] and threatens the ingroup identity [ [32](#B32-vaccines-09-01157)]. Moreover, the type of religion may be connected to the way some people use their R/S to cope with and understand difficult life situations [ [59](#B59-vaccines-09-01157)]. They may use strategies characterized by an ominous view of the world and conflict with people in a religious community. Therefore, not religion itself, but strong attachment to its specific forms may reinforce beliefs in RCT and increase their demarcation from others, even within the same religion [ [39](#B39-vaccines-09-01157), [53](#B53-vaccines-09-01157)]. In addition, these extreme believers can spread RCT very effectively, because they often have a social network in which such theories can be mutually supported by like-minded people [ [23](#B23-vaccines-09-01157)]. [16](#B16-vaccines-09-01157), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-01157), [60](#B60-vaccines-09-01157)]. The factors associated with spiritual objections may comprise a belief in the natural healing potential of the body and in alternative forms of medicine, including prayer and strong faith [ [23](#B23-vaccines-09-01157), [60](#B60-vaccines-09-01157)], moral issues regarding the content of a vaccine, or the conviction that the disease is given by a Higher Power and can be withstood by the immune system [ [61](#B61-vaccines-09-01157)]. However, the findings of our study showed a discrepancy with authors that identified religion as a barrier to vaccine uptake and a source of hesitancy [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-01157), [18](#B18-vaccines-09-01157), [31](#B31-vaccines-09-01157)]. The majority of religions do not have doctrinal objections to vaccination, and vaccines are treated as an important measure to preserve health, \"to care for the temple of one's body\", and to strengthen solidarity with others through the protection of the entire society [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-01157), [24](#B24-vaccines-09-01157), [62](#B62-vaccines-09-01157)]. This is why we may argue that not religion itself but only some religious communities, usually orthodox or with conservative interpretations of scripture, may share negative attitudes towards vaccination [ [18](#B18-vaccines-09-01157), [51](#B51-vaccines-09-01157), [63](#B63-vaccines-09-01157)], as shown in our study conducted in a secular country where only a low percentage of religious people are predominantly Christian. Therefore, our results based on data from the secular environment of the Czech Republic are rather in line with studies, showing that spirituality without religious affiliation may lead to health-risk behavior [ [52](#B52-vaccines-09-01157), [64](#B64-vaccines-09-01157)], supporting this idea even in the field of vaccination. 4.1.
