[+] [+] Key Clinical Points - Spirituality is an important coping strategy for the older adult population who experience age-related losses, disabilities, physical illnesses, and mortality confronted in old age and is associated with a number of positive outcomes. - Spiritual screening or history should be a routine part of a comprehensive clinical assessment and can identify spiritual distress and spiritual resources of strength and integrate these into the whole person assessment and treatment or care plan. - Generalist spiritual care is the responsibility of all members of the clinical team; the team should also include referral to and collaboration with specialist spiritual care professionals. - Studies suggest benefits of spiritual interventions such as spiritual reminiscence and dignity therapy.

Yet in a complicated health system, the patient who suffers often has no one that can listen to his or her despair, grief, and isolation. There may be no one to give voice to their inner "}
