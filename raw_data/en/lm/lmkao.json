CooneyEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015 III EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015 III Ethics: Ethical practice yields professional and personal satisfaction A recent survey asked AAEP members to rank issues based on importance to them on a personal level. Among the top five concerns were ethics (No. 2) and public image (No. 5). A strong interest in ethics and public image is healthy, not only for the veterinarians themselves, but also for their clients and patients. Historically, veterinarians have always ranked among the top professions regarding honesty and ethical standards, according to Gallup polling. The survey of AAEP members indicates that equine veteri-narians continue to realize the importance of ethical behavior and are concerned about maintaining a positive public image. This is exciting news for the future of our profession! A veterinarian's public image is affected by multiple factors, including knowledge, competence, caring, avail-ability and certainly ethics. Merriam-Webster defines ethics simply as \"rules of behavior based on ideas about what is good and bad.\" The AAEP Ethical and Professional Guidelines states in its Standards of Profession: \"Professional ethics embodies the behaviors of honesty, integrity and kindness while obeying rules and regulations set forth with mutual respect for opinion and preservation of dignity in interpersonal relationships. The conduct should be in a manner that will enhance the worthiness of the profession.\" The authors of the AAEP guidelines obviously spent a great deal of time and effort writing a definition of pro-fessional ethics. They did this because they knew that for equine veterinary medicine to grow and thrive, ethical practice is essential. We all have an obligation to practice ethically and to encourage our colleagues to practice in an ethical manner. Everyone faces ethical challenges and, in most cases, we respond appropriately. Some instances are easier than others, and in general the more often we make the right choice, the easier it becomes to consistently make the correct ethical decision. With this in mind, it is incumbent upon older, experienced practitioners to offer support and advice to their colleagues who are facing ethical dilemmas. Wisdom shared by a fellow veterinarian can have an incredible impact on his or her colleagues. I still remember advice I received from Dr. Harley Sutton years ago when I took the Kentucky State Board examination: \"Never be dishonest to help a client because the client will then know that if you were dishonest to help him, you could also be dishonest to hurt him.\" While positive reinforcement is generally the best motivating factor, there may be times (and clients) when the more powerful motivation is fear of the loss of your license to practice veterinary medicine or the embarrass-ment of public censure. There may be some clients who are unable to understand the importance of ethical behavior, but they can understand that if you are unethical you could lose your AAEP membership and your license, causing both you and the client to face possible public ridicule. As mentioned earlier, the general public holds veterinari- ans in very high esteem concerning honesty and ethics. We should all be very proud of the respect the public has for us, and we should take personal responsibility to maintain the high standards that our community expects from us. As Dr. David Ramey wisely stated during his presentation at the 2013 AAEP Annual Convention, \"Ethical standards and behavior provide confidence to the public about the reliability and actions they can expect when using the services of a professional. They build trust. In maintaining a strong veterinarian-client relationship, trust is essential. Trust can be hard to both gain and maintain, but it can be lost very easily.\" In closing I call on all of us to follow the AAEP guidelines and practice with \"honesty, integrity, and kindness.\" We should do this because it's the right choice for our clients, our patients, and the public; but most of all, because it's the right decision for our own personal well-being. Dr. Riddle is a founding partner of Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital in Lexington, Ky., and chair of the AAEP's Professional Conduct and Ethics Committee. Dr. W. Thomas Riddle By W. Thomas Riddle, DVM \"...it is incumbent upon older, experienced practitioners to offer support and advice to their colleagues who are facing ethical dilemmas.

EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015 V The 5th Annual Equitarian Workshop, funded in part by the AAEP Foundation and held Oct. 19-26, 2014, brought much- needed medical care to approximately 350 working equids in Granada, Managua and Ometepe, Nicaragua. Perhaps more importantly, the workshop underscored the continuing transition of Equitarianism into a model for creating sustain-able change in underdeveloped nations. \"The initial workshop (in Veracruz, Mexico, 2010) was a wonderful immersion experience for the first-time partici-pants, who essentially played the role of veterinary students in an existing Mexico project,\" said Dr. Julie Wilson, co-coordinator with Dr. David Turoff of the Equitarian Workshop. \"Over the years, the workshop has become more focused on making this kind of work sustainable and defining the issues in the working equid population. It's no longer just 'what can the Americans do?' but a more global and diverse perspective regarding different approaches to assisting working equids.\" Incorporating local veterinary students and existing interna- tional resources are key components of sustainability efforts. At the time of the initial workshop, Equitarians would converge on an area of need and deliver medical services for a week or two before returning home. Now, for instance, Dr. Wilson will not pursue an Equitarian project if it doesn't involve partnering with a local veterinary school or incorpo-rating on-the-ground support from a strong partner such as World Horse Welfare, a UK-based charity aimed at improving the lives of horses around the world. World Horse Welfare provided farriers and harness makers to assist at the workshop. The charity has established long-term programs in Central America and elsewhere through which small teams educate local horse owners and advance the skills of horse service providers. Additional charities to contribute to the workshop included UK-based The Donkey Sanctuary, which provided several participants who also presented during daily classroom forums; and U.S.-based RVETS (Rural Veterinary Experience Teaching and Service), which provided use of their bus to transport participants from Granada to daily work sites. Other non-profits represented at the workshop included Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association, Sustainable Vets International, World Vets and Christian Veterinary Mission. Also among the record 56 workshop participants were 16 veterinary students, including 14 from Nicaragua's University of Commercial Sciences. According to Dr. Wilson, making training available to local veterinary students raises their level of clinical expertise and instills in them a sense community service. \"The connections the students make will enable their further participation in Equitarian work and potentially lead to externships in the U.S. and elsewhere,\" she said. \"Inspiring better equine skills is one of the things we hope to do, and certainly our first-world veterinarians enjoy sharing their basic skills with the students.\" Student-participants worked alongside practitioners to treat a variety of ailments, including many malnutrition, respirato-ry, dental, castration and vampire bat bite cases. Participants also treated harness wounds on cart horses and saw several cases of \"spider bite,\" a form of vesicular stomatitis that causes a painful and devastating change in the hoof whereby the affected portion is eventually sloughed off. Supplementing administered treatments was initiation of a pilot project to help determine underlying infectious diseases and parasites in the region's equid population. Preliminary data collected by participant Dr. Sara Gomez indicated that 80% of the 35 randomly sampled horses tested positive for babesiosis, and 60% were positive for both forms of the disease. Considerably fewer\u201411%\u2014tested positive for Equine Infectious Anemia while 61% had a high parasite burden, reflecting the need for parasite control and owner education. Parallel projects are planned for upcoming Equitarian trips in other Central American countries.

Dr. Tracy TurnerVI EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015 Eight honored with AAEP Foundation/Markel scholarships Eight exceptional veterinary students committed to careers in equine medicine received $2,500 scholarships from the AAEP Foundation and Markel during the AAEP's 60th Annual Convention in Salt Lake City, Utah. Now in its 26th year, the annual scholarship program awards financial support to fourth-year veterinary students who are proven leaders at their veterinary schools, advocates for equine welfare, and academic achievers. Since inception of the program in 1989, 186 veterinary students have received more than $400,000 in scholarship support. Congratulations to the following 2014 recipients: Zach Badura Iowa State University Zach Badura came to appreciate the athletic ability of the performance horse at an early age while growing up in Minnesota around the horseracing industry. He has worked as an exercise rider and veterinary assistant every summer since age 16, first at Canterbury Park in Shakopee, Minn., and most recently at Arapahoe Park in Aurora, Colo. He served as vice president of his AAEP student chapter and would like to get involved with organized veterinary medicine after becoming estab-lished in his career. Following graduation, Badura intends to return to Colorado and pursue a career focused on equine sports medicine and lameness. Elodie Huguet University of GeorgiaBorn and raised in the French Alps, Elodie Huguet developed an interest in equine medicine when introduced to horses after moving with her family to Aiken, S.C., in 2001. An accomplished artist and active dressage rider, Huguet served as president of her AAEP student chapter and helped organize numerous educational events for students and owners. Her primary interests are surgery, imaging and sport horse medicine. Huguet has accepted an internship with Virginia Equine Imaging in The Plains, Va. Following her internship, she intends to apply for a residency in diagnostic imaging. Rebecca Legere Kansas State UniversityAn unsatisfying stint as a systems engineer prompted Rebecca Legere to channel her childhood dream and return to school to pursue veterinary medicine. While coordi-nating wet labs and other oppor-tunities to expand the knowledge and skills of her AAEP student chapter colleagues, Legere has worked as a technician in the clinical pathology lab and equine ICU. She will enter an internship at Weatherford Equine Medical Center in Weatherford, Texas, following graduation. Thereafter, Legere intends to pursue a residency in equine internal medicine and would like to complete advanced training in teaching or a Ph.D. Molly Muedeking Royal Veterinary CollegeAlthough she didn't decide on a career in veterinary medicine until after obtaining her bachelor's degree, Molly Muedeking suggests that it was an inevitable profession for one who spent as much time at the barn playing polo as she did. Originally from Baltimore, Md., Muedeking helped start the AAEP's first overseas student chapter and has a particular interest in contributing to the growing discussion of burn out and depression within the veterinary profession. Muedeking will complete an internship at Blue Ridge Equine Clinic in Earlysville, Va., before pursuing an ambulatory career focused on sport horse medicine. Stephanie Regan University of FloridaAs the daughter of a cardiologist, Fort Myers, Fla., native Stephanie Regan has always possessed a love of medicine. Equine medicine became her focus while at Harvard University, where she captained the school's polo team. An active member of her AAEP student chapter, Regan piloted its Colic Team program and helped create a Blacksmith Buddies program to provide students with additional training and educational opportunities beyond the classroom. Regan has accepted a rotating hospital internship with Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital in Lexington, Ky., and subsequently hopes to pursue a surgical residency and graduate research. EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015 VII Holly Roessner Michigan State University Enrollment in riding lessons and the United States Pony Club sparked Holly Roessner's equine interest soon after moving with her family from Germany to New Jersey at the age of nine. While an undergrad at Rutgers University, Roessner worked at an equine referral hospital and under the mentorship of a pair of ambulatory practitioners with sport horse clientele. During her first two summers of veterinary school, Roessner conducted research with Dr. Sue Holcombe on possible markers for post-partum colic and on surgical management of dysphagia in horse. She plans to obtain an academic equine internship followed by a residency in sports medicine or surgery. Esther Rogers Auburn UniversityVermont native Esther Rogers was introduced to equine medicine as an ICU technician at Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital in Lexington, Ky., while pursuing her bachelor's in equine studies. After graduation, Rogers spent five years as the equine center director for a Central Kentucky program that aids at-risk youth before joining the Kentucky Horse Council, where she served as director of education and welfare for three years until enrolling at Auburn. She has a particular interest in sport horse medicine and lameness. Rogers will complete an internship at Tennessee Equine Hospital in Thompson's Station, Tenn. Bailee Stanton University of SaskatchewanRaised on her family's dude ranch in Kananaskis, Alberta, Bailee Stanton has ridden and cared for horses from a young age. She competed in multiple disciplines while growing up before focusing on rodeo, in which she has competed in both amateur and professional events. She served as president of her AAEP student chapter and planned the club's first annual \"Alberta Equine Trip\" for knowledge and networking. Stanton has accepted an internship with Moore Equine Veterinary Centre in Rocky View County, Alberta. Afterward, she intends to either enter private practice or apply for a residency in large animal surgery or equine sports medicine. According to AAEP market research, 26% of horse owners use a non-veterinarian for equine dental care. Why? Some owners perceive lay providers who have attended an equine dentistry certification course as being a specialist, thus more qualified to care for their horse's mouth. Others say their primary equine veterinarian does not offer dental care and they must look elsewhere for this service. Equine dentistry is an integral branch of professional equine veterinary practice. A licensed veterinarian is the most educated, accountable and trained individual to provide equine dental care.If your clients do not use your practice for equine dental care, it is likely because of one of three reasons: r\u0001 \"\u0001MBZ\u0001QSPWJEFS\u0001IBT\u0001QPTJUJPOFE\u0001IJNTFMG\u0001PS\u0001IFSTFMG\u0001BT\u0001B\u0001 more qualified provider of care; r\u0001 :PVS\u0001QSBDUJDF\u0001EPFT\u0001OPU\u0001DVSSFOUMZ\u0001PGGFS\u0001UIJT\u0001TFSWJDF\u0001BOE\u0001 your clients must find other providers; or r\u0001You offer dental services but your clients don't know it.

Page and colleagues at the University of Kentucky, USA, investigated the effect of passively acquiredantibodies on Lawsonia intracellularis infection and immunity in the horse. It is well understood that equine proliferative enteropathy caused by Lawsonia intracellularis affects weanling horses. The reasons for this have not been documented and a decline inpassively acquired antibodies has been hypothesised. Thisstudy investigated the effect of the decline in maternalantibodies on the development of clinical or subclinicalequine proliferative enteropathy in 453 mare and foal pairs.Serum samples were taken within 48 h of parturition and atmonthly intervals thereafter until the foals were yearlings.Antibody status was measured using an enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA); disease status was eithersubclinical (if there were no clinical signs buthypoalbuminaemia was detected) or clinical, if clinical signswere apparent. At the initial post partum sample 44.2% ofmares and 38% seropositive horsesdeveloped clinical or subclinical disease, respectively. Therewas no effect of maternal antibody status on thedevelopment of subclinical or clinical disease. Colts werefound to be significantly more likely than fillies to developclinical disease (odds ratio 5.468) and foals weaned later wereat lower risk of developing clinical disease (odds ratio 0.281). This study shows that passively acquired antibodies to Lawsonia intracellularis to do not have an effect on the development of clinical or subclinical equine proliferativeenteropathy, therefore additional factors associated with theweaning period, such as stress, may be the underlying reasonfor weanling predisposition to the disease. Sagittal distal limb kinematics inside the hoof In this recently published study, J. Roach and colleagues at theRoyal V eterinary College, UK, used and trotting horses . Evaluation of the distal limb using standard kinematic methods can be difficult, mainly due to the hoof capsulerestricting visualisation. The recent development of ahigh-speed fluoroscopy (HSF) system allows in vivo cineradiographic assessment of moving skeletal structures athigh speeds. In this study this non-invasive method was used todescribe 'internal' distal limb limb kinematic data were collected from 6non-lame horses at walk and trot using HSF set over a forceplate. The angles of and 75% of stance. ThePIPJ and DIPJ showed overall extension through stance.Significant differences were found in the range of motion(ROM) between gaits and changes through stance. The ROMof the PIPJ observed was similar to previously published resultsbut the ROM for the DIPJ was less than values previouslyreported.Following this successful use of HSF for kinematic assessment of the distal limb within the hoof capsule, theauthors suggest that HSF may also be used to estimate strain inthe tendons and ligaments within the hoof capsule, which area common site of lameness in the horse. Serum cortisol concentrations in horseswith colic In this study, Tim Mair and colleagues in the UK have evaluated serum cortisol concentrations in horses with colic . It is known that in humans with septic shock, high cortisol levels are associated with an increased risk of death; however ,few studies have evaluated cortisol concentrations in horseswith colic. In this study the authors aimed to compare theserum total cortisol concentrations (STCCs) in horses with colicto those without colic, and to assess whether the STCC relatesto the pathological nature or outcome of the disease. The STCCs in horses with colic and in systemically healthy 'control' horses were determined at presentation. Horses withcolic were grouped based on various parameters, as well astreatment, lesion type and outcome. Univariable andmultivariable logistic regression were performed using 2different outcome measures: whether the horse had colic ornot (yes vs. no); and horse STCC ( 200 nmol/l vs. <200 nmol/l). Horses were found to be more likely to have colic if theypresented with high STCCs, and horses with colic and highSTCCs were more likely to have moderate or severe colic signsand higher heart rates. The authors concluded that colic inhorses is associated with elevated STCCs, and increased STCCin horses with colic appears to relate to the severity of thedisease. Serum total cortisol concentrations may provideadditional decision-making and prognostic information inhorses with colic but further studies are required to avoidmisinterpretations associated with the wide variation in STCCs. Comparison of local analgesia techniques In this recent study, Kevin Claunch and colleagues at theUniversity of Georgia, USA, compared the effects of 2approaches and 2 injection volumes on diffusion ofmepivacaine hydrochloride for local analgesia of the deepbranch of the lateral plantar nerve (DBLPN) in 16 adult horses . Two techniques were used to inject either 2 ml (low- volume) or 8 ml (high-volume) of mepivacaine hydrochloride-iohexol (50:50 mixture) to produce analgesia of the DBLPN. Fortechnique 1, the needle was inserted 15 mm distal to the headof the fourth metatarsal bone and directed perpendicularto the limb. For technique 2, the needle was inserted 20 mmdistal to the head of the fourth metatarsal bone andwas directed in a proximodorsal direction. Lateromedialradiographs were obtained before and 5, 15, 30 and 60minutes after injection. Radiographs were evaluated todetermine the extent of diffusion of the contrastsolution/anaesthetic agent and the presence of contrastagent in the tarsal sheath or tarsometatarsal joint. Results indicated that the proximal and distal diffusion of the mepivacaine-iohexol solution was quite variable followingeither DBLPN nerve block technique. injectionsdiffused significantlyfurther distally with technique 1 but diffused significantly furtherproximally with technique 2. Contrast agent was present in thetarsal sheath in 16% of injections and in the tarsometatarsaljoint in 6% of injections. For both techniques, diffusion in thedistal but not the proximal direction significantly increasedover time. Equine glaucoma In this retrospective study, Elizabeth Curto and colleagues atOhio State University, USA, describe the histopathologicalfindings in equine globes enucleated due to glaucoma . Medical records over a 13-year period were reviewed and data were collected, histological slides of enucleated globeswere examined and lesions recorded, resulting in 23 eyes from23 horses eligible for inclusion in this study. In this study two-thirds of affected horses were >15 years of age and the most common breeds were Quarter Horses,Appaloosas and Thoroughbreds. The most commonhistopathological changes included hypercellularity of theoptic nerve, retinal atrophy, hypercellularity of theanterior was present in the majority of eyes. The authors concluded that equine glaucoma most commonly occurs secondary to uveitis with Appaloosas andolder horses predisposed. Histological changes arecomparable to previous reports of chronic glaucoma; notablefindings not previously described in the horse were posteriorbowing of the iris base and relative sparing of the superiorretina from atrophy associated with elevated intraocularpressure. Catastrophic musculoskeletal racing injuries In this retrospective case-control study Andrea Beisser andcolleagues in the USA aimed to determine the frequency ofand potential risk factors for catastrophic musculoskeletalinjuries (CMIs) in racing Quarter Horses . Data for Quarter Horses that sustained CMIs and the total number of race starts for each year were obtained from 2Midwestern racing jurisdictions for a 12-year period. For eachhorse with a CMI 2 control horses that ran in the same race butdid not incur a CMI were randomly selected and informationincluding past performance reports and video analysis wereobtained from race records. The study population comprised67 horses with CMIs and 134 matched control horses. At the 2 racetracks there were 61,797 race starts and 82 CMIs in the study period, with overall CMI incidence of 1.33CMIs/1000 starts, with no difference in the incidence of CMIsbetween the 2 racetracks or over the years studied. The rightforelimb was injured in over half of horses, with injures to thecarpus and metacarpophalangeal joint occurring mostfrequently. Case-control data indicated that the horses with aCMI had fewer starts, were more likely to have stumbled at thebreak, had a more erratic stride, were fatigued, and trailed inthe race, compared with matched controls from the sameraces. Over two-thirds of the horses were injured after or within10 yards before the finish line, irrespective of race distance. Theresults of this study may help identify racing Quarter Horses atrisk for CMIs. The cluster of injuries close to the finish lineprovides a specific focus for future research into methods of injury prevention in racehorses. Sample handling and ACTH concentration In this recent study performed in Australia, David Rendleand colleagues measured the effects of sample handlingand N-phenylmaleimide on concentration ofadrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) in equine plasma . Adrenocorticotrophic hormone is frequently measured as a diagnostic aid in the detection of pituitary pars intermediadysfunction (PPID). Delays in analysis of blood samples arefrequent with this test as external laboratories are ofteninvolved in analysis; the effect of delays of up to 48 h has notpreviously been measured. This study measured the effect oftime, centrifugation vs. gravity separation and the addition ofmaleimide (a protease inhibitor) on ACTH concentration. Eighthealthy horses and 8 horses with PPID were recruited, baselineACTH was measured immediately after sampling using achemiluminescent assay. Samples taken from each horsewere divided and subjected to the following procedures:centrifugation, centrifugation and addition of maleimide, orgravity separated and addition of maleimide. All sampleswere stored at 22\u00b0C. Each sample was then analysed 4, 8, 24and 48 h folllowing collection. There was no effect on theaddition of maleimide, there was a significant reduction inACTH concentration in horses with PPID between 4 and 8 hafter collection and a wider range of ACTH values wereidentified with increasing time in horses with PPID. There wassome variation in ACTH concentration over time but this wasnot considered to be clinically relevant and may only be ofsignificance in horses which had borderline ACTHconcentrations at the time of sampling. The method ofseparation and the addition of protease inhibitors had noeffect on ACTH concentration. S.

Two articles in this issue of Equine V eterinary Education describe neonatal sepsis, the primary cause of mortality inneonatal foals (Dunkel and Corley 2015; Taylor 2015). Sepsis isan unregulated, systemic inflammatory response to apresumed or documented bacterial infection that can lead tomultiple organ dysfunction and septic shock (unresponsivehypotension). Sepsis and septic shock have high mortality ratesin both human and veterinary medicine, and rapid, intensivetherapy is the best chance to improve outcomes. Notsurprisingly, sepsis is further complicated by multiple factorssuch as tissue perfusion, energy demand, and metabolism. Thefocus of this editorial is on the association between insulinresistance and sepsis, and how that applies to equine clinicalpractice. The clinical outcomes of metabolic dysfunction resulting from sepsis vary depending on cause of disease and age ormetabolic phenotype. As an example, septic neonatal foalstypically exhibit hypoglycaemia and hypoinsulinaemia(Barsnick et al . 2011), whereas septic human patients and septic mature horses are often hyperglycaemic and insulinresistant. The metabolic state changes through the progressionof the disease, as evidenced by foals that present withhypoglycaemia but become persistently hyperglycaemicduring the course of therapy. Sepsis and endotoxaemia areassociated with the development of insulin resistance in horses(Toth et al . 2008). Insulin resistance is defined as a lack of, or diminished response to physiological concentrations of insulin,and there are several mechanisms linking insulin resistanceand sepsis. Hormonal alterations induced by sepsis such asincreased concentrations of cortisol, glucagon, and growthhormone may all lead to development of insulin resistance.Inflammation inhibits the insulin intracellular signallingpathway; specifically the arm of the pathway mediated byphosphatidyl inositol kinase, which mediates metabolicfunctions such as formation(Muniyappa et 2007). factor- , interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 that are part of the systemic inflammatory response during sepsis can interferewith insulin signalling and glucose dynamics (Muniyappa et al . 2007). Lipotoxicity is a driver of insulin resistance with increasedrelease of inflammatory cytokines and leptin from adiposetissue, and decreased of the anti-inflammatory,insulin-sensitising hormone, adiponectin (Muniyappa et al . 2007). Horses already affected with insulin resistance andequine metabolic syndrome may be predisposed toexacerbation of problems if they become septic or areexposed to endotoxin (Toth et al . 2008). Although not always present, hyperglycaemia is a detrimental manifestation of insulin resistance in some horseswith sepsis. Hyperglycaemia was once thought to be acompensatory mechanism for severe illness, and while thismay be true to a certain extent, many experimental studiesand clinical trials have demonstrated that hyperglycaemiadue to sepsis is caused by severe stress, cellular damageand insulin resistance, and it is a negative prognostic indicator(V an den Berghe et al . 2009). Persistently high glucose concentrations are toxic to cells, which perpetuates thecascade of cellular damage initiated through the septic process. In horses and foals, hyperglycaemia (glucose>7.5 mmol/l) has a negative association with survival in critically ill patients (Hollis et al . 2008; Hassel et al . 2009), and recognition of hyperglycaemia may help the practitioner incounselling clients about severity of disease or treatmentoptions. Treatment of sepsis is multimodal; involving infection control, haemodynamic support and supportive therapiessuch as blood products and nutrition. In addition, diagnosisand management of metabolic derangements are alsoessential. Control of hyperglycaemia due to stress, insulinresistance, and cellular damage during sepsis is a commontarget of therapy. Glucose control is listed as a therapy of highimportance with good evidence (based on randomised,prospective, controlled clinical trials) in a recent multicentre,international consensus statement on increasing survival inseptic people (Dellinger et al . 2013). After the original studies strongly suggested that persistent hyperglycaemia increasedmortality associated with sepsis, very tight glucose control(maintaining glucose in the normal human range of<6.1 mmol/l) was advocated (V an den Berghe et al . 2009). What was discovered was that achieving this level of controlled to several instances of hypoglycaemia in those cases,which was just as detrimental to survival. The ability to controlglucose tightly in the normal range without becominghypoglycaemic varied between intensive care facilities withsome having excellent outcomes and others less so. Theseresults led to less strict recommendations in human medicine ofusing insulin infusions to maintain glucose below 10.3 mmol/lwith the lower limit above hypoglycaemia (Dellinger et al . 2013). There are no published clinical trials in horses comparingthe 2 approaches, but given the likely variability in manpower ,measurement devices and other resources between equineintensive care units, less strict glucose regulation seems like amore reasonable target. In our practice, the most common scenario in septic horses requiring glucose control is management of neonates ormature horses with parenteral nutrition or treatment ofhyperlipaemia in miniature horses. Hyperglycaemia is acommon problem when treating septic neonates withparenteral nutrition (Myers et al . 2009), and it also occurs in mature horses. Glucose concentrations can become veryelevated in these patients, and continuous rate infusions orrepeated doses of insulin are often required. It is currentlyunknown whether or not controlling glucose in foals receivingparenteral nutrition increases survival (Myers et al . 2009), but larger prospective studies are needed. We typically begininsulin therapy if glucose concentrations are >10-11 mmol/l (the renal threshold for glucose in the horse is about9.7 mmol/l) for at least 4 h, and then aim for maintenance ofglucose concentrations <9.7 mmol/l, with frequency of monitoring changing as the patient progresses. In the mature horse, there are links between insulin, hyperglycaemia, sepsis and laminitis that need to beconsidered and may contribute to the outcome of intensivelymanaged cases (Toth et al . 2009). Hyperglycaemia will lead to 57 \u00a9 2015 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015release of endogenous insulin, and lamellar pathology wasevident in experimental models mimicking this occurrence (deLaat et al . 2012). Therapeutically this is important both from the standpoint of recognising hyperglycaemia in septic horses andregulating the insulin infusions that may be required for control.As laminitis is a complication that is unique to the horse, humanrecommendations cannot be extrapolated regardingmanagement with regards to this issue. As always, correctionof the primary problem causing the sepsis with managementof other complications as they arise is recommended.Recognition of metabolic derangements such as insulinresistance associated with sepsis, and continuedexperimental, retrospective and prospective studies willprovide better guidance for treatment and better outcomesfor sepsis in horses and foals.

(2009) Clinical review: intensive insulintherapy in critically / AE / FEBRUARY 2015 Bisphosphonate For use in horses only. Brief Summary (For Full Prescribing Information, see package insert)CAUTION: Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. DESCRIPTION: Clodronate disodium and is manufactured from the tetrahydrate form. INDICATION: For the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Horses with hypersensitivity to clodronate disodium should not receive OSPHOS.WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. HUMAN WARNINGS: Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of accidental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: As a class, bisphosphonates may be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Sensitivity to drug associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Renal and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may be associated with plasma concentrations of the drug. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal impairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be monitored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Administration of bisphosphonates has been associated with abdominal pain (colic), discomfort, and agitation in horses. Clinica l signs usually occur shortly after drug administration and may be associated with alterations in intestinal motility. In horses treated with OSPHOS these clinical signs usually began within 2 hours of treatment. Horses should be monitored for at least 2 hours following administration of OSPHOS. Bisphosphonates affect plasma concentrations of some minerals and electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, immediately post-treatment, with effects lasting up to several hours. Caution should be used when administering bisphosphonates to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, hypocalcemia, etc.). The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in horses less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in breeding horses or pregnant or lactating mares. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of months to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the tot al dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Bisphosphonates have been shown to cause fetal developmental abnormalities in laboratory animals. The uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone ma y be greater than into maternal bone creating a possible risk for skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus. Many drugs, including bisphosphonates, may be excreted in milk and may be absorbed by nursing animals. Increased bone fragility has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair micro damage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; however, a causal relationship has not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions reported in the eld study were clinical signs of discomfort or nervousness, colic and/or pawing.

Dallap Radiology/Diagnostic Imaging, Cummings School of V eterinary Medicine at Tufts University, Grafton, Massachusetts; andDepartment of Clinical Studies, New Bolton Center, The University of Pennsylvania School of V eterinary Medicine, Kennett Summary Duodenal volvulus is an unreported cause of colic in the horse. This case report describes a 15-year-old Warmblood geldingevaluated for acute abdominal discomfort. Exploratoryceliotomy revealed duodenal volvulus and gastric ruptureresulting in severe, acute, septic peritonitis. To the authors'knowledge, this is the first report of a volvulus of the equineduodenum. Introduction V olvulus is the rotation of a piece of bowel around itsmesenteric axis by >180\u00b0. It is typically limited to mobile bowel segments with mesentery of adequate length to permitrotation. V olvulus often results in some degree of vascularcompromise, depending on severity. The duodenal mesenteryin mammals is described as a short attachment to the dorsalbody wall throughout life, therefore it should not lend itself tovolvulus formation (Roux et al . 2007). The duodenal mesentery in the horse has been well described, with a short attachmentto the dorsal body wall from its origin near the pylorus, coursingcaudal to the root of the mesentery and the caecum, andterminating near the duodenocolic ligament (Freeman 2012).Normal duodenal anatomy is typically thought to preventduodenal volvulus. Prevalence of gastric rupture in horses examined at necropsy ranges from 1 to 6% in veterinary teaching hospitalswith caseloads between 350 and 1650 (Tennant et al . 1972; Baker and Ellis 1981). The prevalence of gastric rupture in 1659horses presenting with signs of colic over a 7-year period washigher at 11% (Todhunter et al . 1986). Primary gastric rupture, defined as only affecting the stomach, may result from overeating readily fermentableforage (Todhunter et al . 1986). Other causes of include rapid ingestion of water or concentrates, especially after exercise. In60% (30/50) of cases, the cause cannot be identified (Kiperet al . 1990). Secondary gastric rupture results from an obstruction aboral to the stomach (Todhunter et al . 1986) such as small intestinal obstruction. Small intestinal obstruction can befunctional, nonstrangulating mechanical obstructions of theduodenum or jejunum, or 2012). Gastroduodenal disease resulting in gastric rupture occurs more frequently in foals and is typically secondary to severegastric or duodenal ulceration, or pyloric or duodenal stenosis.Gastroduodenal lesions in mature horses are most often due to neoplasia, and are fairly uncommon (Todhunter et al . 1986; Freeman 2012). Reports of successful treatment of gastricrupture, regardless of aetiology, are rare (Steenhaut et al . 1986; Hogan et al . 1995), and the condition is commonly considered fatal. Case history A retired 15-year-old Danish Warmblood gelding was admittedto the University of Pennsylvania's New Bolton Center with a 5hour history of severe, acute colic. The referring veterinarianreported that the horse had been found by the barn managerdown and thrashing in the stall 15 minutes before evaluation.The gelding was tachycardic at 80 beats/min, with absentborborygmi and an elevated rectal temperature of 38.8\u00b0C.Mucous membranes were pink and tacky with a normalcapillary refill time. A nasogastric tube was passed and yieldedfoul smelling gas, but no fluid reflux. Abdominal palpation per rectum revealed a gas distended viscus in the right caudodorsal abdomen. Due to persistent degree ofdiscomfort, referral was recommended. The owner declinedreferral, and the horse was treated with aggressive i.v.(30 3 h with no clinicalimprovement, the referring veterinarian recommendedeuthanasia. At this time, the owner consented to referral. Clinical findings On presentation to New Bolton Center , the horse was dull andsweating with diffuse muscle fasciculation. The gelding hadmultiple superficial abrasions over the tuber coxae and face, but was not actively showing signs of colic on presentation.Despite previous resuscitation, the gelding was tachycardicwith a heart rate of 80-100 beats/min, and had an elevatedrespiratory rate of 40 breaths/min with nostril flare. The geldinghad poor peripheral pulse quality, bilateral prolonged jugularrefill, and dark pink/muddy mucous membranes with a toxicline 3 s). No gastrointestinal borborygmi were appreciated. A nasogastric tube waspassed and no reflux was obtained, but advancementthrough the cardia was difficult and could not be confirmed.Palpation per rectum was suggestive of viscus rupture as gritty serosal surfaces were appreciated. Salient abnormalities on haematology and a chemistry panel included severe degenerative neutropenia (272 \u00d710 6 cells/l, bands 34 \u00d7106cells/l), 20 ml/kg bwt crystalloid bolusof isotonic crystalloid fluids was initiated. A second 14 gaugei.v. catheter was placed in the right jugular vein and a 4 ml/kgbwt bolus of 7.2% hypertonic saline was palpation , a strangulating small intestinal devitalised bowel and subsequent viscusrupture, or possible caecal rupture were considered primarydifferential diagnoses. A diagnostic plan was discussed with the farm manager (acting as agent, as the owner was abroad) and includedabdominal sonography and/or abdominocentesis to attemptto confirm devitalised bowel or viscus rupture. The farmmanager requested surgical exploration based onconversations with the owner , and the gelding was takenimmediately to surgery. Surgical findings Upon entering the abdomen, a copious amount of ingestaand gas were observed. The owner was notified and electedhumane euthanasia due to the grave prognosis. Severe diffuseperitonitis of the viscera and mesenteric structures wasappreciated. The colon and caecum were in the properorientation and relatively empty. A large, full thickness muraldefect was appreciated at the greater curvature of thestomach. The ileum was located and the small intestine wastraced orally to the duodenocolic ligament. The jejunum wascollapsed and showed no distension, so a diagnosis of primaryor idiopathic rupture was considered most likely. The duodenum was traced from the duodenocolic ligament, traversing orally caudal to the root of the mesenteryand caecum, towards the right kidney. Markedly distendedduodenum could be appreciated near the right kidney. Avolvulus was identified and corrected. After correction, it waspossible to elevate the duodenum almost to the level of theventral midline incision, and the mesoduodenum wasestimated to be approximately 25 cm long. A small band ofmesentery and adipose tissue was associated with theduodenal serosal surface approximately 180\u00b0 from themesenteric attachment, roughly 4 cm aboral to the affectedduodenal segment. The remainder of the exploratoryceliotomy was consistent with peritonitis secondary to gastricrupture. Post mortem findings The peritoneal cavity contained a large amount (10-12 l) ofturbid serosanguineous fluid and fibrous ingesta. Theperitoneum, diffuselyreddened, with extensively widespread petechial andecchymotic haemorrhages. The stomach had a 17 \u00d713 defect, with transmural haemorrhagic margins at The The descending duodenum was markedly dilated (17-21 cm diameter) and abruptly narrowed (8 cm diameter)50 cm aboral to the pyloric sphincter , near the caudalflexure at the base of the caecum. The mucosa of thedilated segment of duodenum was diffusely oedematousand dark red to purple (congestion and/or haemorrhage). The corresponding serosa was mildly haemorrhagic.Approximately 30 cm aboral to the pyloric sphincter , cmregion of clearly demarcated, toecchymotic haemorrhages was present on the duodenalserosa ( Fig 1 ). At the site of narrowing, a 5 cm segment of the duodenal wall was transmurally pale tan (blanching due toprior volvulus). The mesoduodenum adjacent the affectedsegment duodenum was intact but diffusely elongated(25 cm long) ( Fig 2 ). Focally there was a 1.5 cm wide \u00d70.5 cm thick band of adipose tissue, confluent with the adipose tissueof the mesoduodenum, extending 10 cm across theantimesenteric surface of the duodenal serosa ( Fig 3 ). Histopathological changes were consistent with necrosis of the duodenum and congestion of the mesoduodenalvasculature secondary to volvulus formation. Discussion The equine duodenum is relatively short, only approximately1 m long, and is tethered in constant position by attachmentof the mesoduodenum to the dorsal body wall (Dyce et al . 2002). V olvulus in the horse typically requires sufficiently mobilemesentery, such as occurs with the large colon or segments ofthe jejunum.

Fig 2: Elongated mesoduodenum. \u00a9 2015 / FEBRUARY 2015Duodenal volvulus has not been previously reported in the horse, although it has been observed in Holstein cattle (V ogelet al . 2012) and Green ( Chelonia mydas ) (Hasbun et al . 1998). Prognosis for the former population was promising (22/29 patients survived to discharge) presumably due to thedifference in attachments of the sigmoid flexure to themesoduodenum as well as the greater and lesser omentum. AllGreen Sea Turtles were diagnosed on necropsy, and volvuluswas hypothesised to be secondary to changes in watertemperature, which enhanced over-fermentation of ingestedsea grass, and liberation of excess gas (Hasbun et al . 1998). Duodenal volvulus in man is most often reported with infants in conjunction with volvulus of the entire midgut and/orthe presence of peritoneal bands. However , spontaneousduodenal volvulus in an 85-year-old woman was al (2007). Duodenal volvulus without midgut malrotation was suspected based on contrast enhancedcomputed and was confirmedwith of the mesoduodenum (Roux et al . 2007). Movement of the duodenum due to mesoduodenal laxityin clinically asymptomatic/normal people has beendocumented by Friedman (1946) and was noted particularly infifth and sixth decades of life. Midgut malrotation has beenreported as a cause of simple bowel obstruction in adulthuman patients (Emanuwa et al . 2011). Although the incidence was reported as low at 0.2% at the time ofpublication, diagnosis of this condition may become morefrequent with the utilisation of enhanced CT imaging. It isinteresting that this horse had what could be described asmesoduodenal laxity, a band extending hemicircumferentiallyaround the duodenum to the antimesenteric border , andduodenal volvulus. The gold standard for diagnosis in man, contrast- enhanced computed tomography, is not available in horses,but abdominal sonography may have provided informationregarding the distension of the duodenum and normal jejunaland ileal diameter. With respect to diagnosing gastric rupture,certainly both sonographic evaluation and abdominocentesiswould have been helpful and likely to preclude the need forsurgery. Clinical findings on initial physical examination wereconsistent with gastrointestinal rupture, and these additionaldiagnostics could have been confirmatory (Pratt et al . 2003). The therapeutic course was influenced by the inability tocontact the owner , value of the horse, and the instructions the farm manager initially received upon accepting the role ofagent in her singular contact with the owner. The horse described here presented with secondary rupture, but earlier intervention and diagnosis could haveresulted in possible surgical treatment. Surgical options mayhave included mesoduodenal tacking to the Zedler et al 2009). Although the pathophysiology of this horse's duodenal volvulus is unknown, we hypothesise that the gelding mayhave been predisposed to duodenal malposition due to the mesoduodenum and accumulation ofingesta 1946; Roux et al . 2007). The mesoduodenal elongation may have been a sequela of chronic partialoutflow obstruction caused by the band of mesoduodenumassociated with the antimesenteric surface of the duodenalserosa, similar in appearance to a mesodiverticular band(Freeman 1982). It would seem that the combination ofelongated mesoduodenum and accumulation of ingestaprobably precipitated volvulus formation. Duodenal volvulus should be considered as an unusual cause of secondary or idiopathic gastric rupture. Carefulevaluation of the duodenum should be an importantcomponent of an exploratory celiotomy in which gastricdistension is present, and no other cause of obstruction can beidentified.

L. Southwood Clinical Studies, University of Pennsylvania, Kennett Square, USA. Corresponding author email: southwoo@vet.upenn.edu Summary It is fortunate for the horse that duodenal lesions requiring surgical correction occur infrequently. Despite being anuncommon site of obstruction, palpation of the duodenumshould be part of a complete surgical abdominal exploration.Horses with proximal obstruction typically have large volumesof reflux following passage of a nasogastric tube. Biochemistryabnormalities may include hypochloraemia andhyperglycaemia particularly with a complete or strangulatingobstruction. Early surgical treatment of a duodenal volvulusmay result in a favourable outcome. Duodenal lesions requiring surgical correction are uncommon in horses, which is fortunate due to the relatively poor surgicalaccessibility. While it would have had no impact on outcomein this instance, one take-home message from the casedescribed by Wulster and Dallap Schaer (2015) is theimportance of performing a complete abdominal explorationon horses presenting for colic. Complete abdominalexploration should include duodenal palpation from thepylorus to the duodenocolic ligament ( Figs 1 and 2). The duodenum can be divided into 4 parts: cranial (superior in man), descending, transverse (or inferior in man)and ascending. The cranial part begins at the pylorus justto the right of midline in the to the cranial (superior flexure in man). Thecranial part of the duodenum is attached to the liver viathe hepatoduodenal ligament of the lesser omentum. sigmoid ansa in the right cranial dorsalabdomen (Freeman 2006). The major (bile and pancreaticduct opening) and minor (accessory pancreatic ductopening) papillae are located in the duodenal ampulla. Theduodenum then courses along the right side of the abdomento the caudal flexure (inferior flexure in man) near the caecalbase. The duodenum then courses around the base of thecaecum transversely from right to left and then slightly cranially(ascends) toward the duodenal colic ligament, whichattaches the duodenum to the transverse colon (Epstein andFehr 2013). The duodenocolic ligament creates theduodenojejunal flexure, at which point the duodenumcontinues as the jejunum. The duodenum cannot beexteriorised or seen through a ventral midline celiotomybecause of its short mesenteric attachments to the dorsalbody wall. It is easiest to palpate by commencing at theduodenocolic ligament (once the jejunum has beenexteriorised) with the surgeon moving their hand orad alongthe duodenum toward the caudal flexure. Once this section isexamined, the surgeon can identify the pylorus in the cranialabdomen and then move their hand aborad to palpate thecranial flexure, the descending duodenum, and the The of the duodenum should be palpated forstenosis, thickening, intramural or adjacent masses causing obstruction and, in light of the current report, volvulus. Proximal obstructions (i.e. obstructions involving the pylorus, duodenum, or proximal jejunum) are typicallyassociated with a very large volume of reflux early during thecourse of the disease. The reason for the absence of reflux bythe referring veterinarian in the case reported by Wulster andDallap Schaer (2015) may be that the nasogastric tube wasnot completely through the cardia or because gastric rupturemay have already occurred. Reflux may be obtainedfollowing nasogastric intubation even following gastric rupture.When the stomach is severely distended, it can be challengingto pass the tube through the cardia and into the stomach,possibly because the cardia becomes kinked or the cardiacsphincter spasms. Using topical lidocaine, passage of adifferent sized nasogastric tube (although a smaller tube maybe more likely to kink at the cardia) and being patient byallowing the horse to rest and re-trying may help. The horse in the report showed classic signs of viscus perforation upon arrival at the referral hospital, namely dulldemeanour , sweating, muscle fasciculations and markedtachypnoea with nostril flare. Horses are also often reluctant towalk, may have abdominal distension and are often febrile.The abrasions to the tuber coxae and face are typical of horses that have been showing signs of severe pain at somepoint and usually indicate a surgical (often strangulating)lesion. In addition to the gritty texture of the serosal surfacespalpated per rectum , the rectal wall is often appreciated to be collapsed around the arm and may be in conjunction witha floating sensation associated with a loss of negativeintraperitoneal pressure. These clinical features, particularlywith severe signs of shock, a lack of typical colic signs, inconjunction with severe leucopenia point towardgastrointestinal perforation. One of the main differentialdiagnoses in these patients is severe colitis. Differentiationbetween severe colitis and septic peritonitis associated withperforation can be accomplished with abdominalsonographic evaluation, abdominocentesis cytology ofthe peritoneal fluid, and exploratory laparotomy. Peritonealfluid nucleated cell count and protein concentration is oftennot useful because of dilution and the cells are often lysed.Cytology typically reveals intracellular bacteria. Regardless ofthe reason, horses presenting with signs of shock and sepsis assevere as the horse in this case report (i.e. heart rate 80-100beats/min, blood lactate concentration 15.3 mmol/l, andpacked cell volume of 58% with a total plasma protein of58 g/l), have a poor prognosis for survival. Unlessgastrointestinal viscus perforation can be confirmed, however ,exploratory celiotomy is recommended. Duodenal volvulus is an uncommon cause of an acute abdomen in any species because of the normally shortmesenteric attachment to the body wall. However , duodenalsigmoid flexure volvulus (DSFV) has recently been reported \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015an emerging disease in dairy cattle (V ogel et al . 2012; Russell 2013). Cattle are somewhat unique with a longermesoduodenum compared to other species. So what can welearn about this type of lesion from cattle? The majority ofaffected cattle had undergone an omentopexy or pylorpexyprocedure between one day and 2 years prior to occurrenceof the volvulus. The pexy procedure may increase the mobilityof the duodenum by reducing the tension created by thenormally ventrally located abomasum. The reduced tensioncould allow the duodenum to displace dorsally, which isthought to be the initial displacement that ultimately led to avolvulus (V ogel et al . 2012). Duodenal ulceration and plasma electrolyte abnormalities altering intestinal motility were alsoconsidered contributing factors in cattle (V ogel et al . 2012).The horse in the report of this issue of EVE had a volvulus in the caudal part of the descending duodenum associated with along mesoduodenum and an adhesion or band of mesenteryattaching to the antimesenteric border of the duodenum. Theduodenum was also reported to become abruptly narrow atthe level of the caudal flexure with the portion of theduodenum orad to this being markedly dilated (up to 21 cmdiameter). It warrants speculation if the horse had a morechronic partial obstruction and any history of recurrent colic.Regardless, as may be the case in cattle, the anatomicaberrations probably contributed to the volvulus in this horse. Duodenal sigmoid flexure volvulus in dairy cattle and the closely related gall bladder displacement syndrome (Russell2013) have only been observed in the past 5-7 years. V ogelet al . (2012) hypothesised that breeding for larger , taller dairy cattle may lead to a more mobile duodenum predisposingthem to a DSFV. Breed differences in the length of themesoduodenum in horses have not been investigated. Cattlewith DSFV typically have a hypochloraemic metabolicalkalosis associated with sequestration of hydrochloric acid inthe well as biochemistry changes consistentwith cholestasis and hepatocellular damage. Horses with smallintestinal a hypochloraemia (e.g.88-91 mEq/l, reference range 94-102 mEq/l) although not asmarked as that observed in cattle (often 70 mEq/l, reference range 96-109 mEq/l) (V ogel et al . 2012). Clinical pathology changes associated with the hepatobiliary system are alsoobserved very commonly in horses with colic (Underwoodet al . 2010). A combination of hyperglycaemia mmol/l]) or without a metabolic alkalosis should raise concern about a small intestinal strangulating obstruction in ahorse presenting with signs of colic. Cattle with DSFV had a good prognosis for survival (V ogel et al . 2012). Not surprisingly, survival decreased with increasing duration of clinical signs - 15/16 cattle with clinical signs <1 day duration survived vs. 2/4 cattle with clinical signs >3 days duration survived. No attempts were made to pexy thesigmoid flexure and no recurrence was reported. Early surgicalintervention in a horse with duodenal volvulus may result in afavourable outcome.

Ltd64 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015Case Report Deep digital flexor tendon rupture in two horses: A potential complication of comminuted second phalangeal fractures Y. A. Elceand L. Goodrich* Faculty of V eterinary Medicine, University of Montreal, St Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada; andV eterinary Teaching Hospital, Colorado State Collins, second phalanx Summary This case report describes the history, clinical findings, treatment and outcome of 2 horses with damage and eventualrupture of the deep digital flexor tendon as a result of acomminuted second phalangeal fracture. The rupture of thedeep digital flexor tendon complicated the treatment and inone horse contributed to its eventual euthanasia. The athleticoutcome was limited in the second case and the lack ofpalmar soft tissue support likely had a significant effect on thestability and biomechanics of the repair. Introduction Fractures of the second phalanx (P2) have been described inhorses and have a variety of configurations. Fractures caninclude one or both palmar or plantar processes, the proximalinterphalangeal joint, with or without the distal interphalangealjoint, and can have varying degrees of comminution.Comminuted second phalangeal fractures and theirtreatment have been previously described in the literature(Doran et al . 1987; Crabill 2006; Lescun et al . 2007). These injuries often occur as a result of trauma and have been reported frequently in breeds such as QuarterHorses who perform fast tight turns during their exercise or afterpaddock turnout. Due to the thick fascia surrounding thepastern, the fractures are commonly closed and internalfixation is the treatment of choice. For a comminuted fracture2 dorsally located plates with screws are used to perform anarthrodesis of the pastern joint. The palmar or plantareminences should be included to reconstruct the tensionband at the palmar or plantar surface and displacement atthe distal interphalangeal joint minimised. If reconstructionusing plates and screws is not an option due to the nature ofthe fracture then a transfixation pin cast can be used as theprimary method of repair , or as an adjunctive stabilisation toseverely comminuted fractures repaired with 1 or 2 plates. Theprognosis for survival after a comminuted fracture of the P2 isgood while the return to athletic endeavour may depend onthe involvement of the coffin joint. The first small series of P2fractures repaired with internal fixation was described in 1987with 6/7 horses surviving (Doran et al . 1987). Following this report, a series of 10 horses with comminuted P2 fractures withdouble plate fixation and pastern arthrodeses were describedwith all cases surviving (Crabill et al . 1995). Two large case series have been published regarding the use of transfixationcasts to treat comminuted P2 fractures as well as firstphalangeal (P1) and metacarpal fractures (Joyce et al . 2006; Lescun et al . 2007). Both articles report a good success rate for survival with an overall 70% survival in phalangeal fracturesincluding 14 P2 fractures (Joyce et al . 2006) and 75% survival of P2 fractures in 8 cases (Lescun et al . 2007). There are no large series of horses with P2 fractures that enable any firmconclusion to be drawn regarding return to athletic usealthough factors such as the degree of involvement of thedistal interphalangeal joint have reasonably been assumed todecrease the prognosis. It is also logical that the trauma andinvolvement of palmar or plantar soft tissues will have an effecton the prognosis. No specific studies have examined theimplication of soft tissue structures in these fractures. This casereport details 2 cases of comminuted hindlimb P2 fractures inwhich the fracture fragments and subsequent to laceration/rupture of the deep digital flexor tendonand palmar support structures. The 2 cases highlight theimportance of assessment of soft tissues in fracture repair ,specifically P2 fractures. Horse 1 History A 13-year-old Hanoverian mare presented with anonweightbearing lameness of the right hindlimb.

The mare hadbeen placed in a distal limb cast for transport but upon arrivalthe cast was found to be broken. Clinical examination Radiographs revealed a severely comminuted fracture of themiddle phalanx with displacement of the proximal phalanxdistally and plantarly into the region of intact medial strut was identified ( ). Surgery for fracture fixation with pastern arthrodesis was scheduled for thefollowing day and a Kimsey 1splint over a bandage was applied for the night. Surgery Horse 1 was anaesthetised for surgery the day after admission. Preoperative intravenous (i.v.) andantibiotics were administered and a epidural was placed. A regional limb perfusion with antibioticswas performed prior to the start of surgery. An inverted Tincision was made in the skin dorsally over the pastern with thebase of the inverted T being located approximately 1.5 cmproximal to the coronary band. This was followed by aninverted V incision in the long digital extensor tendon whichwas used to / AE / FEBRUARY 2015osteostixis of distal P1 was performed to promote access ofosteogenic elements from the trabecular space and ingrowthof blood vessels across the bone plate . A 4 hole narrow dynamic compression plate (DCP) 3was placed along the medial dorsal aspect of P1 P2 with the distal hole beinglocated in proximal P2. Both 4.5 mm and 5.5 mm cortical bonescrews 3were used. One additional bone screw was placed just distal and lateral to the plate in lag fashion through P2fragments. Due to the extensive comminution no fixation wasplaced laterally. Bone marrow was harvested at the time ofsurgery from the tuber coxae and placed as a bone graft in the fracture and articulation lateral to the plate. Antibioticimpregnated polymethylmethacrylate beads were placedbeside the plate. The incision was closed with size 0polyglyconate (Maxon) 4in a horizontal mattress pattern for the extensor tendon and size 0 polypropylene (Prolene)5for the skin in a vertical mattress pattern. A transfixation pin castwas placed to protect the severely comminuted fracture. Two6.35 mm positive profile pins (IMEX) 6were placed in the distal cannon bone and a fibreglass cast applied incorporating thepins ( Fig 2 ).Horse 1 recovered from anaesthesia without incident. Intravenous antibiotics and analgesics werecontinued for 7 days and oral antibiotics were thenadministered. Several morphine epidurals were giventhroughout the first several days post operatively. Case progression The immediate post operative period passed without incidentbut 5 weeks into the post operative period digital pulsesincreased on the contralateral limb and there was someincreased weight shifting observed. Radiographs of thepastern joint were taken and no abnormalities were seen. The cast was changed and the transfixation pins removed. Mildswelling was found above the cast and in the contralaterallimb. Ten days after the cast change the horse was againpainful on the right hindlimb and epidural analgesia was givenrepeatedly to help alleviate pain. Radiographs revealedcontinued healing of the fracture in the right hind butincreasing evidence of rotation of the third phalanx in the lefthindlimb indicative of support limb laminitis. A cast sore haddeveloped on the dorsal proximal aspect of the cannon boneso the cast was removed and a bandage cast applied.Weight shifting and discomfort continued for the next 3 weeks.At 9 weeks post operatively the bandage cast was bivalvedand eventually replaced by a splint; however , she failed toregain her original level of comfort. An ultrasound of the limbwas performed at 9 weeks during the transition to the bivalvedcast and splint as the fetlock was noted to be sinking and thetoe elevated upon weightbearing. Extensive fibre loss ( >80%) of the deep tendon (DDFT) in the region of thedistal pastern was noted. A variety of intensive painmanagement techniques were used during this periodincluding an epidural catheter , fentanyl patches (Duragesic) 7, systemic anti-inflammatories, digital support systems and finallya high 4-point alcohol block on the fractured limb to improvecomfort and relieve the complete weightbearing beingplaced upon the contralateral support limb that had supportlimb laminitis. Around 3 months post operatively radiographswere taken and revealed severe right hind distalinterphalangeal joint subluxation indicative of complete DDFTrupture and separation of the coronary band ( Fig 3 ). The laminitis in the left hind foot had also progressed. Given thesefindings this horse was subjected to euthanasia and anecropsy performed. In addition to the healing comminuted middle phalangeal fracture in the right hind, necropsy revealed a completerupture of the DDFT at the level of insertion of the distal phalanxas well as extensive fibre tearing of the DDFT in the pasternregion extending up into the mid-metatarsal region. There waspartial ischaemic necrosis of the coronary tosevere distal interphalangeal joint luxation. Laminitis and P3rotation were present in the left hind foot. Horse 2 History A 13-year-old mixed breed police horse gelding waspresented to the hospital for a nonweightbearing lameness ofthe left hindlimb following turnout. The horse had beenshipped to the hospital in a Kimsey 1splint due to suspicion of a P2 fracture given the history, palpation and degree oflameness. Clinical examination The Kimsey1was removed and radiographs taken on admission revealed a highly comminuted displaced middlephalangeal fracture that involved the proximalinterphalangeal joint but not the distal interphalangeal joint.There was plantar displacement of the distal aspect of theproximal phalanx ( Fig 4 ). The horse was placed in a Kimsey 1 splint and surgery scheduled for the next day. Surgery The following day a morphine (Astramorph)2epidural was given as part of the intraoperative pain management, i.v. Fig 1: A lateromedial radiographic view of the pastern of Horse 1 on admission to the hospital. A large fragment can be seen displacedin a plantar direction in the region of the deep digital flexor tendonas well as distal-plantar displacement of P1. \u00a9 2014 Ltd66 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015antibiotics and anti-inflammatories were administered and the horse placed under general anaesthesia. An abaxialsesamoid block with 6 ml of 2% mepivicaine (Carbocaine) 8 was placed. A similar approach to Horse 1 was used to expose the pastern joint and prepare the joint surfaces for thearthrodesis. The fracture repair utilised two 4 hole narrow DCPsand one central cortical bone screw placed in lag fashion inproximal P2 to engage the plantar fragments. A combinationof 5.5 mm and 4.5 mm cortical bone screws was used ( Fig 5 ). The tendon was sutured using No. 0 polyglactin 910(Vicryl) 5in a horizontal mattress pattern and the skin sutured in a vertical mattress pattern using No. 0 nylon (Ethilon)5. A distal limb cast was placed with slight heel elevation for the recoveryand first month post operatively. Horse 2 recovered well from surgery and began bearing weight on the affected limb theday following surgery. He was given i.v. anti-inflammatoriesand antibiotics for 5 days following surgery. A Soft-Ride boot 9 was placed on his support limb to equalise limb length.Radiographs taken the day following surgery confirmed theplacement of the internal fixation for the comminuted fractureof P2 and the arthrodesis of the proximal interphalangeal was noted that one lateral plantar fragment was notsuccessfully engaged in the distal screws and there wascontinued displacement of this large fragment on theplantarolateral aspect of P2. Case progression At the one month cast removal the toe was observed toelevate during weightbearing and an ultrasound examinationrevealed a complete laceration of the DDFT at the level of thepastern joint. A distal limb cast was reapplied for a secondmonth. At 2 months after surgery this cast was removed and ashoe with an aggressive heel extension and elevation wasplaced ( Fig 6 ). The horse was maintained in this shoe for the following 3 months with a slowly decreasing amount of heelelevation and extension. Throughout this time the horse wasmaintained on stall rest. Radiographs were taken monthly toevaluate the progression of the fracture healing and lateralradiographs were taken of the opposite hind foot to monitorfor laminitis. No clinical or radiographic signs of laminitis Fig 2: A lateral and dorsoplantar post operative radiograph of thepastern of Horse 1 .

Six months after surgery thehorse was in a normal shoe and had begun handwalking asradiographs revealed sufficient healing of the arthrodesisdespite excessive callus formation and implant breakage (Fig 7 ). The horse returned to work 9 months after surgery as a police horse. He continued to work for approximately 2 yearsand was subsequently retired to pasture. He reportedlydisplayed a mild lameness ( grade 2/5 ) with long work on hard road surfaces but was comfortable at pasture.

Fig 7: A dorsoplantar radiograph of the pastern of Horse 2 at 5 months post operatively showing the excessive fracture callus andimplant breakage. \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd68 AE / FEBRUARY 2015Discussion Initial radiographic examination in both cases revealed a bony fragment within the region of the DDFT and significant tension inthe plantar pastern area when weightbearing occurred. It canbe reasonably concluded that the DDFT laceration was presentat the time of the initial injury ( Figs 1 and 4). In neither case was this recognised as horses were supported in casts or Kimseysplints before and after surgery and the focus was on thefracture. Another indication of the degree of disruption of theplantar soft tissues was evident on retrospective evaluation ofthe preoperative radiographs with the marked distal andplantar displacement of P1. Careful evaluation of the postoperative radiograph of Horse 2 also revealed subtle signs of instability in the distal interphalangeal joint which could later beattributed to the rupture of the DDFT (revealed when the castwas removed). After this horse was removed from the cast 2months after surgery he would intermittently catch his foot andflip the toe up, even with the extended and elevated shoe. Acombination of this action, the loss of the DDFT plantar supportand failure to fully engage both plantar fragments in the repairlikely contributed to the eventual failure of one plate andseveral screws. He developed an excessive fracture callus dueto the instability at the pastern joint ( Fig 7 ). Fortunately, the horse remained comfortable without lameness in the stall andduring hand walking as the fracture healed and did notdevelop support limb laminitis. He also developed sufficientfibrosis at the site of DDFT rupture and was able to return to hiswork as a police horse. However , the rupture of the DDFT was notrecognised until the removal of the first cast and this factsignificantly prolonged his recovery. The aftercare was longand involved longer cast immobilisation, specialised farriercare, longer stall rest and frequent monitoring andradiographic examinations. If the fractures had been carefully evaluated for the fragment displacement and possible soft tissue trauma, thelacerations of the plantar soft tissues could have beenrecognised before surgery and included in the discussion withthe owners. An ultrasound examination in both casesdemonstrated the damage to the DDFT after surgery whenremoval of external coaptation revealed instability of thelimbs. In Horse 1 at 9 weeks after surgery the fetlock would sink and the toe elevate and ultrasound revealed extensive fibreloss of the DDFT in the pastern region. Complete rupture wasapparent soon after with the subluxation of the distalinterphalangeal joint and is likely attributable to the increasedstress once the coaptation was completely removed. In Horse 2the toe would elevate with weightbearing at one month after surgery and ultrasound revealed complete rupture of theDDFT in the pastern region. Ultrasound of the limbs beforesurgery may have been difficult with the horse standing as thegoal in both cases was to prevent weightbearing withoutexternal coaptation to minimise further bony trauma.However , with the radiographic evidence of fragmentdisplacement and P1 displacement, ultrasound could havebeen performed under anaesthesia before surgery.Alternatively, in depth examination of the fractures could havebeen enhanced by the use of a computed tomography (CT)scan before surgery. This has previously been shown to allowimproved visualisation of fracture configuration and guideappropriate treatment of P2 fractures (Rose et al . 1997). Evaluation of the soft tissues, in particular the deep digitalflexor tendon, has been investigated using contrast enhancedCT scan which would have been useful in the 2 cases described here (V an Hamel et al . 2014). While MRI has been used for imaging of equine soft tissues, the time required toobtain images is longer than a CT scan which is an importantconsideration when a fracture repair is scheduled during thesame anaesthetic period. These 2 cases focus on the damage and eventual rupture inHorse 1 and rupture in Horse 2 of the DDFT but certainly the straight distal sesamoidean ligaments and other plantar softtissue support structures would have also been involved. It wasnot possible to evaluate the sesamoidean ligaments onultrasound examination due to the disruption of the DDFT , softtissue swelling and in both cases the desire for a quickexamination so coaptation could be replaced. Regardless ofwhether or not the distal sesamoidean ligaments were intact,the fact that the incorporation of the plantar P2 eminenceswas not totally completed in either case due to severecomminution and fragment displacement would havecontributed to the strain on both the remaining plantar softtissues and potential progression to rupture of the DDFT in Case 1and cyclic fatigue of the implants in Case 2 . Certainly the rupture of the deep digital flexor tendon would diminish the prognosis for return to athletic activity. Additionally,the lack of palmar or plantar support loads the dorsal plates incompression. This would have contributed to the cyclic fatigueand implant breakage seen in the second case. The fact thatone large plantar process was not incorporated into the repairin the second case would have contributed to this instability butcertainly the lack of the DDFT exacerbated the problem. Theimplant breakage and instability resulted in a very large bonycallus. While not specifically examined in this case, the largecallus could contribute to soft tissue involvement andmechanical lameness. In the first case the damage to the DDFTmay have contributed to pain that caused the support limblaminitis. This pain could have been derived from eitherinstability at the fracture site and eventually from the resultantdistal interphalangeal joint luxation when the tendon rupturedcompletely after coaptation removal. The post mortem examination revealed both severe inflammation andadhesions of the soft tissues in the plantar pastern andischaemic necrosis of the coronary band secondary to theluxation. These 2 cases demonstrate the potential for DDFT injury with P2 fractures and reveal the importance of assessment ofpalmar/plantar soft tissue injury preoperatively. Surgeonsshould not neglect the evaluation of the supporting soft tissuestructures when looking at radiographs of fractures.Recognition of marked palmar or plantar displacement ofsharp fracture fragments and the first phalanx should promptfurther investigation in the form of ultrasound or contrastenhanced CT scan before surgery. The prolonged aftercareand diminished prognosis for athleticism can then bediscussed with owners.

ADVERSE REACTIONS There were no adverse effects noted in the fi eld study which could be ascribed to diclazuril. To report suspected adverse react ions, to obtain a MSDS, or for technical assistance call 1-800-224-5318 . CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The effectiveness of diclazuril in inhibiting merozoite production of Sarcocystis neurona and S. falcatula in bovine turbinate cell cultures was studied by Lindsay and Dubey (2000).1 Diclazuril inhibited merozoite production by more than 80% in cultures of S. neurona or S. falcatula treated with 0.1 ng/mL diclazuril and greater than 95% inhibition of merozoite production (IC 95) was observed when infected cultures were treated with 1.0 ng/mL diclazuril. The clinical relevance of the in vitro cell culture dat a has not been determined. PHARMACOKINETICS IN THE HORSE The oral bioavailability of diclazuril from the PROTAZIL\u00ae (1.56% diclazuril) Antiprotozoal Pellets at a 5 mg/kg dose rate is approximately 5%. Related diclazuril concentrations in the cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) range between 1% and 5% of the concentrations observed in the plasma. Nevertheless, based upon equine pilot study data, CSF concentrations are expected to substantially exceed the in vitro IC 95 estimates for merozoite production (Dirikolu et al., 1999)2. Due to its long terminal elimination half-life in horses (approximately 43-65 hours), diclazuril accumulation occurs with once-daily dosing. Corresponding steady state blood levels are achieved by approximately Da y 10 of administration. EFFECTIVENESS Two hundred and fourteen mares, stallions, and geldings of various breeds, ranging in age from 9.6 months to 30 years, were enr olled in a multi-center fi eld study. All horses were confi rmed EPM-positive based on the results of clinical examin ations and laboratory testing, including CSF Western Blot analyse s. Horses were administered PROTAZIL\u00ae (1.56% diclazuril) Antiprotozoal Pellets at doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg diclazuril/kg body weight as a top-dress on their daily grain rati on for 28 days. The horses were then evaluated for clinical changes via a modifi ed Mayhew neurological scale on Day 48 as follows: 0. Normal, neurological defi cits not detected.1. Neurological defi cits may be detectable at normal gaits; signs exacerbated with manipulative procedures (e.g., backing, turn ing in tight circles, walking with head elevation, truncal swaying, etc.). 2. Neurological defi cit obvious at normal gaits or posture; signs exacerbated with manipulative procedures.3. Neurological defi cit very prominent at normal gaits: horses give the impression they may fall (but do not) and buckle or fal l with manipulative procedures. 4. Neurological defi cit is profound at normal gait: horse frequently stumbles or trips and may fall at normal gaits or when man ipulative procedures were utilized. 5. Horse is recumbent, unable to rise. Each horse's response to treatment was compared to its pre-treatment values. Successful response to treatment was defi ned as cl inical improvement of at least one grade by Day 48 \u00b1 conversion of CSF to Western Blot-negative status for S. neurona or achievement of Western Blot-negative CSF status without imp rovement of 1 ataxia grade. Forty-two horses were initially evaluated for effectiveness and 214 horses were evaluated for safety. Clinical condition was ev aluated by the clinical investigator's subjective scoring and then corroborated by evaluation of the neurological examination videotapes by a masked panel of three equine veterinarians. Alt hough 42 horses were evaluated for clinical effectiveness, corroboration of clinical effectiveness via videotape evaluation was not possible for one horse due to missing neurologic exami nation videotapes. Therefore, this horse was not included in the success rate calculation.Based on the numbers of horses that seroconverted to negative Western Blot status, and the numbers of horses classifi ed as succ esses by the clinical investigators, 28 of 42 horses (67%) at 1 mg/kg were considered successes. With regard to independent expert masked videotape assessments, 10 of 24 horses (42%) at 1 mg/kg were considered successes. There was no clinical difference in effectiveness among the 1, 5, a nd 10 mg/kg treatment group results. Adverse events were reported for two of the 214 horses evaluated for safety. In the fi rst case, a horse was enrolled showing se vere neurologic signs. Within 24 hours of dosing, the horse was recumbent, biting, and exhibiting signs of dementia. The horse died, and no cause of death was determined. In the second ca se, the horse began walking stiffl y approximately 13 days after the start of dosing. The referring veterinarian reported that the horse had been fed grass clippings and possibly ha d laminitis. ANIMAL SAFETY PROTAZIL \u00ae (1.56% diclazuril) Antiprotozoal Pellets were administered to 30 horses (15 males and 15 females, ranging from 5 to 9 months o f age) in a target animal safety study. Five groups of 6 horses each (3 males and 3 females) received 0, 5 (5X), 15 (15X), 25 (25X) or 50 (50X) mg diclazuril/kg (2.27mg/lb) body weight/day for 42 consecutive days as a top-dress on the grain ration of the horse. The variables measured during the study included: clinical and physical observations, body we ights, food and water consumption, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, fecal analysis, necropsy, organ weights, gross and histopathologic examinations. The safety of diclazuri l top-dress administered to horses at 1 mg/kg once daily cannot be determined based solely on this study because of the lack of an adequate control group (control horses tested positiv e for the test drug in plasma and CSF). However, possible fi ndings associated with the drug were limited to elevations in BUN, creatinine, and SDH and less than anticipated weight gain. Defi nitive test article-related effects were decreased grain/ top-dress consumption in horses in the 50 mg/kg group.In a second target animal safety study, PROTAZIL\u00ae (1.56% diclazuril) Antiprotozoal Pellets were administered to 24 horses (12 males and 12 females, ranging from 2 to 8 years of age). Three groups of 4 horses/sex/group received 0, 1, or 5 mg diclazuril/kg body weight/day for 42 days as a top-dress on the grain ration of the horse. The variables measured during the study included physical examinations, body weights, food and water consumption, hematology, and serum chemistry. There were no test article-related fi ndings seen during the study.

B. Lescun Department of V eterinary Clinical Sciences, College of V eterinary Medicine, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.Corresponding author email: tlescun@purdue.edu Summary The case report by Elce and Goodrich in the current issue highlights 3 aspects of fracture management related to the softtissues. The soft tissues are not always easily and completelyassessed at initial fracture evaluation, and can be a source ofongoing pain, dysfunction and treatment failure even followingsuccessful fracture healing, and will be a vital componentof the structural stability of some fracture repairs. Thiscommentary explores these 3 aspects of fracturemanagement in the horse. The case report by Elce and Goodrich (2015), describing damage and rupture of the deep digital flexor tendonassociated with comminuted second phalangeal fracture in 2horses, highlights 3 aspects of fracture management in thehorse related to the soft tissues involved: first, the soft tissuescan be a vital component of the overall stability and functionof a particular bone, joint or body region; second, concurrentsoft tissue injuries can be a source of ongoing pain anddysfunction, in spite of fracture healing, and at times will be acause of treatment failure; and third, complete assessment ofsoft tissue involvement can be challenging at best and attimes impossible during initial fracture assessment. Soft tissueinjuries associated with fracture can result in a variety ofcomplications, including ischaemia/necrosis, severehaemorrhage or nerve dysfunction as a result of neurovasculardamage, ongoing lameness with or without instability as aresult of tendon or ligament injury, restrictive fibrosis as a resultof severe muscle injury, and osteomyelitis as a result of skin andperiosteal damage at the fracture site. Soft tissue instability In the report by Elce and Goodrich (2015), comminutedsecond phalanx fractures were treated with a combination ofdorsomedial plate fixation and transfixation pin cast in Horse 1 and double plate fixation in Horse 2 . As the authors state in the report, single plate, double plate and transfixation pin castconstructs have all been successful in the treatment of secondphalanx fractures in the horse (Doran et al . 1987; 2006; Lescun et al . 2007). The authors assessed that the severe comminution present on the lateralside of the second phalanx in Horse 1 did not allow use of a second dorsal plate, as would be preferred, and chose tosupport the fixation with a transfixation pin cast. Dorsal platingrelies on the tension band provided by intact palmar/plantarsoft tissues of the pastern joint to maintain stability in this type ofconstruct. The dorsal surface of the pastern is primarily undercompression during weightbearing and this will be amplifiedwithout the palmar/plantar tension band of the soft tissues.Reconstruction of the palmar/plantar eminences of thesecond phalanx is a goal of fracture repair and arthrodesis ofthe pastern joint because of this requirement for the stability ofthe soft tissues to complement the dorsal plate fixation. The relative contribution that the deep digital flexor tendonprovides in this context is not known, but it is reasonable toargue, as the authors do, that loss of deep digital flexor tendonintegrity may have contributed to the hardware failureobserved in Horse 2 . Rupture of the straight sesamoidean ligament with subluxation of the pastern joint provides a similarchallenge in maintaining construct stability in the pastern.Arthrodesis of the pastern joint is utilised for treatment of thisinjury, but can be challenging as part of the soft tissue tensionband support is lost, even when the palmar/plantareminences are incorporated in the arthrodesis construct andthe deep digital flexor tendon is intact. Figure 1 shows lateral radiographs of the left front pastern of a horse with a rupturedstraight sesamoidean ligament (confirmed on ultrasound)treated using double plate fixation. The implants failed overtime despite eventual arthrodesis of the pastern joint, healingof the ligament and survival of the horse. Figure 2a shows the appearance of the digit at presentation while Figure 2b shows the appearance of the digit at 4 months post injury. Heelelevation was used to help support the palmar structures of thedigit during healing. Damage to the deep digital flexor tendon has been recognised in other fractures reported in the horse. Russell andHall reported damage to the deep digital flexor tendonassociated with an axial fracture of the proximal sesamoidbone concurrent with a lateral metatarsal condylar fracture(Russell and Hall 2011). Insidious damage to the tendonresulted in ongoing severe lameness and eventual euthanasiain this case. Hoegaerts et al . (2005) recognised a distal sesamoid bone fracture associated with a horse presentingwith signs of rupture of the deep digital flexor tendon in aforelimb. It was speculated that the fracture was the result ofdegenerative changes associated with the distal sesamoidbone and that rupture of the deep digital flexor tendon wasalso likely to be a part of the degenerative condition in thishorse. Most recently, Minshall and Wright (2014) recogniseddamage to the deep digital flexor tendon within the carpalsheath associated with frontal plane fractures of the accessorycarpal bone. These injuries were identified using acombination of ultrasonography and tenoscopy of the carpalsheath, with a successful outcome in the cases in whichtenoscopic debridement of the damaged tendon wasemployed. Soft tissue pain, dysfunction andtreatment failure In the report by Elce and Goodrich (2015), despite satisfactory reduction and protection of the fracture repair using atransfixation pin cast in Horse 1 , development of support limb laminitis became apparent at 5 weeks post injury. Ongoingpain from support limb laminitis may have contributed to71 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015additional strain on the deep digital flexor tendon and eventual rupture around 9 weeks post injury. It is also likely thatpain from the deep digital flexor tendon associated with theoriginal injury contributed to the development of support limblaminitis in this case. Efforts to manage the pain associatedwith both support limb laminitis and deep digital flexor tendondisruption continued until complete tendon rupture withsubluxation of the distal interphalangeal joint resulted in adecision to subject the horse to euthanasia. The initial fracturewas healing.

The long-termoutcome in this case was good despite the soft tissue damageassociated with the fracture and the prolonged casemanagement required. The mild lameness reported followinglong work days for the police horse ( Horse 2 ) could have been a result of ongoing mild soft tissue pain, though this is purespeculation. The point being made here, however , is thatmany fractures that successfully heal carry with them theburden of the associated soft tissue injuries, which mayultimately cause ongoing pain and dysfunction in the longterm. In a report by Baxter et al . (1991) soft tissue impingement by bone plates on the radius of a mature horse was found to bethe cause of ongoing lameness 9 months following fracturerepair. The lameness resolved following removal of the plates.Fractures involving nerve or vascular injury, similar to tendon orligament involvement, can be either acute or insidious innature. Radial nerve injury has been reported most commonlyfollowing fractures of the humerus in the horse (Carter et al . 1993). Facial or vestibulocochlear nerve injury is a possibleconsequence of fractures of the petrous temporal bone orstylohyoid bone in cases of temporohyoid osteoarthropathy(Koch and Witte 2014). Rose et al . (1984) reported on a case of a comminuted femoral fracture where the popliteal artery wastransected resulting ischaemic necrosis of the distal limb.Sweeney and Hodge (1983) reported the sudden death of ahorse following laceration of the iliac artery in the case of anacetabular fracture. Breakdown injuries of the suspensoryapparatus can result in vascular thrombosis due to arterialstretching during weightbearing and hyperextension of thefetlock. These examples all highlight the fact that, while ourattention is focused on the fracture, associated soft tissueinjuries can often be the cause of pain, ongoing dysfunctionand treatment failure. Soft tissue evaluation The third aspect of fracture management highlighted in thereport by Elce and Goodrich (2015) is that completeevaluation of the soft tissues can be challenging. Beyond thedistal limb, complete evaluation of the degree of soft tissueinvolvement in fractures of the upper limbs and axial skeletonis simply not possible in all cases. For distal limb fractures, theauthors give a realistic critique of their 2 cases and the mannerin which preoperative evaluation and preparation for surgerywas approached. One of the goals of first-aid immobilisation incases of unstable limb fracture in the horse is protecting boththe bone and the soft tissues from further trauma (Mudge and Bramlage 2007). The authors rightly point out that removingcoaptation and allowing weightbearing on the limb for anultrasound examination prior to general anaesthesia is counterintuitive when an unstable distal limb fracture is present.However , this report does bring to our attention that theintegrity of the deep digital flexor tendon should beconsidered when a comminuted second phalanx fracture isaccompanied by notable distal displacement of the firstphalanx on radiographic examination. A standing,nonweightbearing ultrasound examination may beconsidered, or , when available, advanced imagingtechniques, such as computed tomography or magneticresonance imaging. The current speeds with which acomputed tomography scan can be performed on a distallimb fracture have made this modality a viable adjunct to evaluate both the fracture and the soft tissues when available.Figure 3 shows the relationship between a comminuted second phalanx fracture and the deep digital flexor tendonon a computed tomography scan performed prior to fracturerepair. However , as the authors suggest, an ultrasoundexamination at the initiation of general anaesthesia may bethe most practical and time efficient way to give someindication of deep digital flexor tendon integrity with thisparticular type of comminuted second phalanx fracture. a) b) Fig 3: a) Computed tomography image with bone window levels from the pastern of a horse showing the configuration of acomminuted second phalanx fracture. b) Computed tomographyimage with soft tissue window levels from the pastern of a horseshowing the configuration of a comminuted second phalanxfracture and its relationship with the deep digital flexor tendon onthe palmar surface of the VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015Conclusion Comminuted second phalanx fractures can be challenging totreat in the horse. Additional injury of the deep digital flexortendon may complicate treatment and should be consideredin these cases. Soft tissues play a role in structural supportduring fracture healing, may be a source of ongoing pain anddysfunction in many fracture cases and can be challenging toassess at the initial presentation of a fracture in the horse.

Brief Summary: See package insert for full prescribing information. Caution: Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. Description TILDREN is a sterile powder. Each vial of TILDREN contains 500 mg of tiludronic acid (as tiludronate disodium) and 250 mg mannitol USP (excipient). Indication TILDREN is indicated for the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses. Contraindications Do not use in horses with known hypersensitivity to tiludronate disodium or to mannitol. Do not use in horses with impaired renal function or with a history of renal disease. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal impairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Warnings Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. NSAIDs should not be used concurrently with TILDREN. Concurrent use of NSAIDs with TILDREN may increase the risk of renal toxicity and acute renal failure. Appropriate wash-out periods should be observed between NSAID and TILDREN administration, and BUN and creatinine should be monitored. If treatment for discomfort is required after TILDREN administration, a non-NSAID treatment should be used. Human Warnings Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of accidental human exposure. Precautions Approximately 30-45% of horses administered TILDREN will demonstrate transient signs consistent with abdominal pain (colic). Hand-walking the horse may improve or resolve the colic signs in many cases. If a horse requires medical therapy, non-NSAID treatments should be administered due to the risk for renal toxicity. Avoid NSAID use. TILDREN should be administered slowly and evenly over 90 minutes to minimize the risk of adverse reactions. Horses should be well hydrated prior to administration of TILDREN due to the potential nephrotoxic effects of TILDREN. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution, and if administered, renal function should be monitored. Caution should be used when administering TILDREN to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), hypocalcemia, etc.) and conditions which may be exacerbated by hypocalcemia (e.g. cardiac disease). TILDREN should be used with caution in horses receiving concurrent administration of other drugs that may reduce serum calcium (such as tetracyclines) or whose toxicity may exacerbate a reduction in serum calcium (such as aminoglycosides). Horses with HYPP (heterozygous or homozygous) may be at an increased risk for adverse reactions, including colic signs, hyperkalemic episodes, and death. The safe use of TILDREN has not been evaluated in horses less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of TILDREN has not been evaluated in pregnant or lactating mares, or in breeding horses. Increased bone fragility has been observed in laboratory animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair microdamage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; however, a causal relationship has not been established. Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions reported in the eld efcacy and safety studies were clinical signs consistent with abdominal discomfort or colic. Other reported signs were frequent urination, muscle fasciculations, polyuria with or without polydipsia, and inappetance/anorexia.

SmartPak.com/ColiCareDVMCase Report Computed tomographic myelography of a foal extradural spinal cord compression due to avertebral abscess E. B. Garcia, D. S. Biller*, L. Beard, B. Bawa, E. Nuth and M. Goravanahally Department of Clinical Sciences, Section of Diagnostic Imaging,Equine Medicine, andDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, College of V eterinary Medicine, Kansas Quarter Horse colt presented with progressive gait abnormalities and weakness. The foal was ataxicat presentation. Radiography identified spinal cord lesion corresponding to thesite of discospondylitis. Post mortem examination findings included abscess formation at the C6-7 intervertebral spacewith osteomyelitis and cranial C7. into the ventral spinal canal at C6-7 and wasidentified as the cause of extradural spinal cord compression.Salmonella sp. was cultured and isolated from purulent exudate at the intervertebral space. Computed tomographicmyelography has not been previously reported for assessmentof discospondylitis in horses and was successful at accuratelycharacterising spinal cord compression in addition to osteolyticchanges associated with discospondylitis. Introduction Discospondylitis is an infection of the intervertebral disc andadjacent endplates of the associated vertebral bodies(Thomas 2000). Discospondylitis most commonly affectsdogs, especially large breeds, and is generally attributedto a haematogenous route of infection (Moore 1992; Thomas2000). Few case reports are published describingdiscospondylitis in horses and only 2 cases have been reportedin foals (Adams et al . 1985; Chaffin et al . 1995). A case series under the heading of osteomyelitis due to rhodococcalinfection describes lesions in a single foal that are consistentwith a localisation fitting discospondylitis (Giguere and Lavoie1994). If we consider this case as discospondylitis, only a totalof 3 foals have been reported with discospondylitis and allhave utilised radiography as the sole diagnostic imagingmodality. A recent case identified a compressive spinal lesionin a of C2 caudalendplate abnormalities (Hu et al . 2009). Despite involvement of the C2-3 intervertebral space, this case was not classified asdiscospondylitis. Diagnosis and localisation in (CT) myelography. There are no cases reported to date that use imaging other than radiography for diagnosing discospondylitis in foals, andno cases are reported with evaluation of discospondylitis inhorses using CT myelography. To the authors' knowledge, the presented herein is the first utilisation of CT myelographyfor describing discospondylitis in a foal with correspondingspinal cord compression and histopathological correlation. Case background and history A one-month-old Quarter Horse colt was presented with a oneweek history of difficulty rising, weakness and shuffling whenwalking. Clinical signs were reported to have worsened 2 daysprior to presentation. Foaling was reportedly uncomplicatedand the dam had no history of vaccination prior to foaling.There was no history of trauma, previous infection, or injectionsin the cervical region in the foal. Clinical findings At presentation, the foal was recumbent, and could standfor a short period of time with assistance. No superficial ordeep pain was identified in the thoracic or pelvic limbs.Neuroanatomic localisation was consistent with a lesion ofthe cervical spine. Temperature, pulse and respiratory ratewere within normal limits. The only abnormality detectedon a complete blood count and serum chemistry was fibrinogen concentration of 7.0 g/l (reference range1.0-4.0 g/l). Cerebrospinal fluid obtained from theatlanto-occipital space had a normal white cell count (2 \u00d710 6 cells/l) and total protein concentration (430 mg/l). Cytological examination of cerebrospinal fluid revealed 10% of thenucleated cells were neutrophils, and a mild neutrophilia wasreported (consistent with either an inflammatory process orblood contamination). Radiography Radiographs were obtained of the cervical spine ( Fig The was The lytic lesion wassolitary, and, by contrast, vertebral bodies at adjacent levelshad thin, well demarcated, smooth endplates and physes. Theradiographic diagnosis was discospondylitis at C6-7. Outcome Additional diagnostics were recommended that included ,CT EDUCATION / FEBRUARY 2015recommendations included antibiotic therapy and surgicaldebridement of the infected area. Due to poor prognosis, theowner elected euthanasia. Computed tomography To characterise the lesion Computed tomography and CT myelography wereplanned for the immediate post mortem period. Tomography was performed with a 16 slice helical CT scanner(Brightspeed) 1with slices reconstructed in 5 mm and 0.625 mm thickness in the transverse plane. Isotropic multiplanarreconstructions were in the the C7vertebral body ( Fig 2 ). At this level there was poorly circumscribed soft tissue density material within the ventralspinal canal and loss of epidural fat myelography wasindicated at this point to better define spinal cord margins and help determine the origin of the increased volume of materialin the spinal canal. Following survey images, a needle was placed into the subarachnoid space at the atlanto-occipital cistern and atotal volume (iohexol, 240 mg/ml; Omnipaque) 2was injected. When post contrast images were viewed in a bone window,compression and attenuation of contrast material in thesubarachnoid space were most severe at the level of the C6-7intervertebral space ( Figs 3 and 4). When viewed in a soft tissue window, a moderate volume of broad based focal softtissue attenuating material, located in the ventral spinal canal,caused dorsal spinal cord displacement from the level ofmid-C6 vertebral mid-C7 vertebral Compressive material in the ventral spinal canalwas considered to most likely be an abscess contiguous withthe corresponding intervertebral disc space lesion. Post mortem and histopathology Grossly, the entire joint between C6 and C7 vertebral bodies contained an abscess filled with yellow purulent exudate thatfocally expanded and replaced the disc material, andextended into the adjacent vertebrae ( Fig 6 ). The protruded dorsally into the vertebral canal and compressedan overlying 4 mm segment of the cervical spinal cord. Microscopically, the subchondral bone of the C6 and C7 vertebrae contained many degenerate and intact neutrophilsthat replaced the bony trabeculae resulting in fragmentation,necrosis and spicules ( Fig 7 ). The the abscess wasmarkedly thickened by subperiosteal reactive boneproliferation. There was a mild to moderate increase infibroblasts and collagen fibres in the adjacent less severelyaffected intertrabecular spaces. At the site of compression of the spinal cord, the dorsal, ventral and lateral funiculi contained multifocal Occasionally, the gitter cells (digestion chambers). Multifocally, thesubdural adipose connective tissue and the epineurium of thespinal nerve roots adjacent to the affected spinal cordcontained small to moderate numbers of lymphocytes,plasma cells and a few macrophages and neutrophils ( Fig 9 ). axonal degeneration, and lymphocyticperineuritis. Salmonella typhimurium var 5 was isolated from the swab of the C6-C7 joint. Discussion body endplates on either side of anintervertebral space in the current case is consistent withprevious radiographic descriptions of horses withdiscospondylitis (Adams Discospondylitis in horses is often of haematogenous origin (Collins et al . 1971; Giguere Fig 1: Lateral radiograph centred at the caudal cervical spine. Cranial is to the left, and dorsal is to the top of the image. Thecaudal C6 and cranial C7 vertebral endplates (white arrows) are and the intervertebral space is narrowed. Note the smoothmargins and well delineated cranially adjacent space betweenC5 and C6 vertebral bodies for comparison.

There is focal irregularly marginatedosteolysis involving the caudal C6 endplate (openarrow). Osteolytic lesions are more left (brace). \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd76 EQUINE 1994; Chaffin et al . 1995), although traumatic origin has also been suspected in one case (Adams et al . 1985). The route of infection in the current case was not known;however , with no history of regional injection or trauma, ahaematogenous route was suspected. No nidus for infection,such as pneumonia or omphalophelbitis, was present in thecurrent case; therefore, the source of the haematogenousinfection could not be determined. Computed tomographic myelography identified compressive material in the ventral spinal at C6-7 whichcorresponded well with histopathology where an abscessinvolving the entire intervertebral disc space, also protrudeddorsally into the ventral spinal canal. With involvement of theentire intervertebral space, adjacent vertebral bodyendplates and epidural space, it is difficult to determine thespecific initial localisation of infection. As a haematogenousroute was suspected it is important to consider the vascularanatomy of the intervertebral disc and vertebral bodies. Ananatomic investigation of intervertebral discs and vertebral body endplates in horses identified small vessels within thedense regular collagenous tissues in the periphery ofintervertebral discs (Yovich et al . 1985). Infection localising in these peripherally located small vessels could result in infectioninitiating in the outer margins of the intervertebral disc andpotentially explain why there was a greater degree of purulentmaterial extending dorsally from the intervertebral tolocalisation for osteomyelitis. (Stashak and Adams 2002).Additionally, vessels may traverse physes allowing for extensionof infection from the metaphysis to the epiphysis (Stashak andAdams 2002). In dogs, the source of infection fordiscospondylitis typically originates from capillary beds in thevertebral endplates with spread to the adjacent intervertebraldisc through porous endplates (Thomas 2000) and a similarprocess could have occurred in the current case. Within theepidural space the vertebral venous plexus is subject to Fig 3: Transverse 1.25 mm thick reconstructions of the C6-7 intervertebral space in a bone algorithm and bone window (window width = 2000, window level = 500), following injection of contrast material into the subarachnoid space.

The adjacentintervertebral spaces show well defined, smooth endplates and nodisplacement or compression of contrast columns.

Dorsal is tothe top and cranial is to the left. A moderate volume of broadbased focal soft tissue attenuating material is located in the ventralspinal canal (asterisk) causing dorsal spinal cord displacementfrom the level of mid-C6 to mid-C7. With contrast in thesubarachnoid space, extradural compressionbecomes clearly evident. \u00a9 2014 Ltd77 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015conditions resulting in intermittent flow, thus allowing time forbacteria to settle in the vertebral column (Dyce et al . 2010). Epidural abscess formation has been reported in a dog inconjunction with discospondylitis following epidural injection(Remedios et al . 1996), but this route of infection is considered unlikely in this case as there was no history of perispinalinjection. In a case series investigating epidural empyema indogs, 3 of which had concurrent discospondylitis, ahaematogenous origin was suspected based on positiveblood cultures for several of these cases (Lavely et al . 2006). As epidural empyema can occur either independent of, or inconjunction with discospondylitis, extension of infection fromthe epidural space as the primary source of infection, into theintervertebral disc space, cannot be entirely ruled out. Salmonella sp. has not been reported previously as an aetiological agent for discospondylitis in horses. V ertebralosteomyelitis has been reported in a horse with positive bloodand faecal cultures for Salmonella typhimurium (Markel et al . 1988). Infectious arthritis due to Salmonella sp. has been reported at the C1-2 articulation in a 6-week-old foal, but itshould be noted that no intervertebral disc is present at thisjoint (Roberts et al . 2010). Reported bacterial agents for equine discospondylitis include Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative and Carstens 2006). A total of 13 cases reported specifically as discospondylitis in horses are available, with only 2 of these cases involvingfoals (Adams et al . 1985; Three other cases reported as vertebral osteomyelitis but bearing descriptions resemblingdiscospondylitis have been published, 2 of which involvedfoals (Collins et al . 1971; Giguere and Lavoie 1994; Hu et al . 2009). Typical radiographic findings from these studies includeendplate destruction with adjacent sclerosis, disc spacewidening or narrowing, ventral new bone formation andoccasional subluxation. Radiographic findings were similar inthis case. Furthermore, the lesion can be classified as activelydestructive, as previously described smooth new bone formation associated with recovery from discospondylitis inboth horses and dogs was not observed (Hillyer et al . 1996; al . 2009). Computed tomography improved the ability to determine the extent of osteolysis into the adjacent vertebral bodies aswell as aiding in determining the laterality of the lesion.V ertebral osteomyelitis and discospondylitis may be todistinguish the difference in lesionlocalisation between discospondylitis and vertebralosteomyelitis, cases with descriptions matching that ofdiscospondylitis have been reported as vertebral osteomyelitis(Collins et al Giguere and Lavoie 1994; Hu et al . 2009). While all 3 of these cases involved 2 adjacent vertebrae andtheir respective intervertebral disc space, it may have beenimpossible to determine the initial site of infections.Discospondylitis and vertebral osteomyelitis may differ inaetiology or treatment, and CT may be useful for theirdistinction. Spinal cord compression is an inconsistent finding associated with discospondylitis. In dogs evaluated withmagnetic resonance imaging, 15 of 17 sites withdiscospondylitis had compressive lesions (Carrera et al . 2011). No cases of equine discospondylitis have been evaluated withmagnetic resonance imaging and of 2 cases evaluated withradiographic myelography, only one had correspondingspinal cord compression (Adams et al . 1985; Furr et al . 1991). A case of in a foal spinal cordcompression and (Hu et al . 2009). Computed tomography may have greater sensitivity for detecting compressive spinal cordlesions compared with radiography. When compared to CTmyelography as a standard, noncontrast CT was found to bemore sensitive than radiographic myelography detectionof compressive spinal cord lesions secondary to intervertebraldisc extrusion in dogs (Newcomb et al . 2012). No comparison is available to evaluate differences in success between CT and CT myelography for identifying spinal cord compression inhorses. In dogs, CT myelography has been used to confirmlesions suspected on precontrast CT or used to identifycompressive spinal cord lesions entirely not visible onprecontrast CT (Shimizu et al . 2009). We did not have radiographic myelography to compare with CT to the spinalcord with a high degree of confidence. A disadvantage of CT with horses is patient size. Examination in mature horses would be limited to the cranialcervical spine, which may be disadvantageous as the majorityof reported lesions are at the caudal cervical spine andcervicothoracic junction (Adams et al . 1985; Colbourne et al . 1997). In young foals, the limitation of size is less important. Computed tomography images were acquired immediately post mortem . While the effect of post mortem acquisition on CT findings is unknown, we observed goodcorrelation between imaging findings and post mortem examination. Cerebrospinal fluid is continually generated inthe live animal (Dyce et al . 2010) and can cause a dilution of contrast media with time, potentially limiting the allowabletime between contrast injection and imaging.

Computed tomographicmyelography provided accurate description of cervical spinalcord compression at the site of discospondylitis. While CT is notalways indicated to obtain a diagnosis for discospondylitis, itmay be considered when radiographic findings are negativeor a compressive spinal cord lesion is suspected.

Scrivani Departments of Clinical Sciences, Cornell University, College of V eterinary Medicine, Ithaca, New imaging Summary Suppurative infections are typically caused by pyogenic bacteria, and are characterised by the formation of purulentexudates (pus). These infections may occur anywhere in thebody and are particularly life-threatening when pertaining tothe central nervous system (CNS). Suppurative infections of theCNS may be due to trauma, local extension of disease, andhaematogenous spread. In horses, suppurative infections arean important cause of morbidity and mortality, but onlyinfrequently involve the CNS. The gross morphology ofsuppurative inflammation is described as phlegmon, abscessand empyema, with each form having characteristicmorphological features that may be identified duringadvanced imaging of the CNS. In horses with known orsuspected suppurative infection of the CNS, imaging may beperformed to reduce diagnostic uncertainty, determineprognosis, or to describe the character and extent of thedisease to guide case management. Suppurative infections commonly are the result of invasion and multiplication of pyogenic bacteria in the body. Theseinfections may occur anywhere in the body and arecharacterised by the formation of pus, which is a protein-richexudate containing leucocytes (mostly neutrophils) (Riedeand Werner 2011). These infections are particularly life-threatening when they involve the central nervous system(CNS). Suppurative infections of the CNS may occur due totrauma (e.g. direct penetration), local extension of disease (e.g. otitis media/interna), and haematogenous spread (e.g.diskospondylitis; Fig 1 ) (Resnick and Kransdorf 2005). In horses, suppurative infections are an important cause of morbidityand mortality, but only infrequently involve the CNS. In horseswith known or suspected suppurative infection of the CNS,imaging may be performed to reduce diagnostic uncertainty,determine prognosis, or to describe the character and extentof the disease to guide case management (Scrivani 2011;Manso-D\u00edaz et al . 2014). The recent case report by Garcia et al . (2015) demonstrates the utility of diagnostic imaging for managing horses with suppurative infections of the CNS. The gross morphology of suppurative inflammation is determined by the duration and location of the infectionwithin the body. Site-specific anatomic structures provideeither characteristic resistance to the spread of infection, orallow the spread through anatomic spaces. Threemorphologies of . 2008a). A phlegmon is a solid mass of inflammatory tissue that results from a diffuse, poorlydefined spread of suppurative inflammation throughout looseconnective tissues (Resnick and Kransdorf 2005; Helms et al . 2008a). Phlegmon might progress an abscess asnecrotic coalesce and the lesion becomescircumscribed (Johnson 2000). An abscess is an abnormalcavity within the body that is filled with purulent material and Fig 1: Transverse computed tomography scans (bone window) of the left temporal region of a 20-year-old Morgan gelding with quidding. a) The scan focuses on the tympanic bulla (arrow), which is minimally thick with moderate, irregular, periosteal new bone. The tympaniccavity also is filled with fluid-attenuating material. b) The temporomandibular joint space (arrows) is wide and the margins are severelyirregular with loss of bone on both sides of the joint. Arthrocentesis and sample analysis confirmed the computed tomography diagnosisof infectious arthropathy and otitis was detected.81 \u00a9 2015 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015surrounded by a capsule lined with granulation tissue ( Fig 2 ) (Helms et al . 2008a). Empyema is the collection of pus in a body cavity (e.g. the epidural space) (Riede and Werner2011). During medical imaging, recognising these differentmorphologies can facilitate the diagnosis of suppurativeinfection, guide case management (e.g. an abscess might beamenable to surgical intervention whereas phlegmon mightnot) and provide information about the chronicity of the lesion(Johnson 2000; Resnick and Kransdorf al . 2008a; Manso-D\u00edaz et al . 2014). Other imaging signs, such as the presence of gas, fracture or bone lysis, also contribute to theoverall diagnostic process. The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord; however , imaging of the CNS also includes examination of thesupporting soft and hard tissues (Scrivani 2011). Evaluation ofall these components is important because disruption of ligaments, pathological fractures etc. may impact casemanagement or treatment, increase understanding as tothe cause of disease, or more fully characterise theextent of disease ( Fig 3 ). Several imaging modalities are available for the Scrivani 2011; Butler et al . 2013; Thrall 2013). Selection of which examination to perform depends ona number of factors including anatomic localisation of thelesion, horse size considerations that limit which body partsmay be examined using specific imaging technologies, cost,availability of imaging modalities and whether generalanaesthesia must be performed (Scrivani 2011). In almost allcases where imaging is performed, radiography is performedfirst because it is commonly available, usually does not requiregeneral anaesthesia, can be used to examine the head andneck (and occasionally more caudally), and often providessufficient information to guide initial case managementdecisions (Butler et al . 2013; Scrivani 2013; Thrall 2013). In selected cases, myelography or advanced cross-sectionalimaging is performed to determine the extent of disease,provide a more confident diagnosis, and rule-out otherunderlying conditions (e.g. fracture) (Scrivani 2011; Butler et al 2013; Manso-D\u00edaz et al . 2014). When performing CT or MRI of horses with known or suspected suppurative infections of the CNS, the resultingtissue alterations are typically apparent precontrast, butadministration of contrast material (iodinated agents for CT;gadolinium-based agents for MRI) is useful to enhanceanatomic detail and lesion conspicuity, unless there is a knowncontraindication to using contrast material (Mattoon 2009;Pollard and Puchalski 2011). Contrast enhancement ofinflamed tissue occurs due to increased blood flow to theaffected tissue or due to increased vascular permeabilitycausing leakage of contrast material from the blood vesselwalls (Pollard and Puchalski 2011). In the brain, the latterindicates a disruption to the blood brain barrier. In general,suppurative infection of the CNS is associated with somedegree of contrast enhancement (Helms et al . 2008a). The lack of contrast enhancement might indicate lack of blood Fig 2: Transverse (a) and dorsal (b) T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging scans of a 2-year-old Thoroughbred mare thatsustained head trauma 4 weeks earlier. The right cerebralhemisphere contains a focal, large, intra-axial abscess (A). Basedon necropsy, the abscess was attributed to local extension ofinfection arising from the right temporomandibular joint thatdeveloped because of the trauma. Fig 3: Lateral radiograph of the caudal neck of a 6-year-oldHaflinger gelding with a stiff, ataxic gait and reduced range ofmotion in the neck. Note the locally extensive polyostoticaggressive bone lesion that involves C6, C7, T1, VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015flow to that portion of abnormal tissue (e.g. necrotic centre of an abscess) (Helms et al . 2008a). Alternatively, intrathecal contrast material administration (i.e. myelography) during radiography or CT of the vertebral columnto differentiate intradural-extramedullaryor intramedullary (Kirberger Butler et al . 2013). In many animals, intrathecal injection of contrast material is no longerperformed or only rarely performed because cross-sectionalimaging modalities produce more accurate informationwithout the risks associated with intrathecal contrastadministration (Kirberger 2006; Thrall 2013). In horses, however ,myelography remains an important diagnostic tool, ascross-sectional imaging may not allow examination of certainportions of the vertebral column (Scrivani 2011). Intrathecaladministration of contrast material is contraindicated whenthere is increased intracranial or intraspinal pressure, soft-tissueinfection at the puncture site, coagulopathy, hepatic or renalinsufficiency, or a history of previous adverse reaction toiodinated contrast agents (Mattoon 2009). A phlegmon can occur within the neurocranium, the vertebral column or the adjacent tissues. An example ofphlegmon in the CNS is cerebritis, which is an ill-defined inflammatory 2000; Manso-D\u00edazet al 2014). In general, phlegmon is not detected during radiography but may be suspected when there is nonspecificsoft-tissue swelling and disruption of fascial planes, with orwithout gas in the soft tissues. On cross-sectional imaging (e.g.CT or MRI) cerebritis appears as locally extensive soft-tissueswelling with poorly defined margins, reduced attenuation(CT) or altered T1 and T2 signal intensities (MRI), and moderatecontrast enhancement throughout the lesion (Johnson 2000;Helms et al . 2008a). In cases of diskospondylitis, phlegmon is a common finding in severely affected horses as the infectionmay spread from the intervertebral disk to surround thevertebrae and paravertebral musculature (Helms et al . 2008b; Carrera et al . 2011). Abscesses may form anywhere in the body and may cause neurological deficits through neural compression when theabscess is located within or adjacent to the brain or spinalcord ( Fig 4 ). As with phlegmon, most abscesses are not detected during radiography unless substantial gas, swelling orfascial plane disruption is present. On cross-sectional imaging,an abscess typically appears as a focal, round,space-occupying lesion that generally has a well-defined soft-tissue peripheral rind and a centrally located space that isfilled with fluid and cells (Audigi\u00e9 et al . 2004). Following intravenous contrast material administration, there typically isstrong peripheral contrast enhancement and no contrastenhancement centrally. As with the other morphologies of suppurative CNS infection, empyema generally is not detected duringradiography. Because the infection is located within a bodycavity, it may spread freely within this space and often is seenconforming to the shape of the cavity. Within the cranialcavity, accumulation of pus in the subdural or epidural spacemay have a characteristic crescent or aspreviously subdural or Tali 2008; Scrivani 2013). typically has the same attenuation (CT) andT1 and T2 signal intensities (MRI) as other proteinaceous fluids.In general, the fluid does not demonstrate contrastenhancement, but the surrounding inflamed tissues mightenhance following intravenous administration of contrastmaterial (Johnson 2000; Gultekin and Tali 2008). Once a lesion is identified with advanced imaging, a helpful approach is to categorise the location of the lesion asintra-axial (i.e. within the brain/cord parenchyma) orextra-axial (i.e. between the skull and brain or the cord andthe vertebrae) (Scrivani 2011). In the brain, a phlegmon orabscess may have an intra-axial location (Audigi\u00e9 et al 2004). Empyema, however extra-axially subdural) (Johnson 2000; Gultekin and Tali 2008). Anabscess also could have an extra-axial location (Scrivani2011). In the vertebral column, phlegmon may location, mayhave an extradural location (e.g. epidural). Suppurativemeningitis could be considered as having an intradural-extramedullary distribution. Suppurative infections also mayinvolve the supporting musculoskeletal 2010; Scrivani 2011). In these instances, determining whether the infection involves the actual CNS isimportant. With all of this in mind, it is important to recognisethat the overall imaging appearance of suppurative infectionsvaries with the age of the lesion, location of the infection withinthe body, and factors associated with blood flow/supply tothe lesion. It is also important to recognise that b) a) A A* *T6T6 LT5 In materialsurrounding the spinal cord (*) isseverely attenuated and displacedto the left by a poorly defined, focal,extradural, soft-tissue attenuation(A) located in the right side of thevertebral canal. In (b), there issevere impedance to the flow ofcontrast material caudal to theabscess (A), which compresses anddisplaces the cord to the left. \u00a9 2015 EVJ Ltd83 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015infections may have similar imaging findings to suppurativeinfections, and that image interpretation should be performedwith integration of clinical information including cytology andculture ( Fig 5 ). Conclusion Suppurative infections are a common cause of morbidity andmortality in horses. These infections are particularlylife-threatening when they involve the CNS. In horses withknown or suspected suppurative infection of the CNS, medicalimaging plays an important role in establishing the diagnosis,determining the extent of disease (necessary for case management), and allows for follow-up evaluation forprogression or resolution of signs (Scrivani 2011). suppurative infections These differentiations often can be discerned duringadvanced imaging examinations and thereby assist with casemanagement decisions (Johnson 2000; Audigi\u00e9 et al . 2014). When there is neural compression, it is helpful to furthercharacterise brain lesions as intra-axial or will reduce diagnostic uncertainty and helpdetermine whether surgical intervention might be helpful.

Leftlaryngeal function during endoscopy at rest and overgroundexercise was scored by 3 blinded examiners. A newsemiquantitative subjective-descriptive score was used forevaluation of ultrasonographic images. Sensitivity andspecificity as well as positive and negative predictive values ofultrasonographic images for longitudinal and transverseplanes were calculated in reference to endoscopic scoringresults. Laryngeal ultrasonography with semiquantitativegrading proved to be a very sensitive and specific techniquefor evaluation of recurrent laryngeal neuropathy in Warmbloodhorses. Introduction Endoscopic diagnosis of left recurrent laryngeal neuropathy(RLN) at rest often results in ambiguity of clinical findingsregarding the dynamic laryngeal function during exerciseespecially Franklin et al . 2008), albeit Barakzai and Dixon (2011) revealed that resting endoscopicexamination graded by the Havemeyer system is an accuratepredictor of dynamic laryngeal function. Resting endoscopy isgenerally limited to in subclinical RLN or incomplex dynamic upper airway obstructions, where abductordysfunction or collapse of multiple airway structures are solelyoccurring during exercise, there is often a misdiagnosis inresting endoscopy (Lane et al . 2006a; Barakzai and Cheetham 2012). Moreover , the full extent of dynamic laryngeal collapseis only visible during exercise endoscopy (Franklin et al . 2008; Barakzai and Cheetham 2012). Nevertheless, endoscopicevaluation is limited to luminal laryngeal structures, while theintrinsic laryngeal musculature cannot be directly visuallyassessed (Chalmers et al . 2006). Ultrasonographic evaluation of RLN-affected muscle regarding its echotexture haspreviously been shown to be a valuable diagnostic tool for RLNby several authors (Tessier 2006; Garrett et al . 2011; Chalmers et al . 2012). Appropriate ultrasonographic planes for visualisation of the lateral cricoarytenoid muscle (CAL) havebeen described by Chalmers et al . (2006). A high sensitivityand specificity of 90 and 98%, respectively (Garrett et al . 2011) was found in Thoroughbred horses regarding a relativeincrease in echogenicity of the lateral CAL. In this study, thediagnostic value of laryngeal ultrasonography in Warmbloodhorses affected by RLN was investigated. Material and methods Animals All 59 Warmblood horses were examined by laryngealultrasonography while endoscopy at rest was performed on55/59 horses. Overground endoscopy was carried out for 43/59horses. Horses were of mixed gender (42 geldings, 3 stallionsand 14 mares), age (3-23 years, median 8 years) and height ofwithers (156-187 cm, median 170 cm). Clinically healthyWarmbloods aged >2 years were included in the study while horses with previous upper airway surgery or lameness wereexcluded. Ultrasonographic findings of laryngeal dysplasia (n =2) also led to exclusion from the study. All horses wereexamined clinically including auscultation of the lung andpalpation of the larynx and mandibular lymph nodes.Abnormal respiratory noises were documented duringexercise. Endoscopy at rest For the examination at rest, a flexible endoscope (OlympusEVIS EXERA II HDTV) 1and EXERA II)1were used. Left laryngeal function was evaluated after nasal occlusion and induction of swallowing. Scoringof laryngeal function by 3 blinded examinersaccording to Havemeyer laryngeal grading system (2004). Forstatistical analysis, notaffected III.1-IV ); values of the examiners' results were calculated. Overground endoscopy For the examination during exercise, a flexible portable system(OptoMed DRS V3) 2was used. Digital videos of the larynx were taken during a standardised exercise programme including2-3 min of trot and canter in each of subsequently termedhead positions (long and low, collection and hyperflexion),followed by 3 min of trot in a free head position. Evaluation ofdynamic laryngeal function considering arytenoid abduction,vocal cord vibration and vocal cord- or ventricle collapse(defined as dynamic laryngeal collapse, DLC) was performedby 3 blinded examiners as previously described (Rakestrawet al . 1991) and modified (Go et al . 2013) as shown in Table 1 .86 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015For statistical analysis, horses were classified dichotomously as 'normal' if not affected by DLC ( grades A-B1 ) or 'affected' (grades B2-C3 ); mean values of the examiners' results were used. Ultrasonography For the ultrasonographic examination, a Logiq E9 ultrasoundmachine 3and a broad spectrum linear transducer (Type L8-18i)3with a frequency of 12 MHz and a depth of penetration of 3.3 cm were used. All presets remained constant during thestudy to ensure intra- and interindividual comparability. In theleft and right caudolateral window (Chalmers et al . 2006), 3-6 captured sonographic images of the CAL were taken in thelongitudinal (long.) ( Fig 1 ) and transverse (transv.) planes of the larynx, referring to the definition of ultrasonographicsection planes of (Chalmers et al . 2006) during mild contralateral neck extension to facilitate the ultrasonographicexamination and to compare both sides. Scoring wasperformed semiquantitatively by 3 blinded examinerscomparing both sides and using a subjective-descriptive scoresystem including muscle echogenicity and identifiability(Table 2 ). Left muscle echogenicity was assessed as iso- or hyperechogenic compared to contralateral right referenceside and calculated referring to Table 2 . The evaluation of ultrasonographic images in both section planes of eachpatient was performed in immediate succession to ensure finalscoring on overall image impression. For the methodicvalidation of the score-parameters' aptitude, the rightreference CAL was additionally assessed. A final mean valuewas calculated for each side and section plane according toboth parameters and all examiners. Afterwards, the differencebetween both sides was calculated for each section plane. Statistics Statistical analysis was performed using SAS (version 9.3)software by logistic regression, receiver operatingcharacteristic analysis and contingency tables for evaluationof sensitivity and specificity. Subsequently, the positive (PPV)and negative (NPV) predictive values for semiquantitativescoring of laryngeal ultrasonography in 2 section planes werecalculated ( Table 3 ) in reference to resting and dynamic endoscopy. The comparison to dynamic endoscopy served toevaluate the association between ultrasonography and thecurrent gold standard for dynamic upper airway diseases inthe horse, while the comparison to resting endoscopy servedto evaluate the association between ultrasonography and themost widely used diagnostic imaging technique for equineupper airways. For statistical analysis endoscopic data weredichotomised as stated above. With equal emphasis onmaximum achievable sensitivity and specificity in total, theideal ultrasonographic score cut-off point was calculated forprobands' results by the software to classify semiquantitativescoring (Kreienbrock et al . 2012) ( Table 4 ). Inter-rater reliability of the semiquantitative score was calculated according toMcNemar as a paired symmetry test and weighted kappastatistics.

V alues of inter-rater reliability forindividual score parameters and section planes are presentedinTable 6 . Discussion The endoscopic examination and grading of laryngeal function is a well-accepted technique for the diagnosis of RLN(Franklin 2008). Endoscopy at rest remains important (Favaet al . 2003; Lane et al . 2006a) but, in addition, endoscopy during exercise should be performed in cases of doubt todiagnose dynamic-stenotic upper airway disease inWarmblood horses, mainly a dynamic collapse(Kannegieter and Dore 1995; et al . al . 2005; Tan et al . 2005; Lane et al . 2006b; Franklin 2008). Studies on comparability and accordance of both techniques haveled to differing results (Kannegieter and Dore and Martin 2003; Tan et al . 2005; Lane et al . 2006a; Davidson et al . 2011). Next to post mortem histopathology, exercise endoscopy is considered the generally accepted standard for clinicaldiagnosis of dynamic laryngeal collapse (Dart et al . 2001; Lane et al . 2006a,b) and has traditionally been performed on a high-speed treadmill (Sloet van Oldruitenborgh-Oosterbaan1996), followed by increasing use of overground endoscopyover recent years (V an Erck 2011).TABLE 5: Distribution of semiquantitative scoring results of laryngeal ultrasonographic images in 2 distinct section planes regarding a)overground endoscopic grades and subgrades and b) restingendoscopy as reference a)Overground score CAL status (long.)

Therefore, the latter used in this studywas modified (Go et al . 2013) to increase the comparability to resting endoscopy. As an abduction deficit may be absent in early stages of RLN or in cases of subclinical disease (Dixon et al . 2002), early pathologies of the adductory intrinsic laryngeal musculaturerepresented by the CAL (Duncan et al . 1991) are of high clinical interest and can be visualised by laryngealultrasonography. In contrast to former studies (Garrett et al . 2011; Chalmers et al . 2012), laryngeal ultrasonography was assessed semiquantitatively by 3 blinded examiners comparing bothsides and differentiating both section planes using astandardised ultrasonographic preset. It seems possible thatinterindividual changes of ultrasonographic settings (Chalmerset al . 2012) may decrease the comparability of results especially if additional quantitative echotexture analysisamong several horses is performed. Despite this, an increase inindividual image quality and simplification of interpretation isachieved by customising the individual sonographic presetand is therefore recommended for clinical application. Thesemiquantitative scoring system proved to be easy to use afterinitial training of the examiners, which led to a high inter-raterreliability of results. Nevertheless, in contrast to research, itseems reasonable to use both section planes in a clinicalsetting to increase the validity of diagnosing RLN. We found it more difficult to achieve optimal tissue coupling and image quality in Warmblood horses comparedwith Thoroughbreds. The linear array transducer , characterisedby a high resolution and a low grade of distortion, was found tobe very useful due to its hockey-stick shape. In former studies(Garrett et al . 2011; Chalmers et al . 2012) a standard linear and a curved linear array transducer were used. Highdefinition characteristics for muscle contour and echogenicitywere also considered to be of high significance by the authors.The heterogeneity of larynx and proximal cervical structures,skin and hair coat thickness in Warmbloods influence imagequality and make it difficult to find suitable standard presets.Therefore, clipping of the hair coat was inevitable in mostWarmbloods in contrast to Thoroughbreds (Garrett et al . 2011). Especially in heavy Warmbloods, we had the impression ofincreased skin thickness and perilaryngeal soft tissue so that adifferent echogenicity can be expected compared toThoroughbreds. A pronounced mandible, tight lower jawsand thickness of the lower neck complicated the positioningof the probe, and, in tall horses (height at withers >180 cm), the range of probe window was not always sufficient.Technical artefacts may also impede the examination, forexample reflections caused by air-filled vocal ventriclesor mineralisation of the thyroid cartilage. In conclusion, astandardised ultrasonographic examination seemed to bemore difficult in Warmbloods compared to Thoroughbreds due to a higher heterogeneity of individual structures. Ultrasonographic specificity describes the correct identification of 'normal' or RLN unaffected individuals, whilecalculated sensitivity depended on chosen endoscopicreference. Ultrasonographic below 80% for bothsection planes comprising overground endoscopy asreference indicate a certain mismatch between bothdiagnostic tools. However , the responsible sonographicallyfalse negative horses (n = 4) showed predominantly laryngealgrade B2 on overground endoscopy and therefore represented the obvious reason for lower sensitivity. In contrast,the same horses still showed 'normal' resting laryngeal functionand hence explain differences in ultrasonographic sensitivitywhen resting endoscopy was used as reference. It is importantto understand that resting endoscopy should not beconsidered as the better reference; instead it demonstratesthe decreased ability of resting endoscopy to identify cases oflow grade disease in Warmbloods. Low sensitivity alsodisagrees with current studies (Garrett et al . 2011; Chalmers et al . 2012). However , as distinct to Garrett et al . (2011) and Chalmers et al . (2012), the diagnostically most challenging status 'dynamic grade B ' was most frequently found in this study, which probably implicates a higher diagnosticchallenge than assessing individuals mainly scored grade A or C. Additional reasons for different results in comparison to former studies could have been the varying accessibility ofmaximum load between overground examination ofWarmbloods and high-speed treadmill examination as well asbreed related limitations such as decreased image quality dueto thicker skin. Currently, laryngeal ultrasonography is considered useful for cases presenting with grades II.2 and III.1 during resting endoscopy (Garrett et al . 2011) in order to plan further therapeutic procedures. According to the results of thepresent study, laryngeal ultrasonography can berecommended as a very sensitive and specific additionaldiagnostic tool in cases of doubt, especially to gain animpression of the intrinsic muscle echotexture. Thesemiquantitative score, however , does not allow grading oflaryngeal function of equal quality as is possible with commonendoscopic score systems. In conclusion, ultrasonography and image interpretation should be performed by trained specialists (Ewen 2003) andconstant sonographic machine settings are suggested forindividual interindividual observation, theauthors recommend customisation of ultrasound machinesettings from necessity of a limited diagnostic value by usingthe standardised preset seen in this study. A final decision onlaryngeal function, prognosis and the following therapeuticprocedure should ideally be made as a consequence of allavailable diagnostic techniques including ultrasonography,endoscopy at rest and during exercise.

Dunkel* and K. T. T. Corley Department of Clinical Science and Services, Equine Referral Hospital, The Royal V eterinary College, North Mymms, UK; andAnglesey cause of death in neonatal foals and, inrecent years, significant progress in the understanding of theunderlying pathophysiology has been made. To achieve asuccessful outcome, early diagnosis and treatment focusingon supporting vital functions and neutralising the effects of thecausative organisms are essential. The pharmacokinetics ofmany drugs differ in neonatal foals and of antimicrobial and anti-inflammatorydrugs for neonatal foals is now available to guide clinicians inchoosing the best dosages. Prevention remains difficult andfocuses on early recognition while prophylactic use ofantimicrobials is discouraged. Introduction Sepsis is a major cause of death in foals aged <7 days (Cohen 1994). Understanding the pathophysiology helps design botheffective diagnostic tests and treatments. With earlyappropriate intervention, the survival rate for neonatal foalscan be quite good (72.5% of 120 hospitalised septic foalssurvived to discharge between 2002 and 2012, K. Corley,unpublished data). Pathophysiology Much of the pathophysiology and clinical signs of sepsis reflectthe immune response to infection, rather than direct actions ofthe infective organism on the body. One manifestation of thisis the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRSrefers to changes in the foal's heart rate, respiratory rate,temperature and/or white cell count in the face of infectionor inflammation, which are taken to be manifestations ofcytokine activation. These cytokines are chiefly the product of leucocytes and therefore the focus of much research into the pathophysiologyof SIRS and sepsis has been leucocyte activation.Endotoxaemia, which induces SIRS and can be part of sepsis(when it is due to Gram-negative organisms), has beenextensively researched. For this reason, events in mature horsesare reasonably well described although several assumptionsare still extrapolated from research in man or laboratoryanimals (McKenzie and Furr 2001; Werners and Bryant 2012). However , the concept of sepsis is ever expanding andit is now understood that leucocytes are only one aspectof an increasingly complex process and that endothelialcells, platelets, the coagulation system and endocrinedysregulation all contribute to the disease (Seeley et al . 2012; De Backer et al . 2014). In essence, molecular patterns expressed by bacteria (pathogen-associated molecularpatterns) or associated with tissue damage (damage- associated molecular patterns or alarmins) are recognised bythe immune system (Gando et al . 2011) and cause activation of the innate and adaptive immune response. This results inproduction of a myriad of pro- and anti-inflammatorysubstances and cytokines. Overactivation or -suppression ofthe immune response can lead to systemic inflammation orimmunosuppression and, if uncontrolled, to progressivecardiovascular compromise and ultimately death (Wernersand Bryant 2012). Extensive cross-talk between theinflammatory and coagulation system leads to reciprocalactivation of both systems. Systemic coagulopathies withformation of microthrombi during severe illness are thought toplay a major role in the pathogenesis of multiple organdysfunction (Levi 2010). Coagulopathies and subclinical intravascular coagulation (DIC) arecommon in critically ill of all ages (Monreal al . . 2009). In one study, fibrin deposits were detected in 88% of septic nonsurviving equine neonates, withthe lungs being most frequently affected (Cotovio et al . 2008). Organ failure, although statistically not associated with fibrindeposition, occurred in 56% of these foals and respiratoryfailure accounted for 25% of the organ failure cases (Cotovioet al . 2008). Functional failure of the microvasculature is assumed to be another reason for end-organ damage inhuman patients. Endothelial dysfunction with impaired intercellcommunication, disrupted barrier function with increasedpermeability leading to extravascular leak of protein-richoedema, altered glycocalyx, enhanced adhesion and rollingof white blood cells and platelets, and impaired distribution ofblood flow in microvascular beds are the main mechanismscontributing to these alterations (De Backer et al . 2014; Gill et al . 2014). Changes in hormonal concentrations and metabolism have been documented during sepsis. The changing nature ofthese fluctuant and temporal profiles makes it difficult tointerpret or manage hormonal alterations, and cause andeffect are often not clear. Changes can be adaptive toprotect tissues or be the consequence of toxin and cytokinerelease or of the treatments initiated by the attending clinician(Khardori and Castillo 2012). Hormonal profiles of septic foalshave been extensively researched in recent years. There isincreasing evidence that hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axisdysregulations are common in sick, and particularly septic,neonatal foals. Mounting evidence indicates that relativeadrenal insufficiency (RAI) exists and might be associated withnonsurvival (Hurcombe et al . 2007, 2008; Hart et al Hurcombe increase EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015to critical illness and are essential for maintaining vascular responses to catecholamines and angiotensin andmodulation of the immune response. During RAI, the foal is notable to mount a cortical response adequate for the degreeof illness experienced by the body. Although cortisol levelsmay be within the normal range, concentrations are relativelytoo low for the demands of the patient. Symptoms in maninclude haemodynamic instability and refractory hypotensionunresponsive to fluid and vasopressor (Langer et al . 2006). However , whether foals with RAI could benefit fromcorticosteroid administration requires further investigation.Low-dose hydrocortisone treatment in healthy foals reactive oxygen species production (Hart et al . 2011), which could argue for its use. Other hormonal dysregulations observed in septic foals include high arginine vasopressin concentrations, nonthyroidalillness syndrome in sick and premature foals and abnormalitiesin energy metabolism, including the somatotropic axis, allthought to be associated with nonsurvival (Gold . Hurcombe 2012; Dembek et al . 2013). Diagnosis The definition of sepsis in man and foals is still evolving. Most equine clinicians would probably agree that sepsis representssystemic illness caused by a disseminated or localisedinfection. Systemic activation of the inflammatory system isusually used as evidence that an infection is affecting theentire body. SIRS is frequently defined as presence of at least 2of the following criteria: hyper- or hypothermia; tachycardia;tachypnoea; and an abnormal white blood cell count orincrease in band neutrophils (McKenzie and Furr 2001). Forhuman neonatal sepsis, the definition was adapted in 2005(Goldstein et al . 2005) and is now defined as SIRS as a result of proven or suspected infection. Evaluation of the criteria forsepsis in a retrospective study showed that of 30 humanneonates with culture proven sepsis (positive blood orcerebrospinal fluid culture) only 14 (53%) fulfilled SIRS and sepsiscriteria, highlighting the difficulties with the currentclassifications. This illustrates the fact that infection in neonatescan be clinically relatively silent and none of the classificationsystems are perfect. In foals, no uniform definition for sepsis hasbeen adopted but, most commonly, a modification of thehuman definition (SIRS and infection), a positive blood cultureor a sepsis score 12, developed by Brewer et al . (Brewer and Koterba 1988) is used. The initial report (Brewer and Koterba1988) demonstrated 93% sensitivity and 86% specificity for thesepsis score. In subsequent studies on different populations, aconsiderably lower sensitivity and specificity were found(Corley and Furr 2003) and the score failed to predict sepsis in49% (29/59) of bacteraemic foals in another investigation(Stewart et al . 2002). A recent study suggested a new cut off point of >7 for the score resulting in a sensitivity and specificity of 84.4% and 41.8%, respectively, compared with 56.4% and73.4% using a cut off of >11 (Weber et al . 2014). Many clinicians have hoped that serum amyloid A (SAA) might be a goodmarker of sepsis in neonatal foals due to its fast response andshort half-life (Tape and Kisilevsky 1990; Belgrave et al . 2013). In a recent study a cut-off point of >100 mg/l for SAA concentrations to predict sepsis had a sensitivity andspecificity of 68.6% and 68.5%. The negative predictive valueof SAA concentrations >100 mg/l as indicator of sepsis in foals on admission was 87%. However , in the same study 11 and 9out of 36 foals considered to be septic had SAAconcentrations <25 mg/l and <10 mg/l, respectively, indicating that low SAA concentrations do not rule out the presence ofsepsis (Jokisalo et al . unpublished data). Treatment The major goals of treatment are to maintain homeostasis and attempt to neutralise the causative organism andexaggerated immune responses. Many organ systems areaffected, and treatment often has to be prioritised to supportthose immediately vital for life (cardiovascular system,respiratory system and central nervous system). Fluid resuscitation and cardiovascular support Acute hypovolaemia should be corrected as soon as possibleto ensure adequate bwt may be used initially. After each bolus, the foalshould be reassessed and boluses repeated as necessary untilperipheral perfusion is improved (Palmer 2004; Magdesian2005). Signs reflecting successful resuscitation may includeimproved capillary and jugular refill time, colour warming of the distal limbs, increased urineoutput and borborygmi and improved mental status. Of these,improved mentation and urine output are often the first signsof improving cardiovascular status. Increasing mean arterialpressure (MAP) and decreasing blood lactate concentrationsover time are also favourable signs. If no progress has beenachieved after rapid administration of 60-80 ml/kg bwt,corresponding to inotropes and/or vasopressors might benecessary (Palmer 2004). Although MAP is used as a measureof circulatory status, decisions should not be made on the basisof MAP alone and it is important to evaluate end-organperfusion through lactate concentrations, urine output andmentation. Dobutamine (DOB) augments cardiac output by its primary action on 1-adrenoreceptors. Starting doses of 3-5 g/kg bwt/min with subsequent titration to effect have been used in foals while closely monitoring for tachycardia,arrhythmia and other adverse reactions (Corley 2004;V alverde et al . 2006; Craig et al . 2007). In some foals, at high doses of DOB ( >15g/kg bwt/min), increasing the dose further appears to have little extra effect on 1-adrenoreceptors but can cause vasodilatation, presumably mediated via 2-adrenoreceptors, resulting in falling blood pressure. Some severely affected foals are in hyperdynamic shock after initial fluid resuscitation, resulting in decreased peripheralperfusion and low MAP despite adequate intravascularvolume and administration of inotropes. In these foals it isnecessary to try to restore a sufficient vascular tone to establisha pressure gradient and promote blood flow through theperipheral organs. However , as not all organ systems areuniformly affected by either vasodilation or the administeredvasopressors, their use always carries the risk of excessivevasoconstriction in some vascular beds, mainly the splanchniccirculation, thereby decreasing, rather than increasing,perfusion to those tissues. Norepinephrine (noradrenaline; NE)is a strong 1-adrenergic agonist with some activity on 1and minimal 2receptor activity al . 2006). 2014 2015(0.01-1.0 g/kg bwt/min) in combination with DOB might be vasopressor in hypotensive foals unresponsive tofluid resuscitation and inotropes alone. Negative effects of NEon either renal function or splanchnic circulation were notdetected in the 2 studies (Hollis et al . 2006; V alverde et al . 2006) but close monitoring remains essential. Argininevasopressin (anitdiuretic hormone) has received attention dueto its importance in maintaining blood pressure during criticalillness. Doses of 0.1-2.5 mu/kg bwt/min have been used inneonatal foals (Dickey et al . 2010). Findings in the experimental setting were suggestive of arginine vasopressininfusions (0.3 and 1.0 mu/kg bwt/min) andpossibly splanchnic hypoperfusion at the higher dose, whichwas not observed with either DOB or NE infusions (V alverdeet al . 2006). Based on this information, NE may currently be regarded as the safer option for vasopressor support inneonatal foals. Fluid maintenance Critically ill foals receiving fluid therapy are prone to oedemaformation, which may be associated with differences insodium handling, renal compromise and increased capillarypermeability induced by the primary disease process.Traditionally, 80-120 ml/kg bwt/day, depending on the age ofthe foal, been used to estimate maintenance fluidrequirements for equine neonates. Other clinicians favour a'dry' maintenance rate based on the Holliday-Segar formula:for the first 10 kg of body weight, 100 ml/kg are administered,then 50 ml for each kg from 11-20 kg and 25 ml for each kg ofbody weight >20 kg. Using this calculation, maintenance fluids for a 50 kg foal are 2250 ml/day or a maintenance rate of94 ml/h (Palmer 2004) (10 kg \u00d7100 ml/kg bwt/day + kg \u00d725 ml/kg bwt/day) plus fluids received with parenteral nutrition and medication infusions. Itis important to note that parenteral nutrition, although strictlyspeaking not representing i.v. fluids, adds free water to thetotal fluid volume administered and that this maintenanceformula is not intended to be used in foals with increased fluidlosses, such as diarrhoea. As no controlled study hascompared the 2 fluid regimes and both have been usedclinically with success, the clinician may choose eitherprotocol as a starting point from which fluid therapy can betailored to the individual case. Whichever formula is used, it isimportant to recognise that the high-sodium resuscitation fluids(such as lactated Ringer's solution or Normosol-R) are not anideal maintenance fluid and can result in high sodiumconcentrations in many foals (Buchanan et al . 2005). For thisreason, either commercially available maintenance fluids (e.g. Normosol-M) or resuscitation fluids with potassium andmagnesium added and diluted with sterile water (and eithercoadministered with glucose or parenteral nutrition tomaintain tonicity) may be more suitable fluids for many foals. Antimicrobials The majority of organisms obtained from blood cultures ofneonatal foals are comprised of enteric Gram-negativebacteria but the percentage of Gram-positive isolates hasincreased significantly over the years (Marsh and Palmer 2001;Corley et al . 2007; Russell et al . 2008; Sanchez et al . 2008). In a recent study, Enterococcus spp. were cultured more frequently in recent years. This is concerning due to theunpredictable antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and theability of the organism to act as donor of antimicrobialresistance genes to other bacteria (Theelen et al . 2014a). Antimicrobial treatment should be initiated as soon as possible,ideally after samples for culture have been obtained.However , it may be detrimental to delay antimicrobial therapyfor the sake of obtaining culture material (Kumar et al . 2006). Choosing broad-spectrum antimicrobials with the least likelyresistance against suspected pathogens is paramount.Frequently used combinations include -lactams and aminoglycosides or third or fourth generation cephalosporinsas monotherapy. Several drugs require dose adaptations inneonates due to the larger content of body water anddifferences in drug handling (Fielding et al . 2011) and ideally, pharmacokinetics established in neonates should directdosing whenever available. Dose recommendations based onpharmacokinetic studies in foals are listed in Table 1 . In the UK, cefquinome (Cobactan) is licensed for treatment of 'severe bacterial infections with a high risk ofsepticaemia in which Escherichia coli is involved' in foals at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg bwt i.v. or i.m. q. 12 h for 6-14 pharmacokinetic studies, higher doses of 4.5 mg/kg bwt q.12 h are recommended for the treatment of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)0.125-0.5 g/l for neonatal foals (Smiet et al . 2012). Time of plasma concentrations above MIC and drug concentrationsat different body sites might vary depending on administrationmode in time dependent antimicrobials. Continuous rateinfusions (CRI) of lactam antimicrobials in critically ill people showed improved pharmacodynamics profiles compared tobolus administrations (Angus et al . . Wearn et TABLE 1: Recommended antimicrobial dosages for neonatal foals based on published pharmacokinetic foals 2009; Hall 2011)Ceftiofur infusion mg/kg bwt/day; plasmasteady stateconcentration EQUINE as bolus (40 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 6 h) achieved significantly lower concentrations in synovial fluid ofneonatal foals than administration by infusion (loading dose of40 mg/kg i.v. followed 5.02 mg/l). Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations didnot differ and were low with either administration form(Hewson et al . 2013). Some antimicrobials that are cost prohibitive or cannot be used due to risk of colitis in maturehorses might offer an alternative option in foals shouldbacteria resistant to first line antimicrobials be identified(Corley and Hollis 2009). Antimicrobial sensitivity is changing over time and the aforementioned study identified worrying trends (Theelenet al . 2014a,b), although another study identified decreasing susceptibility only for enrofloxacin over a similar time period(Sanchez et al . 2008). A decrease in the percentage of isolates susceptible to gentamicin was noted from 1979-2010 andseveral bacteria including Enterobacteriacea ,showed an increase in MIC values for amikacin. A decreased susceptibilityto ceftiofur or increased MIC values for the drug werealso observed; increasing MIC values are often viewed asfirst sign of resistance development (Theelen et al . 2014b). The decrease in in vitro activity of ceftiofur against Enterobacteriaceae is of concern and it remains to be seenwhether a similar pattern could emerge with use ofcefquinome as monotherapy. Trends for changing sensitivitiesin the UK need to be established and then monitored on aregular basis (Haggett 2014). Respiratory support Pulmonary dysfunction is a common problem in critically illequine neonates and may include pulmonary immaturityand surfactant dysfunction, bacterial pneumonia, oftenassociated with sepsis or aspiration, viral pneumonia,meconium aspiration or acute respiratory distress syndrome(Peek et al . 2004; Wilkins 2004; Wilkins et al . 2007). Intranasal oxygen supplied via uni- or bilateral cannulas allows delivery offlow rates up to 20-30 l/min, which corresponds to an inspiredoxygen fraction of 70-78% and greater (Wong et al . 2010). As oxygen toxicity is a threat with administration of a high FiO 2 for longer than 24 h, the lowest possible flow rate shouldbe chosen. Treatment options for centrally mediatedhypoventilation include pharmacological stimulation of therespiratory centre using caffeine or doxapram or mechanicalventilation. Orally or rectally administered caffeine (10 mg/kgbwt loading dose dissolved per os or per rectum ; then 2.5-5.0 mg/kg bwt as needed) has been used clinically (Wilkins2004; Palmer 2005) but doxapram (loading dose 0.5 mg/kgbwt followed by 0.02-0.08 mg/kg bwt/min) seems to besuperior in stimulating breathing (Giguere et al . 2007, 2008). The principles of mechanical ventilation in foals have beenreviewed in detail elsewhere (Palmer 2005). Nutritional support If a foal is unable to stand or nurse, enteral nutrition is bestprovided via an indwelling nasogastric feeding tube.Pharyngeal dysfunction is common in compromised neonatesand tube feeding minimises the substantial risk of aspiration(Holcombe et al . 2012). A healthy foal consumes 25-30% of its bodyweight in milk/day but initial volumes for sick foals shouldbe smaller (5-10% bwt/day in frequent, small quantities) untilthe function of the intestinal tract has been established.Although enteral nutrition is preferable in theory, feeding of moderately to severely compromised neonates may result inabdominal distension, colic, diarrhoea and nasogastric of a foal with diarrhoea can greatly prolongthe duration of the disease. The resting energy requirements ofcritically ill neonates are approximately 40-50 kcal/kg bwt/day(Paradis 2001; Jose-Cunilleras al by intravenous glucose (4-8 mg/kg bwt/min) orparenteral nutrition. Treatment of systemic inflammation and coagulopathies The differences between the mature and neonatal equine immune and coagulation systems are being increasinglyexplored but remain incompletely understood. While in maturehorses with SIRS and sepsis the importance of anti-inflammatory treatment is emphasised (Kelmer 2009)treatment recommendations for sepsis in neonatal foalsfocus on maintaining normal cardiovascular and respiratoryfunction, electrolyte and acid base balance and initiatingeffective antimicrobial therapy. However , recentinvestigations suggest that use of anti-inflammatory and anti-endotoxic treatment could also be beneficial in neonates.Significantly lower blood lactate, tumour necrosis factor- and thromboxane B2 concentrations, higher blood glucoseconcentrations and better attitude scores were noted inneonatal foals endotoxaemia i.v. q. 8 h)compared with the control group (Wong et al . 2013). No evidence of nephrotoxicity was detected. Meloxicam at0.6 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h is well tolerated in healthy foals and no adverse effects were noted using 3 times this dose for7 days (Raidal et al . 2013). Whether septic foals would benefit from use of polymyxin B or meloxicam and their safety in sickfoals, particularly in regards to renal function, remains to beestablished. V ery few effective treatments are available to combat coagulopathies in any species, particularly DIC. Theconcomitant presence of hyper- and hypocoaguable stateswith risk of thrombi formation and bleeding demands use ofoften opposing treatments. Substitution of platelets andcoagulation factors in form of fresh platelet-rich plasma orfresh-frozen plasma is recommended for hypocoagulablepatients at risk of bleeding (Gando et al . 2011). In hypercoaguable patients treatment with either unfractionatedor , ideally, low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) might aid inprevention of clot formation. Low-molecular weight heparinhas fewer side effects than unfractionated heparin and onestudy suggests that it may have superior anticoagulantproperties in mature horses (Feige et al . 2003). In another study in mature horses, use of LMWH was linked by the authors with abetter outcome (Cotovio et al . 2007). Heparin has not only antithrombotic but also anti-inflammatory properties, whichcould be useful in the treatment of sepsis (de la Rebiere et al . 2008). Recommended doses are 100 iu/kg bwt subcut. q. 24 hfor neonatal foals, twice as as the mature dose (Feige et al . 2003; de la Rebiere al . 2009; Armengou et al . 2010). Fresh or fresh frozen plasma, with or without the additionof heparin (1500 u/l used anecdotally), could also be used inhypercoagulation as antithrombin concentrations, one of themain anticoagulants, are frequently low in septic foals (Bartonet al . 1998). Other treatments EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015function have no or only very limited effects on equine plateletsand coagulation and clinical effects on the coagulation systemstill need to be established (Brainard et al . 2011). Doses for anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anticoagulant drugs arelisted in Table 2 . Prognosis The prognosis for survival to discharge of hospitalised septicfoals has improved over time (Sanchez et al . 2008) and ranges in recent studies from 44-71% (Armengou al . Toth et al . 2014). Prognosis for athletic performance is considered to be good with surviving septic foals performingsimilar to age matched controls. However , most studies haveidentified some differences in some performance-relatedparameters (Axon et al . 1999; Sanchez et al . 2008). Foals treated for septic arthritis are considered to have a moreguarded prognosis for successful athletic performance,particularly if multiple joints are involved (Steel et al . 1999; Smith et al . 2004; Neil et al . 2010). However , recent large scale studies are lacking. No differences in sales prices wereidentified between foals treated in a hospital and controls(Corley and Corley 2012). Prevention Unfortunately, little can be done to prevent sepsis beyondwell-established measures such as early identification of riskfactors during pregnancy (placentitis, premature placentalseparation), meticulous birth hygiene and ensuring completepassive transfer of immunity has taken place by measuring IgGconcentrations. Prophylactic antimicrobial treatment ofhealthy neonatal foals did not show any benefits in regards todevelopment of infectious diseases and is no longerrecommended (Wohlfender et al . 2009). However , early recognition of compromised neonates and rapid instigation oftreatment seem to be the key in achieving a positive outcomeand client education in this regard is of utmost importance.

Corresponding author email: taylo248@purdue.edu Keywords: horse; foal; sepsis; biomarker Summary Sepsis is defined as an exaggerated, systemic inflammatory response to infection and is a common condition in horses.Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) associatedwith bacterial infection is a hallmark of sepsis. Sepsis inneonatal foals is a common sequela of failure of passivetransfer and, in addition to development of SIRS, may becharacterised by bacteraemia, pneumonia, enterocolitis,omphalophlebitis, meningoencephalitis or arthritis. Sepsis inmature horses is most commonly observed secondary togastrointestinal lesions that result in disrupted mucosa andbacterial translocation into circulation (endotoxaemia).Pleuropneumonia and metritis may also cause sepsis in maturehorses. Diagnosis of sepsis is based on SIRS criteria as well assuspected or confirmed infection. Due to the relatively lowsensitivity of microbial culture and the subjectivity of sepsisscoring, many sepsis biomarkers are being studied for theirusefulness in diagnosis and prognostication of sepsis in horses.Treatment of sepsis requires an intensive care approach thatincludes antimicrobial drug administration, fluid resuscitationand pressure support, and treatment for inflammation,endotoxaemia and coagulopathy. Early recognition of sepsisand prompt antimicrobial drug treatment are critical for asuccessful outcome. Multiple organ dysfunction syndromemay occur in severe cases of sepsis, with commonmanifestations including laminitis and coagulopathies.Although prognosis for septic mature horses depends highly onthe primary disease process, the overall survival rate in septicneonatal foals ranges from 26 to 86%, with most studiesindicating a survival rate of 45-60%. Introduction Despite substantial advances in medical management, sepsiscontinues to represent a leading cause of illness and death inhorses (Hoffman et al . 1992; Cohen et al . Werners et 2005; Peek et al . 2006). The body's systemic inflammatory response to microbial invasion can lead to rapid deteriorationdespite pathogen control, which presents a challenge toequine practitioners. Several terms have been used todescribe sepsis and its sequela. The American College of ChestPhysicians and the Society of Critical Care Medicine publisheda consensus report of definitions in 1992 adopted by veterinaryspecialists in order to provide accuracy and consistencyamong practitioners (Bone et al . 1992). The term systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is used to describesystemic inflammation that may be caused by infectiousagents (e.g. bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc.) or noninfectiouscauses (e.g. trauma, burns, toxins, acidosis, etc.). When SIRS isthe result of infection, it is termed sepsis. The most commoninfectious agents associated with sepsis are bacteria. Ifbacteria are present in the blood, the term bacteraemia isused. Although it has been suggested that septicaemia be eliminated from current usage because it does notadequately describe the spectrum of organisms that mayinvade the blood, it is defined as bacterial infection in theblood in conjunction with SIRS. A frequent complication of SIRSis the development of organ system dysfunction which iscalled multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Theterm severe sepsis is defined as sepsis associated withhypoperfusion, hypotension or organ dysfunction. If a patientwith severe sepsis is hypotensive despite adequate fluidresuscitation, the term septic shock is used. Finally, a syndromeof immunosuppression that may result secondary to SIRS iscompensatory anti-inflammatory syndrome (CARS)and may lead to leucocyte anergy and increasedsusceptibility to infection. Endotoxaemia, defined as the presence of Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) within the blood, is acommon finding al . Senior et al . 2011). By definition, dead Gram-negative bacteria or fragmentedLPS in the blood is not considered 'infection,' but given thesimilar proinflammatory response, endotoxaemia is considereda subset of sepsis. Horses are exquisitely sensitive to thepresence of endotoxin in the blood. Once in the blood stream,LPS may bind circulating LPS-binding protein (LBP), which as acomplex then binds the CD14 molecule on cells.The resulting complex activates toll-like to (MD2)(Werners and Bryant 2012). Pathogen associated molecularpatterns including LPS, may be recognised bypattern than TLR4,with Activation of PRRs by PAMPs triggers intracellularsignalling which results in increased transcription of severalproinflammatory Experimental intravenous (i.v.) administration of LPS to horses increases gene expression of IL1,IL6 and IL8 and TNF , and also increases the concentration of IL6 and TNF proteins in the circulation (MacKay et al 1991; MacKay and Lester 1992; Nieto et al . 2009). In addition, gene expression of TLR4 and MD2 in equine peripheral WBC hasbeen shown , IL1 and IL6 induce release of acute phase proteins from the liver. These includefibrinogen, C-reactive protein, mannose-binding lectin,complement, chemotaxis results in neutropenia.Simultaneous with WBC activation, endotoxin tocomplement proteins to activate the lectin-dependent andalternative complement which further promoteinflammation through production of peptide products.Intravascular coagulation is initiated primarily through tissuefactor activation. The net effects of proinflammatorycytokines, acute phase proteins, procoagulants andvasoactive mediators are hypoperfusion with equine endotoxaemia MODS, which maymanifest as laminitis or disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC) (Parsons et al . 2007). Manifestations of sepsis in neonatal foals and mature (non-neonatal) horses will be discussedseparately, followed by diagnosis, treatment, MODS andprognosis of sepsis in equids of all ages. Manifestations of sepsis in neonatal foals Risk factors A major risk factor for development of sepsis is failure of passivetransfer (FPT) (Jeffcott and Jeffcott 1974; Peek et al . 2006). The 'open' gut that persists for up to 24 h of age allows absorptionof bacteria through specialised enterocytes that, if uncheckedby immunoglobulin G (IgG), may overwhelm the innateimmune response and cause sepsis. Thus, bacterialtranslocation typically results in Gram-negative bacteraemiaand and Palmer 2001; Borchers et al . 2012). Other routes of microbial invasion include the umbilicus, respiratoryand genitourinary tracts and disrupted skin or mucosal barriers.Poor sanitary conditions and improper umbilical care are alsorisk factors for development of neonatal sepsis. Early detectionof FPT is important in reducing morbidity and mortality inneonatal foals and is typically done using a stall-sidecommercial IgG test (SNAP Foal IgG Test Kit) 1. This test is highly sensitive for detection of FPT and provides rapid results but isnot very specific. In other words, FPT ( <8 g/l IgG) is likely to be detected by the SNAP test but many foals with IgG <8 g/l IgG do et al . 2006). Radial immunodiffusion testing provides a more accurate and specific measurementof blood IgG but cost and turnaround time make this test lesspractical (Metzger et al . 2006). Bacteraemia Sepsis in neonatal foals can manifest in several different ways,with many foals presented with bacteraemia (Russell et al . 2008). Gram-negative bacteria are isolated more commonlythan Gram-positive bacteria in bacteraemic neonatal foalsbut the percentage of Gram-positive isolates has increasedsignificantly over the years (Marsh and Palmer 2001; Corleyet al . 2007; 2014b). Common al . 2002; Corley et al Streptococcus spp., and al . 2007; Hollis et al . 2008b), with the prevalence Enterococcus spp. increasing al . 2008; . 2014b).Pneumonia Septic pneumonia in may occur secondary to haematogenous spread in bacteraemic may hypoxia or immunocompromise maypredispose or exacerbate septic pneumonia in some foals(Paradis 1989). In one study, a diagnosis of SIRS was associatedwith increased pulmonary infiltrates in the caudodorsal lungfields of affected foals, which may have reflected vascularleakage in regions of increased blood flow (Stewart et al . 1987; Bedenice et al . 2003). In a retrospective evaluation of 65 foals with sepsis, 19% had clinical evidence of pneumonia (Gayleet al . 1998). It is important to note that in many septic foals, respiratory rate and lung auscultation are normal despitepulmonary involvement. Several studies have documented ahigher incidence of respiratory disease detected at necropsycompared to ante mortem findings in septic foals (Koterba often caused a primary intestinal pathogen that disrupts the intestinal mucosa,allowing bacterial translocation and subsequent include et al . 1996a; Gayle et al . . 2009). Omphalitis/omphalophlebitis Bacteria may gain access to the bloodstream of newborn foals via the umbilicus but this is a less common route of entrythan the intestinal tract. Of 65 foals diagnosed with sepsis inone study, 13% had omphalitis or omphalophlebitis (Gayleet al . 1998). The most common organism isolated from infected umbilical remnants is E. coli (Adams and Fessler 1987; Rohdich et al . 2009). A common complication associated with omphalitis or omphalophlebitis is development of a patenturachus, which occurred in 11 of 16 foals in one study (Adamsand Fessler 1987). Meningoencephalitis Meningoencephalitis is a rare but severe foal sepsis. Of 9 neonatal foals with confirmedbacterial meningoencephalitis presented to a referralinstitution, all demonstrated abnormal mentation, whilerecumbency and weakness were observed in 80% of foals (Viuet al . 2012). Other clinical signs included decreased suckle reflex (67%), abnormal pupillary light reflexes (60%) and seizuresand/or nystagmus (40%). The most frequently isolatedorganism was E. coli (Viu et al . 2012). Septic arthritis Haematogenous spread of bacteria to joints has been reported to occur in 14-38% of neonatal foals with sepsis(Gayle et al . et al . 2007). Approximately 50% of foals with septic arthritis have more than one joint affected,with the tarsocrural and femoropatellar joints more commonlyseeded (Meijer et should 2015 EVJ Ltd100 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015considered the primary differential in a foal that exhibits lameness and/or joint effusion (Sanchez 2005). Manifestations of sepsis in mature horses Gastrointestinal disease Equine gastrointestinal disease that results in ischaemia orinflammation may lead to loss of mucosal integrity andsubsequent migration of bacteria and LPS into the circulation.It has been shown that up to 29% of horses presenting for colicto a referral institution had detectable LPS in the circulationand that increased levels of blood LPS were positivelycorrelated with mortality (Senior et al . 2011). Endotoxaemia can occur secondary to infectious enterocolitis orstrangulating gastrointestinal lesions that lead to peritonitis.Common infectious causes of colitis in adult horses includeequine neorickettsiosis (Potomac horse induce SIRS in cases of equine neorickettsiosis. In a retrospective studyinvestigating factors associated with survival in 44 horses withequine neorickettsiosis, severity of colitis that was reflected byelectrolyte loss and prerenal azotaemia was predictive ofsurvival (Bertin et al . 2013). C. perfringens type C and, less commonly, type A , can be a primary cause of enterocolitis in adult horses, while C. difficile is often associated with antimicrobial use (Feary and Hassel 2006). Faecal samplesfrom 43 adult horses with clinical signs of acute colitis werecultured for anaerobic bacteria; C. perfringens and C. difficile were isolated in 40 and 5.4% of cases, respectively, whileSalmonella spp. were not cultured in any (Gohari et al . 2014). Salmonella spp. (may) be transiently shed in faeces of normal horses, but can cause enterocolitis in susceptible animals(Schott et al . 2001; Ernst et al . 2004). Equine coronavirus is a newly emerging infectious disease in the United States thatcauses anorexia, lethargy, fever and, occasionally, diarrhoea.Although the mortality rate is low in affected adult horses,deterioration of clinical signs may be associated withgastrointestinal translocation of bacteria and Equine duodenitis-proximal jejunitis (DPJ) is an inflammatory condition of the small intestine thatoften results in severe endotoxaemia-associated SIRS (Daviset al . 2003). Distinguishing DPJ from a surgical small intestinal lesion can be challenging, as strangulating obstructive lesionscan cause similar clinical signs including SIRS secondary toendotoxaemia, gastric reflux and colic. In a prospective study,14% of horses with strangulating small intestinal lesions requiringresection and anastomosis were bacteraemic, although thispercentage may have been falsely low given the poorsensitivity of blood culture (Hurcombe et al . 2012). Pneumonia Septic pneumonia may occur secondary to bacterial, viral or fungal infection. The most common respiratory tract diseasethat results in sepsis is pleuropneumonia, with clinical signs ofSIRS typically evident during the acute stage of disease. Themost frequently isolated aerobic bacteria in cases ofpleuropneumonia are -streptococcus sp., Pasteurella sp., E. coli and Enterobacter sp. (Sweeney et al . 1991). Anaerobic species most commonly isolated include Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium sp. (Sweeney et al . 1991). The survival rate for horses with aerobic bacterial infections is higher than that ofhorses with anaerobic or mixed aerobic and anaerobicinfections and may be affected, in part, by the presence and severity of sepsis (Sweeney et al . 1985, 1991). Metritis Septic metritis in horses is usually secondary to retained fetal membranes, with ascending bacterial infection occurringhours to days after parturition (Hudson et al . 2005). Risk factors for retention of fetal membranes include mare age(Provencher et al . 1988), breed (Sevinga et al . 2004), both short and long gestation (Sevinga et al . 2004), low serum calcium concentration within 12 h post partum (Sevinga et al . 2002) and caesarean section (Abernathy-Young et al . 2012). If bacteria are absorbed into the circulation from the infecteduterus, sepsis can result. In addition to signs of SIRS, horses withseptic metritis may also exhibit red-brown, Although contagious equigenitalis ) is a primary cause of metritis in mares, it does not typically cause systemic infection or sepsis (Erdmanet al . 2011). Diagnosis Although criteria for SIRS have not been definitively defined in veterinary medicine, several equine studies have extrapolatedthe SIRS definition from human medicine al . Borde et al . 2014). The definition of SIRS in people is based on physiological parameters including body temperature, heartrate, respiratory rate and abnormal leucocyte count (Boneet al . 1992). The presence of 2 of the following abnormalities is considered diagnostic for SIRS: 1) Hyperthermia or neutrophils. Although these parameters are nonspecific, the SIRS criteria do not apply when other noninflammatory causes ofthese clinical signs are present, such as pain, heat stress orchemotherapy (Bone et al . 1992). However , definitive diagnosis of bacterial sepsis is obtained through microbialculture. Unfortunately, culture and antimicrobial susceptibilityresults are usually not available until more than 48 h afteradmission and consequently, empirical treatment is ofteninstituted prior to diagnosis. Early antimicrobial treatment,although warranted in suspect cases, may impede thesensitivity of culture as a diagnostic test for sepsis. In addition,false negative blood culture results may be due to lownumbers of circulating bacteria or a relatively low volume ofblood for culture and varying blood culture systems may yieldinconsistent results (Wilson and Madigan 1989). A weightedsepsis scoring system is currently used as a diagnostic tool forsepsis in neonatal foals, but demonstrates a relatively lowsensitivity and (Brewer and Koterba 1988; Corleyand Furr 2003). Although clinicopathological findings such asleucopenia, neutropenia with a degenerative left shift andneutrophil toxicity have been associated with sepsis in horses,lack of test specificity limits their usefulness in contributing to adiagnosis of sepsis (Hurcombe et al . 2008). However , with regard to predicting survival, white blood cell \u00d710 9/l) and neutrophil counts ( >4.0 \u00d7109/l) significantly associated with increased odds of survival in \u00a9 2015 EVJ Ltd101 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015septic foals (Gayle et al . 1998). Elevated plasma fibrinogen has been associated with in utero infection and is associated with nonsurvival, but is also a nonspecific indicator of inflammation(Koterba et al . 1984). Hyperfibrinogenaemia was observed in 89% of neonatal foals with confirmed meningoencephalitis(Viu et al . 2012). Increased blood L-lactate concentration and persistence of hyperlactataemia are associated withnonsurvival in horses with systemic illness, but a clearassociation with bacteraemia is lacking (Castagnetti et al . 2010). Evaluation of blood L-lactate concentration at a singletime point is a poor predictor of sepsis (Borchers et al . 2012), but is consistently elevated in foals with meningoencephalitis(Viu et al . 2012). Cytokine profiles in septic horses have varied widely among studies and are not currently utilised fordiagnosis or prognostication of equine sepsis in . et al . 2009; Castagnetti et al . 2012). In recent years, biological laboratory markers (biomarkers) have become important in diagnosing sepsis, guidingantimicrobial therapy and assessing response to therapy inhuman medicine (Mussap et al . 2013). Over 170 different compounds have been tested as potential biomarkers inhuman sepsis and biomarker development is an ongoing areaof research within the global sepsis field (Pierrakos and Vincent2010). Proteins recently investigated for their potential use asbiomarkers for sepsis include include serum amyloid A (SAA),C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin (AM) and procalcitonin (PCT) (Taylor2014). Serum amyloid A is a major acute phase protein in horses that rapidly increases in response to inflammation (Chavatteet al . 1992). There is evidence that infections are particularly effective in inducing a strong SAA response, suggesting thatSAA concentration may be useful in distinguishing infectiousfrom noninfectious disease (Pepys et Kjelgaard-Hansen and Jacobsen 2011). Serum amyloid Ahas been advocated as a useful biomarker in the diagnosis ofequine neonatal sepsis, but periparturient influenceSAA 2008). Initial in neonatal foals suggest that quantification of SAA candifferentiate infectious from illness (Chavatteet al . 1992; Stoneham et al . 2001). Concentrations of SAA have been shown to be increased in adult horses with bacterialpneumonia, influenza and septic arthritis (Hulten et al . 1999; Hulten and Demmers 2002; Jacobsen et al . 2006). In one study, clinically abnormal adult horses demonstrated a 20.5-foldincrease in median SAA compared to a relatively low ( <2-fold) increase in median WBC count and median plasma fibrinogenconcentration (Belgrave et al . 2013). Increased concentrations of SAA have been documented in mares with experimentally-induced endometritis, with serum concentrations correlatingwell al 2010; Coutinho da Silva et al . 2013). C-reactive protein is a well established biomarker of infection and inflammation in human sepsis (Keshet et al . 2009; Hofer et al . 2012). During the acute phase response to bacterial infection in people, serum CRP concentrationincreases within hours and can reach 1000-fold levels (Hoferet al . 2012). Levels remain elevated during persistent infection and then decrease rapidly (Vigushin et al . 1993). In man, serum CRP concentration may increase with many noninfectiousinflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, acutemyocardial infarction and pancreatitis (Vincent et al . 2011). A recent study evaluating plasma CRP concentrations in 40septic, 40 sick nonseptic and 39 healthy control foals failed todemonstrate an increase in any group (Taylor et al . 2013). The accuracy of a single measurement for diagnosis of sepsisvaries widely, with the ideal timepoint for measurement andpeak levels in horses unknown (Pourcyrous et . 1993; Laborada et al . 2003). Serum CRP concentrations have not been shown to increase in adult horses with recurrent airwayobstruction or exercise-induced inflammation (Cywinska et al . 2012; Lavoie-Lamoureux et al . 2012) and CRP has not been evaluated in adult horses with sepsis. Haptoglobin is a protein produced in the liver and functions to bind free haemoglobin following intravascular haemolysis.Serum Hp concentrations have been shown to decreasefollowing haemolysis and increase following acuteinflammation in several species, including horses (Eurell et al . 1993; Hulten et al . 2002). In a human study, bacteraemic patients had higher serum Hp concentrations compared topatients without infection, suggesting that serum Hpconcentration may have clinical utility in the diagnosis of sepsis(Chavez-Bueno et al . 2011). A recent study investigating the acute phase response in critically ill neonatal foals found that 40septic foals exhibited significantly lower plasma Hpconcentrations than 37 healthy foals, but there was noevidence of increased haemolysis in the septic group(Zabrecky et al . 2013). In adult horses, serum Hp concentrations have been shown to increase after elective and nonelectivesurgery and in horses affected with recurrent airway obstruction(Pollock et al . 2005; Lavoie-Lamoureux et al . 2012). Membrane-bound CD14 is found on the surface of monocytes and macrophages. Binding of CD14 to theLPS/LPS-binding protein complex activation of TLR4,which of proinflammatory cytokines. Asoluble form can be found in serum and isthought to be a product of membrane-bound CD14 releasedfrom cell surfaces (Bazil et al . 1986; Wagner et al . 2013). Soluble CD14 can bind circulating LPS and transfer LPS to plasmalipoproteins, thereby serving as an anti-inflammatory protein(Kitchens and Thompson 2005). Elevated serumconcentrations of sCD14 have been reported in man withacute inflammation and sepsis and are likely a reflection ofLPS-induced cell activation (Kitchens et al . 2001). In one study, sCD14 was found to be elevated in serum of 15 septic foalscompared to 15 healthy foals (Wagner et al . 2013). In a second study, sCD14 was found to be significantly increased inserum from 55 adult horses with diseases commonly associatedwith endotoxaemia compared to 23 healthy controls;however , sCD14 concentrations not correlate withoutcome (Silva et al . 2013). Adrenomedullin is a circulating hormone synthesised by the adrenal medulla, endothelial cells 1993; Hinson et al . 2000). This potent vasodilatoryand inotropic effects (Nishikimi et al . 2003; Gibbons et al . 2007) and has been shown to increase rapidly following the onset ofsepsis in man and rodents (Wang et al . 1998; Koo et al . 2001). Adrenomedullin is thought to contribute to hyperdynamiccirculation characterised by decreased mean arterial bloodpressure, decreased systemic vascular resistance andcompensatory increases in cardiac output and stroke volume(Wang et al . 1998; Koo et al . 2001). In man, plasma AM levels increase with various clinical diseases, with up to 50-fold \u00a9 2015 EVJ Ltd102 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015increases observed in septic patients (Ueda et al . 1999; Gibbons et al . 2007; Oncel et al . 2012). Although AM has not been evaluated in adult horses, a recent study investigatedplasma AM concentration in 3 groups of neonatal foals: septic,sick nonseptic and healthy controls (Toth et al . 2014). Ninety critically ill foals (42 septic, 48 sick nonseptic) and 61 healthyfoals were included in the study. There was a 6-fold increase inthe median plasma AM concentration in critically ill foalscompared to healthy foals (P <0.0001), but AM levels were not associated with sepsis (P = 0.71) or survival (P = 0.051). PlasmaAM concentrations of 0.041 ng/ml provided a test sensitivity of91% and specificity of 54% to predict illness, suggesting thatplasma AM concentration may serve as a marker of health infoals. In human medicine, serum procalcitonin concentrations are increased in patients with sepsis and are particularly usefulin distinguishing bacterial sepsis from other forms of infection(Aikawa et al . 2005). Elevated serum PCT concentrations can be observed with noninfectious inflammatory diseases, butstudies in man suggest that PCT is a more reliable marker ofsepsis than CRP (Luzzani et al . 2003). To date, PCT concentrations in veterinary species have not been useful inthe diagnosis of sepsis. A study investigating the expression ofmolecular markers in blood of neonatal foals with sepsis foundno difference in PCT between 21 healthy foals and 49 sick foals(Pusterla et al . 2006). Other diagnostic tests in neonatal foals include ultrasonography of the umbilicus, since external umbilicalstructures may appear normal even in foals with abscessedumbilical remnants, and thoracic imaging if septic pneumoniais suspected. Other tests may be required based on themanifestation of sepsis in an individual patient. For example,CSF cytology and culture are indicated in neonatal foals withsuspected while joint fluid cytology andculture foals with suspected septic arthritis.Blood or faecal PCR are indicated horses with suspectedequine neorickettsiosis and anaerobic faecal culture andanalysis may enterocolitis and/or salmonellosis are suspected.Finally, tracheal fluid culture are indicatedin horses with pleuropneumonia and culture of uterine fluidmay be warranted in cases of suspected metritis. To summarise, definitive diagnosis of sepsis requires detection of the clinical parameters of SIRS as well asconfirmation of bacterial infection. Given the high risk ofbacteraemia in neonatal foals, blood cultures are performedroutinely and positive results often confirm a diagnosis of sepsis.In mature horses (and occasionally in neonatal foals), thepresence of SIRS in addition to isolation of bacteria from alocal infection are used to diagnose sepsis. Due to theinsensitivity of microbial culture, the presence of SIRS and astrong suspicion of infection may justify a diagnosis of sepsis. Treatment Treatment of sepsis requires an intensive care approach thatincludes antimicrobial drug administration, fluid resuscitationand blood pressure support, and treatment for inflammation,endotoxaemia and coagulopathy. Early recognition ofsepsis and prompt antimicrobial drug treatment are critical fora successful outcome. Initially, a broad-spectrum bactericidalapproach should be based on prediction of likely organisms(given the hospital or region's recent history) and shouldnot be delayed pending microbial culture results if there is ahigh suspicion of sepsis. Based on several antimicrobial sensitivity studies in foals with bacteraemia, the currentrecommendation for empirical treatment of suspectedneonatal foal sepsis a of an 2005; Theelen et al . 2014a). Targeted therapy should be implemented based on sensitivity results typicallyavailable 4-7 days after submission. Aminoglycosides shouldbe avoided or enrofloxacin: 5-7 mg/kg per os or i.v. q. 24 h) should be reserved for those cases with resistance toother antimicrobials given the risk of arthropathy (Davenportet al . 2001). Appropriate antimicrobial treatment of sepsis in mature horses is based on culture and antimicrobialsusceptibility in cases of horses suspected ofhaving equine neorickettsiosis (Bertin et al . 2013). Horses colitis or salmonellosis are typicallynot treated with antimicrobials, but this may be necessary insevere cases in order to prevent bacterial translocation andsubsequent bacteraemia. Fluid therapy is an important component of therapy for horses with hypovolaemia, hypotension, septic shock, oracid/base/electrolyte disorders. Initial choices include acombination crystalloids of choice since FPT is not anuncommon finding in septic foals, and can also be used toaddress low colloidal oncotic pressure and hypovolaemia.Equine plasma specifically enriched with anti-endotoxinantibodies has been shown to increase survival in sickneonatal foals compared to foals receiving hyperimmuneequine plasma (Peek et al . 2006). Due to the relatively high cost of plasma (currently $150/l), synthetic colloids may be the only affordable choice for some owners. It is important tonote, however , that hydroxyethyl starches are no longerrecommended for treatment of sepsis in man due to increasedrenal adverse effects and some studies indicating an increasein mortality (Perner et al . 2012; Mutter et al . 2013). For horses that present in septic shock, fluids should be administered initially at a 'shock dose' (20 ml/kg bwt) bolusover 30 min and may need to be repeated 1-2 timesdepending on response to therapy. Once normovolaemia isachieved, a maintenance fluid rate of 60-100 ml/kg bwt/dayis typically adequate to maintain hydration, although this mayneed to be adjusted for ongoing losses in some cases. Duringfluid therapy, it is important to monitor for clinical signs ofoedema, urine output, vital signs and extremity temperature.Clinicopathological values that should be routinely monitoredin neonatal foals include blood glucose, arterial blood gasanalysis and electrolyte concentrations. Special considerations in neonatal foals include the importance of reassessment and care to preventoverhydration. In addition, supplementation of isotoniccrystalloids with dextrose is since many \u00a9 2015 EVJ Ltd103 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / hypoglycaemia. Judicious monitoring of bloodglucose dextrose important, asmany foals glucose concentrations <2.8 mmol/l or >10 mmol/l were less likely to survive in one study, highlighting theimportance of maintaining euglycaemia in critically ill foals(Hollis et al . 2008a). If multiple boluses of i.v. fluids are not successful in restoring tissue perfusion, inopressor therapy should beinitiated. The drugs used supportperfusion are dobutamine agood first choice and 5 g/kg bwt/min is a reasonable starting point for horses not in septic shock. For those with evidence ofshock, up to 15 g/kg bwt/min may be used. The other adrenergic agonists may be tried if dobutamine isunsuccessful. It is important to remember that the goal oftherapy is to return perfusion to minimally acceptable levelsand not to try to achieve normal perfusion. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are important to to phenylbutazone, flunixinmeglumine at 0.25 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 8 h has been shown to bemore effective in controlling inflammation associated withendotoxin in adult horses, but studies in foals are lacking(Semrad et al . 1987). Adverse effects such as gastroduodenal ulceration and renal papillary necrosis may occur , especially indehydrated animals, so caution should be used whenadministering these drugs. Steroid use in sepsis is controversial. It is well accepted in human medicine that high doses of corticosteroidsare contraindicated in patients with sepsis and thatdexamethasone leads to harmfully prolonged suppression al . 2011). Hydrocortisone therapy at low to moderate doses is currently recommended for septic shock inselected human patients (Marik et al . 2008). There is some evidence that neonatal foals exhibit cortisol insufficiency incritical illness, but recent studies demonstrate the lack ofunderstanding of the HPA axis in septic horses (Hart et al . 2009, 2011, 2012). Thus, to date, there is no evidence from which tomake recommendations regarding corticosteroid use in septichorses. Polymyxin B is a peptide antimicrobial drug that exhibits anti-endotoxin effects by directly binding to the lipid A portionof LPS (Morrison and Jacobs 1976). In an ex vivo model of endotoxaemia, polymyxin B was found to inhibit TNF activity from LPS-stimulated monocytes (Parviainen et al . 2001). In vivo studies have shown beneficial effects of polymyxin B afterexperimental induction of endotoxaemia in foals and adults,supporting its use in clinical cases (Barton et al . 2004; Wong et al . 2013). Caution must be used in horses with hypovolaemia or concurrent kidney disease given the potentially nephrotoxicproperties of the drug. The recommended dosage forpolymyxin B u/kg bwt q. of pyruvate that exerts anti-inflammatory effects by blocking binding of DNA to NF and inhibiting expression of proinflammatory cytokines (Fink2003; Mizutani et al . 2011). In adult horses, EP has been shown to inhibit clinical signs of endotoxaemia and decreaseproinflammatory gene expression following LPS infusion, without adverse effects (Cook et al . 2011; Schroeder et al . 2011; Jacobs et al . 2012). Although EP may have therapeutic application in endotoxaemic horses, it has not been tested inclinical cases and is not currently available in a clinical setting. Anti-gastroduodenal ulcer drugs may be used in adult horses that are considered high-risk for gastric ulceration dueto stress or anorexia. Septic adult horses may benefit fromanti-ulcer medications, which should be recommended on anindividual basis. The use of these drugs is controversial in septicneonatal foals. Recent reports suggest that these medicationsdo not significantly decrease risk of ulcer formation and mayincrease the risk of diarrhoea (Elfenbein ulcer prophylaxis in foals should be instituted on an individual basis. Other treatments depend on prevailing circumstances for each individual case and may include intranasal oxygeninsufflation and surgical treatment of septic joints or umbilicalinfections. Bronchodilators such as albuterol (720 g q. 4-6 h, inhaler) may be useful in horses with septic pleuropneumonia.Systemic low dose corticosteroid treatment may be beneficialin modulating SIRS in septic horses, but further studies arewarranted before specific recommendations can be made(Hart and Barton 2011). Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) Dysfunction of 2 or more organs as a sequela to sepsis or septicshock is defined as MODS. Although it may not be appropriateto classify the hoof as an 'organ,' it is reasonable to includelaminitis in the MODS criteria given that widespreadinflammation and coagulation disorders that lead to MODS inpatients with sepsis/septic shock also lead to al . 2013). Similar to SIRS criteria, MODS criteria have not been validated in thehorse. Extrapolation from human medicine (with the exceptionof laminitis) defines MODS as dysfunction of 2 or more of thefollowing systems: laminitis, haemostatic, neurological, . 1992). Laminitis and haemostatic dysfunction (coagulopathies) will be discussed further. Laminitis In adult horses, one of the most devastating complications ofsepsis is the development of acute laminitis. In a retrospectivestudy comparing 73 hospitalised horses that developedlaminitis with 146 that did not, the diagnosis of endotoxaemiawas found to be the only factor significantly associated withlaminitis (Parsons et al . 2007). Although hypoxia and laminar microthrombi formation are suspected to be involved in thepathophysiology of endotoxin-mediated laminitis, severalattempts to induce laminitis by experimental infusion of LPShave not been successful (Turek et al . 1985; Tadros and Frank 2012). Laminitis may also be induced by hyperglycaemia andhyperinsulinaemia (insulin resistance) (de Laat et al . 2012; Knowles et al . 2012). In a retrospective analysis of 44 horses diagnosed with equine neorickettsiosis, laminitis was present in38% of horses, 88% of which were affected in all 4 feet (Bertinet al . 2013). Prophylactic treatment with digital hypothermia has been shown to decrease the incidence of laminitis in \u00a9 2015 EVJ Ltd104 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2015horses with colitis and may improve outcome in horses with other forms of sepsis (Kullmann et al . 2013). Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) A consequence of sepsis is coagulation abnormalities, which can be dynamic and complicated. Systemic inflammationassociated with sepsis can cause widespread damageto the endothelium, which promotes coagulation. Thishypercoagulable state can lead to microthrombi formation,ischaemia and MODS (Taylor et al . 2001). As coagulation factors are consumed, the patient enters a hypocoagulablephase characterised by excessive bleeding (Epstein 2014). Inhuman patients with sepsis, administration of heparin isrecommended for those patients in a hypercoagulable state(Zimmerman 2004). Heparin has been shown to decrease theincidence of laminitis and increase survival in adult horses withhypercoagulable DIC, but heparin may increase bleeding inthe hypocoagulable state; thus, its use in sepsis is controversialas these states may not be easily decipherable (Welch et al . 1992; Cohen et al . 1994). Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; dalteparin) has reportedly fewer side effects thanunfractionated heparin in horses, with the recommendeddosage of 50 iu/kg bwt q. 24 h SC (Feige et al . 2003). The incidence of DIC in septic foals can reach up to 50% and isassociated with nonsurvival (Armengou et foals higher dosage of LMWH thanadults to achieve anticoagulant activity blood levels anddosing at 100 iu/kg bwt q. 24 h subcutaneously appeared safein a clinical study (Armengou et al . 2010). Hyperimmune equine plasma containing coagulation factors may bebeneficial in treating or preventing the hypocoagulable stateof DIC (Welch et al . 1992). In both neonatal and mature horses, treatment of the underlying disease is the most importanttherapy for DIC. Prognosis Since sepsis is a common, 'stand alone' diagnosis in neonatalfoals, several studies have documented outcome. Survivalrates in septic neonatal foals are highly variable, with reportedshort-term survival rates from 10 to 70% (Baker et al . 1986; Hoffman et al . et al . 2002; Slack Peek et 2006; Corley et al . 2007). However , outcome has improved significantly over time, which is likely due to early detection and treatment of atrisk foals. In general, it is appropriate to quote a prognosis forshort-term survival of approximately 50-60%, but individualfactors will greatly influence the outcome. Foals withGram-negative or mixed organism infections are more likely todie than foals with Gram-positive infection (Barton et al . 1998; Corley et al . 2007). Odds of survival also decrease if septic arthritis is present, or if band neutrophils or serum creatinineconcentration are significantly elevated (Sanchez et al . 2008). Neonatal foals with confirmed meningoencephalitis have apoor prognosis, with one study reporting an 11% survival ratedespite aggressive treatment (Viu et al . 2012). There are few studies regarding long-term outcome in septic foals. One studyreported that Thoroughbred foals with previous neonatalbacteraemia had significantly fewer racing wins and totalearnings than siblings with no history of bacteraemia (Sanchezet al . 2008). A second study reported that the development of septic arthritis in Thoroughbred racehorses significantlydecreased the likelihood that the horse would successfullyrace (Steel et al . 1999). Survival rates in mature horses with sepsis vary considerably with the primary disease process andare not always due to sepsis itself. Thus, it is difficult toprognosticate as no studies have been done to evaluate alarge population of adult horses with the inclusion criteria ofstrictly SIRS or sepsis, regardless of the primary disease. Summary Sepsis is defined as SIRS due to infection, with bacterialinfections predominating in equine cases. Sepsis continues torepresent a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonataland mature horses. Although the word 'sepsis' has traditionallybeen used to describe bacteraemia and SIRS in neonatalfoals, it is important to recognise that sepsis also occurs inmature horses, most commonly due to infectious enterocolitis,pleuropneumonia and metritis. Diagnosis of sepsis is difficultsince SIRS criteria are nonspecific and microbial isolation andculture techniques are insensitive. Serum biomarkers arecurrently being investigated for their potential role in diagnosisand prognostication of sepsis. Successful treatment relieson rapid intervention, particularly with antimicrobial drugs totreat the primary disease, as well as hemodynamic support.The survival rate of septic neonatal foals ranges fromapproximately 30 to 85%, while outcome in mature horses withsepsis depends on the primary infection, severity of diseaseand complication rate.
