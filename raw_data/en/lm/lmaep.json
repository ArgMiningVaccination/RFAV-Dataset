Modern society has brought with it many comforts and conveniences, yet when it comes to the United States' health and nutrition, the advancements haven't always been positive for your overall health. Doing things better, cheaper and faster may work well for manufacturing microprocessors but it doesn't work well with the mind, body or spirit. The invention of factory farming, refined and processed pre-packaged food and fast food has come at a high price - your health. You can find your own way to good health by learning the basics of holistic health including what is safe and what is dangerous in modern food. With knowledge comes the empowerment to debunk misnomers from food and nutrition studies born out of conflicts of interest and to see through devious marketing from large food and beverage manufacturers focused only on one thing (and it's not your health.) Consuming a diet filled with the \"food like stuff\" that has become a basic of today's Standard American Diet (SAD), results in excess weight, illness, dis-ease and mental fog from the dangerous components of our food. As an unique individual, biochemically and spiritually, it's important to find what works best for you. When you know the basics, you can seek out and find what foods, including amounts and combinations, work best for your individual body. It's vital to experiment to find the right combination of food, exercise and spiritual nurturing so you not only feel great, you are the best, most dazzling version of you. Empowerment through knowledge will allow you to find your own way to a life of vibrant health and a trim, healthy body. Awareness of good nutrition is freedom from fad diets, counting calories and points, reading unhelpful nutritional labels and from confusion over misleading nutritional information in the media. Changing what you know and the way you eat and treat your mind, body and spirit will transform your life. Human Dietetics 2019 Can obesity, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, cancer and other cardiovascular diseases be prevented and reversed? Absolutely! How so? Very simple, just put out the oxygen that keeps the flame of these diseases burning! Simply put, these modern 'lifestyle' diseases, as they are commonly called, are not so much obtained genetically or through heredity as they are obtained through a perverted eating lifestyle and habit. The genes you now have were obtained from your parents, who also obtained theirs from their parents. However, it beats the imagination that such diseases were not common in previous and earlier centuries. So, if it is hereditary, why are they surfacing now? Why did they not occur in our earlier ancestors? The answer is simple: their lifestyles were different from ours and the problem is not with our genes, but with our diet and sedentary habits. Many people have been able to manage and reverse their cardiovascular conditions through radical, and on some occasions, gradual, dietary changes. You might wonder, why do medical science and the greatest physicians not know this? Again, the answer is simple: medical science is not healthcare, it is disease care! Medicine is not supposed to heal the healthy, but the sick. It is based on three main arms: drugs/medicines (chemotherapy), surgery, and radiation. If your disease cannot be treated by any of these three arms, then medical science cannot help you! In addition, physicians by their training cannot go outside these three arms of medicine to provide alternative healthcare. Physicians are not dietitians and they only prescribe drugs, not diet. And even dietitians and their standard dietetic recommendations, have failed to save their patients from these diseases. In this brief diet plan for health, the author presents a background to good and sound health and suggests the simple foods that can secure a disease-free life. That all may read and be able to apply these healthy principles for a sound and enduring health is the utmost aim of the Author. 2008 In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto is a 2008 book by journalist and activist Michael Pollan.
