There are certainly some of them that buy in to the woo bullshit of Dog Autism. I had to cut contact with someone that was way way way to into all of this stuff after studying how to be an MRI tech. Like she was smart enough, she just had no common sense. Also torture small animals for fun if they have a chance. Actually, cats want a fair bit of attention, whatever dog-owners think, they're just not licking your boots constantly. In fact they probably think you should lick their fur, bad staff.Every cat I encountered that had \"deficits in social communication and social interaction\" turned out to simply be picky with who they wanted to interact with. They overwhelmingly avoided assholes, despite being cared for by said assholes. As for repetitive actions, they eat, they groom, they shit, they sleep. Not sure how you can mix that up. Or slavery. You gain valuable skills that way. /sLack of quality education. Provide quality education. \"If cats looked like frogs we'd realize what nasty, cruel little bastards they are. Style. That's what people remember.\"Also torture small animals for fun if they have a chance. Actually, cats want a fair bit of attention, whatever dog-owners think, they're just not licking your boots constantly. In fact they probably think you should lick their fur, bad staff. Humans often act, then retroactively create a plausible motivation for the action.It is classic projection. Somewhere down the road evolution decided this was a reflex that was worth keeping. Then a bit further, evolution decided to give us higher order executive functions to inhibit these reflexes. But that part is not as strong as we pretend it to be. We're all idiots 90% of our time. It is not something the US has a monopoly on. It is just a lot easier to see in other people. For ourselves? We burry it under a thick warm comforting blanket of rationalisations. Brief summary of a course I once took. Difference between dogs and cats:\"If cats looked like frogs we'd realize what nasty, cruel little bastards they are. Style. That's what people remember.\" Terry Pratchett, Lords and Ladies Difference between dogs and cats: Your dog thinks, Wow! You feed me, give me shelter, play with me, and make sure I'm happy and healthy. You must be a god! Your cat thinks, Wow! You feed me, give me shelter, play with me, and make sure I'm happy and healthy. I must be a god! Oh no, our dumb one does that too. Will eat carpet, leaves, poop, etc. But the pills? No, those are not good.lol. And here my dog is carefully eating around any pills you try to sneak into his treats and spits them out. This even though he's a glutton that'll eat any old food the neighbors throw in their yard or sidewalk. If 37% believe in Dog Autism and are willing to stop rabies vaccines and allow terrible diseases to spread after immunity levels drop, then you made the conclusion, not the author. The willingness to adopt and support studies that are weak and poorly support or outright fraud is not going to harbinger good things for overall disease control levels across man and beast.So you're saying 37% of dog owners are dumb and lack critical thinking skills. Got it. Help me out. What does the \"D\" inAutism isn't a mental illness, nor is it a disorder. Help me out. What does the \"D\" in [ASD]stand for? You think is more of a development disorder kind of thing?Autism isn't a mental illness, nor is it a disorder. The reason you're getting so much pushback is because you're being offensive. I'll take the bait... What lie? That's a fairly bold/hyperbolic statement. I provided a link to a study for an individual to read, perhaps understand, then draw their own conclusion. As far as I know, yes - my Autism & ADHD diagnosis paperwork very clearly describes it as developmental. But, I do very much agree that there's a big difference between my own personal \"apparently light enough that many people refuse to believe I even have it\" and the \"Rain Man would be easier\" of some - It's a spectrum, after all.You think is more of a development disorder kind of thing? Anyone with seriously autistic children could attest to validity of such claims, with an added punch on the nose if they're non-verbal. Mine are fortunately \"high-functioning\", albeit we were (rather pleasantly) surprised when my son started talking at age five. Fuckin' beautifulBold added by me. This isn't the account that posted the link. You sock puppeting? Cool story, bro, what's a \"V?\" A vaccine? A virus? A vortex? A vagina?The Vs It's been that way for a long time. You have the ability for that group to be noisier more than they have ever been, creating the air they are a \"new phenomena\". They are not. Just finding whatever new weird thing to get all worked up over. Even during WW2 you had a handful of idiots supporting the Nazis, irrespective of nation. Typically, it has to do with \"being in the know\" so they get a sense of supremacy over others. The sort that exist for that one time they were right about something everyone called them crazy for beleiving. It doesn't have political bounds, generally they fall with whoever will promote their snake oil. Crystal healers and horse paste gourmets...37% is higher than I expected, normally this would match the base crazy rate of 27-30% ( [as kungfumonkey documented in the Bush years]). This 30% is remarkably consistent - Trump voters, anti-vaxxers, all the nutso theories in the body politic today get that level of support. Of all the articles I'd expect to see someone going through the bother of sock puppeting, dog vaccine/autism is the least.Bold added by me. This isn't the account that posted the link. You sock puppeting? Bold added by me. This isn't the account that posted the link. You sock puppeting? They actually changed their name We've spent centuries ignoring them, and they're still here, so the best thing to do is exactly what we've been doing for centuries even though it hasn't fixed the problem...It's been that way for a long time.

Honestly, this lot simply makes for a scapegoat that modern politics is willing to try and leverage. The issue is that is exactly how these idiots spread. But since when have politicians cared? It gets clicks and gets talking heads talking, so slap your logo on it and hope it rakes in some votes! They have to be ignored. That's how they were dealt with for centuries prior. You still had the neighbor convinced the CIA was hiding in the telephone pole, so you just ignored them. You don't go to town insisting everyone hear about the crazy guy thinking the telephone poles are CIA stations... thats how you get more idiots believing it. Just when I think humanity cannot slip further into the abyss of ignorance by choice, I read this article. How has our education system failed so many folks so badly? Incorrect. We now give them top billing, entire news segments, and turned them into a \"cultural item\". While most point and laugh, these idiots only care about the ones that ask \"could it be though?\". Giving them a platform is precisely why they have become a issue. You cannot get rid of them. Not unless we keep going down the route of \"punishing the entire class because that one weird kid keeps eating glue and shoving markers up their nose for \"reasons beyond our mortal understanding\"\".We've spent centuries ignoring them, and they're still here, so the best thing to do is exactly what we've been doing for centuries even though it hasn't fixed the problem... A lot of dog are just plain dumb, how do you tell if a dog has autism. Damn, Elon has autism.I dont even....no, just no. This is too stupid for words..dog autism. Is there a large overlap with Trump supporters by any chance because that could explain a lot, Don't generalize. I have a lab who adores being touched anywhere, anytime. Paws, tail, hindquarters, it's all good.I don't know any animal that likes their front paws being handled... I've had a GSD for the last ten years and I've never heard of dog autism. My dog is slow to react to some things, like even if I ask him if he's hungry he seems clueless. Say the word CAT and he's into action instantly.I just wonder if the study was multiple choice. It could be that the respondents are only worried about canine autism because they saw/heard it on the list and assumed it had to be real, so now they are concerned? Still, I have a hard time believing that alone would bring the percentage to 37%. If it wasn't a listed option but the respondents came up with it themselves, I'd be extra worried. How To Spot An AntiVax Troll 101:Clearly an unpopular opinion here but since were all 'science-y' apparently, have a look at some data. [...] Again, not anti-vaxx for me or my dog. My COVID punch card is and has always been maxed. I am however not prepared to simply take whatever is said in a vet's office as gospel not to be questioned. It's 'healthy' to take a brief moment to understand the what and the why in regards to foreign matter that is being injected into you or your loved one's body. Even if there were dogs that have autism, it's likely that the worst off would be disabled to the point that they couldn't feed and they'd die off. Humans are much more capable of supporting babies with problems.Cite your source then, because I'm not just taking your word over the word of a veterinarian quoted in an article by a science journalist as saying it's not a diagnosis that exists in veterinary medicine. It's not that i don't think dogs can suffer mental disorders. It's that you are in disagreement with actual experts over whether this particular human mental disorder exists in dogs, and have provided zero evidence. Lacking that, I'll side with the experts. you're right dogs don't have ASM but apparently they can have canine dysfunctional behavior (CDB).Imagine thinking dog autism (which does not exist) is worse than rabies.. This is NOT how you get a Left4Dead scenario, but you're on the right track: I bet a lot conservative anti-vaxxers DO imagine themselves the hero of their own apocalypse fantasy, where they lord it over their followers in their compound in the woods, shoot anything that comes near, and the rest of the world can go to hell. It's not autism, but it sure is antisocial.C'mon, dog owners. Do you really want a Left4Dead scenario? Because this is how you get a Left4Dead scenario. "}
