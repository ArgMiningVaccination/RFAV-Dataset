The increase is attributed mainly to white adults in their 20s and 30s who live in non-urban areas. In many cases, these people were addicted to prescription drugs but then switched to intravenous opioid abuse, which has a much higher risk of infection.5 Transmission From Drug Use Symptoms Treatment Treating Addiction In addition, [if you have hepatitis and inject drugs, you should consider addiction treatment](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/adult-addiction-treatment-programs). You can minimize the risks of additional hepatitis contraction (and other health problems) from continued IV drug use. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is effective for treating opioid addiction. You can even undergo MAT if you take antiviral medication. MAT combines counseling and the use of medications, such as buprenorphine and methadone, to address opioid withdrawal symptoms and treat opioid addiction. Medications help normalize your brain chemistry, block the euphoric sensations associated with opioid abuse so you are less likely to use, and alleviate cravings. Counseling helps to address the underlying issues that may have led to or contributed to your addiction and provides you with the tools you'll need to live a healthier, drug-free life.9 Tips for Preventing Hepatitis Testing and Vaccinations If you use intravenous drugs, you should think about getting tested for hepatitis.

It can also be given in a series of 4 injections: the initial dose, and then doses that occur after 7 days, 21 to 30 days, and one year.13 What if I Have Hepatitis?
