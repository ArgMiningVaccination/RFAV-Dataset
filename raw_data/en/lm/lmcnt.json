It is uniquely designed to help you sit cross legged. - Shaped to support knees, ankles and hips. - Filled with 4.5 pounds of clean, US grown, 100% organic buckwheat hulls (most other buckwheat cushions are not organic, and all the residual chemicals compound in your meditation room!). -You can add or take out the amount of buckwheat to adjust to your needs to make the seat height perfect for ourself. This process is made easy with a zipper and inner bag. - The pillow cases are made from 100% hand spun and hand woven, vegetable dyed and very durable Khadi cotton from India. - The top cushion cover has a large zipper that makes it very easy for washing. It can be hand washed (or delicate cycle) in cold water with mild detergent and line dried. - The wide seat enables you to sit fully on top of the cushion and the buckwheat hulls move around enough to conform to the shape of your unique body and provide a very grounding feeling that is helpful for meditation. - Our 100% wool Asana Meditation Mats are perfect to place under this cushion. This cushion is designed by us at Supreme Swan. The covers are handmade in India and filled with organic buckwheat hulls from the USA. All cushions have a 14 day limit for returns. *This cushion is not intended for medical therapy or treatment. "}
