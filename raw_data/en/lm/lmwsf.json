While the study of acupuncture is complex, practitioners focus on stabilizing the pathways of the Qi which flows through various vessels in the body. It is believed that when these vessels become unbalanced, the cells, organs, and tissues within the body are deprived of their necessary nutrition and other vital substances. Unless these disruptions are corrected in a timely matter, the affected area of the body often becomes diseased or even dies. Conversely, if these vessels are opened up and remain open, normal function in the body can be restored. In fact, many patients report a reduction or absence of symptoms such as pain, tiredness, and nausea immediately upon receiving their first acupuncture treatment. While the Western doctor views the human body mechanically as a machine that needs to be fixed, the Eastern doctor views the human body as a dynamic organism that is capable of thriving when it is in a balanced state. Thus the Western doctor is like a mechanic and the Eastern doctor is like a farmer. Plants cannot be made to grow, rather the correct environment is created so the plants can thrive. The Benefits of Chiropractic Care No one should suffer constantly from pain stemming from preexisting conditions or injuries that never seem to heal. Chiropractic care can help patients dealing with a myriad of health problems find lasting relief. Most healthy people do not realize that chiropractic care can even be beneficial for improving their immune system function and strengthening their vitality. Day-to-day life can be draining not just on the mind, but the immune system. By seeking wellness care at our clinic, minor adjustments can ensure your body stays running like a finely-tuned machine, ready to conquer every day's challenges. WHAT CAN ACUPUNCTURE HELP WITH? The chronic problems we face with our health have three underlying causes. The first is emotional stress. Stress can create imbalance at several levels in our bodies including in our hormones and neurotransmitters which impacts our endocrine and nervous systems. This can impact any organ system or muscle group in our bodies. The second problem is trauma. Traumas occur throughout our life and their effect of them accumulates with time. If the healing from trauma is interrupted, complete healing might never occur causing a chronic problem. The third problem is toxicity. Unfortunately, we live in a toxic environment. Worse than that, many of us have habits or lifestyles in which we expose ourselves to even more toxins. In any case, toxicity leads to the malfunction of our bodies which robs us of our health. With repeated exposure to stress, trauma, and toxins, it is easy to understand how our body's natural state becomes disrupted. While many health care professionals resort to chemical prescription drugs and surgery to treat the symptoms that result from the imbalances, acupuncturists focus on restoring the flow of vital substances and helping the body to heal naturally. \"You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them. If you cannot make a change, change the way you have been thinking.\" Maya Angelou \"While other professions are concerned with changing the environment to suit the weakened body, chiropractic is concerned with strengthening the body to suit the environment.\" B.J.
