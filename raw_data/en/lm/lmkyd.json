Our determination to improve public health motivates us to develop new vaccines to address still unmet medical needs. Fueled by new data and digital technologies, our science and manufacturing have the potential to transform the practice of medicine for millions of people around the world. And when we discover the extraordinary, we're already planning where to go next. Because everyone deserves a chance to plan for their future, to dream big. Protecting public health with innovative vaccines I was not vaccinated, so I was unprotected against meningitis. Now, as a national ambassador of the Spanish Association Against Meningitis, my advice is to vaccinate against this terrible disease. Davide's Story Davide is an inspirational athlete and meningitis survivor. He shares his story to help raise awareness about prevention of this potentially devastating infection. 34Giving birth was, in fact, the making of the real me. I found it empowering, despite even going through a miscarriage. I realized that sense of empowerment in childbirth was integral to my goal of happiness. So, I changed careers, left my job as a journalist in London, and focused on helping other parents feel empowered by their birth experiences. My dream is that all new parents go into a birth informed and educated so that they make the right decisions for them. Georgia, UKVaccines help defend us from diseases and let us focus on a future filled with hope. They give us the chance to appreciate the little things that make our day, and dream about the big ones that rock our world. Countless people protected. Countless dreams pursued.Dream Big, vaccines protect us5Sanofi's vaccines in numbers From helping to prevent infectious diseases at every stage of life, to protecting humanity against emerging epidemics, vaccines help to create and maintain healthy communities that keep life moving forward.We supply millions of vaccine doses for nearly a dozen diseases every day, making it possible to vaccinate over half a billion people worldwide, each year . Paul Hudson Chief Executive OfficerThomas Triomphe Executive Vice President, Vaccines We are a worldwide leader in human vaccines1: 500 million people vaccinated annually with our vaccines, worldwide 2.5 million vaccine doses supplied, every day6.3 billion \u20ac in sales in 2021, representing +6.8% sales growth 500 million \u20ac invested in vaccines R&D each year A world leader in influenza and pediatric vaccines375 million polio vaccine doses supplied to UNICEF since 201412 vaccine manufacturing sites in 8 countries Our vaccines are available in about 150 countriesCosmos Okoli - Polio survivorWe are the leader in pediatric combination vaccines, including 6-in-1 hexavalent shots that help protect against diphteria, tetanus, polio, pertussis, Hib and hepatitis b. We provide booster vaccines for children, adolescents and adults, extending protection against several life-threatening diseases throughout life. We also developed the first pertussis vaccine indicated in pregnancy for the prevention of pertussis in young children. We are the leader in influenza vaccines: our portfolio includes vaccines that can help protect against flu but also against its potential complications such as heart attacks2. We provide vaccines to help protect against meningococcal meningitis, a bacterial infection which can have devastating consequences in 24 to 48 hours3. And, through an innovative global partnership, we offer a protective option for infants against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) a common respiratory disease which is a leading cause of hospitalization in children under one year of age4,5.Our immunization portfolio Infectious diseases we offer protection against: Viruses Bacterial Infections I survived Polio when I was four years old... If a vaccine had been available, I would have been vaccinated. I don't want to see any child with polio deformities. It hurts me because it shouldn't happen, as there is a way to stop it. 6Our technologies We use a wide range of tools to develop vaccines that can target proteins, sugars (polysaccharides), or other features that enable viruses and bacteria to thrive in the human body. We are developing vaccines by leveraging different technologies: Inactivated vaccines Inactivated vaccines use the killed version of the germ that causes a disease. Ex.: Polio, rabies, influenza Polysaccharide-based vaccines Some disease-causing bacteria have a coating made of polysaccharides (sugars) that protects them from being seen and destroyed by cells in our immune system. Using one of these sugars in the vaccine alerts the body to kill the bacteria. Ex.: Typhoid Conjugated-polysaccharide vaccines To help the body remember the bacteria longer and to stimulate a better immune response in children, the sugar is linked to a protein. Ex.: Invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis (serogroups A, C, W, Y), Haemophilus influenzae type b in infants. 7Live-attenuated vaccines Some vaccines are based on weakened whole viruses, which help the body build its defenses without causing disease. Ex.: Yellow fever Nikita Khadse and Natalia Vargas - Research & Biomarkers lab - mRNA - Waltham - Massachusetts - United States8 Explain mRNA without jargon Making Vaccines 8Recombinant protein vaccines When only part of a pathogen, like a protein, is needed to create a vaccine, sometimes the right approach is to synthetize that protein using recombinant technology. This involves producing the protein in the lab and formulating it into a vaccine. Ex.: Hepatitis B and one of our influenza vaccines Monoclonal antibody Rather than stimulating the body to produce its own antibodies, we can design monoclonal antibodies that can offer protection against certain diseases. This kind of rapid protection could bridge important gaps in immunity, especially among very young infants and other at-risk populations. Ex.: RSV for infants Messenger RNA vaccines mRNA carries messages that instruct human cells to directly manufacture the antigen (e.g. a well identified protein from a virus), in the body, which stimulates the immune system to produce protective antibodies. The mRNA instructions are protected by a lipid barrier to shield it from destructive enzymes and shuttle it into cells. Ex.: Investigational vaccines for influenza, RSV for adults, chlamydia We never stop innovating. We constantly pursue progress, turning science into vaccines that help protect people and communities around the world.In all, we aim to have 10 new vaccines in clinical trials by 2025, including 6 using mRNA technologies.Our vaccine R&D We invest more than 500M \u20ac in vaccines R&D annually. Our most exciting current R&D avenues include: Investing in mRNA to accelerate the delivery of effective vaccines for stubborn pathogens: our mRNA Center of Excellence (CoE) is focused on tolerability and thermostability of next- generation mRNA vaccines. The CoE houses 400 colleagues across research sites in France and the United States, all concentrated on adapting mRNA technologies from pandemic to routine use across several different disease areas. Developing novel vaccines in areas of continued unmet need: RSV vaccines for infants, toddlers, and older adults; a pentavalent meningococcal vaccine with broad strain coverage; next- generation influenza vaccines; a pneumococcal vaccine candidate covering 21 serotypes; and next-generation rabies and yellow fever vaccines. Pioneering new areas of development, including early-stage research for first-ever vaccines against chlamydia and acne. Expanding our leadership in R&D with a full suite of development platforms designed to improve antigen design with the help of artificial intelligence and other digital technologies.

Our teams are working to develop mRNA vaccine candidates with a focus on thermostability and tolerability. Tolerability Limiting the frequency and severity of side effects. Thermostability Developing vaccines that are stable within a wide range of temperatures, making it easier to transport them over long distances and store them for longer periods of time. How does mRNA work? mRNA science has given our R&D teams more ways to develop vaccines against different infectious diseases and to keep pace with emerging health threats.Camille Firmann - Assistant Project Manager for mRNA vaccine formulation - Marcy-l'\u00c9toile - France 10Vaccines Industrial Sites Vaccines R&D Sites EVolutive Facilities (by 2025)Cambridge UNITED STATES Meriden UNITED STATES Pearl River UNITED STATES Orlando UNITED STATES Swiftwater UNITED STATESToronto CANADA Ocoyoacac MEXICO Pilar ARGENTINAVal-de-Reuil FRANCE Singapore REPUBLIC OF SINGAPOREShenzhen CHINA Chachoengsao THAILANDMarcy-L'\u00c9toile FRANCE 11 Innovate in production Our manufacturing sites are powered by big data and digital technology.
