Puchalski, George Washington University Medical Center Recording of a talk given at Harvard Medical School's Spirituality and Healing in Medicine Conference in December 2008 (1 hour). Date Last Modified 12/01/2008 Audio file (MP3, etc.), Lecture presentation | | Primary Author: Florence Gelo, Drexel University College of Medicine The Heart of Empathy video, and its accompanying Facilitator's Guide, captures Dr. Gelo's technique of using the visual arts to teach medical students and residents how to emotionally prepare for and deal with their patients' suffering and dying. As medical students and residents view the suffering portrayed in the paintings, the facilitator helps them to articulate and recognize their emotional reactions. Through focused observation and expression of feelings in a non-judgmental humanistic setting, students may cultivate the ability to acknowledge and address the emotional lives of their patients. Inspired by her experience as a Philadelphia Museum of Art tour guide, Dr. Gelo began to notice the emotional impact of paintings on the viewer, and imagined their use as a powerful teaching resource in medical education. For five years, Dr. Gelo has introduced small groups of Drexel University College of Medicine students and residents to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where they view and discuss paintings that depict death and dying. This unique experience has been captured in The Heart of Empathy. The accompanying Facilitator's guide includes program models, resources and suggestions for classroom use.
