Trauma, illness, grief or a major change can all be sources of spiritual distress. What is spiritual health? Spiritual health is a part of overall health. It is the way we find meaning in the world and ourselves. When we are spiritually healthy, we feel courage, strength, hope, and compassion for others. On the other hand, spiritual distress can create feelings of isolation, fear, helplessness and despair. When should I seek spiritual health therapy? Spiritual therapy can help if you or your loved ones are struggling with: - an upcoming surgery - a prognosis or diagnosis - death, dying or loss - questions of meaning or purpose, like \"Why is this happening?\" or \"What do I do now?\" - unresolved guilt or unsettled emotions about the past - feelings of isolation, depression, disconnection or a lack of purpose We can also help you find a community faith group or a specific religious service or ritual. What if I'm not religious? You do not have to belong to a religious group to benefit from this support. If you do belong to a religious faith, we will support you regardless of which faith you belong to. No Osler staff member will ever try to convert you or change your beliefs.
