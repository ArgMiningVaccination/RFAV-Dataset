Editor-in-Chief amatheson@mmhgroup.com 287 www.chromatographyonline.comFROM THE EDITORDifferences in the dwell volume and column volume ratio ( Vd/Vm) between dissimilar liquid chromatography (LC) instruments can the resultant chromatographic selectivity of reversed-phase separations (1-3). This is of major importance for chromatographers who receive or transfer gradient LC methodologies between laboratories where the dwell volumes of differing LC instrumentation may not be similar (assuming that the column dimensions are kept constant). This has been exacerbated with the introduction of ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) instruments (with reduced dwell volumes compared to traditional LC instrumentation) into both research and quality control and operation departments in recent years. While there are numerous seminal academic publications (3-5) relating to this phenomenon, this article discusses and addresses, in nonmathematical terms, the practical importance of the problem of transferring between LC instruments possessing dissimilar dwell volumes. Experimental Experimental work was performed on a Nexera X2 UHPLC (PDA) equipped with a 1 L/10-mm pathlength flow cell and 40-L mixer (Shimadzu UK Ltd). The system was controlled and data collected by means of LabSolutions software (Shimadzu UK Ltd, version 5.86). A 50 \u00d7 2.1 mm, 1.7-m Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 column was used in the study (Agilent Ltd). Modelling was performed using ACD Lab's LC Simulator (version 2016.2.2).

These anomalous effects can be circumvented by either the addition of an isocratic hold (translating from a high to low dwell volume) or by performing a delayed injection (translating from a low to high dwell volume) after the gradient has been started. These selectivity discrepancies can be observed if the analytes are not highly retained at the column inlet during the initial isocratic phase of the gradient corresponding to the dwell volume. The effect of dwell volume on chromatographic selectivity can be successfully modelled using retention prediction software. Hence, the robustness of reversed-phase LC gradient methodologies, with respect to dwell volume, can be conveniently assessed. KEY POINTS Differences in dwell volumes between LC instrumentation can result in major selectivity differences in gradient reversed-phase chromatography. Selectivity discrepancies are the result of analytes starting to elute during the initial isocratic phase of the gradient (corresponding to the dwell volume). Dwell volume differences can be compensated for by the insertion of an isocratic hold (translating from high to low dwell volume instruments) or the use of a delayed injection after the gradient has started (translating from low to high dwell volume instruments). 288 LCGC Europe June 2019EUERBY ET AL.

Dwell volume modifications were simulated by the insertion of isocratic hold times prior to commencing the gradient. Results and Discussion This article examines the importance of differing dwell volumes on the gradient reversed-phase chromatographic selectivity of two mixtures containing hydrophilic and hydrophobic components, respectively. Approaches to circumvent dwell volume differences will also be addressed. In addition, retention modelling software will be evaluated to predict the effect of dwell volume variations on these separations. The importance of retaining the most polar analyte at the column inlet during the initial isocratic phase, equivalent to the dwell volume, will be highlighted in an approach to describe selectivity in gradient chromatography. Finally, in pictorial terms, why changing the dwell volume can have the potential to affect chromatographic selectivity will be discussed. How to Rectify the Problem: The potential of differing dwell volumes to affect chromatographic selectivity in gradient reversed-phase LC is highlighted in Figure 1, where there is a complete elution reversal between analytes 3 and 4 when transferring between a binary high-pressure LC system (V d = 202 L, Vd / Vm = 1.8) and a quaternary low-pressure LC system ( Vd = 990 L, Vd / Vm = 9.0) (1). This can be rectified by performing a delayed injection, that is, by injecting the analytes after the gradient has been started to remove the excess dwell volume on the low-pressure LC and large dwell volume instrumentation (Figure 2). Alternatively, a translation in the opposite direction can be rectified by the introduction of an initial isocratic hold. There are software programs on the internet that can assist the chromatographer in this task (1,6). In addition, most of the major instrument manufacturers now incorporate this type of capability within their data acquisition software.

For small molecules this can be achieved using a simple linear model based on only two gradient input experiments (differing gradient time [ t G] experiments with the same dwell volume), respectively. The predicted chromatogram for the larger dwell volume mirrored the actual run with an increased dwell volume (achieved by insertion of an appropriate isocratic hold time prior to commencing the gradient) and can be seen in Figure 3. It is also possible to do this for larger molecules, such as proteins, but then a modified model may be required (7). How do Dwell Volume Differences Affect Chromatographic Selectivity in Reversed-Phase LC Separations?: Why do dwell volume variations have the potential to promote such drastic changes in chromatographic selectivity? As can be seen in Figure 4, there is a progression in the change in selectivity between caffeine (3), 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (4), and salicylamide (5), and also between acetylsalicylic acid (7), salicylic acid (8), and phenacetin (9) as the dwell volume is steadily increased. Retention modelling software relies on the linear solvent strength model (3,5,8). Hence, the answer must be dependent on the analyte's retention as a function of the proportion organic (%B) in the mobile phase at the start of the gradient\u2014the bigger the dwell volume, the longer the analyte will experience isocratic elution conditions. The earliest eluting analyte's (for example, peak 1, paracetamol) peak width is relatively broad compared to the later eluting peaks, which is because it elutes in the initial isocratic phase corresponding to the dwell volume of the LC system. However, its retention and peak width does not change as the dwell volume is increased, that is, insertion of longer initial isocratic conditions before the gradient \"kicks in\". In comparison, later eluting peaks all experienced increased retention as the dwell volume was increased and most experienced increased peak widths (later peaks were less affected than earlier ones) suggesting that they too start to migrate down the column during the initial isocratic periods (corresponding to the dwell volume). The separation between caffeine (3)/3-hydroxybenzoic acid (4) and acetylsalicylic acid (7)/salicylic acid (8) is extremely sensitive to When only exceptional will do Introducing the most advanced nitrogen gas generator for your laboratory Built upon decades of innovation in gas generation for the lab, Genius XE has been designed to deliver maximum performance and condence.

Caffeine elutes before 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and acetylsalicylic acid before salicylic acid at low dwell volumes ( Vd = 238 L), whereas at high dwell volumes ( Vd = 988 L) 3-hydroxybenzoic acid elutes before caffeine and salicylic acid before acetylsalicylic acid (Vd = 1976 L, result not shown). Construction of a log retention factor versus %B plot for the analytes mirrors these observations (Figure 5) in that the elution order between caffeine/3- hydroxybenzoic acid and acetylsalicylic acid/salicylic acid switch at low and high %B isocratic conditions, respectively. At larger dwell volumes the peaks experience the initial isocratic conditions for a longer time, which means that lowly retained analytes will move further down the column. In comparison, at smaller dwell volumes the gradient \"kicks in\" earlier so that the peaks will experience the higher %B sooner\u2014rationalizing the elution order changes observed on increasing the dwell volume in this gradient example. Defining Selectivity in Gradient Chromatography: Selectivity in gradient chromatography ( *) has been defined in various publications (3,9) where gradient chromatography presents a more complex situation than isocratic chromatography in that changing eluent composition, dwell volume, column dead volume, and gradient shape can all influence the selectivity. A detailed description of how dwell volume affects retention in gradient chromatography can be found in reference 8, however, no comment on its effect on selectivity was made. A recent paper (9) evaluated a variety of ways of measuring * using a range of peptides (molecular weight 2-3 kDa). The most robust and intuitive methodology was defined by equation 1, where t g in equation 2 is the retention time in gradient elution and tm and td are column dead time and dwell time, respectively: (tg2) * = (1) (tg1) tg = tg - tm - td (2) It was concluded, however, that the value of * as described in equation 1 was heavily dependent on the analyte's gradient elution time, despite having a similar degree of separation. In order to obtain a selectivity measure for samples independent of where a pair of analytes eluted in the gradient, an alternative measure tg* was defined (equation 3). tg* provided identical selectivity values, regardless of the analyte's elution time in the gradient. Another advantage of this approach is that it also should compensate for differences in dwell time ( td) and column dead time ( tm): the retention in gradient elution, tg Ref1 is the retention in gradient chromatography of the first eluting compound in the 1 1(a) (b) (c) (d) (e)(f)2 2 0.25 1.25 2.25 3.25 0.75 1.75 2.75 0.50 1.50 2.50 1.00 2.00 3.003 34 45 56 67 78 89 9 Time (min)FIGURE 4: Effect of increasing the dwell volume from 238 to 988 L on a reversed-phase LC separation.

This approach was shown to be valid for compensating between LC instruments with different dwell volumes for the gradient analysis of peptides. This approach works well for solutes approximating to a bind and elute (on/ off) retention mechanism because they are highly retained (trapped) at the column inlet during the beginning of the gradient program. Can This Approach be Applied to Small-Molecular-Weight Analytes?: This same approach, when applied to small polar analytes (logD = -0.34-1.78 at pH 2.7) using the experimental conditions described in Figure 1, failed to compensate for dwell volume differences because nearly all of the peaks to some extent failed to be retained at the column inlet. In order to investigate this more thoroughly, a range of more hydrophobic analytes (see Table 1, logD = 1.24- 4.75 at pH 2.7), which used a wider gradient range ( = 0.9 corresponding to a 90% change in strong solvent) compared to the small polar analytes investigated in Figure 3 ( = 0.22), were evaluated. The results shown in Table 1 highlight the fact that for the t g* approach to work, the first reference peak ( tg Ref1) must possess a large enough retention factor (> 40) at the initial %B composition in order for it to be retained at the column inlet; the approach failed to work for acetanilide and phenol (too polar to be fully retained at the column inlet during the initial isocratic conditions), but worked effectively for analytes that were fully retained (more retentive than methylparaben).

Peptides are normally highly retained at the initial gradient conditions and respond much more strongly than small molecules to an increase in %B (that is, the slope [S] of the log k versus %B plots are typically >50 for large molecules [S 0.25 \u00d7 (MW)0.5 (3)] compared to S values of 4-5 for small molecules <1 kDa). Once again, retention modelling was demonstrated to be able to predict the effect of increased dwell volumes on the chromatographic selectivity of the separation of these more hydrophobic analytes (Figure 6). For the more hydrophobic species, their chromatographic selectivity did not change as the dwell volume was increased because they are highly retained at the column inlet irrespective of the length of the initial isocratic conditions. In comparison, the two early eluting, more polar analytes, that is, phenol and acetanilide logD at pH 2.7 = 1.63 and 1.24, respectively, coeluted at low dwell volumes ( Vd = 238 L), while increasing the dwell volume (Vd = 988 L) afforded their separation.TABLE 1: Gradient selectivity descriptor ( tg*) calculated using differing references (Ref1) in equation 4. Ref1 has to be highly retained during the initial gradient conditions corresponding to the dwell volume for the approach to work correctly.

Despite the small disparities in dwell volumes between UHPLC ( 130-700 L depending on the type of pump and mixer design or volume) and standard LC instruments ( 1000 L), major selectivity differences can still be observed, including elution reversal, between LC systems possessing dissimilar dwell volumes. This has potential repercussions for practising chromatographers. This dwell volume theory should equally apply to other types of gradient LC including ion-exchange chromatography (IEC), hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). However, simple measures can be successfully applied to compensate for dwell volume variations. For example, a correctly translated and scaled methodology eliminates selectivity differences in gradient chromatography because of discrepancies in dwell volume (V d/Vm) by the introduction of a delayed injection ( Vd/Vm larger in new method) or an initial isocratic hold ( Vd/Vm smaller in the new method). Dwell volumes can be readily determined as described in references 7 and 10. A description of the principles and potential pitfalls related to translations between differing LC formats can be found in a previous LCGC article (1). It is important that standard operating procedures (SOPs) for gradient chromatographic methods specify the dwell volume range that the method is valid for to facilitate the successful translation to LC systems with dissimilar dwell volumes. The robustness of gradient methodologies, with respect to dwell volume, can be conveniently assessed using retention modelling software. Ideally, in gradient chromatography, the analytes must be highly retained at the column inlet under the initial gradient conditions otherwise they may start to migrate down the column in the dwell volume phase of the separation. If the analytes start to migrate, then different dwell volumes may lead to selectivity changes. However, if the analytes do not migrate during initial isocratic conditions of the analysis (that is, corresponding to the dwell volume) then the retention of all analytes will be affected to the same extent.

In two recent instalments of \"LC Troubleshooting\", I discussed the roles of mixers in liquid chromatography (LC) systems in a general sense (1,2). Mixers are often used in pumping systems to smooth out short-term irregularities in mobile phase composition. They are used less frequently between the sample injection point and the LC column, but doing so can be remarkably useful, helping to alleviate some problems caused by mismatch between the properties of the sample diluent and the mobile phase the sample is injected into. This month, I have asked AbbVie scientists Zach Breitbach, Corianne Randstrom, Jean Chang, Michael Lesslie, and Gregory Webster to join me in discussing some of their results that illustrate the utility of mixers in practice. By way of several examples, we first show the poor peak shapes that can result from sample and mobile phase mismatch, and then show how inline mixers can be used to resolve this problem and produce much better analytical results. Dwight Stoll Review from Last Time: Effect of Diluent and Eluent Mismatch on Peak Shape In January of this year, we wrote about how diluent and eluent mismatch can negatively affect separations, especially when the injection volume is a significant fraction (more than about 1%) of the column dead volume (3). This can be observed for all types of separations, but in January we focused this effect for hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) separations because it seems this is not widely appreciated in the separations community. A subset of these results is shown in Figure 1, where we compare the chromatograms obtained for a simple two-component mixture of cytidine and guanosine under HILIC conditions. In this case, the injection volume of 20 L is about 20% of the column volume, and terrible chromatography is observed if the sample diluent is 100% water (Figure 1[a]). The peaks are not just split; a significant fraction of the mass of both compounds breaks through and elutes at the dead time of the column. Further, some drug product (DP) extractions require a particular pH or stronger diluents, and some targeted impurities may not be amenable to dilution with weak solvent following extraction because this makes it difficult to reach the detection limits required for trace analysis. In the example shown in Figure 1, we can easily resolve the problem by simply changing the diluent to 95:5 acetonitrile-water. This yields the chromatogram shown in Figure 1(b), where the peaks are entirely respectable and well separated, with no sample breakthrough observed. In this example, we can resolve the diluent and eluent mismatch problem by simply changing the diluent to more closely resemble the eluent. In some applications, however, this is not a viable solution because of the low solubility of some sample components in diluents that resemble the eluent (in the case of gradient elution, the initial eluent used in the gradient). In these cases, attempting to dilute the sample with eluent prior to injection can result in precipitation of sample components, which in turn can lead to poor analyte recovery and plugging of LC components and columns. It Diluent and eluent mismatch can negatively affect separations, especially when the injection volume is a signi cant fraction of the column dead volume. 298 LCGC Europe June 2019LC TROUBLESHOOTINGis in these situations that adding an inline mixer between the sample injection point and the column can be a relatively simple and effective solution to the diluent and eluent mismatch problem. In the following examples, we show the benefit of this approach in the context of real applications. Adding an Inline Mixer As discussed last year in \"LC Troubleshooting\" (1,2), mixers are commonly used in LC pumping systems to smooth out short-term variations in eluent composition that result from nonideal pump behaviour. The position of mixers used for this purpose relative to the high-pressure pump and sample injector is shown in Figure 2. When we refer to an inline mixer in this article, we are referring to the placement of a mixer between the sample injector and the LC column, shown in Figure 2 as \"Mixer-2\". Although using an inline mixer is not common practice, adding an inline mixer to an LC setup is straightforward. Some commercially available mixers are based on sophisticated fluidic designs that have been optimized for mixing efficiency. Some mixing can also be achieved by simply adding a piece of larger than normal tubing between the injector and the column (for example, 0.010-0.020-in. internal diameter [i.d.] tubing). Of course, these different approaches to mixing have advantages and disadvantages, and these should be considered carefully during method development. Example #1: Fixing Peak Shape for a Hydrophilic API Impurity: It is common to encounter impurities related to an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that are much more hydrophilic (water soluble) than the API itself. This type of situation presents a challenge during method development because API or drug product samples assayed for impurities contain compounds with a wide range of water solubilities or pK a values, and require rather Mixers are commonly used in LC pumping systems to smooth out short-term variations in eluent composition that result from nonideal pump behaviour.

Figure 3 shows a series of chromatograms focused on the peak shape of a hydrophilic impurity that elutes early in a reversed-phase gradient elution method. Figure 3(a) shows the peak observed with a conventional LC setup, with the injector connected directly to the column with no inline mixer installed. The peak shape in this case does not appear to be that bad at first glance, with just a slight \"foot\" on the front of the peak. However, the chromatograms obtained when adding mixers of different volumes between the injector and column (Figures 3[b]-3[d]) show that the result with no mixer is far worse than was immediately evident. Adding the 25, 50, and 100 L mixers adds significantly to the area on the front side of the peak. This reveals the fact that when no mixer is used, the peak splits so severely that a significant fraction of the analyte mass elutes at the dead time.

In other words, the area under the peak eluting at the dead time is not considered in this calculation. This plot is shown in Figure 4. Here we see that, when the injection volume is small, the recovery is high because under these conditions the peak does not split, and all of the mass is accounted for by the peak at 3.3 min. However, as the injection volume is increased, larger mixers are required to prevent peak splitting and maintain ~100% recovery. Although the peak in the case of the 100 L mixer is broader than we would like, this is a consequence of the relatively large injection volume and the hydrophilic nature of the impurity. Here, it is more important to obtain good recovery of the analyte than it is to have a narrow peak because this impurity is well separated from the rest of the mixture. Finally, Figure 5 shows that the addition of the inline mixer does not have significant negative impacts on the characteristics (peak width and shape) of the peaks eluting later in the chromatogram. Example #2: Fixing Peak Shape for Laurylglycol in Tetrahydrofuran Diluent: The challenge illustrated by the previous example arises from the low retention of a very hydrophilic compound under reversed-phase conditions. However, we can encounter similar problems, even for relatively hydrophobic compounds, if the mismatch between the properties of the sample diluent and eluent is large enough.

Under the conditions of the experiment, the lauryl glycol is eluted from the reversed-phase column in 100% acetonitrile. And yet, in spite of the high reversed-phase retention of this compound, we still observe a small shoulder on the front of the peak in the case where no mixer is used. This results from the same type of effect illustrated in Figure 1 (for HILIC conditions) and Figures 3-5 because the tetrahydrofuran sample diluent is a very strong solvent for reversed-phase columns. The good news here is that the problem is easily resolved in this case through the addition of a low-volume mixer. Because the lauryl glycol is pretty \"sticky\" under reversed-phase conditions, it only takes a modest modulation of the tetrahydrofuran level as the sample plug travels through the column to produce a big effect on retention of the analyte, and, in turn, the improvement of peak shape by eliminating the shoulder on the front of the peak. Summary In this instalment of \"LC Troubleshooting\", we have shown, by way of examples from real small molecule pharmaceutical analysis, how implementation of an inline mixer in an LC system between the sample injection point and the analytical column can be useful for fixing poor peak shapes that result from mismatch between sample diluent and mobile phase. In serious cases of this mismatch, peak distortion can be so bad that some of the analyte elutes at the column dead time, leading to apparently low mass recoveries. In these cases, adding the inline mixer may not only improve peak shape, but also mass recovery. Finally, we have shown that the volume of the mixer itself affects the extent to which this approach mitigates the diluent and mobile phase mismatch problem, and thus users are advised to determine by experiment which mixer volume will be most appropriate for their application.

Developing mAbs and next-generation antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) is highly demanding in many ways. From an analytical perspective, handling mAbs and ADCs presents many new challenges. This article describes how size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) can be applied to the detailed characterization of and ADCs. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) emerged important therapeutics for the treatment of life-threatening diseases (1,2,3). Together with a huge therapeutic potential, these products come with an enormous structural complexity. In contrast to small molecule drugs, mAbs are large (150 kDa) and heterogeneous. Many structural variants may co-exist all contributing to the safety and efficacy of the product. As a result, the detailed characterization of these products requires an arsenal of analytical tools providing complementary information (1,2). Chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS) are indispensable in that respect and characteristics such as amino acid sequence, molecular weight and structural integrity, N- and O-glycosylation, N- and C-terminal processing, oxidation, clipping, sequence variants, as well as higher order structural information, can readily be extracted out of the data generated (1,2). Historically, reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) has been the chromatographic mode of choice to be hyphenated to MS, and reversed-phase LC-MS has been widely applied for the analysis of intact mAbs and ADCs as well as fragments thereof (1,2). In recent years, reversed-phase LC-MS has been challenged by other combinations and reports can be found describing the hyphenation of hydrophilic interaction chromatography chromatography (SEC) (14-20), and even affinity chromatography (21) to MS for the characterization of mAbs and ADCs. This article describes the use of SEC in combination with high-resolution (HR)MS to the detailed characterization of mAbs and ADCs. These measurements provide insight in mAb identity and structural integrity, post-translational modifications (for example, glycosylation) next to drug distribution Many structural variants of mAbs may co-exist all contributing to the safety and ef cacy of the product. 304 LCGC Europe June 2019BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PERSPECTIVESPERFORMANCE EQUAL TO OR BETTER THAN GC DETECTORS WITH CONVENTIONAL RADIOACTIVE SOURCES. Universal detector Large linear range Mass sensitive SEC conditions allowing separation and ionization in both denatured and native state are described. Native measurements are particularly important to study molecules maintained by noncovalent interactions. The value of column inertness for specific applications will be touched upon. Experimental Materials: Acetonitrile and water were obtained from Biosolve. Formic acid (TFA), Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell culture supernatant was kindly provided by a local biotechnology company. Sample Preparation: For intact mAb measurements, the mAb was diluted to 2 mg/mL for denaturing SEC-MS and 5 mg/mL for native SEC-MS using 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5. To generate the F(ab)'2 and Fc/2 fragments, the mAb or ADC was diluted to 0.5 mg/mL for denaturing SEC-MS and 5 mg/mL for native SEC-MS using 50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.6. Subsequently, IdeZ was added in an enzyme-protein ratio of 1:1 (U/g) and digestion was performed at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min. To generate the Fab or Fc fragment, the mAb was diluted to 2 mg/mL using 50 mM sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM cysteine, pH 7. After activation, the papain was added in an enzyme-protein ratio of 1:60 (g/ g) and digestion was performed at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. To generate the heavy (Hc) and light chain (Lc), the sample was diluted to 0.2 mg/mL using 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 after which DTT was added to a final concentration of 10 mM. Reduction was performed at 60 \u00b0C for 1 h. Prior to injection, all samples were centrifuged at 2000 g for 1 min. Methods: SEC-MS measurements were performed on a 1290 Infinity Technologies) thermostat for autosampler (G1330B), column compartment (G1316C), DAD detector (G4212A). The above LC configuration was hyphenated to FIGURE 1: SEC-UV chromatograms (280 nm) of trastuzumab obtained using different mobile phase compositions + pictures of the MS source. Column: BioSEC-3.

The flow rate was set at 1 mL/min, column temperature was maintained at 24 \u00b0C, and injection volume varied between 5 and 20 L. UV data were acquired at 214 nm and 280 nm. The operational parameters for the QTOF source were drying gas temperature: 350 \u00b0C, drying gas 10 min, 1000 V, capillary voltage: 3500 V, and fragmentor voltage at either 200 V (papain, reduced, IdeZ) or 350 V (intact mAb). QTOF data were collected in profile mode at a rate of 1 spectrum per second. The system was operated in high resolution mode (4 GHz) for denaturing SEC-MS or extended mass range mode (2 GHz) for native SEC-MS. The diverter valve on the MS system was bypassed and the column outlet was directly connected to the ESI needle with PEEK tubing (0.12 mm). Results and Discussion SEC has the lowest efficiency or resolution of all chromatographic modes, but it is extremely powerful to determine aggregation and fragmentation. SEC typically makes use of a buffer containing nonvolatile salts (for example, phosphate buffer at neutral pH), which is delivered isocratically to a column packed with particles with fixed pore sizes that govern the separation by hydrodynamic radius (22,23). Indeed, molecules travel through the column at a speed depending on particle pore accessibility.

As such, SEC is the only chromatographic mode that does not rely on interactions with the stationary phase; if these do exist, they are considered as unwanted. The typical mobile phase conditions used in SEC are not compatible with MS. Indeed, in many applications, peaks are collected (on- or off-line) and desalted prior to mass spectrometric measurement (24,25,26). Figure 1 compares the separations of the humanized mAb trastuzumab on a SEC column using a nonvolatile buffer and MS-compatible mobile phases that make use of volatile constituents. When using a phosphate buffer, sharp peaks are obtained and aggregates and fragments can be detected at levels as low as 0.1%. Spraying a phosphate buffer in the MS system, however, gives rise to a dirty source and lack of MS signal. When using a mobile phase containing 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% FA, and 0.1% TFA or 100 mM NH 4-acetate, proteins can be nicely sprayed in the MS system generating high-quality MS data. The former mobile phase separates and sprays proteins in a denatured state, the latter in a native state, thereby maintaining noncovalent interactions.

UV and MS chromatograms are very similar in terms of peak widths. The path from the UV detector to the MS system does not contribute substantially to peak dispersion in case the MS diverter valve is bypassed. Deconvoluted MS data associated with the annotated peaks are shown in Figure 4. Fab, Fc, and smaller fragments are identified and glycosylation revealed. The measured molecular weight (MW) values are well below 0.005% of the theoretical MW values. As can be deduced from the MS data of peaks c, d, and e in Figure 4, separation is not purely driven by size. Figure 5 shows the SEC-UV-MS data of intact Herceptin. Several peaks are annotated and the corresponding deconvoluted spectra are shown in Figure 6. The intact mAb with a MW around 150 kDa is successfully measured and the glycosylation pattern is detailed. Fragments of the mAb, being half antibody, light chain dimer, cysteinylated (Cys), and glutathionylated (GSH) light chain, are also highlighted. The SEC-UV-MS data of the supernatant of a trastuzumab-producing CHO clone and the corresponding Protein A purified sample (intact and DTT reduced) are shown in Figure 7. Protein A binds the Fc region and can be used to selectively enrich mAbs out of cell culture supernatants. The corresponding MS data allow the annotation of the different peaks. Figure 8 presents the deconvoluted MS spectra associated with the Lc and Hc of the reduced Protein A purified sample. glycosylation, Hc C-terminal lysine truncation, and Lc glycation is obtained. This once more illustrates the level of detail in mAb characteristics that can be obtained with the described SEC-MS method.

Insight into glycosylation, DAR, and drug distribution is provided. When performing measurements in native conditions, the Fc fragment is maintained by noncovalent interactions as is nicely reflected in the deconvoluted spectra of peaks c and f. Indeed, since the Fc is maintained by noncovalent interactions, a MW of 50 kDa (Fc) is observed opposed to a MW of 25 kDa (Fc/2) in cases where organic solvent and acids are used (peaks b and e). As observed in Figure 9, secondary interactions exist when analyzing the ADC and these are particularly pronounced when using ammonium acetate as mobile phase. The cytotoxic drugs conjugated to trastuzumab have a hydrophobic nature and are prone to interact with the surface of the stationary phase, thereby overruling the SEC principle. This effect is somewhat limited in denaturing conditions since the acetonitrile used disrupts hydrophobic interactions between ADC and stationary phase. In recent years, several novel SEC columns have been introduced that limit nonspecific interactions (27). The analysis of IdeZ-digested ado-trastuzumab emtansine on such a next-generation inert column using 100 mM NH 4-acetate is shown in Figure 11. Deconvoluted spectra are shown in Figure 12. By coating the silica particles with a hydrophilic polymer, nonspecific binding is eliminated, allowing all DAR species to appear in one single SEC peak (compare the lower chromatograms in Figure 9 obtained on a first-generation SEC column with the chromatograms in Figure 11 obtained on next-generation inert SEC column). Conclusion SEC-UV-MS represents a powerful addition to the analytical toolbox and opens new possibilities towards the detailed characterization of mAbs and ADCs.

Furthermore, conditions can be found that allow to separate and spray proteins in denatured or in native state, thereby maintaining noncovalent interactions.

Compiled by Alasdair Matheson, Editor-in-Chief, LCGC Europe Towards Merging Targeted and Untargeted Analysis of the Lipidome, Metabolome, and Exposome Tomas Cajka, Department of Metabolomics and Department of Translational Metabolism, Institute of Physiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic Many scientists draw a strict line between targeted and untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics analysis. Untargeted methods focus on the analysis of all the detectable metabolites in a sample, including chemical unknowns, and results are typically reported in arbitrary units (1). Conversely, targeted analysis is the measurement of defined groups of metabolites that are quantified using certified standards (2). However, during untargeted analysis of biological samples, many known metabolites are expected to be detected. Some of them, such as trimethylamine N-oxide (3), trimethyllysine (4), diacetylspermine (5), branched-chain amino acids (6), acylcarnitines (7), or various lipid species (8), have been reported as biomarkers of various diseases. Merging untargeted analysis with a targeted approach promises to provide not only the data for hypothesis-generating studies, but also quantitative data for hypothesis-driven validation. Why is this important? First, reporting absolute concentrations of particular metabolites is crucial to enable direct comparisons of the results between different laboratories and studies. Second, absolute metabolite quantities immediately distinguish major from minor species, allowing biological interpretations of the results in the context of other analytes (9,10). The true breadth and scope of polar metabolites (metabolome), complex lipids (lipidome), and various exogenous compounds, such as drugs or food components (exposome), cannot be captured by a single extraction method or instrumental platform. Human biospecimens, such as blood, can contain metabolites and exposome compounds covering over 40 orders of magnitude on the octanol- water partition coefficient scale and ranging from femtomole to millimole concentrations (11,12). Historically, metabolomics and lipidomics sample preparation protocols were used separately. Recent research has shown that a single extraction method can be used to isolate both polar metabolites and complex lipids, followed by fractionation and analysis of each fraction under different separation conditions. This is important because some samples are available in very low quantities permitting a single shot. Also, use of separate extraction method for each platform would be laborious and time-consuming (for example, tissue samples). Currently, the use of a liquid-liquid extraction approach using methanol-methyl tert-butyl ether-water (13) or methanol-chloroform-water (14) provides two phases: one containing mostly nonpolar metabolites (complex lipids) and the other mostly consisting of polar metabolites (11). By using appropriate resuspension solvent or solvent mixture, and an appropriate separation and mass spectrometry (MS) configuration, a broad coverage of low-molecular-weight compounds can be obtained by using a single extraction for a given matrix (15). Sample preparation is one side of the coin. The other one represents sample separation. Coupling separation techniques and MS provides advantages such as separation and detection of isobars and isomers, reduced ion-suppression effects, and the possibility to separate compounds according to their physicochemical properties (11). The main task though is to achieve high metabolite coverage using as few platforms as possible while maintaining the requisite precision and accuracy for the metabolite classes detected by the chosen platforms. Liquid chromatography (LC)MS has become the most applied chromatographyMS tool for the analysis of both polar and nonpolar metabolites (~66% applications) followed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) used for analysis of volatile metabolites and for after derivatization (~30% applications) and Luckily, various 314 LCGC Europe June 2019HPLC 2019Top : Separation of 6 peptides on an ACE Excel 5 C18 HPLC column installed on an HPLC instrument.

In metabolomics, reversed-phase LC followed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) are the most frequently used LC-based separation methods In lipidomics, normal-phase LC and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) are also used (18). On top of that, processing of metabolomics and lipidomics data is still challenging in spite of the recent developments in this area. The past processing pipelines were mainly developed for filtering, feature detection, and peak alignment, and the final reports comprise extracted mass-to-charge (m/z) values, their retention times, and corresponding intensity for all detected peaks (19,20). The current trend is to link these outcomes with automated compound annotation using tandem mass spectral library search (21) if MS/MS spectra were collected either through traditional data-dependent or novel data-independent analysis (DDA, DIA) (22-24). Such an approach allows hundreds of polar metabolites, complex lipids, or exposome compounds to be reported in addition to thousands of unknowns. When comparing different software programs, researchers have focused too much on hunting and reporting as many peaks (features) as possible to ultimately present \"the best software\". It is frequently ignored that many features may originate from extraction blank or as mobile-phase impurities, and that the same metabolite can occur as in-source fragments, isotopes, or multiple adducts. Also, without properly tuned and validated parameters it is difficult to draw a conclusion about the comparison of data processing software programs. In my keynote lecture at HPLC 2019, I will address these challenges and introduce an LCMS workflow (LIpids, Metabolites and eXposome compounds [LIMeX]) of complex lipids, polar metabolites, and exposome compounds that combines LC-MS targeted and untargeted analysis. Our aim was to look at each step of the metabolomics and lipidomics workflow and streamline where possible to, ultimately, develop a simple, fast, and robust protocol that can be applied for diverse sample types.

Taking the HPLC conference series as the benchmark, the 2016 edition in San Francisco, USA, featured the first debate on the topic within the open floor discussion: Columns of the Future....and Beyond . In this same edition, both the poster prize and the Csaba Horv\u00e1th Award were awarded to contributions on 3D-printed columns (4). This trend continued to grow at HPLC 2017 in Prague, Czech Republic, with Brett Paull's original contribution entitled, Another 12 Months Closer to 3D Printed HPLC Columns , where commercial 3D-printed columns were predicted to hit the market by 2020. At HPLC 2018 in Washington, USA, I was invited to deliver a tutorial on 3D Printing in the Separation Sciences where I covered aspects related to other areas of separation science other than just liquid chromatography (LC). This year, the HPLC 2019 edition in Milan features, for the first time, a pre-conference short course on the same topic, and a new session on 3D Printing and Micro and Nanofluidics has been established to accommodate the larger number of contributions in the area. Despite the tremendous progress, a number of challenges need to be carefully addressed for this technology to break into the future. The most pressing one is the \"speed/ resolution/build size\" conundrum. It is impossible to achieve all three requirements at the same time. For example, two photon\u2014photo polymerization can 3D print models with nanoscale resolution, but can only fabricate small micrometre-sized objects in reasonable times\u2014an estimate printing time for a traditional 100-L column is approximately 5 months! On the other hand, another 3D-printing technique called digital light processing can produce a full 5-mL column in a couple of hours, but its resolution can produce columns with internal features with a scale on the hundreds of micrometres (5). New techniques addressing this problem are emerging, for example, the continuous liquid interface production (CLIP) (6) and the very recent computed axial lithography (CAL) (7). Interestingly, this latter technique is able to generate inch-sized objects in a matter of a few minutes with excellent finish, and is also capable of 3D printing around pre-existing objects such as, for example, an empty chromatographic column to create the internal bed morphology! Another aspect to be addressed is the compatibility between materials used in chromatographic operations and additive manufacturing methods. So far, there is a disconnect between the two, with 3D printing mostly focusing on mechanical properties and durability of the printed parts, including their chemical inertness, while LC requires a good level of chemical flexibility to incorporate the chemical functionalities and chromatographic ligands to enable separations. 100 YEARS OF ADVANCING SCIENCE New columns include: \u0017IMMOBILISED CHIRAL COLUMNS WWW.CHIRALTECH.COM-2,1\u000386\u0003$7\u0003+3/&\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0014 \u0003 %227+\u0003\u0006\u0014\u0016I foresee research in the area of 3D printing in the separation sciences will grow exponentially, and will become a concrete reality in the near future. 317 www.chromatographyonline.comHPLC 2019Additionally, most of the 3D-printing materials commercially available have proprietary composition, which further hampers their use in the highly regulated environments of the food, drug, and biopharmaceutical industries where the chemical composition of the stationary phase needs to be precisely characterized. This limitation has sparked the development of new materials for chromatography compatible with existing 3D printers (5), but an equally valid approach is the development ex-novo of new 3D-printing methods that can process traditional chromatographic materials at the appropriate level of resolution and speed. I foresee research in the area of 3D printing in the separation sciences will grow exponentially, and will become a concrete reality in the near future. Considering this is a relatively new field, with much to do and still little competition: Is it time for you to join the 3D-printing revolution in chromatography? References 1) C. Fee, S.

Multidimensional Liquid Chromatography Approaches for Characterization of Protein Biopharmaceuticals Davy Guillarme, University of Geneva, University of Lausanne, Geneva, Switzerland At the previous HPLC 2018 symposium, there was a strong focus on the analytical characterization of protein biopharmaceuticals, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). In particular, there was an opening plenary lecture from Stacey Ma (Genentech, San Francisco, California, USA) about the most recent analytical technologies used in the biopharmaceutical industry. Additionally, there were also several dedicated lectures and posters sessions on the analysis of mAbs, ADCs, and other formats of protein-based drugs. Since the development of recombinant insulin in 1982, the number of protein-based drugs has dramatically increased, and protein biopharmaceuticals have emerged as important therapeutic options for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and even migraines. Based on this broad range of applications, numerous pharmaceutical companies are increasing their efforts aimed at the research and product development of biologics. Given their obvious benefits in terms of safety and efficacy, mAbs are today the most successful biopharmaceutical products and have totally reshaped the pharmaceutical market (1). As well as mAbs, there is also strong interest in mAb-related products, such as new ADC formats, fusion proteins, PEGylated proteins, bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), antibody fragments (nanobodies and Fab), and polyclonal antibodies (pAb). Last, but not least, some of the first-generation mAbs and fusion proteins will come off patent soon, and there is consequently a significant increase of biosimilars activity requiring powerful analytical methods for comparability assessment of originators and biosimilars. It is indeed important to keep in mind that these products are highly complex in terms of structure, and the characterization of therapeutic mAbs and ADCs is a tremendous challenge to state-of-the-art analytical technologies. Indeed, subtle changes in these large (greater than 150 kDa) molecules can have profound effects on efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, and toxicity. It is therefore important to have the ability to rapidly and accurately assess changes in the distribution of different isoforms, for example, glycosylation, oxidation, deamidation, lysine Europe June 2019HPLC 2019www.AntecScientific.com Decade Elite Electrochemical detector for any (U)HPLC system Today, the most widely used analytical approaches for therapeutic protein characterization are liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS), probably as a result of the remarkable developments of these strategies in the past few years, which have enabled a new level of performance. Lectures and posters at HPLC 2019 will demonstrate the usefulness of modern LC and MS approaches to demonstrate the product quality and increase the safety of biopharmaceutical products. As well as the conventional LC modes, such as size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), ion exchange chromatography (IEC), hydrophobic interaction reversed-phase LC, and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), it is also possible to combine the most promising chromatographic strategies in a comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC \u00d7LC) setup. This allows for a more detailed characterization of some highly complex and heterogeneous new biological entities, thanks to a significantly better peak capacity. In addition, LC \u00d7LC also offers the opportunity to combine nondenaturing chromatographic modes requiring significant amount of nonvolatile salts (IEC and SEC) to MS, using a desalting step in the second dimension. Even though LC \u00d7LC is becoming more and more popular for the analysis of small molecules, it has only very recently been used for biopharmaceutical characterization (3,4). During my presentation at the next HPLC 2019 symposium, I will try to highlight the new trends in LC \u00d7LC applied for biopharmaceutical characterization, including the hyphenation with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS).

Making Nontargeted Liquid Chromatography-High- Resolution Mass Spectrometry Analysis Quantitative Anneli Kruve, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden Targeted screening with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has solidified its status in the field of analytical chemistry for research, industry, and legislative purposes. At the same time, the applicability of suspect and nontargeted screening is growing fast. Nontargeted analysis allows the detection of hundreds or thousands of features simultaneously; while classical targeted methods only allow the detection of previously selected compounds. The most significant obstacles for nontargeted liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) screening at the moment are the scarcely defined scope of the method and, more importantly, the inability to provide quantitative information. This is well illustrated by the data. Currently, the Human Metabolome Database contains 114,100 compounds and only 3383 (<3%) of these have been both detected and quantified (1). As a result of the intensive developments in the field of compound identification tools, the proportion of compounds that can be identified with nontargeted methods is constantly increasing. However, the inability to quantify these compounds is a problem not only in metabolomics, but also in pharmaceutical analysis, environmental analysis, and even in monitoring illegal substances. The inability to provide quantitative data originates from the vastly different ionization efficiencies of different compounds in an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and, therefore, standard substances need to be used for quantification. The overall scale of ionization efficiencies covers six orders of magnitude in both ESI positive and negative mode (2). For example, even relatively similar compounds, such as the positional isomers 2- and 4-nitrophenol, yield a 40 times different response at equal concentrations (3). Additionally, different LC conditions affect ionization efficiencies (4). 320 LCGC Europe June 2019HPLC 2019The answer to obtaining quantitative information lies in the prediction of ionization efficiencies of the identified compounds. Lately, we have measured more than 3000 ionization efficiency values in ESI positive mode and more than 1000 values in ESI negative mode. These measurements have been conducted in vastly different solvents (60 combinations); eluents with both methanol and acetonitrile with 0 to 100% content, pH range from 2.0 to 10.7 with all common LC-MS buffers, and seven different mass spectrometric instruments have been used. For the prediction, both the structure of the compound as well as the eluent characteristics are very important. Various descriptors of compounds, as well as empirical parameters of eluent, together with machine-learning algorithm help to predict the ionization efficiency. Currently, the average prediction error of ionization efficiency is 2-times, which means that actual ionization efficiency is in the range of 0.5 \u00d7 predicted ionization efficiency to 2 \u00d7 predicted ionization efficiency. The accurate result obtained for ionization efficiency predictions has allowed the estimation of the concentration of compounds detected with LC-MS solely based on the measured peak areas and predicted ionization efficiency. This approach has been tested on the screening for food contaminants in cereal samples (positive mode) and metabolites in green tea samples (negative mode) with nontargeted LC-MS methods. Both analyses were performed in the gradient elution mode. In the cereal samples, the average prediction error was below 5-times. This means that if the pesticide concentration is estimated to be 1 ppm then it would actually be between 0.2 ppm and 5 ppm. For the metabolites the average prediction error was less than 2-times. For both samples the concentrations of the detected compounds ranged more than five orders of magnitude (10 -8 to 10-4 M). These prediction errors take into account both the accuracy of predicting ionization efficiencies as well as ionization suppression. It is important to note that quantification is not limited to future analysis, but can also be applied to the results of the nontargeted analysis CHROMacademy is the wor ld's largest eLearning website for analytica l scientists , containing 1000 's of interacti ve learning topics.

The metabolite samples were first analyzed in 2017 in one laboratory, where only some of the compounds could be quantified\u2014 because of the lack of standard substances, several important compounds could not be quantified at the time of analysis. Later, the ionization efficiencies were predicted to the detected metabolites and the concentrations could be assigned to all of the detected compounds. Therefore, standard substance-free quantitation can also be applied retrospectively. The analysis can be performed for all kinds of LC-ESI-MS data. The only prerequisite is that some compounds for which the concentrations are available have been analyzed using the same conditions (eluent and instrument) as the compounds of interest. These compounds, used for transforming the ionization efficiency values to instrument-specific response factors, can be internal standards, quality control samples, or other analytes that have been quantified from the sample with the aid of standard substances. In summary, predicting ionization efficiencies allows broader quantitative coverage of samples analyzed with LC-MS. The high accuracy in the predicted concentrations allows insight to be gained into chemical and biological processes, to estimate more accurately the condition of the environment, and to protect users from possible contaminants in food products. In addition, the quantitative analysis can be made retrospectively if some of the compounds in the samples have been confirmed and quantified with standard substances. References 1) D.S.

Capillary Electrophoresis- Mass Spectrometry for Metabolomics: Extracting Chemical Information from Less Rawi Ramautar, Biomedical Microscale Analytics, Division of Systems Biomedicine and Pharmacology, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University, The Netherlands Metabolomics has become an important tool for addressing biological and clinical questions (1). The analytical techniques commonly used for metabolomics studies often require relatively large amounts of biological material, notably for sample preparation and injection. As many studies have not been focused on limited amounts of sample material, relatively little effort has been paid to downscale the analytical workflow for metabolomics. However, more and more biological questions are dealing with small sample amounts. For example, microfluidic three-dimensional (3D)-cell culture models, which can mimic physiological tissues by arranging different cell types in a 3D environment within a proper micro-environment, are increasingly being used to address biological questions. These microfluidic cell culture systems inherently deal with relatively low numbers of cells, for example, those in the range of hundreds to thousands of cells. Another example concerns the unravelling of the behaviour of a single cell within a population of cells, and, as such, obtaining a better understanding on the role of cell heterogeneity in tumour biology. To address these questions with a metabolomics approach, the development of new microscale analytical techniques and workflows is needed. Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) is an attractive microscale analytical technique for addressing biological questions inherently dealing with low amounts of material. In CE, nanolitre injection volumes are often employed from just a few microlitres of sample. As such, CE-MS is well-adapted for the profiling of especially polar and charged metabolites in tiny sample amounts, as demonstrated for mouse cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (2,3). 322 LCGC Europe -Fusion(P): pH 1-10; 5 m columns for \"Omics\" studies and other applicationsThree complementary selectivities for separation of polar compounds For Email: info@hilicon.com | Website: www.hilicon.com \u00a9 2019 HILICON AB.

Using only a 1:1 dilution of CSF with water, and therefore fully retaining sample integrity, more than 300 compounds could be observed. As only 45 nL of the sample were consumed from a vial containing only 2 L of a 1:1 diluted CSF, the proposed CE-MS approach allows multiple analyses on a single highly valuable mouse CSF sample, enabling repeatability studies and the analysis of the same sample at different separation conditions to further enhance metabolic coverage. Performing multiple analyses on a single scarcely available biological sample is not possible with conventional analytical techniques used in metabolomics. Alongside the low sample and solvent requirement of CE, the separation mechanism of CE, in which compounds are separated on the basis of their charge-to-size ratio, is fundamentally different from chromatographic-based separation techniques, thereby providing a complementary view on the composition of endogenous metabolites present in a given biological sample. In comparison to chromatographic-based methods, the separation efficiency of CE is very high because there is no mass transfer between phases, and under well-designed experimental conditions only longitudinal diffusion contributes to band broadening. An overview of the analytical features of CE-MS for metabolomics studies, especially for those dealing with limited sample amounts, will be given during the short course, Advanced CE-MS approaches for metabolomics, on Sunday 16 June at HPLC 2019 in Milan, Italy.Until now, various research groups have developed CE-MS approaches for metabolic profiling of limited sample amounts (4,5), and also for single-cell analysis (6-9). Concerning the latter, the metabolomics studies were often focused on the analysis of a relatively large single non-mammalian cell with a diameter in the range of 100-1000 m and a cellular sample content ranging from 100 nL to 500 nL. To profile metabolites in a single mammalian cell is clearly an enormous analytical challenge; for example, the content of a single HepG2 cell is only around 3 pL and a diameter of ~12 m. In my group, low-flow CE-MS approaches using a sheathless porous tip interface are examined for metabolic profiling of low numbers of mammalian cells using HepG2 cells as a model system (10). The aim is to be able to profile a wide range of endogenous metabolites in just a few cells and ultimately a single cell; the latter will really enable the effect of cell heterogeneity to be studied\u2014a subject that really matters in key fundamental biological questions. In my keynote lecture at HPLC 2019, I will address the current state-of-the-art of our CE-MS platform for metabolic profiling of low numbers of mammalian cells by presenting results obtained for HepG2 cells. Metabolomics studies dealing with small amounts of biological sample have to critically consider preanalytical steps because adsorption effects, notably with sample volumes far below 1 L, may result in significant analyte losses. Moreover, another challenge is how to effectively get the compounds or the fraction of interest from ultra-small sample amounts into the CE-MS system. Various strategies that have been explored in our laboratory and by others will also be outlined during HPLC 2019. References 1) R. Ramautar, R. Berger, J. van der Greef, and T. Hankemeier, Curr.

Dong, MWD Consulting, Norwalk, Connecticut, USA Wouldn't it be nice if a single generic high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method could be used for all small molecule drugs\u2014 not only for potency assays but also for International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)-compliant stability-indicating assays? The use of generic HPLC methods in pharmaceutical analysis is not new. For at least two decades, generic HPLC/ UV/mass spectrometry (MS) methods using 1-2 min ballistic gradients have been used successfully for high-throughput screening of combinatorial libraries and new drug candidates (1). Similar generic methods are also used in in-process control (IPC) analysis to support organic synthesis or in quality control of raw materials (2).

The rationales used in the justification of the selection of various parameters will be disclosed. Case studies to illustrate the versatility of this generic method approach by simple adjustments of gradient range and time in the development of stability-indicating assays will be presented. These examples will include quality assessments of many NCEs including complex drug molecules with multiple chiral centres (Figure 2). References 1) M. Wong, B. Murphy, J.H. Pease, and M.W.

Since the introduction of SPME in the early 1990s, the technique has become an established method for the analysis of fragrance and flavours, as well as an important tool for environmental analysis. Likewise, owing to the development of matrix-compatible coatings, the implementation of SPME for the analyses of semi- and nonvolatile compounds by direct immersion of SPME devices in complex matrices has been increasingly reported over the last 15 years (1). Over this time, biocompatible SPME, which refers to the technology where a biocompatible coating ensures effective sample clean-up during extraction from biological samples, has come a long way in demonstrating its flexibility in method optimization, and thus its applicational versatility (1,2). At first, the majority of biocompatible SPME applications considered the extraction of drugs from blood or plasma, urine, or later, from oral fluids\u2014usually in a high throughput and automated manner, but using fairly large (a few hundred microlitres) sample volumes. However, new breakthroughs in biocompatible SPME, such as the successful introduction 0.40 M235 - - 235.2 1.20 1.40 1.60 1.80 2.00 Time (min)2.20 2.40 2.60 2.80 3.00 3.40 3.60 3.80 4.00PDA (210-400)mm 4.20Colu mn: Surf ace charged hy brid C18 (2.7 m, 50 x 3 .0 mm) Mobile Ph.: A: 20 mM amm.

The 5-min method was obtained by adjustments of gradient parameters from the universal generic method, which took only one hour. 326 LCGC Europe June 2019HPLC 2019of in vivo SPME to animal studies, first to larger animals and soon after to rodents, have propelled the technology forwards by expanding its suitability to a wide range of biological applications. Currently, when ethical guidelines and legal regulations, such as the \"3Rs rule\" (Reduction, Replacement, Refinement), impose serious limitations on animal studies, technological improvements offering less invasive sampling methods, more informative analysis, or adequate surrogate in vitro models are in high demand. As a standard, the biotech and pharma industry generally use microsomal, two- and three-dimensional cell line culture models for the screening of drug candidates or new drugs at the early stage of the drug discovery and development process. Current methods for analysis of these cell culture models generally require high throughput in 96-, 384-, or 1536-well plates. The most commonly performed tests are performed to determine cytotoxicity, namely, to differentiate between apoptotic and necrotic cells, and thus do not impart any other biochemical information at the molecular level. In this respect, SPME may offer new possibilities by combining extraction with miniaturized SPME probes, which have so far mainly been used for manual sampling, with robotic systems operating in high-throughput mode for analysis of samples in a multiwell plates. Given the versatility that SPME offers in analysis, applications involving either targeted, fully quantitative analysis or untargeted screening can be implemented using this system. In the first case, the method needs to be carefully optimized to meet non-depletive extraction criteria (3) of the compound(s) or groups of compounds of interest, while in the latter, identification of unknown drug metabolites or the effect of a drug or drug candidate on a given cell line might be the goal of analysis. A given drug's effect on a living system can be assessed via observation of changes in small molecules; in other words, by assessing changes in the metabolomic or lipidomic profiles of the system. In fact, the first in vivo SPME metabolomic analysis in mice opened up new opportunities to capture short-lived and unstable species present in living systems\u2014a feat largely unachievable using traditional sample preparation methods, which are based on sample collection (4). powered by www.chromacademy.com /hplc_trou bleshooting.htm lTry it now for FREE @Become the lab expert with our interacti ve Get answers fast.

Although the small sample volumes in in vitro assays, or small blood vessels and organs in in vivo rodent studies require very short coating lengths, resulting in low extraction recovery of compounds, in the era of highly sensitive mass spectrometers (MS), such concerns are no longer an issue. Similar to SPME, mass spectrometers are multitasking instruments, therefore, such a combination may be used simultaneously for the analysis of drugs, their metabolites, contaminants, and endogenous metabolites. Another important feature of high-throughput SPME robots is the possibility of coupling this technology with automated liquid handlers, which operate on the same instrumental basis. The advantage of performing SPME with miniaturized probes or short and thin coating probes is the possibility of performing multiple samplings. Sequential sampling enables observation of changes in drug and metabolite concentrations over time or metabolome/lipidome profiles after a given stimuli, for example, drug administration (5). Irrespective of the type of research being performed, be it an in vitro cell line study or in vivo animal experiments, a multiple sampling SPME approach allows for large reductions in the number of biological replicates as well as a decrease in inter-animal and inter-subcultural cell variability (6). By affording novels strategies for research, such as the coupling of targeted and untargeted analysis, enabling temporal as well as spatial resolution, and facilitating both cell line research as well as in vivo investigations in small animals, such as rodents, SPME opens new doors for the biotech and pharma industry in terms of a simplified approach to drug discovery, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD), and IVIVE study. Similar to the drug discovery and development procedure mentioned previously, clinical applications contain a wide variety of protocols, from therapeutic drug monitoring to the search and determination of disease biomarkers. Some of the features that an ideal technology must have are similar to those needed for the previously described applications: low invasiveness, small sample size sampling capability, reproducibility, quantitation of compounds of interest, and sterile single-use or sterilizable devices. While easily accessible matrices such as blood or urine do not often require the use of small-sample sampling devices or in vivo sampling, analysis from a few microlitres of such samples would nonetheless be beneficial for certain patient populations, where access to the vein or frequent sample collection is restricted, such as newborns, elderly patients, or those suffering from certain diseases or disorders. In addition, the timeframe of analysis is of crucial importance in clinical operations, given that some results must be made available to clinicians in as close to real time as possible. Here, SPME follows the current trend in direct coupling of sampling devices with analytical instrumentation. Several approaches have been proposed, with two\u2014coated blade spray (CBS) and microfluidics open interface (MOI)\u2014gaining particular interest and showing great potential for future practical use within the clinical environment (1,7). However, while many protocols involving different methods have already been established and are constantly introduced for the analysis of biofluids, direct biochemical tissue analysis offers less analytical options. Without a doubt, since the first introduction of mass spectrometers as potential diagnostic tools in surgical units, sampling and sample introduction tools compatible with MS have been garnering increased interest from the medical community (8-10). Common features of these techniques include real-time analysis and limited spatial resolution. The limit in spatial resolution concerns the extractive capability of these techniques\u2014for the above techniques, extraction is limited to the tissue surface because analysis of structures located deeper within the system cannot be performed without prior tissue injury. Conversely, while SPME-MS cannot be considered as a \"real time\" tool because it requires a few minutes for extraction and desorption, the technique may be used for probing structures located under the tissue surface, for example, inside organs undergoing surgical procedures. Intraoperative SPME analyses have been reported in a porcine model, and, most recently, in humans as part of clinical studies (1). Recent applications include determination of drug concentration and distribution during local chemotherapy in lungs during in vivo perfusion, untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics of brain discovery, and chemical biopsy of kidney grafts for assessment of organ quality prior to transplantation. Until now, untargeted analysis following in vivo sampling has been performed off site in the analytical laboratory; however, ongoing studies are focused on optimizing protocols for onsite determination of levels of biomarkers and monitoring of drug concentrations so that results can be provided to clinicians in close to real time.

The Bene ts of a Liquid- Electron Liquid Chromatography-Mass Achille Cappiello, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, Italy From its development in 2016, the liquid-electron ionization (LEI) liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (1) interface has demonstrated a high versatility, offering the identification advantages of library-searchable, electron ionization (EI) spectra from samples in a liquid phase. The LEI concept is an innovative approach that efficiently manages the problematic conversion of a liquid phase into a gas phase (a mandatory requirement of EI). LEI only tolerates sub-microlitre-per-minute flow rates, so the use of a nano-LC (nLC) system is highly recommended. Higher flow rates would impact the ion source vacuum, which reduces sensitivity and filament lifetime. An excess of solvent vapours would also induce chemical ionization (CI) reactions with the formation of (M+H) + ions that would affect the quality of the mass spectrum. LEI is an advance in LC-EI-MS performance (2), offering reliable and straightforward solutions for small-molecule applications. Identification of unknowns is of increasing importance in food safety, environmental, forensic, and many other applications where the complexity of the matrix is a troubling factor. The advantage of EI for tentative identification is unparalleled and provides an attractive alternative to high-resolution and high mass accuracy at a lower cost. A simple interfacing process and negligible solvent consumption makes LEI compatible with different types of liquid-phase introduction, including ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC), normal phase, and buffer-assisted separations, and is capable of detecting a large number of compounds, regardless of their polarities. The gas-phase ionization process and the negligible matrix effects allow real-time detection of target compounds without a sample preparation step (when possible). In particular, this new approach offers strong matrix effects mitigation, full-scan, library-searchable EI spectra, and sensitive detection of nonpolar compounds, which are usually excluded by other LC-MS methods. None of the other available ionization techniques can analyze mixtures of substances in a range of polarities that spans from sugars to hydrocarbons in the same analysis. Notably, the less-polar species would require a separate gas chromatography (GC)-MS analysis, with additional costs, complexity, and time. Despite the complex interfacing process, LEI is carefully designed not to introduce modifications in the chromatographic profile, and its presence is completely unnoticeable and does not induce peak broadening. The quality of the mass spectrum is not influenced by mobile phase residues and matches the one obtained with GC-MS instruments. A specially designed vaporization chamber, called a vaporization micro-channel , physically separates the 330 LCGC Europe June 2019HPLC 2019vaporization from the ionization step, allowing independent optimization of both processes without any particular compromise. The micro-channel is the core of the interface. Here the liquid sample is smoothly converted to the gas phase. The narrow and long shape of the chamber ensures a fast conversion and quick transfer of the sample vapours to the ion source, reducing the chances of thermal decomposition to a minimum. The transfer block that holds and guides the vaporization micro-channel to the ion source can be heated up to 400 \u00b0C, depending on the boiling point of the analytes. Nonvolatile sample residues remain as deposits inside this channel, reducing ion source contamination from complex samples. The fused-silica vaporization micro-channel is chemically inert and performs very well; it is easy and cheap to replace when needed for a hassle-free and inexpensive periodic maintenance of the system. Our recent work has been oriented to explore the versatility of LEI in various directions: i) enhancing the performance towards high-molecular-weight compounds; ii) rapid detection applications without LC separation; and iii) real-time monitoring of reactions and processes. Despite the reliance upon gas-phase ionization, the range of substances that can be effectively ionized by LEI is more extensive than GC-MS. The combination of fast heat transfer to the analyte and efficient vaporization drastically reduces the chance of thermal decomposition, allowing the detection of many GC- and LC-amenable analytes (3). The effect of different surface materials in the vaporization micro-channel is under investigation. Recent preliminary results demonstrate that \"glass-like\" ceramic is a promising alternative to stainless steel and fused silica as a vaporization surface. Poorly volatile compounds are readily available in the gas phase when ceramic is used. High cost and fragility still limit its use as a valid substitute for fused silica. LEI has been successfully combined with condensed phase membrane introduction mass spectrometry (CP-MIMS) for on-line measurements in complex samples (4). Semipermeable membranes, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), are used to transfer neutral analytes by a condensed (liquid) acceptor phase to an MS system for real-time detection and quantitation. Ions and heterogeneous compounds cannot cross the membrane and do not reach the MS system. LEI paired with CP-MIMS allows the kinetics of organic reactions to be monitored on-line: neutral molecules can permeate the hydrophobic silicone membranes and are ionized under EI conditions. A chronogram allows the amounts of reagents and products over time to be monitored. Food safety, forensic analyses, and quality control are analytical fields where MS plays a fundamental role, especially when focused on a targeted approach. Most protocols are based on LC-ESI-MS; however, the broad variability of these matrices needs a dedicated method for every sample, with an increase in complexity, time, and material consumption. LEI offers a technical solution that is not affected by matrix effects. This critical aspect may open the door to high-speed analytical protocols based on a \"dilute-and-shoot\" approach for semiquantitative, fast detection of specific analytes without chromatography. Extra-virgin olive (EVO) oil is one of the main components of the Mediterranean diet, thanks to its micronutrients content; phenols such as hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol are two of the most representative ones. We tested LEI-MS on several oil samples that were diluted and injected directly in the interface without any pretreatment. The two phenols of interest were detected and quantified. The complex olive oil matrix neither interferes with the quantitation of the analytes nor with the performance of the nLC-MS system, ensuring several consecutive analyses without loss of sensitivity or need of maintenance procedures.

E: 11enc@chemistry.pt W: http://11enc.eventos.chemistry.pt Marco SilvaEVENTSSolving Recovery Problems in SPE A guide to solving recovery problems in solid-phase extraction (SPE) Problems with quantitation in solid-phase extraction (SPE) may be associated with an inability to recover target analytes or internal standards from the extraction sorbent. These problems may be the result of poor choices in the chemistry of the protocol, or issues with the processing of the method. The choice of sorbent chemistry is very important, and, to achieve the optimum extraction selectivity, one needs to choose a sorbent based on the analyte and matrix component chemistry. It is very useful to know the LogP/LogD values and p Ka values wherever possible. In general terms, the specificity of the sorbent-analyte interaction increases in the following order: non-functionalized polymer sorbents hydrophobic sorbents (such as C18, C8, CN; more polar sorbents are more selective) polar functionalized polymeric sorbents strong or weak ion-exchange sorbents mixed mode sorbents (silica or polymer hydrophobic materials with ion-exchange functional groups) The strength of electrostatic interactions between analytes and sorbent, some 15 times stronger than simple hydrophobic interactions, means that sorbents containing ion-exchange moieties are likely to give the most selective extraction under most circumstances. Of course, although the ability of the sorbent to retain the analyte is of great importance, one also needs to consider the requirement to selectively elute the analyte, which again requires knowledge of the analyte chemistry and the interactions with the sorbent. For the avoidance of doubt: in solid-phase extraction, the ability to be selective invariably equates to the extent of analyte recovery. To ensure optimum analyte retention, one should consider both the sample diluent and the sorbent equilibration solvent. If an analyte is loaded in a solvent that is too highly eluting, then analyte breakthrough may occur or final elution volumes may be larger than necessary. For hydrophobic sorbents (and analytes), use a sample diluent with as little organic solvent as possible to ensure sample solubility. If the sorbent requires a conditioning (wetting) step, which is typically 100% organic solvent, ensure that an equilibration step is used to lower the elutropic strength of the solvent within the sorbent bed prior to the sample loading step. If ion-exchange sorbents are used, the pH of the sample diluent should be adjusted to ensure target analytes are in their ionized form before loading. Similarly, the pH of the equilibration solvent should be adjusted to ensure that any weak ion-exchange ligands are in the charged form (the p K a of weak ion-exchange sorbents can be obtained from the manufacturer's literature), to promote efficient retention of the target analytes. Further, one should consider loading the sample at a lower flow rate than is usual, because of the point-to-point nature of the electrostatic interactions in ion exchange, which require some degree of molecular orientation to occur, and therefore are inherently slower than other retention mechanisms. It may be necessary to include a \"soak\" time, in which the flow is stopped and the sample remains stationary within the sorbent bed to maximize analyte retention and prevent poor analyte recovery. Soak times of 30 s to several minutes can be necessary to ensure optimum recovery, and can be used with all types of sorbents. Wash solvents, used to selectively elute interferences from the sorbent while retaining the analyte, should be strong enough to obtain the cleanest extract possible. However, care needs to be taken to avoid analyte breakthrough. Optimization of wash solvent strength should be performed by titrating the elution strength in discrete steps over several tubes or wells containing the same nominal analyte amount, plotting the solvent strength against analyte recovered, choosing the highest solvent strength that does not contain any analyte response. Remember here also that the organic solvent type and composition can be used in tandem with solution pH and ionic strength in order to achieve a \"strong\" wash solvent that removes a large amount of sample matrix components but does not cause analyte breakthrough. The \"mixed-mode\" phases are particularly useful in this respect because the dominant retention mechanism can be \"flipped\" between hydrophobic and hydrophilic/electrostatic using pH and solvent strength, resulting in improved sample cleanliness and recovery. Similarly, the strength of the elution solvent should be optimized by evaluating successively stronger solvents, until one observes an unacceptable amount of interferences or background within the final eluate. Again, solvent strength, pH, and ionic strength should all be considered for optimization of elution strength, and soak steps may also be required to optimize recovery.
