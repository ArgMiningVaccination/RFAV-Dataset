Organised by the World Homeopathy Awareness Organisation, the week is a celebration of both homeopaths and those who have been healed with homeopathy. The date of 10th April was chosen to mark the start of this event as it is the birthday of Dr Samuel Hahnemann, the German physician who is credited with creating homeopathy. Homeopathy is a system of alternative medicine that uses small, highly diluted doses of natural substances to trigger the bodies own healing abilities. During the week, there are free public events held across the world, such as lectures, media interviews and free and reduced-price clinics. Information and testimonials about the use of homeopathy will also be shared on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter as well as in the mainstream media. The primary goals of World Homeopathy Awareness Week are to raise public awareness of homoeopathy and improve accessibility to homeopathy. The World Homeopathy Awareness Organisation is a not for profit organisation, run by volunteers.
