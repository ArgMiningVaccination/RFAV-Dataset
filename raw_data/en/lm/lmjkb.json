To bask in the warmth of the morning sun, to loose ourselves in the aroma of wildflowers, to pause as we listen to the sounds of birds singing, to dive into the refreshing elixir of a spring water creek, to elevate the senses through a refreshing bounty of hand foraged berries. These are the moments that make our soul sing. These are the practices that bring our body, mind and spirit back into alignment, that reconnect us with Mother Nature, our true home, and create a poetic resonance between our soul and our senses.\" - Chasca Summerville - Ayurvedic Rituals All clients that enter the beautiful surroundings of the Ceremony Space are smudged with white sage and incense to [bring clarity to the mind](https://life-enhancement.com/pages/spanish-sage-enhances-memory-improves-mood) and [clear positive ions](https://www.webmd.com/balance/features/negative-ions-create-positive-vibes) - inspired by the people of ancient Egypt, who used sage to [purify the air](https://greenmedinfo.com/article/medicinal-smoke-can-completely-eliminate-diverse-plant-and-human-pathogenic-ba) before beauty treatments. Smudging is the first step in all INDIRA treatments as a ritual to leave the mundane troubles of the everyday at the door, and get the best out of your session. Reviews - Jo During my recent annual visit to Whitby I found Michelle's sanctuary and booked in for a crystal treatment. Having never had a treatment of this kind I had no expectations. From the moment I walked into the treatment space I felt relaxed. Michelle is very personable. My experience was amazing, it grounded me and cleared my negative energies accumulated over a bad few years and gave me the strength I required to move forward. I can't recommend Michelle enough. I shall be making another visit without doubt. Thank you Michelle for you're healing. I wish you all the best & look forward to my next visit. - Chantil Had the most amazing treatment with Michelle. After following the Shepherd's Purse for a while, I took the plunge and booked in for the Goddess Awakening Crystal Ritual. The treatment was so relaxing, the environment and Michelle's persona was amazing. I totally relaxed into the treatment and felt myself drift off. I will definitely be booking when next visiting Whitby. Can highly recommend. If I lived locally I would become a regular visitor. See you soon Michelle "}
