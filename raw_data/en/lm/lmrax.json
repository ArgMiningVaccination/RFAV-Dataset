Abstract Pollution of the environment is a serious health concern faced by humanity which needs immediate tackling to protect our future generations. It is not an issue which should be left only to the Government or Environmentalists to deal with, each one of us have a responsibility to do our part. This health hazard is exacerbated by the fact that we are going away from nature's ways which is leading to life threatening diseases and unhealthy body. The new generation is so engrossed in social media that they are losing touch with the surroundings and themselves. Satya is a bold step towards addressing this problem and strives to bring people closer to nature and in the process bringing about self-realization and self-healing. Keywords: H ealth concern; Ayurveda treatment; Y oga; Satya Introduction In the contemporary scenario we are wrapped up in luxury, but nature's simple and elegant bounties are but a distant dream. \"SATYA - Svasthya Ayurveda treatment Y oga & Agriculture\" is found to accomplish this vision. Close to the lively town, away from the rush, this haven is situated at Athani, near Cochin International Airport Junction. Satya was created with a broad perspective to provide a holistic treatment for spiritual and physical health, to give a chance to artists to display their talent and ability, to bring together the environmentalists, for creating awareness about the importance of protecting the greenery as well as planting more trees. Meaning of Satya translates into \"Truth and honesty\" . But in a wider sense it has a deeper meaning. We have to live in synchronization with nature and truth, which will ensure peace of mind and contentment and this in turn will keep us in pink of health. If you are true to your own self you will find gratification and happiness. Only a sound mind c an give you a healthy body. Ayurveda and yoga [1-3] have a strong connection and together can work miracles in healing. SATYA provide holistic cure with a combination of Ayurveda, naturopathy [4], farming, music therapy, Y oga and meditation. Bamboo beauty spa which is a part of Satya offers relaxing and r ejuvenating massages, hair and beauty treatments. This project is a comprehensive wellness center of superior s tandards and aims to provide a platform for the artists to showcase their talent, to give a farming experience to the new generation and to raise awareness for a cause we firmly believe in (planting more trees to s ave nature is our motto). We have planned space for art exhibitions, painting camps, yoga camps and a charity shop for plantation of trees. At Satya, you will find an eclectic fusion of rich ayurvedic history and m odern comfort. 'Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.' These wise w ords spoken centuries back by Hippocrates are very relevant today.Most of the people are leading an unhealthy lifestyle eating unhealthy f ood which is the root cause of many diseases and aches. Rather than following a healthy way of life which could keep their bodies healthy, they prefer to wait for the ailment to strike and then run to get medical help. We have an obligation towards our body; please do not overload the system with pesticide laden food and junk food that is difficult to dig est. Be kind to your digestive system. Paying slight attention to what you eat can go a long way in keeping you in good physical shape. Many of the diseases like Cancer, diabetes, cardiac troubles, pulmonary issues, allergies, hypertension [5] were uncommon and found only among a few before, but these conditions have become rampant now. We need to find the root of these problems and uproot t hem so as to avoid a sick and unhealthy future generation. External influences like pollution is beyond control, so let us at least do what we can. Nature has endowed us with nutritious produce, let us try not to poison these gifts with pesticides and manipulate it with g enetic modifications. Organic farming should to be more extensive an d widely prevalent. At Satya, there is an organic garden and farm which houses many exotic fruit trees, vegetable plants, birds and animals. The soil is the great connector of lives; it is the healer and restorer, b y which disease passes into health, age into youth and death into life. I do the farming for the passion of farming. I find peace and solace when surrounded by plants trees and anim als, I relish toiling in the open air, taking delight in the weather absorbing the vitamin D from the sunlight. V itamin D deficiency [6,7] i s so rampant now days for the simple reason being that we do not get enough sunlight on our body. Agriculture is considered to the noblest of all vocation, but sadly farmers don't get their due even though they toil hard to feed the society. It is not an impossible or laborious task to cultivate a tiny organic garden with herbs and vegetables at your place and the outcome is not only healthy but very rewarding.

Spending time with nature and breathing fresh air can be a great idea to rejuvenate and heal your body and mind. Conclusion Along with healthy food, physical activity is a must for healthy living, at Satya, there are classes for Barathanatyam, kalarippayattu, weight cut back program at the fitness center \"All that man needs for health and healing has been provided by God in nature, the Challenge of science is to find it.\" Paracelsus was wise enough to give such a statement in 15th century and we living in 21st century are still foolish not to accept this fact.
