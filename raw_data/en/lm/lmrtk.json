Complete with customized calorie and simple meal prep recipes to try.", "sitename": "Trifecta", "date": "2020-07-18", "cleaned_text": "How to Use this Clean Eating Meal Plan Listed below you'll find a three-week menu with dietitian-approved breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and snacks. Each week provides a grocery list, meal schedule, and links to all recipes. This plan does not include any beverages, so if you are drinking anything that contains calories, this will impact your daily nutrition - just be sure to track it! I recommend cooking a majority of the meals in advance using a [weekly meal prep routine]. Use the shopping list to plan ahead before you hit the grocery store, and buy all of your ingredients in one haul. Then choose a day or two that works for you and pre-cook and portion your meals for the week. Customizing Your Clean Eating Meal Plan This meal plan is built for a 1500-calorie plan. All you need to do is multiply the portions to match your calorie needs. For example, if you need 1800 calories per day, you'll need to increase portions by 20%. Just multiply all ingredients by a factor of 1.2 and your set! Or if you need fewer calories, such as a 1200-calorie meal plan, you'll need to decrease portions by 20% and multiply all your ingredients by a factor of 0.8. Tracking your daily intake using a [nutrition app], is the easiest way to ensure you are staying on top of your calories consistently. Food Preferences and Allergies The [best diet for you](/what-diet-is-best-for-me-quiz) is the one you enjoy eating! So if you're not into some of the suggested meal options, feel free to make substitutions. This plan is [gluten-free](/health/gluten-free-diet-how-to-eat-healthy-gluten-free) and usually only whole foods, but does include some dairy from yogurt and cottage cheese. You can easily swap in your favorite [dairy alternatives](/blog/dairy-alternatives-8-ways-to-ditch-milk-yogurt-and-cheese) if needed but note this will likely decrease the total protein amount. To make this soy-free, just swap in your favorite soy-free teriyaki sauce and you're all set! Cheat Meals This plan does include some wiggle room with snacks! If you have a hankering for a treat or want to include beverages, you can easily swap out some of the snack options. While I don't recommend including more than a couple of \" [cheats](/blog/best-cheat-meals-cutting)\" a week, using this approach will allow you to splurge a bit without blowing up your calorie control for the week.
