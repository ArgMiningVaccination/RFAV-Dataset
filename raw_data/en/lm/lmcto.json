They exist! Here's the best plastic free, refillable and compostable options on the market.", "sitename": "Greenify Me", "date": "2021-11-05", "cleaned_text": "I'm all about wellness of self = equals wellness of planet. After all, how can we care for the environment if we're not here to do it? I'll never compromise my health - and that includes when it comes to plastic packaging. However, there are several companies out there who are dedicated to creating zero waste vitamins and supplements. They make my life (and now yours) a heck ton easier! Zero waste to me means innovative packaging that helps reduce waste. That doesn't always mean completely plastic free, but it does mean less virgin plastic. Conventional vitamins and supplements are often packaged in single-use virgin plastic. This isn't sustainable. However, the packaging these sustainable vitamins I've rounded up use is completely innovative and better for the planet. Most of them do their best to completely avoid plastic through glass or compostable packaging, some offer refill subscriptions, and some use no virgin plastics (aka recycled plastic!) in their packaging. All of which is better than virgin plastic. FYI, using [recycled plastic](https://www.wastedive.com/news/apr-recycled-plastics-reduce-energy-consumption-ghg-emissions/547027/) cuts emissions over virgin material by 67% for PET, 71% for HDPE, and 71% for PP. Before I go any further, I would just like to say that I am not a medical professional and therefore will not make any health recommendations here. I am simply showing you to potential options, but I highly recommend you speak to a doctor or dietician to ensure that any vitamins or supplements you take are right for you and your body's needs.

Supplements are things you can take to help ensure vital substances are in your body, which you may otherwise be lacking. Supplements can vary from vitamins and minerals, essential to the effective running of your body to other forms such as herbs which may help to reduce disease, or boost bodily functions. Some people use supplements to ensure that their bodies are effectively receiving all of the requirements to satisfy their body's nutritional needs. Supplements can come in many forms from liquids, powders, tablets and even candy. Some will work more effectively for some people than others. Is supplement same as vitamin? Not exactly. A supplement is anything you add to your diet to ensure there is added nutritional value. This could be all sorts from minerals, herbs, oils or vitamins. Where as a vitamin in itself is a specific type of supplement. Similarly, a vitamin doesn't have to be found in supplement form, vitamins are found readily in fruits, vegetables and even from sunlight! What vitamins are most vegans lacking? The big one is vitamin B12. This is a vitamin primarily found in animal products such as meat, dairy and eggs. Having said that, being vegan definitely does not mean that you are necessarily deficient in B12, as this can be found in other things such as nutritional yeast - which is fortified with B12. Other common vitamins that vegans maybe lacking, although not always, are vitamin D, iron, iodine, calcium and zinc. While a vegan or even vegetarian diet can be super healthy, it is important to make sure you are getting all of the right vitamins and minerals your body needs. While there are several options when it comes to this, including eating foods fortified with vitamins, you can also take zero waste vitamins and supplements to ensure you are super healthy. If you are unsure, always speak to your doctor. Are vegan vitamins good for you? It is only ever recommended by health professionals to take vitamins that you actually need. While many people take supplements on a daily basis, such as a multivitamin, many don't actually need them, and in some cases can actually cause adverse effects. With anything in life it is important to get the balance right. If it has been recommended by a doctor or other health care professional, that you should take vitamin supplements, then absolutely it is good for you. As I mentioned above, with a vegan diet, there is the possibility of lacking in certain nutrients if the vegan diet is not properly planned. Having said that, it is possible to get vitamins from other sources so don't always assume that due to specific dietary requirements, you aren't having the correct vitamins. If you are ever in doubt, I would highly recommend speaking to your doctor or a dietician. What can I do with empty glass vitamin bottles? You can recycled them - if your town recycles glass jars (some don't!), but before you do that, think about how you can repurpose them in your home. I personally love smaller jars, like vitamin bottles. I have a bunch in my shed, which helps me keep my seeds in order. If you don't have a garden, you can use them to store buttons, nails, pins, and any small knock knacks you have. If the jar is big enough, you can even use it to store DIYs. Another thing I love to do is keep small jars for when I am travelling, they are great to put toothpaste tablets in, or enough coconut oil to last me for my trip. If you are a bit more creative than me you could even use them for crafting! I have seen tons of ideas on Pinterest from candle holders to adorable snowmen crafts for children! The sky really is the limit, so don't automatically toss your empty vitamin bottles into the trash. Are there zero waste prenatal vitamins? Yes absolutely! There are several zero waste prenatal vitamins out there, including some from the brands mentioned on this list. For pregnant women, prenatal vitamins are a must, especially folic acid. Of the ones mentioned below, make sure you take a look at [MegaFood](https://fave.co/3nZ32Ws) and [Wild Nutrition](https://fave.co/3ELPQuI) which have ranges specifically made for use during pregnancy. What to look for in a zero waste vitamin or supplement? Look for high quality ingredients that are sustainably sourced, and packaged in reusable or recyclable materials. It's also important to look at the ethics of the company as a whole. Brands that are giving back through 1% for the Planet or through B Corp Certifications really stand out to me. Conventional vitamins come packaged in a lot of plastic so be on the lookout for brands that are mindful of this and promote more circular economies. For instance, I like to ensure that no single use plastic is used and that any packaging is compostable. In terms of specific supplements, I don't know your personal circumstances or needs. However, here are some companies I recommend having a look at, after speaking to a healthcare professional to determine which zero waste vitamins and supplements are best for you. Below I've rounded up 17 of the best sustainable supplements and vitamins on the market. I've listed which are vegan-friendly, UK based, and what their product packaging looks like in the features. 1. [Seed](https://fave.co/3GUdsze) - Vegan probiotic - Subscription service - Scientific Approach - Shipped in biodegradable algae paper - Reusable glass jar + travel vial - Compostable refill pouches - Dissolvable Corn-Based Barrier Foam If you are a bit of a science nerd like me, you are going to LOVE [Seed](https://fave.co/3GUdsze). They explain in serious detail exactly how the capsules are constructed and why. It really is an innovative product and perfect for anyone wanting to take a single probiotic and not have to worry about which tablets or powders you have to take and when. All of the packaging for the product has been designed with the planet in mind and is totally plastic free and home compostable! 2. [Wild Nutrition](https://fave.co/3mLPBK3) - Various Tablet Supplements - Vegan Options Available - Available worldwide - Glass Jars - B Corp Certified - Pregnancy Range The founder of Wild Nutrition is a highly regarded nutritionist and has a deep respect for nature. Due to the fact there was no company she could wholeheartedly recommended, she decided, with her husband to set up her own company. Now the products are available worldwide - in over 50 countries, B Corp certified and you can even search by specific health goal. 3. [Aura Inner Beauty](https://fave.co/3BQtkPk) - Supplement Elixir - Vegan Options Available - Gorgeous Flavors - Organic - Non-GMO Aura Inner Beauty is a Canadian based company who have developed these awesome, and quite frankly gorgeous looking, supplement elixirs. Something I love about these are that you can just add them to your morning coffee and they come in so many lush flavors it's like adding something a little special to brighten your morning. Not all of their products are liquids, there are also oils and powders. 4. [Sun Potion](https://fave.co/3o26bo7) - Wide Range of Supplements - US based - Vegan Options Available - All Single Ingredient Extracts - Organic and Fairly Sourced [Sun Potion](https://fave.co/3o26bo7) probably has the widest range of zero waste vitamins and supplements on the market with vegan options available too. You can be sure that all of their products are organic and fairly sourced. If you are a bit of a supplement expert, this is definitely a place you need to check out. They have just about every supplement you could ever want, and you can get them with the knowledge that the products will arrive in a reusable glass jar, and all the ingredients have been consciously sourced. 5. [Moon Juice](https://fave.co/3BOTCRY) - Juice, Milks, Tonics and Treats Supplements - Handmade Daily - Vegan Options Available - US Based - Female Owned - Virgin Plastic Free This brand comes from a truly remarkable story. The founder Amanda was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and was told she would never be able to go into remission... and she did! She developed [Moon Juice ](https://fave.co/3BOTCRY)from her kitchen through the needs of herself, from advice from experts and through the lack of products on the market to her standards. I absolutely love this story and I think it truly speaks to the standard of the products. 6. [The Beauty Chef](https://fave.co/3q7v18V) - Available World-Wide - Australian Based Company - Vegan Options Available - Glass bottle options - Clean ingredients - Promotes Healthy Skin and Gut For those of you out there who are new to supplements, I feel that [The Beauty Chef](https://fave.co/3q7v18V) could be a good place to start. They have an online quiz you can take to discover products which are most suitable to your own personal needs and even have bundles which can help you discover and try out new products. Another awesome thing is you can also search their website by health concern, which, again, is super useful for those of you who are new to supplement use. 7.

The jars themselves preserve the life of the product by being made of violet glass, to protect against UV light. The lids are made of sustainably harvested maple tree and there are refills available so the glass jars can be reused over and over again. The refills come in home compostable sachets and are super lightweight to minimize their carbon footprint. 8.

[Public Goods](https://fave.co/3ka7vnX) - Capsule Supplements - Plant a Tree with Every New Member - Vegetarian and Vegan Options - Growing Range of Supplements The sustainability focus of [Public Goods](https://fave.co/3ka7vnX) is summarized so well in their statement \"You don't have to be a Superhero to Save the Planet\". I love the way they focus on small actions to encourage you to play your part. All of their supplements are free from artificial colors, flavors, gluten, soy and dairy. They are releasing a wider range of supplements so it is definitely worth keeping an eye out, including Vitamin B12, D and Women's & Men's Specific Daily Capsules. On top of that, they also have a variety of CBD products, if that is something you are interested in. 12. [Hum](https://fave.co/3qbUdeC) - Capsule and Powder Supplements - Verified by Independent Labs - Bottles made from recycled Ocean Bound Plastic - Free from Artificial Colors - Personalized Nutritional Recommendations - Goal based supplements While this product is not plastic free, they do an amazing job of recycling ocean bound plastic, so if you are keen to avoid plastic entirely this one might not be for you.

There are three different, options available: Omega 3, Probiotic and Rainbow AntiOxidants. The products have been clinically proven to help with various conditions. Their probiotic, for example, has been proven to reduce skin acne and reduce the effects of UTIs. Definitely worth a try if you are looking for zero waste vitamins and supplements. 15.

If you are particularly concerned about keeping your supplements sugar free, Vegums might be a good option for you and I suggest you check out their sugar free range. All of the packaging from this company is completely plastic free which I love and each stage of the packaging is broken down on [their website here.](https://www.vegums.com/sustainability-at-vegums/) 16. [Bloom Omega](https://bloomomega.com/) - Omega 3 Supplement - Vegan Friendly - UK Based - Free From Microplastics - Sustainable Alternative to Fish Oils - From Natural Algae Despite what people think, Omega 3 doesn't actually come from fish... it comes from algae, which means that for those of you wishing to take an omega 3 supplement, for your heart or brain, you don't have to go without. In fact, using the omega 3 found in algae is actually far better for you and the microplastics found in fish, and has the same level of nutritional value. This is also a far more sustainable option than using fish oil, as it helps to combat the issue of over fishing. By using omega 3 from algae you avoid this issue entirely. 17. [Nothing Fishy](https://www.nothingfishy.co/) - Soft Gel Omega 3 Supplements - UK based - Natural and Sustainable - No Fishy After Taste - 100% Plant based and Vegan - Refill Scheme Available If you have ever had to take omega 3 supplements, you will be aware of the dreaded fishy burps, which trust me... are far from pleasant!

Nothing Fishy supplements come in a stylish jar with a cork lid, while running a refill scheme with compostable, letterbox friendly packaging!
