If administered properly by a trained pest control expert, termite treatments are not only effective, but completely safe for you and your family. Many methods used to eliminate termites involve chemicals that could be dangerous when not handled properly. When applied by an experienced professional, termite control products are quite safe and people do not typically suffer from any residual effects. If proper precautions are taken before and after termite treatment, no one in your home needs to worry about unsafe conditions. Termite Fumigation Process Termite fumigation is safe insofar that proper precautions and procedures are followed. To ensure this method is safe for all involved, it's important to adhere to the following procedures: - Preparing for Termite Fumigation: - Before fumigation begins, you will be instructed to make arrangements to have all people, pets, and plants removed from the home. - All food and medicine needs to be either removed from the home or sealed in airtight containers. - Any plants, fences, antennas, or other objects outdoors that could obstruct the tent must be removed in order to provide full access. - During Fumigation: - The property will be completely covered and sealed using tarps. A chemical gas will be administered, and fans will be used in order to thoroughly circulate the gas throughout the house. - Warning signs will be clearly posted around the home to keep neighbors away and prevent visitors. - Re-Entering After Fumigation: - After fumigation, the gas is cleared out using fans and opened ventilation areas around the tarps. - The structure will take a minimum of 12 hours to be completely aerated. - No one will be permitted to enter the building until our certified fumigators have deemed it completely safe.

Because fumigation is filled with chemicals, some pest control companies employ termite extermination techniques that are known to be less toxic. While fumigation is necessary for drywood termites, liquid termiticides and baiting systems are preferred for most other termites. Although not offered by all companies, some eco-friendly methods include orange oil, nematodes, fungi, sand, and borates (or borax). No matter the method used, a professional pest control expert will make sure it is administered in a way that is safe for you, your family, and your pets. "}
