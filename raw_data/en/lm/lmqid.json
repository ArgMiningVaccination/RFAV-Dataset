About the University TAMU opened its doors in 1876 as the state's first public institution of higher learning. Today, we stand as a research -intensive flagship university dedicated to sending Aggie leaders out into the world prepared to take on the challenges of tomorrow. The Unive rsity's purpose is to develop leaders of character dedicated to serving the greater good. Our purpose statement carries with it the responsibility, the traditions and the forward -thinking of Texas A&M exemplified by all who are associated with the universi ty \u2014 our faculty and staff, and our current and former students. This purpose can be defined by our six core values. 1. Excellence 2. Integrity 3. Leadership 4. Loyalty 5. Respect 6. Selfless Service Located in the heart of the Houston -Dallas -Austin triangle and with in a two -hour drive of 26 million of the state's 28 million residents, Texas A&M's main campus in College Station is home to more than 64,000 students. Another 5,200 are at the branch campuses in Galveston and Qatar and at the School of Law, Higher Educati on Center at McAllen, and Health Science Center locations across Texas. About the School Texas A&M University School of Nursing graduates are among the best -prepared baccalaureate and masters nurses in the nation, and they are highly sought after by 9 prospective employers. The first -time National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses\u00ae (NCLEX -RN) pass rates for BSN graduates have ranked 10 percentage points higher than both the Texa s and national average since the inception of the college in 2008. We have grown from 40 students admitted in 2008 to approximately 450 nursing students enrolled at two campuses: Bryan and Round Rock as well as having many students enrolled in distance edu cation programs. The college also has a resident recruiting presence in Lufkin and McAllen serving residents in East and South Texas for both undergraduate and graduate nursing students. Vision Our vision is to be a premier college of nursing , educating and empowering a diverse population of nurse leaders who will transform health and health systems through service, discovery and knowledge. Mission The mission of the SON is to e ducate professional nurses of today and leaders of tomorrow through the provision of excellent educational programs in nursing. The SON will identify, attract and graduate students of high potential, especially those from groups who have been historically under -represented in Texas health care. Furthermore, this mission will facilitate individuals, families, and groups in achieving the maximum state of well -being through education of highly skilled nurses, research and service. The mission of the SON will be enhanced through faculty contributions to community service, leadership, practice and research. Goals In support of the vision and mi ssion, the SON is committed to the following educational goals: Develop within the student the knowledge and skills necessary for beginning professional nursing practice, cultivating basic and specialized abilities needed to pursue a successful career in the nursing profession. Promote the concept of nursing as holistic caring, and facilitate attainment of a care delivery system sensitive to multicultural communities and their health values. Use technology to facilitate and enhance student learning outcome s both inside and outside of the classrooms. Offer individuals the opportunity to increase the breadth and depth of the theoretical base for nursing practice, enhance and expand competence, prepare for role specialization, and utilize new nursing knowledge . 10 Provide an educational environment of respect within which students may evolve as broadly educated, responsible, and accountable professionals dedicated to the principles of lifelong learning. Serve the community as nursing experts, leaders and consultan ts in professional organizations, health promoters, providers of health care policy information, and advocates of ethical distribution and usage of resources. Provide educational opportunities that combine the expertise and skills of nursing students, medi cal students, future hospital administrators and public health professionals to promote collaborative partnerships and relationships on many levels. Contribute to the improvement of nursing education through innovation, evaluation, and participation in loc al to global nursing education activities. Philosophy The philosophy of the Texas A&M University School of Nursing reflects our beliefs about the role and the education of the professional nurse. This philosophy represents a blend of nursing theor ies. Professional Nursing Practice Nursing is a balance of both art and science. The art of nursing involves the concepts of caring that fosters respectful relationships and individual dignity and worth. The science of nursing is supported through inquir y, research and other scholarly activities and is manifested by evidence -based practice. The professional nurse is a partner and an advocate for the health care consumer in an increasingly diverse and aging population. Professional nursing provides cultura lly competent care to individuals, families and groups within their environments. Care of the physical, psychosocial and spiritual needs is essential to the promotion, protection and maintenance of health. The baccalaureate nurse functions in the roles of provider of care, coordinator of care, and contributor to the profession. Care is provided in and across all settings and health care systems, and uses a number of treatment modalities. As a provider of care, the nurse contributes a unique blend of knowled ge, skills, and caring. As a coordinator of care, the nurse has the knowledge and authority to delegate nursing tasks to other health care personnel and to supervise patient care outcomes. As a member of the profession, the nurse conforms to the laws and c ode of ethics governing professional standards of nursing practice. In all these roles, the professional nurse accepts personal responsibility for lifelong learning. 11 Professional Nursing Education Nursing education is a collaborative process among students, faculty, and the learning environment. It draws from the fields of physical and social science and liberal arts to support the acquisition of knowledge and skills essential for nurses to meet client, family, organization, and system needs. Course and clinical experiences throughout the curriculum are designed from simple to complex, beginning with foundational courses in liberal arts and sciences which are then built upon in nursing classes. Expected Student Outcomes Baccalaureate graduates of the SON will: Provide Care 1. Integrate concepts, models, and theories of nursing, the humanities and the natural, psychological, and sociological sciences as the foundation for professional nursing practice. 2. Apply concepts and theories as a base for problem solving decision making and critical reasoning in evidenced based nursing practice. 3. Use effe ctive and therapeutic communication in formal and informal interaction with clients, colleagues and other members of health care team. 4. Utilize the nursing process in the holistic care of diverse individuals, families, groups, communities and populations i n various healthcare settings. 5. Apply current standards of professional nursing practice in providing care to individual, families, groups, communities and populations. Manage Care 6. Utilize leadership and management skills while implementing safety principl es to create a safe, caring environment for care delivery. 7. Use information management and patient care technology in the delivery of health care. Participate as a Member of the Profession 8. Collaborate with other interprofessional health care team members to provide health promotion and disease and injury prevention across the lifespan for individuals, families, groups, communities, and populations. 9. Modify care and advocate for patients in reflecting current and changing healthcare systems, health policie s and global health care factors. 10. Demonstrate ethical accountability and legal responsibility for professional practice. 11. Integrate professional nursing values of altruism, autonomy, human dignity, integrity and social justice in professional nursing pract ice. 12 12. Demonstrate accountability for lifelong learning and professional growth.

Public information includes: a student's name, home address (including coun try), local address, telephone numbers, classification, enrollment status, major, dates of attendance, date and place of birth, photos and other types of media, degrees, certificates, and other awards received, the name of the institutions previously atten ded, and medical residence location and specialization. Directory information that holds student information may be made public unless the student desires to withhold any or all of this information. If a student does not wish for this public information to be released, the student is responsible for notifying the Office of the Registrar during the first week of classes to ensure that information is not released. A request to withhold public information remains in effect until revoked in writing. This requ est does not apply when an emergency occurs that indicates that the student is a danger to others or themselves or in the case of an FBI request that complies with the Family and Compliance Office that administers Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act (F ERPA). Within the institution, information from students' educational records is given without the consent of the student to administrative officials, faculty members and their staff, only for legitimate purposes in the students' educational interests.

However, information in student records may be provided to parents without the written consent of the student if the eligible student is a financial dependent of his or her parents as defined under Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. For more information, go to FERPA Notice to Students . Attendance, Absences and Makeups Students are responsible for learning the content of any course of stud y, including material presented in the classroom. Class participation and attendance are expected of each student. If a student should miss a class, they should email the faculty member and/or the Course Leader as soon as possible. If the absence is antici pated such as due to illness or personal emergency, the student should notify the immediate faculty member and/or the Course Leader prior to the start of the class/lab to be missed. For an injury or illness of three or more days, the student should obtain a medical confirmation note from his or her medical provider. Reference individual course syllabi regarding clinical absences and makeups for clinical experiences. Should you request an extended absence, please speak to an advisor. See Student Rule 7 for more information regarding excused, unexcused and extended absences. The instructor reserves the right to request satisfactory evidence to substantiate the reason for absence for bereavement: death or major illness in a student's immediate family.

Awareness of and Respect for Diversity TAMU and the SON fully support an environment wherein individuals (i.e., students, staff, faculty, guests) can work as partners in achieving goals. While engage d in didactic learning and experiential rotations, students are required to behave and act in a manner that is 18 expected in nursing and all health professions. Such behavior and actions are guided by respect for other students, faculty, staff, patients, an d health care professionals who may have differences that include (but are not limited to) the following: religious beliefs and practices, nontraditional medical beliefs and practices, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, ethnicity, language, physical and emotional disabilities, racial background, intellectual capabilities, age, and cultural background. Respect is demonstrated by being considerate, courteous, and professional, and by maintaining confidentiality of patient information. Child Care Gui delines No child care facilities are available in the SON . Each faculty member will set their own classroom policies regarding children in the classroom. Under no circumstances wil l children be allowed in the clinical settings or in the simulation lab. Clinical Learning Resource Center (Simulation Lab) The Clinical Learning Resource Center (CLRC) on the Bryan and Round Rock Campus es offer a simulation laboratory available to students with a state -of-the-art emergency room, infant and adult patient simulators, and other training tools. Students utilize th is facility for clinical experience and may schedule use as needed after hours to practice a variety of clinical skills. The patient simulators are always treated like real patients to foster the caring nature of healthcare professionals. These simulators are capable of mimicking signs and symptoms of almost any medical condition including a 'Code Blue' situation (cardiac and/or respiratory arrest). Scenarios simulating real patient encounters with students and patient simulators can be recorded to permit a debriefing with their instructor after completion of a scenario. Communication Expectations Student Rule 61 rule establishes e -mail as a n official means of communication (equivalent to the U.S. Postal Service) at TAMU . It also establishes student responsibilities for use of official TAMU e -mail accounts and official e -mail correspondence. All use of e -mail will be consistent with Student Rules, Computing Services: Rules for Responsible Computing. Upon a student's admi ssion to TAMU , they will be assigned an active student e -mail account within five working days. It then becomes the responsibility of the student to access this e - mail account in a responsible and timely manner. Course documents are submitted through the Learning Management System assignment links. Do not submit assignments through email unless specifically directed to do so by faculty. 19 Exposure to Chemicals All students in laboratory courses will be required to complete a lab safety training course. Any pregnant student, or student planning to become pregnant, should consult their health care provider to determine what, if any, additional precautions are needed based on their individual situation. It is the responsibility of the student to communicate the ir needs to the program coordinator or Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Nursing Education as soon as possible in order for risk -reduction to begin when it can be most effective, and to determine if additional modifications are necessary. While the universi ty cannot mandate that the student notify it if pregnant or planning to become pregnant, the university strongly recommends that students do provide notification so appropriate steps can be taken to ensure the health of both parent and child. Students wit h latex allergies must notify their instructors each term. Identification Badge All new students are asked to upload a photo in the CastleBranch compliance portal. Students in traditional face -to-face programs must also submit online photos to receive your Aggie ID Card. Badges may be picked up at the General Services Complex. You are required to bring a government issued photo identification to pick up your University student badges. Students will be issued a first name only photo ID badge by the SON . RN to BSN students will receive their badge in the mail. SON ID badges must be worn at all times in all clinical settings when performing student related activities. Wearing a badge is an issue of security and safety, as well as a requirement for the a gency and the university. Any student who forgets their ID badge will not be allowed to participate in clinical until they present with proper identification. Students are not to wear their clinical ID badge outside the classroom/clinical setting. In addi tion to the university and the clinical ID badge, students who attend classes on the Bryan -College Station and the Round Rock campuses will receive a building access badge provided by the Office of Student Affairs. Legal Violations Any student charged with a crime, with or without conviction, must notify the Ass istant Dean for Student Affairs (ADSA) within 72 hours. Failure to disclose could result in disciplinary action. Some convictions such as fraud, abuse, or assault may result in being unable to be licensed as a nurse. Each situation must be assessed for further action. Note: future employment as a registered nurse may be limited in some states based on legal convictions. 20 Religious Holy Days As defined in the Texas State Law , a \"reli gious holy day\" means a holy day observed by a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property taxation. The SON will excuse a student from attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religi ous holy day, including travel for that purpose. A student who is absent from classes for the observation of a religious holy day will be allowed to take an exam or complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time after the absence. T he language of House Bill 256 was adopted into Texas A&M Student Rules, Appendix IV: Excused Absences for Religious Holy Days . Students are asked, but not required, to request absence from the class in writing (email acceptable).It would be most helpful if the student would submit the request to each course leader within the first 5 days of the semester for which the absence is requested. A student who is excused for holy day observance may not be penalized for the absence, but the instructor may appropriately respond if the student fails to satisfactorily complete the assignment or examination within a timely manner. For a list of holy days and their de scription, view The Interfaith Calendar and the PBS Multifaith Calendar . Title IX and Sexual Violence/Harassment Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs and activities at institutions that receive federal financial assistance. Sexual violence, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence or stalking can happen to anyone. Texas A&M wants to make sure you have resources available to help you or someone you know who has been impacted by sexual violence, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence or stalking. There are many services available to support students, faculty and staff in crisis. Call the Office of Student Affairs at 979 -436-0110 for assistance or contact the Sexual Assault Resource Center in the Bryan/College Station area directly by calling 979 -731-1000. The Sexual Assault Resource Center's goal is to stop sexual violence through advocacy, empowerment, and education. SARC offers a 24hour crisis hotline, 24hour accompaniment to medical fac ilities, accompaniment to meet with law enforcement or court appearances, provides free counseling to survivors and family members or survivors of sexual assault, and makes professional and educational presentations to schools, businesses, and other agenci es. In the Round Rock location, you may contact the Hope Alliance Center at 512 -255-1212. This center is dedicated to empowering victims of family violence, sexual assault, and other violent crimes through support and advocacy, while promoting community aw areness, compassion, and responsibility for creating a safer community. The staff assists victims in finding counseling, 21 housing and employment, and works closely with law enforcement agencies, hospitals, and others involved in crisis intervention. Student Assistance Services can help to identify or provide assistance. Other resources are available on the Step In/Stand Up website . The Office of the Dean of Student Life, the Human Resources Department employee relations office, and the Office of the Dean of Faculties are available to serve as resources to any student, non -faculty employee, or faculty member who has a sexual harassment inquiry or complaint. A person who believes he or she has been the victim of sexual harassment may pursue either the informal or the formal complaint resolution procedure. Any faculty member, staff member, or student may initiate a complaint. For more information, see Student Rule 47 . Smoking Policy All buildings and vehicles, regardless of location, t hat are owned or leased under the administrative purview of the president of Texas A&M University will be entirely smoke - free. This smoke -free rules will apply to all indoor air space, including foyers, entryways and classrooms, individual faculty and admi nistrative offices. Many clinical settings have their own smoking policies. Students are expected to abide by the rules of each institution. A violation of this policy is considered unprofessional conduct and can result in disciplinary action leading to pr ofessional probation. Violators will be subject to disciplinary action. For more details on this policy, see Student Rule: Appendix IX . Social Media Policy The University presence or participation on social media sites is guided by university policy. This policy applies to SON students who engage in internet conversations for school - related purposes or school -related activities such as interactions in or about clinical and didactic course activities. Distribution of sensitive and confidential information is protected under HIPAA and FERPA whether discussed through traditional communication channels or through social media. The American Nurses Association (ANA) provides Social Networking Principles to guide nurses in the use of social media to safeguard themselves, the profession, and their patients. Examples of social m edia include Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube, to name a few. The following is the position of the ANA which is the organization that represents the interests of all registered nurses: \"Nurses have a responsibility first and foremost to their patients. As a nurse, you must always ensure that anything you post or publish could never undermine your patient's treatment or privacy.\" (ANA, 2019, 22 https://www.nursingworld.org/social/). The NCSBN (National Council of State Boards of Nursing) also speaks specifically to the use of social media for nurses. For more information, view the guide available on their website. SON students are responsible and accountable for any and all content (in any format whatsoever) posted, transmitted, or communicated on, by or through any social media account associated with a SON student. The use of social media sites is not approved for classroom communication. The SON utilizes learning management system for course information and communication as well as TAMU email. Any information shared on social media sites in conjunction with the course regarding clinical sites, patient information, pictures, or sharing of course content such as exam questions, may lead to disciplinary action. These actions may range from an unsafe/unprofessional write up to permanent dismissal from the program, depending on the level and severity of the violation. All course material developed by faculty is the prope rty of the SON and the individual faculty member. This property cannot be used without prior consent from the faculty (http://student -rules.tamu.edu/rule22 ). SON students should strictly follow guidelines as noted below: Do not share, post, or otherwise disseminate any information, that can identify a patient, or in any way violate a patient's rights or privacy. This includes activities in the CLRC/simulati on setting. Limiting access through privacy setting is not sufficient to ensure privacy of patients. Never post photographs or any information gained in a nurse -patient relationship. Maintain professional boundaries in the use of electronic media. Online contact with patients blurs these boundaries. Do not post inflammatory or unflattering information about peers, patients, clinical sites and/or their employees on any social media site. Make every effort to present yourself as mature, responsible, and pr ofessional. Promptly report any breach of confidentiality or privacy to your faculty member. Do not share any protected health information. (HIPAA) At all times, behave in a manner consistent with the standards set forth in the Nursing Code of Ethics. Uph old ethical/legal obligations and guidelines regarding patient privacy and confidentiality. Student Complaints The SON is committed to providing a learning environment for its students in which complaints are responded to in a prompt and fair manner. The SON recognizes that disputes may sometimes arise and requires the parties involved to resolve the conflict informally whenever possible. If resolution cannot be reached a formal complaint process is available with the Dean who will make the final d ecision regarding the incident. This 23 process may not be invoked for matters that have independent appeal processes as outlined in the Texas A&M Student Rules or matters which are not grievable to include federal and state laws. For concerns regarding a class, students are expected to follow the appropriate chain of command : 1. Course instructor 2. Program Coordinator 3. Assistant Dean for Distant Site Round Rock (ADRR) (2nd Degree students only) 4. Associate Dean for Undergraduate Nursing Education (ADUNE) 5. Executive Associate D ean (EAD) 6. Dean Grade disputes are addressed in Student Rule 48 . For genera l concerns, students should contact their academic advisor who will direct the student appropriately. Student rule violations outside of the academic classroom environment are reported through Student Co nflict Resolution Services . To report a behavioral concern on the part of a member of the student body, faculty, or staff, refer to the Tell Somebody Reporting process. To report instances of suspected waste, fraud, or a suspected ethics violation, use the Texas A&M University Systems Risk, Fraud, and Misconduct Hotline . Current, former, and prospective students may email Student Complaints or mail a completed THEC B student complaint form to THECB's Office of General Counsel . A non - exhaustive list of exceptions to the types of complaints handled by THECB is provided in the student complaint rules. Temporary Disabilities/ Pregnancy Temporary Disabilities The SON partners with the Department of Disability Resources to provide appropriate accommodation and support. Students should work through Disability Resources for temporary or permanent sensory, physical or psychological disabilities in order to obtain reasonable accommodations. Students who encounter an injury or any other physical limitation of a temporary nature must notify the clinical instructor and course coordinator. In addition, students must provide 24 documentation from a health care provider that the student is able to s afely carry out the duties of a student in the clinical setting. Any restrictions or limitations must be clearly outlined. Documentation must be provided prior to attending clinical experiences.

These exams (also known as Health Education Systems Incorporated or HESI exams) are offered through Evolve Reach and ma y be used confidently to assess students' progress as well as their preparedness for the licensure exam. The tests reflect questions on the actual NCLEX exams, and all items have evidence - based reliability and validity to ensure accurate measurement of test scores and predicti on of NCLEX examination success. Immediate diagnostic reports are provided to identify areas that require further study. Remediation content is custo mized based on the individual student areas of weakness. HESI exit exams evaluate student readiness for the NCLEX exam, with an average predictive 30 accuracy of 97.4%. Chapter 3: Admissions Procedures Applicants are encouraged to review the SON website for specific admission procedures and requirements depending on the track to which you are applying. Deadlines will vary. Students applying to any of the three BSN tracks must provide the following as a minimum: A com pleted application, payment of any associated fee, submission of official college transcripts and timed verbal responses and written assessments. Depending on the track, students may be required to submit both a NursingCAS and an Apply Texas application. Completion of prerequisite courses by the time of enrollment with a grade of \"C\" or better; Prerequisite courses may be in progress during the application period. Students will be required to list courses in progress on the app lication. Acceptance offers will be contingent on successful completion of prerequisite coursework prior to the first class day. Admissions Assessment (HESI A2) entrance exam (not required for RN to BSN applicants) . More information on registering for the exam and submitting scores to the SON is available on the website. Admitted students must have a clear background check and negative drug screen report or the admission offer will be rescinded. All applicants will undergo an extensive background check and complete a drug screen through the CastleBranch compliance proce ss upon admission. TBON requires all unlicensed applicants to have their eligibility for licensure determined before entering a nursing degree program. Applicants will undergo fingerprinting whereby the TBON will then provide an outcome of eligibility for licensure prior to enrollment. RN to BSN students must present a current, active RN license to practice in the state of Texas with no stipul ations. RN to BSN applicants who earned an Associates Degree through an LVN to RN or EMT to RN program should speak with an academic advisor before submitting an application to assure a minimum number of transferable credit hours. Additional Requirements f or International Applicants In addition to each program's stated application requirements, applicants with foreign transcripts must also include a transcript evaluation from an evaluation service which is a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services . We require a course - 31 by-course evaluation for college/university transcripts from non -U.S. institutions. The report should r eflect course by course U.S. grade point equivalencies and semester credits received. These reports must be sent directly from the evaluation agency in the original sealed envelope to NursingCAS. Send to: NursingCAS, P.O. Box 9201, Watertown, MA 02471. If being sent via UPS or FEDEX, send to NursingCAS Transcript Department, 311 Arsenal Street, Suite #15, Watertown, MA 02472. If admitted to the SON , applicants with foreign transcripts must submit the native language transcript along with an official English translation. These documents must include all original seals and/or signatures and be approved by the Texas A&M Office of Admissions prior to enrollment in the program. Applicants whose native language is not English are required to submit proof of English proficiency to be eligible for review. English proficiency can be demonstrated through various criteria. See more on this requirement on the International Admissions website. International applicants will be expected to present declaration of finances, F -1 travel documents and additional documentation upon acceptance to the SON . All d eadlines required by the Office of International Student Services must be met . Admissions Criteria Students applying to the SON must complete selected coursework as a condition of acceptance. If the student completed a core curriculum from another Texas public institution in a previous degree program, they are not required to complete the Texas A&M Core Curriculum. Students, howeve r, must meet the program prerequisite course requirements . Students transferring from out of state, from a private institution, those with an international degree or anyone with concerns about this requirement, please contact an academic advisor for more clarification. Students will not be considered for admission unless all required coursework will be completed by the time of enrollment. Admission to all programs is competitive. Notification of Admission Decisions Official notification is provided vi a the Texas A&M Applicant Information Portal (AIS) portal or through the Nursing CAS application portal. All applicants will receive a communication as to their status; whether admitted, denied, incomplete, or given the option of placement on a waiting lis t. A select number of applicants who are not admitted in the initial round may be offered the opportunity to be placed on a waiting list. If space becomes available, additional offers may be extended. It is the policy of the SON that information regarding placement on the waiting list will only be provided by appointment. 32 Campus Transfer Requests Pre-licensure (Trad BSN and SD -BSN) are admitted to a specific campus location and must attend all classes, exams, simulations labs, an d clinical experiences at that location throughout the duration of the program. Due to strict regulations from TBON which govern clinical rotations, the SON does not allow students to transfer from one campus to another. Transfer Course Credit Policies A student may submit undergraduate course credits earned at other universities for application toward the Texas A&M University School of Nursing BSN degree. Transfer credit will be determined by the SON Office of Student Affairs on a course -by-course basis. Course content will be determined by catalog course description or course syllabus. Credit submitted for transfer must be on an official transcript received from the registrar of the institution where the credit was earned. The transfer of credit decision will be based on the following criteria: Courses given by regionally accredited institutions are considered for transfer if: a. They are acceptable as credit for a bachelor's degree at a regionally accredited institution b. Course content is at or above the level of courses specified in the SON requirements for admission. Courses intended for use in a vocational, technical or occupational program do not transfer. Credit on the transcript must appear in semester hours or credits that may be converted to semester hours. Credit by examination courses may be transferred if accepted by another college and followed by sequenced coursework. Equivalency of coursework is determined by content found in catalog course descriptions or syllabi of courses. Two or more courses may be combined to form one or more equivalent courses. Credit will not be given for courses which were completed at non -accredited institutions. In any case where a decision cannot be made using the above criteria, the Office of Student Affairs will determine the transfer of credit based on university policy, previous actions of the university, and prior experience. This policy is reviewed every two years. Residence Requirement for Baccalaureate Degree A minimum of 36 semester hours of 300 and 400 level course work must be successfully completed in residence at the SON to qualify for a baccalaureate degree in the pre - 33 licensure degrees. The RN-BSN program meets the requirement by completion of 30 semester hours. Transfer from Another Nursing Program A student who has been enrolled in another Nursing program may request admission as a new or transfer applicant. Criteria use d in the decision will be based on the following criteria: Applicants must have a minimum 3.0 GPA (on a 4.0 scale) on all nursing coursework completed. Admission will be dependent on space available. Spaces in clinical courses are tightly controlled by bot h accreditation and clinical agency policies. Courses accepted for transfer must be similar in content and credit to the SON course. Applicants must present a course description and course syllabus for review to the Office of Student Affairs before cre dit will be granted. No grade below a \"C\" in any nursing course will be accepted for transfer. Applicants must submit a letter from the Dean of the previous program stating they would be eligible to return to the previous nursing program as a student in go od standing. Applicants must meet the residence hour requirement for the bachelor's degree. Students will need to complete an assessment prior to beginning classes to determine clinical skills/experience, knowledge base, use of equipment, software and tech nology, etc. If deficiencies are noted, student may be required to complete an independent study course to assist them in successfully transitioning into the new program. Students must demonstrate competence in both nursing content and clinical proficienci es in courses completed more than six (6) months prior to the time of application through an examination and/or clinical demonstration. Other documentation subject to the discretion of the ADAA. Texas Success Initiative The Texas Success Initiative (TSI) was instituted to ensure that students enrolled in Texas public colleges and universities possess the necessary academic skills to perform effectively in college. The Texas Success Initiative Is required by th e Texas State Legislature for identifying and preparing academically those students whose basic skills in reading, writing and/or mathematics are less than what is required to succeed college level courses. 34 Requires continuous student participation in de velopmental education classes if that student is deficient in the academic areas of reading, writing, and/or mathematics. Requires all non-exempt (TSI Exemptions ) incoming students to complete the mandatory TSI Pre -Assessment Activity (PAA) and then to take the TSI Assessment test before registering for classes. Chapter 4: New Student Compliance Computer Requirements A laptop computer is required of all pre -licensure (Traditional or Second Degree BSN) students. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that their computer has the required software installed upon admission and updated throughout their time as a student in order to access course information through the learning management system and other required systems/websites. At all times, the student's comput er should be capable of running the programs. Upon admission, students will be provided with detailed specifications for either a Mac or a Windows laptop. Students will be granted access to an online orientation course with specific instructions and assign ments in the Learning Management System to ensure their computers meet all technical requirements. Completion of the orientation course is required prior to being given access to the learning management system courses. If you have questions regarding any o f the hardware or software required, please contact the Helpdesk at 1 -979-845-8300 and identify yourself as a nursing student. NOTE: RN to BSN students are not required to have a laptop computer, but must have the required software on a computer as require d by the designated program. Health History & Physical Exam Requirement A health examination is required for pre -licensure BSN students entering the SON . Students must present the SON Certificate of Health to their health care provider who must sign and date the document indicating that the student is medically cleared and able to meet the demands and expectations of nursing school. This form must be uploaded in the CastleBranch portal. Insurance Health All nursing students are required to carry and maintain health insurance. Students who presume that they are still covered on their parents' policies are advised to confirm this 35 with their insurance carriers. Some policies delete cove rage for family members who: reach a certain age, get married, no longer reside with parents, etc. Knowing these conditions in advance will permit time to obtain coverage if needed. Under optimal conditions for a healthy individual this could take a month or more. Any enrolled Texas A&M University System student taking at least six (6) credit hours of classes is eligible to enroll in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Academic HealthPlans . Student s are encouraged to compare various plans before purchasing a plan. Students must submit proof of insurance coverage by the end of the first month of enrollment. The following benefits are strongly recommended to provide minimum coverage: in -patient hospit al, medical/surgical, and physical medicine expenses as well as preventive and emergency care. Students are strongly encouraged to consider health and mental health insurance coverage in excess of the required minimum for several reasons, not the least of which is that you may become ill or injured and have bills that could present an unexpected burden. Should students require medical treatment due to situations that may arise while in clinical rotations, i.e. needle stick or other incidences, neither the h ospitals, clinical agencies or SON are responsible to cover any treatment that might be needed. Any medical charges incurred are the responsibility of the student. International Student Insurance Requirements As an enrollment requirement with TAMU , students who are not citizens or permanent residents of the United States will be required to have insurance to include medical evacuation and repatriation. Professional Liability All nursing majors in clinical settings must be covered by malpractice insurance. The cost for liability insurance will be the responsibility of the student (approximate cost each year is $20) and will be included in the student's tuition and fee statem ent. The student policy covers only the work done as students during clinical courses and expires on the date of graduation. The policy does not cover students while employed in clinical agencies. Students employed in a health care setting must obtain a se parate policy for liability coverage if required by that institution. Immunizations Policy As an academic health science center dedicated to educating health care professionals and biomedical researchers, the university has a r esponsibility to support the health of its students, faculty, and staff, as well as the people in the community with whom they come 36 in contact. Toward this end, the SON follows immunization guidelines for students, faculty, and staff based on probability of exposure. These guidelines are consistent with the immunization requirements of Texas Administrative Code, Title 25, Health Services, Part 1, Chapter 97, Subchapter B1 and recommendations for adult immunizations from the Centers for Disease Control. Prior to registration for the first academic semester, students must give evidence of the following immunizations: VACCINE REQUIREMENTS Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis one dose of vaccine , after age 18 and within the past 10 years (valid through projected graduation date Td, Tdap, DPT) Measles (Rubeola) two doses (at least 4 weeks apart) if born after 1957 or positive titer Mumps one dose or positive titer Rubella (German Measles) one dose or positive ti ter Influenza required for all students (must receive the seasonal vaccine each year) Bacterial Meningitis (MCV4,MPSV4) one dose within the 5 year period immediately preceding first class day; exceptions based on age > 22 Varicella (chickenpox) one dose for students who received this vaccine prior to 13 years of age; OR two doses for students who were not vaccinated before their 13th birthday; OR proof of exposure OR a positive titer within last 5 years Hepatitis B* positive antibody titer within last 5 years Tuberculosis (TB) skin test or approved blood assay Skin or blood assay test required annually *The Hepatitis B series must be initiated prior to enrollment in order to have all doses completed shortly after entry into clinical experiences. For Hepatitis B, a surface antibody serologic marker (blood titer) is required 6 weeks after receiving the last dose to ensure immunity or the series will have to be repea ted. If vaccinations received in prior years, blood titer within last 5 years is required to ensure immunity. 37 Students with immune -compromised conditions or chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus are encouraged to consider obtaining pneumococcal vaccinations. All costs associated with obtaining immunizations are the sole responsibilit y of the student. Female students are advised that pregnancy is a contraindication to administration of certain vaccinations and should consult their healthcare provider for specific and additional information regarding vaccine administration. The SON uses CastleBranch as the manager of compliance requirements. Students must complete all items requested through their portal. The SON may be asked to provide proof of immunizations to authorized parties as a pre -requisite to participation in advanced clinical experiences at a particular site. In that event, students are requested to sign release of student information request forms and are bound by their stipulations. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Certification Each student must obtain certification in Basic Life Support through the American Heart Association by the designated deadline prior to the first class day. This certification must be maintained throughout enrollment. If your initial training will expire during the course of your enrollment, you will be required to certification renewal to CastleBranch portal . This applies to all students, including those in the RN to BSN track. Students who have not submitted appropriate documentation by the designated deadline or upon request will be dropped from all classes immediately. Criminal Background Checks Policy Because health care providers are entrusted with the health, safety and welfare of patients, have access to controlled substances and confidential information, and operate in settings that require the exercise of good judgment and ethical behavior, crimina l background checks are required. All nursing students must submit to and satisfactorily complete a criminal background review as a condition of admission. This requires that applicants be fingerprinted through a select agency. TBON has initiated a proces s for nursing school applicants to complete a background check. Upon being fingerprinted, applicants will undergo both a Department of Public Safety and a Federal Bureau of Investigation check which will meet the requirements by the Board when the student prepares to apply for licensure in their final semester of nursing school. The applicant is responsible for the cost. Regardless of what background checks you may have had in the past, you are still required to submit to this particular check. 38 A declaratory order is required by TBON if there is any history related to criminal activity, alcohol/substance abuse or mental illness. More information may be o btained on the TBON website. Procedure for Background Check The Office of Student Affairs sends a roster of applicants to TBON. Applicants are then sent an email from the vendor, IdentoGO, to schedule fingerprinting. The fingerprinting company electronically submits the fingerprint scan to Department of Public Saf ety to initiate the background check and transmits results directly to TBON. When received, TBON will do one of the following: o Mail a blue postcard directly to those students who have a clear check; or o Correspond with students who have a rejected fingerpri nt scan and request another scan; or o Correspond with students who have a positive background check and request they submit a petition for declaratory order (DO); or o Correspond with students that the Operations Team at TBON cannot approve their DO petition, they must pay a review fee and their file will be transferred to the TBON Enforcement Team. Students must obtain TBON clearance prior to enrollment in their first semester. Students must upload either the blue postcard or their letter of clearance from a DO process in the CastleBranch compliance portal. Students may be required by TBON to repeat a background check if any offenses occur while in the program. All students are expected to obey federal, state, and local laws. Criminal activity that occurs while a student is enrolled in the program must be self -disclosed to the ADSA within 72 hours of the offense. Depending on the circumstances of the charge, student access to clinical experiences may be impacted. Failure to disclose information may result in dismissal from the program. Background check results will be kept in the student's confidential file by the ADSA . This information may only be accessed by the ADSA, ADAA, and the Dean. A student who has a break in their enrollment is required to complete a new background check. A break in enrollment is defined as non -enrollment of at least one semester. All students must also have a background check completed through CastleBranch which provides a comprehensive check beyond the TBON process. The student is r esponsible for the cost of this screening. An offer of admission will not be final until the completion of the 39 background check with results that are deemed favorable. Admission may be denied or rescinded based on the review. Students who refuse to submi t to a background check may be dismissed from the program. Other Requirements Each student receives a \"New Student Guide\" that provides additional compliance requirements to include urine drug screening, clinical training modules, etc. It is the student's responsibility to review the guide carefully and meet all compliance by the deadline noted in the CastleBranch portal. Failure to maintain full compliance will result in both: 1) blocked access to the Learning Management System, and 2) exclusion fr om all clinical experiences until the situation has been resolved. Chapter 5: Registrar Policies & Procedures Howdy is a web portal that provides applicants, students, faculty, and staff convenient access to Texas A&M University web services. Howdy is available by going to https://howdy.tamu.edu/ and logging in using the assigned NetID. Howdy allows students to view and update TAMU information, access TAMU Email, and a variety of other web links. Access includes, but is not limited to, the following resources. My Record tab includes the following channels: Graduation Registration Registration Time Assignment Search Class Schedule Add or Drop Classes Registration Status (includes View Holds; Registration History) View My Schedule Final Exam Schedules Change Class/KINE options Grades and Transcripts Grades Credit by Examination Official Transcript (Order Official Transcript) View Unoff icial Transcript View Holds 40 My Information Withhold Directory Information View/Update Contact Information (includes Addresses/Phones; Emergency) Degree Evaluation Application for Graduation View Degree Evaluation Excess Credit Hours Rule Academic Resources My Finances tab includes the following channels: Billing - Tuition & Fees Pay My Tuition/Manage My Account Refunds Scholarships and Financial Aid Student Life tab includes the following channels: Parking and Transportation Student Involvement Purchase Optional Services Employment and Internships Excess Credit Hour Policy The state of Texas will not provide funds to state institutions of higher education for excess semester credit hours earned by a resident student. Since funding will not be provided by the state, and as permitted by state law, TAMU will charge tuition at the no n-resident rate to all students that exceed the semester credit hour limit of their program. Effective with students initially enrolling in the fall 1999 semester and subsequent terms, excess credit hours are those hours attempted by a resident undergradua te student that exceed by more than 45 hours the number of hours required for completion of the degree plan in which the student is enrolled. Effective with students initially enrolling in the fall 2006 semester and subsequent terms, excess credit hours ar e those hours attempted by a resident undergraduate student that exceed by more than 30 hours the number of hours required for completion of the degree program in which the student is enrolled. The limitation on excess credit hours applies only to those un dergraduate students who first enter higher education in the fall of 1999 and thereafter. For purposes of excess hours, resident undergraduate student includes a nonresident student who is permitted to pay resident tuition. Exceptions to the rule may be ac cessed on the registrar Excess Credit Hour 41 webpage. For questions or concerns, you may email: excesscredithours@tamu.edu or call (979) 845 -1085. Leave of Absence (LOA) Students wishing to take a leave of absence should speak to their academic a dvisor, view information on the TAMU website and contact the Financial Aid Office. Pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery are justification for a LOA for so long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to the status which she held when the leave began (Title IX Education Amendments, Section 106.40(b)(5)). Prompt and appropriate communi cation by the student is necessary to ensure appropriate accommodations are provided. While retroactive requests will be considered, making arrangements in advance is preferred, and requests that are untimely may be denied on that basis. Military Leave Withdrawal due to a call -up to active military duty is not processed through the online withdrawal system. A special procedure has been established for students who must withdraw from TAMU for this reason . Q-Drops Undergraduate students will normally be permitted four Q -drops during their undergraduate studies; however: State law prohibits students from having more than six dropped courses from all state institutions attended during their undergraduate career if they entered higher education as a first -time enrolled freshman beginning the 2007 fall semester or after. Q-drops in one -hour courses will not count in the Texas A&M limit of four but will be included in the State -mandated limit of six dropped courses. If a lecture and companion lab are dropped at the same time, this will count as one Q -drop rather than two. (Texas A&M University Student Rule 1.16.4 ) The Univers ity allows a student to drop a course without academic penalty through the 60th class day of a fall or spring semester, the 15th class day of summer term or the 35th class day of a 10 -week summer semester. The symbol Q shall be placed on the academic recor d to indicate a drop without academic penalty. Courses Q -dropped must have approval of the student's Dean or designee or department as determined by the respective college. Nursing students in jeopardy of failing a course should speak to their instructor, their academic advisor and be aware of all program progression rules. 42 Readmission Any student admitted to the SON who withdraws will be required to reapply. Contact your academic advisor for more information. The Undergraduate Admissions , Progression , and Graduation Committee reviews all requests for readmission to the SON .

Academic Success Program Transforming individuals into nurses requires acquisition of scientific knowledge, critical reasoning, skill devel opment, and values to shape professionals characterized by caring, empathy, social justice and ethical comportment. SON faculty understand the challenges of the transition and are committed to success of all students in our community. To achieve that goal, the SON offers two evidence -based resources , the Academic Success Coach and 49 Supplemental Instruction (SI), to facil itate student success and successful progression toward degree completion for nursing students at all levels. Students may individually select to access the support of either the Academic Coach or SI. In addition, faculty may also refer students to one or both resources. Information is available on the TAMU Academic Success website . Academic Success Coach The Academic Success Coach provides individualized guidance in skill development and identifying interventions to assist students to successfully to navigate the nursing program. The Academic Success Coach meets with students seeking this service and asses ses student need. Students and their coach co -design an action plan with specific steps and monitor individual student progress. Intervention strategies address a number of areas including study skills, test -taking skills, and time management skills. A co ach is available on both the Bryan and Round Rock campuses. Supplemental Instruction In addition, SI is offered in the first semester of the pre -license program. SI is a peer - led, academic assistance program that can significantly improve performance for students who attend regularly. In the SON SI leaders are students who have been successful in pharmacology and in pathophysiology. Weekly tutoring sessions free to any student wishing to participate. SI is sponsored by the Association of Former Students. Both TAMU and the SON invest in this program because evidence indicates that students who attend 10 or more sessions throughout the semester earn half to a full letter grade higher than those students who do not attend. University Writing Center The University Writing Center , a unit of Undergraduate Studies, supports writing and public speaking for every Texas A&M student, with particular emphasis on supporting Writing and Communication courses. Their priorities are as follows: To help gra duate and undergraduate students practice the habits of mature composers of written and oral communication. 50 To provide resources for faculty and Graduate Assistant Teachers for integrating best writing and oral communication pedagogy into courses. Chapter 7: Academic Rules, Policies, and Procedures \"An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do.\" TAMU is dedicated to the discovery, development, communication and application of knowledge in a wide range o f academic and professional fields and assumes as its historic trust the maintenance of freedom of inquiry and an intellectual environment nurturing the human mind and spirit. Living in accordance with the Aggie Code of Honor is critical to these ideals, to the goal of assuming a place of preeminence in higher education, and to the development of the whole student. The Aggie Honor System Office (AHSO) administers the TAMU Honor System. As such, it is the central office responsible for maintaining records and coordinating communication, prevention, training, remediation, and adjudication efforts for the TAMU Honor System. Additionally, it provide s assistance to members of t he university community when questions or concerns arise pertaining to academic misconduct. It oversees the operations and functioning of the Honor Council, a body of students and faculty established to hear and adjudicate honor cases. Instructors as well as students may report a violation to the AHSO. Student Rules Each student has the responsibility to be fully acquainted with and to comply with the Texas A&M University Student Rules . The Texas A&M University Student Rules are broken down into three sections, with additional information provided in the appendixes: Part I: Academic Rules (Rules 1 - 22 & 61) Part II: Student Life Rules (Rules 23 - 44) Part III: Student Grievance Procedures (Rules 45 - 60) Appendi ces The Texas A&M Office of the Dean of Student Life has primary jurisdiction over reports of behaviors that implicate rules contained in the Student Code of Conduct. For rules and regulations governing the Student Conduct Co de, see Student Rule 24 . The SON has 51 primary jurisdiction over reports of behaviors that implicate the Professional Standards of the academic program. Academic Integrity Academic integrity is an essential force in the academic life of a university. It enhances the quality of education and celebrates the genuine achievements of others. It is, without reservation, a responsibility of all members of the TAMU community to acti vely promote academic integrity. Apathy or acquiescence in the presence of academic dishonesty is not a neutral act -- failure to confront and deter it will reinforce, perpetuate, and enlarge the scope of such misconduct. As such, a primary responsibility assumed by TAMU students is to promote the ideals of the Aggie Code of Honor. Various methods of encouraging integrity exist, such as setting an example for new students, education through student organizations, and student -to-student moral suasion. Studen ts have the responsibility to confront their peers engaging in compromising situations, and if unsuccessful, to report the matter to the Aggie Honor System Office. Self -reporting is encouraged and may be considered a mitigating circumstance in the sanction ing phase of a particular case. Instructors are expected to take proactive steps to promote academic integrity. Instructors should have an open discussion about academic integrity with students in their courses early in the semester. Instructors and staff share in the responsibility and authority to challenge and make known acts that violate the Aggie Code of Honor. Additionally, instructors are expected to adhere to the policy pertaining to the reporting and adjudication of violations of the Aggie Code of Honor. Initiating formal procedures is a necessary and obligatory component of this shared responsibility. Collaboration and sharing information are characteristics of academic communities. These become violations when they involve dishonesty or are used i n ways that give a student an unfair advantage. Instructors shall make clear to students their expectations about collaboration and information sharing. Students should seek clarification when in doubt. While Texas A&M values and affirms all cultures, it i s important to recognize that only one standard of academic integrity will be tolerated; this is the Aggie Code of Honor. If the alleged misconduct meets the definition of \"misconduct in research or scholarship\" under System Regulation 15.99.03 - Ethics in Research and Scholarship and relates to federally funded research, either by an active federal research project or the use of data that was compiled in whole or in p art with federal funds the procedures set out 15.99.03 and University Rule 15.99.03.M1 - Responsible Conduct in Research and Scholarship will apply. Violations of academic rules are likely to violate the Code of Conduct for Nurses as well. It is not uncommon for violations of an academic nature to also be reviewed for possible 52 disciplinary sanctions. For student guidance related to any academic rules o r polices, please contact your academic advisor. Definitions of Academic Misconduct Definitions of academic misconduct may be found in Student Rule 20.1.2.3. They include cheating, fabrication, falsification, multiple submissions, plagiarism, complicity, abuse and misuse of access, violation of college rules, and university rules on research. Clarification on each of these areas is provided under Student Rule 20. The listing is not, however, exclusive of any other act that may reasonably be called academi c dishonesty. Students should also be familiar with Student Rule 52 and Student Rule 53. All student rules may be found at the Student Rules website. TAMU students are respons ible for authenticating all work submitted to an instructor. If asked, students must be able to produce proof that the item submitted is indeed the work of that student. Students must keep appropriate records at all times. The inability to authenticate one 's work, should the instructor request it, is sufficient grounds to initiate an academic dishonesty case. Other Types of Conduct Concerns Student rule violations outside of the academic classroom environment are reported through Student Conflict Resolution Services . To report a behavioral concern on the part of a member of the student body, faculty, or staff, refer to the Tell Somebody Reporting process . To report instances o f suspected waste, fraud, or a suspected ethics violation, use the Texas A&M University Systems Risk, Fraud, and Misconduct Hotline . Grading Policy A four -point (4.0) grading system is utilized in the SON . The grading scale is as follows: A - Excellent Four grade points per credit hour 90 - 100 B - Good Three grade points per credit hour 80 - 89 C - Fair Two grade points per credit hour 70 - 79 *D - Poor One grade point per credit hour 60 - 69 53 *F - Failure No grade points Below 60 I - Incomplete No grade points NG - No Grade Grade removed from record, no grade points, hours not included in GPR \u00b1Q Course dropped with no penalty, no grade points, hours not included in GP R S - Satisfactory (C or above) No grade points, hours not included in GPR U - Unsatisfactory (D or F) No grade points, hours included in GPR X - No grade submitted No grade poi nts, hours not included in GPR W - Withdraw No grade points, hours not included in GPR *Minimum academic requirements for retention in the program are a grade of \"C\" in all nursing courses. A grade of \"D\" or \"F\" are failing grades in the SON . Grade Rounding Policy All graded assignments and exams will be calculated to the hundredth (i.e. two decimal points). No grades will be rounded including final exam averages and final course grades. For courses in which it is required to achieve an exam average of 70% or better in order to pass the course, students must have an average exam score of greater or equal to 70% on unit exams and comprehensive final exam (if given) to pass the course. The average of 70% on exams must be achieved BEFORE the remaining content percentages are factored into the final course grade. If an exam aver age of 70% is not achieved, the final grade earned for the course will reflect the average of exam scores. Example: Exam Grades: 1 56 2 64 54 3 72 Final 76 Exam Average: 67 Final Grade = D Progression Good Academic Standing Good academic standing is defined as having a minimum grade point average of a 2.0 (on a 4.0 scale), maintaining a minimum grade of \"C\" in all courses, and non -probationary status. Students must be in good academic standing in order to progress in the prog ram. All Nursing students have the obligation to make satisfactory progress toward completion of all degree requirements. A minimum standard to measure degree progress requires satisfactory completion of 75 percent of attempted course credit hours each ac ademic year. Academic Progression Criteria Rules for program progression are as follows: Students must meet all co -requisites or prerequisites to progress in the program. Some nursing courses are sequential and may not be taken out of sequence. Progression into the next semester's nursing courses are contingent upon the successful completion (grade of C or better) of all previous semester courses. Grades of D, F, or U are n ot acceptable in nursing courses. Students who receive a grade of D, F or U in any course in any given semester will be automatically placed on probation and notified in writing of probation status. The student will remain on probation until the course is repeated with a C or better. The course can only be taken through the Texas A&M SON unless approved by the ADAA . A second attempt in a course cannot be \"Q\" dropped. The grade earned in a second attempt will stand. Students who earn a grade of D or F upon repetition of a nursing course or have two nursing course failures are ineligible to continue enrollment in the SON . Students who are unsuccessful in meeting clinical objectives of a clinical course will receive a final grade of \"F\", regardless of what the current grade is for the didactic portion of the course. Spaces in clinical courses are tightly controlled by both accreditation and clinical agency policies, so permission to retake/repeat a course will be granted on a space - available basis. A st udent who is out of sequence in the curriculum (whether due to 55 illness, course failure, or other reasons) cannot be assured of a space in subsequent courses, though every effort will be made to accommodate him/her. If a student repeats a course which he/s he has failed in the SON , the official grade for the final graduation degree audit is the last one earned. See Student Rule 10 regarding calculation of the cumulative GP R. If there will be a sequential break of time spent in the clinical setting of one semester or more, then the student may be required to enroll and successfully complete a zero -credit hour course before progres sing in the curriculum. Students must complete the program to which they enrolled in three (3) consecutive years or six (6) long semesters. Exceptions for extenuating circumstances (i.e. serious illness, pregnancy, etc.) will be considered. In addition to obtaining grades of C or above in all nursing courses, students must demonstrate their ability to deliver safe care to patients at all times. Failure to provide safe patient care may result in immediate withdrawal from the course and, potentially, dismiss al from the SON . Academic Success Plan for Nursing Students Students who are not successful in meeting the requirements for testing within a course are responsible to develop their own success plan using all available resources. For more information s ee the Academic Success Plan for Nursing Students (Appendix A). Q Drop Policy Q drops for students who fail the practicum objectives of a course for safety, competence, or professionalism are not allowed. The student will receive a grade \"F\" regardless of what the current grade is for the didactic portion of the course. In addition, students must withdraw and/or may not enroll in any other clinical courses until the situation has been resolved or the student has been successfully remediated. Students who are not meeting the objectives for the clinical portion of a clinical course for reasons other than the three concerns noted above may opt to 'Q' drop (a drop without academic penalty) before the designated deadline. In addition, students must withdraw and/or may not enroll in any other clinical courses until the situation has been re solved or the student has been successfully remediated. Student may continue attending the didactic portion of class, however, they will not be allowed to take exams, submit assignments, earn credit or a grade for the course. Incomplete Grade Policy An incomplete grade (I) may be assigned when there is unfinished work and the student is in good academic standing (at least a C grade) in the course. A student who requests an incomplete must initiate contact with the faculty member. This discussion will be converted 56 to a written Incomplete Contract and signed before the last class meeting of the semester in which the I will be re corded. The instructor shall give this grade only when the deficiency is due to an authorized absence or other cause beyond the control of the student. When an instructor reports an incomplete grade to the registrar, he or she will fill out an \"Incomplete Grade Re port,\" which is filed with the ADSA . Copies should be provided to the student and to the student's academic dean(s). This report includes (1) a statement of the instructor's reason for awarding the incomplete grade and (2) a statement concerning the remain ing work to be completed before the last day of scheduled classes of the next fall or spring semester in which the student enrolls in the university unless the student's academic Dean or designee, with the consent of the instructor grants an extension of t ime for good reason. The student and the faculty member should discuss a plan, including a schedule, for completing the remaining work prior to the conferral of an I. All requirements of the contract must be satisfied in order for the student to progress i n the program. A grade of incomplete will be marked on the grade roster at the end of the term. It is the responsibility of the instructor to initiate and complete a Change of Grade form. An I must be completed before the end of the subsequent semester in which the I was given. The grade of I will automatically become an F if not removed within the prescribed time limit; however, an extension may be requested by the instructor when the Request for an Incomplete Grade form is submitted with the submission o f grades, provided that a definitive time frame for completion is presented. An extension will be granted only for circumstances beyond the control of the student. Grade Disputes & Undergraduate Appeals Process The instructor of the class is the primary au thority with respect to a student's proficiency and final grade in the course as noted in Student Rule 48. Grade Disputes . A student who believes that his or her final grade reflects a capricious, arbitrary or prejudiced academic evaluation must follow the resolution procedures and deadlines as described in Student Rule 57 Undergraduate Academic Appeals Panel . Academic Dismissal Students will not be permitted to continue in the nursing program or apply for readmission if they: 1 ) receive a grade of D or F in more than one course, 2) receive any combination of grades of D or F on two attempts of the same course, or 3) receive written email notice of dismissal from the program by the ADAA or ADSA for failure to adhere to SON policy . 57 The basis for an appeal on grades are outlined in Student Rule 57 Graduate Academic Appeals Panel . The basis for an appeal based upon dismissal for failur e to adhere to SON Professional Standards Policy will follow the procedures as noted in the section on Violation of the Professional Code of Ethics found in this handbook . Dismissed students are expected to make arrangements with the Office of Student Affairs to begin the formal withdrawal process in a timely manner. Dismissed students will be required to turn in any equipment or materials belonging to the SON as well as any SON ID badges. Chapter 7: Classro om & Clinical Expectations Civility Statement The Texas A&M SON is committed to creating and maintaining a positive learning environment consistent with the American Nurses Association's Code of Ethics which states nurses are required to \"create an ethical environment and culture of civility and kindness, treating coll eagues, coworkers, employees, students, and others with dignity and respect\" (ANA, 2015, p. 4). To support an environment for positive learning any disregard for the effects of one's actions on others, bullying, harassment, intimidation, manipulation, thre ats, or violence are always morally unacceptable behaviors (p.20). Each course is geared at helping all students learn to think and act like a nurse. Each student toward the end is expected to demonstrate ethical and professional behavior in all aspects o f the course. To assist in a healthy and respectful learning environment, we ask that students follow the protocols below: For online classes: Use proper netiquette. (Netiquette is a combination of words \"network\" and \"etiquette\") Be respectful of each oth er and your instructor. Address each person individually when you create responses. For example, when you respond, be friendly, begin your writing with a greeting, i.e. howdy or hello. Praise and support your fellow Aggies For face to face classes: Be on time to class and attend class regularly. 58 Refrain from unsavory or unprofessional use of language. Silence your cell phone during class; refrain from texting during class. Keep chit -chat to a minimum in class to avoid distraction to others. Treat your colleagues, the agency staff, and the faculty with respect. Demonstrate ethical and professional behavior in all aspects of this course. In addition, TAMU and the SON expect all students to abide by the Aggie Honor Code and conduct thems elves as an Aggie (see Chapter 7). Clinical Expectations NOTE: Clinical settings include: skills lab, simulation encounters with and without standardized patients , virtual simulation, hospitals, clinics, and other patient care settings, as well as general community based encounters . All clinical experiences are selected to offer valuable learning opportunities. Patient Safety Faculty who teac h clinical nursing courses are responsible for guiding students in the development of professional nursing skills and values. Clinical objectives will be clearly defined for students and requirements stated in the course syllabi as well as information on h ow the clinical grade will be determined. Students will provide nursing care to clients under the facilitation of clinical faculty and supervision of an assigned registered nurse. Students are expected to participate in all nursing care activities that th e students has been successful in checking off in the skills lab. Students are held responsible for all nursing skills learned from previous courses. When providing clinical care, nursing students are held to the same standards as the RN (i.e. what would t he reasonably prudent nurse with like education and experience do). Patients should be able to expect safe, quality care. Faculty may request a student be removed from the clinical setting if the level of performance does not meet an acceptable level of c ompetence. Reasons for clinical setting dismissal may include but are not limited to: 1. Lack of preparation for clinical 2. Unsafe practice 3. Unprofessional behavior, conduct, or dress 4. Breach of confidentiality, lack of patient identification prior to care or med ication administration 5. Medication administration without appropriate preparation, supervision, or technique 59 6. Violation of the Texas Nurse practice Act of ANA Code for Nurses 7. Endangerment of patient rights and/or safety. Clinical setting dismissal for any of the reasons noted above may constitute immediate clinical failure for the semester. If a student is removed from one clinical setting due to concerns about professionalism, safety or competence, he/she will not be allo wed to continue in other course clinical rotations until the situation has been resolved. Legal and ethical grounds exist for dismissal of a student who is clinically deficient. Any unsafe or unprofessional act that leads to, or could lead to, injury of a patient may result in immediate removal from the clinical setting. Consequences may range from additional written paperwork up to dismissal from the nursing program. Clinical Course Concerns Students may not be allowed to continue in a clinical course if t he following situations arise: 1) Not meeting clinical objectives in a timely manner. Students who are not meeting the objectives for the clinical portion of a clinical course may opt to Q drop (a drop without academic penalty) before the designated deadli ne. They will be allowed to continue attending the didactic portion of class, however, they will not be allowed to take exams, submit assignments, earn credit or a grade for the course. 2) Not meeting expectations for patient safety, competence or professi onalism as expected for the level of education and experience to which they have attained through the nursing curriculum. Students who fail the clinical portion of a course for safety, competence, or professionalism concerns may not Q drop or withdraw from that clinical course. They will receive a grade of F for the course. They may continue attending the didactic portion of class but will not be allowed to take exams, submit assignments, or earn credit for the course. In addition, students must withdraw an d/or may not enroll in any other clinical courses until the situation has been resolved or the student has been successfully remediated. Practice is determined to be unsafe if, due to student knowledge deficits, lack of effective clinical decision making, failure to appropriately monitor patient's condition and respond appropriately (clinician notification and direct care actions), or inappropriate communication, a patient is harmed or very likely to be at risk for harm. Unsafe practice is also related to t he appropriate level of supervision that can be provided to support student learning and practice. Students in more advanced stages of their undergraduate curriculum are expected to be able to practice safely with decreasing levels of direct faculty 60 and pr eceptor supervision. Other factors contributing to an assessment of unsafe practice include falsified documentation, failure to communicate truthfully and aggressive/non - collaborative interpersonal communications patterns. Errors related to patient care ar e to be reported to clinical faculty and students will complete a report detailing all aspects of the incident. Severity of errors will be analyzed by faculty to determine students' progression in the course. Safety is a critical element on all clinical ev aluation tools. Attendance Students are expected to attend all clinical and/or lab sessions including classes in the Simulation Lab. Failure to appear for scheduled clinical sessions, coming unprepared, and tardiness are viewed as unprof essional behavior. The course syllabus will provide information regarding the attendance policy for each course. Students are expected to be present for change of shift report. First tardy may result in a Professional Improvement Plan (PIP) from your clini cal instructor. Second tardy will result in a PIP from your clinical instructor. The third tardy will result in a PIP in addition to action as determined by the clinical instructor and may lead to an unexcused clinical absence. Clinical paperwork (clinical prep forms, concept maps, etc.) is due at the time designated by the clinical faculty. Failure to have appropriate paperwork to present to the clinical instructor may result in additional assignments, being sent home for the day, rescheduling of clinical time, and/or receiving a PIP. n Violation of confidentiality, including photocopying patient documents, taking photographs, removing documents from the hospital or postings on internet social networking sites will be subject to disciplinary actio n (Refer to HIPAA policy). Loss of the hospital issued ID and room access badges will result in a minimum $25 replacement fee. Use of another student's ID badge is unprofessional behavior and will not be allowed. University ID badges must be worn at al l times in the clinical setting. Any student who forgets their ID badge will be dismissed from clinical until they present with proper identification. Failure to return to clinical will result in a clinical failure for the day. Students are expected to mee t clinical expectations as outlined in the course syllabi specific to each course. Policy for Clinical Concerns Faculty may complete Safety Improvement Plan (SIP) or PIP should students fail to meet expectations in either cours e or clinical settings. These require a meeting with the professor and discussion regarding the incident and the report is submitted to the 61 Assistant Dean for Student Affairs to be filed in the student's record. Note this is not a part of the student's per manent academic record but may be considered should additional disciplinary action be required . Students have the opportunity to add comments, additional facts, etc. in response to the written report. Informative coaching that result s from a PIP/SIP are c umulative . After 3 have occurred (may be from more than one course or semester), the 3rd occurrence will result in a disciplinary meeting with the ADAA . Complete honesty with the clinical instructor is an expectation of every student. Dishonesty shall be defined to include withholding information and/or failing to immediately disclose appropriate information pertaining to the client and/or clinical scenari o to the faculty member and/or the assigned staff nurse. Students who are found to be practicing in a dishonest manner will be asked to leave the clinical setting and may receive a failing grade in the course and dismissal from the nursing program. In the event that a student is dismissed from clinical, no make -up will be provided. A PIP/SIP will be completed for the day. If a student violates any of the standards on the clinical evaluation tool (CET) the faculty will: Complete the PIP/SIP ; If it is an unsafe behavior, contact the ADAA as soon as possible; Make an appointment prior to the next clinical day to meet with the student to counsel them , give them an opportunity to respond, and provide them with an action plan for remediation ; Attach a copy of the CET with all objectives that were not met identified with an Unsatisfactory marking; Submit the PIP/SIP to the ADSA for placement in the student 's unofficial academic file; Provide copies to the student, the coordinator of the course, and the ADUNE . Reporting of Illness & Absence It is the responsibility of a student to promptly inform their clinical instructor in the event of an absence or illness. If students in a clinical course cannot reach their faculty member, the student should call the nurse in charge of the unit to which they are assigned at least one hour (or earlier, if possible) b efore the scheduled assignment. Clinical absences, unless a true emergency or pre -arranged with clinical faculty approval, are not acceptable. In the event of a no call and no show, the absence may result in a conference with clinical faculty, course coor dinator, and the ADAA . 62 Dress Code/Uniforms Rules The SON expects students to reflect professionalism and maintain high standards of appearance and grooming in the clinical setting as well as in the classroom. Clinical faculty will have final judgment on the appropriateness of student attire and corrective action for dress code violations. Traditional/Second Degree B.S.N. Student Dress Code: As students in a professional program, it is important to dress as professionals . We often have unexpected visitors to the SON and wish to represent it well. The following items are not deemed appropriate in the classroom: clothing that shows the mid -drift or low cut tops halter tops or tube tops; spaghetti straps tops mini -skirts or shorts above the mid -thigh see-through clothing clothing with distasteful or crude lettering or messages Uniforms must be standard nursing scrubs with sleeves (style, color, and vendor to be designated by SON). Uniforms may be purchased through the Texas A&M Bookstore . Uniforms from other companies are not allowed. Additional uniforms may be purchased at any time during your enrollment through the Texas A&M Bookstore. Students will have 2 sets of uniforms (maroon scrub tops and maroon scrub pants). It is recommended that you buy sizes that will allow you to freely move about, bend, and reach as this will be required for your work in clinical settings. Students will frequently be in a clinical setting 2 or more days each week so shou ld consider purchasing 2 or more of each item. Lab coats are not allowed in clinical facilities due to the possibility of transferring harmful substances or agents. Students may wear a long sleeve solid white t -shirt under the uniform or the approved optio nal uniform item (snap front jacket) during cooler times of the year or as needed. Make sure to wash the maroon colored garments separately from other colored items as the colors may bleed if not washed appropriately. Students are required to wear their s tudent identification badge with picture during all clinical experiences. The badge must be worn in plain sight. Names on the badges must not be covered up with tape, pins, stickers, etc. The student must wear a name badge and appropriate shoes (leather o r leather -like, closed toe and closed heels). 63 All students are also required to purchase a SON polo shirt (style to be designated by SON ). The SON polo shirt is worn when visiting clients in the community or collecting data on the hospital or agency unit for next -day clinical assignments. Students must wear the polo shirt with black or khaki slacks or skirt unless otherwise instructed by faulty. No shorts or jeans are to be worn when in the hospital or in any clinical agency. Shoes should be closed -toed with flat or low -heels (1 \u00bd inches or less). Tennis shoes or flip flops are not acceptable community attire. Name badges are required at all times when students are in a clinical setting. Students are advised to purchase at least two uniforms and one SON polo shirt. Strict adherence to the dress code is expected. The following rules apply to the clinical setting (unless otherwise instructed by your professors). NOTE: Mental Health Nursing will be more prescriptive in the dress code for these clinical rotations. Shoes Shoes must be impermeable (non -mesh), leather or leather -like, closed toe and closed heels, with a non -skid or non -slip sole. Students must follow clinical agency policy regarding shoes. Jewelry Watches must be plain, simple timepieces with no jewels or stones; a watch with a second hand is necessary; digital watches are acceptable if they allow for counting seconds One plain wedding band (no stones) is the only ring wear allowed but may need to be removed when safety or infection control is a concern Pierced jewelry may only be stud or button style earrings No other pierced jewelry on any other visible part of the body (other than the ear) is allowed No necklaces are allowed Hair Hair is to be clean, neat, and well gr oomed Shoulder length hair or longer must be pulled back behind the ears and secured up completely off the neck in a bun Hair should be kept off the face and in no way obscure vision Hair must be a natural color (i.e., a shade of black, brown, red, gray, or blonde) Nails Nails are to be clean, groomed, manicured and cut to the tip of the finger Artificial nails are prohibited No nail polish may be worn 64 No fingernail jewelry may be worn; no stenciling or glitter is permitted on nails Other Stethosco pe covers are not allowed Ankle socks or stockings must be worn with uniform shoes Personal hygiene including oral care, daily showering/bathing, and the use of deodorant is expected No perfume or scented lotions are to be worn Gum chewing is not permitt ed No tattoos on the face or front of the neck will be permitted, with the exception of permanent makeup that is not extreme in nature. Tattoos deemed as inappropriate, vulgar, or obscene must be covered. Students must follow clinical agency policy rega rding the visibility of tattoos Long -sleeved white t -shirt under the uniform is allowed as needed following clinical unit policy Outer garments are not permitted in patient areas Undergarments should not be visible Headbands should be plain, subtle, modest, unadorned and unembellished Student facial hair should be cleanly shaven and/or beards neatly trimmed Students may not wear a uniform with the SON logo and student name tag while working as an employee of any agency, observing or volunteering in a healthcare capacity. Many agencies have dress codes that exceed SON uniform requirements. Students and faculty will comply with the dress code of the agency in which clinical learning activities are scheduled. Dress code guidelines will be addressed further during clinical orientation. Strict adherence to the dress code is expected. RN-BSN Dress Code: When RN -BSN students' practicum experiences are in acute care facilities, Wear busine ss casual clothes with clean and pressed white lab coats. The lab coat must not have any other identifiers on it. Covering identifiers with tape is not acceptable. Wear the SON name tags at all times in practicum experiences. Wear only close -toed shoes in the acute care setting. While in case management or leadership experiences, students may opt to wear scrubs with a lab coat or street clothes with a lab coat. Lab coats should be plain and not reflect 65 affiliation with another facility/institution/employer. Scrubs must be maroon in color. These requirements apply to NURS 464, 46 5, 466, and 467. In the community, RN -BSN students are expected to wear business casual with the SON name badge. This situation occurs during commun ity settings with family experiences and the community health project. These requirements apply to NURS 464, NURS 4 66 , and 467. Evaluation of Faculty, Courses, and Program Student participation in faculty, course, and program evaluations is both the stud ent's right and responsibility. The process of evaluation is viewed as the student's opportunity for input into curriculum development and the assessment of faculty effectiveness and student learning needs. Students are therefore encouraged to participate in all evaluations which will be done during the course of each semester. Evaluations are anonymous. Guidelines for Classroom Experiences Electronic Devices Electronic devices may only be used for clinically related purposes as approved by supervising clinical faculty. The electronic device may be loaded with required reference - based software and utilized in the cli nical setting to facilitate learning. Students must adhere to the policies of the clinical site, as well as the SON policy regarding the use of electronic devices in clinical settings. Cleaning of electronic devices must comply with the organization's infection control policy and procedures. If the device becomes contaminated, it should be cleaned with the recommended disinfectant. If a patient is in isolation, the electronic device cann ot be taken into the patient's room unless it is approved within the organization's infection control policy and procedures. Intellectual Property All course materials developed by the faculty and posted within a course are the intellectual property of th e individual faculty and can only be used for the purpose of participating in the course in which they are posted, unless express consent is given by the faculty member. Any posting of course materials outside the enrolled course violates the intellectual property rights of faculty. The student is referred to the Academic Integrity and Plagiarism: Intellectual Property and Fair Use policy, available at http://libr ary.tamu.edu/services/library_tutorials/academic_integrity/index.html. Netiquette & Discussion Board Expectations Guidelines for acceptable online classroom behavior are posted in the learning management system course syllabus. Students will be expected to adhere to rules for acceptable online behavior and communication. 66 Expectations for course discussion board posts and grading criteria are posted in each course learning management system website. Standard grading rubric are used throughout the graduate nursing program, although frequency and subject matter will differ per course. Exam Guidelines Exams are given by c omputer or occasional written tests. Be prepared with appropriate supplies for either. It is the expectation of the SON that every student has a computer capable of running the required software for all assignments, exams, and quizzes. It is the responsibility of the student to download and install the software as directed. Students are required to act with integrity according to the Aggie Honor Code while preparing for and taking all nursing school examinations. Contents of all exams are consider ed confidential and are not to be shared with other students through verbal, written , or electronic communications. No attempt should be made to acquire, save or reproduce exam content. The use of outside materials (i.e. written materials, electronic devic es) is strictly forbidden on all exams (except in specific cases in which the students will be notified by the exam instructor or proctor ahead of the exam). Failure to adhere to these policies could result in corrective actions up to and including dismiss al from the SON . In fairness to all exam takers, it will not be possible for examination proctors to answer questions of interpretation that may arise during examinations. After completion of the examination, you may receive a preliminary raw score at the discretion of course faculty. This raw score may change following the statistical review by faculty. After faculty have completed a detailed examination question analysis and all students have taken the exam, you will receive a final examination sco re. Typically, examination results will be released in the Learning Management System within three to five working days following an examination, but may take longer under certain circumstances. Individual exam item appeals are not permitted. There is no c urving of grades. Refer to the syllabus provided with each SON course for detailed exam guidelines. HIPAA Policy All educational experiences in the SON abide by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) regulations. In addition, the SON adheres to the new national privacy standards issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that went into effect on February 17, 2010. HIPAA standards address the use and disclosure of individuals' health information as well as standards for individuals' privacy rights to understand and to control how their health information is used. A major goal of this act is to assure that individuals' health information is properly protected while allowing 67 the flow of health information needed to provide and promote high quality health care and to protect the public's health and well -being. Students are provided orientations in the classroom and clinical settings regarding HIPAA regulations in addition to completing online modules covering these regulatio ns prior to entering into a patient care setting. It is the legal and ethical responsibility of SON faculty, staff, and students to use, protect, and preserve personal and confidential patient information in accordance with state and federal laws as we ll as university policies. If an unauthorized use or disclosure of public health information has occurred, this incident must be reported immediately to the supervisor (i.e. a SON student notifies SON faculty instructor, SON staff notifies SON supervisor, SON faculty notifies ADAA ). The supervisor initiates an investigation, completes an incident report with findings and outcomes, notifies the clinical site and SON ADAA , and submits the report to SON Dean for review. Needlestick Guidelines The SON endorses standard precautions as the single best strategy to reduce the risk of bloodborne pathogen (BBP) exposure. Healthcare personnel are at risk for occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens, including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Exposures occur through needlesticks or cuts from other sharp instruments contaminated with an infected patient's blood or through contact of the eye, nose, mouth, or skin with a patient's blood. Adequate barrier protection (e.g., gloves, safety glasses, mask) when performing any activities is needed where the potential exists for BBP exposure. Familiarity with and use of safety devices on needles, syringes, and intravenous equipment can also reduce the risk of ac cidental BBP exposure. All healthcare personnel who have a reasonable chance of exposure to blood or body fluids should receive hepatitis B vaccine. Healthcare workers should be tested 1 -2 months after the vaccine series is complete to make sure that vacc ination has provided immunity to HBV infection. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) alone or in combination with vaccine (if not previously vaccinated) is effective in preventing HBV infection after an exposure. There is no vaccine against hepatitis C and n o treatment after an exposure that will prevent infection. Neither immune globulin nor antiviral therapy is recommended after exposure. For these reasons, following recommended infection control pra ctices to prevent percutaneous injuries is imperative. Center for Disease Control (CDC) Guidelines may be found here. 68 There is no vaccine against H IV. However, results from a small number of studies suggest that the use of some antiretroviral drugs after certain occupational exposures may reduce the chance of HIV transmission. Post -exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is recommended for certain occupational ex posures that pose a risk of transmission. Students who have been exposed to needlesticks or to potentially infectious blood or blood products or body fluids should be evaluated and have treatment initiated within 2 hours according to established criteria t hat conform to federal and state law and Center for Disease Control standards. Any expenses incurred by treatment are the sole responsibility of the student. First Aid for percutaneous and mucocutaneous exposures: 1. Needlesticks or puncture wounds: express blood from wound, scrub area vigorously with soap and water for 5 minutes. 2. Oral mucous membranes: rinse area several times with oxygenating agent such as 50% strength hydrogen peroxide. Do not swallow. 3. Ocular (remove contacts if applicable): irrigate immediately with water or NS solution. 4. Human bite: cleanse with povidone -iodine and sterile water. Exposure to Blood Borne Pathogens Procedure Immediately upon receiving a contaminated needlestick or exposure to blood, blood products, or body fluids, the student will: 1. Begin first aid measures 2. Report the incident to the clinical faculty member/preceptor and the appropriate person in th e clinical agency. 3. Complete the appropriate clinical agency incident report. If incident does not occur within a clinical facility, follow SON reporting requirements as required by the Occupational Health & Safety A dministration (OSHA). 4. Follow institutional protocols regarding wound care and reporting procedures. Clinical faculty should be notified as soon as reasonably possible. 5. Seek treatment intervention from the University Hea lth Center, or a private health care provider within 2 hours of the exposure incident (at student's expense). Based on information provided to the health care provider, baseline lab values may be ordered. In responding to an incident in which a student ex periences a contaminated needle stick or exposure to blood, blood products, or body fluids, the clinical faculty will: 1. Verify appropriate first aid measures have been initiated. 69 2. Counsel the student to seek follow -up care at the University Health Center o r a private health care provider. 3. Confirm with Chief Nursing Officer (or appropriate personnel) that appropriate patient testing is currently available or has been initiated. 4. Advise the student to consult the clinical facility's protocol or the CDC for follow -up on contaminated needlesticks or exposures to blood, blood products, or body fluids should he/she choose to seek a private health care provider. 5. Assist the student in completing any administrative paperwork that may be required. 6. Complete the SON Needle Stick Incident/Exposure Report Form References: Centers for Disease Control. (2016).

Substance Abuse Rules The Texas A&M University Sys tem is committed to maintaining an environment that is free from substance abuse, as well as complying with state and federal laws. The Texas A&M System policy governing this may be found in the following regulation: 34.02 Drug and Alcohol Abuse and Rehabilitation Programs . As health care professionals, the SON faculty members support a policy wherein each individual providing patient care in a clinical setting or preparing educationally to become a care provider adheres to high personal health standards. This includes, b ut is not limited to, the avoidance of substances that impair thinking and behavior. The SON requires all students to participate in a drug screen after admission into the program through a company determined by the SON . Pre -licensure students are required to repeat screening annually at minimum. RN to BSN students must be drug screened after admission and as required by their employers and clinical agencies for practicum experiences. The student is responsible for obtai ning the drug screens at their expense. Drug screens will be completed through the CastleBranch portal. If a positive drug screen is reported, the student will not be allowed to continue in the program. The student will be required to withdraw from all cou rses with the grade earned at that point in the semester. To return to the program, the student must re -apply and be accepted, have a negative drug screen, and provide satisfactory documentation to the SON of successful drug counseling and treatmen t, all at the expense of the student. If accepted 70 back into the program, he/she will be subjected to unannounced random drug screening at their expense. For the protection of patients, faculty, staff, and students, the SON retains the right to require a student to submit to testing for substance abuse at the student's expense when the nursing program has reasonable cause to believe that a student is abusing controlled substances. Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of drug use or th e physical symptoms or manifestations of being under the influence of a drug or alcohol, such as, but not limited to, slurred speech, noticeable change in grooming habits, impaired physical coordination, inappropriate comments or behaviors, or pupillary ch anges Abnormal conduct or erratic behavior, absenteeism, tardiness or deterioration in performance Report of drug use provided by credible sources Evidence that a student has tampered with a previous drug or alcohol test Possession of drug paraphernalia If a faculty member observes such behavior, and if such behavior is observed or validated by another faculty member or clinical agency staff member, the faculty member must excuse or remove the student from the educational or patient setting immediately. The student will be transported immediately to the designated site for a drug screen. The cost of the testing will be the responsibility of the SON . Reports will be sent to the Dean and ADSA . If questionable behavior is observed by a preceptor or other ag ency personnel overseeing a student's clinical experience performed in conjunction with, or as a component of, meeting the requirements of a course of study in the SON , such preceptor or other agency personnel and a member of the nursing staff, in the i nterest of patient safety, shall have the authority to take action in the same manner as an assigned faculty member. Additional Testing Conditions During the clinical experience, students may be required to undergo additional substance abuse testing if the following situations arise at the facility: An injury occurs while participating in a clinical experience If a medication or handling discrepancy is discovered If medication may have been stolen or improperly used Other conditions whe rein all employees of the facility are required to undergo testing 71 Description of the Drug Screen Panel The SON requires each student to submit to a 10 panel urine screening. The panel includes the following classes of drugs: Amphetamines, completed through the CastleBranch portal. Appeal and Retesting Guidelines Drug screen results will be reviewed by the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs. Positive tests may be appealed by submitting a written request to the ADSA within three (3) business days after being informed of positive test results. The appellant has the right to have a second test performed at a certified laboratory of their choice a nd all expenses of such retest will be the responsibility of the appellant. The specimen transfer between laboratories will follow standard protocol. Disciplinary/Actions Any student who fails an alcohol or drug test will be subject to disciplinary sanct ions and a disciplinary hearing. These sanctions could result in dismissal. An individual's participation in and successful completion of an approved drug or alcohol counseling program coupled with consent to random testing may be considered in the discipl inary process but does not ensure that dismissal will not occur. The Dean will make the final decision on action to be taken. TBON requires formal disclosure of an outstanding eligibility issue that may prevent an applicant from taking the licensure examin ation. A Declaratory Order petition must be filed if there has been any history of substance abuse. For more information, go to: Online Examination Application - Eligibility Information . See further information below regarding the responsibility of the SON as it relates to reporting substance abuse. Refusal to Consent to Testing Any student who refuses to consent to an alcohol or drug test or fails to provide an adequate specimen will be subject to discipline, up to and including dismissal. Confidentiality TBON has a policy that any substance -related condition(s) may affect the ability of a nurse to safely perform nursing duties, thus creating a threat to public safety. The policy applies to all nurses or those individuals seeking to obtain licensure. A nursing education program shall report a student to TBON if they have reasona ble cause to suspect that the ability of the nursing student to perform the services of the nursing profession would be, or would reasonably be expected to be, impaired by chemical dependency (as noted in the Nursing Practice Act Sections \u00a7301.404. Duty of Nursing Educational Program to Report ). Students should be aware that test results may be used for administrative hear ings and court cases and may be sent to state and/or federal agencies as required by applicable law. Beyond the 72 scope of these regulations, every effort will be made to keep the results of alcohol and drug testing confidential. Transportation Expectation s The SON transportation policy requires that students are responsible for arranging their own transportation, including to and from clinical sites. Students are required to have reliable transportation to and from campus, to clinical rotations off campus, and to oth er community activities as required. In order to provide the best possible clinical experiences, the SON may establish placements that require travel outside the campus locations. Lack of transportation will not be accepted as an excused absence for no n-attendance or tardiness at experiential or clinical rotations. Students will be responsible for covering all gas and parking fees incurred by that mode of travel. Carpooling and cost sharing with fellow students is recommended whenever feasible. The stud ent would be responsible for paying all transportation costs incurred. The state of Texas requires all drivers to maintain minimum liability automobile insurance coverage. Student Volunteer Observation School of Nursing students may volunteer in area hospitals, clinics, and agencies as observational experiences. However, it is important for students to note the issues related to the scope of practice in the student role, as well as student personal liability wh en participating in such experiences. Observational experiences that are voluntary and that exist outside approved SON clinical experiences do not qualify for clinical hours and these experiences must be completed during students' own time. Additio nally, students may function in the role of an RN as a part of clinical learning in the BSN program during SON - approved clinical experiences ONLY. During volunteer observational experiences, students may inform the agency they are a nursing student at Texas A&M University however, under no circumstances may a nursing student wear Texas A & M scrubs, Texas A & M polos, or any Texas A & M identification badge or function in the nursing student role. Students should be aware that (1) the SON assumes no responsibility for student activities while observing in these agencies; (2) students are personally responsible and liable for any activity engaged in while participating in the observation experience (3) professional liability insurance purcha sed by students covers activities engaged in during student practice in approved SON clinical experiences only; (4) students who practice illegally as outlined in the Nurse Practice Act and the Texas Board of Nursing (TBON) rules jeopardize their future careers; violations of TBON rules may result in the inability of a student to sit 73 for state board examinations and subsequent RN licensure; and (6) students are expected to uphold Aggie core values through their manner and dress. Chapter 8: Stude nt Conduct Code Procedures The University views the student conduct system as an educational experience that can result in growth in personal understanding of one's responsibilities and privileges in the University community. Accept able standards of conduct have been established to protect the rights of others and the orderly operation of the University. Part II: Student Life Rules provide direction on student expectations and consequences for misconduct. The focus of student conduct proceedings is to determine whether the University's standards of conduct have been violated. To this end, student conduct proceedings attempt to balanc e an understanding and knowledge of the students' needs with the needs of the University community. Individuals may bring a complaint against a student for alleged violations of the Student Conduct Code. Such complaints may be submitted to the Office of th e Dean of Student Life. An investigation may be initiated to determine if the complaint has merit. Complaints may result in charges, a form of alternative dispute resolution, or dismissal of complaint. These decisions are made at the sole discretion of the University. To ensure that students understand how to appropriately pursue a grievance at Texas A&M University, students are encouraged to seek clarification and advice regarding procedures before initiating a grievance. Although a student may seek such advice from an y faculty or staff member, the Office of the Dean of Student Life has staff members trained to help students who have grievances. Professional Code of Ethics The nursing profession expresses its moral obligations and professional va lues through the Code of Ethics for Nurses (ANA, 2017). Each student should read the American Nurses Association Code of Ethics and be accountable for its contents. Ethics is the foundation upon which nursing is built. Nursing has a distinguished history of concern for the welfare of the sick, injured and vulnerable. This concern is embodied in the provision of nursing care to individuals and the community. The Code of Ethics for a profession makes explicit the primary goals, values, and obligations of the profession. Students are expected to function within the framework of the American Nurses Ass ociation Code for Nurses. 74 Nursing students are expected not only to adhere to the morals and norms of the profession, but also to embrace them as part of what it means to be a nurse. The nurse recognizes that their first obligation is to the patient's wel fare. Any situation that threatens patient safety, exhibits a lack of moral character, demonstrates a lack of professionalism or good judgment, and/or is a violation of SON /Hospital policy may result in immediate termination from the program. Verbal or written derogatory statements about patients, clinical placements, the Health Science Center, SON students, faculty or staff will be subject to disciplinary action. This includes postings on internet social networking sites (i.e. Face book, Twitter, YouTube, etc.) Students are expected to demonstrate and embrace the following principles: Be responsible for their own learning and clinical practice and honor other students' right to learn and be successful in academic and clinical environments. Demonstrate respect in verbal and non -verbal behaviors to all others in clinical and academic settings. The use of abusive language or disruptive behavior directed toward faculty, staff, or other students will not be tolerated. Provide safe, competent care, seeking assistance when personal knowledge and/or skill are not adequate. Avoid use of any substances that would impair clinical ability or judgment. Provide the same standard of care to all patients and families regardless of race, ethnicity, age, sexual preference, disability, religion, economic status, employment status, or the nature of their health problem. Accept tha t others have the right to their own cultural beliefs and values and respect their choices. Document in a thorough, accurate, truthful, and timely manner data that reflects findings from one's own personal assessment, care, interventions, teaching, or the patient's and/or family's response to those activities. Act in a manner that contributes to the development and maintenance of an ethical educational and practice environment. Recognize that the primary commitment in clinical practice is to the patient a nd that respectful interactions are expected. Complete legally required HIPAA training and University or clinical site requirements regarding confidentiality prior to the beginning of the academic year. Use patient data in all school work, papers, present ations, research findings and in the clinical setting in a manner that is accurate, truthful, and confidential. Refrain from unauthorized use or possession of school or clinical setting's equipment, patient's belongings, or items dispersed or intended for patient use. Students may purchase the Code of Ethics for Nurses by contacting the American Nurses Association Publishing Company. 75 Disciplinary Penalties for Violation of Professional Code of Conduct One or more of the following penalties may be assessed for violation of any provision of Academic Integrity and Honesty, Code of Conduct, or SON professio nal standards policies: Written reprimand Financial restitution for any property damage or for any property destroyed or taken and not returned Grade adjustment Special remediation report or community service project based on the nature of the offense, to be determined by the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs . The ADAA shall set a reasonable date for completion of the project or report. Disciplinary probation for a definite period of time Suspension for a definite period of time Revocation of academic credit, requiring repetition of course work Dismissal Bar against readmission Denial of degree Revocation of degree and surrender of diploma Disciplinary probation, suspension, dismissal, bar against readmission, denial of degree and revocation /surrender of degree will be recorded on the academic transcript.

Violation s of professional standards should be reported in writing to ADSA by the reporting party within 10 bus iness days of the violation . The ADSA will investigate the complaint. Procedures for Handling Uncontested Case Investigations If it appears that a student has breached SON rules or procedures in such a way that there is a reasonable concern that injury or harm may come to patients, faculty, staff, students or the facility, interim disciplinary action may be tak en in the best interest of the individuals 76 involved and the SON . Such action may result in written notification up to and including immediate suspension of the student pending final disposition of the case. If, after full investigation, the complaint turns out to be founded and the infraction warrants removal from participation in any part of the curriculum, suspension, dismissal from the SON , bar from readmission, denial of degree, revocation or surre nder of a degree, ADAA will apply one or more disciplinary penalties. If the student does not contest the f acts of the incident, they must sign a written admission that the violation took place and that the facts reported are accurate. This admission will be recorded by the ADAA as a disciplinary infraction and the disciplinary action will be imposed . The student has the right of appeal to the Dean in writing within ten (10) university business days for penalty only. In these cases the Dean's decision is final. Procedures for Handling Contested Case Investigations If an incident cannot be handled as an uncontested offense, the SON has two (2) options of addressing the case: 1) refer the case to the Aggie Honor System Office for reported violations of the Aggie Code of Honor and/or , 2) initiate formal procedures to review the case as outlined in this section upon the written request of the student . The request should be sent to the professor (if course related) and the ADSA . The ADSA shall investigate the allegations that a student has violated one or more of the rules of the SON. 1. If the allegations are determined to be of a m inor nature that can be handled informally without initiation of disciplinary proceedings, the person filing the complaint, the student, and the Dean will be informed of this decision. 2. If the investigation reveals that the evidence presented substantiates a likely breach of professional conduct, the ADSA will initiate a hearing. The ADSA shall prepare a written notification to the student to be either hand delivered, with written acknowledgement of receipt, or sent by certified mail, return receipt request ed, containing the following: a statement of the charge(s) against the student with a description documenting the violation(s) a statement of the date, time, and place of the hearing on the charges.

The ADSA and/or the AD AA will present the case to the committee by stating any pertinent evidence along with an explanation of the investigative process. The ADAA/ADSA will address any questions the committee or the accused has in regard to the evidence or the investigation process. The SON has the burden of presenting the evidence and proving the charges by a preponderance of evidence. Evidence, to be admissible, need not meet the standards of admissibility established by the rules of evidence. The student has the right to be present at the hearing and may question witnesses. The student has the opportunity to present their version of the facts through personal statements, affidavits or witnesses. The student may have legal counsel present to provide advice but cannot question or interview other participants in the proceedings.
