Claims submitted by the deadline for each category of service will be adjudicated and paid subject to their eligibility and the availability of funds. What other resources are available to providers and/or uninsured individuals after the Uninsured Program winds down? Alternative resources for uninsured individuals who need COVID-19 services or other health care coverage include: [Medicaid enrollment](https://www.medicaid.gov/about-us/beneficiary-resources/index.html) [Healthcare Health Center](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/) Note: per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Requirements for COVID-19 Vaccination Program Providers, providers must continue to administer COVID-19 vaccines at no out-of-pocket cost to recipients. I submitted claims before the submission deadline was announced on March 15, 2022. Will those claims be paid? Claims submitted by the deadline for each category of service will be adjudicated and paid subject to their eligibility and the availability of funds. What will happen if I submit a testing or treatment claim after March 22, 2022? Testing and treatment claims submitted after the deadline will NOT be adjudicated. Regardless of whether the system shows your claim as having being received, no testing or treatment claim submitted after March 22, 2022, will be processed. Will eligible claims submitted by the deadline be processed and reimbursed within the typical 30 business days? HRSA anticipates that claims submitted by the deadline may take longer than the typical 30 business day timeframe to process as HRSA works to adjudicate and pay claims subject to their eligibility and the availability of funds. How should health care organizations bill for the COVID-19 related testing and treatment services they provide to uninsured individuals? HRSA is unable to provide general legal advice regarding a provider's billing practices for testing and treatment services for the uninsured beyond the scope of the HRSA COVID-19 Uninsured Program. How does exhaustion of funding for the Uninsured Program and Coverage Assistance Fund affect providers participating in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program? On April 5, 2022, CDC issued the following statement: Due to the lack of supplemental funding from Congress, HRSA stopped accepting claims for reimbursement of costs associated with administering COVID-19 vaccines to uninsured and underinsured individuals as of 11:59 PM ET on April 5, 2022. CDC strongly encourages providers to stay in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program and CDC expects participating providers will continue to administer these lifesaving vaccines at no cost to patients to ensure equitable access for all individuals. Where CDC becomes aware of a provider engaging in any of the following, CDC will consider taking any and all appropriate measures, including the possibility of rescinding the CDC provider agreement: - Administering COVID-19 Vaccine at any out-of-pocket cost to the recipient - Denying anyone vaccination, or differentially reducing appointment access, based on the vaccine recipient's coverage status or network status - Charging an office visit or other fee if COVID-19 vaccination is the sole medical service provided - Requiring additional medical services to receive COVID-19 vaccination - Seeking any reimbursement, including through balance billing, from the vaccine recipient For further information please see [CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider "}
