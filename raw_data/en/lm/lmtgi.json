The British Medical Journal states that Women who use infertility Acupuncture with IVF have a 65% increased chance of a successful conception. Cosmetic Acupuncture Cosmetic Acupuncture is a completely natural non-surgical facial. It is a natural alternative to invasive injections, fillers and chemical treatments. Cosmetic Acupuncture works on the collagen in your skin to tone, lift, rejuvenate and remove fine lines & wrinkles Acupuncture for Pain Acupuncture is medically proven to reduce and treat all types of pain - both acute and chronic. As an acupuncturist, it is very rewarding to bring immediate relief to those of my patients suffering pain. Acupuncture is wonderful for treating musculoskeletal pain as well as nerve pain. Homeopathy Homeopathy uses natural plant, herb and mineral extracts to stimulate the bodies own healing responses and works at a very deep level to cure from within rather then suppress. Homeopathy works at the physical level and just as importantly, at a mental and emotional level. Homeopathy looks at the effect of ones emotional state and sees the effect this has on the general health. It is then used to address both sides of our being. Therefore it is highly effective and totally safe. All of us had times where we are stressed and then get a stomach ache or a headache or other physical symptom....Homeopathy understands and treats the deep link between your emotional well being and the physical symptoms you suffer. IVF And Infertility Couples having difficulty in conceiving are often in a very distressed and vulnerable situation. If and when as a couple you decide to have children, it is right that you explore all avenues to assist that magical goal of having a safe and successful pregnancy. There are many many factors that effect a couples ability to conceive and have a successful pregnancy. Expert, experienced and sympathetic holistic care can be a vital ingredient in achieving these aims and has many times in my own practice, meant the difference between reaching that goal and experiencing continued anxiety and distress that unfortunately acts further to reduce your chances. A Look at the Whole Picture - not just seeing you as people attached to an egg & sperm ! First it is important for you to appreciate that Acupuncture has a strong scientific basis that has proven clinical effectiveness in assisting successful outcomes for IVF and also natural conception. Acupuncture with IVF can increase the chance of pregnancy by 65% as documented in the British Medical Journal. Furthermore, getting pregnant is really only half the battle. Fertility Acupuncture improves the chances of a full term successful pregnancy and a live birth by nearly 90%. I have placed a references guide at the bottom of this page and would be delighted if you took some time to read these. As a practitioner, I will look at you holistically as a couple. I will explore many areas of your health, well being and emotional states. These all have an impact on the chances of successful conception. I take time to understand the issues and use experience from all the branches of alternative therapy that I practice to formulate a treatment plan. The treatment is individualised and works to harmonise the body's internal organs and energy in order to give each couple the best chance for successful conception. Both men and women should be supported for at least 3 months prior to the IVF procedure. For men, acupuncture and Chinese medicine can improve the quality and quantity off semen. This improves the health of the embryo which in turn reduces the risk of miscarriage. For women, it can improve the quality and quantity of the eggs to help create healthy embryos. It can also regulate oestrogen and progesterone levels, thereby thickening the lining of the uterus. Research shows that increased blood flow to the uterus can help promote the implantation of the embryo. Whatever stage you are at, please give me a call and I can discuss the options and individual issues with you.

I see many patients who have never had any problems and all of a sudden develop hay fever, rashes, hives, food intolerances and all manner of allergy issues. The prevalence of Eczema and Asthma in children has now risen to 1 in 3 ! What is going on ? The medics are doing lots of research into this area and although there are many theories, there is no definitive answer. The result is that many people are resigned to popping anti-histamines, squirting nasal sprays with steroids and rubbing in cream after cream to supress the symptoms. Unfortunately these conventional treatments can also cause unwanted side effects. An allergy triggers your body to turn on itself (an Auto-Immune response) and release histamine which causes the outwardly symptoms you suffer. Conventional treatment focusses on alleviating the outwardly irritation without getting to the underlying root. There is a better way - the natural way - let me explain : Natural Ways to Cure Allergies As a complimentary practitioner, I have learnt that the root cause of your allergy lies in an imbalance / disturbance in the natural energy flow around your body. This disturbance causes your body to \"forget\" how to deal with the thing (allergen) that is triggering your allergy and that is why you get allergies suddenly during your life. The body's \"memory\" can be lost by stress, illness, diet, emotional problems or a whole manner of other issues. By using Homeopathy and a technique known as Kinesiology (like acupuncture but without needles), I can assess the root cause of the energy disturbance and help the body to \"remember\" how to deal with the trigger. The idea is not to treat the surface rash or the itchy eyes, but rather to treat the underlying cause so that your body no longer produces histamine in response to the trigger substance. Treatment is very simple. There is an initial consultation (about 1 hour) where I take a detailed history that examines areas such as diet and stress as well as your physical general symptoms. You may lie on a couch and I will hold your arm and assess its resistance when near grass or cat hair or wheat or whatever substance you are allergic to. I will then give you a natural remedy to take and we schedule a follow-up to see how you get on. Does it Really Work or is it just \"mumbo-jumbo?\" You know I had the same thought when I went to see a complimentary practitioner for the first time. I was a sceptic, I admit. However, my first child had terrible Eczema from only 4 weeks old and had bad allergies to Nuts, Wheat, Dairy Products, Gluten and Seafood. As you can imagine this made his diet very challenging indeed. I went everywhere, including Great Ormond Street, and besides very strong steroid creams. There was no help. In desperation, I saw a Homeopath. Within 4 weeks of this first consultation he was drinking milk and eating Pizza for the first time in his life. He now enjoys a full and varied diet and there is no hint of eczema on his body. Thank God. My own example is also interesting. I developed a very bad case of Allergic Rhinitis - a condition where my nose ran like a tap 24 hours a day and I had puffy red eyes continuously. I was given heavy steroids, saw the top Ear, Nose and Throat specialists, but nothing helped. Around the same time as my son was treated, I also tried these therapies and can happily report that my allergy condition has been resolved. The real point I am making is that conventional medicine for these types of problems is still pretty crude, not very successful and can have bad side-effects. There are natural alternatives, that I purely by chance stumbled across, which have changed my life. I now enjoy seeing others get relief from these debilitating and chronic conditions. There are no side effects, everything is about getting your body to deal with the problem itself - with a little encouragement. So, I think there is not much to loose besides an hour or so of time and I recommend that you give it a go. I look forward to seeing you or just having a chat on the phone. Good Luck and stay well. "}
