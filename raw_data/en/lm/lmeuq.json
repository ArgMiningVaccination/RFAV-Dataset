Although ancient civilizations used essential oils, their essential oils were not the potent essential oils that we have today. Before we start, please keep in mind that just because essential oils are natural, does not mean they are safe. Please do your research first before using essential oils. Many essential oils are not safe to use on or around your youngsters and around pets, especially cats. Some say you can ingest essential oils while others say you cannot. Here at Enchanted Aromatics, we do not advocate ingesting essential oils. We have done a great deal of research on the subject of ingesting essential oils. For more information about the dangers of ingesting essential oils, check out our article \" [Ingesting essential oils myths and truths](https://www.enchantedaromatics.com/ingesting-essential-oils-myths-truths/)\". If you do plan on ingesting essential oils, please do your research, and understand the risks. Also, this article only describes the essential oils that can be used for that specific property. The article does not discuss how to use the magical properties of essential oils to achieve the desired result. This article will list essential oils for spells, but will not tell you how to create or use that spells. How you use your essential oils is only limited by your imagination and creativity. When selecting an essential oil, you must use essential oils that have not been adulterated by unscrupulous distributors or sellers. If a company is selling a kit of 6 essential oils for $9.99, be wary. Essential oils require an enormous amount of plant material to create. As a result, pure essential oils can be quite expensive. If the essential oil is not pure, it may not have the specific property or desired results you are looking for. At worse, you may have an undesired or even a dangerous side effect depending on how you use your essential oils. By using pure essential oils, you will have access to the high vibration of each essential oil. These vibrations may help to support and affect your emotional, physical, and spiritual levels. Also, keep in mind that the essential oils we list for each property may not be the only essential oils that can be used. These are just our top picks. These essential oils were based upon research from various sources including books, the internet, and experience.
