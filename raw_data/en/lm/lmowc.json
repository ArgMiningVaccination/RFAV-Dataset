Anyone who has had a life -threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine should not get another dose. Anyone who is moderately or severely ill when a dose of vaccine is scheduled should probably wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. Pregnant women who need protection from HBV infection may be vaccinated. Hepatitis B vaccine risks Hepatitis B is a very safe vaccine. Most people do not have any problems with it. The vaccine contains non - infectious material and cannot cause hepatitis B infection. The following mild problems have been reported: Soreness where the shot was given (up to a bout 1 person in 4). Temperature of 99.9\u00b0F or higher (up to about 1 person in 15). Severe problems are extremely rare. Severe allergic reactions are believed to occur about once in 1.1 million doses. A vaccine, like any medicine, could cause a serious re action. But the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. More than 100 million people have gotten hepatitis B vaccine in the United States. What if there is a moderate or severe reaction? Look for any unusual condition, such as a severe allergic reaction, a very high fever or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakn ess. What should I do?
