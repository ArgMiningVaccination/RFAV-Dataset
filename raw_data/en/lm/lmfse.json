No specific regulations existed at the time they were marketed. The regulatory agencies therefore adapted them as a matter of urgency. Now that the pandemic emergency has passed, it is time to consider the safety issues associated with this rapid approval. The mode of action of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines should classify them as gene therapy products (GTPs), but they have been excluded by regulatory agencies. Some of the tests they have undergone as vaccines have produced non-compliant results in terms of purity, quality and batch homogeneity. The wide and persistent biodistribution of mRNAs and their protein products, incompletely studied due to their classification as vaccines, raises safety issues. Post-marketing studies have shown that mRNA passes into breast milk and could have adverse effects on breast-fed babies. Long-term expression, integration into the genome, transmission to the germline, passage into sperm, embryo/fetal and perinatal toxicity, genotoxicity and tumorigenicity should be studied in light of the adverse events reported in pharmacovigilance databases. The potential horizontal transmission (i.e., shedding) should also have been assessed. In-depth vaccinovigilance should be carried out. We would expect these controls to be required for future mRNA vaccines developed outside the context of a pandemic.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-06-22", "cleaned_text": "Safety Regulatory Issues [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241310514](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241310514) [The Future the mode of action of mRNA vaccines [ [2](#B2-ijms-24-10514)] should classify them as gene therapy products (GTP) [ [3](#B3-ijms-24-10514)]. But mRNAs as vaccines against an infectious disease have been excluded from GTP regulation by US and EU regulations [ [4](#B4-ijms-24-10514)]. No specific regulations existed before the year 2020 for mRNA vaccines. \"The current guidelines either do not apply, do not mention RNA therapeutics, or do not have widely accepted definition\" [ [5](#B5-ijms-24-10514)]. Regulatory agencies therefore had to adopt an emergency procedure to monitor the testing of these products, the rolling review. In rolling reviews, data are submitted and reviewed as they become available before the full data package is available and specific controls for this new platform have been requested [ [6](#B6-ijms-24-10514)]. [2](#B2-ijms-24-10514)], starting with influenza vaccines. Indeed, Sanofi is launching a clinical trial of the first mRNA-based seasonal flu vaccine candidate [ [7](#B7-ijms-24-10514)] and Moderna has many mRNA vaccines in clinical particular a phase 3 trial of the flu vaccine [ [8](#B8-ijms-24-10514)]. [9](#B9-ijms-24-10514)]. For these flu vaccines, emergency approval should not apply and the requirement for these additional studies should not be exceeded. [10](#B10-ijms-24-10514)]). 2. Current Regulation of Anti-COVID-19 mRNAs 2.1. The Mode of Action of mRNA Anti-COVID-19 Defines Them as GTP and Their Destiny as Vaccines [2](#B2-ijms-24-10514)]; they are nucleic acids intended to make the cells of the vaccinee produce an antigen, inducing the production of antibodies. This mode of action corresponds exactly to the regulatory agencies' definition of a GTP. [11](#B11-ijms-24-10514)]: \"The active substance consists of mRNA that is translated into the spike protein antigen of SARS-CoV-2; the LNP protects the RNA and enable transfection of hosts cells after IM delivery; the S protein induces an adaptive immune response\". [12](#B12-ijms-24-10514)], gene therapy is a medical intervention based on the modification of the genetic material of living cells. Cells may be altered in vivo by gene therapy given directly to the subject. [13](#B13-ijms-24-10514)], a GTP: (a) contains an active substance which contains or consists of a recombinant nucleic acid used in or administered to human beings with a view to regulating, repairing, replacing, adding or deleting a genetic sequence; and (b) in its therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic effects, relates directly to the recombinant nucleic acid sequence it contains, or to the product of the genetic expression of this sequence. [14](#B14-ijms-24-10514)] grant nucleic-acid-based vaccines the status of vaccines (\"antigens produced in vivo in the vaccinated host following administration of a live vector or nucleic acid or antigens produced by chemical synthesis in vitro\"). [15](#B15-ijms-24-10514)], a vaccine is a preventive medicine composed of one or more active substances of biological origin called antigens administered to protect against a disease. [16](#B16-ijms-24-10514)], a vaccine is a preparation that is used to stimulate the body's immune response against diseases. [17](#B17-ijms-24-10514)] and contain antigens capable of inducing active immunity against an infectious agent [ [4](#B4-ijms-24-10514)]. According to the EMA [ [11](#B11-ijms-24-10514)], the active substance of the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine is mRNA: it is not an antigen. Therefore, according to the European and French pharmacopoeias, mRNAs should not be considered as vaccines because they do not contain antigens. [18](#B18-ijms-24-10514)], mRNA vaccines correspond to the TypeIA of pro-drugs, which are substances that are converted by cells into active drugs. This pro-drug property could imply additional controls to those applied to vaccines. However, neither the FDA nor the EMA make any reference to these qualifications for mRNA anti-COVID-19 vaccines. 2.2. mRNAs as Vaccines against Infectious Disease Have Been Excluded from GTP Regulation by US and EU Regulations [12](#B12-ijms-24-10514)]. In 2007, the FDA distinguished between DNA plasmid vaccines according to whether they were for the prophylaxis of an infectious disease or not; DNA plasmids without indication in infectious diseases were subject to the regulation of gene therapy products, whilst DNA plasmid vaccines against infectious diseases were subject to a separate regulation inspired by those for GTP [ [19](#B19-ijms-24-10514)]. In 2013, the FDA confirmed that the regulation of gene therapy products did not apply to vaccines against infectious diseases [ [20](#B20-ijms-24-10514)]. In a 1996 document [ [21](#B21-ijms-24-10514)] on DNA plasmids for preventive infectious disease indications, it is specified (as for all FDA guidelines) that no subsequent requirements were established: these were non-binding recommendations. For this reason, this study will be based primarily on EMA documents; although EMA guidelines are not legally binding, applicants need to provide justification for any deviations. [13](#B13-ijms-24-10514)]. This exclusion was confirmed in 2015 [ [22](#B22-ijms-24-10514)]. For a history of the regulation of nucleic acids to prevent infectious diseases, see [Table 1](#ijms-24-10514-t001). [4](#B4-ijms-24-10514)]. 2.3. It Is Necessary to Underline the Contradictions of the Legislation [4](#B4-ijms-24-10514)]. This classification determines the controls and studies that must be carried out to obtain marketing authorizations. Thus, mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases are not classified as gene therapy products [ [17](#B17-ijms-24-10514)] (p. 162) and [ [22](#B22-ijms-24-10514)] whereas mRNA vaccines for the treatment of cancers are GTMPs (gene therapy medicinal products, which are part of ATMPs, advanced therapeutic medicinal products); in fact, mRNAs are GTMPs, according to the CAT (Committee for Advanced Therapies), and must therefore undergo complete pharmacokinetic studies [ [24](#B24-ijms-24-10514)]. [26](#B26-ijms-24-10514)]. Furthermore, BioNTech founder, Ugur Sahin, in a 2014 article, stated \"One would expect the classification of an mRNA drug to be a biologic, gene therapy, or somatic cell therapy\" [ [27](#B27-ijms-24-10514)]. Thus, the status of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was not well understood by the manufacturers themselves. [28](#B28-ijms-24-10514)]. [25](#B25-ijms-24-10514)]. 2.4. Why Are mRNA Vaccines Excluded from the Regulation of Gene Products? [4](#B4-ijms-24-10514)], \"it is difficult to answer with certainty why vaccines against infectious diseases have been excluded. The definition [of vaccines] has not changed since 1975, a period when there was no \"vaccine\" against cancer\" [ [17](#B17-ijms-24-10514)]; they are agents capable of producing active immunity against an infectious disease. At that time, the only existing vaccines were against infectious diseases and the current definition of a vaccine is limited to an immunological drug against an infectious disease. Therefore, an anti-cancer drug can, in no way, be called a \"vaccine\". It should be noted that therapeutic AIDS vaccines, based on lentiviruses and acting as gene therapies, because they integrate into the genome, have also been excluded from gene therapies [ [29](#B29-ijms-24-10514)]. It can be assumed that the applicant has argued that the product has both a therapeutic and a prophylactic mode of action, but the document is not available on the EMA website. [28](#B28-ijms-24-10514)], \"Since vaccines in most cases are given to large numbers of healthy individuals, there is a need for a solid nonclinical safety evaluation\". [30](#B30-ijms-24-10514)]) and the Vaccines Working Party [ [31](#B31-ijms-24-10514)]. 2.5. Required Controls for mRNAs Considered as Vaccines [17](#B17-ijms-24-10514)] (p. 117). These GMPs concern, among other things and for preclinical studies the assessment of environmental risks, the characterization of the product and raw materials (purity and quality), their control and stability, manufacturing methods, pharmacology studies (e.g., quantitative composition, description of the manufacturing process, raw materials not listed in a pharmacopoeia, identification and assay of the active substance, mode of action, in vitro or in vivo test of biological activity\u2014if assaying in the finished product is not possible\u2014toxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and embryo/fetal toxicity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics\u2014modification of physiology by the drug\u2014efficacy and product safety). For a new excipient, the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological information should be identical to that provided for the active substance [ [17](#B17-ijms-24-10514)] (p. 135). The WHO recommends the same type of controls for vaccines in general [ [14](#B14-ijms-24-10514)]. [17](#B17-ijms-24-10514)]. \"Pharmacokinetic studies are usually not required for vaccines. However, such studies might be applicable when new delivery systems are employed or when the vaccine contains novel adjuvants or excipients\" [ [23](#B23-ijms-24-10514)]. [28](#B28-ijms-24-10514)], for the EMA, the regulations should follow those of the WHO. The WHO guidelines [ [14](#B14-ijms-24-10514)] specified that a pharmacodynamic study may also extend to the pharmacology of an adjuvant and that distribution studies must be considered in the case of new formulations. When a new additive is to be used, for which toxicological data are not available, toxicity studies of the additive alone should first be performed and the results documented in accordance with the guidelines for new chemical entities. [23](#B23-ijms-24-10514)]. This document was drawn up before the exclusion of nucleic acid vaccines against infectious diseases from the GTP regulations. We will see below that the pharmacokinetic studies provided for anti-COVID-19 mRNAs are incomplete. 2.6. Controls Required as a Pro-Drug [18](#B18-ijms-24-10514)] points out the particular problems of pro-drugs raised by their more or less complete conversion into an active substance and the question of toxicity. According to the FDA, it is necessary to define how the pro-drug contributes significantly to the toxicity profile of the active drug, particularly as a function of the site of transformation and action. For mRNA vaccines, biological transformation occurs in many cell types and in all organs (see below), whereas the desired goal, i.e., immunization, will only occur in immune cells. However, mRNA vaccines are not classified as pro-drugs and therefore do not have to undergo the controls concerning the site of transformation and action. 2.7. Additional Controls Based on GTP Regulations [6](#B6-ijms-24-10514)]. It can be inferred from the EMA reports that the EMA has adapted the vaccine regulations and required certain controls specific to gene therapy products. This is what emerges from the analysis of the EPARs for Moderna [ [32](#B32-ijms-24-10514)] and the rolling [ [11](#B11-ijms-24-10514), [33](#B33-ijms-24-10514), [34](#B34-ijms-24-10514)]. [11](#B11-ijms-24-10514), [33](#B33-ijms-24-10514), [34](#B34-ijms-24-10514)] have not been fulfilled according to the 2021 report [ [35](#B35-ijms-24-10514)]. Regarding impurities, the method of determination of bacterial endotoxin should be specified [ [11](#B11-ijms-24-10514), [33](#B33-ijms-24-10514), [34](#B34-ijms-24-10514)]. The levels of endotoxin found are not specified in the documents of the Australian regulatory authority, the TGA, and some batches were still under evaluation at the time of batch release [ [36](#B36-ijms-24-10514)]. The accepted limit is 12.5 EU/mL [ [34](#B34-ijms-24-10514)]. [36](#B36-ijms-24-10514)], and the presence of truncated mRNA and truncated protein expression is not sufficiently explored [ [33](#B33-ijms-24-10514)]. EMA calls for a clarification of the mode of action [ [11](#B11-ijms-24-10514), [33](#B33-ijms-24-10514), [34](#B34-ijms-24-10514)]. 3. Controls Required by GTP Regulations to Which Anti-COVID-19 mRNAs Were Not Subjected 3.1. Product Quality [37](#B37-ijms-24-10514), [38](#B38-ijms-24-10514)]. Among these controls, the endotoxin level was not numerically provided (see above) and the interaction of nucleic acids with the vector was not studied. [37](#B37-ijms-24-10514)]; these studies have not been carried out. 3.2. Pharmacokinetics [24](#B24-ijms-24-10514), [38](#B38-ijms-24-10514)], even if this integration is unlikely [ [37](#B37-ijms-24-10514)], as it is the case for RNA. [38](#B38-ijms-24-10514)] that have not been performed. [40](#B40-ijms-24-10514)]), repeated toxicity and excretion in the environment. These studies are required for products containing DNA because the document was drafted in 2006 [ [37](#B37-ijms-24-10514)] and mRNA vaccines were not considered at the time. Repeated toxicity was not adequately studied because only two doses of vaccine were planned [ [32](#B32-ijms-24-10514)]. [23](#B23-ijms-24-10514)]. Moreover, \"the standard absorption/distribution/metabolism and excretion studies for conventional medicinal products may not be relevant for GTMPs\" [ [38](#B38-ijms-24-10514)]. For example, the route of administration that is considered as the worst case scenario (e.g., intravenous, representing the effect of widespread dissemination of the GTMP) should be considered. For GTPs, shedding studies are expected that address excretion and dissemination in the body, including studies on persistence, clearance and mobilization. Biodistribution studies should also address pharmacokinetic studies of the transgenic product (e.g., expressed proteins). The studies provided by the manufacturers seem to be incomplete from this point of view (see [Section 4](#sec4-ijms-24-10514)). 3.3. Controls on Biological Drugs Not Carried Out [41](#B41-ijms-24-10514)]. According to European regulations [ [17](#B17-ijms-24-10514)], for a biological drug, a list of biological activities must be provided, and studies of reproductive function, embryo-fetal and perinatal toxicity and mutagenic and carcinogenic potential must be considered. We have seen above that these tests have not been carried out, and that the biological activities of the active ingredient\u2014mRNA\u2014have not been sufficiently described. 3.4. Clinical Studies [38](#B38-ijms-24-10514)]. 3.5. Vaccinovigilance [24](#B24-ijms-24-10514)]. [42](#B42-ijms-24-10514)], a long-term follow-up of adverse events must be performed for at least 5 years for new clinical conditions, such as: new malignancy(ies), new incidence or exacerbation of a pre-existing neurologic disorders, new incidence or exacerbation of a prior rheumatologic or other autoimmune disorder, new incidence of a hematologic disorder and new incidence of infection (potentially product-related). [13](#B13-ijms-24-10514)], a strategy for the long-term follow-up of safety and efficacy shall be included in the risk management plan. [43](#B43-ijms-24-10514)], which is responsible for monitoring the safety profiles and benefit/risk ratios of vaccines, has published a guide for monitoring the selected adverse events of vaccines in general. Follow-up times are sometimes specified but rarely exceed 2 months [ [44](#B44-ijms-24-10514)] and, according to an FDA COVID-19 vaccine pharmacovigilance study [ [45](#B45-ijms-24-10514)], vaccinated individuals are followed for up to 42 days. 4. Discussion 4.1. Controls Required for a Pro-Drug That Have Not Been Carried Out [18](#B18-ijms-24-10514)]. It would thus have been detected that the spike protein translated from the mRNA is not only found in the immune cells of the muscle where the mRNA is injected. This point will be discussed below in [Section 4.3.1](#sec4dot3dot1-ijms-24-10514). 4.2. The Results of Certain Tests Required for Vaccines in General Are Not Satisfactory 4.2.1. Drug Substance Purity [17](#B17-ijms-24-10514)]; according to EMA [ [11](#B11-ijms-24-10514)], the purity of the Pfizer final product is variable depending on the manufacturing process. According to the \"Rapporteur Rolling Review critical assessment report\" obtained by FOIA [ [34](#B34-ijms-24-10514)] (pp. 81 and 102), which details the previous document, the purity of the product is well below 95% at the time of marketing and the acceptance criterion is 50%. In another document obtained by FOIA, this threshold is 58% for mRNAs [ [35](#B35-ijms-24-10514)] (p. 38). In the 2022 report for the Moderna vaccine adapted to the Omicron strain, the EMA again asks to reassess the need to adjust the purity specification limits at the level of the active substance [ [46](#B46-ijms-24-10514)]. These defects in product purity are questionable for a new formulation. [47](#B47-ijms-24-10514)] did not detect any batch heterogeneity. The document provided by the OCABR does not specify the controls performed by the reference laboratories regarding the identity, potency and integrity of the product. However, a heterogeneity in the toxicity of the batches has been published which could result from a heterogeneity of composition [ [48](#B48-ijms-24-10514)]. 4.2.2. Drug Substance Impurities [49](#B49-ijms-24-10514)]. This limit had been set in 1985 by the FDA at 10 pg per dose of vaccine, and raised by the WHO in 1986 to 100 pg per dose, then 10 ng per dose in 1996. [33](#B33-ijms-24-10514)] (p. 103). However, the EMA requests further information on the linear DNA template and the quantification method. [33](#B33-ijms-24-10514)], the results for residual DNA template and ds-RNA assays were highly heterogeneous between batches, although well below the accepted limits. It would be wise to re-evaluate assay methods and limits for future mRNA vaccines that will be evaluated outside a pandemic period. This is all the more true given that the final number of doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine that an individual will receive is not yet known. 4.2.3. Problem Posed by the Presence of Antibiotic Resistance Genes [33](#B33-ijms-24-10514)] (p. 26). Given the significant and variable quantities of contaminating DNA in the drug substance, there is concern that the resistance gene could be integrated into human digestive tract bacteria or somatic cells [ [37](#B37-ijms-24-10514)]. If anti-COVID-19 mRNAs had been subject to GTP regulation, these studies would have been carried out. 4.3. Controls Required for GTP That Were Not Performed: Safety Issues 4.3.1. mRNAs [11](#B11-ijms-24-10514)] (p. 54). Moreover, independent post-marketing studies have shown the distribution and persistence of the mRNA for several weeks in many organs [ [50](#B50-ijms-24-10514), [51](#B51-ijms-24-10514), [52](#B52-ijms-24-10514)]. The product of the mRNA, the spike, also circulates in the blood for several weeks [ [53](#B53-ijms-24-10514), [54](#B54-ijms-24-10514), [55](#B55-ijms-24-10514), [56](#B56-ijms-24-10514)]. The spike protein was found in the brain and the heart of a person who died 3 weeks after vaccination [ [57](#B57-ijms-24-10514)]. The spike was found in skin lesions up to 100 days after vaccination [ [58](#B58-ijms-24-10514)]. The preclinical studies provided by the manufacturers, therefore, appear to be incomplete from a pharmacokinetic standpoint, as they failed to detect this broad biodistribution and persistence. [32](#B32-ijms-24-10514)]. [11](#B11-ijms-24-10514)], biodistribution, genotoxicity and repeat toxicity studies were performed with mRNAs encoding proteins other than the SARS-CoV-2 spike. This is not compatible with the GTP regulations, as the EMA requires that distribution studies be conducted on the transgene, as included in the GTMP [ [37](#B37-ijms-24-10514)]. [38](#B38-ijms-24-10514)] requires that, in the event of signs of long term expression, unintended genomic integration and oncogenesis must be investigated. The duration and expression should be determined by RT-PCR and immunological assays and/or assays to detect functional protein. The over-expression of the transgene has to be monitored [ [38](#B38-ijms-24-10514)]. This should have been controlled, given that large quantities of the spike protein can be produced, sometimes in excess of those circulating in those with severe COVID-19. A comparison of spike concentrations achieved during disease and after vaccination shows that, during severe COVID-19, the median concentration observed is 50 pg/mL, with maximums at 1 ng/mL. During severe COVID-19 infection, levels of up to 135 pg/mL of S1 spike can be detected, most commonly between 6 and 50 pg/mL. After vaccination with mRNA vaccine concentrations, up to 150 pg/mL are commonly observed, but may reach 10 ng/mL in individuals with vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia [ [55](#B55-ijms-24-10514), [59](#B59-ijms-24-10514)]. 4.3.2. This Broad Biodistribution Should Have Made the Carrying Out of Controls Required for GTP Essential Germline Integration [11](#B11-ijms-24-10514)]. Genome integration studies are required for GTMP [ [24](#B24-ijms-24-10514)]. It was specified in 2009 that, for gene therapy medicinal products not expected to be capable of integration, integration studies must be carried out if the biodistribution of the product indicates a risk of germline transmission [ [13](#B13-ijms-24-10514)]. A 2005 document, dedicated specifically to the study of germline transmission of gene transfer vectors and naked DNA, specifies that only DNA, and not RNA, is presumed to pose a risk of germline modification [ [60](#B60-ijms-24-10514)]. This assertion can be questioned on the basis of two publications showing that, firstly, SARS-CoV-2 RNA can integrate into the genome [ [61](#B61-ijms-24-10514)] and, secondly, that the vaccine mRNA may be able to integrate into the genome of human cells in culture [ [62](#B62-ijms-24-10514)]. Although contested [ [63](#B63-ijms-24-10514)], these results would tend to require genome integration studies for mRNAs, especially since spike mRNA also translocates into the nucleus [ [64](#B64-ijms-24-10514)]. Genotoxicity [65](#B65-ijms-24-10514)] (p. 21). The conclusion was that \"Overall, the genotoxic risk to humans is considered to be low due to minimal systemic exposure following IM administration, limited duration of exposure, and negative in vitro results\". It would have been wise to continue these studies, since exposure is not limited to muscle, nor is the duration of exposure. As specified in the EMA regulations for GTPs \"If a positive finding occurs, additional testing will be needed to ensure the safety of the product\" [ [38](#B38-ijms-24-10514)]. Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity [65](#B65-ijms-24-10514)]. [66](#B66-ijms-24-10514)] and Japanese [ [67](#B67-ijms-24-10514)] regulatory agencies, skeletal malformations were also found in the Pfizer preclinical trial. The incidence of supernumerary lumbar ribs was higher in the treatment group compared with the control group, but was not considered to be treatment-related. This concordance of fetal anomalies with the two types of mRNA vaccines should have led to more detailed studies. Pharmacokinetics of Nanomedicine According to the FDA [17](#B17-ijms-24-10514)] (p. 135). Furthermore, according to Hemmrich and McNeil [ [68](#B68-ijms-24-10514)], the status of LNP components is confused, according to the FDA; they are considered either as \"starting materials\" (and therefore not as excipients) or as \"inactive ingredients\" (and therefore excipients) according to the documents whereas, according to the FDA itself, they should be considered as active ingredients. According to the same authors, developers must demonstrate the safety of the new ingredient, and \"excipients intended for long-term use may require repeated dose toxicology studies over 6 months and carcinogenicity studies over 2 years\". Indeed, the manufacturers intended only two doses of vaccine [ [46](#B46-ijms-24-10514)], but some populations are currently receiving up to six doses spaced a few months apart. The stability, toxicity and biodistribution of the intact nanoparticle containing the mRNA, the active substance, must be evaluated, rather than the isolated lipid components, contrary to what has been carried out (Moderna and Pfizer have partially evaluated the biodistribution of lipids in nanoparticles, or of nanoparticles containing mRNAs other than used in anti-COVID-19 vaccines) [ [11](#B11-ijms-24-10514), [32](#B32-ijms-24-10514), [33](#B33-ijms-24-10514), [34](#B34-ijms-24-10514)]. 4.4. Clinical Studies [11](#B11-ijms-24-10514)] (p. 56). Studies independent of the manufacturers have shown the passage of vaccine mRNA into breast milk in the first week following injection [ [69](#B69-ijms-24-10514), [70](#B70-ijms-24-10514), [71](#B71-ijms-24-10514), [72](#B72-ijms-24-10514)] and adverse effects on breast-fed babies could be due to this passage, according a FDA report [ [73](#B73-ijms-24-10514)]. Nanoparticles, similar to those in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, have been shown to be able to cross the placental barrier in mice [ [74](#B74-ijms-24-10514)]. Extensive preclinical and clinical studies should have explored this passage in milk and through the placenta. [75](#B75-ijms-24-10514), [76](#B76-ijms-24-10514)]. In addition, the spike protein may interact with the tumor suppressor [ [77](#B77-ijms-24-10514), [78](#B78-ijms-24-10514)] (p. 53). It would therefore be wise to explore the tumorigenic effect in vivo and to monitor any cancers developed by vaccinated individuals over the long term, especially as it has been suggested that cancers can be reactivated by mRNA vaccines [ [79](#B79-ijms-24-10514), [80](#B80-ijms-24-10514), [81](#B81-ijms-24-10514)] or Moderna announced that \"as of 13 April 2021 all placebo participants have been offered the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and 98% of those have received the vaccine\" [ [87](#B87-ijms-24-10514)]. [11](#B11-ijms-24-10514)], well below the FDA's long-term follow-up of adverse events for GTP, which is 5 to 15 years, and 30 years for the EMA. In addition to the extensive pharmacovigilance plan requested by the EMA [ [11](#B11-ijms-24-10514)], we could call for reinforced monitoring. As the placebo groups in the clinical trials were vaccinated, the long-term monitoring of these adverse effects could be carried out by retrospective observational studies comparing the incidence of pathologies according to participants' vaccination status. Two publications about adenovirus vectors [ [88](#B88-ijms-24-10514), [89](#B89-ijms-24-10514)] suggest that the long-term effects of gene therapy vectors, although they are not specifically mRNA vectors, clearly exemplify the lack of study and potential risks in the long term. [90](#B90-ijms-24-10514)] and aplastic anemia [ [91](#B91-ijms-24-10514)]. For neurological [57](#B57-ijms-24-10514)], rhomboencephalitis [ [92](#B92-ijms-24-10514)], demyelinization [ [93](#B93-ijms-24-10514)] and autoimmune neurological diseases [ [94](#B94-ijms-24-10514)] were noted. Rheumatological conditions [ [95](#B95-ijms-24-10514)], de novo autoimmune rheumatic diseases [ [96](#B96-ijms-24-10514)], autoimmune like myopathy [ [97](#B97-ijms-24-10514)] and new or exacerbated inflammatory diseases [ [94](#B94-ijms-24-10514)] have also been reported. [98](#B98-ijms-24-10514)] and non-covidial pneumonias vaccines [ [99](#B99-ijms-24-10514)]. 5. Conclusions [101](#B101-ijms-24-10514), [102](#B102-ijms-24-10514), [103](#B103-ijms-24-10514)] and has a recognized toxicity that was known since before COVID-19 [ [104](#B104-ijms-24-10514)] and has been confirmed since [ [105](#B105-ijms-24-10514), [106](#B106-ijms-24-10514), [107](#B107-ijms-24-10514), [108](#B108-ijms-24-10514)]. [109](#B109-ijms-24-10514), [110](#B110-ijms-24-10514)]. Randomized studies also showed negative results, reporting more frequent adverse events in the treatment group [ [111](#B111-ijms-24-10514), [112](#B112-ijms-24-10514)]. Concerning infectious diseases, two trials of mRNA vaccines encapsulated in LNPs showed notable adverse effects. A trial of an mRNA vaccine against rabies showed numerous adverse effects superior to those of the classic vaccine, which is already very reactogenic, notably lymphopenia (this effect was also found for anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccines) [ [113](#B113-ijms-24-10514)]. An influenza vaccine trial [ [114](#B114-ijms-24-10514)] showed severe adverse effects in humans (31 subjects were observed over only 43 days and at least 4 serious adverse effects were found). In a non-randomized trial against HIV [ [115](#B115-ijms-24-10514)], the response was inexplicably incomplete in some patients. According to another HIV trial of 15 participants against a placebo, immune responses were unsatisfactory and of limited duration [ [116](#B116-ijms-24-10514)]. The founder of BioNTech himself, Ugur Sahin, warned against the use of codon optimization, which can alter translation speed and lead to misfolding. He also underlined the potential toxicity of unnatural nucleotides. He also mentioned the wide biodistribution of mRNA injected intramuscularly. He reminded us that we should fear the appearance of anti-self mRNA antibodies in patients suffering from autoimmune diseases [ [27](#B27-ijms-24-10514)]. [117](#B117-ijms-24-10514)]. However, a wide-ranging public discussion should be opened on this transition to the routine use of mRNA vaccines, without them being subject to the controls required for GTPs. [118](#B118-ijms-24-10514)]. An article from early 2021 [ [119](#B119-ijms-24-10514)] emphasized the need for further studies to ensure the quality, efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines; it was written before these products were marketed. It seems important to clarify which additional controls should be required in light of the detailed results of the preclinical trials and safety data published in the post-marketing phase.
