High-dose vitamin C may be given by intravenous (IV) infusion or orally. When taken by intravenous infusion, Vitamin C can reach much higher levels in the blood than when taken by mouth. Vitamin C at low levels is a powerful antioxidant however at high doses it becomes an oxidant which breaks down in the body to produce hydrogen peroxide and used to fight cancer and pathogenic cells. Treatment: 1-3 hours Frequency: 2-5 days a week (cancer patients). Twice weekly for seven (7) weeks (autoimmune patients). Consultation: Required High Dose Vitamin C Therapy for Cancer / Oncology Treatment High Dose Vitamin C Therapy has been studied as a treatment for patients with cancer since the 1970s. However, it is gaining popularity as a complementary and even primary treatment for a lot of inflammatory and oxidative stress-related conditions, including cancer. All cancers, especially liver, breast, pancreatic, lung cancer and highly aggressive brain cancer, have all been shown to benefit from High Dose Vitamin C Therapy. Studies suggest that these higher levels of vitamin C are effective in the treatment of cancer cells. When free radicals build up faster than your body can manage, you end up with oxidative stress, which is an overload of free radicals that damages cells. Oxidative stress is a major factor in nearly every disease you can think of and can be traced to heart disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and so many more problems. Cancer develops when oxidative stress damages healthy cells' DNA, causing it to mutate and multiply. High Dose Vitamin C Therapy breaks down in the body to produce hydrogen peroxide to fight the tumor cells. Tumor cells with low levels of catalase enzyme activity are much less capable of removing hydrogen peroxide than normal cells, killing cancer cells. High-Dose Vitamin C as a Compliment for Cancer Treatment High Dose Vitamin C also works synergistically (complementary) with chemotherapy treatments to not only kill cancer cells more efficiently, but also protect normal cells and provide less chemotherapy treatment side effects. Standard cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation causes a lot of oxidative stress in the body which depletes Vitamin C. These surges in free radicals along with Vitamin C deficiency contribute to a lot of the adverse side effects of chemotherapy and radiation.
