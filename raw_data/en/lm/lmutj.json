Ancient cultures in Europe and Asia practiced regular cleansing techniques in order to improve the balance between the mind and body. These detoxification methods were often used in conjunction with physical activities such as yoga and mental activities such as meditation. Keeping the body and mind clean and clear was said to be the key to living a long and happy life. Today, people still choose to detoxify their bodies in order to look and feel their best. Modern diets typically include a lot of processed foods that can cause toxins to build up over time. Detoxifying your body can be one of the best ways restore its natural balance. Unfortunately, not all detoxification methods are created equal. Try out one of these safe and effective ways to detox your body naturally. Way #1: Fast. Your liver plays a key role in filtering toxins from your blood, but other organs such as your kidneys, lungs, and intestines also play a role in this process. A compromised digestive system will not effectively filter these toxins from your blood. One popular way to jumpstart your body's detoxification process is to perform intermittent fasting. This can be done in one of two ways. Some people prefer to do a daily fast. In order to do this, they limit their calorie intake to a set period of time each day, usually an 8 hour block of time. For example, one might eat between noon and 8pm each day and fast from 8pm until noon the next day. Another popular way that people choose to fast is by heavily restricting their calorie intake for 2 to 3 days. In some cases, this means consuming only water while in other cases people choose to incorporate fruit juice into their diets. If you choose to go this route, experts recommend drinking fresh squeezed juices that you make at home rather than commercially purchased juices. Store bought juices frequently have a lot of added sugars, making them a poor choice for a health conscious individual. Way #2: Increase blood flow. Another way to stimulate your body's natural detox systems is to increase your body's blood flow. Regular exercise can help to increase blood flow and improve overall health. A foam roller can be a great tool to use in conjunction with exercise. Roll out your muscles daily to increase circulation and encourage blood flow, stimulating your liver and digestive system and helping to speed up the removal of toxins from your bloodstream. Way #3: Clean up your diet. Another great way to eliminate toxins from your body is to clean up your diet. Cut out substances such as caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine. Limit your intake of refined sugars and saturated fats. This means that you should be avoiding most processed foods during your detox. Clean eating will make it easier for your body to detox naturally. Once your initial detox is complete, it is a good idea to keep up the clean eating in order to maintain this low level of toxins in your body. Way #4: Use natural cleaning products. An often overlooked way to detox your body is to limit the number of toxins that you come into contact with on a daily basis. During this time, you should limit your use of commercial cleaning products. This includes things like household cleaners filled with harsh chemicals. Opt instead for a naturally occurring substitute. Many people like to use essential oils such as a Thieves Household Cleaner in place of chemical based cleaning products. Thieves Cleaner is made up of clove, cinnamon, lemon, and eucalyptus oils. Together, these oils can naturally clean almost any surface in your home. Way #5: Limit stress. While this is easier said than done, minimizing your stress levels can go a long way towards keeping your body in balance. Stress triggers the release of cortisol, a hormone that has been linked to countless negative impacts on your health. These negatives include weight gain, increased blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart disease. Limiting the amount of cortisol in your bloodstream can go a long way towards helping your body rid itself of other toxins.
