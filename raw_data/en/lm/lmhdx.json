To inform the health system transformation that is required under the DSRIP program, emerging Performing Provider Systems (PPSs) must submit a comprehensive Community Needs Assessment (CNA) with their Project Plan applications. The Bronx PPS's CNA included primary and secondary data analysis. This report describes the primary data methodology and analysis and has been developed as an attachment to the full CNA, and to provide more in-depth information to the PPSs, whic h may be useful for DSRIP project planning, as well as planning and implementation of programs and services outside of the DSRIP program. METHODS The Center for Evaluation and Applied Research (CEA R) at The New York Academy of Medicine (NYAM) conducted the primary data portion of the CNA, which included 622 surveys of community residents, 22 focus groups and 23 inte rviews with Bronx residents, providers, and other stakeholders. The protocol was developed in collaboration with selected PPSs in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan and was impl emented in partnership with the PPSs as well as a number of Community Based Organizations ( CBOs). The primary data component was designed to address anticipated gaps in the secondary data, including: 1) community member and stakeholder pers pectives on health issues, as well as their causes and impact; 2) data on populations (e.g., pa rticular immigrant groups) and issues (e.g., links between food access and health) that might be obscured in population-based data sets; 3) significant detail on issues identified; and 4) rec ommended approaches to address reported problems. Overarching questions for the primary da ta component, which\u2014consistent with DSRIP\u2014focused on Medicaid and other low-income popu lations, as well as the uninsured, included: To what extent are community and environmental cond itions conducive to health promotion and disease prevention? What are the primary health concerns and health nee ds of residents, overall and according to neighborhood and socio-demographic characteristi cs? Bx App D - 2 What are the health related programming and servic es available to community residents, what organizations are providing the services, and what are the service gaps? Are there differences in access, use and perception s of health related programming and services according to neighborhood and according to ethnic, racial, and language groups? In what ways can health promotion and health care needs be better addressed, overall and for distinct populations? FINDINGS Bronx community members and other stakeholders are clearly interested in partnering with hospitals and health care providers and being part of solutions that promote good health and reduced hospitalizations. Many are wary, fearing t hat hospitals will not fully engage with the community going forward, as most lack experience do ing so and the financial incentives of health system re-engineering are unclear. The predo minant themes in the Bronx are persistent poverty, environmental hazards, and systemic neglec t. Focus group and interview participants articulated specific barriers to good health and go od health care, many of which were related to poverty and its consequences, including long work h ours, unstable housing, unsafe neighborhoods and the need to prioritize expenditur es\u2014even among basic needs. For specific groups, including the disabled, LGBTQ, criminal jus tice involved, and the homeless, health- related barriers were compounded, due to both attit udinal and practical considerations. Focus group and interview participants also articul ated potential \"fixes,\" such as increased ease of access for medical visits (e.g., reduced wait ti me, reduced insurance restrictions, increased integrated care); improved provider sensitivity; an d a range of supportive services, including community health workers, care coordinators\u2014particu larly for difficult to manage medical conditions and high risk populations\u2014and navigators . Health education, addressing (for example) prevention, screening, disease management, insurance, and appropriate use of health care services, was considered essential at the indi vidual and the community level, to ensure that the population has the knowledge and skills necessa ry for independent action that promotes their own good health. Bx App D - 3BRONX COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT OCTOBER 2014 INTRODUCTION The goal of the Delivery System Reform Incentive Pa yment (DSRIP) program is to promote community-level collaborations and focus on system reform in order to reduce avoidable inpatient admissions and emergency room visits by 2 5% over five years for the Medicaid and uninsured populations in New York State (NYS). To inform the health system transformation that is required under the DSRIP program, emerging Performing Provider Systems (PPSs) must submit a comprehensive Community Needs Assessment ( CNA) with their Project Plan applications. The Bronx PPS's CNAs, conducted fro m July through September, included primary and secondary data analysis and had the fol lowing aims: To describe health care and community resources; To describe the communities served by the PPSs; To identify the main health and health service chal lenges facing the community; and To summarize the assets, resources, and needs for p roposed DSRIP projects. This report describes the primary data methodology and findings and has been developed as an attachment to the full CNA. The primary data compo nent was intended to provide more in-depth information to the PPSs, which may be useful for DS RIP project planning, as well as planning and implementation of programs and services outside of DSRIP. METHODS PROTOCOL DESIGN The Center for Evaluation and Applied Research (CEA R) at The New York Academy of Medicine (NYAM) conducted the primary data portion of the CNA, which included surveys of community residents, and focus groups and interview s with Bronx residents, providers, and other stakeholders (see appendix for data collection inst ruments). The protocol was developed in collaboration with selected PPSs in the Bronx, Bro oklyn, Queens, and Manhattan and was approved by the NYAM Institutional Review Board (IR B). The primary data component was designed to address anticipated gaps in the secondary data, including: 1) community member and stakeholder pers pectives on health issues, as well as their causes and impact; 2) data on populations (e.g., pa rticular immigrant groups) and issues (e.g., links between food access and health) that might be obscured in population-based data sets; 3) significant detail on issues identified; and 4) rec ommended approaches to address reported problems. Overarching questions for the primary da ta component, which\u2014consistent with Bx App D - 4DSRIP\u2014focused on Medicaid and other low-income popu lations, as well as the uninsured, included: To what extent are community and environmental cond itions conducive to health promotion and disease prevention? What are the primary health concerns and health nee ds of residents, overall and according to neighborhood and socio-demographic characteristi cs? What are the health related programming and service s available to community residents, what organizations are providing the services, and what are the service gaps? Are there differences in access, use and perception s of health related programming and services according to neighborhood and according to ethnic, racial, and language groups? In what ways can health promotion and health care n eeds be better addressed, overall and for distinct populations? DATA COLLECTION Community Engagement: Consistent with DSRIP CNA gui dance, NYAM conducted primary data collection in collaboration with numerous comm unity organizations (see appendix for listing), which were identified with assistance fro m the PPS's, and represented a range of populations (e.g., older adults, immigrants) and ne ighborhoods. As described below, community organizations assisted in recruitment for and admin istration of focus groups and surveys. All organizations assisting with survey administration or focus group facilitation were provided with written guidelines including information on data co llection and the general research protocol, the voluntary nature of research, and confidentiality. Organizations also participated in an in-person or phone training on data collection conducted by N YAM staff. Community organizations partnering in the research received an agency honor arium consistent with their level of responsibility. As described in a subsequent section, community mem bers and stakeholders were largely responsive to the request to participate in the CNA . Although several expressed concern that their input and recommendations would not ultimatel y be used in the selection and planning of DSRIP projects, they appreciated the ultimate DSRIP aims and the opportunity to have their opinions heard. Data Collection Activities: As noted above, the pri mary data component involved three distinct methodologies: Resident Surveys : 622 surveys were completed by Bronx residents, ages 18 and older. Survey questions focused on basic demographics, hea lth concerns (individual and community-wide), health care utilization, barriers to care, and use of community and other Bx App D - 5services. Survey respondents were identified and r ecruited by local organizations, including community based organizations, senior centers, soci al service and health providers, and through NYAM initiated street outreach in targeted neighborhoods where we wanted to ensure sufficient representation, including Hunts P oint, Mott Haven, High Bridge, Tremont, Fordham Road, and Soundview. Surveys were self-admi nistered or administered by NYAM staff or staff or volunteers from community organiz ations (as described above), who were trained and supported in survey administration by N YAM staff and consultants. The surveys were translated into 10 languages: Arabic, Bangla, Chinese (simplified and traditional), Haitian Creole, French, Hindi, Korean, Polish, Russ ian and Spanish. Participants received a Metrocard valued at $10 for completing the survey. Key Informant Interviews: Twenty-three key informant interviews were conducted, including 29 individuals. Key informants were selected with input from the PPS's. A portion had population specific expertise, including particular immigrant groups, older adults, children and adolescents. Others had expertise in specific issues, including supportive housing, care coordination, corrections, and homelessness. All k ey informant interviews were conducted by NYAM staff using a pre-written interview guide. All key informants were asked about perceptions of health issues in the community, barr iers and facilitators to good health, health care and other service needs, and recommendations f or services and activities that may benefit the local population. Follow-up questions, asked on ad hoc basis, probed more deeply into the specific areas of expertise of key informants. The interview guide was designed for a discussion lasting 60 minutes; in fa ct, interviews ranged from 45 to 120+ minutes. All key informant interviews were audiota ped and professionally transcribed to ensure an accurate record and to allow for verbatim quotations. (See Appendix for the list of Key Informants by name, position, and organization. ) Focus Groups: Twenty-two focus groups were conducte d for the Bronx Community Needs Assessment, involving over 240 participants. Most of the focus groups were with community members, recruited by collaborating CBOs. Populati ons targeted included, but were not limited to, older adults; Latino, African, and southeast As ian immigrant populations, individuals with behavioral health issues, and individuals living in public housing. Community member interest in the focus groups was high, with some groups includi ng up to 30 individuals. In addition to the resident groups, we conducted a small number of foc us groups with community leaders, including hospital advisory board members. These g roups were coordinated by collaborating PPS's. Most focus group participants were female ( 62.8%), Black/African American or Latino (46.1% and 39.2%, respectively), and on Medicaid (5 7.6%); 10.8% were uninsured. The mean age of respondents was 49.6, with a standard deviat ion of 15.7. Focus groups lasted approximately 90 minutes and we re conducted using a semi-structured guide, with questions that included, but were not l imited to: perceptions of health issues in the community, access to resources that might promote h ealth (e.g., fresh fruit and vegetables, Bx App D - 6gyms), use of health services, access to medical an d behavioral health care, domestic violence, and recommendations for change. Follow-up questions were asked on ad hoc basis, based on responses heard. Focus groups were conducted by CE AR staff members and consultants retained by CEAR, each of whom was trained in the e stablished protocol. Many of the resident focus groups were co-facilitated by representatives of CBOs that were also trained on the focus group protocol. Focus groups in languages other tha n English and Spanish were conducted solely by trained community partners. Participants receiv ed a $25 honorarium, in appreciation of their time and insights. All focus groups were audio reco rded, so that transcriptions and/or detailed reports could be developed for each, and to allow f or verbatim quotations. DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS Surveys: Survey data were entered using Qualtrics, a web-based survey platform. They were analyzed according to standard statistical methods, using SAS. Means and proportions were generated, overall and by neighborhood. Although the survey sample cannot be considered representative of the Bronx in a statistical sense, and gaps are unavoidable, the combination of street and organizational outreach facilitated engagement of a targeted yet diverse population, including both individuals connected and unconnected to services. Survey respondents (N=622 individuals) came from all Bronx neighborhoods. Sociodemographic characteristics included: female, 54.6% foreign born, 11.3% limited English proficiency, 78.6% living below the poverty line, Table 1: Demographic characteristics of survey participants Characteristic (N=622) Age (Mean, or higher 77.7% Hispanic 35.1% Race White 9.3% Black or African American 54.6% Asian 10.6% American Indian or Alaskan Native 1.2% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander 0.5% Other/mixed/unknown 23.9% Limited English proficiency 11.3% Foreign born 39.2% Below poverty level 78.6% Health insurance 52.7% - 752.7% on Medicaid, 21.6% on Medicare, and 10.8% uni nsured. The mean age of respondents was 45.9, with a standard deviation of 17.9. (see a ppendix for survey results by neighborhood) Interviews and Focus Groups: Transcripts and focus group reports were maintained and analyzed in NVivo, a software package for qualitative resear ch. Data were coded according to pre- identified themes relevant to health, community nee ds, and DSRIP, as well as themes emerging from the data themselves (see Appendix for code lis t). Analysts utilized standard qualitative techniques, involving repeated reviews of the data and consultation between multiple members of the research team. Analyses focused on 1) commo n perceptions regarding issues, populations, recommendations, etc., 2) the unique knowledge and expertise of particular individuals or groups and 3) explanatory information that facilitated int erpretation of primary and secondary source data. FINDINGS IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT As noted above, key informants and focus group part icipants largely welcomed engagement in the community needs assessment and appreciated the opportunity to provide input that might be used for the re-engineering of health care in NYS. They were enthusiastic about the basic DSRIP aim of shifting health-related efforts from i npatient services to the community, where the focus can be on prevention and health maintenance. As described in some detail within this report, CNA participants had numerous ideas regardi ng health promotion, disease management, and improved health systems. However, a number of respondents expressed skepticism and concern that suggestions from the community\u2014and rec ommendations in the interest of community based organizations\u2014would be ignored by t he hospitals that are applying for DSRIP funds, in part because the DSRIP goals are seemingl y contrary to hospital financial interests and inconsistent with usual practice. The hospitals don't like doing things outside of th e hospitals... They always try to do it themselves and do it...acting as if they're going to incorporate the community, the nonprofit organizations, community-based organizati ons and so on. But they find any way possible to not include them and to do it withi n their own structure. They're challenged with having to change ... in a way that's going to hurt them [i.e., reducing readmissions and revenue], and then they're also to ld that they're forced to integrate the community and community providers and they're not u sed to doing that. So there's a lot of fanfare ... but in reality it it's not in their be st interest to do either one of the two things, integrate the community and community provi ders, community service providers, or to reduce their inpatient hospitalizations by 25 %. (key informant, multiservice organization) Bx App D - 8 Despite the disincentive, the importance of alignme nt with community-based recommendations and the need for solutions that address the social determinants of health were emphasized. For example: My greatest fear is that hospital will get the mone y from DSRIP and they will define what to do. As opposed to going outside the door, gettin g people and saying, \"Listen, what do you think that we could do to really minimize this problem\"... You really have to seriously listen to [community] and then they reall y have to be partners. You know, you just cannot use the community for something and the n discard. (key informant, CBO) We may not like every aspect of the waiver, but it is much better than past waivers. But there's still concerns, legitimate concerns that in clude how things are going to be done in terms of engaging communities. ... you can write it a ll in the document and say all you want, but we're talking about, historically, hospit als not knowing how to do it. (key informant, health advocacy) The [PPS's] really, I think, often naturally gravit ate towards the medical solutions. And what we try to say is, \"Yes, but without housing you 're never going to achieve that.\" And when you go talk to the frontline staff, whether th ey're in your emergency department, your social work department, your nurses, they're g oing to tell you that this guy needs housing. We were on a panel a while ago, and [a doc tor] opened by talking about how she had started a double shift on a Saturday mornin g, and discharged a guy who was homeless. He came into the emergency department ine briated, had fallen. They kind of fixed him up. She discharged him. That night he cam e back and had smashed his face and was inebriated. And as she was ordering the expensi ve tests to see if he had facial fractures, and the plastic surgeon, and everybody h ad come in, she knew that she would kind of repair this thing. But that he was just goi ng to be back. And until we got housing for him, she was just doing Band-Aids. (key informant, health advocacy) There were also concerns regarding the mismatch bet ween, on the one hand, an emphasis on prevention and community engagement, and on the oth er, clinical and utilization measures that may not reflect the highest priorities of the commu nity. For example, addressing obesity, particularly among children, is unlikely to impact hospitalizations and ER use in the short term. I think that's a real challenge, because when we're looking at things like DSRIP, we're looking at preventing hospitalizations ... Children w ho are obese don't get hospitalized. They get hospitalized and they use higher cost serv ices when they become adults but then all this money is gonna be gone. So you know, so n obody's looking at doing something Bx App D - 9that you need 15 years to have an impact on. Every body's looking at something that you can have an impact on today or tomorrow. (key informant, provider) POPULATION DESCRIPTION Communities of Color: The Bronx has the highest pr oportion of non-white residents in the city, with very significant numbers of Black/African Amer ican residents (including US-born and immigrant populations coming from Caribbean nations and increasingly from Africa), as well as Latinos. Among the borough's Latino population, Pue rto Ricans predominate, though an increasing number of immigrants are from the Domini can Republic and Central America. There is also a growing South and Southeast Asian populat ion, though small in comparison to other immigrant groups. Common immigrant-related themes from interviews with key informants and focus group discussions included some combination o f: Gaps in language access across the spectrum of serv ices; Difficulties meeting basic needs, leading to extend ed work hours and emotional stresses; Prioritization of work over health; Lack of sufficient information on health and health services; Minimal knowledge, interest, and engagement in prev ention services; Cultural issues, including greater stigmatization o f particular health conditions; Relatively high rates of non-insurance, due to mult iple factors including ineligibility; and Fear of medical bills, medical debt, and deportatio n. The concerns of other immigrant populations are mag nified among the undocumented. Access to most services is limited, and the fear of deport ation results in lower utilization of services that are available, including health services. Provider s report that people who are undocumented want to avoid providing information about themselve s, and avoid \"the system\" to the greatest extent possible. CNA participants were consistent in their reports o f very long work hours among multiple foreign born groups. Descriptions of 12 - 16 hours days, six or seven days a week were not uncommon, with people working multiple jobs (often under hazardous conditions) because pay is low. Such long work hours impact health and acce ss to health care services: The guy working 2 jobs, one in the morning, the oth er at night, he doesn't have time to take are of his health, and then it's too late. You don't have time for yourself. (focus group participant) Bx App D - 10Concerns about language access obviously suggest co ncrete requirements with respect to knowledge and skills. Although many CNA participan ts described significant capacity among some Bronx providers for Spanish, there were compla ints about use of telephonic services when a bilingual provider was not available. There was also some concern regarding training and skills of dual role interpreters (i.e., bilingual s taff who are asked to interpret on an ad hoc basis), as well as gaps in services for groups newer to the Bronx, including Africans, South Asians, and Southeast Asians. So we have heard of [Asian] folks that are living u p in the Bronx, perhaps because that's where they got placed in NYCHA housing, but all of their services are in Brooklyn. So they go to the grocery in Brooklyn. Their friends a re there. Their doctors are there. So that's a tremendous amount of time to be able to tr avel to get culturally-competent, language-accessible programs and services. So then that's a real big challenge that we're seeing across a lot of communities, in the As ian-American community (key informant CBO) Independent of work and language access issues, key informants and focus group participants described cultural, attitudinal, perceptual and kno wledge-based barriers to care among the foreign born, including greater stigmatization of p articular health conditions (including HIV and mental health issues), difficulties navigating the health insurance and care system, low prioritization of preventive care services, and fea r of medical bills and deportation. It's a cultural issue. Where we come from greatly i mpacts our behaviors, and it's clear, in Africa, health is not a priority. It's a fact. The fact that health isn't a priority and the financial difficulties, they go together, this comb ination is devastating for us. I have a certain level of education, but I swear, as long as I'm not caput, I won't go to the hospital. (focus group participant) Poverty: Given the DSRIP and CNA focus on low-incom e populations, the significance of poverty and its implications is unsurprising. John Jones who lives in the South Bronx goes to wor k and is breaking his neck trying to earn a living. He's not going to worry about being screened. (focus group participant) However, poverty in the Bronx was unquestionably mo re pervasive and seen as more intractable as compared to other parts of New York City (NYC)\u2014a nd its consequences for health and well- being more pronounced. I think it's less about [health care] access and mor e about all of the other things that are hindering access: poverty, chaotic drug use, unstab le housing, hunger. So that's why we Bx App D - 11spent so much time attacking those issues, so they can get stabilized, so then they can think about medical care. So, I think what's lacki ng is more commitment of resources to really addressing homelessness and hunger and those things that once they're stabilized, access becomes much, much easier. (key informant, C BO) There could be as many as 17 people living [in a tw o bedroom apartment]. I mean, literally three bunk beds in the living room, two b unks in - you know, in each bedroom, you know. And people working and living in shifts, people working at day where people who can work at night can sleep. It's just unreal. And the reality of what's happening throughout the Bronx. (key informant, CBO) It's just stunning to me the amount of hunger. We call our congregate food program an emergency food program, but the fact is even with f ood stamps, we've still got a lot of people coming to the program because food stamps ar en't enough. (key informant, community based organization) Multiple key informants cited the County Health Ran kings, with the Bronx again ranking 62 out of 62 NYS counties. The Bronx Health County rankings came out again a w eek or two ago, and that's what I brought up is we were 62 out of 62 again. (key informant, CBO) Of survey respondents in the Bronx, 78.6% were livi ng below the federal poverty line; in the South Bronx neighborhoods of Hunts Point-Mott Haven , High Bridge-Morrisania, and Crotona- Tremont, respondents 85.9 %, and 79.2, respectively. Borough-wide, 19.1% of respondents reported that they were unempl oyed; the comparable figures from respondents from the South Bronx were 17.0% in Hunt s Point-Mott Haven, 30.3% in High Bridge-Morrisania, and 23.1% in Crotona-Tremont. Si xty-four percent (64.0%) of all respondents stated that they worried about not havi ng enough to eat, with the percentage in Crotona-Tremont reaching 70.0% and in High Bridge-M orrisania, 66.4%. Community members and key informants clearly connec ted common health conditions to the causes and repercussions of poverty, including inco me insecurity, lack of jobs, insufficient or hazardous housing, and unhealthy neighborhoods. The y also associated poverty\u2014and its diminished life chances and daily struggles\u2014 with d epression, and likewise depression with substance abuse (including\u2014and in some cases, espec ially\u2014alcohol and tobacco). CNA participants reported concerns about jobs, housing, access to government benefits programs, and the safety of their streets. Particularly in the So uth Bronx, school quality is reported to be poor and dropout rates are high, impacting future opport unities for individuals as well as the strength of the community. Bx App D - 12 There are areas of the South Bronx where 7% of the adults have a college degree. That means 93 percent of adults do not have a college de gree. That is like a staggering educational segregation. You know, I don't remembe r off the top of my head what Manhattan is like, but it's like 40 or 50 percent o f adults have a college degree. So, the young people who are growing up in these areas, the odds that they meet a grown-up from their neighborhood who has a college degree is exceedingly low... If you're talking about young men in the South Bronx, I don't have th e data exactly current\u2014but it's got to be less than 50 percent [graduate from high school] . So that means the high schools are mostly creating dropouts and not successful high sc hool graduates, and that has a huge health impact and the long-term employment impact a nd all of those things...You know, the school system can try as hard as it can, but it 's very ill-equipped to deal with and under-resourced to deal with all the myriad of issu es that young people present in high school . (key informant, government) A dramatic indicator of poverty with obvious health implications is food insecurity, which was described as a challenge by multiple respondents in focus groups and interviews and\u2014as mentioned above\u2014by 64.0% of respondents in the boro ugh-wide survey. Focus group participants and key informants described the trade -offs made in the interest of food security. It's cheaper to eat rice and chicken. So finances have a lot to say also with food choices, because if you have a large family and you want, yo u know, the food to go longer or further with the number of people in the household, what is it you're buying? Is it more expensive to buy oranges, grapes, strawberries and w atermelon than it is to have other items that may not be as nutritious? (Key informant, community based organization) I would say that poverty is the main concern becaus e people are finding it - number one, they're unemployed or they're underemployed or they 're working places where they cannot get health insurance and now with the new la w, they must have health insurance. So they - like I said, if - when people have to dec ide between having health insurance and having food in their stomach, they'd rather eat (key informant, CBO) Environmental Conditions: Residents and service pro viders in the Bronx describe numerous environmental challenges, including: Outdoor environmental toxins coming from multiple c ongested highways, as well as facilities for waste transfer, waste processing, an d power generation Indoor environmental toxins, such as pest infestati on and mold, resulting from poor maintenance in public and other low income housing Food \"deserts\" (lack of healthy food) and food \"swa mps\" (excess of unhealthy food) Bx App D - 13 Challenging social conditions resulting from concen trated poverty and a seemingly disproportionate placement of particular services ( e.g., homeless shelters, methadone clinics) in particular neighborhoods, resulting in perceived declines in safety and quality of life for community members Lack of affordable housing Among survey participants, close to half (47.5%) i dentified affordable housing as \"not very available\" or \"not available at all.\" Housing, and other environmental conditions\u2014though in many ways dramatically improved compared to decades when the Bronx was best known for arson, violent crime and drugs\u2014are seen to reflect decades of neglect by government, service providers, and landlords. Focus group participants and key informants are concerned that the area remains neglected, and that opportunities for change go nowhere: We won a million dollars for our housing authority to upgrade our parks for the children. This was last year. They won the money but went bac k to another meeting and I asked them well, \"Where did the money go? We won the mon ey; you came here, and you told us that we won the money. Where is it? And what's going to happen?\" We had some very damaged sidewalks in our community. (focus group participant) We try. We try to put new buildings, new everythin g in the community, but there's always somebody trying to drag it back down, so it's hard... The crime, the drugs... We try to fix it, and there's always something bad happening. We get no service, police, or whatever it is. We are ignored. Even health issues in that co mmunity, like I said, in that community, I know about 50 people that have cancer; don't smok e, don't do none of that. But they have cancer, and it's the community, because we're surrounded by the garbage, okay. We're surrounded by Con Edison. (focus group participant) Housing big, big need. You have individuals that a re complaining that landlords are converting their buildings into shelter-like settin gs and offering tenants that have been there for several years $5,000, $6,000 to move out so that they can convert that building and secure city funding and reimbursement for that type of client profile or tenant profile (key informant, CBO) However, the legacy of activism in the Bronx, parti cularly around housing, was described as a strength of community: The South Bronx has a pretty vibrant history of hav ing pushed back against the bad mortgage practices and done a lot of community orga nizing around unfair practices and pushing for affordable housing. And I don't think the affordable housing situation is solved, but it's a lot better than it was, and ther e's a lot more attention put into Bx App D - 14affordable housing. So that's like a rich recent h istory that I think a lot of community- based organizations were forged during that time pe riod, and then they came to take on health because that's sort of, you know, housing, h ealth education, as far as kind of primitive needs that we all want. (key informant, government) PHYSICAL HEALTH ISSUES Overview: The five most common physical health conc erns reported by survey respondents were diabetes (53.6%), drug and alcohol abuse (47.2%), h igh blood pressure (39.8%), asthma (38.5%), and obesity (34.5%). When asked about the health ed ucation needs of the community, the top issues were diabetes (51.5%), nutrition (43.3%), HIV and sexually transmitted infections (40.0%), and exercise and physical activity (38.2%). Cancer and cancer prevention tied with substance abuse (both 36.3%). As one service provider in the community commented: You know, it's sad to see ... the health conditions of the individuals that I'm seeing in the Bronx. I'm looking at obesity, I'm looking at smoking, I'm looking at and hearing as well of diabetes, hypertension. You know, we have a senior population that's also in poverty mode as well, so that's a challenge. (key informant, health provider) Diabetes, Nutrition and Physical Activity: Overall, a little over half (56.7%) of survey respondents reported that healthy foods were available or very available in their community, and comparison across Bronx neighborhoods demonstrated the disparities between neighborhoods (see appendix for neighborhood breakout). Community members and key informants draw clear linkages between diabetes, obesity, lack of exercis e, and food access. They noted the relatively high cost of healthy food choices and the travel re quired to purchase fresh fruit and vegetables. They also described the challenges of changing diet ary behavior in general\u2014and of losing Table 2: Health concerns (N=621) Adolescent health 10.0% Asthma 38.5% Arrest and incarcertation 17.7% Cancer 31.7% Diabetes Disability Drug abuse 47.2% Family planning/birth control 12.2% Hepatitis 7.4% Heart disease 22.4% High blood pressure 39.8% HIV 25.8% Maternal and child health 7.3% Mental health (e.g. depressin, suicide) 19.5% Obesity 34.5% Pollution (e.g. air quality, garbage) 11.0% Sexual transmitted infections 17.7% Stroke 12.1% Teen pregnancy 20.8% Tobacco use 17.9% Violence or injury 17.1% Other 4.7% Bx App D - 15weight, in particular\u2014despite obvious negative heal th consequences. Cultural preferences for fried and certain high caloric foods were acknowled ged. The biggest issue we confront is obesity and diabet es. Again, that's a function of what I just spoke about - people not getting out, kids not playing in the street, so a lack of physical activity, lack of safe places for people t o interact and be together and add to that the lack of access to healthy food. That is a bad combination to try to make improvements in obesity rates and diabetes. (key informant, FQHC) The South Bronx: number one, it's a healthy food de sert. I think it's getting better because of concerted efforts by a lot of people, bu sinesses and funders and City Harvest and Food Bank have done remarkable work on that. Bu t I think for the most part, if you walked into a bodega you wouldn't find a piece of f ruit or a vegetable, and if you did, it would be like a plantain. Everything is canned. W e've got people who are obese who are starving because they're eating empty calories. Chips and fried chicken and fried this and fried that. And so I think that's diet and a sedentary lifestyle and lack of access to fresh foods is a huge driver of the poor health of the Bronx, and the South Bronx in particular. (key informant, community based organization) My son lives with me, and he will go on a diet and eat vegetables and a bit of meat. But my husband, who's the fattest in the household does n't let us because he's insatiable. He can spend all day in the kitchen. He doesn't like g oing on a diet because he doesn't understand why he should go hungry. We've tried but then he goes out and buys himself something. (focus group participant) You're selling stuff on the street there from seven o'clock to seven o'clock at night. You can't take a two hour break because you're gonna lo se a client. Right? So then all that time you don't seem to eat anything, because you do n't want to miss a dollar. You've got a bill to pay. You have to work six days in a week to get maybe less than $300.00. If you don't come to work, you don't get paid that day .... So then when you finish at night not only are you exhausted physically and mentally, but you need to eat. And guess what we do. We walk into the restaurant and get a whole pl ate of food. (focus group participant) Access to healthy foods differed according to neigh borhood, with apparently better access in particular northern Bronx communities. Relatively, in [Pelham Parkway], we have very good stores with plentiful vegetables or fruits. But we live in a donut. We're in the eye of that storm. Around us, we have other communities that are virtually food deserts. (focus group participant) Bx App D - 16I find myself going to Whole Foods a lot. So the mi lk you are talking about, you can get it for like a gallon or half a gallon, you can get it for like $5.49 when you pay for one. But I got to go out the area for it. But you pay car far e to go there. It's not like I can walk to the corner store and get it, or go to my local supe rmarkets and get it. (focus group participant) Some providers and community members perceive a sen se of resignation to the convergence of circumstances and conditions that produce dispropor tionately poor health outcomes in the Bronx. In the Bronx, so many people have diabetes. The So uth Bronx has the highest rate for amputations as a direct result of diabetes. So a lo t of people just think of it as a chronic disease and like everybody's living with diabetes. So they're not afraid of it, you know. They kinda think, \"My grandmother had it and my mot her had it, so I'll get it too at some point.\" (key informant, CBO) However, the behavioral implications of living in p overty were clear to focus group participants and to key informants that worked closely with community members and there was frustration that many health care providers appeared to lack a similar level of understanding. I had with a father who was there with this 12-year-old son who was already showing signs of pre-diabetes and he just, he looked at me and he says, you, there is no way you are ever going to understand my life. I said you're absolutely right. I can hear what you're telling me but I don't understand how hard it is for you to have food in your house and how hard it is for you to get your child to eat the right things and exercise which is the only way that's gonna prevent him from getting diabetes as this point. But I think that what he expressed is his frustration that the general medical community could not understand the problems of peop le living in poverty when their children have health problems. (key informant, provider) Table 3: Health Status (N=622) Perceived health status Excellent/very good/good 73.7% Fair/Poor Normal 30.5% Overweight Asthma 20.4% Cancer 6.3% Chronic pain 19.9% Depression or anxiety 21.5% Diabetes 16.0% Drug or alcohol abuse 9.1% Heart disease 9.4% Hepatitis C 4.0% High blood pressure 27.3% High cholesterol 19.3% HIV 4.3% Mobility impairment 7.6% Osteoporosis 7.1% Bx App D - 17 Asthma: Key informants and focus group participants attribute high rates of asthma in the South Bronx to environmental conditions. These include c ongested truck traffic on multiple highways and private and public facilities that spew toxic c hemicals into the air. Apartment buildings with low-income tenants tend to be poorly maintained and are frequently infested with insects, rodents, and mold. CNA participants recognized tha t melioration of poor environmental conditions cannot be the responsibility of individu als; rather systems and policy change are required. It's very mind-boggling the statistics on asthma in the Bronx. And, it's mainly related to the built environment ... we call it the asthma all ey because if you know the city well, you know, 87 Highway, you have the Cross Bronx, then yo u have 95, so there's a triangle in the South Bronx, and the number of trucks... the traf fic 24/7 is jam-packed. And the inner roads, all the pollution, particulate matter, you k now, all those things fairly contribute a lot. And, of course, with the environment of the ho using units, you have the mold and the cockroaches, and rodents... We give care to people who come in walking through the door, we don't even do a history of them first. We just treat them in the asthma room, and then we discharge them ... They go back home and they have the same triggers and they get worse. (key informant, provider). People who live in the Bronx are concerned about th e amount of trucks, because of all the highways we have and particularly around the Hu nts Point area where trucks are idled over there a lot because of dropping off or p icking up stuff. And asthma is extremely high. The Bronx has one of the highest asthma rates in New York. And, so they're concerned about the environment, the pollution that 's going around ... some of the housing ... is riddled with roaches, you know, and mi ce and they're concerned because, again, roaches also affect people's asthma. (key informant, CBO). In my neighborhood they have a lot of chemical inci nerators. .... We had to do a petition to get rid of the hazardous waste on Bruckner Boule vard, because when they was incinerating needles and surgical stuff, all sorts of hazardous stuff they were burning in our area, and it caused a lot of people to have ast hma. So we had to get a petition. (focus group participant) [Asthma] is a health indicator that needs to be cha nged, right? And the community will tell you that, but then you need to bring in govern ment. It's not enough to have health partners and the community. But if we are serious ab out impacting the health outcomes of communities, why couldn't we bring government in , you know to say, \"Are there things that can be done with moving the roads or whatever? \" Anyway, what I'm just saying is Bx App D - 18that the onus cannot just be put on community. Gove rnment has a role, a role to play in these things, too. (key informant, multiservice organization) HIV: HIV was not among the highest concerns of the survey respondents (25.8% listed HIV). However, 40.0% of respondents stated that more heal th education is needed on HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. According to key i nformants in the field, transmission of HIV among injecting drug users in the Bronx has dro pped dramatically, although hepatitis C remains a concern, since it is more easily transmit ted. In '95 ... the new infection rate among injection dru g users was 54%, so literally one out of every two people had HIV or AIDS. Now it's unde r 4%. We've got very few new infections. We have a lot - we see a prevalence ar ound hepatitis C, because it's so much more communicable, with the cotton and other stuff. (key informant, CBO) There was a recognition among those in the HIV serv ice world (as providers or consumers) that funding has shifted away from HIV care, that medica l management\u2014rather than addressing psychosocial issues\u2014is considered paramount, and th at HIV is increasingly seen as a manageable chronic condition. There was variabilit y in attitudes regarding this shift. We still have the state ADAP program that covers im migrants, the undocumented and uninsured. So the system of care for HIV is well-bui lt. What's peeling away are some of the supportive services that keep people in care o r bring them to care in the first place. I think substance use treatment services and mental h ealth services have blossomed finally.... Community-based programs that used to pr ovide supportive services for HIV ... have been pared down, and there's more of a funde r focus on medical [unclear] HIV care, putting more funding in the hospital setting for case management, HIV case management. (key informant, CBO) I've noticed that a lot of HIV has become a control led infection, and they don't look at it as serious as it was. We are losing a lot of fundin g and we're losing a lot of our specialty clinics that were there to help specifically people that are HIV. Now their clinics have opened up to the general public, and we've lost a l ot of that, which I think is disgusting. Even though HIV has become a manageable disease, it is still as serious as it was in the '80s. (Focus group participant) I could click off six organizations that probably s houldn't even exist right now, because they're more concerned with their funding than abou t really meeting the needs of who they're serving. They're giving away a syringe whi le people's toes are falling off from diabetes and not asking about the diabetes.... That w as the shift. That was the light bulb for me. We were doing syringe exchange and [not] w orrying about people's diabetes or Bx App D - 19psychiatric conditions and that's what they were dy ing from. It's immoral, it's wrong to just focus on one thing, because that's what you're funded to do . (key informant, CBO) Violence: Only 17.1% of survey respondents rated vi olence as significant health concern, and publicly available data suggest that crime has decl ined in the Bronx, as it has declined in other parts of NYC. However, 30.7% of respondents indicat ed that more education was needed on violence and 35.8% reported that education was need ed on domestic violence. Focus group participants and key informants described violence as prevalent in particular neighborhoods and in public housing, with repercussions for those dir ectly and directly involved. Domestic violence was also alluded to and was linked to the stresses of poverty and drug use. There's a high portion of youth against youth. It's turf issues. It's, \"I live over here and you live over there,\" or whatever it is...even though older people are not targeted, they're definitely impacted by the safety that they feel about the community. (Key informant, CBO) The amount of gun violence that's gone on and the a mount of people and kids that are shot just by stray bullets or intentional bullets ... It's related to drugs, but it's also just related to gang violence, in general, you know... B ut the guns, the amount of guns that are just so accessible to our community is alarming . (Key informant, CBO) I think safety is a big component that sometimes pe ople don't think about with social determinants. Safety from violence, that your kids are going to be okay, that you can go to the park and you are going to be safe and that y our kids are going to be okay playing outside. ... When I grew up in the Bronx, I was just let out into the street and I played. I don't think that happens in too many places, not ju st in the Bronx, but also all over. (Key informant, FQHC) Concentrated poverty, you've got a neighborhood [i n the South Bronx that] has a poverty rate of about 46%. The Bronx in general is about 26%, which is still ridiculous, but that area has that concentrated poverty because of all the NYCHA housing projects. And so when you get that kind of concentrated pover ty and then the violence, sexual violence, domestic violence, street violence, gang violence, drug violence, it's a perfect storm for breeding ground for spreading illness, di sease, lots of psychiatric issues and lots of drugs. (Key informant, CBO) Although not necessarily more prevalent, domestic v iolence issues were particularly relevant in immigrant communities, due to possibly different st andards in their home country as compared to the US, stigma, lack of linguistically and cultu rally appropriate resources, and fear of deportation\u2014particularly in mixed immigration statu s families. Immigrant groups coming from Bx App D - 20war-torn countries may also perpetuate the violence they experienced. Focusing on immigrants from Southeast Asia, a key informant explained: There are these young men in his community that the image that they have always seen when they were growing up was the way that their fa thers would treat their mothers, right? And then they realized later on when they we re kind of able to unpack it and get treatment was really, when you come from communitie s who have been just so devastated by war and by trauma, that what was happening to the fathers and their uncles is that a lot of times they didn't get treatment. They were t otally traumatized, and they were taking it out on the mothers. So that's how - so these youn g men were growing up thinking, well, that's how you treat women . (key informant, CBO) BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES Mental Health: Depression, anxiety, and other menta l health issues are important to large parts of the community in the Bronx: 19.5% of survey respond ents rated mental health as an area of concern, 21.5% reported depression or anxiety as is sues they have personally faced, and 32.4% reported that mental health education is needed in the borough. Just 53.3% of respondents reported that the mental health services are \"avail able\" or \"very available\" in their community. Problems related to mental health were commonly att ributed to the myriad of stresses faced by lower income residents. What we see is depression, anxiety, some personalit y adjustment disorders. Those kinds of diagnoses that are part of the environment as we ll. People are smart, and they look around at their surroundings- what is there to hope for? (Key informant, FQHC) We have extremes of problems, mental health is an i ssue because of the complex environment they live in, the poor support. So we s ee a lot of depression, a lot of anxiety, and that leads to an impact on their own health. Ad herence to medications, adherence to follow-up, you know, family getting separated becau se of that. ... that's a problem in terms of - it goes across all demographics... There's no political motivation to address an issue. It's sort of like an accepted norm for the c ommunity. \"Oh, Bronx, you know, it should have these elements.\" I feel that way after seeing this for many years. Because if we can address many other issues so, so aggressivel y, why is this not being addressed, I'm not so sure. So the mental health, drug use com plicates medical health, medical issues a lot. A lot. (Key informant, provider) For low-income immigrants, stresses were exacerbate d by issues of assimilation, as well as poorer access to care, due to insurance and languag e barriers. Bx App D - 21You've got to be somebody, somebody who [was] a doc tor or military for years. You come into this country and become a cashier. If yo u are not mentally prepared for this, this is not really a culture shock. But this is a big shock ...But sometime people don't want to talk about it. People are keeping this to themselves, but at some point you'll see they'll start talking by themselves, and start doin g some things. (immigrant focus group participant) Failure to address mental health issues was common across groups, with broad health implications. Men, in general, shun medical attention - be it men tal or physical. We're not examining ourselves as much. We're not seeking help to talk to a peer. When we're depressed, we internalize. When we're angry, we express ourselve s and that transforms into violence. (Focus group participant) Like counseling for a lot of people in this communi ty because we have a lot of broken families, which is single mothers, and single fathe rs, too. And that's why a lot of our youth have the tendency to don't continue in school , and get into drugs. And also men, you know, and women are getting into drugs. So I t hink that we should have more services - programs, services that they could allot for counseling regarding help about how to deal with divorce, how to deal with a parent leaving, things like that. (focus group participant) Substance abuse (including tobacco, alcohol, and il licit drugs): Substance abuse was the second most commonly cited health concern by survey respon dents (47.2%); many (36.2%) also noted the need for education on the topic. As noted throu ghout this report, substance abuse was linked to many other issues related to health and well-bei ng, including depression, violence, domestic violence, infectious disease, and inappropriate use of health care services. There is high substance use. You know, heroin has c ome back to the Bronx very strong. Crack and cocaine never left the Bronx. It's still here. Marijuana is, you know, everywhere... I think it's probably more and more due to poverty than anything else. Poor people, you know, are so stressed out with just hav ing a roof over their heads, having food on their plates, being able to get their child in school. And, you know, there's just so many challenges for people - for poor people to hav e to deal with. People being homeless. The domestic violence is just unbelievabl e... Many people, you know, use substances so they cannot face the reality of their lives. So they smoke crack or take heroin because it's easier not to feel the reality. (Key informant, CBO) Bx App D - 22Obviously drug abuse is still a big problem. Alcoho lism is a huge problem, and we see a lot of admissions, a lot of patients with some sort of drug abuse or alcohol misuse (key informant, provider) CNA participants recognized the relationship betwee n community characteristics and substance use issues, citing both the presence of drug treatm ent programs that draw active users and commercial establishments that sell alcohol and cig arettes. That building on 147th at the end of the Betances N orth, there's like three methadone clinics around there. And we did hear a lot from th e residents that that was a big concern. (key informant, CBO) I think our businesses in our communities play an i mportant role. We can impact what they do or not. Outside the mouth of Co-op City, th ere's a Sunoco gas station. In big letters the advertisement is \"lotto, beer, cigars.\" Big signs to get\u2014that's a negative impact on the community. And it's not about cigars. They know that these young folk use the cigar wrappings to wrap marijuana. (focus group participant) Focus group respondents also indicated that substan ce abuse can affect diverse populations. Individuals who rely on prescription medicines were described as facing increasing risk of addiction. We're also hearing about the increase of prescriptio n abuse with the seniors, and, you know, people are living longer and, with that said, you have a lot of chronic diseases, not a lot of pain management. So that's also another co ncern that we want to be able to try and address and that's why I would love to have a s ubstance abuse program in order to meet those needs of the seniors that are experienci ng that, let alone the stigma associated with that as well ... (Focus group participant) ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND SERVICES Medical Services: Almost 76% of survey respondents reported that primary care was available or very available, 81.8%% reported that they had a pri mary care provider or personal doctor, and 85.5% reported that there is a place they \"usually for health care, when it is not an emergency.\" Just under half of respondents (49.5%) went to a pr imary care doctor's office, 18.0% went to a hospital outpatient clinic, 14.3% went to a communi ty/family health center, and 6.4% went to a specialist doctor's office. The overwhelming major ity (85.5%) percent reported that the place they usually go is in the Bronx; 11.2% reported tha t it is Manhattan. Eighty-one percent reported that had a routine check-up in the last 12 months. Bx App D - 23 A relatively high number of respondents (45.7%) repo rted that they had been to an emergency room in the last year, and approximately one quarte r (24.7%) of reported that they did not obtain healthcare when it was needed. Of these, 44.6% repo rted that they were not insured, 22.1% that the cost of co-pays was too high, 11.0% that they c ould not get a timely appointment. 8.4% were concerned with the quality of care, and 6.5% did no t have transportation and had other responsibilities (same proportion for each). Independent of the actual number of health care res ources described in the sections below, a strong theme that emerged from the key informant in terviews and focus groups was the perception that there was an insufficient access to the high quality providers on a timely basis, including outside of regular office hours (i.e., ni ghts and weekends). A key informant working in the South Bronx explained: Because it's the Bronx. You know how hard it is t o get [organizations] to come up here to do anything? And generally they don't get provi ders... The services in a lot of the outer boroughs are not at the level of quality that they should be. I'm saying that as a Bronx-based provider. (key informant, community based organization) Community members also complained about poor access to what they perceived as quality care: When you go to a hospital for an emergency they give you a form to fill out. You sit down, and an hour later they call you. And they give you an appointment for three months to now. Three months to now, you could be dead. And when you go in three months, some of them spend 5 minutes with you. Some of them even have the nerve to have a clock. And you're not feeling well. And t hen you have to fill out a long sheet about why you're here. So I don't bother to go. I g et my herbs. Holistic doctors is what I believe in because these doctors know nothing ... The y don't care nothing about you. Everything is money. If I can help it I don't even bother going. (focus group participant) The doctor I have, she has on my thing, 15 minutes. She knows she can't tell me something in five minutes. Fifteen minutes and she h as to examine me. I go and I open my Table 4: Service availability (N=622) Accessible transportation 90.0% Affordable housing 47.5% Dental services 71.5% Healthy food 56.7% Home health care 62.0% Job training 34.3% Medical specialists 59.3% Mental health services 53.3% Pediatric and adolescent services 64.5% Places to exercise, walk, and play 70.6% Primary care medicine 75.8% Social services 63.5% Substance abuse services 51.9% Vision services 65.8% *Percentage reflects participants who responded very available or available Bx App D - 24mouth for them because that's all they're doing. Th ey think I'm crazy. (focus group participant) Approximately sixty percent reported that medical s pecialists are available/very available, although there was significant variability in respo nses according to neighborhood (e.g., 53% in Hunts Point-Mott Haven as opposed to 72% in the Nor theast Bronx). Several key informants and focus groups participants reported on relatively po or access to specialist services. There's still a ton of people in the community that we've served that have chronic illnesses that are the result of a whole bunch of d ifferent factors that primary and preventative care are just not going to be able to address. And so there's a gap in primary care providers' ability to find specialists who are accepting Medicaid or different kinds of insurance. (key informant, health advocacy) Sometimes now they're having programs for like youn ger kids that are not using it and sometimes you know, you might be older, needing of help, but you can't get it because there isn't a lot of help for the older. (focus group participant) Behavioral Health Services: Survey respondents repo rted that behavioral health services are less available than other types of care: only 53.3% repo rted that mental health services were available/very available; 51.9% of Bronx survey res pondents reported substance abuse services as available or very available. Barriers to behavio ral health services include low reimbursement and provider shortages, including outside regular b usiness hours. The way reimbursement is being structured, it's str aining programs and there are many programs right now that are trying to survive withi n the new payment structure. So there is a concern that, you know, they could do more, bu t because of constrictions within their budget, they're limited in the number of visits and services that they're able to provide, even on extended hours. And then when you look at, you know, who can truly benefit, right, from mental health services, you also have a working population, and if you're not open later in the evening or on the weekends, then that excludes another group. By the same token, I've been involved with another mental health clinic and the staff expressed grave concerns regarding extended hours during the winter because it gets dark so early and safety. (key informant, CBO) According to some providers, services that are avai lable might also be unknown to community organizations and residents\u2014or they might be unawar e of processes for accessing them. In addition, behavioral health issues generally carry greater stigma than other health concerns, which tends to limit use of services. Key informan ts and focus group participants both reported Bx App D - 25that many affected individuals and families try to address problems internally\u2014or not at all. A key informant emphasized the disparities in percept ions of behavioral health across NYC. In New York if you're white having a therapist is a badge of honor, if you're black it's stigmatized. (key informant, CBO) When you grew up without this and you're a certain age, it's hard to accept getting the help. So I think that's part of the problem also. S o even if it's open to you, if you weren't brought up to believe that you can go to someone el se for help or therapy, it was never a part of our culture. (focus group participant) According to key informants that are themselves pro viders, regulatory issues promote fragmentation of services. Depending upon the level of what people talk about, behavioral health can be done within the Article 28. We have psychiatrists who w ork within the [article] 28 and psychiatry can be in health clinics. They're really there to really confirm and confer. It's called a consultation liaison model and you know, y ou're really, the rule of thumb and it's hard to get answers out of Medicaid about how many times we can be seen. It's like a maximum of three times. So if someone needs more t han just a simple SSRI, you know, you see the psychiatrist. The psychiatrist may say you know what, I really think you should go into [article] 31 ... It's not that it's a bad thing, you know but it's just another step ... We do offer short term therapy in our 28 whi ch does not make you go through that. We have very limited slots and because of li censure, it has to be secondary to a medical issue because again, the Medicaid rules are very clear. (key informant, CBO) A number of providers suggested that there is even poorer integration within behavioral health services themselves than between physical and behav ioral health. Behavioral health services are reported to be highly regulated by multiple agencie s: Office for People with Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD), Office for Alcoholism and Sub stance Abuse Services (OASAS), and Office of Mental Health (OMH) with patient care bei ng restricted according to the funding and regulatory agency\u2014despite the frequency of co-occur ring disorders. Thus, a mental health provider might be limited in the severity of illnes s that can be treated, the age of the patient, and other factors. Historically, your systems like OMH and OASAS, up u ntil very recently, they really worked in silos. So, if you came into a mental hea lth clinic and in your intake appointment, you said, \"You know, I smoke pot a cou ple times a week,\" a red flag would go up. You talk to your supervisor and they say, \" They have to go to substance abuse.\" So until those doors really become integrated, I me an really become integrated in Bx App D - 26treatment and acceptance and a model of care, we're going to continue to run into these types of challenges because it's very fragmented. (key informant, multiservice organization) Dental Care: Seventy-two percent of survey responde nts felt that dental services are available or very available in their community: My center facility has the WIC program and dentists and the doctors there will always refer you to specialists. (key informant, CBO) I don't have dental insurance. I could be a little better with my dental health. I need dental work. I can't afford it. I've had a good ex perience with dental care at Jacobi. Thumbs up for Jacobi dental care, which is more acc essible than lots of dental care. (focus group participant) However, just 58% reported having been to the denti st in the prior 12 months. A common barrier to dental care was cost: When a focus facilitator a sked, \"What about dental care\u2014do people go to the dentist each year?\" responses included: Nope. I don't. I don't need to, unless I break something. (Laughs - has dentures) These co-pays are ridiculous. I pay $40 every time. I pay $40, and I pay $190-something a month for the coverage. Too expensive. Just for a cleaning. Insurance: Focus group participants, in response to a question regarding what should change in health care, commonly cited insurance, including it s expense, complications, and the limitations it places on choice. Limitations on choice were pa rticularly problematic for individuals with special needs, including individuals with disabilit ies and limited English proficient individuals. A key informant explained: So if you signed up for a plan and that doctor that takes care of your community isn't on that plan then there's not a whole lot you can do. And the other issue is you might be signed up for a provider who says he accepts this p lan and then halfway through the year you're locked into the plan, [even] if the provider drops it...They do not have any commitment and so that's been - there's no accounta bility on the provider side in terms of staying in it. And this is particularly importa nt for immigrants ... when you talk about languages of lesser infusion, where there are not t hat many providers that speak those Bx App D - 27languages or have the cultural competence. (key informant, health advocacy) Lack of insurance was, not surprisingly, a more com mon problem in immigrant communities, due to limitations on immigrant eligibility for pub lic insurance programs, as well as more limited access to employer-sponsored care (due to restricte d job opportunities). However, community members and key informants also report that income restrictions for Medicaid are unrealistically low, and self-purchased coverage is felt to be too expensive for low- income populations, given the difficulties of paying for basic necessities li ke food and housing in NYC. Many low-income, previously uninsured, community members had been re ceiving free or very low cost services at FQHC's or HHC facilities; insurance is perceived to be expensive in comparison. Sometimes [they] simply can't afford them 'cause not everybody's eligible for Medicaid, you know. And then there is this group of individua ls that fall in between Medicaid and private health insurance. Unfortunately, that group is much larger than any of us would like to see. (Key informant, CBO) Lack of insurance coverage resulted in neglect of p rimary care, preventive services, and dentistry; limited access to prescription medicatio ns; and use of emergency care for non-urgent issues. For example: I have hypertension and when I moved here from the D R [Dominican Republic] I didn't have insurance, and so I had to ask people to bring my hypertension pills from the Dominican Republic. One time, there wasn't anyone c oming and so I ran out and I felt terrible. My daughter's father didn't want to take me to the doctor because he didn't want to pay, so I had to drink some water with suga r and salt and wait it out. He didn't bring me to the doctor for fear of the bill. Now I have health insurance and I get my pills here. (community member, focus group participant) So, Medicaid, if you look at Medicaid, it's a compl ete inverse of private insurance, lots of kids, almost no adults, lots of old people, all dis abled people. Private insurance, not a lot of kids, lots of working adults, all these other fo lks. So, you get all these uninsured people, they get hit by a bus, they get AIDS, they get cancer, their addiction goes untreated, they immediately fall into Medicaid beca use they don't have insurance that's sustaining them and then they end up in one of the more catastrophic levels of Medicaid because Medicaid differentiates patients based on t heir needs based on their diagnosis and the DSRIP as much about that. (Key informant, CBO provider) Supportive Services: For populations that have diff iculty accessing health care services, whether because of unfamiliarity with the system, age, lang uage, or other factors, supportive services, including transit, health education, navigation, ca se management, can make a critical difference. Bx App D - 28There was a concern that medical providers have ins ufficient information regarding supportive services and the benefits they offer. A hospital b ased physician commented: Because physicians like us, we have absolutely zero knowledge of community resources, and there are plenty of community resources. (key i nformant, health provider) Community Health Workers: Several CNA participants described the significance of community health workers (CHWs), and the multiple roles they played (or could play) in promoting health and appropriate health care use, particularly with respect to complicated components of the health care system, including health insurance and hospitals. From the perspective of CNA participants, training and employment of CHWs not o nly benefited patients and clients but also provided important training and employment opportun ities for community members. A great model is the community health worker model. This cooperative idea is training, hiring people from the community to improve people' s health. Who's better than someone who's next to you? And maybe not always, because of privacy and other issues. But if he looks like you, and he has family who comes from [t he same place], they get trained in a way to do it. It would be great to have more commun ity health workers around everywhere. (key informant, health advocacy) There's some work to be done on the pre, coming int o the hospital ... making sure that all the doctors have been pre-certified and pre-cleared , making sure that people did or did not drink or understood exactly all the instruction s they needed to follow before coming into the hospital. Making sure that they know wher e to go when they go to the hospital, so it's not so scary and daunting and maybe so scar y and so daunting that perhaps someone doesn't show up, because it just sounds a l ittle too overwhelming. (key informant, health advocacy) We have transportation services that allow many sen iors access to the centers, because otherwise they'd have no other way of getting here. We provide transportation to medical appointments. And not only do we provide the transpo rtation, but we ... launched an escort program. So in addition to providing the act ual transportation, we now will assist by providing a companion to travel with the senior, because what we were finding was that both in physical frailty as well as cognitive frailty, seniors needed more assistance, because they often became disoriented or needed tha t help in navigating through the holes ... and even in medical buildings, you know, it 's very difficult. And even though you may have been there before, sometimes it looks diff erent. (key informant, CBO) Particularly for immigrant communities, CHWs\u2014whethe r they be health educators, navigators, or advocates\u2014helped to ameliorate the pervasive lan guage and cultural barriers: Bx App D - 29I don't care where you come from, but it has to be people seeing people [in the hospital] who look like them, that are like them, who speak l ike them and who feel like this people are - have my interests on my - their mind. ... Seri ously, you need to have a program where you have people who look like me [West Africa n], who will be there to pass along information to the people is critical . (focus group participant) CHWs were reported to be particularly valuable and effective in ensuring that hospital discharge plans are effectively implemented, as discharge pla nning was seen as generally problematic: I think one of the things we do miserably in New Yo rk City ... is horrible discharge planning, horrible, horrible. And if there were th ese advanced primary care workers or at least community health workers, I think one of t he main things I would really have them do is think about discharge planning. If [DSR IP] money is going through hospitals, I would really, No. 1, think about discharge planni ng and how to make that really real and follow-up calls and texts and whatever for all these folks. And making sure that there's really a system, and that the community hea lth worker or advanced primary care worker gets a copy of that discharge plan and follo ws up with the patient . (key informant, health advocacy) Care Coordination/Case Management: Across populatio ns and conditions, care coordinator and case management models were described as highly eff ective approaches for improving health and reducing health care use. Multiple key informan ts cited research studies that demonstrated positive outcomes during implementation of care coo rdination programs. Responsibilities of care coordinators included linkage and serving as liaiso n to multiple providers, health education, assistance with accessing entitlement and supportiv e services, and monitoring the stability and engagement of clients. Care coordination was seen as valuable in part because of excessive fragmentation within the healthcare system, and it was emphasized that developing care coordination programs did not diminish the need for improved integration of care. This silo specialization in medicine is a problem f or everybody, but it's a particular problem for the geriatric population with, you know , 12 medications and four presenting conditions. And so that anything that can happen to not just coordinate but actually integrate care across specialties so that when you do need the interaction of the medical institution for it to deal with a whole person as a whole person, not by its individually, coded and billed body parts would be really importa nt. Anything that could happen along those lines would help everybody, but it woul d particularly help our guys...All our social workers can tell you stories and we could sa y personally, you know, the orthopedist comes in and says, well you know, \"Mrs. Smith, yeah, your hip will be great,\" but Mrs. Smith has dementia and Mrs. Smith is not going to recover in a great way. You know, he's solely looking at one body part . And he's not thinking what the rehab Bx App D - 30is going to be like... and the disorientation. And t he family is left standing like, \"Are you kidding, what are you talking about?\" (key informant, multiservice organization) Unfortunately, funds for care coordination are lim ited and salaries for the positions are relatively low. Low salaries make hiring difficult and may ne cessitate selection of candidates that are under-qualified, particularly considering the expec tations of the job, which include work with challenging populations, familiarity with multiple psychosocial and health issues (and the services available to address them), as well as the logistic and administrative aspects of the position, including use of multiple electronic heal th records. We have to find people that are from the managed c are world, that are from the hospital world. We have to find professionals that understa nd those worlds and they also have to be database professionals, they have to be able to navigate Navitar, they have to be able to navigate Dashboard, they have to be able to inpu t information into these databases, and into our own database, and to be able to do it many times offsite. You're stuck between a rock and hard place, because people with enough skills and training to work with such a high acuity, in most cases, group of cl ients. But then also they'll have, like the background is more like data entry... You want t hem to come in with some of the skills, 50% of the skills, I mean, maybe we have to teach them the other 50%. Maybe they come in with substance abuse skills but they don't know mental health and they don't diabetes and primary healthcare concerns, or maybe it's the other way around. It feels like [it's too much to ask of a person], but you hav e to make it work. (key informant multiservice agency). Lack of trust or engagement in care coordination o n the part of medical providers was also considered to limit the potential effectiveness of care coordination models. What's missing is ... saying to individual providers that this is important, and you need to be responsive, and you need to talk to people, a nd you need to interact with care coordinators. One of the biggest problems and flaw s in the system is that in all of our contracts... we're required to go to providers, indiv idual PCP's and psychiatrists, and get information from them both about their care tha t they're providing to our client or their patient or the lab work that's been done, tes ts, reports, anything that they're doing with our patient. We need to get access to that in formation so that we can help to provide better care and to guide that person along in the care that they're getting. So if they get prescribed a specific medication, we can s ay, \"Are you taking that medication? Where are you at with it? Have you filled the pres cription?\" Those kind of things. The problem is, on the provider's side, they don't get paid. No one's telling them - no one's saying to them from the funder level ... \"You must co mmunicate with these people.\"... so the providers ignore us. (key informant, multiservice organization) Bx App D - 31 Finally, a electronic health records were describe d as challenging for agencies offering care coordination services, as they had to utilize multi ple systems. The State's not equipped to be able to mandate [a consistent electronic health record]. So everybody is left on their own to be able to des ign their own or to pick and choose an on-the-shelf or off-the-shelf package. And that's been what's causing the mess. So then not only do you have that, but you also don't have t he communication between Health Homes to talk about a client, where a client is... be ing able to get some kind of a text message or an email saying a client is in an emerge ncy room or a hospital. ...that should be really enhanced where we have much more access t o the client's status, where that client is, when the client is in crisis, so that we can intervene and help the client . (key informant, multiservice agency) Health Education: Health education was a common the me in interviews and focus groups, incorporating both education of the broader public and individual level education regarding management of complex health conditions. It was emp hasized the education has to be comprehensive and ongoing in order to affect behavi or change. You have to continue to be out there every so often asking, like, 'What's going on? Who are you? You know, where you from? What do you prac tice?'\" And that's the way it is. Education, health education has to be dynamic. It h as to be ongoing. You have to constantly remind people about, \"If you're gonna ha ve sex with multiple partners, you should really use a condom.\" (key informant, CBO) It's been proven if we can have health educators de dicated to an individual to work with them, to see them on a regular basis, people tend t o respond more, you know. So the one- on-one care works. It does. (key informant, CBO) We're gonna have to pull our forces together and un itedly, you know, present ongoing seminars, town hall meetings, presentations about v arious health topics, you know. We need to remind people that diabetes is directly - t here's a serious, serious correlation between obesity and diabetes, you know. We need to just keep plugging that in. (key informant, CBO) Topics for education of the broader public included immigrant rights, sexual health, health literacy, tobacco cessation, and nutrition, as well as access and appropriate use of health care services, such as preventive health care and screeni ng, mental health care, and emergency care. Bx App D - 32I feel that the ER should explain to the people tha t if their problem is not that serious if it's not serious, because the emergency [department ] is for the emergency. It's for right now. It's not because I got a common cold ... that's your primary care doctor. They really need to emphasize what the ER is for and rea lly let these people know that they need to start turning them away if it's not an emer gency. (focus group participant) Information related to general awareness and to beh avior change were both considered important. Health fairs, faith based programing, an d school based programming were all seen as important venues for the dissemination of informati on\u2014and for health screening. School-based programming recommendations incorporated both a ret urn to a more basic comprehensive curriculum (e.g., offering recess), as well as enha nced offerings. We know what works. What works is being in the schoo ls, providing quality sexual reproductive health education and not just a one-ti me going in there but a series of programs with the same health educator and then hav ing the health educator based in the school building as a continual consistent presence for those kids to be able to know that they can go and talk to somebody about that ... havin g that health educator be able to link kids who are on the verge of sexual activity w ith medical family planning services to help prevent pregnancy. With mental health services , to deal with issues that might lead them to having early sexual initiation or deal with whatever's going on in their house but I think the other part of that is making sure that their medical providers are giving kids private times starting at around age 11 to be able to discuss those sensitive issues without the parent present and those are the things that wo rk ... (key informant, CBO) I believe our people need education. Schools need t o get back to exercise. If our children don't have the exercise and things to make them bus y, our children will not do too much and they won't help the family education themselves . Taking exercise out of the school, the gyms, and various different things is bad. (focus group participant) Some of the communities that we know of\u2014they do a l ot of their health education at faith- based organizations. Faith-based organizations have access to space, for example, so many of them I know will open up their space. Group s can rent it out. They'll have exercise classes or dance classes. So I think they play a huge role. And this idea around shared use agreements, I think would be really fant astic to look at. And then civic - I mean civic associations, too, I mean they reach a c ertain community that might not necessarily be going for social services. So, defin itely ways to integrate them. And then they're trusted in their community. They're leaders there, so if you can convince those members or leaders to partner with you on these pro jects, I think it would be a win-win. (key informant, health advocacy) Bx App D - 33 Quality of Care Several concerns related to quality of care were re peatedly raised in focus groups and key informant interviews. Each of these were reported to contribute to delays in care, neglect of care, poor adherence to medical recommendations, an d poor health outcomes. Wait times for appointments People say it's not rational to go to the emergency room for care, but when we talk to people, they would say things like, \"Well, I tried to make an appointment with my doctor, and it's like four months in advance.\" What rationa l person is going to wait four months rather than go [to the ER] (key informant, health advocacy) I know of this one person who was afraid that she h ad cancer of some type, and she had an appointment that was three months away. She sai d after a week she was going bonkers, went to the ER, says, \"Let them test me he re, let them run the x-rays and all that,\" and that's what she did. And she got inform ation before the three month period. She said, \"I could be dead by then.\" (Key informant , CBO) Wait times on the day of a visit The wait [in the ER] is better than you gotta wait for clinic....when I go to clinic, I have a one o'clock appointment, this is my thing with them : if I got a one o'clock appointment, why, \"Here it is two o'clock, three o'clock, you're calling, and I'm still here?\" You ain't gonna see everybody at one o'clock, don't have me s it there for five or six hours. Are you kidding me? I tell them, \"I'm leaving, because now I've got to go get something to eat, because now my sugar went down, and go back upstair s and wait, and sit on that hard chair, with no cushion. Are you kidding me?\" Here i t is six, seven o'clock at night, here I am coming home from a one o'clock appointment. Are you kidding me? Then they wonder why I don't come. (focus group participant) Short visits that did not allow for health needs to be appropriately addressed. Community members feel that providers do what is expedient ra ther than what represents the highest quality of care. Related to brief visits are poor communication skills. Where I go, you would think that they do not like s eeing patients. Instead of feeling comfortable, you feel bad. Then you wait for so lon g only to be seen for 5 minutes. (focus group participant) I've already had cancer. I've got cancer again. I t old the doctor: \"I want the other breast removed.\" They looked at me like I had just grown a nother head. And she never answered me, and she never told me if it was a good idea or a bad idea. And I'm still waiting for an answer and it's been over a year. No respect. (focus group participant) Bx App D - 34 Multiple and complicated referral pathways, that re sult in significant inconvenience and expense for patients. Furthermore, the possible n eed for multiple visits (e.g., for tests) discourages timely use of services. When you go [to the health center], you always got to get a referral for this, for that, and the third. So you are going to end up in a two fare zone. To get to that referral, because they never conduct it on site. They could say, 'Oka y you have a problem with your left eye. Here is a referral to go 40 blocks away, and t hat's where you have to go, and you come back here for your results. But then I might g ive you a referral to go to the GYN that is 50 blocks away,\" and so forth and so on. S o either way you look at it, you are getting on the train, while they are right around t he corner. (focus group participant) Poor discharge planning after emergency department visits and inpatient stays. Patients are discharged without a clear understanding of their d ischarge plan, including medication use and follow-up visits\u2014or confirmation that needed su pports are in place. In addition, follow- up appointments are not necessarily consistent or l ogical. For example, patients discharged after hospital stays will be referred to other inst itutions due to payment concerns. Or, in contrast, ED patients that have a primary care prov ider will be referred to a hospital clinic for follow-up care. Patients that are going hungry and they don't even ask the question - is there enough food in the home or do you need a referral to a foo d pantry or Meals on Wheels program? And then, you know, if they're going throu gh their treatment and there are all these other medications and you don't have food, it upsets everything and it contributes to another visit to the hospital (key informant, community based organization) Kids walk into the emergency room with a Medicaid c ard that says that they have Health First and they get prescribed the medicine in the e mergency room and then they get scheduled with a follow-up appointment at that hosp ital's clinic even though their pediatrician is on the card Does that make sense? No. (Key informant, provider) If I'm hospitalized at Hospital X, and I have an ou tpatient service - the expectation ... is that: You've had them on your inpatient service fo r two weeks. Have this institutional transference and pop them into your outpatient serv ice - whether it be psych or medical. It's not happening [for homeless patients]. They'r e being sent to walk-in clinics. If it's a voluntary hospital, we're not seeing them take owne rship. Sometimes they're sent to an HHC hospital.... The hospitals - and I say this not o nly about our psychiatrically ill populations but even about our Family shelters: Th ey have no clue, for the most part, as to where these homeless people are landing, what se rvices are in the shelters, what connection they have to medical services, what they 're able and not able to do. You can't give a single adult or a street homeless person an appointment for a colonoscopy three Bx App D - 35weeks from now. You can't. If you think that some body needs a colonoscopy - you have to do it while you have them inpatient. (Key informant, provider) Lack of knowledge, sensitivity, and competency re garding diverse populations, and populations with special health needs, the foreign born and older adults When people with disabilities go to seek care, some one sees them in terms of their diagnosis. \"Oh, you are the person with MS. You a re the person with the [traumatic brain injury]. You are the person with cerebral pa lsy.\" And so you are not seen as the person who is sexually active and needs advice abou t that. Or who may be drinking excessively. Or who may be drugging and self-medic ating. You are not seen as the person who needs vaccinations. You are not seen as the person who needs advice about smoking cessation. After all, your quality of life must be so poor that at least I could allow you smoking. So I'm not going to bother to g ive you smoking messages because I'm assuming that if I were you, I would feel so ba d about myself. So there's also a mythology about people with disabilities, that we a re all depressed as well. So why bother to counsel you about any of these other thin gs? (key informant, health advocacy) Community members have reported back that doctors a nd health care professionals in general talk about certain illnesses, like diabetes , hypertension, heart [disease] - a lot of these things are inevitable, right? Or kind of like , \"Okay, you have hypertension, here's your medication,\" as opposed to actually there are things that you can do, lifestyle changes that you can make. I remember we had a real ly well-known pastor at an organization we're working with in the Bronx, and h e said that he didn't know that if you had diabetes, it didn't mean that you had to have a limb amputated, which is pretty nuts, right? That because you have diabetes it does not m ean that you have to lose limbs. I think, for whatever reason, providers may feel like when they're talking with certain populations that it's not worth it to talk about wh at else you can do to address your needs that's not medication or that's not amputation. And there may be some cultural biases that are - there are culture biases, I think, that are built into that way of talking to the patient (key informant, health advocacy) SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Low income, uninsured, and immigrant populations, a s described above, face a number multiple barriers to optimal health and health care use. Ho wever, within these populations, there are a number of groups for which the barriers are exacerba ted. These include individuals with disabilities, as well as individuals that are lesbi an, gay, and transgender (LGBT); criminal justice involved; homeless; or victims or survivors of dome stic violence. A number of these groups are also high users of expensive medical services due t o a combination of greater medical need and barriers to community based services. Bx App D - 36Individuals with Disabilities: Individuals with phy sical and/or cognitive disabilities are disproportionately low income, unemployed, and have a high number of co-morbidities, including obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Despite a high need for services, they reportedly delay care because of poor accommod ation (e.g., absence of ramps, absence of sign language interpreters, poor transit services) and providers that are insensitive to both their capabilities and their limitations. These access ba rriers\u2014and their implications\u2014 were described by CNA participants. I have access-a-ride. Access-a-ride doesn't take me anywhere in the Bronx. It goes to Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island. But I cannot us e it here in the Bronx. Now the last time I called them for them to take me to [Manhatta n], I went over to Fifth Avenue to the hospital. She told me \"You can take this bus, and i t will take you to Manhattan, and that bus will drop you off.\" And then I said, \"so what d o I do now? I have difficulty walking.\" And where they were gonna drop me off would have be en at least two blocks and that hospital I was going to I know for a fact, two bloc ks is like four. I'm gonna have to walk. And I couldn't walk so I said \"I have to walk there . What do you suggest I do?\" \"Uh, well uh ma'am.\" I said \"You can't help me. Thank yo u very much.\" (focus group participant) Unfortunately, barriers are considered more signifi cant in community as compared to hospital settings so may become more pronounced as\u2014consisten t with the goals of DSRIP\u2014services move into the community. As explained by a key info rmant in the field: A requirement, for example, that you come to an appo intment timely, or if you miss an appointment three times, you can be dis-enrolled fr om a program or a provider, [is discriminatory]. If you use Access-a-Ride, for exa mple, it is almost impossible to know when you will arrive at a location on a consistent basis. The service is simply of such poor quality that if ... you need door-to-door transp ortation, you need flexibility in appointment scheduling. In the health setting, practitioners are often list ed - clinics are often listed as being wheelchair accessible in managed care program direc tories. But in fact, according to a survey by the Community Service Society, it was fou nd that these practitioners have steps at their front entrance. The providers don't even know what accessibility means. And so they list themselves as accessible, but when you go to their site or you call them on the phone, they'll say, \"Oh yes, we have a few [steps] at our entrance, but that's no big deal.\" They don't have exam tables that will lower so that you can transfer from a wheelchair. Or they don't provide ASL interpreters, either in p erson or by video phone or other Bx App D - 37system. .... They don't give you longer times for y our appointment if it's going to take you a long time to dress and undress... LGBT: The LGBT population has both typical and part icular health concerns. Utilization of health care services\u2014even the ER\u2014is reported to be less than needed, due to lack of sensitivity on the part of providers. Although the lack of sen sitivity is particularly pronounced with respect to transgender patients, it affects lesbian, gay an d bisexual individuals, as well. So there are health disparities that we know exist among LGBT older people. And part of this has to do with the fact that they're so much l ess likely to reach out for help and so much less likely to get screening. So there's a hi gher rate of breast and gynecological cancers among lesbian women. There are higher rate s of rectal cancer and prostate cancer among gay and bisexually identified men. (key informant, CBO) They're not willing to be forthcoming with their pr oviders, they withhold information from their providers, they're real reluctant partic ularly with transgender folks to engage in health care on so many levels, and we could talk for hours about trans people like getting disrobed, \"What room do you go into, what's your name on the form, why doesn't this match your insurance card, why do you have bre asts and a penis, can I touch this?\" (key informant, health care organization) But even when I was in the hospital with my mother. I went there with no makeup. I clearly have boobs, have my long hair. I looked we ird, and no one gave me the respect or anything. When I used to open my mouth before, I got attention and I got whatever I needed. Now it's like, \"You're a freak, go away.\" (focus group participant) Isolation and perceived stigma lead to mental heal th issues in the LGBT population. I think for many LGBT people, they're separate from other minority groups, the isolation from levels of support starts at a very young age a nd it's within the family and within the local community and so there is a lot of effective issues that people experience just from an early age onward. I wouldn't say that the preval ence of psychiatric diagnosis is greater, but there is a substantial amount of the a ffective issues of mood anxiety, depression and with those in particular for anxiety and depression, substances play a very key role in modulating mood. ( key informant, health care organization) Criminal Justice Involved: Working with individuals that have been involved in the criminal justice system requires nonjudgmental staff that ar e familiar with the practical (e.g., deactivations of Medicaid, parole regulations), med ical, and psychosocial issues faced, including Bx App D - 38the limited economic options and high rates of trau ma and mental illness. According to a key informant that works in correctional health, this p opulation is comprised of: The sickest people in the city, who are the most so cioeconomically disadvantaged, the most stigmatized and the least likely to access car e in a way that would be, exclusive of using the emergency room and that sort of thing....I think, honestly, with the, state emptying the psychiatric facilities, which nobody l iked, but I'm not sure that jail is a better alternative. And right now we're talking abo ut 40% of [the Rikers] population are mentally ill. And about 60 to 80% have some kind o f behavioral health issue. And then we're talking about, you know, folks with chronic h ealth conditions and the population in jails is aging, so now we've got diabetes and heart disease at much higher rates. (key informant, government) Bridging connections directly from jails/prisons t o community based organizations and providers upon re-entry was recommended, so as to a void emergency department use post- release: [There are] increased rates of hospitalization and emergency department visits post release. We've shown both those things. So anything that we do to try to systematically reduce hospitalizations would definitely benefit fr om partnering with local jails to help facilitate what I call warm transitions to primary care for medical and to behavioral health treatment, including drug treatment, substan ce use treatment, so that we can avoid people coming to the emergency room 'cause that's w hat they're gonna do if they don't have - if they don't have a plan. I think it's kind of a no-brainer. (key informant, government) Homeless Population: The NYC Department of Homeless Services houses approximately 55,000 people per night through its shelter system; there are an estimated 3,000 people living on the street in NYC. The homeless population includes si ngle adults and families with and without children. Although many are people that have come into the system due to particular interpersonal or economic difficulties, others have behavioral health issues that make it difficult to remain housed, and which may be, in turn, furthe r exacerbated by homelessness. According to a key informant that works with the homeless: A lot of clients have very significant mental illne ss; very significant substance use - largely, alcohol, but ... a lot of opioids. ... Our c lients are not different than the highest poverty clients. (key informant, government) Homeless individuals are reported to be frequent u sers of emergency services, not only because of health conditions, but because of the instabilit y in their lives. Bx App D - 39 [Homeless] clients use EMS all the time for things that - if one were confident that they had a medical home - they would be calling. A chil d has a 102 degree fever - this is not a newborn. We would call our pediatrician and ask what to do. But, they are not calling pediatricians.... I think, often feel disconnected. Maybe they've been placed in a borough that is not their home borough, and they're not con nected to the doctor who was across the street. (key informant, government) Recommendations for improved coordination of care, more efficient use of services, and improved health, focus on targeted outreach and car e coordination involving multiple hospital staff persons, including social workers in the emer gency department and on the inpatient service. In addition, key informants in multiple fields emph asized the importance of supportive housing for high need homeless populations. The [supportive housing] staff is there for relapse . So, \"You stop taking your meds,\" it's that staff that's going to know. Maybe it might be a neighbor who notices first, and it's reported to the case manager who comes up and has a relationship, and it's like, \"Is everything okay? Do we need to put you in the hosp ital for a week?\" But making sure that the main goal is housing stability, right? So doin g everything they can so the person doesn't lose their apartment. Which would happen, or probably did happen in their past life, particularly with mental illness or substance abuse. You decompensate and there's nobody there to help you before you lose your apart ment. So you end up in the shelter, the jail, the psych unit, before you can get back (key informant, health advocacy) Bx App D - 40DISCUSSION Bronx community members and other stakeholders are clearly interested in partnering with hospitals and health care providers and being part of solutions that promote good health and reduced hospitalizations. Many are wary, fearing t hat hospitals will not fully engage with the community going forward, as most lack experience do ing so and the financial incentives of health system re-engineering are unclear. The predo minant themes in the Bronx are persistent poverty, environmental hazards, and systemic neglec t. Focus group and interview participants articulated specific barriers to good health and go od health care, many of which were related to poverty and its consequences, including long work h ours, unstable housing, unsafe neighborhoods and the need to prioritize expenditur es\u2014even among basic needs. For specific groups, including the disabled, LGBTQ, criminal jus tice involved, and the homeless, health- related barriers were compounded, due to both attit udinal and practical considerations. Focus group and interview participants also articul ated potential \"fixes,\" such as increased ease of access for medical visits (e.g., reduced wait ti me, reduced insurance restrictions, increased integrated care); improved provider sensitivity; an d a range of supportive services, including community health workers, care coordinators\u2014particu larly for difficult to manage medical conditions and high risk populations\u2014and navigators . Health education, addressing (for example) prevention, screening, disease management, insurance, and appropriate use of health care services, was considered essential at the indi vidual and the community level, to ensure that the population has the knowledge and skills necessa ry for independent action that promotes their own good health.
