The Public Health Agency - our role, purpose and ac tivities The Public Health Agency (PHA) is the statutory bod y responsible for improving and protecting the health of our population and an inte gral part of the Health and Social Care (HSC) system, working closely with the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB), local Health Trusts (HSC Trusts), the Business Serv ices Organisation (BSO) and the Patient Client Council (PCC). Central to our main responsibilities is working in close partnership with individuals, groups and organisations from all sectors - communi ty, voluntary and statutory. The PHA was set up with the explicit agenda to: protect public health; improve the health and social wellbeing of people in Northern Ireland; work to reduce health inequalities between people in Northern Ireland; and work with the HSCB, providing professional input t o the commissioning of health and social care services. The PHA is a multi-disciplinary, multi-professional body with a strong regional and local presence. During 2021/22, the PHA continued to work and be gu ided by our purpose, vision and values, as set out in our Corporate Plan 2017 - 2021, which was rolled forward 2 into 2021/22 as advised by the Department of Health (DoH); however our focus was on responding to the challenges of COVID-19. Our purpose to protect and improve the health and social wellb eing of our population and reduce health inequalities through strong partnersh ips with individuals, communities and other key public, private and volun tary organisations. Our vision all people and communities are enabled and support ed in achieving their full health and wellbeing potential, and inequalities in health are reduced. Our values we put individuals and communities at the heart of everything we do in improving their health and social wellbeing and reducing heal th inequalities; we act with openness and honesty and treat all wit h dignity, respect and compassion as we conduct our business; we work in partnership with individuals, communiti es and other public, private, community and voluntary organisations to improve th e quality of life of those we serve; we listen to and involve individuals and communiti es; we value, develop and empower our staff and strive for excellence and innovation; and we are evidence-led and outcomes-focused. HSC values In addition we subscribe to the values and associat ed behaviours that all staff working within Health and Social Care (HSC) are exp ected to display at all times. 3 HSC Value What does this mean? What does this look like in practice? - Behaviours Working Together We work together for the best outcome for people we care for and support. We work across Health and Social Care and with other external organisations and agencies, recognising that leadership is the responsibility of all. I work with others and value everyone's contribution I treat people with respect and dignity I work as part of a team looking for opportunities to support and help people in both my own and other teams I actively engage people on issues that affect them I look for feedback and examples of good practice, aiming to improve where possible Compassion We are sensitive, caring, respectful and understanding towards those we care for and support and our colleagues. We listen carefully to others to better understand and take action to help them and ourselves. I am sensitive to the different needs and feelings of others and treat people with kindness I learn from others by listening carefully to them I look after my own health and well-being so that I can care for and support others Excellence We commit to being the best we can be in our work, aiming to improve and develop services to achieve positive changes. We deliver safe, high-quality, compassionate care and support. I put the people I care for and support at the centre of all I do to make a difference I take responsibility for my decisions and actions I commit to best practice and sharing learning, while continually learning and developing I try to improve by asking 'could we do this better?' Openness & Honesty We are open and honest with each other and act with integrity and candour. I am open and honest in order to develop trusting relationships I ask someone for help when needed I speak up if I have concerns I challenge inappropriate or unacceptable behaviour and practice 4 Chair's Foreword On behalf of the Board I would like to pay tribute to the staff of the Public Health Agency for their unswerving and diligent response t o a second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Staff have also worked tirelessly in orde r to restore those services which either had to be reduced or paused at the height of the pandemic. I am delighted that in this year the PHA was able t o appoint a permanent Chief Executive. Aidan Dawson took up his post on 1 July 2021. Prior to his appointment, Aidan held a range of director positions in Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland, as well as having served in the voluntary sector. I would like to thank Olive Macleod OBE who underto ok the role of Interim Chief Executive at the commencement of the pandemic. She oversaw the establishment of the contact tracing service and ensured that the PH A acted promptly to reduce the major health threats caused by the virus and its va riants. I also wish to express my immense appreciation to t he Department of Health and in particular to Professor Sir Michael McBride for ste adfast leadership during the last two years. In the birthday honours list of 2021, Pr ofessor McBride's contribution was fittingly recognised with a knighthood. The Department of Health and the PHA are now in the process of designing and implementing a new operating model. This new model will both refresh and reshape the PHA in order to address effectively the public health needs of the people of Northern Ireland into the next decade and beyond. The PHA is keen to ensure the appointment of indivi duals from a broad range of disciplines to become public health consultants. Th e Board continues to review its committee structure and looks forward to contributi ng to this new model in every way possible. 5 I wish to record the contribution of two local coun cillors who served on the Board of the PHA for almost 10 years. Alderman Paul Porter a nd Alderman William Ashe MBE brought great understanding and knowledge of co mmunity issues to our deliberations in the boardroom. We were delighted in October 2021 to welcome two ne w local government appointees to the Board in Councillor Robert Irvine from Fermanagh and Omagh District Council and Alderman Phillip Brett from An trim and Newtownabbey Borough Council. Alderman Brett previously served on the Board of th e Northern Ireland Housing Executive and Councillor Irvine presently serves on the Board of the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service. In addition Mrs Anne Henderson OBE has been appoint ed as non-executive director with financial experience. Mrs Henderson is a forme r Chair of the Parades Commission for Northern Ireland and a former Vice C hair of the Board of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. I want to record appreciation and thanks to members of the Board, both executive and non-executive, who went above and beyond the ca ll of duty in a particularly demanding year. We look forward in the coming year to ensure refres hed clarity of focus for the objectives of the PHA, not just in the immediate ye ars but for the decade ahead. Andrew Dougal OBE Chair of the Board Public Health Agency for Northern Ireland 6 Chief Executive's Report The past year has proven to be extremely demanding as we continued to face the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic while trying to get on with normal business as much as possible. PHA staff met those challenges head-on, delivering solutions that have made a difference while continuing to work to improve the general health and wellbeing of our communities. Since joining the PHA, I have been tremendously imp ressed with the resolve and professionalism of PHA staff, working as a team wit h drive and determination. Our people have not been found wanting, and have contin ually risen to whatever has been asked of them. The organisation has had to be agile and adapted qu ickly to the emergence of new COVID-19 variants and peaks in case numbers. We inc reased our staff complement at the height of the pandemic, and evolved new serv ices including enhancements to the Contact Tracing Service to meet the significant rise in COVID-19 cases. Growing the organisation in such a short timescale has been demanding, especially in the middle of a pandemic when many staff have been work ing remotely. I am immensely proud of the effort that has been put into adapting how we work quickly and effectively. This has resulted in lives being saved . Adversity brings with it opportunity and one of the most significant developments has been the targeted use of data science, information and analytics. We have taken significant strides forward in developing leading e dge real-time information streams which underpin our surveillance and analytics syste ms, relying on greater automation than at any time previously. This work h as helped target our interventions during the pandemic, and the learning we have taken from it will be of significant benefit in how we do things in future. Genomic sequencing and behavioural science capacity has become further established within Northern Ireland, and through pa rtnerships with academia, tech, HSC and other partners, we have brought a targeted focus underpinning the pandemic response. 7 Vaccination has played a major role in the battle a gainst coronavirus, and the roll-out of new vaccines across society formed the biggest b reakthrough in this pandemic. The PHA has, together with the wider HSC family, pl ayed a key role in achieving approximately 90% uptake amongst the adult populati on - in line with other regions across these islands. Of course this, and the gener al actions which people have taken to help protect themselves and others through out the pandemic, is testament to the responsibility and responsiveness that the p ublic has shown in taking on board the significant and often fast-moving messaging as evidence emerged and responses were developed. In 2022, responsibility for coordination of the COV ID-19 vaccination programme is moving to the PHA, which will again require a new l evel of focus to ensure that we have the capacity available to deliver it as part o f our existing vaccination programmes. The annual report provides a snapshot across a rang e of work undertaken during the year, with a particular focus on the management of COVID-19. The Department of Health advised that our corporate strategy would be rolled over for 2021/22, and our business plan for 2021/22 acknowledged that while t he focus of the programme would be the COVID-19 response, where possible we w ould hope to return to non- COVID business as soon as possible. However, the emergence of the Delta and latterly Om icron variants has resulted in PHA staff at various stages during the year steppin g in to provide additional sustained support to Health Protection and contact tracing functions. This has had an impact on the delivery of some key objectives, b ut notwithstanding good progress has been achieved. Work has also continued across o ur areas of responsibility including health improvement, screening, Nursing an d Allied Health Professionals, quality and safety, and Research & Development. Change has been a constant feature over the past tw o years and will undoubtedly continue as the pandemic transitions into an endemi c state in the future. Looking ahead, we can envisage a period of major st rategic change in health, beginning with the closure of our commissioning par tner the HSCB and its transfer of 8 functions into the Department of Health in the form of a new Strategic Planning and Performance Group. This will be closely followed by the roll-out of a new integrated care planning system that will help to ensure that the people's health needs are best met through a population health planning approach, including prevention and early intervention. We currently have a unique 'reset' opportunity and to this end the PHA, together with the Department of Health, have commenced a review p rocess which will bring forward plans for taking on board the hard-earned l earning from the last two years while ensuring that the PHA is best placed to lead on the response to the key strategic challenges locally, nationally and intern ationally in the months and years ahead. While we work our way through the future stages of the pandemic, there will be new public health challenges that we need to be ready t o face. For example, we already know there are significant health inequalities expe rienced by people living in the most deprived areas compared with those in the leas t deprived, leading to ill-health and earlier death. The cost-of-living crisis, with increased costs for food, fuel and other necessities, could exacerbate this further an d have a real detrimental impact on health and wellbeing, so we need to be creative, collaborative and effective in how we work to reduce this within a public health c ontext. We have gone through an unprecedented couple of yea rs which impacted on all of our lives - no one has been untouched by this pande mic. As we emerge and look to the future, the hard work of our staff and the lear ning we have taken from our experiences will enable the PHA to move forward eve n more effectively in helping to protect and improve people's health and wellbeing. Aidan Dawson Chief Executive Public Health Agency 9 Performance Analysis The PHA Annual Business Plan 2021-2022 sets out the key actions for the year commencing 1 April 2021 and ending 31 March 2022 to meet ministerial priorities and deliver on outcomes set out in the Corporate Pl an for 2017/21 which was rolled forward to 2021/22 at the request of the Department of Health due to the backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 response. Staff across the PHA , as well as Board members, were engaged with, and contributed to, the content of the plan. The plan was also developed in alignment with the Draft Programme for Government 2016-2021 , Making Life Better 2012-2023 , Health and Wellbeing 2026: Delivering Together and the evolving community planning arrangements. A key element identified at the time of developing the Annual Business Plan was the overriding priority of focusing on the ongoing COVI D-19 pandemic and ensuring that key interventions needed to contain and manage the virus, such as testing, contact tracing, surveillance, roll out of the vaccination programme and public behaviour messaging were effectively implemented, whilst also endeavouring to balance 'business as usual' as far as possible. In the cont ext of guidance from the Department of Health, the Annual Business Plan 2021-2022 contains 53 targets to take forward the five agreed key outcome themes: 1) COVID-19 Response; 2) Health Protection; 3) Health Improvement; 4) Shaping future health; and 5) Our organisation works effectively. Progress is reported to the PHA Board through quart erly progress reports. Performance against these targets has been of a hig h standard. The figures in the following table set out the posi tion at 31 March 2022. 10 Green On target 44 Amber Slight delay 9 Red Significant delay / will not be completed 0 TOTAL 53 The following pages highlight some of the key actio ns taken forward during 2021/22. They reflect work across all of the PHA Directorate s and functional areas. It should be noted however, that as we had to flexibly refocu s our activities during 2021/22 to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic with staff redeplo yments, a lot of work commenced throughout the year has had to be paused for periods of time. 11 COVID-19 Timeline A brief timeline for some of the key events that ha ve marked the pandemic to the end of March 2022 is illustrated in the following t imeline. 12 13 14 The Public Health Agency response to COVID-19 As Northern Ireland entered the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was evident that the demands facing the PHA were set to continue and would require an even greater level of dedicated professional resour ces. The logistical challenges in rolling out a new and complex vaccination programme across the population while continuing to respond t o the unpredictable trajectory of emerging variants of concern would demand an unprec edented level of synergy across the HSC family, in partnership with all aspe cts of society in Northern Ireland. Central to this was the role, support and work of t he PHA. This report describes some of the work undertaken b y the PHA during 2021/22, providing an insight into the breadth of the PHA re sponse across directorates and functions. These areas include: The role of health protection in the response to COVID-19; Development of the Northern Ireland Contact Traci ng Service; Support for the education sector; Supporting the care home sector; Infection prevention and control during the pande mic; Collaborative approach to surge management; The Research and Development response to COVID-19 ; Vaccination programmes; The impact of COVID-19 on screening services; Health and wellbeing improvement initiatives; Supporting mental health and emotional wellbeing during COVID-19; The key role of communication during a pandemic; Planning and operational response; and Health & Social Care Quality Improvement (HSCQI) response to the pandemic. 15 The role of PHA Health Protection in the response t o COVID-19 The PHA Health Protection directorate has continued to provide sustained and intensive leadership, intelligence and health prote ction expertise during 2021/22, in addition to delivering essential ongoing acute resp onse and proactive health protection programmes. Over 38,000 enquiries regarding COVID-19 have been managed through the PHA Health Protection Acute Response Service, which is responsible for investigating and managing clusters and outbreaks of infectious d isease. The service operates 24 hours a day, seven days a w eek and has provided the professional lead for a large number of multi-disci plinary incident control teams for the management of outbreaks in a range of settings including churches, care homes, schools and colleges, workplaces, and health care s ettings. The service works in close partnership with HSC Tru sts, Local Councils, the Health and Safety Executive and the Education Authority to prevent and bring outbreaks under control and has continued to collaborate full y with colleagues from UK and Republic of Ireland to share learning, assess evide nce and influence policy. The PHA has produced and contributed to the develop ment of guidance and policies in relation to COVID-19 across many different setti ngs, including for the general public, vulnerable people, care homes, hospitals, f uneral directors and schools. A dedicated guidance cell was established to respond to queries about application of COVID-19 guidance, and has managed almost 1,000 enq uiries to date. During spring and summer 2021, a further wave of in fection with the more transmissible and more severe Delta variant was man aged. Initial steps included mandatory ten days hotel quarantine for returnees f rom 'red list' countries and mass testing of residents in targeted areas to find and isolate cases. Incident management teams were held to control outbreaks, and to reduce onward transmission. 16 There was a further surge of infection when schools went back after the summer holidays, and the PHA worked closely with schools a nd the Education Authority to support them in managing cases and clusters. This i ncluded the production of a suite of letters, guidance and information resources for schools, parents and children. In November 2021, the PHA stood up a response to th e emerging Omicron variant first identified in South Africa. This included lia ising directly with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa to obtain real time information to inform our risk assessment and planning. Rapid work was un dertaken to characterise the risk from this new variant in terms of transmissibi lity, growth advantage, immune escape and severity. Staff from across the PHA were mobilised to assist with the operational Health Protection response, and in part icular to support care homes during the peak. The Omicron variant posed particular challenges in health care and residential care settings in terms of health care acquired infection s due to its increased transmissibility, and also the reduced staffing lev els they were experiencing at the time. As well as providing guidance and advice to m anage the outbreaks, the PHA also assessed if there were any broader issues of c oncern, for example with staffing or PPE, and escalated these appropriately. Critical to the PHA response has been the further e volution of our systematic surveillance systems. Surveillance is the continuou s process of collection, analysis and interpretation of data related to communicable disease and environmental hazards. To target interventions to prevent and con trol outbreaks, the health protection surveillance team draw from a range of i nformation sources including laboratories, hospitals, GPs, HSC Trusts, UKHSA and lighthouse laboratories. Waste water surveillance has been used to analyse t he trajectory of COVID-19, identify the burden of disease and which age groups and geographical areas are most affected. Outputs are used to inform public he alth decision making, and policy. A bi-weekly early warning report has continued to b e produced, identifying geographical areas of concern within Northern Irela nd where increased resources and testing need to be directed. 17 Confirmed COVID-19 cases by postcode area (week end ing 14 November 2021) COVID-19 case rates and proportion positive by Loca l Government District (7-day rolling average, week ending 9 January 2022) Source: Virology database. 18 COVID-19 internal dashboard During 2021/22 a series of additional refinements h ave been made to the COVID-19 internal dashboard, including information on virolo gy, testing, trends, mortality and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). Weekly reports on CO VID-19 and care homes were produced for the public. Source: Virology database. WGS results have been used to monitor emerging new variants of 'concern' or 'under investigation' and were key in the managemen t of the Delta and Omicron waves in 2021. The WGS team within Health Protectio n Surveillance collaborate with colleagues in UKHSA (formerly PHE), Republic of Ire land, Queens University Belfast, HSC laboratories, the Regional Virology La boratory (RVL) and COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK). Mutations (VAM) profiles and WGS epidemiological reports were produ ced to support this work. A 19 pathogen genomics service development group was con vened in October 2021 to develop the genomics service within Northern Irelan d and to expand to other pathogen in the future. Dedicated surveillance systems are in place to moni tor COVID-19 in high risk populations and settings. For example, care home su rveillance identifies outbreaks in care homes and helps target the advice and suppo rt given. The hospital acquired COVID-19 infection dashboard has provided information on COVID-19 infections in patients who have been admit ted to hospital in Northern Ireland. This information is updated on a daily bas is and can be broken down by HSC Trust, hospital and individual ward level. This enables the PHA and HSC Trusts to quickly identify health care associated infectio ns (HCAIs) and outbreaks, ensuring early investigation and intervention to help to pre vent further spread of COVID-19 in the hospital setting. The dashboard also enables mo nitoring of trends in infection and mortality associated with hospital acquired COV ID-19. PHA health protection staff are represented on nati onal groups to ensure that standardised definitions and methodology are used t o categorise hospital acquired COVID-19 infections to enable comparison with other UK nations. Over the course of the year the PHA has also continued to monitor othe r healthcare associated infections including S. aureus bacteraemias, C. difficile infection, Gram negative bloodstream infections and multi-drug resistant org anisms throughout the pandemic. 20 Hospital Acquired COVID-19 cases in all HSC Trusts: March 2020- March 2022 (extracted from Hospital Acquired COVID-19 Dashboar d 22/03/22 From August 2021, the PHA has led on the roll out o f COVID-19 vaccination for all children and young people (including those at risk) and is currently leading on the vaccination of all over fives. Final preparations a re in place for the roll out of the 'Spring booster', which will be delivered during Ap ril and May 2022. A PHA Low Uptake Group was set up during the year t o identify and implement targeted interventions to support fair access and f air opportunity for everyone to receive their vaccine and thus contribute to increa sing overall population vaccine coverage. An online toolkit for professionals and wider community groups has been developed to use when trying to target areas of low vaccine uptake. This contains a number of examples of good practice from across Nor thern Ireland, as well as practical guides and patient testimonials. 21 Testing for COVID-19 The first positive COVID-19 case in Northern Irelan d was tested on 26 February 2020. In total, at the time of reporting (30 March 2022), a cumulative number of 5,702,409 COVID-19 PCR tests had been completed in Northern Ireland, and 3,012,210 lateral flow device (LFD) tests had been reported. Tests (PCR and LFD) by specimen date, 23 February 2 020 - 30 March 2022. Source: Department of Health: COVID-19 Daily Dashbo ard. The testing programme has evolved in the course of the pandemic to include a variety of technologies. During 2021/22 the PHA tes ting team has continued to work with colleagues across the region, including local test site partners, the Northern Ireland Expert Advisory Group for COVID-19 testing and the Northern Ireland Pathology Network, to develop the testing programme and ensure that it is delivered to a high standard. Staff have linked closely with colleagues working on the testing programmes in England, Scotland and Wales to share knowledge and resources. Pillar 1 Pillar 1 tests are those conducted within the Healt h and Social Care system. Initially this was only through laboratory-based PCR testing but in the course of the pandemic there has been an expansion in the number of technologies available. All HSC Trusts are able to provide COVID-19 testing to their patients and staff. In addition to standard PCR tests, there are now furth er laboratory-based tests with 22 shorter turnaround times and point of care tests wh ich can be done without the sample being transferred to a laboratory. These qui cker tests allow for rapid decision making in the healthcare system. Pillar 2 PCR testing Members of the public are able to access community testing by PCR through Pillar 2 testing sites. For example, during the last quarte r of 2021/22 there were up to five 'drive through' regional test sites and nine 'walk through' local test sites in Northern Ireland, accompanied by a fleet of mobile testing u nits. These mobile units are temporary sites that can be set up quickly in respo nse to local demand. Home testing kits are also available. Information on the Pillar 2 PCR testing sites is available on the PHA website. Lateral flow device (LFD) testing In the course of the last year, there has been sign ificant expansion in LFD testing in Northern Ireland. These rapid tests allow asymptoma tic individuals to test at home, with a result available within 30 minutes. Around o ne third of those with COVID-19 can have no symptoms, so taking a LFD test can iden tify the virus and help individuals to take appropriate steps to stop the s pread of the virus to others. Members of the public are able to order LFD tests o nline for home delivery or can collect them at local collection sites, including p harmacies. In addition, LFDs are available for staff in a variety of settings, inclu ding workforces, health and social care settings and care homes. In schools, all pupils in years 8-14 and all staff were offered LFDs. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) testi ng In 2021, worked with the Education Authorit y and Queen's University Belfast to introduce a programme of LAMP testing fo r pupils and staff at special schools in Northern Ireland. LAMP is a saliva-based test and was felt to be easier than nose and throat swab LFD testing for some chil dren who attend special schools. 23 The LAMP testing programme now uses a second labora tory, based at Ulster University, in addition to Queen's University Belfa st. The testing has been made available to some staff in HSC Trusts as an alterna tive to LFDs. 24 Contact Tracing Centre (CTC) The PHA Contact Tracing Service continued work in 2 021/22. While the successful introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine meant less sev ere disease in many people; the delta and omicron variants were much more trans missible and led to much higher numbers of cases than in previous waves. The PHA responded to this increased demand not only by increasing the headcount of our workforce at pace, but also by introducing a different model of working. We introduced a Tracing Technician role to trace non-c omplex cases which were triaged by the senior team. This also allowed us to focus effort on increasing the uptake of the Digital Self Trace platform which increased to around 30% at the peak of the delta wave. We refined the tracing script in response to each wave in orde r to ensure that the public health interventions for close contacts were timely. The return of schools and colleges in September 202 1 coincided with the peak of the delta wave. This caused a much higher workload for school leadership teams who had been supporting contact tracing by identifying in-school contacts. The definition of a school-aged contact was then revised in line w ith practice across the UK, and the PHA undertook the entire process. In parallel w e worked closely with colleagues in the Education Authority to support the establish ment of a helpdesk where they were the first point of contact for mainstream scho ols and PHA contact channels remained open for support for special schools. In order to provide resilience for the Contact Trac ing Service we continued to train staff from the wider PHA who were able to support d uring the delta and omicron waves when case numbers reached previously unseen l evels. Throughout the year, the PHA responded to various c hanges in policy and operations including for returning travellers, isol ation periods and close contacts. We supported the investigation of clusters, outbreaks and new variants. We provided vital information through our analytics strands tha t influenced modelling and 25 decisions on societal restrictions. The PHA continu ed to perform well even when case numbers exceeded all expectations. We are inc redibly proud of our achievements this year and the people who made them happen. The following charts illustrate the levels of contr act tracing cases over the period May 2020 to March 2022. CTC Cases per week 26 COVID-19 Vaccination Programme Under the direction of the Department of Health, th e COVID-19 vaccination programme has been successfully rolled-out in North ern Ireland, with over 3.7 million doses given to date (achieving 88.38% uptake of fir st doses in those over the age of 12). The PHA has been instrumental in supporting the del ivery of this programme with strategic involvement from the outset, through the provision of a public communication strategy, developing resources to enh ance the campaign, producing PGDs to facilitate vaccine administration, and prov iding expert advice to healthcare professionals and the general public. The programme has substantially reduced the risk from severe COVID-19 and is estimated to have prevented between 23.7 and 24.1 million infections and between 119,500 and 126 ,800 deaths in the UK to date. In advance of the transition of the COVID-19 vaccin ation programme to the PHA, the children's and young people vaccination programme h as been guided by the PHA immunisation team. In conjunction with paediatricia ns and Child Health Heads of Services, the PHA worked to identify cohorts of chi ldren requiring vaccination. Children were issued letters inviting them to bespo ke clinics arranged by each HSC Trust. The PHA communications team also worked to p roduce children-specific information leaflets for parents. While overall upt ake was low (approximately 35% of the estimated cohort), the child health teams were able to deliver vaccines to CEV children under very short timescales with most HSC Trusts offering clinics within three weeks of the announcement in July despite cha llenges such as venue and staff availability. In September 2021, the programme was extended to al l 12 to 15 year olds. Historically, immunisation programmes in school set tings have been successful, with Northern Ireland achieving excellent uptake rates f or other teenage immunisations such as HPV and School Leaver's Booster. With this model in mind, the PHA Immunisation Team worked with HSC Trust school nurs ing teams to administer the COVID-19 vaccine. With the assistance of the Educat ion Authority, the programme 27 was rolled-out through schools and vaccination was offered to all eligible post- primary school children in Northern Ireland by the end of January 2022. Surveillance of the COVID-19 vaccination programmes has been enhanced via a new digital analytics platform, the Vaccine Managem ent System (VMS). This functions as a clinical information system to captu re vaccine administration at the point of care and also permits multi-layered interr ogation of the data. It is used to generate dashboards to display vaccination uptake r ates and identify locations which may require additional resource or an increase in t he accessibility and convenience of vaccination availability. These dashboards have been used to re-invigorate CO VID-19 vaccine low uptake groups. This is a cross-directorate taskforce conve ned within the PHA to target interventions within communities and enable fair ac cess and opportunity for individuals to receive the COVID-19 vaccination. An action plan has been agreed to focus the efforts of all stakeholders within the lo w uptake groups, and a digital toolkit created which offers a collection of resources to s upport the development of targeted initiatives. The whole scale provision of this vaccination at a population level has had an impact on other vaccine programmes. In addition to monitor ing and responding to the anti- vax protests associated with this vaccination and i n particular the schools programme, there has been ongoing efforts across he alth and social care to make provision for all other vaccines. Despite this, the re has been a significant reduction in uptake of other vaccines including HPV, childhood v accine programmes, school leaver's vaccines and the shingles vaccine programm e. As the COVID-19 vaccination programme becomes embed ded into routine healthcare practice and transfers to a business as usual model, there is a planned transition of the adult vaccination programme to th e PHA. The investment and leadership demanded of this extensive programme has been reviewed and will require additional staffing resource, a review of c urrent processes and pathways in addition to new ways of working across the Health P rotection Directorate and the PHA. 28 HSC Research and Development There have been many direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health and wellbeing, often exacerbating existing h ealth inequalities. The last 24 months have made patients, practitioner s, policy makers and the public more aware of the importance of research. They have seen how the development of vaccines and diagnostic tests and the identificatio n of treatments that both work, and don't work, for COVID-19 has relied on research, in particular clinical trials. Research conducted during the pandemic has made an immense p ositive impact on so many people's lives and offers us all hope for the futur e. The PHA Health and Social Care Research and Develop ment Division (HSC R&D) has been at the forefront of the coordination, admi nistration, support and funding of the HSC research ecosystem in Northern Ireland, in particular clinical trials infrastructure (see footnote page 30), to effective ly manage the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure we save lives, protect our HSC services and rebuild services to ensure the health and wellbeing needs of society are effec tively addressed. Almost 30,000 participants from Northern Ireland including staff, patients, carers, students, children and the wider public have now been recruited to par ticipate in COVID-19 research. As society seeks to look beyond the pandemic, HSC R &D Division is acutely aware that the recent priority focus on COVID-19 research , the re-direction of research resources to the care of COVID-19 patients and the impact of measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 has had negative effects for other areas of research. Many studies were slowed or paused, while others have be en abandoned and some that were due to start are still pending. We now need to seize the opportunity to re- invigorate research in NI and build on the successe s seen with COVID-19 to re-start and grow research activity across all areas of heal th and social care. Clinical research has been critical to the treatment of citi zens during the pandemic and is even more crucial for our recovery. We need to move forward with research, setting an agenda that focuses on and is responsive to the most pressing health and social care needs of our society. 29 30 In addition to core R&D business, the Division was on call to support cross-agency activities, such as providing a Scientific and Tech nical Cell during the acute phase of the pandemic, re-deploying team members to support the contact tracing centre, and leading on activities in partnership with other gov ernment and academic institutions. These included: coordinating a local antibody serology study in pa rtnership with the universities and DAERA colleagues, which fed into the pandemic m odelling group; supporting the roll-out of the UK-wide COVID-19 in fection survey in Northern Ireland in partnership with the UK Office of Life S ciences, Department of Health and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency ; convening a Behaviour Change Group, drawing stakeh olders from across government and academic sectors to provide insights to various Departmental and Executive groups; and contributing to the creation of a UK-wide research participant registry of volunteers willing to take part in vaccine trials a nd other research with colleagues from the Department of Health and Social Care, the National Institute of Health Research and our counterparts from Chief Scientist Office in Scotland and Health and Care Research Wales. We are most grateful to all our partner organisatio ns with whom we were able to play our part in a highly effective response to the COVI D-19 crisis. *The clinical trials infrastructure refers to the n ecessary resources (human capital, financial suppor t, patient participants, information systems, regulato ry pathways, and institutional commitment) and the manner in which they are organised and brought toge ther to conduct a clinical trial. 31 Infection Prevention and Control During the year the PHA-led Infection prevention a nd control (IPC) Cell has continued to be an important forum for ensuring reg ional consistency of IPC practices across Northern Ireland and also for prov iding advice and guidance for organisations such as the Department of Education a nd care home providers. The PHA also has representatives on the National IPC Ce ll which ensures Northern Ireland input and influence to national guidance in cluding the development in year of 'Infection prevention and control for seasonal resp iratory infections in health and care settings (including SARS-CoV-2) for winter 202 1 to 2022' within Northern Ireland. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importanc e of IPC and therefore the PHA has commissioned work to develop a Regional IPC Framework and a Managed Care Network. This framework will be an excellent o pportunity to shape IPC practice across the HSC, improve standardisation and build c apacity of IPC Teams. We also aim to establish a Managed Care Network and this wi ll replace the current Regional IPC Cell. During the year, effective regional cluster and out break management has been undertaken by PHA Health Protection and HSC Trust I PC Teams with support from the IPC Cell. The IPC Cell has recently developed a standard operating procedure (SOP) to support Care Homes with the management of outbreaks. This outlines the actions required to be taken and will streamline th e process avoiding duplication. 32 Health Intelligence COVID-19 prompted a step change in the demand for p opulation health intelligence to inform the public, media, policymakers, health s ervice planners and researchers. Healthcare data were used to manage the direct care and contact tracing of patients, to measure the incidence and severity of COVID-19, to improve healthcare safety, to project the course of the epidemic and to address h ealth inequalities. The scale and pace of this data has continued durin g 2021/22 requiring adoption of new approaches towards work-flow, data architecture , storage, analysis and dissemination. We have used cloud-based architectur e, scheduled reports, deployed dashboards and leveraged each-others' knowledge by sharing code in an internally- hosted GitHub. We now have integrated health survei llance across routine datasets, including genomic data, following our participation in the COG-UK programme. PHA Analysts have over the course of the year been able to provide evidence about public knowledge, attitudes and behaviours associat ed with getting the COVID-19 vaccination, COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness and how mental health and social factors may influence the equity of vaccine coverag e (through work undertaken through the BSO Honest Broker Service). Direct public engagement about the use of health da ta was undertaken by the Northern Ireland Trusted Research Environment, supp orted by Health Data Research UK. The PHA participated in the HDR-funded Data and Connectivity Vaccines Pharmacovigilance research study and CO-CO NNECT project, which both featured exemplary personal and public involvement and engagement (PPIE). Our ability to deliver population-level health insi ghts at scale and speed has been greatly enhanced. 33 Population Screening Programmes Very high risk breast screening, newborn bloodspot, newborn hearing and screening for infections in pregnant women have continued uni nterrupted throughout the pandemic. All staff involved in these programmes sh ould be commended for ensuring that these critical services continued to be delivered to high standards and in a timely way during challenging times. A number of the population screening programmes wer e temporarily paused during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, so efforts in 2021/22 have focused on recovering these services and addressing the res ulting backlogs in invites. As each programme is delivered in a different way, the y have each faced different challenges in this rebuild process. The Breast Screening Programme has taken significan t steps to recovering the round length of screening (the time between screeni ng invites). While the standard is that women should be offered screening every 36 mon ths, this had stretched to 40 months by October 2020. Through the provision of ad ditional screening clinics, both in hours and out of hours, within mobile and static sites, as well as the engagement of Action Cancer to provide an additional 2,000 app ointments during 2021/22, by the end of March 2022 appointments were being offered t o women just 5 weeks over their due invite date. The Cervical Screening Programme has found it more difficult to recover backlogs due to continued pressures in primary care, laborat ories and colposcopy services. The programme continues to operate with a 5 month d elay in invitations and we will continue to keep this under close review exploring any possible opportunities to address and improve this position. The Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme, aimed at m en aged 65, has taken some time to re-establish access to all their scree ning sites and has been working through the cohort of men who were due for screenin g in 2020/21. By the end of March 2022, 97% of the 2020/21 cohort were invited for screening and it is intended that the remaining will be invited by the end of Ju ne 2022. Invitations to men within 34 the 2021/22 cohort commenced in January 2022 and PH A continues to work with the Belfast Trust to explore options for further expand ing the capacity of the service to reduce these backlogs. The Diabetic Eye Screening Programme moved rapidly to a new model of providing services at a smaller number of fixed sites rather than at individual GP practices. As capacity has been limited due to constraints such a s social distancing and infection control requirements, a two year screening interval was also introduced for those at lower risk of sight threatening retinopathy. The pr ogramme has worked extremely hard over the last 18 months to screen as many part icipants as possible, and continues to identify and secure new screening venu es across Northern Ireland to support ongoing recovery and modernisation of the p rogramme. The Bowel Cancer Screening Programme introduced a n ew test for screening in January 2021, Faecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT). One of the key benefits of FIT is that it is an easier test kit to complete and st udies elsewhere had demonstrated that moving to FIT had increased participation in s creening. After one year of FIT in Northern Ireland, and despite the ongoing challenge s of the pandemic, provisional data suggests that we are in fact seeing improvemen ts in screening uptake, which is to be welcomed and will ultimately result in more c ancers being identified and treated at an early stage. The programme continues to opera te with backlogs in invites as a result of the pause in 2020. These are being reduce d in a managed way, with the anticipation that the programme will be fully resto red by autumn 2022. The pandemic has also created opportunities to show flexibility and to explore and trial new ways of working. A long term project with the Women's Resource and Development Agency (WRDA) to promote informed choic e in cancer screening moved from face to face sessions with community gro ups to a virtually delivered service. This ensured that this important work to p romote participation in cancer screening continued successively during the pandemi c. As we now move once again to in person meetings, the mode of delivery is shif ting back again. This hybrid model of service delivery is now likely to continue into the future to better meet the needs of the target population. 35 Allied Health Professionals (AHP) Development of Post-COVID syndrome services During the year PHA AHP and Nursing teams worked in collaboration with HSCB colleagues to lead the development and implementati on of services to support patients suffering the longer terms effects of COVI D-19 (post COVID syndrome). This ensured the appropriate allocation of AHPs and nurses in the primary care- facing multi-disciplinary clinics, bespoke pulmonar y rehabilitation services and post- ICU follow up clinics. Services are now available r egionally. AHP Non-medical prescribing (NMP) education and tra ining resources Education and training resources are now available to support the ongoing continued professional development of our AHPs involved in th e management of medications. This was identified as a gap through the Regional A HP NMP forum. Online mandatory training was developed in partnership wit h the Clinical Education Centre and will be available to support over 1,300 AHPs. T he PHA has worked with colleagues in the DoH and Northern Ireland Centre f or Pharmacy Learning and Development (NICPLD) to secure access to NICPLD res ources for the 200 AHP independent and supplementary prescribers. This wil l ensure NMP AHPs are able to maintain their competencies through ongoing continu ed professional development. Promoting health and wellbeing of residents in care homes PHA AHP and Nursing teams established and led a reg ional Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) with care home activity coordinators to promote meaningful activity and social interaction in their work with residents. These ECHO sessions allow sharing of information, advice and resources and provide an opportunity for activity coordinators to meet regio nally. In year sessions have included the themes of meaningful activity in care homes; bringing music activities to people living in care home settings; Christmas acti vities; intergenerational activity ideas; Montessori approach for ageing and dementia; and healthy ageing and physical activity awareness. Engagement in meaningful activity was also promoted by developing, in partnership with occupational therapy and care home partners, a resource to support care home 36 staff to promote meaningful activity. This resource is aimed at care home staff and provides helpful tips and advice on the importance of promoting activity and selecting suitable activities. AHPs in public health The Northern Ireland AHP Public Health Group, led b y the PHA, is responsible for progressing the goals of the UK AHP Public Health S trategic Framework 2019-2024. Over the course of the last 12 months the group has focused on key areas of the UK AHP Public Health Strategic Framework to highlight and strengthen the impact of AHPs in Northern Ireland. This includes population health, preventing and reducing health inequalities, raising awareness both among A HPs and throughout the HSC of the public health role of AHPs and highlighting the impact of AHP interventions on population health and health inequalities. We also established communication networks and accessibility to resources to support AHPs in developing their public health roles and sharing best practice, representin g AHPs in wider HSC staff health and wellbeing initiatives. 37 Partnering with People - Delivering on Personal and Public Involvement (PPI) and Patient Client Experience (PC E) The PHA has continued to support cultural change wi thin the HSC so that the active involvement of and partnership working with people with lived and living experience becomes the norm. In 2021/22 the PPI team focused o n building understanding, skills, knowledge and expertise in involvement, co- production and partnership working with HSC staff, service users and carers. Some 200+ participants have now undertaken the Lead ing in Partnership programme. A number of staff were also facilitated to achieve their Certificate of Professional Development or Advanced Practitioners Certificate in Involvement and our webinar series had almost 1,000 people engaged. This is key in helping to build capacity to effect real change through meaningful i nvolvement leading to improvements in quality, safety and efficiency. In 2021/22 there was growing commitment to embeddin g PCE methodologies into care homes in Northern Ireland, reaching out to res idents, relatives and staff. This included leading in collaboration with the Patient Client Council on an online survey to inform the Executive Plan for Visiting in Care H omes. Over 1,400 returns were analysed and provided valuable insight into how to improve the experience for residents, relatives and staff. This approach ensur ed the PHA Guidance on Visiting in Care Homes was person-centred and offered a balance to delive r a safe and meaningful plan. The work in care homes continues t o grow with development of a Snapshot survey and the implementation of the Onlin e User Feedback Service (OUFS) across the care home sector to support the v oice of residents and families. In 2021/22 Public Health Agency continued to lead o n the implementation of the OUFS, Care Opinion, across the whole of the HSC. Th ere are currently over 5,000 stories collated through the service and over 150 c hanges recorded as informed by the stories. This service delivers a two way feedba ck mechanism between the author and the service and the PHA have supported thematic analysis of key areas including vaccinations, primary care, general surge ry, children and young people and maternity and neonatal, to ensure the voices impact decisions at a strategic level. 38 Health Improvement Health Improvement has developed a 'Recovery Plan' focused on short term actions (2021/22), medium term (2022-25) and long term (202 5+). The Recovery Plan is presented using a theory of ch ange approach. The plan sets out a series of outcomes we have achieved over the 2021/22 financial year and those we are planning for the next four years, incl uding whom we need to work with and the actions we will undertake to meet the desir ed outcomes. Central to implementation of the Recovery Plan this year was the need to adjust and maintain health improvement services within the con text of COVID-19 and to enhance cross agency and external partnership worki ng. Progress against the desired outcomes of the Recove ry Plan has been strong. However, our ability to deliver at the anticipated pace and scale across all 20 thematic areas has been adversely impacted over the last few months by public health guidance/regulations and redeployment of 70% of staff. Some of the highlights across the four pillars of the plan for 2021/22 financial year are: 1. STRATEGY - Influence and align the policy of others to addr ess health inequalities and the wider determinants of heath: influence the tender process for rural support net works from the Department for the Agriculture, Environment and Rur al Affairs to include health inequalities; the submission of a collective response to the Men tal Health Strategy 2021-2031 and a response to the Crisis Services Rev iew; and implementation of Nutritional Standards across hea lthcare settings. 2. SYSTEM - Enhance multi-disciplinary working across our org anisation and towards a wider health and care system: establishment of a new internal team PHA Strategic Team for Mental and Emotional Wellbeing and Suicide Prevention and comm itment from local 39 PLIGS and Drug and Alcohol Coordination Teams to wo rk on common mental health, suicide prevention and drug and alco hol issues. 3. INFRASTRUCTURE - Work in partnership to plan and deliver for the places and communities we live in, and with: preparatory work with Department of Health, PHA, E nvironmental Health and local Council representatives regarding enforce ment for new legislation relating to smoking in cars with minors and age sales of electronic cigarettes. Tobacco Control Officers (fu nded by PHA) to have joint enforcement duties alongside the Police Servi ce of Northern Ireland. 4. PEOPLE - Deliver evidence based services: Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK to mai ntain both Needle and Syringe Exchange Service and Take Home Naloxone ser vices throughout the pandemic; and all PHA mental health, emotional wellbeing and sui cide prevention services and training programmes have been maintain ed and enhanced where needed throughout the last year, making adapt ations to manage COVID restrictions / guidance where necessary. Ser vices moved on-line and via telephone, with face to face services been maintained where necessary (within COVID guidelines). This includes regional services such as Lifeline and the Self Harm Intervention Pro gramme (SHIP). Lifeline received 33,979 calls and SHIP pr ovided support for almost 3,000 individuals and carers /families. This is only a snapshot of outcomes identified by s taff leads across health improvement for the 2021/22 Recovery Plan. A schema tic of the theory of change model is provided in the table overleaf. 40 Kings Fund Population Health Model Health Improvement (HI) Recovery Plan Strategic Pillars HI Recovery Plan Strategic priorities (conditions to be met) Making Life Better Themes PHA Corporate Outcomes Societal outcomes (PfG) The wider determinates of health Strategy (policy) Influence and align the policy of others to address health inequalities Give Every Child the Best Start Equipped Throughout Life Creating the Conditions Develop Collaboration All children and young people have the best start in life.

Through the group the PHA provide s advice and support, and shares learning across the HSC. Annual Quality Report In line with the implementation of the Quality 2020 Strategy , the PHA and HSCB have continued to produce an Annual Quality Report to showcase work that improves the quality, safety and effectiveness of h ealth and social care services. The report was developed to cover a range of topics and focuses on areas of work which firstly transform the culture of our organisa tion. It highlights the PHA/HSCB safety and quality governance structures and descri bes how we have worked to create a learning culture and continue to seek new ways to improve how we learn from errors. On World Quality Day in November 2021 the report wa s launched alongside other HSC Annual Quality Reports. Launching the reports o n World Quality Day enabled the PHA/HSCB and other HSC organisations to reinfor ce the importance of reviewing our work through an 'improving quality' l ens; and it enabled us to highlight the HSC system-wide approach to improving the quali ty of health and social care. 42 Health and Social Care Quality Improvement (HSCQI) HSCQI Regional Learning System A key priority for HSCQI in 2021/22 was to make fur ther progress on the establishment a HSC Regional Learning System. This built on the 90 day learning cycle approach undertaken in 2020/21 which identifi ed three key themes, namely, Staff Psychological Wellbeing, Virtual Visiting and Virtual Consultations. HSCQI continued in partnership with the regional Ex tension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) project team to support shared learning with a focus on data and evidence for improvement through monthl y learning sessions. The evaluation summary of these is outlined below: 43 Further engagement across the HSCQI network continu ed throughout 2021/22. Informed by these discussions the HSCQI Hub team co nducted a literature review focused on learning systems to identify a robust sc ale and spread framework. The IHI Framework for Going to Full Scale (below) was p roposed and subsequently endorsed by the HSCQI Leads and the HSCQI Leadershi p Alliance. IHI Framework for going to Full Scale QI Capability HSCQI have completed a scoping exercise with HSC Tr usts to identify staff that have completed level 3 Quality Improvement programm es (aligned with the Q2020 Attributes Framework). Between January and March 20 22 HSCQI extended this scoping exercise across all PHA Directorates to obt ain baseline data which will support future planning of quality improvement trai ning and activity in the PHA. In addition the HSCQI Hub team have explored option s to facilitate the delivery of level 4 quality improvement training for Boards. Th is training will be focused on the leadership behaviours and approaches necessary to b uild safety cultures and learning systems. 44 Communications during the pandemic Communicating effectively is a core foundation of p ublic health in any context but in a pandemic it is particularly vital to ensure that information is shared at the right time to the right audience and in the most appropriate f ormat so that the population is able to understand, accept and adhere to critical p ublic health guidance. In facing the many challenges presenting throughout 2021/22, the PHA's Communications team has continued to work proactive ly with internal and external stakeholders to deliver a sustained and agile multi -channel programme of communications across all aspects of pandemic manag ement. Team members have been embedded in strategic planni ng and delivery of all elements of the Test, Trace and Protect programme, leading communication for the testing programme in Northern Ireland and promoting and explaining the role of the Contact Tracing Service. This also included targete d communications to increase uptake of testing in local communities as new varia nts emerged as well as use of apps and digital self-trace to support contact trac ing. Throughout the year a significant volume of communi cations activity was undertaken to inform, advise and influence behaviour change wi th key target audiences. This was done through the creation and delivery of multi -channel communications, including proactive issuing of news releases, handl ing extensive media enquiries, an ongoing programme of mass media advertising campaig ns, multiple publications including alternative formats - easy read, braille, ISl/BSL, translations and online information, and developing graphics and video cont ent for the agency's social media channels - Facebook (currently around a quart er of a million followers), Twitter (currently over 32,000 followers) and Insta gram (currently over 12,000 followers). In the case of the COVID-19 vaccination programme, a diverse programme of sustained communications was essential in informing and encouraging uptake, particularly when the programme was extended out to the under-50s and younger audiences. Against a crowded communications backdro p characterised by a 45 significant scale of misinformed claims and counter claims the PHA has sought to achieve cut through of its messaging by focusing on the available evidence base and promotion of authoritative commentary from leading health experts at all times. During the year it was a priority for the team to e nsure that other significant public health messaging (non-COVID-19) was advanced. We su ccessfully delivered a sustained programme of proactive messaging on a bro ad range of public health portfolios across directorate areas, helping to ens ure that people continued to be empowered and informed around looking after their h ealth and wellbeing. A total of six Living Well campaigns were delivered in over 500 community pharmacies. The campaigns included: know your limit s (alcohol); be cancer aware; boost your immunity - flu and booster vaccination; healthier choices (weight control). FAST stroke symptom awareness and portion control/h ealthy weight campaign were also delivered. PHA communications also lead in ra ising awareness and encouraging support for preventing smoking in cars and the use of nicotine inhalation products in accordance with regulations introduced February 2022. Finally, the PHA Communications programme has over the past 10 years successfully increased awareness of and support for Organ Donation in Northern Ireland. The passage of legislation by the Northern Ireland Assembly (Final Stage on 8 February 2022) and subsequent Royal Assent on 30 March 2022, which will introduce a new Opt Out system was widely welcomed across Northern Ireland and reflects positively on the role played by the PHA C ommunications and Knowledge Management team throughout. 46 New Planning Model and Population Health Planning Framework During 2021/22, the PHA has further developed a fra mework for population health planning. The framework aims to provide a practical guide of principles and actions to enable the shift towards and consistent implemen tation of population health planning. It draws on existing literature, framewor ks and Northern Ireland's experience so far and is intended as a practical gu ide to embarking on population health planning. Population health has been a key strategic directio n in Northern Ireland for many years as set out in the Programme for Government , Making Life Better Public Health Framework and Delivering Together Strategy . These documents advocate for, and recognise that, in order to have a real and lasting positive impact on improving the health and wellbeing of and reducing inequalities i n the communities we serve we must consider: the impact of and need to address health inequalit ies; the impact of the wider determinants and where we live; the need for collaboration and for whole system ap proaches; and the need for shared longer term outcomes. It is extensively documented that a shift towards p opulation health requires collaboration and coordinated efforts across a rang e of sectors and wider communities. This also means that accountability fo r population health is spread widely across sectors, organisations and communitie s and is not concentrated in single organisations or within the boundaries of tr aditional health care services. The New Planning Model for HSC is being developed w ith this in mind and is focused on population health planning, the need for collaboration and a whole system approach. Northern Ireland has many, if not all, of the requi red building blocks for a successful shift towards a collaborative population health pla nning approach. The challenge lies 47 in how we build on and join these strategies and bu ilding blocks together alongside evidence-based initiatives to create a systematic a pproach to improving population health within and across our communities. 48 Mental Health, Emotional Wellbeing and Suicide Prevention Strategic Planning Team In July 2021, the Agency Management Team agreed the development of a Strategic Planning Team (SPT) for Mental Health, Emotional We llbeing and Suicide Prevention, following submission of a joint paper f rom the Operations, Nursing and AHP and Public Health Directorates. The team, comprised of representatives from across the organisation, will work together to collaboratively plan and deliver PHA pr iorities and functions relating to mental health, emotional wellbeing and suicide prev ention and will develop a shared, collaborative, outcomes-based planning and performa nce framework that sets out the PHA's role and priorities and a clear action pl an. Mental health, emotional wellbeing and suicide prev ention are key priority areas and a major focus for the PHA. As focus turns to post-C OVID-19 rebuild and recovery and to the preparations for implementation of a new planning model; as well as the development and publication of a number of strategi es including a new Mental Health Strategy; it is important that the organisat ion has in place a connected approach across the organisation on how it plans an d implements actions to effectively address these issues in relation to men tal health, emotional wellbeing and suicide prevention. Such a collaborative planning structure will enable the organisation to work closely together across teams and create a more aligned app roach through shared priorities for mental health, emotional wellbeing and suicide prevention; combine resources effectively and demonstrate impact and outcomes in relation to achieving Corporate Strategy goals and objectives; and also show how it is contributing to delivering on the higher level outcomes set by the Northern Irela nd Executive in its Programme for Government . The aim of the team, as well as being a pilot for f uture SPTs, is to consider how PHA can work in a more connected way, harnessing skills , experience and knowledge from across the organisation and to enable more eff ective delivery of functions, 49 facilitate stronger links with other key strategic and thematic policy areas and demonstrate corporate agreement of decisions and ac tions. This approach also ensures organisational flexibility and corporate ov ersight through cross-directorate planning and delivery and will help PHA to react to external influences, prepare to support the new planning system and also to adapt t o any new PHA structure and future while continuing to deliver on key functions , duties and responsibilities. 50 Planning and Operational Services During 2021/22, Planning and Operational Services c ontinued to provide essential support to enable the Contact Tracing Service to op erate effectively. It also provided information governance expertise in assessing data protection issues linked to the sharing of personal information and the operation o f digital platforms such as the vaccine management system. Surge planning work undertaken in early 2021/22 ide ntified the need to hugely expand the Contact Tracing Service workforce to mee t forecast levels of infection. In response, in June 2021, Operations staff worked to ensure that the capacity in the existing Contact Tracing Centre was maximised and a lso prepared additional satellite offices for Contact Tracing Service staff to work from Belfast, Armagh and Londonderry. This was part of a phased expansion pl an that was developed. Additional ICT resources were procured and delivere d and workstations for the Contact Tracing Service established on the 3 rd and 4 th Floors of Linenhall Street as well as in the Towerhill and Gransha offices. The establishment of the Belfast office also allowe d the organisation to pilot a new model of contact tracing using Band 4 staff. This m odel has been operating since August 2021 and has been highly effective in provid ing additional capacity to meet the significant levels of demand for contact tracin g experienced since late June 2021. The temporary development of other satellite offices facilitated the training and redeployment of core PHA staff as well as providing increased flexibility for existing Contact Tracing Service staff. In addition to managing the expansion of the operat ional infrastructure for the Contact Tracing Service, Operations also led on the development of the business case for the Contact Tracing Service to ensure that the necessary funding was secured to support the scale and model of service r equired to meet changing demand throughout the year. During 2021/22, there continued to be a large focus on providing information governance input to support the response to COVID-1 9. Information governance 51 support to the testing service continued during the year to support colleagues expand and develop the testing programme. Also during the year the PHA become joint data cont roller with the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB), which became the Strategic Plann ing and Performance Group (SPPG) from 1 April 2022, for the personal data hel d by the COVID-19 and Flu Vaccine Management System (VMS). There was a large information governance input required to ensure the necessary arrangements were in place for managing all personal data in line with the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). PHA has also worked along with the Department of He alth (DoH) and the HSCB on the development and delivery of the COVID Certifica tion Service (CCS) and are Joint Data Controllers with DoH, and HSCB up to its migra tion to the DoH on 1 April 2022, for the personal information processed in the CCS a nd mobile App. The CCS solution provides citizens with an easily accessibl e, streamlined process for obtaining a certificate for use when providing evid ence of their COVID-19 status when required. In all instances where personal information is coll ected and processed, the necessary Privacy Notices and Data Protection Impac t Assessments (DPIAs), as required, were in place. Additionally, where sharin g of information occurs, the necessary Data Access Agreements/Data Sharing Agree ments are in place. Freedom of Information requests continue to rise si gnificantly. There have been a large number of COVID-19 related Freedom of Informa tion requests submitted this year, along with a range of other non-COVID-19 requ ests. More detail on this is provided in the section on Information Requests on page 62 of this document. These continue to be managed in line with the Freedom of Information Act 2000 . Forward Look 2022/23 Looking ahead to 2022/23, the PHA can be expected t o continue to focus a significant element of our resources on addressing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 52 and ensure that key interventions to contain and ma nage the virus, such as further roll out of the vaccination programme, targeted COV ID-19 testing, contact tracing, surveillance and public behaviour messaging are dep loyed in a proportionate and effective way and in line with emergent policy deci sions. While the PHA will continue to prioritise all actio ns necessary to effectively manage the COVID-19 pandemic it is important that in 2022/ 23 the PHA also focuses as much as possible on returning to 'business as usual ' and addressing our wider corporate priorities, such as health inequalities, which have been further exacerbated during the pandemic. Significantly, 2022/23 will see several strategic c hanges within the planning and delivery of Health and Social Care across Northern Ireland. From April 2022 the Health and Social Care Board has been replaced by a new Strategic Performance Planning Group (SPPG) under the direction of the Do H. New arrangements for the planning and commissioning of services will be stoo d up during the course of the year as a new Area Based Integrated Planning system is rolled out. The PHA will be required to engage fully to ensure we successfully optimise the potential for population health outcomes to be realised in partne rship with the wider HSC and other key bodies. At the same time there is also a need to plan how t he PHA as the strategic lead for public health in Northern Ireland needs to change, taking on board the learning from the pandemic response to date and developments acro ss health and social care and wider society, so that we ensure we have the approp riate skills, knowledge and expertise to best address the significant public he alth challenges facing Northern Ireland both now and in the future. To that end res ource will be focused on supporting the PHA/DoH review of our operating mode l and structures that commenced in the final quarter of 2021/22. 53 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REPORT The HSCB Director of Finance supports the PHA in th e delivery of its core functions, including Financial Planning, Financial Governance, Financial Management and Financial Accounting services. Financial Planning At the outset of 2021/22 it was clear that the fina ncial impact of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic would continue to necessitate agi lity in managing the resources available to the PHA. The variability of the requi red response of the changing landscape during COVID-19 and its impact on PHA's c ore business activities was closely monitored to the opening financial plan ass umptions. Looking forward into 2022/23, the ongoing response to managing the COVID-19 pandemic, inescapable cost pressures, rebuilding co sts, inflation and the 2022/23 budget settlement requires the whole HSC system to continue to work closely together to ensure that resources are prioritised a nd sound financial management continues. PHA Financial Management and Stability The PHA received a revenue resource budget \u00a3134m in 2021/22, along with income from other sources of \u00a34m and a further \u00a314m capita l funding was allocated to PHA in the year. The financial statements presented in this Annual R eport and Accounts highlight that PHA successfully delivered its breakeven duty with a small revenue surplus of \u00a394k being reported. This was achieved by significant an d diligent efforts on the part of PHA budget holders supported by the Finance Directo rate (HSCB), in managing the wide range of slippage and pressures across both Pr ogramme and Management and Administration budgets set in the backdrop of the C OVID-19 response. The following charts highlight how the PHA's revenu e funds have been utilised during 2021/22. 54 a. PHA Net Expenditure by Area 2021/22 b. Programme Expenditure by Budget Area 2021/22 \u00a339.3 M \u00a318.5 M \u00a316.3 M \u00a30.8M Commissioning Net Expenditure 2021/22 (\u00a3m) Health Improvement Health Protection Service Development & Screening Research & Development Campaigns Nursing & Allied Health Connected Health 55 COVID-19 Allocations and Expenditure During 2021/22, specific ring-fenced allocations ea rmarked for COVID-19 were allocated to the PHA from DoH. These allocations to talled \u00a313.6m which allowed the PHA to support the region in its response to the pa ndemic. This included initiatives such as the operation of the regional Contact Traci ng Centre, enhancing the level of staffing within Infection Prevention and Control Nu rsing and in Health Protection to provide ongoing support and guidance across the reg ion and to increase the level of flu vaccinations available to the public. Long Term Expenditure Trends The following chart highlights how the main categor ies of expenditure within the Statement of Comprehensive Net Expenditure (SoCNE) have moved over the last 5 years. This relates to the revenue expenditure of t he PHA. Long Term Expenditure Trends (\u00a3m) Note: 'Other' includes establishment and premises e xpenditure and other items such as depreciation. 56 The impact of the additional expenditure in respect of the PHA's COVID-19 response is largely illustrated by the increase in expenditu re levels from 2020/21 2021/22. Prompt Payment Performance a) Public Sector Payment Policy - Measure of Compli ance The Department requires that PHA pay their non HSC trade payables in accordance with applicable terms and appropriate Government Ac counting guidance. The PHA's payment policy is consistent with applicable terms and appropriate Government Accounting guidance and its measure of compliance i s: \u00a372,467 5,764 \u00a359,103 Total bills paid within 30 day target or under agreed payment terms 6,992 \u00a368,086 5,433 \u00a358,173 % of bills paid within 30 day target or under agreed payment terms 98.6% 94.0% 94.3% 98.4% Total bills paid within 10 day target 6,215 \u00a358,902 4,836 \u00a355,986 % of bills paid within 10 day target 87.7% 81 .3% 83.9% 94.7% The PHA performed well above the 95% target for pay ments within 30 days, at 98.6% (2020/21, 94.3%) and has performed well above the 70% target of payments within 10 days, at 87.7% (2021/22, 83.9%). b) The Late Payment of Commercial Debts Regulations 2002 The PHA paid no late payment fees in 2021/22 (\u00a3nil for 2020/21). 57 Sustainability - Environmental, Social and Communit y Issues The Northern Ireland Executive Sustainable Developm ent Strategy Everyone's Involved was published in May 2010, setting out a vision fo r a peaceful, fair, prosperous and sustainable society. The strategy is based on the following principles: Living within environmental limits; Ensuring a strong, healthy and just society; Achieving a sustainable economy; Promoting good governance; Using sound science responsibly; and Promoting opportunity and innovation. The PHA is committed to the principles of sustainab le development and endeavours to integrate these principles into our daily activi ties. We seek to increase awareness of sustainable development within the PHA generally and to ensure that wherever possible our overall business activities support th e achievement of sustainable development objectives. To meet these objectives we will encourage energy a nd resource efficiency in all our offices through: Working with landlords to maximise energy efficien cy where possible; reminding staff to turn of lights, computers and o ther electrical equipment when not in use; where possible reducing the amount of printing; an d as and when appropriate disseminate sustainable de velopment best practice guidelines to staff. To use our natural resources responsibly, through: using recycled materials where possible; and promoting recycling of appropriate waste. 58 To reduce our carbon footprint through how we work, in particular through: promoting the use of tele-conferencing and video-c onferencing to reduce travel; supporting the use of travel smart schemes to prom ote the use of public transport; and supporting the cycle to work scheme. Equality and Diversity During 2021/22 the PHA completed the Five Year Revi ew of Equality Scheme. The review drew on what members of Tapestry, the disabi lity network for staff working in the PHA and its 10 regional HSC partner organisatio ns, had to say about barriers they still face. It also involved input from a rang e of teams across the organisation. A number of commitments have been made as a result of the review for the next five years of Equality Scheme delivery. Facilitated by the BSO Equality Unit (who provide s upport to us on equality matters) we hold two Disability Awareness Days every year. A major achievement has been the rise in the number of participants of the days. Two days were delivered during the year: on Dementia (in December 2021) and on Att ention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (in February 2022). The days included a li ve online session with an expert in the field (a health or social care professional or an individual with lived experience of the condition). The ensuing discussion on both d ays showed a keen interest from staff who are carers of a person with a disability. Sessions are recorded and then made available on the Tapestry website. This has en sured that staff can access the session at a time convenient to them. Rural Needs Act The purpose of the Act is to ensure that public aut horities have 'due regard' to the social and economic needs of people in rural areas and to provide a mechanism for 59 ensuring greater transparency in relation to how pu blic authorities consider rural needs when developing, adopting, implementing or re vising policies, strategies and plans and when designing and delivering public serv ices. The Act seeks to help deliver fairer and more equitable treatment for peo ple in rural areas which will deliver better outcomes and make rural communities more sus tainable. The Rural Needs Act has been embedded into the PHA's processes; the completion of the Rural Needs Impact Assessments has focused minds on the i mportance of the needs of rural dwellers, so that these are considered from a n early stage in any project. The PHA has carried out a number of Rural Needs Imp act Assessments for the period 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022, as part of de signing public services. Details are included in the table below. Description of the activity undertaken by the public authority which is subject to section 1(1) of the Rural Needs Act (NI) 2016 1. The rural policy area(s) which the activity relates to 2. Describe how the public authority has had due regard to rural needs when developing, adopting, implementing or revising the policy, strategy or plan or when designing or delivering the public service 3. Bereaved by suicide project: Facilitation of support networks for people bereaved by suicide and their role in influencing policy and service delivery Broadband or Mobile Communications in Rural Areas Health of Social Care Services in Rural Areas The Bereaved by suicide co-ordination, development and facilitation project is not a service for individuals. It is a project that supports individuals bereaved by suicide to influence policy and service delivery. The project will encourage participation through bereavement groups and local protect life implementation groups which have representation from Rural Networks and Rural Support. There are no costs to participate in the project. Those that wish to participate can do so in person, by phone or by electronic means. Stakeholder involvement has been undertaken as part of the review of the project. This was carried out via an online electronic survey in line with COVID regulations and included identification of gaps and barriers in relation to the current service model. Of the 26 responses, only one comment was made in relation to the need to strengthen links in some rural areas. The PHA has also carried out a wider involvement process to determine how the Protect Life 2 Strategy actions, for which the PHA is 60 responsible, can be delivered. Through this process the following issues around rural service provision were identified; Barriers around digital access must be considered e.g. digital poverty, many do not have digital skills, smart phones or good internet connection in rural areas; conversely digital services were also highlighted as a means of helping people in rural communities to be reached with a blended approach and cross departmental working highlighted as a means of addressing barriers. Stakeholders outlined a number of user groups who require support accessing services which included rural dwellers. Additional requirements will be included within the project to ensure direct connection with Rural Networks to raise awareness of the project and to encourage participation from rural communities. Publication in relation to the project will be promoted to groups currently funded by the PHA which include rural networks and community and voluntary organisations located within rural communities. Early intervention Support Service (EISS) - Regional Family Support Service across Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Services in Rural Areas Deprivation in Rural Areas The aim of EISS is to deliver and coordinate personalised evidence based early intervention for children, young people and their families to support families when problems first emerge before the need for statutory involvement. As part of the development of EISS comprehensive stakeholder engagement was undertaken facilitated through the Children's and Young People's Strategic Partnership Outcomes Groups and Locality Planning Groups in collaboration with the Directors of Social Services within each health and social care trust locality. A lack of service provision and difficulty accessing services due to transport issues were identified in a number of rural areas. The locations and geographic spread for each EISS was agreed based on local need, emerging need and gaps in service provision. It was clear from the strategies, ongoing monitoring Information, evaluations and stakeholder involvement there is a need to continue to offer the EISS to children, young people and families in both rural and urban communities. Provider 61 organisations will be required to deliver EISS within the geographic areas identified with the aim of ensuring that children, young people and families in both urban and rural areas are supported to access the service. Providers will be required to provide links with Family Support Hubs, other community and voluntary services and others working in related areas such as drugs and alcohol, mental health etc. to ensure families have the ongoing support when their engagement with EISS is completed. Travel to rural areas in winter months and during inclement weather can on occasions cause some difficulties. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic EISS have adapted ways of delivering the service as face to face visits were not possible for a prolonged period of time. All EISS have the necessary technology to offer the EISS using a blended approach of face to face visits and virtual sessions on Zoom or Microsoft Teams. Virtual sessions will continue to be used to offer support to families on occasions when home visiting cannot be offered as an option. Maintaining the integrity and functionality of the National Breast Screening system in Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Services in Rural Areas The following issues were considered in relation to the social and economic needs of people in rural areas: Accessibility of healthcare services - the project will have neither a positive or negative impact on the accessibility of healthcare services. No change to the current service configuration is planned. Employment, training and commuting - No change to current staffing of Breast Screening Units is planned. No change to the location of Breast Screening Units is planned. Opportunities for appropriate training in the new system will be offered to all staff at their normal place of work, so no additional travel needed. All Breast Screening Units are represented in the project management structure and will contribute to the project implementation plan. 62 Complaints The PHA received 60 complaints in 2021/22, 25 of th ese were related to COVID-19 testing and 11 to the Contact Tracing service. Crit ically appraising complaints is important and strict procedures are followed. If n eeded, staff take action to ensure any lessons learned are embedded in practice to pre vent recurrences. Learning is also shared to enable others to embed this learning into their area of work. Information Requests Between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022 the followin g requests were made and responded to: 200 Freedom of Information Requests; and 7 Subject Access Requests. During the COVID-19 pandemic the PHA received a sig nificant increase in the number of Freedom of Information requests from the public. For comparison, in our 2019/20 and 2020/21 Annual Reports, we reported rec eipt of 44 and 144 Freedom of Information requests respectively, compared to the 200 requests reported in 2021/22. The majority of the Freedom of Information requests in 2021/22 related to COVID-19 (71%) but an increase in non COVID-19 rela ted requests was also noted. One personal data incident was reported to the Info rmation Commissioner's Office, in conjunction with other HSC Organisations, during 2021/22 (27 July 2021) and concerned the NI COVID Certification Service (CCS). Immediate steps were taken to stop the incident, an investigation was completed a nd measures were taken to prevent a repeat of the error. A further incident concerning payroll data processed by the BSO Payroll Service Centre (PSC) during 2021 /22 has been identified during the first weeks of April 2022. The incident was rep orted to the Information Commissioners Officer and an investigation was unde rtaken. The ICO notified BSO in May 2022 that no further action is necessary by the ICO on this occasion. 63 On behalf of the PHA, I approve the Performance Rep ort encompassing the following sections: Performance Overview.

The Permanent Secretary of the Department of Health as Principal Accounting Officer for Health and Social Care Resources in Nor thern Ireland has designated Aidan Dawson as the Accounting Officer for the Publ ic Health Agency. The responsibilities of an Accounting Officer, includin g responsibility for the regularity and 79 propriety of the public finances for which the Acco unting Officer is answerable, for keeping proper records and for safeguarding the PHA 's assets, are set out in the formal letter of appointment of the Accounting Offi cer issued by the Department of Health, Chapter 3 of Managing Public Money Northern Ireland (MPMNI) and the HM Treasury Handbook: Regularity and Propriety. As the Accounting Officer, I have taken all the ste ps that I ought to have taken to make myself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that PHA's auditors are aware of that information. So far as I am aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware . 80 GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 1. Introduction / Scope of Responsibility The Board of the Public Health Agency (PHA) is acco untable for internal control. As Accounting Officer and Chief Executive of the PHA, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal governance t hat supports the achievement of the organisation's policies, aims and objectives , whilst safeguarding the public funds and assets for which I am responsible in acco rdance with the responsibilities assigned to me by the Department of Health (DoH). As Accounting Officer, I exercise my responsibility by ensuring that an adequate system for the identification, assessment and manag ement of risk is in place. I have in place a range of organisational controls, commen surate with officers' current assessment of risk, designed to ensure the efficien t and effective discharge of PHA business in accordance with the law and Departmenta l direction. Every effort is made to ensure that the objectives of the PHA are p ursued in accordance with the recognised and accepted standards of public adminis tration. A range of processes and systems (including Service Level Agreements (SLAs), representation on PHA Board, Governance and Audit C ommittee and regular formal meetings between senior officers) are in place to s upport the close working between the PHA and its partner organisations, prim arily the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) and the Business Services Organis ation (BSO), as they provide essential services to the PHA (including th e finance function) and in taking forward the health and wellbeing agenda. Systems are also in place to support the inter-rela tionship between the PHA and the DoH, through regular meetings and by submitting regular reports. 2. Compliance with Corporate Governance Best Practi ce The Board of the PHA applies the principles of good practice in Corporate Governance and continues to further strengthen its governance arrangements. The 81 Board of the PHA does this by undertaking continuou s assessment of its compliance with Corporate Governance best practice by internal and external audits and through the operation of the Governance and Audit Committee, with regular reports to the PHA Board. The PHA Board has also completed a self-assessment against the DoH Arm's Length Bodies (ALB) Board Self-Assessment Toolkit. Overall this shows that the PHA Board functions well, and identifies progress f rom the previous year. An action plan has been developed to take forward further imp rovements. Arrangements are in place for an annual declaration of interests by all PHA Board Members and staff; the register is publically avail able on the PHA website. Members are also required to declare any potential conflict of interests at Board or committee meetings, and withdraw from the meeting w hile the item is being discussed and voted on. 3. Governance Framework The key organisational structures which support the delivery of good governance in the PHA are: PHA Board; Governance and Audit Committee; and Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee. The PHA Board is comprised of a Non-Executive Chair , seven Non-Executive members, the Chief Executive and four Executive Dir ectors. During 2021/22, the PHA Board met on eleven occasio ns. The PHA Board meets regularly, usually monthly, with the exception of J uly. The Board sets the strategic direction for the PHA within the overall policies a nd priorities of the HSC, monitors performance against objectives, ensures effective f inancial stewardship, ensures that high standards of corporate governance are mai ntained, ensures systems are 82 in place to appoint, appraise and remunerate senior executives, ensures effective public engagement and ensures that robust and effective arrangements are in place for clinical and social care governanc e and risk management. All Board meetings were quorate.

The GAC has an in tegrated governance role encompassing financial governance, clinical and soc ial care governance and organisational governance, all of which are underpi nned by risk management systems. The GAC meets at least quarterly and curre ntly comprises of four Non- Executive Directors and is supported by the PHA's I nterim Director of Operations and the HSCB's Director of Finance. Representatives from Internal and External Audit are also in attendance. During 2021/22 the GA C met on five occasions and all meetings were quorate. The Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee adv ises the PHA Board about appropriate remuneration and terms of service for t he Chief Executive and other senior executives subject to the direction of the D oH. The Committee also oversees the proper functioning of performance appraisal sys tems, the appropriate contractual arrangements for all staff as well as m onitoring a remuneration strategy that reflects national agreement and Departmental P olicy and equality legislation. The Committee comprises the PHA Chair and three Non -Executive Directors; it normally meets at least once every 6 months. Dur ing 2021/22, the Committee met on two occasions and the meetings were quorate. 4. Framework for Business Planning and Risk Managem ent Business planning and risk management is at the hea rt of governance arrangements to ensure that statutory obligations a nd ministerial priorities are properly reflected in the management of business at all levels within the organisation. The PHA Corporate Plan 2017 - 2021 , setting out the PHA purpose, vision, values and strategic outcomes, was approved by the PHA Boa rd on 20 April 2017 and by the DoH on 26 May 2017. This was rolled forward in to 2021/22 as advised by the Department of Health (DoH), in line with governance processes required during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Annual Business Plan 2021/2 2, which sets out the actions to be taken forward in the PHA Corporate Pl an, taking account of DoH 84 guidance and priorities, was approved by the PHA Bo ard on 17 June 2021. Both documents were developed with input from the PHA Bo ard and staff from all Directorates and engagement with external stakehold ers. The PHA's Risk Management Strategy and Policy expli citly outlines the PHA risk management process which is a 5 stage approach - ri sk identification, risk assessment, risk appetite, addressing risk and reco rding and reviewing risk, as follows: Stage 1 - Risk Identification Risks are identified in a number of ways and at all levels within the organisation corporately, by Directorate and by individual staff members. Risks can present as external factors which impact on the organisation b ut which the organisation may have limited control over or operational which conc ern the service provided and the resources/processes available and utilised. Withi n the organisation risk identification is related to the organisation's obj ectives (as detailed in the PHA Corporate Plan). Each risk identified is correlated to at least one of the corporate objectives. Risks are also aligned with the relevan t performance and assurance dimensions as identified in the DoH Framework Docum ent. Stage 2 - Risk Assessment Each risk is assessed to identify: The impact that the risk would have on the business should it occur, and The likelihood of the risk materialising. The PHA is committed to adhering to best practice i n the identification and treatment of risks and works to the principles, fra mework and processes for Risk Management as contained in ISO 31000: 2018 and also adheres to the HSC Regional Risk Matrix (April 2013; updated June 2016 and August 2018). 85 Stage 3 - Risk Appetite The PHA carefully considers its risk appetite, i.e. the extent of exposure to risk that is judged tolerable and justifiable. The PHA recogn ises that it is operating in an environment where safety, quality and viability are paramount and are of mutual benefit to service users, stakeholders and the orga nisation alike. Consequently, and subject to controls and assurances being in place, the PHA will generally accept manageable risks which are innovative and which pre dict clearly identifiable benefits, but not those where the risk of harm or a dverse outcomes to service users, the PHA's business viability or reputation i s significantly high and may outweigh any benefits to be gained. Risk appetite i s built into the risk assessment process as outlined above. Stage 4 - Addressing the Risk Whilst there are four traditional responses to addr essing risk (terminate, tolerate, transfer and treat), in practice within the PHA the vast majority of risks are managed via the \"Treat\" or \"Tolerate\" route, both of which are underpinned by the identification of an action plan to reduce and, if possible, eliminate the risk. Stage 5 - Recording and Reviewing Risk Within the PHA the risk management process is recor ded and evidenced through the maintenance of Directorate and Corporate level Risk Registers. To ensure the robustness of the PHA's system of int ernal control, fully functioning Risk Registers at both Directorate and Corporate le vels are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis, ensuring that risks are manag ed effectively and efficiently to meet PHA's corporate objectives and to continuously improve the quality of services. Processes are established within each Directorate e nabling risks to be identified, controls and/or gaps in controls highlighted and, w here relevant, action to be taken to mitigate the risk. Directors and senior officers also identify risks which require 86 escalation to the Corporate Risk Register. The Interim Director of Operations is the PHA Execu tive Board member with responsibility for risk management. The Corporate R isk Registers are reviewed quarterly by the Agency Management Team (AMT) and G overnance and Audit Committee (GAC). Directorate Risk Registers are als o reviewed by AMT and the GAC on a rotational basis. The minutes of the GAC a re brought to the following PHA Board meeting, and the Chair of the GAC also pr ovides a verbal update on governance issues including risk. The Corporate Ris k Register is brought to a PHA Board meeting at least annually, most recently on 1 7 June 2021. During 2021/22, guidance and support was provided to staff who are actively involved in reviewing and co-ordinating the review of the Directorate and Corporate Risk Registers. A system has been established where by the Senior Operations Manager meets with the planning and project manager s supporting each Directorate and Division at the end of each quarter to ensure feedback and consistency in the review of the Risk Registers, an d to share and learn from good practice. All staff are required to complete the PHA risk man agement e-learning programme. In addition, staff have also been provided with oth er relevant training including fire, health and safety, security and fraud awareness. All policies and procedures in respect of risk mana gement and related areas are available to all staff through the PHA intranet (Co nnect) site. 5. Information Risk The PHA has robust measures in place to manage and control information risks. The designated Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) for the management of information risk at Board level is the Interim Dire ctor of Operations. The Interim Director of Public Health as the Personal Data Guar dian (PDG) has responsibility for ensuring that the PHA processes satisfy the hig hest practical standards for handling personal data. Assistant Directors as Info rmation Asset Owners (IAOs) are 87 responsible for managing and addressing risks assoc iated with the information assets within their function and provide assurance to the SIRO on the management of those assets. The Interim Assistant Director of Planning and Operational Services as the Data Protection Officer (DPO) has r esponsibility for monitoring and advising on data protection. The PHA's Information Governance Steering Group (IG SG) has the primary role of leading the development and implementation of the I nformation Governance Framework across the organisation, including ensuri ng that action plans arising from Internal and External Audit reports and the In formation Management Checklist are progressed. The Group is chaired by the SIRO an d membership includes all the IAOs, PDG, a Non-Executive Board member and relevan t governance staff. The IGSG is scheduled to meet three times per year and provides a report to the GAC following each meeting. During 2021/22 the IGSG met twice due to COVID-19 pressures faced by staff and a meeting to report th e year end position will take place in the first quarter of the 2022/23 year. The PHA's Information Governance Strategy (incorpor ating the Information Governance Framework) 2018-2022 sets out the framew ork to ensure that the PHA meets its obligations in respect of information gov ernance, embedding this at the heart of the organisation and driving forward impro vements in information governance within the PHA. The Strategy was reviewe d and approved in 2018 in line with UK GDPR and DPA 2018. This is supported b y annual Action Plans setting out how it will be implemented. Alongside this, a r ange of policies and procedures are in place, including Data Protection/Confidentia lity Policy, Data Breach Incident Response Policy and a Data Protection Impact Assess ment Policy and Guidance. The PHA has documented and agreed procedures in pla ce to ensure compliance with the requirements of UK GDPR and DPA 2018. The PHA 'Connect' intranet site provides staff with easy access to the latest PHA policies, news and resources. Through the use of th is site the PHA ensures that all staff have access to information governance policie s and procedures. 88 Information asset registers are in place, and are k ept under review. Information risks are assessed and control measures are identif ied and reviewed as required. Where appropriate, information risks are incorporat ed in the Corporate or Directorate Risk Registers. The HSC information governance e-learning programme , incorporating Freedom of Information, Data Protection, Records Management an d IT Security/cyber security continues to be rolled out to all staff. Specialise d training is also organised for the SIRO and IAOs however, during 2021/22, no training sessions took place due to COVID-19 pressures faced by staff within PHA. Duri ng this time staff were supported by the IG team. Uptake of training is m onitored by the IGSG. The PHA is represented on the regional HSC Cyber Se curity Programme Board, and works with BSO ITS, as our IT provider, to take nec essary measures in relation to cyber security risks. One personal data incident was reported to the Info rmation Commissioner's Office, in conjunction with other HSC Organisations, during 2021/22 (27 July 2021) and concerned the NI COVID Certification Service (CCS). Immediate steps were taken to stop the incident, an investigation was completed a nd measures were taken to prevent a repeat of the error. A further incident concerning payroll data processed by the BSO Payroll Service Centre (PSC) during 2021 /22 has been identified during the first weeks of April 2022. The incident was rep orted to the Information Commissioners Officer and an investigation was unde rtaken. The ICO notified BSO in May 2022 that no further action is necessary by the ICO on this occasion. 6. Fraud The Public Health Agency (PHA) takes a zero toleran ce approach to fraud in order to protect and support our key public services. We have put in place an Anti-Fraud and Anti-Bribery Policy and Response Plan, which wa s updated during 2021/22, to outline our approach to tackling fraud, define staf f responsibilities and the actions to be taken in the event of suspected or perpetrated f raud, whether originating internally or externally to the organisation. Our F raud Liaison Officer promotes fraud 89 awareness, co-ordinates investigations in conjuncti on with the BSO Counter Fraud and Probity Services team and provides advice to pe rsonnel on fraud reporting arrangements. All staff are supported in fraud awar eness in respect of the Anti- Fraud Policy and Fraud Response plan, which are kep t under review and updated as appropriate. A fraud report is brought to the GAC on a regular b asis. 7. Public Stakeholder Involvement In the HSC there is a statutory duty to Involve and Consult and there are Personal and Public Involvement (PPI) policy responsibilitie s for which the PHA carries leadership responsibilities. In 2021/22 the PPI te am focussed on building understanding, skills, knowledge and expertise in I nvolvement, Co-Production and Partnership Working with HSC staff, service users a nd carers. Some 200+ participants have now undertaken the Leading in Par tnership programme. A number of staff were also facilitated to achieve their Cer tificate of Professional Development or Advanced Practitioners Certificate in Involvemen t and our webinar series had almost 1,000 people engaged. The PHA has continued to support cultural change wi thin the HSC, to one where the active involvement of and partnership working with people with lived and living experience is the norm. In 2021/22 Public Health Ag ency continued to lead on the implementation of the Online User Feedback Survey, Care Opinion, across the whole of the HSCNI. There are currently over 5000 s tories collated through the service and over 150 changes recorded as informed b y the stories. The PHA recognises that PPI is core to the effectiv e and efficient commissioning, design, delivery and evaluation of HSC services. PP I is the active and meaningful involvement of service users, carers and the public in those processes. In commissioning services, PHA actively considers PPI in all aspects of the commissioning process, ensuring that the input of s ervice users and carers underpins the identification of commissioning prior ities; in the development of service models and service planning; and in the evaluation and monitoring of service 90 changes or improvements. The PHA is also cognisant of recent policy developm ents in this wider area; the 'Co- Production Guide for Northern Ireland - Connecting and Realising Value through People ' (DoH, 2018) a practical guide, available at www.health-ni.gov.uk , to a co-production approach across the health and social care system. The guide was developed as part of the DoH's programme of work to transform he alth and social care as envisaged in 'Delivering Together 2026'. 8. Assurance The Governance and Audit Committee provides an assu rance to the Board of the PHA on the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls in operation within the PHA. It assists the PHA Board in the discharge of its functions by providing an independent and objective review of : all control systems; the information provided to the PHA Board; compliance with law, guidance, Code of Conduct and Code of Accountability; and governance processes within the PHA Board. Internal and External Audit have a vital role in pr oviding assurance on the effectiveness of the system of internal control. Th e GAC receives reviews and monitors reports from Internal and External Audit. Internal and External Audit representatives are also in attendance at all GAC m eetings. The Chair of the GAC reports to the PHA Board on a regular basis on the work of the Committee. The PHA Board also receives regular assurances through the financial and performance reports brought to it by the HSCB Director of Finance and PHA Interim Director of Operations. The PHA Assurance Framework sets out a systematic a nd comprehensive 91 reporting framework to the Board and its committees and is normally reviewed twice yearly. However, following a review of the Assuran ce Framework by the GAC in April 21, it was agreed that fuller discussions sho uld take place regarding the Framework and it is considered as part of a wider r eview of all PHA Board Performance Reporting processes, which will be comp leted by September 2022. The PHA continues to ensure that data quality assur ance processes are in place across the range of data coming to the PHA Board. W here gaps are identified, the PHA proactively seeks to address these, for example by the development and regular review of the Programme Expenditure Monitor ing System (PEMS) to ensure comprehensive and robust information. Information presented to the PHA Board to support d ecision making, is firstly presented to, and approved by, the Agency Managemen t Team (AMT) and the Chief Executive, as part of the quality assuran ce process. Relevant officers are also in attendance at Board meetings when appropria te, to ensure that members have the opportunity to challenge information prese nted. The PHA has in place an effective whistleblowing po licy based on the HSC Whistleblowing Framework and Model Policy, develope d in collaboration with the DoH and HSC organisations in response to the recomm endations arising from the RQIA Review of the Operation of HSC Whistleblowing arrangements 2016. 9. Sources of Independent Assurance The PHA obtains Independent Assurance from the foll owing sources: Internal Audit Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQI A) In addition, the PHA receives an opinion on regular ity from the External Auditor in the Report to Those Charged with Governance. 92 Internal Audit The PHA utilises an Internal Audit function which o perates to defined standards and whose work is informed by an analysis of the ri sk to which the body is exposed and annual audit plans are based on this an alysis. In 2021/22 Internal Audit reviewed the following systems: System reviewed Level of Assurance* Financial Review Satisfactory - Non Pay Expenditure, Budgetary Control and Financial Reporting to the Board Limited - Payments to Staff Recruitment of Vaccinators Satisfactory Performance Management Limited Serious Adverse Incidents 1 Limited Board Effectiveness Limited 1 Joint HSCB and PHA audit * Internal Audit's definition of levels of assuranc e: Satisfactory : Overall there is a satisfactory system of governa nce, risk management and control. While there may be some residual risk identified, t his should not significantly impact on the achievement of system objectives. Limited : There are significant weakness within the governa nce, risk management and control framework which, if not addressed, could lead to th e system objectives not being achieved. Unacceptable: The system of governance, risk management and contr ol has failed or there is a real and substantial risk that the system will fail to meet its objectives. Limited Internal Audit Reports - Summary of Finding s/Recommendations Financial Review The internal audit opinion in respect of this repor t was split. Satisfactory assurance was provided in respect of Non Pay Expenditure, Bud getary Control and Financial Reporting to the Board processes but a limited assu rance was provided in relation to Payments to staff. The limited assurance was pro vided on the basis that issues were identified in relation to additional payments, largely relating to additional hours worked during the COVID-19 response. New starts, l eavers and contract changes were not processed on a timely basis, resulting in over and underpayments. 93 There were no Priority 1 recommendations made in th is report and seven of the eight priority 2 recommendations are planned to be implem ented by June 2022. Performance Management The internal audit opinion in respect of this repor t was limited. Limited assurance was provided on the basis that a formally defined p erformance management framework is not in place and a comprehensive perfo rmance report was not presented to the Agency Board. In addition, Key P erformance Indicators have not been developed and measured against for new service areas of PHA, for example Contact Tracing. There were 1 priority one and 1 priority two recomm endations made in this report. Some actions have already been implemented in relat ion to the priority one recommendation and all remaining recommendations ar e due for implementation by 30 June 2022. Serious Adverse Incidents The internal audit opinion in respect of this repor t was limited. The limited assurance was provided on the basis that significan t issues were identified in relation to the Serious Adverse Incident processes within the HSCB and PHA. In particular, internal audit findings highlighted that HSCB and PHA do not have a joint accountability mechanism in place to ensure e ach partner delivers their respective responsibilities. Also, delays in the d issemination of learning documentation and the cancellation of professional group meetings to consider serious adverse incident reports were highlighted b y internal audit. The lack of a detailed Annual Quality report to the PHA Board and also the need to take forward the Joint Improvement Plan to improve Serious Adver se Incident processes across PHA and HSCB were also noted. There were no Priority 1 recommendations made in th is report and of the six priority 2 recommendations two have already been im plemented and the remaining recommendations are due for implementatio n by October 2022. 94 Board Effectiveness The internal audit opinion in respect of this repor t was limited as at the time of the audit fieldwork (November 2021). The limited assura nce primarily related to a need to improve understanding of, and working betwe en, Executive/Non Executive roles and to improve performance management and oth er reporting to the Board. Internal Audit have noted that the issues leading t o a Limited assurance opinion in November 2021 have largely been addressed in the in terim period up to March 2022 however, whilst recognising the improvements, Internal Audit was of the view that there is a need, with time, to embed and conso lidate Board working relationships / collaboration further. Follow Up on Previous Recommendations The Internal Audit Follow Up report on previous Int ernal Audit Recommendations, issued on 5 April 2022, found that of the 59 recomm endations with an implementation date of 31 March 2022 or earlier, 78 % (46 recommendations) were fully implemented and 22% (13 recommendations) were partially implemented. Work will continue during 2022/23 to address those recommendations that have not yet been fully implemented. 2 priority one weaknesses in control remain outstan ding: PHA Management of Contracts with the Voluntary/Com munity Sector audit, relating to the implementation of the PHA Social Ca re Procurement Plan; and Performance management systems at a corporate leve l. Both recommendations have been partially implemente d; however during the year progress was limited due to the re-prioritisat ion of staff to focus on the COVID-19 pandemic response. Work will continue in the 2022/23 year to fully address these recommendations. BSO Shared Services Audits A number of audits (summarised below) have been con ducted in BSO Shared 95 Services, as part of the BSO Internal Audit Plan. T he recommendations in these Shared Services audit reports are the responsibilit y of BSO Management to take forward and the reports have been presented to BSO Governance and Audit Committee. System reviewed Level of Assurance received Payroll Service Centre (PSC) Satisfactory - Elementary PSC processes Limited - End-to-End Manual Timesheet Processing, SAP / HMRC RTI Reconciliation Accounts Receivable Satisfactory Recruitment Shared Service Centre (RSC) Satisfactory - RSSC Processing Activities Limited - HSC Recruitment processes * Regional Interpreting Service Satisfactory Accounts Receivable Shared Service Satisfactory * It is appreciated that the HSC Recruitment proces s, and therefore this assurance, is outside BSO's sole responsibility and is relevant to all HSC orga nisations. Overall Opinion In her Annual Report, the Head of Internal Audit pr ovided the following opinion on the PHA's system of internal control: Overall for the year ended 31 March 2022, I can pro vide satisfactory assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of the organisation' s framework of governance, risk management and control. However I would highlight that Limited assurance has been provided in a considerable proportion of audit s during the current financial year. I am satisfied that prompt Management action has al ready been taken in response to the significant matters raised in the Board Effecti veness and Performance Management audit reports in particular. All of the Limited assurances provided in 2021/22 are related at least in part, to the impact of COVID-19 on PHA operations and the organisation's focus on the COVID-19 respon se. In 2022/23, I advise PHA to address the remaining outstanding audit recommen dations and ensure Management focus is maintained on key governance, r isk and control processes across the core functions of the organisation. RQIA The HSCB/PHA has in place a Regional Safety and Qua lity Alerts Procedure which oversees the identification, co-ordination, dissemi nation and assurance on 96 implementation of regional learning issued by the H SCB/PHA/DoH/RQIA and other independent/regulatory bodies. Once a Safety and Qu ality Alert (SQA) has been issued to Arm's Length Bodies (ALBs) it is the resp onsibility of the HSCB/PHA to ensure adequate responses on assurances to the acti ons specified within relevant SQAs have been implemented accordingly. This proces s is overseen by relevant directors within the HSCB and PHA by way of weekly Safety Brief Meetings. External Audit For the year ended 31 March 2021, the Comptroller a nd Auditor General gave an unqualified audit opinion, without modification, on the financial statements. No findings were identified during the course of the a udit and no recommendations were made. 10. Review of Effectiveness of the System of Intern al Governance As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for th e review of effectiveness of the system of internal governance. My review of the eff ectiveness of the system of internal governance is informed by the work of the Internal Auditors and the executive managers within the PHA who have responsi bility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework, and comments made by the External Auditors in their management letter and other repor ts. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effe ctiveness of the system of internal control by the Governance and Audit Committee and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement to the system is in place. 11. Internal Governance Divergences a) Update on prior year control issues which have n ow been resolved and are no longer considered to be control issues Neurology Call Back Due to concerns being raised in relation to the pra ctice of a consultant neurologist at the Belfast Trust including work he undertook on be half of other Trusts and in 97 relation to his private practice, the HSCB and PHA, at the direction of the DoH, established a regional Coordination Group (which in cluded Trust representatives and relevant independent sector providers) to co-ordina te the work necessary to complete a call-back review of those patients who r emained under active review of the consultant (phase 1). This was followed by two call-backs of a defined cohorts of patients who had been seen by the consultant and wh ose care was subsequently returned to primary care (phases 2 and 3). The PHA has worked closely with the HSCB, Trusts an d independent providers to ensure that a consistent approach has been taken re lating to the call back and review of patients who may be affected including pr oviding consistent situation reports to the DoH on activity and progress. This work is now largely completed with: Phase 1 of the call-back exercise was completed in 2018 and a report on the activity and outcomes associated with Phase 1 was p ublished. Phase 2 was completed in October 2019 and a report on the activity and outcomes associated with Phase 2 was published. Phase 3 of the call-back was completed in 2021 and a report has been submitted to the DoH in early 2022. This has yet to be publi shed. Cyber Security Incident at Queens University Belfas t A cyber security incident took place at Queens Univ ersity Belfast (QUB) in February 2021. As the HSC has multiple contractual interact ions with QUB, some concerning personal information, the HSC technology teams, wit h the backing of the HSC SIROs, took a number of actions to reduce potential disruption to HSC services, and continue to liaise with QUB on the impact of the cy ber incident. The impact on the HSC was fully investigated as described below. Following the incident, HSC Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) and BSO progressed actions with supplier/partner organisati ons since the cyber-attack. These focused on: 98 1. Seeking assurance on the technical efforts being made by QUB to \"harden\" their defences and bring them to a level which would give sufficient confidence to HSC of the infrastructure and technical defences, inclu ding the training and awareness of staff. 2. Mapping and recording data flows between the org anisation affected, and the HSC, on an organisation-by-organisation basis. See king information on the measures being taken by the Supplier/partner to ass ure the security of HSC patient or client information held in partner/suppl ier systems, and determining what proof exists of a data breach due to the exfil tration of patient data from their systems during the cyber-attack. 3. Agreeing a protocol that all HSC organisations w ill use going forward, in order to restore data flows and technical connections throug h a risk-managed process, with the agreement of all HSC SIROs. 4. Bringing forward a revised corporate risk throug h Trust governance processes, which recognises the risk of an Information securit y breach through a supplier/partner cyber-attack. This will enable th e mitigation measures to be described and the risk appetite of organisations to be considered through corporate processes. HSC SIROs, BSO and lead officers in the cyber progr amme regionally met regularly throughout this process, to consider the position o n the impact to the HSC and to the restriction of our transfer of information to/from QUB. There was specific and detailed attention paid to the mitigation actions carried ou t to QUB and to the root cause analysis. On the basis of this information, and the assessed position, it was agreed that HSC SIROs would recommend a restoration of network conn ections with QUB, and that services should fully resume, subject to ongoing mo nitoring of the position with QUB through contract monitoring processes. All services were reconnected on 8 July 2021. 99 As work on this internal control divergence has com pleted no further action is required. b) Update on prior year control issues which contin ue to be considered control issues Financial Performance While the budget for Health and Social Care in Nort hern Ireland continues to be challenging and set in the context of managing sign ificant additional financial pressures relating to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the PHA approved a financial plan in June 2021 on its financial positi on and direct resources. Financial performance has largely remained in line with this plan during the financial year and PHA achieved a breakeven financial position in 2021 /22. Budget Position and Authority: The Assembly passed the Budget Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 in March 2022 which authorised the ca sh and use of resources for all departments and their Arms' Length Bodies for the 2 021-22 year, based on the Executive's final expenditure plans for the year. T he Budget Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 also included a Vote on Account which authoris ed departments' and their Arms' Length Bodies' access to cash and use of reso urces for the early months of the 2022-23 financial year. The cash and resource b alance to complete for the remainder of 2022-23 will be authorised by the 2022 -23 Main Estimates and the associated Budget Bill based on an agreed 2022-23 B udget. In the event that this is delayed, then the powers available to the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance under Section 59 of the Northern Ireland Ac t 1998 and Section 7 of the Government Resources and Accounts Act (Northern Ire land) 2001 will be used to authorise the cash, and the use of resources during the intervening period. Budget Forward position: Following the resignation of the First Minister and the subsequent lack of an Executive, a Budget for 2022- 23 could not be finalised. The Finance Minister wrote to departments to set out a way forward in the absence of an Executive to agree a Budget. This process involved DoF issuing departments with contingency planning envelopes for the 2022-23 fina ncial year. These envelopes provided departments with an assessment of the mini mum funding they could 100 reasonably expect for 2022-23 and allowed departmen ts to plan for expenditure until such times as a Budget could be agreed. An approach has been agreed with the Minister to en able opening allocations to proceed to continue to fund activity at current lev els in 2022/23 while controlling spending in line with the advice from the Finance M inister. However there remains a great deal of uncertainty on the future financial p osition. The Department's reliance on significant levels of non-recurrent funding in r ecent years means that we are expecting to face an extremely challenging financia l outlook. While we are anticipating significant allocations for Health onc e a Budget is agreed the 2022/23 budget will continue to require careful managing in order to develop a break even position. Management of Contracts with the Community and Volu ntary Sector Previous Internal Audit reports on the management o f health and social wellbeing improvement contracts have provided satisfactory as surance on the system of internal controls over PHA's management of health a nd social wellbeing contracts reflecting the significant work that has been under taken by the PHA. Service Level Agreements are in place, appropriate monitoring arr angements have been developed and payments are only released on approva l of previous progress returns. During 2021/22 we reviewed contract activ ity and agreed revised performance measures based on individual organisati ons ability to continue to deliver core services or re-purpose their resources to support wider emergency response plans. PHA has also highlighted to provide rs their legal duty to ensure they did not access duplicate funding under the Furlough scheme or other grant schemes available to cover costs already covered by PHA fun ding. An audit of the processes put in place to manage the COVID-19 response identi fied no significant issues. Work continues to fully address the partially imple mented priority one weakness in control relating to the implementation of the PHA S ocial Care Procurement Plan. PHA's ability to continue to implement the Procurem ent Plan since March 2020, has however been significantly impacted by the need to prioritise staffing resources to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. 101 During 2021/22, the PHA Procurement Board has conti nued to progress plans for the re-tender of Drug and Alcohol services and Rela tionship and Sexual Education services as far as possible given the limitations r esulting from the need to prioritise the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following an engagement exercise with stakeholders on the Drug and Alcohol re- tender process the PHA and DoH agreed a delay to th e procurement exercise to ensure maximum alignment with both the new regional Drug and Alcohol strategy launched by the Minister in September 2021 and ongo ing work in regard to the commissioning of mental health and suicide preventi on support services linked to the delivery of the Protect Life 2 strategy. Further implementation of the report of a Task and Finish Group established to review how the PHA could improve its planning and p rocurement processes has been delayed due to COVID-19. Two new senior planni ng posts appointed to provide additional specialist capacity to support planning for procurement have been re- directed temporarily to support the Contact Tracing service. Implementation of the recommendations remains a priority for the PHA and will be addressed when appropriate staff have the capacity to take forward this work. The PHA will continue to work closely with colleagu es in SPPG (DOH), BSO (Directorate of Legal Services and Procurement and Logistics service), HSC Trusts and the DoH, to ensure that procurement processes c ontinue to meet regional policy and guidance. PHA Staffing Issues The PHA has continued to work closely with DoH coll eagues to take actions to address the number of vacancies and posts filled on a temporary basis across all Directorates and at all levels of the organisation. It has been noted that budget reductions over the past number of years and on-goi ng budget constraints have curtailed the ability to further develop and grow t he workforce to meet new and 102 increasing demands. This has impacted on the work of the PHA through constrained capacity across a number of key areas and functions . While significant progress was made during 2020/21 to address staffing issues, most notably with the appointment of new Health Protecti on and Nursing/AHP staff and measures to recruit permanent staff to fill health improvement posts currently filled on a temporary basis it is recognised that some lon ger term actions are still required. This was highlighted in the report on the 'Rapid, f ocused external review of the Public Health Agency's resource requirement to resp ond to the COVID-19 pandemic over the next 18 - 24 months' conducted by Dr R Hus sey, December 2020. The DoH has since confirmed that a review of the PHA wi ll be undertaken beginning in 2022 and it is anticipated that an initial report w ill be completed by the end of June 2022. It is envisaged that this will produce a num ber of recommendations influencing the future operating model of the Agenc y and its staffing complement. The impact of COVID-19 on resourcing PHA's normal o perational business was also seen though the findings of Internal Audit in areas such as Serious Adverse Incidents and Performance Management reporting. Additionally there has been significant change in t he PHA senior management team over the past year, with one permanent and two inte rim appointments (Chief Executive, Director of Operations (Interim) and Dir ector of Public Health (Interim)). The new Chief Executive took up post in July 2021. PHA will continue to work with DoH colleagues to pr ogress these issues. COVID-19 The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the ou tbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. Foll owing which the Department of Health and its ALBs immediately enacted emergenc y response plans across the NI Health sector. There is a UK-wide coordinated ap proach guided by the scientific and medical advice from respective Chief Medical Of ficers and Chief Scientific Advisers informed by the emergent evidence national ly and internationally. 103 Evidence-based UK-wide policies and guidelines cont inue to be carefully followed in conjunction with the PHA issuing local guidelines a nd ensuring readily accessible and continually updated advice. The pandemic has had extensive impact on the health of the population, all health services and the way business is conducted across t he public sector. Protecting the population, particularly the most vulnerable, ensur ing that health and social care services are not overwhelmed, saving lives through mitigating the impact of the pandemic and patient and staff safety has remained at the forefront throughout the emergency response. Contingency arrangements were activated across all HSC organisations, including the PHA. Given the broad impact of COVID-19 and the need to react quickly to changing circumstances e.g. new variants and mainta in a sustained pandemic response, this has impacted on the ability of the P HA to conduct core health business as resources were redirected to deal with the pandemic. In line with the Government advice to work from home where possible to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, the majority of staff have been working r emotely for most of the year. There has been a substantial resourcing impact acro ss the Department and ALBs to scale up the response and to ensure adequate staff resourcing to meet increasing demands which included calling on volunteers, retir ed medical staff and medical students to rally together to strive to enable an o ptimum response to the pandemic. In the case of the PHA, additional temporary and fu lltime staff had to be recruited to operate the contact tracing service and to enhance the health protection team to respond to the pandemic. The Department prepared a COVID-19 Test, Trace and Protect Strategy (May 2020) which sets out the public health approach to minimi sing COVID-19 transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The Department continues to have responsibility for oversight of the operation of the various eleme nts of this Strategy. The Strategy includes the COVID-19 testing arrangem ents. The Department's Expert Advisory Group chaired by the PHA has overse en the strategic approach in 104 NI, working with the UK Coronavirus National Testin g Programme. PHA staff have worked closely with Departmental colleagues as part of both the strategic and operational management of the testing programme. The Northern Ireland Contact Tracing Service, opera ted by the PHA, started contact tracing all confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 18 May 2 020. This is a seven day service which has adapted to changing circumstances as it strives to ensure that every effort is made to limit transmission and prot ect the population. During each wave of the pandemic PHA staff are redeployed to he lp in contact tracing in order to provide a timely response to cases. In December 2020, the first COVID-19 vaccine was ap proved, with supplies received in Northern Ireland and the mass vaccination progra mme (for all adults) commenced. The COVID-19 vaccination programme is led by the De partment of Health and delivered by both HSC Trusts and primary care (gene ral practice and pharmacy). The PHA is represented on the programme board and i mplementation group, with responsibilities including the management of a sess ional COVID-19 vaccinator workforce to support primary care. PHA is leading on the vaccination of the 12-15 year age group and, in due, course will assume over responsibility for the COVID vaccination programmes (i.e. in common with other e xisting population immunisation/vaccination programmes, such as MMR, s easonal flu, etc). It is anticipated that community transmission of CO VID-19 will continue for the next 12 to 18 months. The pandemic response has require d PHA to develop new services like 7 day contact tracing service, co-ord inate testing, increase communication with general public to ensure public awareness and engagement with core public health guidance, contribute to the vacc ination programme and mobilise the pandemic response in all Directorates in the PH A. This will continue to be a focus and a challenge in 2022/23, as the organisati on will also start to return to core business in the coming months. However, going forwa rd into 2022/23, there is some uncertainty as to the direction of government polic y (i.e. given the general intention of 'living with COVID'). This will have implication s for PHA actions in terms of almost all COVID-related measures referred to in this docu ment. 105 HSCQI The establishment of the HSCQI function, in April 2 019, was a key action from 'Health and Wellbeing 2026: Delivering Together'. The DoH established the HSCQI within the PHA, providing temporary funding through transformation monies for the Director of HSCQI and a number of additional posts. (The Safety Forum, already within the PHA, also became part of the new HSCQI D irectorate.) The budget allocation for 2021/22 included funding for some HSCQI posts, however it does not cover the totality of posts required. While the PHA welcomed the funding allocation, given the remaining ongoing gap in fund ing, it will still be challenging for the HSCQI to deliver on the design intent. There i s therefore a risk that the HSCQI will be unable to fulfil its core function, service corporate requirements or undertake additional requests from the HSC system to support work and training. This risk was further exacerbated due to the redeployment of existing core HSCQI staff on occasions to support the PHA pandemic response. The PHA Chief Executive and Director HSCQI will con tinue to work with the Department and the HSCQI Leadership Alliance to agr ee the priorities for HSCQI (in light of constrained resources) and to discuss fund ing for HSCQI. Staff Resilience during COVID-19 As a result of the necessary response to COVID-19 t he PHA was required to move to 7 day working in April 2020. While organisation s are no longer required to maintain a 7 day working pattern, staff in the PHA have continued to face significant work pressures throughout the year, as they have wo rked to control and reduce the spread of COVID-19. PHA has however limited staff capacity, and while a dditional staff have been brought in during the year, there is concern that in order to maintain the ongoing response a significant proportion of staff have had to work ad ditional hours over a long and sustained period dating back to the beginning of th e Pandemic in March 2020. It is noted that staff are tired, with many also unable t o take all their leave for the second 106 successive year, and therefore there is a risk that staff may become ill and/or no longer be able to continue. A period of recovery f or the Agency's staff, whilst desirable cannot be guaranteed given the ongoing re sponse. The PHA will continue to work with the Director of Human Resources (BSO), the wider HSC and the Department to support staff and s eek ways to build resilience and reset to a business as usual position. The sta nding up of an Organisation Workforce Development group is one example of the s teps taken in year to help support staff. c) Identification of new issues in the current year (including issues identified in the mid-year assurance statement) and antic ipated future issues HRPTS system availability The Business Services Organisation (BSO) has a cont ractual relationship with a supplier providing the managed service for the HR, Payroll, Travel and Subsistence System (HRPTS) for Health and Social Care NI. A su b-contractor of this supplier provides a service incorporating servers hosted at data centres owned by this sub- contractor. The sub-contractor went into administr ation in late March 2022. BSO were advised of the position by the supplier in ear ly April 2022 and have been advised that the sub-contractor will continue to tr ade and operate their business as normal while their Administrators are exploring opt ions for the company's future, including re-negotiating contractual terms with its existing customers. BSO has invoked its business and technical continge ncy plans and set up Bronze Command. BSO has met with the Minister, Permanent Secretary, Trade Unions and all stakeholders has been informed of the situation and the contingency plans to address this issue. 107 12. Conclusion The PHA has a rigorous system of accountability whi ch I can rely on as Accounting Officer to form an opinion on the probity and use o f public funds, as detailed in Managing Public Money NI (MPMNI). Further to considering the accountability framework within the PHA and in conjunction with assurances given to me by the Head of Internal Audit, I am content that the PHA has operated a sound system of interna l governance during the period 2021/22. 108 Remuneration and Staff Report Section 421 of the Companies Act 2006 requires the preparation of a Remuneration Report containing certain information about the Dir ectors' remuneration in accordance with the requirements of Part 4 and Sche dule 8 of Statutory Instrument 2008. Remuneration Policy A committee of Non-Executive Board members exists t o advise the full Board on the remuneration and terms and conditions of service fo r Senior Executives employed by the Public Health Agency (PHA). While the salary structure and the terms and condit ions of service for Senior Executives is determined by the Department of Healt h (DoH), the Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee has a key role in assess ing the performance of Senior Executives and, were permitted by DoH, agreeing the discretionary level of performance related pay. The 2016/17 and 2017/18 Senior Executive's pay awar ds circulars 1/2021 and HSC(SE) 2/2021 were pa id during 2021/22, in line with the Remuneration Committee's agreement on the classification of Executive Directors' performance, categorised against the sta ndards of 'fully acceptable', as on the 2018/19, 2019/20, 2020/21 and 2021/22 Senior Executive pay awards had not been received by 31 March 2022 and r elated payments have not been made to Executive Directors. The salary, pension entitlement and the value of an y taxable benefits in kind paid to both Executive and Non-Executive Directors is set o ut within this report. None of the Executive or Non-Executive Directors of the PHA rec eived any other bonus or performance related pay in 2021/22. It should be no ted that Non-Executive Directors 109 do not receive pensionable remuneration and therefo re there will be no entries in respect of pensions for Non-Executive members. Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the DoH un der the Public Appointments process and the duration of such contracts is norma lly for a term of 4 years. Details of newly appointed Non-Executive Directors or those leaving post have been detailed in the Senior Management Remuneration tabl es below. Executive Directors are employed on a permanent contact unless otherwis e stated in the following remuneration tables. Early Retirement and Other Compensation Schemes There were no early retirements or payments of comp ensation for other departures relating to current or past Senior Executives durin g 2021/22. Membership of the Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee: Mr Andrew Dougal - Chair Professor Nichola Rooney - Non-Executive Director Ms Anne Henderson - Non-Executive Director Alderman Phillip Brett - Non-Executive Director The Committee is supported by the Director of Human Resources (BSO). Non-Executive and Senior Employee's Remuneration an d Pension Entitlement The salary, pension entitlements, and the value of any taxable benefits in kind of the most senior members of the PHA were as follows, it should be noted that there were no bonuses paid to any Director during 2021/22 or 2 020/21. 110 Non-Executive Members (Table Audited) 2021/22 2020/21 Name Salary \u00a3000s Benefits in Kind (to nearest \u00a3100) Pension Benefits (to nearest \u00a31,000) Total \u00a3000s Salary \u00a3000s Benefits in Kind (to nearest \u00a3100) Pension Benefits (to nearest \u00a31,000) Total \u00a3000s Mr Andrew Dougal ( Chair ) 5-10 - John- Clayton 10-15 - - 10-15 5-10 - - 5-10 Mr Joseph 10-15 - - 10-15 5-10 - - 5-10 Councillor Robert Irvine (Joined 12 October 2021) 0-5 - - 0-5 - - - - Alderman Phillip Brett (Joined 12 October 2021) 0-5 - - 0-5 - - - - Mrs Anne Henderson (Joined 12 October 2021) 0-5 - - 0-5 - - - - Alderman Paul Porter (Left 31 July 2021) 0-5 - - 0-5 5-10 - - 5-10 Alderman (Left 31 0-5 - - 0-5 5-10 - - 5-10 Notes: No Non-Executive Members may have received benefits in kind below \u00a350 which would have been rounded down to nil as specified in the 2nd column of the table above.

Pensions of Senior Management (Table Audited) The value of pension benefits accrued during the ye ar is calculated as (the real increase in pension multiplied by 20) plus (the rea l increase in any lump sum) less (the contributions made by the individual). The rea l increases exclude increases due to inflation or any increase or decreases due to tr ansfer of pension rights, but include actuarial uplift factors and therefore can be posit ive or negative . A Cash Equivalent Transfer Value (CETV) is the act uarially assessed capital value of the pension scheme benefits accrued by a member at a particular point in time. The benefits valued are a member's accrued benefits and any contingent spouse's pension payable from the scheme. 2021/22 Name Real increase in pension and related lump sum at age 60 \u00a3000 Total accrued pension at age 60 and related lump sum \u00a3000 CETV at 31/03/21 CETV Mr Aidan Dawson Interim Chief Executive 5-7.5 pension 10-12.5 lump sum 40-45 pension 85-90 lump sum 673 812 121 Dr Aideen Keaney Director of Quality Improvement 2.5-5 pension 0-2.5 lump sum 45-50 pension 95-100 lump sum 841 903 38 Dr Stephen Bergin Interim Director of Public Health 2.5-5 pension 0-2.5 lump sum 65-70 pension 145-150 lump sum 1,227 1,318 55 Mr Stephen Wilson Interim Director of Operations 2-2.5 pension 0-2.5 lump sum 30-35 pension 65-70 lump sum 601 650 32 Mr Rodney Morton Director of Nursing & Allied Health Professionals 0-2.5 pension 0 lump sum 35-40 pension 95-100 lump sum 726 765 22 Mrs Olive MacLeod Interim Chief Executive 0-2.5 pension 2.5-5 lump sum 30-35 pension 100-105 lump sum 784 807 32 113 A CETV is a payment made by a pension scheme, or ar rangement to secure pension benefits in another pension scheme or arran gement when a member leaves the scheme and chooses to transfer their benefits a ccrued in their former scheme. The pension figures shown relate to the benefits th at the individual has accrued as a consequence of their total membership of the pensio n scheme, not just their service in a senior capacity to which disclosure applies. The CETV figures and the other pension details incl ude the value of any pension benefits in another scheme or arrangement which the individual has transferred to the HSC pension scheme. They also include any addit ional pension benefits accrued to the member as a result of their purchasing addit ional years of pension service in the scheme at their own cost. CETVs are calculated within the guidelines and framework prescribed by the Institute and Faculty o f Actuaries. Real increase in CETV - this reflects the increase in CETV effectively funded by the employer. It does not include the increase of accru ed pension due to inflation, contributions paid by the employee (including the v alue of any benefits transferred from another pension scheme or arrangement) and use s common market valuation factors for the start and end of the period. Howeve r, the real increase calculation uses common actuarial factors at the start and end of the period so that it disregards the effect of any changes in factors and focuses on ly on the increase that is funded by the employer. Pension contributions deducted from individual empl oyees are dependent on the level of remuneration receivable and are deducted u sing a scale applicable to the level of remuneration received by the employee. 114 Fair Pay Disclosures (Table(s) Audited) The relationship between the remuneration of the hi ghest-paid director and the lower quartile, median and upper quartile remuneration of the workforce is set out below. Total remuneration includes salary, non-consolidate d performance-related pay, and benefits-in-kind. It does not include severance pay ments, employer pension contributions and the cash equivalent transfer valu e of pensions. 2022 2021 Band of Highest Paid Director's Remuneration (band in \u00a3000s) 190-195 215-220 Percentage Change of Highest Paid Director -12% - Median Total Remuneration (\u00a3) 42,121 40,894 Ratio 4.56 5.28 The change to the ratio is impacted by the decrease in the highest paid director's remuneration.

Und er this multi-employer defined benefit scheme both the PHA and employees p ay specified percentages of pay into the scheme and the liability to pay benefi t falls to the DoH. The PHA is unable to identify its share of the underlying asse ts and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and reliable basis. The Public Service Pensions Act (NI) 2014 provides the legal framework for regular actuarial valuations of the public service pension schemes to measure the costs of the benefits being provided. These valuations infor m the future contribution rates to be paid into the schemes by employers every four ye ars following the scheme valuation. The Act also provides for the establishm ent of an employer cost cap mechanism to ensure that the costs of the pension s chemes remain sustainable in future. 116 The Government Actuary's Department (GAD) is respon sible for carrying out scheme valuations. The Actuary reviews employer con tributions every four years following the scheme valuation. The 2016 scheme val uation was completed by GAD in March 2019. The outcome of this valuation was us ed to set the level of contributions for employers from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2023. An issue identified by the courts in the way that t he 2015 pension reforms were introduced has led to eligible members, with releva nt service between 1 April 2015 and 31 March 2022, being entitled to different pens ion benefits in relation to that period. The different pension benefits relate to t he 1995, 2008 and 2015 HSC Pension Schemes. This is known as the 'McCloud Reme dy' and will impact many aspects of the HSC Pension Schemes including the sc heme valuation outcomes. Further information on this will be included in the HSC Pension Scheme accounts. Average Number of Persons Employed (Table Audited) The average number of whole time equivalent (WTE) p ersons employed during the year was as follows: 2022 2021 Permanently employed staff Others Total Total Commissioning of Health and Social Care 795 89 884 513 Less average staff number in respect of outward secondments (15) - (15) (9) Total net average number of persons employed 780 89 869* 504 *The increase in the 2022 staff numbers is primaril y due to an increase of c381 WTEs relating to Contact Tracing and COVID-19 Vaccinator s. 117 Reporting of Early Retirement and other Compensatio n Schemes - Exit Packages (Table Audited) Exit package cost band Number of compulsory redundancies Number of other departures agreed Total number of exit by cost band 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Total number of exit packages by type - - - - - - Total resource cost \u00a3000s \u00a30 \u00a30 \u00a30 \u00a30 \u00a30 \u00a30 The table above shows the total cost of exit packag es agreed and accounted for in 2021/22 and 2020/21. No exit costs were paid in 202 1/22, the year of departure (2020/21, nil). Staff Benefits The PHA had no staff benefits in 2021/22 or 2020/21 . Retirements due to ill-health During 2021/22, there was 1 person from the PHA agr eed early retirements on the grounds of ill-health. Staff Composition The staff composition broken down by male/female as at 31 March 2022 is illustrated in the table below. Redundancy and other departure costs have been paid in accordance with the provisions of the HSC Pension Scheme Regulations an d the Compensation for Premature Retirement Regulations, statutory provisi ons made under the Superannuation (Northern Ireland) Order 1972. Exit costs are accounted for in full in the year in which the exit package is approved and agreed and are included as operating expenses at Note 3. Where early retiremen ts have been agreed, the additional costs are met by the PHA and not by the HSC pension scheme. Ill-health retirement costs are met by the pension scheme and are not included in the table. 118 Male Female Total Non-Executives 5 3 8 Chief Executive and Directors 4 2 6 Senior Management* 18 49 67 Other 125 394 519 Total 152 448 600 *Senior management is defined as staff in receipt o f a basic whole time equivalent salary of an Agenda for Change Band 8C (greater than c\u00a366k) and staff on Medical and Dental grades Note: Excluded from the staff composition figures above a re Contact Tracers, Seconded staff on payroll of other organisations, Vaccinators, Lay Me mbers, Bank staff and Core Trainees. Sickness Absence Data The corporate cumulative annual absence level for t he PHA for the period from 1 April 2020 - 31 March 2021 is 2.73% (2020/21 2.39%) . There were due to sickness absenc e (2020/21 14,554 hours), or the equivalent of 47 hours (2020/21 42.8 hours) los t per employee. Based on a 7.5 hour working day, this is equal to 6 days per emplo yee (2020/21 5.7 days). Staff Turnover Percentage For a given period, the total turnover figure is ca lculated as the number of leavers within that period divided by the average employee headcount over the period. Voluntary turnover includes leavers classified unde r the categories of resignation, retirement or ill-health retirement. Involuntary tu rnover includes leavers classified under the categories of dismissal, end of fixed ter m contract or ill-health termination. Staff Turnover % 2022 2021 Total Staff Turnover 6.46% 11.82% 6.46% 9.16% 2.66% 119 Staff Engagement Scores HSC organisations do not monitor Employee Engagemen t on an annual basis, but there is a Regional Staff Survey conducted every 3 years. The PHA employee engagement score from the most recent staff survey (2019) was 3.70 out of a possible 5. The response rate was 52%. In addition to the regional survey, the PHA conduct ed a Cultural Assessment survey in February 2020 which measured the culture within the organisation across 8 dimensions. Each of the 8 dimensions was scored out of 5 and the table below shows the scoring against each dimension within PHA . The response rate for this survey was 37.4%. Because of the pandemic, PHA conducted the Cultural Assessment twice to see if, and how, culture was impacted. Reassuringly, the sc ores improved against most dimensions when the survey was completed for the se cond time in November 2020. Dimension Feb 2020 Score Nov 2020 Score Change Values 3.35 3.46 + 0.11 Vision 2.51 2.73 + 0.22 Goals & Performance 3.92 3.61 - 0.31 Quality & Innovation 2.96 3.09 + 0.13 Team Working 3.59 3.68 + 0.09 Compassionate Care 3.95 4.01 + 0.06 Compassionate Leadership 3.40 3.47 + 0.07 Collective Leadership 3.12 3.30 + 0.18 Staff Policies / Employment and Occupation During the year the PHA ensured internal policies g ave full and fair consideration to applications for employment made by disabled person s having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. In this regard the PHA is fully committed to 120 promoting equality of opportunity and good relation s for all groupings under Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The PHA has a range of policies in place that serve to advance this aim, including, on the employment side, the Equality of Opportunity Policy. More information is available on the PHA's website at www.publichealth.hscni.net . Where an employee has become disabled during the co urse of their employment with the PHA, the organisation works closely with H uman Resources (BSO HR Shared Services) who are guided by advice from Occu pational Health. Subsequently, reasonable adjustments can be made to accommodate the employee such as reduced hours, work adjustments including p ossible redeployment, in line with relevant disability legislation. This legislat ion is incorporated into selection and recruitment training and induction training and is highlighted in relevant policies where necessary. The PHA is fully committed to the ongoing training and development of all members of staff and through the performance appraisal syst em all staff are afforded this opportunity irrespective of ability/disability as w ell as having the same opportunities to progress through the organisation. The PHA also participates in the Disability Placeme nt Scheme which provides a six month placement for those with a disability wishing to return to the workplace. During their placement they receive support and guidance - for example, guidance on the completion of application forms when applying for f uture posts. Expenditure on Consultancy The PHA had no expenditure on External Consultancy during 2021/22 (2020/21, nil). 121 Off-Payroll Engagements The PHA is required to disclose whether there were any staff or public sector appointees contracted through employment agencies o r self-employed which cost more than \u00a3245 per day and lasted longer than 6 mon ths during the financial year, which were not paid through the PHA Payroll. The PHA had 18 such 'off-payroll' staff resource en gagements as at 31 March 2022 (2020/21: 0). The following table provides further analysis. Temporary off -payroll worker engagements as at 31 March 2022 Number of existing engagements as of 31 March 2022 18 Of which have: Existed for less than one year at time of reporting 3 Existed for between one and two years at time of re porting 15 These engagements were via a contracted Recruitment Agency and are in compliance with IR35 requirements. No penalty was imposed by HMRC resulting from non-compliance with off-payroll worker legisla tion. 122 Assembly Accountability and Audit Report Funding Report Regularity of Expenditure (Audited) The PHA has robust internal controls in place to su pport the regularity of expenditure. These are supported by procurement exp erts (BSO PaLS), annually reviewed Standing Orders, Standing Financial Instru ctions and Scheme of Delegated Authority and the dissemination of new guidance whe re appropriate. Expenditure and the governing controls are independently review ed by Internal and External Audit, and during 2021/22 there has been no evidenc e of irregular expenditure occurring. Losses and Special Payments (Table Audited) Losses Statement 2021/22 2020/21 Total number of losses 2 0 Total value of losses (\u00a3) \u00a35,880 \u00a30 There were no individual losses over \u00a3250k in the 2 021/22 financial year (2020/21, nil). Special Payments There were no other special payments or gifts made during the year (2020/21, nil). Other Payments and Estimates There were no other payments made during the year ( 2020/21, nil). Remote Contingent Liabilities (Audited) In addition to contingent liabilities reported with in the meaning of IAS37 shown in Note 19 of the financial statements, the PHA also c onsiders liabilities for which the likelihood of a transfer of economic benefit in set tlement is too remote to meet the definition of contingent liability. As at 31 March 2022, the PHA is not aware of any remote contingent liabilities, and there were none in 2020/21. 123 On behalf of the PHA, I approve the Accountability Report encompassing the following sections: Governance Statement. Remuneration and Staff Report. Assembly Accountability and Audit Report. ___________________________ Aidan Dawson Chief Executive Date: 16 th June 2022 124 The Certificate and Report of the Comptroller and A uditor General Opinion on financial statements I certify that I have audited the financial stateme nts of the Public Health Agency for the year ended 31 March 2022 under the Health and S ocial Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009. The financial statements c omprise: the Statements of Comprehensive Net Expenditure, Financial Position, Cash Flows, Changes in Taxpayers' Equity; and the related notes including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been app lied in their preparation is applicable law and UK adopted international account ing standards as interpreted and adapted by the Government Financial Reporting M anual. I have also audited the information in the Accounta bility Report that is described in that report as having been audited. In my opinion the financial statements: give a true and fair view of the state of Public H ealth Agency's affairs as at 31 March 2022 and of the Public Health Agency's net expenditure for the year then ended; and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Health and Social Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009 and Depar tment of Health directions issued thereunder . Opinion on regularity In my opinion, in all material respects the expendi ture and income recorded in the financial statements have been applied to the purpo ses intended by the Assembly and the financial transactions recorded in the fina ncial statements conform to the authorities which govern them. Basis for opinions I conducted my audit in accordance with Internation al Standards on Auditing (ISAs) (UK), applicable law and Practice Note 10 'Audit of Financial Statements and Regularity of Public Sector Bodies in the United Ki ngdom'. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Audito r's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this certificat e. My staff and I are independent of the Public Health Agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to my audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council's Eth ical Standard, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance wi th these requirements. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinions. 125 Conclusions relating to going concern In auditing the financial statements, I have conclu ded that Public Health Agency's use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Based on the work I have performed, I have not iden tified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Public Health Agency's ability to cont inue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the fina ncial statements are authorised for issue. My responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Accounting Officer with respect to going concern are described in the relevant section s of this report. Other Information The other information comprises the information inc luded in the annual report other than the financial statements, the parts of the Acc ountability Report described in that report as having been audited, and my audit certifi cate and report. The Board and the Accounting Officer are responsible for the othe r information included in the annual report. My opinion on the financial stateme nts does not cover the other information and except to the extent otherwise expl icitly stated in my report, I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. My responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent wi th the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appea rs to be materially misstated. If I identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, I am required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard. Opinion on other matters In my opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: the parts of the Accountability Report to be audit ed have been properly prepared in accordance with Department of Health di rections made under the Health and Social Care (Reform) Act (Northern I reland) 2009; and the information given in the Performance Report and Accountability Report for the financial year for which the financial stat ements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements . 126 Matters on which I report by exception In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Public Health Agency and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, I have not identified material misstatements in the Performance Report and Account ability Report. I have nothing to report in respect of the following matters which I report to you if, in my opinion: adequate accounting records have not been kept; or the financial statements and the parts of the Acco untability Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting re cords; or certain disclosures of remuneration specified by t he Government Financial Reporting Manual are not made; or I have not received all of the information and exp lanations I require for my audit; or the Governance Statement does not reflect complian ce with the Department of Finance's guidance. Responsibilities of the Accounting Officer for the financial statements As explained more fully in the Statement of Account ing Officer Responsibilities, the Accounting Officer is responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements in acc ordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and for be ing satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal controls as the Accounting Officer d etermines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free form material misstatement, whether due to fraud of error; and assessing the Public Health Agency's ability to con tinue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Accounting Officer anticipates that the services provided by the Publi c Health Agency will not continue to be provided in the future . Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the fin ancial statements My responsibility is to audit, certify and report o n the financial statements in accordance with the Health and Social Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009. My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance ab out whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material missta tement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue a certificate that includes my o pinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee tha t an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a mate rial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 127 individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expec ted to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of t hese financial statements. I design procedures in line with my responsibilitie s, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of non-compliance with law s and regulation, including fraud. My procedures included: obtaining an understanding of the legal and regula tory framework applicable to the Public Health Agency through disc ussion with management and application of extensive public sect or accountability knowledge. The key laws and regulations I considere d included governing legislation and any other relevant laws and regulat ions identified; making enquires of management and those charged wi th governance on Public Health Agency's compliance with laws and reg ulations; making enquiries of internal audit, management and those charged with governance as to susceptibility to irregularity and fraud, their assessment of the risk of material misstatement due to fraud a nd irregularity, and their knowledge of actual, suspected and alleged fraud an d irregularity; completing risk assessment procedures to assess th e susceptibility of Public Health Agency's financial statements to mate rial misstatement, including how fraud might occur. This included, but was not limited to, an engagement director led engagement team discussion on fraud to identify particular areas, transaction streams and business practices that may be susceptible to material misstatement due to fraud. As part of this discussion, I identified potential for fraud in the following areas: revenue recognition, expenditure recognition and posting of unusual journals; engagement director oversight to ensure the engage ment team collectively had the appropriate competence, capabi lities and skills to identify or recognise non-compliance with the appli cable legal and regulatory framework throughout the audit; documenting and evaluating the design and implemen tation of internal controls in place to mitigate risk of material miss tatement due to fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations; designing audit procedures to address specific law s and regulations which the engagement team considered to have a direct mat erial effect on the financial statements in terms of misstatement and i rregularity, including fraud. These audit procedures included, but were no t limited to, reading board and committee minutes, and agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation and approvals as appropriate; addressing the risk of fraud as a result of manage ment override of controls by: 128 o performing analytical procedures to identify unusu al or unexpected relationships or movements; o testing journal entries to identify potential anom alies, and inappropriate or unauthorised adjustments; o assessing whether judgements and other assumptions made in determining accounting estimates were indicative of potential bias; o investigating significant or unusual transactions made outside of the normal course of business; and A further description of my responsibilities for th e audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's websit e www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities . This description forms part of my certificate. In addition, I am required to obtain evidence suffi cient to give reasonable assurance that the expenditure and income recorded in the fin ancial statements have been applied to the purposes intended by the Assembly an d the financial transactions recorded in the financial statements conform to the authorities which govern them. Report I have no observations to make on these financial s tatements .

The accounting policies contained in the FReM apply International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adapted or interprete d for the public sector context. Where the FReM permits a choice of accounting polic y, the accounting policy which is judged to be most appropriate to the particular circumstances of the Public Health Agency (PHA) for the purpose of giving a true and f air view has been selected. The particular policies adopted by the PHA are describe d below. They have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered mater ial in relation to the accounts, unless otherwise stated. In addition, due to the manner in which the PHA is funded, the Statement of Financial Position will show a negative position. I n line with the FReM, sponsored entities such as the PHA which show total net liabi lities, should prepare financial statements on a going concern basis. The cash requi red to discharge these net liabilities will be requested from the Department w hen they fall due, and is shown in the Statement of Changes in Taxpayers' Equity. 1.1 Accounting convention These accounts have been prepared under the histori cal cost convention modified to account for the revaluation of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and inventories. 1.2 Currency and Rounding These accounts are presented in UK Pounds (\u00a3) sterl ing. The figures in the accounts are shown to the nearest \u00a31,000, which may give ris e to rounding differences. 1.3 Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment assets comprise Build ings, Plant & Machinery, Information Technology, and Furniture & Fittings. Recognition Property, plant and equipment must be capitalised i f: it is held for use in delivering services or for a dministrative purposes; it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential will be supplied to, the PHA; it is expected to be used for more than one financ ial year; the cost of the item can be measured reliably; and Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 136 the item has cost of at least \u00a35,000; or collectively, a number of items have a cost of at least \u00a35,000 where the assets are functionally interdependent, they had broadly s imultaneous purchase dates, are anticipated to have simultaneous disposal dates and are under single managerial control; or items form part of the initial equipping and setti ng-up cost of a new building or unit, irrespective of their individual or collectiv e cost. On initial recognition property, plant and equipmen t are measured at cost including any expenditure such as installation, directly attr ibutable to bringing them into working condition. Items classified as \"under const ruction\" are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position to the extent that money has been paid or a liability has been incurred. Valuation of Land and Buildings The PHA does not hold any land, and the buildings o ccupied by the PHA are held under lease arrangements. Assets under Construction (AUC) Assets in the course of construction for service or administration purposes are carried at cost, less any impairment loss. Assets a re revalued and depreciation commences when they are brought into use. The PHA h ad no AUC in either 2021/22 or 2020/21. Short Life Assets Short life assets are not indexed. Short life is de fined as a useful life of up to and including 5 years. Short life assets are carried at depreciated historic cost as this is not considered to be materially different from fair value and are depreciated over their useful life. Where estimated life of fixtures and equipment exce ed 5 years, suitable indices will be applied each year and depreciation will be based on indexed amount. Revaluation Reserve An increase arising on revaluation is taken to the revaluation reserve except when it reverses an impairment for the same asset previousl y recognised in expenditure, in which case it is credited to expenditure to the ext ent of the decrease previously charged there. A revaluation decrease is recognised as an impairment charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a balance on the reserve for the asset and, thereafter, to expenditure. 1.4 Depreciation No depreciation is provided on freehold land since land has unlimited or a very long established useful life. Items under construction a re not depreciated until they are commissioned. Properties that are surplus to requir ements and which meet the definition of \"non-current assets held for sale\" ar e also not depreciated. Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 137 Otherwise, depreciation is charged to write off the costs or valuation of property, plant and equipment and similarly, amortisation is applied to intangible non-current assets, less any residual value, over their estimat ed useful lives, in a manner that reflects the consumption of economic benefits or se rvice potential of the assets. Assets held under finance leases are also depreciat ed over the lower of their estimated useful lives and the terms of the lease. The estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which the PHA expects to o btain economic benefits or service potential from the asset. Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed each year end, with the effect of any chan ges recognised on a prospective basis. The following asset lives have been used. Asset Type Asset Life Freehold Buildings 25 - 60 years IT assets 3 - 10 years Intangible assets 3 - 10 years Other Equipment 3 - 15 years 1.5 Impairment loss If there has been an impairment loss due to a gener al change in prices, the asset is written down to its recoverable amount, with the lo ss charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a balance on th e reserve for the asset and, thereafter, to expenditure within the Statement of Comprehensive Net Expenditure (SoCNE). If the impairment is due to the consumptio n of economic benefits the full amount of the impairment is charged to the SoCNE an d an amount up to the value of the impairment in the revaluation reserve is transf erred to the SoCNE Reserve. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of the recover able amount but capped at the amount that would have been determined had there be en no initial impairment loss. The reversal of the impairment loss is credited fir stly to the SoCNE to the extent of the decrease previously charged there and thereafte r to the revaluation reserve. 1.6 Subsequent expenditure Where subsequent expenditure enhances an asset beyo nd its original specification, the directly attributable cost is capitalised. Wher e subsequent expenditure which meets the definition of capital restores the asset to its original specification, the expenditure is capitalised and any existing carryin g value of the item replaced is written-out and charged to operating expenses. The overall useful life of the PHA's buildings take s account of the fact that different components of those buildings have different useful lives. This ensures that depreciation is charged on those assets at the same rate as if separate components had been identified and depreciated at different ra tes. 1.7 Intangible assets Intangible assets includes any of the following hel d - software, licences, trademarks, websites, development expenditure, Patents, Goodwil l and intangible Assets under Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 138 Construction. Software that is integral to the oper ating of hardware, for example an operating system is capitalised as part of the rele vant item of property, plant and equipment. Software that is not integral to the ope ration of hardware, for example application software, is capitalised as an intangib le asset. Expenditure on research is not capitalised: it is recognised as an operating e xpense in the period in which it is incurred. Internally-generated assets are recognise d if, and only if, all of the following have been demonstrated: the technical feasibility of completing the intang ible asset so that it will be available for use; the intention to complete the intangible asset and use it; the ability to sell or use the intangible asset; how the intangible asset will generate probable fu ture economic benefits or service potential; the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the intangible asset and sell or use it; and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure at tributable to the intangible asset during its development. Recognition Intangible assets are non-monetary assets without p hysical substance, which are capable of sale separately from the rest of the PHA 's business or which arise from contractual or other legal rights. Intangible asset s are considered to have a finite life. They are recognised only when it is probable that f uture economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the PHA wh ere the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. All single items over \u00a35,000 in value must be capitalised while intangible assets which fall within the grouped ass et definition may be capitalised if the group is at least \u00a35,000 in value. The amount r ecognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure inc urred from the date of commencement of the intangible asset, until it is c omplete and ready for use. Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognised at fair value. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at fair value by reference to an active market, and as no active market currently exists de preciated replacement cost has been used as fair value. 1.8 Non-current assets held for sale The PHA had no non-current assets held for sale in either 2021/22 or 2020/21. 1.9 Inventories The PHA had no inventories as at 31 March 2022 or 3 1 March 2021. 1.10 Income Income is classified between Revenue from Contracts and Other Operating Income as assessed necessary in line with organisational a ctivity, under the requirements of IFRS 15 and as applicable to the public sector. Jud gement is exercised in order to Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 139 determine whether the five essential criteria withi n the scope of IFRS 15 are met in order to define income as a contract. Income relates directly to the activities of the PH A and is recognised when, and to the extent that a performance obligation is satisfi ed in a manner that depicts the transfer to the customer of the goods or services p romised. Where the criteria to determine whether a contract is in existence are not met, income is classified as Other Operating Income with in the Statement of Comprehensive Net Expenditure (SoCNE) and is recogn ised when the right to receive payment is established. Income is stated net of VAT. Grant in aid Funding received from other entities, including the DoH is accounted for as grant in aid and is reflected through the Statement of Compr ehensive Net Expenditure Reserve. 1.11 Investments The PHA did not hold any investments in either 2021 /22 or 2020/21. 1.12 Research and Development expenditure Research and development expenditure is expensed in the year it is incurred in accordance with IAS 38. Following the introduction of the 2010 European Sys tem of Accounts (ESA10) from 2016/17, there has been a change in the budgeting t reatment (a change from the revenue budget to the capital budget) of research a nd development (R&D) expenditure. As a result, additional disclosures ar e included, where necessary, in the notes to the accounts. 1.13 Other expenses Other operating expenses for goods or services are recognised when, and to the extent that, they have been received. They are meas ured at the fair value of the consideration payable. 1.14 Cash and cash equivalents Cash is cash in hand and deposits with any financia l institution repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash e quivalents are investments that mature in 3 months or less from the date of acquisi tion and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignifi cant risk of change in value. 1.15 Leases Leases are classified as finance leases when substa ntially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. All oth er leases are classified as operating leases. Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 140 The PHA as lessee The PHA held no finance leases during 2021/22 or 20 20/21. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expen se on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are recognise d initially as a liability and subsequently as a reduction of rentals on a straigh t-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Where a lease is for land and buildings, the land a nd buildings components are separated. Leased land may be either an operating l ease or a finance lease depending on the conditions in the lease agreement and following the general principle set out in IAS 17. Leased buildings are a ssessed as to whether they are operating or finance leases. The PHA as lessor The PHA did not have any lessor agreements in eithe r 2021/22 or 2020/21. 1.16 Private Finance Initiative (PFI) transactions The PHA had no PFI transactions during 2021/22 or 2 020/21. 1.17 Financial instruments A financial instrument is defined as any contract t hat gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity inst rument of another entity. The PHA has financial instruments in the form of tr ade receivables and payables and cash and cash equivalents. Financial assets Financial assets are recognised on the Statement of Financial Position when the DoH body becomes party to the financial instrument contract or, in the case of trade receivables, when the goods or services have been d elivered. Financial assets are de-recognised when the contractual rights have expi red or the asset has been transferred. Financial assets are initially recognised at fair v alue. IFRS 9 requires consideration of the expected credit loss model on financial asse ts. The measurement of the loss allowance depends upon the PHA's assessment at the end of each reporting period as to whether the financial instrument's credit ris k has increased significantly since initial recognition, based on reasonable and suppor table information that is available, without undue cost or effort to obtain. The amount of expected credit loss recognised is measured on the basis of the probability weighte d present value of anticipated cash shortfalls over the life of the instrument, wh ere judged necessary. Financial assets are classified into the following categories: o financial assets at fair value through Statement o f Comprehensive Net Expenditure; Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 141 o held to maturity investments; o available for sale financial assets; and o loans and receivables. The classification depends on the nature and purpos e of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are recognised on the Stateme nt of Financial Position when the DoH body becomes party to the contractual provision s of the financial instrument or, in the case of trade payables, when the goods or se rvices have been received. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the li ability has been discharged, that is, the liability has been paid or has expired. Financial liabilities are initially recognised at f air value. Financial risk management IFRS 7 requires disclosure of the role that financi al instruments have had during the period in creating or changing the risks a body fac es in undertaking its activities. Because of the relationships with the DoH, and the manner in which they are funded, financial instruments play a more limited role with in HSC bodies in creating risk than would apply to a non-public sector body of a simila r size, therefore the PHA is not exposed to the degree of financial risk faced by bu siness entities. The PHA has limited powers to borrow or invest surp lus funds and financial assets and liabilities are generated by day to day operati onal activities rather than being held to change the risks facing the PHA in undertak ing activities. Therefore the PHA is exposed to little credit, liquidity or market ri sk. Currency risk The PHA is principally a domestic organisation with the great majority of transactions, assets and liabilities being in the U K and Sterling based. The PHA has no overseas operations. The PHA therefore has low e xposure to currency rate fluctuations. Interest rate risk The PHA has limited powers to borrow or invest and therefore has low exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Credit and liquidity risk Since the PHA receives the majority of its funding from the DoH, it has low exposure to credit risk and is not exposed to significant li quidity risks. 1.18 Provisions In accordance with IAS 37, provisions are recognise d when the PHA has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a p ast event, it is probable that the PHA will be required to settle the obligation, and a re liable estimate can be made of the Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 142 amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligatio n at the end of the reporting year, taking into account the risks and uncertainties. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation, its carrying amount is the present valu e of those cash flows as at 31 March 2022, using the discount rates issued by the Department of Finance (DoF) below. Rate Time period Real rate Nominal Short term (0 - 5 years) 0.47% Medium term (5 - 10 years) 0.70% Long term (10 - 40 years) 0.95% Very long term (40+ years) 0.66% Inflationary Year 1 4.0% Year 2 2.6% Into perpetuity 2.0% Note that Public Expenditure System issued a combin ed nominal and inflation rate table to incorporate the two elements - please refe r to this table as necessary, as included within circular HSC(F) 39-2021. The discount rate to be applied for employee early departure obligations is (1.30%) for 2021/22. The PHA has also disclosed the carrying amount at t he beginning and end of the year, additional provisions made, amounts used duri ng the year, unused amounts reversed during the year and increases in the disco unted amount arising from the passage of time and the effect of any change in the discount rate. When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the re ceivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursements will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as a provision. An onerous contract is considered t o exist where the PHA has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeti ng the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to b e received under it. A restructuring provision is recognised when the PH A develops a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid e xpectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to imp lement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 143 The measurement of a restructuring provision includ es only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amo unts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated wi th on-going activities of the PHA. 1.19 Contingent liabilities/assets In addition to contingent liabilities disclosed in accordance with IAS 37, the PHA discloses for Assembly reporting and accountability purposes certain statutory and non-statutory contingent liabilities where the like lihood of a transfer of economic benefit is remote, but which have been reported to the Assembly in accordance with the requirements of Managing Public Money Northern Ireland. Where the time value of money is material, continge nt liabilities which are required to be disclosed under IAS 37 are stated at discounted amounts and the amount reported to the Assembly separately noted. Continge nt liabilities that are not required to be disclosed by IAS 37 are stated at the amounts reported to the Assembly. Under IAS 37, the PHA discloses contingent liabilit ies where there is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose e xistence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the PHA, or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that a payment will be r equired to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured suf ficiently reliably. A contingent liability is disclosed unless the possibility of a payment is remote. A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or no n-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the contr ol of the PHA. A contingent asset is disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is p robable. 1.20 Employee benefits Short-term employee benefits Under the requirements of IAS 19: Employee Benefits , staff costs must be recorded as an expense as soon as the organisation is obliga ted to pay them. This includes the cost of any untaken leave that has been earned at the year end. This cost has been calculated based on the balance remaining in t he computerised leave system for all staff as at 31 March 2022. Untaken flexi le ave is estimated to be immaterial to the PHA and has not been included. Retirement benefit costs Past and present employees are covered by the provi sions of the HSC Pension Scheme. Under this multi-employer defined benefit s cheme both the PHA and employees pay specified percentages of pay into the scheme and the liability to pay benefit falls to the DoH. The PHA is unable to iden tify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consisten t and reliable basis. Further information regarding the HSC Pension Scheme can be found in the HSC Pension Scheme Statement in the Departmental Resource Accou nt for the Department of Health. Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 144 The costs of early retirements, except those for il l-health retirements, are met by the PHA and charged to the Statement of Comprehensive N et Expenditure at the time the PHA commits itself to the retirement. As per the requirements of IAS 19, full actuarial v aluations by a professionally qualified actuary are required with sufficient regu larity that the amounts recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially f rom those determined at the reporting period date. FReM provides an interpreta tion of the IAS 19 standard and this standard requires the present value of defined benefit obligations to be determined with sufficient regularity that the amou nts recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially from those dete rmined at the reporting period date. The 2021-22 accounts are based on membership data a s at 31 March 2016 since it was not practicable to utilise data as 31 March 202 0 within the time parameters available. The value of the liabilities as at 31 Ma rch 2022 has been calculated by rolling forward the liability calculated as at 31 M arch 2016 to 31 March 2022. The 2016 valuation assumptions are retained for demogra phics whilst financial assumptions are updated to reflect current financia l conditions and a change in financial assumption methodology. The 2016 valuatio n is the most recently completed valuation, since the 2020 valuation is on going which is why the demographics assumptions are not updated. 1.21 Reserves Statement of Comprehensive Net Expenditure Reserve Accumulated surpluses are accounted for in the Stat ement of Comprehensive Net Expenditure Reserve. Revaluation Reserve The Revaluation Reserve reflects the unrealised bal ance of cumulative indexation and revaluation adjustments to assets. 1.22 Value Added Tax (VAT) Where output VAT is charged or input VAT is recover able, the amounts are stated net of VAT. Irrecoverable VAT is charged to the rel evant expenditure category or included in the capitalised purchase cost of fixed assets. 1.23 Third party assets The PHA had no third party assets in 2021/22 or 202 0/21. 1.24 Government Grants The PHA had no government grants in 2021/22 or 2020 /21. 1.25 Losses and Special Payments Losses and special payments are items that the Asse mbly would not have contemplated when it agreed funds for the health se rvice or passed legislation. By their nature they are items that ideally should not arise. They are therefore subject to Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 145 special control procedures compared with the genera lity of payments. They are divided into different categories, which govern the way that individual cases are handled. Losses and special payments are charged to the rele vant functional headings in expenditure on an accruals basis, including losses which would have been made good through insurance cover had the PHA not been b earing its own risks (with insurance premiums then being included as normal re venue expenditure). However, the note on losses and special payments is compiled directly from the losses register which reports amounts on an accruals basis with the exception of provisions for future losses. 1.26 Accounting standards that have been issued but have not yet been adopted Under IAS 8 there is a requirement to disclose thos e standards issued but not yet adopted. The International Accounting Standards Board have i ssued the following new standards but which are either not yet effective or adopted. Under IAS 8 there is a requirement to disclose these standards together wi th an assessment of their initial impact on application. IFRS10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 J oint Arrangements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in Other Entities: The IASB have issued new and amended standards (IFR S 10, IFRS 11 & IFRS 12) that affect the consolidation and reporting of subs idiaries, associates and joint ventures. These standards were effective with EU ad option from 1 January 2014. Accounting boundary IFRS' are currently adapted in the FReM so that the Westminster departmental accounting boundary is bas ed on Office of National Statistics (ONS) control criteria, as designated by Treasury. A similar review in NI, which will bring NI departm ents under the same adaptation, has been carried out and the resulting recommendati ons were agreed by the Executive in December 2016. With effect from 2022-2 3, the accounting boundary for departments will change and there will also be an i mpact on departments around the disclosure requirements under IFRS 12. ALBs apply I FRS in full and their consolidation boundary may change as a result of th e new Standards. IFRS 16 Leases: IFRS 16 is effective from 1 April 2022 and has the effect of largely eliminating the current 'off-balance sheet' treatment of operating leases under IAS 17. A lessee is now required to recognise a \"right-of-use\" asset (t he right to use the leased item) and a financial liability for any operating leases wher e the term is greater than 12 months, excluding those where the associated right-of-use a sset is of low value. The PHA has set the low value financial threshold a t \u00a35k and from the lease agreement can determine the non-cancellable periods for which the PHA has the Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 146 right to use the underlying asset. One key consider ation is calculating the implicit interest rate within the lease agreement. Based on the PHA's review to date of operating leas es associated with buildings, equipment and other assets there is likely to be mi nimal financial impact on the 2022/23 financial statements. The PHA hold 3 Leases which will transfer onto the Statement of Financial Position (SoFP) in accordance with IFRS 16 on 1 April 2022. 2 leases with a combined Net Book Value (NBV) of \u00a33 6k will come onto the SoFP and will cease on 17 June 2022. 1 lease with a NBV of \u00a3499k will come onto the SoFP and cease on 30 September 2026. 1 lease with a NBV of \u00a33k will not go onto the SoFP as it is categorised for a recognition exemption for leases of low-value. IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts: IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts will replace IFRS 4 Ins urance Contracts and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or af ter 1 January 2023. In line with the requirements of the FReM, IFRS 17 will be implement ed, as interpreted and adapted for the public sector, with effect from 1 April 202 3. Management currently assess that there will be mini mal impact on application to the PHA's financial statements. 1.27 Changes in accounting policies/Prior year rest atement There were no changes in accounting policies during the year ended 31 March 2022. 2022 2021 Summary Administration 2.3 36,855 29,592 Safeguarding Board NI 2.4 743 729 Total Commissioner Resources utilised 147,702 131,252 2.1 Commissioning 2022 2021 Expenditure NOTE Health & Social Care Trust SoCNE 20,977 19,706 South Eastern Health & Social Care Trust SoCNE 6,118 5 ,386 Southern Health & Social Care Trust SoCNE 8,967 7,929 Northern Health & Social Care Trust SoCNE 10,174 9,445 Western Health & Social Care Trust SoCNE 8,740 7,981 NIAS Health & Social Care Trust SoCNE 117 87 NI Medical & Dental Training Agency SoCNE 169 167 PCC SoCNE 0 35 Other 3.1 55,177 50,682 110,439 101,418 Income Revenue from contracts with customers 3,471 Commissioning Net Expenditure 107,549 97,948 2.2 FHS 3.1 Administration 2022 2021 Expenditure NOTE \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Salaries and 27,050 Operating expenditure 3.2 2,887 2,808 Non-cash costs 3.3 24 22 Depreciation 3.3 399 201 37,742 30,081 Other Operating Income Staff secondment recoveries 4.2 887 489 Administration Net Expenditure 36,855 29,592 2.4 Safeguarding Board NI Expenditure Salaries and wages 3.2 522 407 Operating expenditure 3.2 221 322 Programme expenditure 3.1 0 0 743 729 Safeguarding Board NI Net Expenditure 743 729 Public Health Agency The PHA has identified 4 segments: Commissioning, Family He alth Services (FHS), Administration, and Safeguarding Board NI - an independent body hosted by the PHA.

The PHA did not hold any inventories as at 31 March 2022 or 31 March 2021. Public Health Agency As the cash requirements of PHA are met through Grant-in-Aid provided by the Department of Health, financial instruments play a more limited role in creating a nd managing risk than would apply to a non-public sector body. The majority of financial instruments relate t o contracts to buy non-financial items in line with the PHA's expected purchase and usage requirements and the P HA is therefore exposed to little credit, liquidity or market risk. The PHA had no impairments in 2021/22 or 2020/21. Non current assets held for sale comprise non current assets that are held for resale rather than for continuing use within the business.
