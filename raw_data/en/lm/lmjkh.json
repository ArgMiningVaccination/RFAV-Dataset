Abstract: An important component of homeopathic therapy involves the homeopath-patient rapport that seeks not only to obtain a complete history for finding an accurate homeopathic remedy, but also involves developing an appropriate relationship of trust to elicit personal details. Homeopathic literature is largely silent on the skills required of the homeopath to develop a relationship with a patient that is therapeutic in itself. The psychological and spiritual awareness of the homeopath plays an important role in a therapeutic relationship, apart from his/her clinical expertise. The person centered approach developed by Carl Rogers, with its phenomenological epistemology, has parallels with the homeopathic therapeutic relationship. It has a knowledge and experience base that can help create homeopathic literature, which in turn can inform a deeper exploration into the homeopathic therapeutic relationship. The encounters of experienced homeopaths in the therapeutic relationship are based on their individual spiritual, religious, cultural, or educational backgrounds and could add to the richness and depth of this knowledge base. This is an exploration of personal experience in therapeutic relationships inspired by my Christian, Indian background, seeking to analyse how my spirituality supports and informs the theory of therapeutic relationship from various perspectives. Given the similarity of the fundamental Christian experience, it is possible that other homeopaths of a Christian (or similar) religious background would benefit from the theoretical models I describe, in their own therapeutic relationships. This paper is a reflective study of my personality limitations and strengths, with reference to the theory of supervision. It is an attempt to distinguish my personal style as a supervisor to enhance both professional and supervisory growth and development. In addition, I suggest two exploratory models of homeopathic supervision for advanced specialization based on supervision theory and models available in literature. These are suitable to the homeopathic professional development as it exists in India. These two models take into account the unique Indian cultural ethos, as well as dominant method of instruction prevalent. Pastoral psychologists have long tried to establish a working model that encompasses the seemingly conflicting disciplines of science and religion. Psychosynthesis, a transpersonal psychology and therapeutic approach, offers such a model of the human personality, in which the psychological and spiritual perspectives can converge. This article explores psychosynthesis psychology and therapy as a theoretical framework for pastoral psychology. Although psychosynthesis psychotherapy relies on an array of techniques, it fundamentally works with the clients' will while emphasizing, exploring, and cultivating their relationships on all levels\u2014intrapersonal, interpersonal, and with the Higher Self. In addition to the subconscious, psychosynthesis includes a higher psychological plane, called the superconscious, from which our higher ethical, aesthetic, scientific, and spiritual values are derived. This article begins by introducing psychosynthesis concepts and techniques. It then provides qualitative findings showing that psychosynthesis counseling helped to awaken spirituality in three out of eleven clients who had formerly identified themselves as atheists. In addition, testimonies are included that show that psychosynthesis counseling also helped all eleven clients to attain personal growth. Finally, the counselor describes her experience of psychosynthesis as a Christian in the therapeutic setting. The framework of psychosynthesis psychology and its techniques are viable methodologies for anyone searching to incorporate spiritual growth into a psychological working model. Forty-one years have passed since Haronian (1976) offered the readers of this journal his personal overview as a psychotherapist of the rich capacity of psychosynthesis to bridge the chasm between psychology and religion\u2014yet his call remains unheeded. Perhaps more than ever before, pastoral psychologists are struggling to fit religious, spiritual, and transcendent If Mesmer succeeded where a Christian exorcist failed, surely we need have the courage to assert that such an example need not lead us to expect modern psychology was without Jesus influence. This is my preferred draft of the first of twelve essays for required assessment in the advanced diploma of transpersonal Art therapy, a two year undergraduate course offered in Australia at a private learning institution, which encourages us to think of Art Therapy within all of what Psychotherapy is, as a modern approximation of Shaman's skill. Naturally the teachers are quick to point out that we are missing a lot of what Shaman learn. As a Christian I have had sound cause to doubt the benefit of the transpersonal branch of modern psychology; and yet, I know in my own example of the efficacy of, and I also believe that transpersonal theory may yet prove relevant in enabling much of modern psychology theory to gradually accept how embedded in Christian teaching it already is. I am myself already a recognized Shaman, but recognized only within traditional indigenous contexts here in Australia, within which society the regulation patterns of health care givers, are not already recognized by westerners. In the traditional indigenous context, Christianity is totally integrated within what psychologists might call a transpersonal world view. Whether psychologists as a profession, and particularly the psychologists who practice transpersonal psychology can integrate themselves into this world view, is another matter. 1992 A history of the origins, principles, and evolution of Transpersonal Psychology. Subtle energy is at the core of many modern alternative (holistic) healing therapies. Acupuncture, Therapeutic Touch (TT) and homeopathy are three popular modalities based in subtle energy ideology. Holistic theoreticians have combined the theory of vitalism\u2014both eastern and western\u2014with quantum speculation in forming modern energy ideology. This article's premise\u2014that subtle energy is really the action of personal, demonic spirits\u2014is explored with reference to mechanistic-scientific, holistic, and biblical-theological paradigms. On the one hand, energy healing fails the tests of the scientific-mechanistic paradigm. Conversely, leading holistic theorists acknowledge subtle energy as psi; and also clearly note the role of spirits in it. Biblical theology traces such \"nature\" forces to the Old Testament doctrine of chaoskampf (conflict-with-chaos)\u2014God's creational conflict with Satan. The New Testament disavows any use by Jesus of subtle energy, and warns against false demonic signs and wonders. International Journal of Integrative Psychotherapy 2018 Previous scholarly studies have discussed the use of Zen Buddhism within the person-centred approach of Carl Rogers, demonstrating the feasible influence of Buddhism over Rogers's theories. The present research delves into the convergence and divergence of person-centred therapy and the Mahyna (one of the current mainstreams of Buddhism) philosophy explicated within the Vimalakrti Nirdea Stra (a significant Mahyna canon); particular, the bodhisattva spirit and four immeasurables, including loving-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity. Findings indicate that Carl Rogers's counselling principles and practices comply with the Buddhist teachings of phenomenal vision, actualising tendency, and innate eagerness to alleviate suffering. This discussion also analyses ideas that have seldom been examined in person-centred principles, such as bodhisattva altruism, mind purity in nature and impurity caused by bewilderment, compassion fatigue, causes of suffering, and counselling techniques. Mahyna wisdom potentially offers references to the Rogerian family of theories, which also sheds light on the use of Buddhist-influenced non-medical interventions. Proceedings of the 7th National SCAPE Conference 28th -30th April 2006 Edited by Kaalii Cargill 2006 It is also possible to take the methodology of analyzing the Biblical narrative to another level. In this paper I want to explore the whole narrative of the gospels in the interaction of all the various characters and events that enter the story as the symbol or archetype of the Self and ego, and their processes with various complexes, as understood in Jungian terms, or sub-personalities, as understood in Psychosynthesis. It will require the development of a methodology for creating composite pictures out of the four accounts in the Bible, and will draw on apocryphal texts to elucidate certain relationships. In this way I hope to show that the whole narrative is an amazing wealth of knowledge about the psychic processes within an individual. The relationships between Christ, as the Self and ego, and the other personalities, can reveal the nature of a complex or sub-personality, and how the relationship to the Self can bring the archetype into play within the soul. Thus a constructive co-working relationship between the ego and the Self can create health within a person's journey. Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.
