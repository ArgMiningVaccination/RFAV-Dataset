We service suburbs across Brisbane, see our travel zones to check if our mobile service covers your area. VETMACS does not provide after hours or emergency services. If your pet requires emergency care please take them to your nearest veterinary clinic or one of the emergency centres listed below. Once we found Dr Amanda as our vet, we haven't let her go. She has been our family vet for nearing on 10 years. Our pet family has always included German Shepherds plus one fluffy Alaskan Malamute and we have given her some tricky situations to help us resolve. If you want a vet who provides solutions and options AND thinks outside normal veterinary skills, you would be hard pressed to find someone more dedicated. Dr Amanda has a great rapport with our dogs who look forward to seeing her whenever she visits. We receive nothing less than professional courteous care for our two Shepherds every single time - with a wicked sense of humour to boot. We cannot recommend Dr Amanda highly enough. It is difficult to find a trustworthy veterinary professional in a sea of expensive franchise vet practices. Dr Amanda offers a truly holistic approach to animal health where other practitioners will rarely explore anything beyond traditional treatments. We have dogs that usually shy away from being handled by strangers and have been difficult in the past to be examined. Dr Amanda's calming personality always has our dogs relaxed and receptive to examination and physio/chiro manipulation. Thank you Dr Amanda for taking the time and care to understand our dogs and to explain in plain language what is going on with them. It is comforting to know that if we have a question or concern you are only a phone call away. I have no hesitation in recommending Amanda. She is very professional, caring and knowledgeable vet. Amanda has been taking care of my maltese Shitzu Coco regularly. Coco has become a lot more relaxed and no longer seems to be in pain after regular chiropractic and last appointment acupuncture. Having Amanda visit our home also made the experience a lot less complicated. Coco and I are very impressed with Amanda's service. Amanda has been treating my elderly dog with acupuncture to alleviate his pain and stiffness and also anxiety. She is unfailingly kind and gentle and he continues to be to happy to see her each time which is great as he usually is very stressed by visits to the Vet. The treatment has made a noticeable improvement to his mobility and comfort. Vetmacs has been treating Balkey, my near 13 year old labrador, since July 2019 after he was diagnosed with disc disease and began to lose function in his hind legs. Balkey is treated regularly with acupuncture and various complimentary & conventional medicines. Amanda has significantly improved Balkey's quality of life and we are very thankful that her mobile business gives pet owners like myself, who are unable to get their fur babies in the car, access to such a professional veterinary service. I cant recommend Amanda highly enough - especially for those who are open to complimentary therapies such as acupuncture, cold laser therapy and a holistic approach to their pet's care. Acupuncture can be used to treat a variety of conditions including arthritis and anxiety. It may be used alone or in combination with other therapies. Chiropractic care involves the evaluation of the biomechanics system to see how the muscles and bones are working together. Appropriate adjustments can help maintain optimal physical function. Canine athletes undergo the same stressors that human athletes do and often suffer from soft injuries. Rehabilitation is important to get animals back into peak physical condition following an injury or surgery. VETMACS can provide regular veterinary services including vaccinations and care of your pet when they are injured or ill, all in the comfort of your own home. Vaccinations protect your pet from preventable diseases. At VETMACS we use triennial vaccinations for dogs and encourage titre testing for both dogs and cats as part of the vaccination program. Titre testing provides a measure of your pets immunity following vaccination. It can be used to determine whether your pet requires a booster or has sufficient current immunity. Our business is all about taking a holistic approach, tailoring treatments to our patients. People aren't always aware that there are other options other than medication. We take into account what the main problems or concerns are with your pet and provide treatment that is appropriate for that condition. It may be either standard medicine, complementary therapies such as acupuncture or chiropractic care, or a combination of both. Some pets have conditions which limit medications that can be given so owners often despair that their pets are still in pain but their regular vet can't offer any other solutions. We love being able to help these animals. Our focus is on treating the pet and improving their quality of life rather than simply focusing on a condition.
