A young, multidisciplinary group in the Medical Section has been preparing this conference since the summer of 2017. We want to build bridges between body, soul and spirit, between natural science and spiritual science, between generations, countries and professions for an integrative art of healing with the human being at its center. In over 30 impulse talks and more than 120 specialist courses we will bring to life the anthroposophic view of the human being based on the four elements, the ethers and levels of consciousness, making it practical for medicine. How do body and soul penetrate each other in moments of enthusiasm? How does everyday professional life change when we work together for the ideals of freedom, love and wisdom? What is a healthy medical facility and what is a salutary healthcare system? What understanding of disease, what therapeutic concepts can Anthroposophic Medicine, as an integrative form of medicine, contribute to the various specialist areas? How does cooperation between the different healing professions advance through this approach? Celebrating 100 Years of Anthroposophic Medicine also invites us to make this a festive occasion! Be it with speeches, artistic performances, dance and encounters with people from over 50 countries. Or in the form of science spaces, panel discussions and future forums, where we want to reflect and ask questions: to what extent can we visualize the original impulses in the medicine founded by Rudolf Steiner and Ita Wegman today? What were the scientific, health policy and therapeutic milestones of the last 100 years? What are the prospects for the next 100 years? And what tasks and challenges are ahead of us to meet the needs of the patients and the people we care for? Finally, we would like to turn our attention to the spiritual aspect in medicine. How do we realize the good in medicine? Our focus will be on the approaches, exercises and meditations of the young medical movement, pastoral medicine and the inner path of development of the School of Spiritual Science. For the and Paul Werthmann and many more, together with the International Coordination of Anthroposophic Medicine (IKAM) and the Medical Section team at the Goetheanum.100 Years of Anthropo sophic Medicine The human being is a bridge between the past and future existence. The present is a moment; moment as bridge. Spirit grown to Soul, in matter's husk, comes from the past. Soul growing to Spirit as seed encased, journeys toward the future. Grasp future things through past ones, Hope for evolving things through what has evolved. So grasp existence in evolving growth. So grasp what will be in what exists.

World Conference Celebrating 100 Years of Anthroposophic Medicine September 12 to 20, 2020 at the Goetheanum Updated 2nd Version July 20202 Corona Update Dear Colleagues, dear Friends, In view of the extraordinary world situation, many have been asking whether the World Conference \"Crossing Bridges - Being Human!\" will take place at the Goetheanum from September 12 to 20. Our answer today is yes, we would like to hold this event to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Anthroposophic Medicine! You can register now in writing or via this website. We are following the relevant medical and political develop - ments very closely, which require constant presence of mind, determination and caution. We are aware that for many people it is still unclear whether they will be able to travel to the Goetheanum in September. The regulations for September in Switzerland are currently also changing weekly. Please see our website for information about the current status. In terms of content, the conference theme of building bridges between scientific and moral-spiritual perspectives to arrive at an integrative understanding of the human being and the world seems more topical than ever. We will integrate experiences and perspectives on the pandemic from the point of view of Anthroposophic Medicine into the program and we are also examining the possibility of offering selected online options for those who are excluded by travel regulations. Ideas for preparing the content of the conference can already be found on our website and can be used as a stimu- lus for regional collaboration in advance. How can ideals become a source of strength? How can we work together powerfully for a medical approach that is future-oriented and humane? In view of the current situation, we are ex-tending our early booking discount until July 31, 2020. Cancellation is possible free of charge at any time until the start of the conference. Every registration gives us support in our efforts to realize our carefully prepared conference in the form possible in September, and so we look forward to this special festival event with great anticipation!3The human being is a bridge Between the past And future existence; The present is momentary; The moment as bridge. Rudolf Steiner for Ita Wegman on 24 December 1920 Dear Colleagues, dear Friends from all the health professions, In 2020, Anthroposophic Medicine is celebrating its hundredth anniversary. The classic annual conference at the Goetheanum has therefore been transformed into a festive world conference. It has been in preparation for several years by a group of young people in the Medical Section. Crossing Bridges - Being Human!\" - we warmly invite you to build bridges between body, soul and spirit, between natural science and spiritual science, between the generations, countries and professional groups for an integrative art of healing which puts the human being at its centre. This programme brochure contains information about 30 keynote lectures and more than 100 workshops and specialist courses, making the anthroposophical image of the human being subject to practical experience in medicine through the four elements, ether types and stages of consciousness. How do body and soul interpenetrate one another in the moment of enthusiasm? How does everyday work change when we jointly strive for the ideals of freedom, love and wisdom? What characterises a healthy medical establishment and a health service that does justice to the human being? What understanding of illness, what therapeutic concepts can Anthroposophic Medicine contribute to the various specialisms in the spirit of an integrative medicine? How does the collaboration between different healing professions develop in the process? 100 years of Anthroposophic Medicine also invite us not to stint on the celebration! Be it with lectures or artistic performances, dance and encounters with people from many countries, or with science spaces, panel discussions and future forums which provide space for us to reflect and ask: to what extent can we bring into the present the original impulses of the system of medicine founded by Rudolf Steiner and Ita Wegman? What are the scientific, health policy and therapeutic milestones of the last 100 years? What is our perspective and vision as we face the future? Lastly, we want to turn to the spiritual in medicine: how do we put into practice the good in medicine? In doing so, we address above all the approaches, exercises and meditations of the young physicians movement, of pastoral medicine and the path of inner development of the School of Spiritual Science. We look forward to this week of joint celebration!Dr. Matthias Girke and Georg Soldner for the preparatory team of the world conference, the International Coordination of Anthroposophic Medicine (IKAM) and the team of the Medical Section at the Goetheanum4 8:00 Optional morning courses 9:30 Keynote lectures Prof. Dr. Friedrich Edelh\u00e4userDr. Marion Debus DE* 9:30 Keynote lectures Dr. Johannes Weinzirl, Norman Kingeter DE* 10:30 Break 11:15 Groups for Deepening and Experiencing the Lecture - Nature, Movement, Art and Conversation 12:30 Lunch break 16:00 Break 16:45 Methodical and Therapeutic Specialist Courses in Intergenerational and Interdisciplinary CollaborationSchedUle 1 St half of the week 14:45 World Space Current Initiatives andInternational Projects EN* 14:45 Future Forum - The Pro - fessions and Interprofessional Cooperation DE* 21:00 Night Caf\u00e9 20:00 Spiritual Evening Sessions in Three Groups School of Spiritual Science Saturday, September 12 Sunday, September 13 Monday, September 14 18:00 Evening break 20:00 The Human Being is a Bridge (opening) Preparatory Group Michael-Imagination Goetheanum-Eurythmie- Ensemble 20:00 Artistic Program Compagnie Pas de Deux 9:00 Warmth Acts - Four Elements 9:00 Light Acts - Four Ethers 16:30 Ita Wegman Campus Feast5 * This lecture will be held in the language indicated and simultaneously translated into the following languages: German, English, Italian, French, Spanish, possibly Russian 8:00 Optional morning courses 9:30 Keynote lectures Victoria MartinezDr. David McGavin EN* 9:30 Keynote lecture Dr. Armin Husemann with Camerata Da Vinci DE* 10:30 Break 14:45 Space Perspectives for HealthyMedical Institutions DE* 16:00 Break 16:45 Methodical and Therapeutic Specialist Courses 20:00 Spiritual Evening Sessions in Three Groups School of Spiritual Science 21:00 Night Caf\u00e9 12:30 Lunch break 11:15 Groups for Deepening the Lecture Tuesday, September 15 Wednesday, September 16 18:00 Evening break 11:15 Welcome Festive Address Prof. Dr. Giovanni Maio Festive event - 100 years of Anthroposophic Medicine 12:30 Terrace Feast 14:30 Festive Addresses Prof. Dr. Strings of Light Goetheanum-Eurythmie-Ensemble 18:00 Departure for participants of the 1st half of the week 9:00 Human soul! - Stages of Consciousness 9:00 Physiology of Enthusiasm6 8:00 Optional morning courses 9:30 Keynote lectures Prof. Dr. Peter Heusser Bart Vanmechelen DE* 9:30 Keynote lectures Dr. Lakshmi PrasannaRolf Heine EN* 10:30 Break 11:15 Groups for Deepening and Experiencing the Lecture - Nature, Movement, Art and Conversation 12:30 Lunch break 16:00 Break 16:45 Methodical and Therapeutic Specialist Courses in Intergenerational and Interdisciplinary CollaborationSchedUle 2nd half of the week 14:45 Science Space Milestones, Current Research, Future Studies EN* 14:45 Future Forum Identity and IntegrativeMedical Cooperation DE* 21:00 Night Caf\u00e9 20:00 Spiritual Evening Sessions in Three Groups School of Spiritual Science Thursday, September 17 Friday, September 18 18:00 Evening break Festive event - 100 years of Anthroposophic Medicine Arrival for participants of the 2nd half of the week 9:00 Freedom - Penetrating Appearances 9:00 Love - Overcoming Violence 11:15 Welcome Festive Address Prof. Dr. Giovanni Maio 12:30 Terrace Feast 14:30 Festive Addresses Prof. Dr. Peter Michaela Matthias Girke Break Strings of Light Goetheanum-Eurythmie- Ensemble Wednesday, September 16 20:00 Remembering of the dead 100 Years past and future of Anthroposophic Medicine Dr. Matthias Girke and Georg Soldner Eurythmy - Freies Eurythmie Ensemble & Camerata Da Vinci7 * This lecture will be held in the language indicated and simultaneously translated into the following languages: German, English, Italian, French, Spanish, possibly Russian 8:00 Optional morning courses 9:30 Keynote lectures Dr. Wolfram EngelTom\u00e1 Bonk DE* 10:30 Break 14:45 Open a SalutaryHealthcare System DE* 16:00 Break 16:45 Methodical and Therapeutic Specialist Courses 21:00 Night Caf\u00e9 12:30 Lunch break 11:15 Groups for Deepening the Lecture Saturday, September 19 Sunday, September 20 18:00 Evening break 20:00 Open Stage 11:30 ... the earth would shine out in solar, spiritual radiance 13:00 Departure 9:00 Wisdom - the Resurrection of Substance 9:00 Future Forum for Anthroposophic Medicine from East, West, North, SouthDr. Moon Maglana, Janice Balaskas, Merja Stone Meditation Goetheanum-Eurythmie-Ensemble 10:45 Break8the conference week - a progression in eight stages 100 years ago Rudolf Steiner gave three formative lectures on the inner development of anthroposophical me - dicine. At the centre is the riddle of warmth - a bridge between the four elements and the four types of ether. The warmth ignites the possibility of an infectious enthusiasm for an ideal, allowing light-filled orientation and strength to penetrate our lives. While abstract thoughts and theories paralyze our existence, today it is rather a task of the heart: How can I penetrate myself with an ideal in such a way that it becomes a germ of life and has a strengthening effect on my physicality and my surroundings? These three Bridge lectures\" form the basis for the content of the World Conference on the Centenary of Anthro - posophical Medicine. Day after day we take up motifs and relate them to contemporary medical and therapeutic questions. In this way the conference follows a path from the four elements (Sunday) through the four ethers (Monday) to the levels of human consciousness (Tuesday) and on to the secret of enthusiasm (Wednesday). This opens up the reality of the three great ideals: Freedom in contention with appearances (Thursday), love in conten-tion with violence (Friday) and wisdom in the transformation of substance (Saturday). The conference week is divided into two parts, which can also be attended individually. In its meeting point on Wednesday there will be a ceremony with a terrace festival to mark the centenary of Anthroposophical Medicine. The first part, and thus the whole conference, begins with the Bridge verse\" (see p. 15) by the ensemble amwort, which will accompany us throughout the conference, presented in various languages. After the preparatory team has prepared the conference, Georg Soldner and Matthias Girke will set the first focus of the conference. The prelu-de will conclude with the Michael Imagination performed by the Goetheanum Eurythmy Ensemble. The second part will be opened by a Halleluiah by the Free Eurythmy Ensemble, which will be the entrance to the second half of the conference. The subsequent remembering of the dead will be conducted by Georg Soldner. This is followed by the invocation of Raphael by Bernard Lievegoed eurythmically performed by the aforementioned ensemble, before Matthias Girke directs the view to spiritual guiding stars of anthroposophical medicine. The unity ends with the 2nd movement from Beethoven's 5th Piano Concerto with the musicians of the Camerata Da Vinci and the Free Eurythmy Ensemble. The conference ends of Sunday 20 September with a forum on the future of Anthroposophic Medicine over the next 100 years. Four women - Merja Riij\u00e4rvi (Finland), Iracema Benevides (Brazil), Moon Maglana (Philippines) and Janice Balaskas (USA) - will tell us about their perspectives, hopes and wishes for the future of the anthroposophical medical movement. The Foundation Stone Meditation performed by the Goetheanum Stage Ensemble and a contribution from the preparatory team (... the earth would shine out in solar, spiritual radiance) will then conclude the world conference. 9the conference days - the course of each day For early risers, each day starts at 8.00 with optional morning courses on movement, music, speech and medi- tation. At 9.00 the preparatory team will give an introduction to the motif for the day which is followed by two keynote lectures which are then deepened in workshops starting at 11.15 (experiencing nature, movement, art and conversation). After the lunch break, there are events at 14.45 on science, multidisciplinary collaboration and current health policy before from 16.45 onwards the focus turns to work in specialist medical courses on the methods and practice of Anthroposophic Medicine. Starting at 20.00 in the evening, artistic performances alternate with contributions on the spiritual dimension of medicine. Here there are always three choices available. This is followed by the Night Caf\u00e9 inviting everyone to bring the day to an end with a social gathering and dancing. festive event - 100 years of anthroposophic Medicine On Wednesday we will celebrate the hundredth anniversary of Anthroposophic Medicine with a festive event. The speakers include Prof Dr Giovanni Maio, Prof Dr Peter Selg, Dr Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler, Dr Matthias Girke and Georg Soldner. In addition we can look forward to artistic contributions, there will be a commemoration of the dead, as well as a terrace festival with the opportunity to meet other participants, particularly also the representatives of the International Coordination of Anthroposophic Medicine (IKAM). The festive event can be attended with all conference tickets (whole week, part 1 and part 2). In the evening, the second part of the conference week will open festively with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony (in D Minor, Op. 125) performed by the Neue Orchester Basel and choir. open stage - cultural diversity The last evening of our conference has been organised as an open stage\" for everyone: all participants are warmly invited - individually or with others - to perform an artistic contribution! This contribution can be spontaneously rehearsed at the conference or prepared in advance. It can feature the cultural wealth of a country, take up a situation at the conference, artistically deepen the conference content or make other participants laugh - both reflective and humorous contributions are welcome! Contributions can be sent to openstage@crossingbridges.care and should be restricted to a maximum of five minutes. Depending on the number of submissions, the preparatory team reserves the right to make a selection. exhibitions - science, initiatives and art Poster exhibition on research and studies in Anthroposophic Medicine Posters on current scientific work in Anthroposophic Medicine and thus all caring and therapeutic professions can be exhibited at the world conference. We would ask interested research institutes to prepare studies or alternatively an overview of the main research areas of the institute as posters. To submit a poster please send the abstract to 10science@crossingbridges.care. In the second half of the week, there will be poster sessions in the break from 16.00- 16.45. We would ask exhibitors to be at their posters at this time so they can answer questions. Poster exhibitions on worldwide initiatives in Anthroposophic Medicine In the World Space\" on Sunday we want to give an overview of globally relevant initiatives, projects and petitions of Anthroposophic Medicine. In addition, young initiatives can exhibit their project with a poster. For the submissi-on of a poster please send a summary to initiative@crossingbridges.care. In the first half of the week, there will be poster sessions in the break from 16.00-16.45. We would ask the people responsible to be at their posters at this time so they can answer questions. Art exhibition on the conference From the art of healing through art therapy to the visual arts - this bridge, too, we wish to build. Art affects people, it can be health-giving but also make us ill. The bridge between medicine and art is to be made visible at the conference in the form of an exhibition which can be visited at the Goetheanum and for which there will be guided tours. It is di - vided into two parts. The first looks at the past, what is there already: 100 years of Anthroposophic Medicine, historical documents, picture material and objects. The second part will thematically follow the course of the conference. It will bring visibility, based on the Bridge lectures, to each day's theme and direct our eye from the present to the future. Special edition - Rudolf Steiner's Bridge lectures I am currently circulating the December 1920 lectures and Hygiene among people so that everyone will have read them by the time of the course. \" RUDOLF STEINER VERLAG DES ITA WEGMAN INSTITUTSThree lectures, given on 17, 18 and 19 December 1920 in Dornach THE BRIDGE FROM THE PHYSICAL TO THE SPIRITUAL AND MORALHelene von Grunelius in preparing the first course for young medics Rudolf Steiner's Bridge lectures have been republished in English and German as a special edition by the Ita Wegman Verlag. The booklet appears under the title The Bridge from the Physical to the Spiritual and Moral\" . It is available for \u20ac15 / CHF 18 and can be acquired as of now from bookshops, from book@crossingbridges.care or also at the conference itself. Translations in Spanish, Italian and French are available; translations in Russian, Chinese and Arabic are in preparation. 11 the preparatory group How did the preparatory group for the world conference come together and develop? On a sunny afternoon in June 2017, a motley group of young people met at the Goetheanum in Dornach. All of them had followed the invitation to come together to dream and so approximately twenty-five young people from the greatest variety of professional groups (medicine, nursing, obstetrics, special needs education/ social care, social therapy, pharmacy, art and music therapy, teaching) dreamt of something communal, something that would connect the world. The impulse for this followed on from the international young medics conference Enlightening the heart\" which took place at the Goetheanum in 2013. Some of the people attending the meeting had been at that conference or, indeed, helped to organise it, some were completely new. Might a similar event not be held seven years later - that was the thought. The impulse of a joint conference was met with enthusiasm and led to a colourful wall covered with ideas and visions. Rudolf Steiner's Bridge lectures and the motif of the bridge had also already been brought up. Yet a good year was to pass in which the thematic foundation, commonalities and differences, goals and ideals were wrestled with until everyone finally came to the joint decision to use the Bridge lectures as the basis of our conference. Many questions were considered during this time. What connects the different professional groups, what differen- tiates them? How does a common spirit arise without well-founded professional differences being lost? What are 12the questions and needs of our time? How can a bridge be built between cultures, countries and continents? How between generations? What is the connecting element between people who have only just met and developed an interest in the anthroposophical movement and those who have engaged with it intensively for decades? In the following three years the preparatory group met repeatedly in different constellations and places. In this process the second key motif to appear was the Staff of Mercury and we engaged more deeply with its content as a group. In this context we worked on the Michael and Raphael impulse in medicine and were grateful how these two streams found their way to one another. This was evident even in the smallest tasks, such as the graphic design of a flyer. We are, for example, very happy about the new logo for a hundred years of Anthroposophic Medicine which depicts the Staff of Mercury in a noble, clear and upright fashion. The International Coordination of Anthroposophic Medicine (IKAM) and the Medical Section placed great trust in us and in the course of the intensive study of the Bridge lectures, which always accompanied our meetings, also in their content, we developed the vision of a festive world conference to celebrate the occasion of one hundred years of Anthroposophic Medicine. This world conference is now no longer intended just for the young generation but for all people who feel a connection with Anthroposophic Medicine throughout the world. Following the arc of the Bridge lectures in its content, and thus building on the previous annual conferences of the Medical Section (Living Warmth, Living Light, Human Soul!), it wishes to prepare the ground for the and Paul Werthmann 13 From the graphical development process - The Caduceus designed by Rozemariken Scheffers 1314 From the graphical development process - The Caduceus designed by Barbara SchnetzlerThe human being is a bridge Between the past And future existence; The present is momentary; The moment as bridge.Spirit turned to soul In matter's shell,It comes from the past; Soul turning to spiritIn seed encased,It is future bound.

Rudolf Steiner for Ita Wegman, Christmas, 24 December 1920 1516 optional morning courses, 08.00-08.45 For all early risers who want to start the day together, a selection of courses is offered punctually at eight. Through movement, music, speech or meditation - there is something for everyone so that they can afterwards brightly attune themselves to the day's topic in the Gro\u00dfe Saal. Registration for the optional courses is requested. M1. enlivening speech. Sibylle Eichstaedt en Enlivening speech: exercises and poetry with a therapeutic background, but in this context intended as an awakening, artistic-playful morning activity at the start of each of our intense days of working together. M2. n ew perspectives through form drawing. Peter B\u00fcchi de/en/fR With simple means and without prior conditions, therapeutic form drawing offers many approaches to sensory development and care. Active loo - king is intensively supported and a living relationship with the world of the senses established. By making finished forms capable of experience as living movement, a subtle sense of form arises through doing as the basis for a new encounter with the world. M3. Musical therapeutic improvisation on the topic for the day. Laura Piffaretti, Anna-Barbara Hess de/en/It We will take up the topic for the day with instruments, the voice and musical elements from anth- roposophical music therapy, and as we improvise together give expression to it in sound and bring it to experience. No prior musical knowledge is required. Participation can be active or by listening. M4. l and- art. Ulrikke Stokholm de/en/dk In nature of the Goetheanum grounds we will encounter the coming day through our attentive senses. They open up for us the play of the elements and ethers in each of their unique encounters. With this impression we will cautiously enter into an interchange with nature by sensitively introducing our own expression with its materials and elements into its ensemble. And will listen for its response. Important: wear clothing appropriate for the weather. Introduction in front of the main entrance of the Goethe - anum (West) punctually at 8.00 each day. Please do not join later since this may disturb the absorption of the participants. M5. l oheland gymnastics / movement training. Sabine Podehl, Simone Koring de/en Loheland mo - vement training enables human beings to experience their innate laws and to place them in the context of space and time in such a way that freedom, ability to act, as well as responsibility for our own actions and in social coexistence can be directly experienced. In the upright posture from our own standpoint we move into the space. In our course we will focus on an experience and exploration of uprightness. Finding our own standpoint, its place between heaviness and lightness. Arriving at ourselves, to enter into an encounter with ourselves and the other participants.17M6. Singing in the western stairwell. Viola Heckel M.A. de/en Singing is an element of life which gives us pleasure, inner freedom and human belonging. Exercises from the school for uncovering the voice of Valborg Werbeck-Sv\u00e4rdstr\u00f6m stimulate the perception of tone, breathing and sounds and enliven the voice. In addition we will take delight in songs, improvisations and the sound of multiple voices in the choir. The goal of the course is to have a direct experience of the regenerating forces of singing. The course is open to everyone who likes singing. No previous knowledge is necessary. M7. e urythmy: movement as the location of self-knowledge Libertad Aguilar de/eS Eurythmy allows us to develop the ability to know about ourselves in relation to our own movement but also in relation to the cosmos and nature. For this reason this course offers movement sequences for everyday practice and self-knowledge out of an understanding of the creative forces and through simple group and individual choreographic movements, enabling the visualisation of soul tendencies with regard to the relationship with the other person and the environment. M8. Spacial d ynamics\u00ae. Dr. med. Christina Spitta, Gabriele Hurter, McMillan de/en Refreshing and vitalising movement exercises to attune to the day - with aspects relating to the respective topic for the day. Jaimen McMillan will join the team in the second half of the conference. M9. Starting the day deliberately with joy in movement - yoga in accordance with the n ew Yoga w ill. Judith Leikam de/It \" An asana is always a static movement, a finished form into which the body is led very deliberately. In this field of work the creative shaping of meaning appears like a supporting pillar which leads to the illumination of the personality and moves it closer to the unity and integration of spirit and life. \" Heinz Grill. Yoga in accordance with the New Yoga Will as an integrative path from above downwards, from the spirit via the activation of the soul forces to expression in the body: in deliberately shaping our movement we will tangibly approach the daily topic each morning. No previous knowledge is necessary. M10. Bothmer\u00aeGymnastics: movement as a bridge. Jessie Delage, Sabine Nagel en/de We will open the day through movement, movement as a bridge to the body, to the space, to the others. Bothmer gymnastics, guided by the I consciousness, helps us to perceive and to grasp our own body while opening it to the forces of space that structure it. This opening allows us to meet others in a movement that is both individual and collective. In this way a bridge will be built to the other persons, practicing together is a deep and wonderful experience. Individuals, pairs and group exercises. M11. Mind-body knowledge of the human being: Meditation for self and world experience. Prof. Dr. med. David Martin, Dr. med. Silke Schwarz en/de When you first looked into a microscope as a medical student you probably just saw blobs of colour. In fact, you first had to learn to focus your microscope on the right level, with the right lighting, etc. If you had a skilled teacher and good equipment, you will have been able to catch up 300 years of microscopy development within a few decades. Meditation is similar, except that it is a macroscope into the world of being. Come join us on the path to self and world realisation. optional morning courses, 08.00-08.4518attunement to the day and keynote lectures, 09.00-10.30 In attunement to the day, a motif from the Bridge lectures will be introduced by the preparatory group in the Gro\u00dfe Saal each day. Two keynote lectures will pick this up and relate it to the medical and therapeutic understanding of the human being or medical and therapeutic practice. Sunday: living warmth - four elements The four elements in nature and the human being Prof. Dr. Friedrich Edelh\u00e4user Warmth as an element in the therapeutic relationship Dr. Marion Debus Monday: living light - four ethers The four ethers from the perspective of natural science Dr. Johannes Weinzirl Four ethers - perspectives and demonstration from eurythmy Norman Kingeter tuesday: human soul! - stages of growing consciousness Consciousness and pain medicine Dr. David McGavin Trauma, silent suffering Victoria Mart\u00ednez wednesday: the physiology of enthusiasm The musical structure of the human being demonstrated with the second movement of Beethoven's 5th Piano Concerto Dr. Armin Husemann with Camerata Da Vinci thursday: f reedom - penetrating appearances From appearance to being. Freedom in the age of Michael Prof. Dr. Peter Heusser Esoteric courage - practising freedom to commit oneself Bart Vanmechelen friday: l ove - overcoming violence The human contribution to the becoming of love - from a medical and nursing view Rolf Heine, Dr. Lakshmi Prasanna Saturday: wisdom - resurrection of substance Death and resurrection in the laboratory and at the altar Dr. Wolfram Engel, Tom\u00e1 Bonk19 deepening groups in the 1st half of the week, 11.15-12.30 This is where the choice of deepening groups for the first half of the week can be found. In these workshops the motif for the day is deepened in art and movement therapies, nature and Goethean observation, experiential and experimental modes of work as well as text and dialogical forms of working. When registering, please select three groups specifying your preference. Short biographies of the workshop leaders and further information can be found at www.crossingbridges.care X12. Music as entry to the sound ether of chemistry. Dr. Armin Husemann de With musical listening exercises and examples at the piano we will work on music as the revelation of the secret laws of chemistry. X13. the invisible human being in us - diagnosis. Philipp Busche de Every treatment is based on a clear diagnosis. How can this be done when the invisible aspects of the human being must be taken into account? Building on the lectures, we will consider issues of medical history and aspects of physical examination to come to a systematically developed diagnosis of the human constitutional elements. The course will contain small exercises and case work to ensure the greatest possible relevance to practice. X14. architecture, art and therapy. Prof. Dr. phil. Reinhold J. F\u00e4th de/en With reference to the content of each day's topics - the four elements (day 1), the ether types (day 2), the stages of consciousness (day 3) - this workshop will concern itself with the effects of architecture, interior design and design. We will clarify these terms in the context of \"art\" and with regard to the human constitutional elements, and will discuss possible uses in art therapy. Specific questions from participants are welcome and will as far as possible be included. X15. anthroposophical meditation. Dr. Christoph Hueck de/en The topics of the preceding lectures - elements, ether types and stages of consciousness - will be meditatively deepened. At the same time this workshop is an introduction to the method and background of anthroposophical meditation. Suitable both for beginners and also those who are more advanced. X16. the etheric in nature. Carmen Eppel, Dr. med. U. Geyer de/en Nature is our teacher in the search for the etheric: cloud formations in the sky, the mood in a landscape, and above all the plants in their many different forms. We will concern ourselves specifically with the formative gestures of the four types of ether, gather expe - riences out in nature, follow them up using the example of medicinal plants and develop a perception of their healing efficacy. X17. o phthalmic eurythmy therapy. Margret Thiersch de/en The eye as our sensory organ for light is located in the eye socket - embedded in warmth - and is thereby connected with the whole warmth organism of the human being. The sight of the eyes extends, like the movement of the arms, into the surroundings and, like the latter, in health returns to the centre as in breathing. In polar opposition to sight, the feet \"see\" into gravity. Through their relationship with the surroundings and the centre, the tone movements of the limbs can have a healing effect on the eyes. The alternating view of polar colours during the exercises supports this effect. Practice in the treatment of increasing short-sightedness and retinal degeneration. 1920X18. experiencing the action of the four elements and four ether types, and therein I de - velopment, in biography work, and making use of it in the therapeutic discussion. Dr. med. Susanne Hofmeister de/en The course of our life displays the same laws in time which form the human body. Knowing the action of the I in our biography leads to a deeper understanding of health and illness. We will describe the qualities of the four elements and the four ether types in the course of our life to 21 and the transformation of the soul qualities to the age of 42. We will familiarise ourselves with the transformation into spiritual qualities as the opportunity for self-realisation after 42. After 63 a personal vision of the future is required so that a \"rejuvena-tion\" of the etheric forces into the future space becomes possible. X19. d ynamic processes in eurythmy therapy. Norman Kingeter, M.A., en/de Marjorie Spock elabora- ted movement forms for deepening the understanding of the four ethers. Based on this and other exercises, we will look at the dynamics in eurythmy therapy exercises. The goal is to develop an expanded approach to therapeutic processes. X20. c raniosacral osteopathy as bridge to perception of the etheric. Birgit Faller, Gabriele F\u00f6rster de/en In craniosacral osteopathy we learn to come into contact through touch with the etheric forces in and around us. Windows open to diagnosis in our understanding of the human being in general as well as in certain organ structures, extending as far as identifying remedies. The willingness to touch one another is a prerequisite. Comfortable clothing desirable. X21. Modelling: I mould the earth - the earth moulds me. Michaela Schulz-Matan de On the one hand we will mould the earth material with our hands and act on it creatively in various processes. On the other we will interrogate our interior as to what these processes have moved in it and what it experienced in reaction. In the subsequent discussion about the inner and outer experience we will then build the bridge in \"communication\" and \"perception\" from myself to the world, from I to you. No previous modelling knowledge required. X22. Rhythmical einreibung and the ether types. Rebekka Lang, Janice Balaskas en/de In harmony with the lecture topic in the morning, we will investigate the various ether types and their reality in rhythmical Einreibung. We will work practically but also keep linking to the theory. X23. Pharmacy experience workshop. Albert Schmidli, Dott.ssa Laura Borghi en/de Phenomenological, phar - maceutical and therapeutic walk through the warmth stages of anthroposophical pharmacy with vivid demonstrations. The focus is on the process of digestion as well as drying, roasting, carbonising and ashing, including the medicines of An - throposophic Medicine produced by these processes with an exchange of experiences about therapy. In conclusion we will look at the warmth led production of Cinis capsellae comp., one of the most spiritual medicines given by Rudolf Steiner. X26. the motifs of the days - understanding, deepening, wisdom. Moritz Christoph de/en/fR We will look back at the morning contribution together. What questions were ignited? What further aspects do we want to add to the motif for the day? We will look at the relevant passages in the Bridge lectures and deepen them through our experiences as well as scientific aspects. The Bridge lectures of 17, 18 and 19 December 1920 as well as the collection of quotes on the conference page may be used for preparation. The workshop aims to deepen the motif for the day through aspects of content and the exchange of views. deepening groups in the 1st half of the week, 11.15-12.3021 deepening groups in the 1st half of the week, 11.15-12.30 X27. Practical experience with external treatments in relation to warmth, light, body and soul. Astrid Sterner, Christiane Eberhardt de/en The external treatments are a central element of Anthroposo - phic Medicine. As therapy they directly and without mediation bring to bear the elements of earth - water - air - warmth - light on body and soul via the I organisation. In this course we will experience these elements for ourselves with external treatments. X28. the life processes in the mirror of the elements, of body and soul. Martin-G\u00fcnther Sterner, Noemi B\u00f6ken de/en/RU Human life unfolds in seven clearly separated processes which physically underlie the physiology and mentally underlie consciousness. As \"events\" , they guide the substances at the levels of the ele - ments through the human constitutional elements, the \"invisible\" human being. In pictorial reflections on bodily physiological as well as mentally cognitive processes, and in the experience of eurythmy, we will develop a funda-mental insight into the world of the life processes. X30. h ow do the etheric forces take effect in oil dispersion baths? Dr. Markus Kr\u00fcger, Beate Motte de Bathing in etheric forces. What are the etheric forces? How do they reveal themselves specifically in oil dis- persion baths? What does \"etherisation of the bath water\" mean? How are the etheric forces of medicinal plants unlocked in oil dispersion baths? How do they become accessible to the patient in oil dispersion baths? How can the etheric forces be absorbed in bathing and unfold their healing action in the human being? We will deepen these question in the workshop through the experience of practical exercises and in discussion. X31. the mutually reinforcing healing power of anthroposophic Medicine and anthroposo - phic psychotherapy: anamnesis, healing, healing crisis and recovery. Dr. phil. John Lees, Dr. med. Romulo de Mello Silva en The workshop will examine how the mutually supporting interventions of Anthropo - sophic Medicine and anthroposophic psychotherapy create healing care circles around patients both in waking and sleep life in order to maximize the effect of both interventions. The focus will be on the psychological and psychosomatic consequences of trauma. The workshop will use case studies to demonstrate the importance of working with the client's healthy I, bridging earthly and spiritual life by quickening moral ideals, establishing healthy connections with the outer world, despite the difficult world situation, and the challenges of recovery. X33. Stepwise from sense perception to imagination. Torsten Arncken en The qualities of the four elements will be observed in the taste of different salts. We actively symbolise their inner qualities and bring them to our conscious mind. The second day we will differentiate the medicinal effects of two species of Echinacea. We will taste the plants and connect their overall phenomenology with their natural environment. We will observe the four etheric forces in the metamorphosis of plants and humans. The third day we will symbolise the scent of plants, fertilised with metals. Thus, we will experience planetary beings. X34. Passing warmth and light into music flowing from inside to outside. Aihua Lee cn Music touches our soul when we hear it. It transfers the spiritual impulses into our bodies. When the light is here, we might feel relieved and then we breath out. We may cry in empathy because of the warmth which is expressed by the music. What instruments could bring up a warm quality? In certain music keys we feel there is more \"light\" in them. Could it be possible that on one instrument we could express both light and warm qualities?22 deepening groups in the 1st half of the week, 11.15-12.30 X36. Bending and stretching as healing principle in eurythmy therapy and medicine. Judit Kedves, Hana Adamcov\u00e1, M.A. de/cZ Starting from the \"bending and stretching\" exercises, we aim to bring the topics of the morning keynote lectures to experience in movement. There will be time to reflect on the effect of the exercises. Ways into practice will be illustrated using the medical and therapeutic aspects following on from this. In this way eurythmy therapy can become a bridge to a deeper therapeutic understanding. Don't forget your eurythmy shoes!23 deepening groups in the 2nd half of the week, 11.15-12.30 This is where the choice of deepening groups for the second half of the week can be found. In these workshops the motif for the day is deepened in art and movement therapies, nature and Goethean observation, experiential and experimental mo - des of work as well as text and dialogical forms of working. When registering ple - ase select three groups specifying your preference. Short biographies of the work - shop leaders and further information can be found at www.crossingbridges.care X63. the invisible human being - therapy. Philipp Busche de An understanding of the human constitu- tional elements can deepen diagnosis and thus extend the understanding of medical needs. What consequences does that have for therapy? What perspectives can help to draw up a therapeutic concept which takes account of the aspects of the visible and invisible human being? The aim of the workshop is to deal with and exchange views on such questions through keynote contributions, exercises and in conversation. It is a practice-based workshop. X64. the realisation of freedom, love and wisdom in professional nursing. Jacqueline Goldberg, S\u00f6ren Hirning-Goldberg de Day 1: Nursing actions are standardised, nursing organisations regulated by law and liability. How can freedom arise here? Day 2: Rudolf Steiner wanted to give a course about nursing work as \"wor-king love\" . That (no longer) happened. What does that mean for the individual nursing situation and the nursing community? Day 3: Future impulses for anthroposophic nursing between equanimity and courage. These three motifs will be considered together on the three days in the colloquium. X65. extension of psychotherapy through anthroposophy - following-up on lectures. Dr. Ad Dekkers, Dr. Henriette Dekkers-Appel de/en/nl Short presentation on the subject, exercises, results and dis- cussion. X66. therapeutic speech. Esther B\u00f6ttcher, Dietrich von Bonin de We will concern ourselves with deepening the conference topic through speech, breathing, the voice and movement as shaping the relationship between I and You, I and the world. In shaping speech with myself and with the You, can this give rise to an intimation of the healing power of the ideals of freedom, love and wisdom? How do we come to a language from the middle, a language of the heart? X67. anthropophonetics: healing from out of the musical and sound structure of the human being. Anna Zei\u00df, Christoph Broens de In the harmony of tones, sounds and touch (forms stroked on the body with the hands), anthropophonetics has a harmonising effect on the human constitutional elements. The course will deepen that and bring it to experience through exercises. The topics of the keynote lectures on each day will also be taken up from this perspective. The workshop will deal with the difference of anthropophonetics for physi-cians in contrast to the approach for therapists.24X68. Metal colour light therapy - perspectives of transformation. Friedlinde Meier, Clothilde Bernard, Lucien Turci de/en/fR/Se We aim to look at the effects of sunlight, colour and metal by our own observations of metal colour light glass. Can we find freedom - love - wisdom in the encounter with metal colour light? How do we experience light and shadow in the glass? What therapeutic effects do we experience in the rhythmicised, translucent colours and their afterimages? How do we respond to the metal transformed into colour? Glass the rainbow as bridge, artistic exercises with the rainbow in art therapy as developed by Margarete hauschka using plant colours. Elisa Dudinsky de/en The inner rainbow as a double inversion in the etheric and astral body represents the action of colour in the human being. Artistic exercises will be carried out with this in mind which go back to the work of Margarete Hauschka. The rainbow is seen as the archetypal image of the connection of the human being from the earthly to the spiritual world. The action of the colours of the rainbow always display perfect harmony through the use of which people can feel themselves more fulfilled, blocks can be dissolved and healing processes stimulated. X70. Phenomenological reflections on the nature and embryology of the human being for an understanding of freedom, love and wisdom. Dr. med. Guus van der Bie de/en Using human embryological development, we will seek to trace the action of higher organisational levels (human constitutional elements). A Goethean and phenomenological way of observation opens possibilities of learning to \"read\" the action of these constitutional elements in creating bodily form, as a result of which form can acquire meaning. Every form arises from bodily substance in motion. We will relate these movements to freedom, wisdom and love. The human form is a unique phenomenon within the realms of nature for an understanding of the human qualities in their bodily manifestation. X71. desire to help and will to heal - where is my spiritual home? Rolf Heine de/en As physicians, nurses or therapists we realise a professional biography. It has a long history and is preparing a new culture. What made us become a physician, nurse or therapist? How do we integrate our wider interests in life into life alongside our profession? Is there an individual - and a joint - spiritual mission of our healing professions? We will work in small groups, read short text extracts, ask questions, listen, struggle for answers, find joint perspectives - perhaps ways. Literature: Rudolf Steiner, GA 172, The Karma of Vocation, lectures 4 and 5 of 12/13 November 1916. X72. Reflecting on therapeutic aspects of freedom, love, wisdom. PhD Dr. Henrik Szke, Jaimen McMillen, Dr. med. Christina Spitta de/en With each therapeutic action we move in the field of professional empathy. What are the realities of an action permeated with spiritual science which is undertaken in freedom, love and wisdom? How can deepened insights be advocated and communicated in today's environment within the tension between the \"objective evidence\" of the health system and free intuitive action responsibly taken? We will \"move\" these question during the workshop with a keynote lecture, discussion and movement. X73. the event as a bridge - biographic counceling. Sylke Ober-Br\u00f6dlin, Siegfried Ober de In the work with concrete biographical events we will consider the topics: 1. Experiencing moments of freedom in our own biography. 2. Understanding our own biography in the \"love of doing\" . 3. Discovering moral intuition (wis-dom) in our own biography. Eurythmy exercises will encourage and clarify these processes. deepening groups in the 2nd half of the week, 11.15-12.3025X74. the motifs of the days - understanding, deepening, wisdom. Moritz Christoph de/en/fR We will look back at the morning contribution together. What questions were ignited? What further aspects do we want to add to the motif for the day? We will look at the relevant passages in the Bridge lectures and deepen them through our experiences as well as scientific aspects. The Bridge lectures of 17, 18 and 19 December 1920 as well as the collection of quotes on the conference page may be used for preparation. The workshop aims to deepen the motif for the day through aspects of content and the exchange of views. X75. \"f reedom wisdom love\" and therapy. Evelyn F . Warnet de The ideals of the twelfth lecture \"freedom wisdom love\" will be related to the foundations of eurythmy therapy of thinking, feeling and will.X76. o rgan - soul - medicine. the connection between organ processes and eurythmy. Noemi B\u00f6ken, Dr. Olaf Koob de/en The four metereological organs (lungs, liver, kidneys and heart) and their sympto - matology in health and illness, accompanied by eurythmy.X77. o rgan einreibungen. Marko Roknic, Petra Roknic de Demonstration of individual organ Einreibung. How important is devotion in carrying out organ Einreibung? How can I approach the qualities of organ Einrei- bung? Exercises. X78. Supersensory observations on the human being. Frank Burdich, Inessa Burdich de Every per- son is much nearer to the possibility of perceiving the supersensory than they normally think. In this course me - thods of perceiving the supersensory will be shown, practised and applied to the observation of the human being. The course leaders will also report from the practice of observing the supersensory constitution of the human being and their illnesses. X79. f reedom, love, wisdom in movement therapy. Stephan Thilo, Jane Johansen de/en/fR In movement we encounter the world through the lower senses, the content of which we raise to consciousness, thereby being able to achieve freedom in movement and action. Moving in freedom creates an encounter with the world, with the other and ourselves. The words are written on the temple of Apollo in Delphi: \"Know thyself\" . Through Bothmer movement exercises we will approach this wisdom and ponder the current questions of the morning lectures. Using simple and meaningful exercises, we will investigate the influence of the soul and spiritual element on the movement event and work on the therapeutic potential of freedom, love and wisdom. X80. life processes and nutrition in the light of freedom, love and wisdom. Martin-G\u00fcnther Sterner, Iracema Benevides de/en In nutrition, through which human beings unite themselves substantially with their environment and the cosmos, the human being stands between freedom and rules, between enjoyment and rejection, between drives and reason. These substances are transformed in seven demarcated processes and led at the element level through the constitutional elements, the \"invisible\" human being, as \"events\" . On the basis of these life processes (see part I of the workshop, but participation in part II also possible without part I), we will learn to understand forms of nutrition better in prevention, therapy and aftercare, to use them more precisely and to handle them with greater freedom. deepening groups in the 2nd half of the week, 11.15-12.3026 deepening groups in the 2nd half of the week, 11.15-12.30 X81. Pharmaceutical processes and medicines. Dr. med. Severin P\u00f6chtrager, Judit Kedves de What is required to turn a natural substance into a medicine? In this workshop-like course we will concern ourselves with individual natural substances, their pharmaceutical processing and clinical use. In doing so, we want to observe the qualities of individual pharmaceutical processes and build a bridge to the anthroposophical understanding of the human being. This bridge is intended to help us also to take account of the pharmaceutical process in the choice of medicine together with the substance. X83. e lementary healthcare and elementary therapy. Ute K\u00f6ncke, Ute Hild de/en/RU Archetypal forms of healing work in basic forms of care in a sustained fashion on self-regulation, above in the field of the life forces, through stimulating the body's own warmth and a minimum of independent movement. In each day's specific motif of freedom, love and wisdom, specific applications will be presented and instruction given. In addi-tion, usage reports and case studies from clinical, therapeutic and lifeworld realms of experience will be discussed including aspects of natural and spiritual science. X84. Rhythm - in freedom, love and wisdom. Irmela Berger-Beyer, Conrad Lorenz de The nature of rhythm; the way to imbue the therapies of Anthroposophic Medicine with the spirit of Christ; with practical examples of rhythmical Einreibung / rhythmical massage therapy as developed by Dr Ita Wegman and Dr Mar-garethe Hauschka as well as supplementary art appreciation. In all therapies of Anthroposophic Medicine, the breathing dialogue between microcosm and macrocosm is fundamental. We invite you to a deepening interdis-ciplinary exchange of views on the phenomena of rhythm in the human being, in doing, in the picture and in the Foundation Stone. X85. h ealing by freedom: crossing the abyss between soul and spirit. T atiana Pavlova en/RU Fear of the spirit is one of the biggest problems nowadays. The fact that free human will mostly is not used for free deeds leads to the transformation of the potential for freedom into illnesses. Anthroposophical psychotherapy, based on Rudolf Steiner's Philosophy of Freedom, helps to understand spirit (ethical monism), experience spirit (moral forces in destiny) and perceive spirit (sense of truth) by working to strengthen the soul through looking for drops of real freedom in everyday life. In our workshop we will consider how this can be done in the therapy process and the relationship with patients and share our experiences. X25. deepening and connecting through drawing. Rozemariken Scheffers, Margarethe Gesell de/ nl Using various avenues of drawing, we aim to discover bridges between body and soul, between outside and inside, between one another. X86. f reedom, love, wisdom - the parts and the whole - a music therapy search. Yael Barak en We will try to widen our experience of the qualities of freedom, love and wisdom through musical activities. Improvising and composing - using melody, harmony and rhythm. Please bring your own instruments and voice. We will look for these three qualities in music therapy, especially in therapy with cancer patients.27 Spaces for science, collaboration and health policy 14.45-16.00 In the afternoon, our attention turns to topical questions and needs of current medicine and health policy. What globally relevant initiatives, projects and petitions are there currently? How do we develop collaboration between the individual health professions which is appropriate for our time, but also between various integrative medical approaches and systems? What does the future of a healthy outpatient or clinical facility look like and a health system fit for human beings? These units will take place in an open form as presentations, panel discussions and plenary discussions. Manufacturer's clinic - tuesday & thursday 14.45 to 16.00 On two days, there will additionally be a moderated forum at which those in positions of responsibility at the manufacturers Abnoba, Helixor, Iscador, Wala and Weleda will give short presentations on current topics in their companies and answer questions that have been brought along. The focus of the event will be on dialogue bet-ween the manufacturers and participants. deepening groups in the 2nd half of the week, 11.15-12.3028Specialist courses in the 1st half of the week, 16.45-18.00 This is where the specialist courses on methods and therapy in the first half of the week can be found. The specialist courses address themselves to the methods of An-throposophic Medicine as well as concrete diagnostic and therapeutic applications for everyday practice. They take up the current CARE topics of the Medical Section or have a specific professional orientation in line with the areas of the International Coordination of Anthroposophic Medicine (IKAM)). Any prior requirements for the work will be set out in the description of the course concerned. When registering ple - ase select three groups specifying your preference. Short biographies of the work - shop leaders and further information can be found at www.crossingbridges.care S38. Immunology in early childhood - childhood diseases - vaccination questions. Georg Soldner de/en The topic is the development of the immune system which is closely connected with the child's warmth organisation. How does vaccination influence this development? What role is played by the time when the vaccination is given, what role by the type of vaccine? What, on the other hand, supports immunological deve - lopment and what role is played in this by acute diseases in early childhood? How does Anthroposophic Medicine give us a deeper understanding here, how can we advise parents and support children? S39. Being an inclusion artist - on the trail of the hidden I. Sonja Zausch, Bart Vanmechelen de/ en/Be Training perception and practising artistically, we aim for a closer understanding of what we need to do to support special needs. What attitude is required, what does support mean and what do we understand by development? With meditative and eurythmy exercises. S40. anthroposophic breathing and movement therapy in lung cancer patients - a feasible modality in hospital units? Dietrich von Bonin, MME, Dr. med. Christian Grah en/de Results of an ob - servational study in a German pneumo-oncological centre: Feasibility and dosage of multimodal anthroposophic complex therapy in lung-cancer patients. Presentation and practical training of breathing exercises using sound (Anthroposophic Therapeutic Speech ATS) and music therapy. S41. \"Musicament\" tao tones - working musically from the etheric into the organic. Laura Piffaretti, Monica Bissegger de/en We intend to study Rudolf Steiner's remarks about the TAO tones and their deepening by various music therapists, particularly with regard to the elements, the ether types and their action on the soul and body of the ill person. We will make the various therapeutic approaches sound and discuss relevant case studies. This work is aimed at music therapists and people with a basic knowledge of music. S42. o ncological case presentations - innovative Maike Presentation and discussion of innovative mistletoe treatments from private medical practice and their publication as case reports.29S43. age culture and elderly care: initiatives and experiences from all over the world. Sabine Ringer, Dipl.-P\u00e4d. Dr. Gerhard Herz de/en Age culture and elderly care remain relevant due to demographic deve - lopments. We will gather initiatives worldwide which concern themselves specifically with ageing and support in old age. The aim is to create awareness through the reports of what can serve as a source of strength. It is expressly desi - red that flyers and/or descriptions and photos are brought along or sent in advance in order to obtain a living picture. S44. warmth in nursing. Carola Riehm, Christiane Eberhardt de This workshop will concern itself specifically with various aspects of warmth in nursing and with practical applications. S45. Understanding of and therapeutic speech in burnout . Dr. med. Albrecht Warning, Franziska Schmidt von Nell de/en Being burnt out, the exhaustion of the flame of life, occurs in the conflict between idealistic keenness and the burden of the pressure of work. A whole range of different weaknesses and states of failure follow. Stressed and worn down in clocked time, our personal life rhythms rigidify or become chaotic. The dynamic of rhythmically shaped speech opens the way to coherence of physical strength, soul vibrancy and spirit contemplation. With speech exercises and reflections on the medical understanding of the human being we aim to offer signposts to self-efficacy. S46. Medical ethics after auschwitz. Prof. Dr. med. Peter Selg de Report on Witten-Herdecke University's medical ethics seminars at the Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial since 2008 and a glimpse of the subject matter reflected on in that location (day 1). Alexander Mitscherlich, the Nuremberg doctors trials and their consequences (day 2). Against \"euthanasia\" . Karl K\u00f6nig's dispute with the paediatrics professor Werner Cate, one of the protago - nists of the euthanasia of children (1939-1945) and future chairholder at Kiel University, Germany (day 3). S47. digital present and future. Dr. Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler de/en What can we do so that children and young people grow up healthily in the world of digital media? How do we ourselves deal with new technology? Is it just about adapting or are there alternatives? What is the transhumanist strategy and message? What does Rudolf Steiner say about the technology of the future? What tasks did he see for anthroposophy and what tasks do we see for the AM movement? S48. Pregnancy - birth - early childhood. Angelika Maaser, Claudia Grah-Wittich de/en How can we organise pregnancy, birth and early childhood in such a way that they can contribute to success, to biography? Letting the introduction (pregnancy), prelude (birth) and overture (early childhood) harmonise together is a chal-lenge today for therapists and physicians. Many children display regulatory and adjustment disorders and require early help. The workshop will focus on the development of a common inner attitude between various disciplines and concrete, networked measures for the start of life to support a healthy development. S49. anthroposophical dentistry then and now. Andrea Theresia Wernthaler, Dr. Wencke Lindemann en/de/eS/Pt By working on topics of dental medicine (periodontitis, bruxism, disorders of enamel formation in children), the workshop aims to set out how as long as a hundred years ago Rudolf Steiner recognised in his lectures for physicians the importance of collaboration between physician and dentists, linking systemic disorders as well as various constitutional types with oral/dental diseases. Hence this workshop is aimed not just at dentists but also physicians who have an interest in how these spiritual scientific connections can be confirmed by modern research.Specialist courses in the 1st half of the week, 16.45-18.0030S50. the veterinary physician, a bridge between the health of animals and humans. Dr. med. vet. Sabrina Menestrina, Dr. med. vet. Claudio Elli de/It It is becoming increasingly clear that the relationship between humans and animals, humans and nature is of fundamental importance for true salutogenesis. It is a question of nutrition, be it the phy - sical feeding of animals or nutrition for the soul through the relationship with domestic animals. Human beings feel a deep need, a hunger for a relationship with animals. How much do we need animals for our wellbeing? All of us speak about the welfare of animals in this century in which animals have lost the dignity of an existence / a life worth living like never before. S51. Stars once spoke to human beings ... - h ow can we approach a mystery medicine understanding? auschel, and Ita Wegman inaugurated and jointly developed an extension of the art of healing. In this context the question about the renewal of the mysteries and of mystery medicine played a crucial role. Studying examples of individual anci-ent mysteries, we intend to investigate, among other things, the question of the relationship between micro- and macrocosm. This interprofessional course will have workshop character. We aim to work interactively on the ques-tions concerning mystery medicine by means including eurythmy, art appreciation and keynote contributions. S52. trauma, resilience and post-traumatic growth. Dr. med. Hartmut G. Horn, Dr. Giovanna Bettini, Psychotherapeutin de/en/It Research shows that the outcome following a traumatic event can vary ranging from the development of post-traumatic stress disorder to complete recovery. What are the resilience factors that allow the soul to heal itself? What kind of trauma therapy interventions on the physical level as well as the etheric, astral and also I level can prevent the development of complications? Through what kind of interventions can we at a later time help the affected person to pick up the thread of their life again? S53. the botany, pharmacy and therapeutic use of mistletoe. Dr. med. Severin P\u00f6chtrager, Dr. sc. nat. Konrad Urech de In this course we will let the nature of mistletoe speak to us on the basis of Goethean and anthroposophical observation. We will learn about the diversity of the various pharmaceutical manufacturing processes and form a basis for the clinical use of mistletoe therapy. S54. Potentised substances - empiricism, theory and Stephan Baumgartner, Dr. med. J\u00fcrg Lehmann de Potentised medicines are an important part of Anthroposophic Medicine. We propose to focus on three subject areas in our workshop: (1) the theoretical and historical background and understanding of potentisation and the effect of potentised medicines from the perspective of Samuel Hahnemann and Rudolf Steiner; (2) the current state of clinical and basic research on the effect and efficacy of potentised preparations; (3) current approaches to an integrative understanding of the potentisation or homoeopathisation process on the basis of the research results of natural and spiritual science. S55. c hemo- and immunotherapies in oncology - spiritual scientific understanding and the - rapeutic support. Dr. med. Marion Debus de/en Against the background of a spiritual scientific understan- ding of cancer, we will examine the development, indications and mode of action of modern cancer treatments. When does it make sense to use them? What is particularly problematical? How does mistletoe therapy work in this context and how is it best deployed? How can side effects be treated? A deeper understanding of conventional therapeutic procedures can become the basis for real integrative therapeutic action for cancer patients.Specialist courses in the 1st half of the week, 16.45-18.0031S57. Support in conspicuous prenatal diagnosis, intrauterine foetal death and when a child dies immediately after birth. Karen Dirks de Conspicuous findings in prenatal diagnosis, the decision whe - ther to carry on with the pregnancy or have an abortion, support when the child has already died in the womb, for stillbirth or when the child dies immediately after birth are situations we repeatedly encounter as specialists. How can we manage to create a space in which parents can make their very individual decisions, can take leave, grieve and accept, realise and process the event? What rituals, texts, pictures, treatments and medicines can help and act as a support? S58. warming up to fever! Prof. Dr. med. David Martin, Dr. med. Henrik Szke, Andrea Szke en/de Based on our examination of all guidelines worldwide and on our FeverApp as well as on our collection of all of Rudolf Steiner's statements on fever, we will investigate and discuss the science of fever and the art of dealing with fever in practice. This will include a closer look at the pros and cons of enemas, calf wraps and washings, as well as a critical look at our medicines. Practical exercises will complement this investigation. S59. the clown and healing. Dr. med. David McGavin, John Browning en The clown perceives what others miss. He notices where the light would shine when all is going dark. He seeks out the paradox, loves absurdity and contradiction. He flourishes in the worlds of uncertainty and mistakes, especially when things are going wrong. If the clown has not got a problem, he's got a big problem. This is a workshop for the modest therapist or clinician who, from time to time, doubts his or her own abilities. S60. the Body as a vessel of memory. Michael Kokinos, Ariane Otto en The emergence of various layers of feelings, qualities and pictures within the client and the therapist while working \"hands on\" in body therapies. How can we distinguish these? How can we integrate them? We will explore this theme working experientially and in conversation through the lens of craniosacral therapy where the cultivation of deep listening and stillness is emphasised. S61. human encounter at the threshold of the new mysteries - the unseen power behind the so-called \"placebo effect\" . Dr. med. James Dyson, Dr. Roberta Nelson, PhD, LPCC, LAC en The boundary between wakeful awareness and the (higher and lower) unconscious is now so very much thinner than a centu- ry ago. Established boundaries between human beings and within personality structures dissolve more readily, frequently bypassing a conscious encounter with the Guardian of the Threshold. Such conditions, nowadays well documented and termed \"spiritual emergencies\" , frequently manifest within the context of both professional and personal relationships.

Short biographies of the workshop leaders and further information can be found at www.crossingbridges.care S89. anthroposophic pastoral medicine - a future impulse. Dr. med. Matthias Girke, Tom\u00e1 Bonk de Anthroposophical pastoral medicine was established by Rudolf Steiner in September 1924. In this workshop we will work on central topics of pastoral medicine and discuss the integration of medical and priestly collabo - ration into the overall treatment of the patient and thus the relationship with the other professional groups. This is connected with the relationship of the sacraments to the medicines and the other therapeutic procedures of Anthroposophic Medicine. As a result the question as to the nature and meaning of the therapeutic community arises as an additional work topic. S90. Infectious diseases, therapeutic concepts and patient information. Madeleen Winkler, Ursi Soldner de/en We will discuss the treatment plans for simple diseases of the upper airways, the chest area and the urinary tract, self-care and therapies, as well as external treatments. These will be shown step-by-step so that they can be understood. S91. therapy at the threshold of the twenty-first century. the morphological changes in the constitution of the child which become visible in the mouth, voice and speech. Enrica Dal Zio, Dr. med. Silvana Santoro, Dr. med. Angela Assenza de/It Changes arising from the observation of the last twenty years in dental medicine, phoniatrics and therapeutic speech. Interdisciplinary therapy and research work in therapeutic speech, dentosophy, phoniatrics and chirophonetics. S92. anxiety in pregnancy today. Dr. Kuck, Mechthild Groh-Schulz de/en The occurrence of an- xiety in pregnancy today; possibilities of therapy from a medical and eurythmy therapy perspective. Eurythmy therapy in pregnancy, in connection with birth and \"becoming parents\" , has shown itself to be very helpful and useful in practice. It creates experiences for expectant mothers which can make attachment with herself and the child easier and strengthen the trust in her own perception.33S93. e urythmy therapy as bridge between cosmic formative forces and the human organism. therapeutic examples from work in oncology. Pirkko Ollilainen, Dr. Sheila Grande de/Pt Depiction of eurythmy therapy in different tumour diseases. Joint work on the movement phenomena of patients and the action of the formative forces in the physiopathology and structure of the therapy. Eurythmy therapy and medical work on oncological clinical pictures relating to the formative forces. Movement pictures as diagnostic phenome - nology of the pathology of the tumour disease. Dealing with the formative forces therapeutically. S94. \"Spirit\" in science and medicine? Prof. Dr. med. Peter Heusser de/en 100 years after the foundation by Rudolf Steiner of a medicine extended by spiritual science, medical disciplines which advocate the spiritual in medicine in theory and practice are once again being vehemently opposed as allegedly being \"unscientific\" . The workshop will therefore deal with questions such as the following: what is spirit? What is the connection between the spirit and medicine? Is a science of the spirit possible? What is its relationship with natural science? Is the accu- sation of being unscientific justified? What is required for the sustainable justification, application, representation and recognition of the spiritual in science and medicine? S95. Building bridges in the sociotherapeutic community. Gabriele F\u00f6rster, Elke Zech, Eric Flem- ming de/en The concrete experience of point and circle. What areas do we touch on when we enter the field of social therapy/special needs education? What does the human being standing at the centre require? What do their surroundings need? How do we manage to build bridges? Using the example of a concrete case report, we want to show the complexity existing between the areas of social therapy/special needs education, medicine, therapies, nursing and art. We want to bring the intangible element that weaves between everything to joint experience through artistic processes and meditation. S96. o wn activity as curative element: meditation and eurythmy therapy. Dr. Katharina Gerlach, M.A., Prof. Dr. med. Friedrich Edelh\u00e4user de Rudolf Steiner encouraged body-oriented meditation from 1904 onwards. Alongside eurythmy therapy instructions, he recommended specific meditations for individual patients between 1921 and 1924. Both - meditating and eurythmy therapy - require the patient's own activity. Through active practice, we will encounter this connection: the individual experience in the intentionally made movement forms the basis for an approach to the question as to what extent a curative effect may be given through the own activity component of eurythmy therapy and meditation. The focus of this workshop will be information about neurological questions. S97. Medicine, meditation, neuroscience. Dr. med. Robert Kempenich en/de How to discover in oneself the functional tripartition and the quadripartite constitution through the stages of imagination, inspiration and intuition. Application in daily medical practice.Specialist courses in the 2nd half of the week, 16.45-18.0034S98. Spiritual organology. Dr. med. Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler, Rolf Heine, Philine Wetzel de/en The godlikeness of the human body turns this body into the temple of the deity. Every detail of form, be it ever so small, every function, particularly the structure and action of the inner organs, bears witness to that. The aim of this workshop is to recognise their spiritual signature, to make it productive for diagnosis and therapy. Literature: Rudolf Steiner, GA 10: Knowledge of the Higher Worlds and Its Attainment; Course for Young Doctors, lectures 7 and 8; Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler: Raphael and the Mysteries of Illness and Healing. S100. anthroposophical treatment plans for dermatological diseases. Dr. med. L\u00fcder Jachens de To begin with, neurodermatitis and psoriasis will be looked at as a polarity. Then we will discuss the treatment of dermatoses via the inner organs, particularly the liver, using the example of acne and rosacea. Lastly we will deal with the personality and the treatment of patients with a malignant melanoma. S101. the other way round - support and care for people with dementia. Ursa Neuhaus, lic. phil., Rachel Maeder-Lis de Supporting and caring for people with dementia is a temporal and spatial challenge. The course of developing dementia can take up to twelve years and care measures keep increasing towards the end of life. The focus is on three central questions: how does a person with dementia experience the world in everyday life and in particular situations? How can the progression of the disease be recognised, consciously supported and shared together? What attitude is necessary in the encounter with people with developing dementia? S102. the healthy social life is found ... - what elements and paths can we find for a renewed mys - and Ita Wegman inaugurated and jointly developed an extension of the art of healing. In this context the question about the renewal of the mysteries and of mystery medicine played a crucial role. Looking at examples of individual mysteries, we intend to investigate the question: how can we come closer to a renewed mystery medicine? Which elements can play a central role in it? This interprofessional course will have workshop character. We aim to work interactively on the questions concerning mystery medicine by means of eurythmy, art appreciation and keynote contributions, among other things. S103. Pain treatment in anthroposophic body therapy. Elma Pressel, Stephan Thilo de/en Pain with varying causes and in various forms presents a challenge to any therapeutic intervention. In everyday therapy we frequently encounter treatment resistant pain symptoms which respond well to body-oriented interventions and can frequently be led into a healing process. In this workshop we want to touch on the experiences, courses of action and possibilities of body therapeutic interventions in discussion among colleagues and work on practice-relevant treatment approaches based on the study of the human constitutional elements. S104. c oncepts of HP four different levels of the patient's being: their corporeality, their life sphere integrated into the social environment, their soul world, and their spiritual ties. The palliative patient can experience pain at these four levels up to and including existential distress with the longing for death (total pain concept of Cicely Saunders). Using practical examples, we will present and jointly continue to develop concepts of anthroposophically extended palliative care including external treatments, art therapy, eurythmy therapy and a spiritually-based encounter through conversation.Specialist courses in the 2nd half of the week, 16.45-18.0035S105. Induction of labour - anthroposophically supported. Merja Riij\u00e4rvi, Anette Beisswenger de/ Se is Relevant medical indications; midwife's anamnesis based on the anthroposophical understanding of the human being; choice of methods and resources from anthroposophical nursing, art therapy and medicine; carrying out and testing their efficacy can lead to a reorientation. This offers the woman and child re-entry to the individual birth process and counters the pathologies with corresponding interventions. Midwives, gynaecologists and paediatricians are invited who want to partake in the wealth of experience of the art of anth- roposophical nursing and midwifery. S106. f rom an infirmary to a house of health. Lukas Hirt, Helene von Bremen, Philipp Busche de This workshop aims to work on the question what is needed to turn a hospital under present conditions into a place in which health can be cultivated and developed and in which this applies to patients and staff alike? To this end we will work on current social questions using existing examples and we look forward to the ideas and experiences of participants. The workshop is planned to be creative workshop and is intended to become a crystallisation point for new projects. S107. anthroposophic treatment concepts for arterial hypertension. Dr. med. Thomas Breitkreuz en The workshop aims to deepen the understanding of hypertension as the no.1 chronic cardiovascular disease and to deliver basic knowledge for practising the anthroposophic three type approach. Rudolf Steiner's approach to cardiovascular diseases will be discussed in the context of recent research in conventional and integrative cardiology. The three types concept will be introduced in a practical manner in order to enable and encourage participants to diagnose, advise and treat their patients (focus on anthroposophic medicines and external applications). The target groups is physicians / students. Nurses and therapists are welcome. S108. the patient in the field of tension between hospital and house or home - do I bear the responsibility alone? Elke Kaschdailewitsch, Dorothea von Heynitz de Finally alone! Loneliness despite to - getherness? Where do I feel my loneliness as painful? What is required to counter loneliness? Welcome loneliness!S109. Supported with love - approaching end of life. Barbara Trapp, Mechtild Bischof de When people turn towards the end of life, it widens the perspective to questions about existence here and on the other side, both for the people who are terminally ill and also for those of us who support them. Opening the heart can prepare a supportive field which helps to overcome anxieties, find a profound encounter with oneself and one's destiny, resolve conflicts and, as appropriate, experience peace. Through keynote presentations, artistic exercises, meditation, spiritual healing work, exchange of experiences and eurythmy it can become possible to obtain effec-tive supporting experiences and to approach this soul-spiritual space. S110. Show your wound - integrative wound care in the c hristophorus community hospice. Christine Kolbe-Alberdi, Birgit Kuban de Since 2017, the nurses in the community hospice have carried out integrative wound care. The healthful combination of complementary and conventional methods will be presented using case descriptions. Serious wounds caused, for example, by ulcerating tumours represent a great additional burden for the patient concerned. This, at the latest, \"reveals\" the serious terminal illness. If a wound improves un- der committed wound care, this reveals the patient's life forces and also forces of hope. The healing wound become an outer expression of healing.Specialist courses in the 2nd half of the week, 16.45-18.0036S111. depression, one of the great epidemics of our time. Dr. med. Joost Laceulle, Dr. med. Marieke Krans, Hilda Boersma en Depression. How we can distinguish the various forms, including with the help of organ typologies, and how we can treat them anthroposophically in our therapeutic centres and other health centres. Medicinal therapy will be discussed and eurythmy therapy practised. Many other therapeutic possibilities, artistic, pastoral, etc., as well as the therapeutic conversation will also be raised. S113. the human upright as a bridge to wholeness and health. Jaimen McMillan, Elja Thilo en/ de In this workshop we will concern ourselves with the power of human uprightness from the perspective of Bothmer\u00a9 gymnastics and Spacial Dynamics\u00a9: what enables it at a physical, soul and spiritual level? Why do we always have to struggle for it? What ideas and exercises for our patients and ourselves can we take away with us? We will tackle these questions in discussion and movement.Specialist courses in the 2nd half of the week, 16.45-18.0037evening contributions on spirituality and inner development 20.00-21.00 In the evening, our work on consciousness turns inwards with the goal of enabling a connection between the conference content and our personal, professional or universally human path of training and development. It is intended to provide a counterpoint to the more externally oriented contributions throughout the day. Three possibilities in large groups are offered and once one has been chosen participants should stay with it since the content is conceived as a thematic arc which builds internally on what has gone before. The groups can be chosen at the conference. 1.

VOLODE66 Reason for payment JK 2020\"39content Preparation for the world c onference \u00bbcrossing Bridges - Being human!\u00ab While the world is holding its breath globally, worried about infecting each other, it may be helpful to seek a deeper form of inspiration. We are concerned with the phenomenon of microbial infection and the danger posed by the omnipresent coronavirus - an information carrier whose message will occupy the world for some time to come. We are asking ourselves: would it be possible to infect each other in a good sense, through words, through the right ideas, through empowering ideals, from which the future of a therapeutic community in a healthy healthcare system can arise? 100 years ago Rudolf Steiner gave three seminal lectures on the inner development of Anthroposophic Medicine. At their center is the mystery of warmth - which forms a bridge between the four elements and the four ethers. Warmth ignites the possibility of contagious enthusiasm for an ideal, allowing light-filled orientation and strength to penetrate our lives. While abstract thoughts and theories paralyze our existence, our task today is rather one for the heart: how can I penetrate myself with an ideal in such a way that it becomes a health-giving seed of life that reaches into my body and my surroundings? In these lectures known as the \"bridge lectures\" we find the three royal ideals of freedom, love and wisdom, which are traced back to their original principles. Freedom seems to be drastically threatened in all areas today. Loving touch and interpersonal encounters are limited by demands for deliberate isolation. It is especially in the loneliness of each individual that the inner search for the origin of these three ideals of humanity may become a source of strength. Where can I inwardly explore to discover and develop the sources of my inner freedom and capacity for love? And how can I approach the ideal of wisdom in a time of diverse and sometimes even contradictory information? Crossing Bridges - Being Human! is the title of our world conference to mark the 100th anniversary of Anthroposophic Medicine. We want to build bridges. Bridges from a purely scientific world view to a spiritual art of healing with the human being at its center. We would like to encourage you to look at the current world crisis against the background of building bridges between natural science and the moral-spiritual dimension and thus prepare the content of our conference together. Michaelic endeavor to gain knowledge and courage is just as necessary for this as Raphaelic exchange about concrete remedies, therapies, or moments of reflection on the actual task that is currently facing humanity. We would be glad if you would like to work with the bridge lectures against the background of the current world situation, either alone or in small working groups, in writing or in video conferences. You can find quotes and ideas here at the webside. A completely new edition of the bridge lectures has recently been published in German and English by the Ita Wegman Institute and can be ordered from book@crossing-bridges.care. We also welcome your concrete questions or thoughts, which can be shared with us at info@crossing-bridges.careBooking Form Crossing Bridges - Being Human! 100 Years of Anthroposophical Medicine Conference of the Medical Section at the Goetheanum from Saturday, 12 to Sunday, 20 September 2020 Registration closes: Saturday, 29 August 2020 Please complete the booking form and mail, fax or email to: Goetheanum Empfang, Postfach, CH-4143 DornachFax 4444 email tickets@goetheanum.org 3OHDVH\u0003\u00c0OO\u0003RXW\u0003LQ\u0003EORFN\u0003FDSLWDOV\u0004F Ms F Mr 1DPH\u000f\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003QDPH\u0003 BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB Billing address F private address F address of translation into F German F English F French F Spanish F Italian F\u0003Russian F\u0003Japanese F\u0003Chinese (DUO\\\u0003ERRNLQJ\u0003SULFH\u0003XQWLO\u0003\u0016\u0013\u0011\u0013\u0019\u0011\u0015\u0013\u0015\u0013\u000f\u0003FRQIHUHQFH\u0003WLFNHW\u0003LQFOXGLQJ\u0003DOO\u0003OXQFKHV\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003FRQIHUHQFHF CHF 770 regular CHF 290 students\u00b2 F CHF 1200 with sponsorship\u00b3 /DWH\u0003ERRNLQJ\u0003SULFH\u0003IURP\u0003\u0014\u0011\u0013\u001a\u0011\u0015\u0013\u0015\u0013\u000f\u0003FRQIHUHQFH\u0003WLFNHW\u0003LQFOXGLQJ\u0003DOO\u0003OXQFKHV\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003FRQIHUHQFH F CHF 840 regular price F CHF 660 with concessions\u00b9 F CHF 350 students\u00b2 F CHF 1200 with sponsorship\u00b3 F CHF 200 Breakfast (8x) F CHF 120\u00a7 Food intolerance F Gluten F Lactose Parking at Tour (please send me more information about this) F Parts of the anniversary conference where there is room for personal input (please send me more information about this) F Insurance F Cancellation insurance (5% of the total costs, CHF 10 minimum) See cancellation conditions in the General Information Payment methods F on invoice (only Switzerland and Euro zone)Credit card (all countries) F Visa F MasterCard &DUG\u0003QXPEHU \u0003BB\u0003BB\u0003BB\u0003BB\u0003\u0012\u0003BB\u0003BB\u0003BB\u0003BB\u0003\u0012\u0003BB\u0003BB\u0003BB\u0003BB\u0003\u0012\u0003BB\u0003BB\u0003BB\u0003BB\u0003\u0003 ([SLU\\\u0003GDWH \u0003BB\u0003BB\u0003\u0012\u0003BB\u0003BB I agree to the terms of payment and cancellation.
