Our naturopathic doctor, Dr. Nicole Schertell, ND, employs the following therapies and philosophies in her practice: Although licensed naturopathic doctors receive medical training similar to other types of doctors, it is the following list of philosophies that set them apart in their practice: Underlying causes of illness and disease must be identified and removed before healing can occur. Physical exams and [laboratory tests](/advanced-lab-testing.html) assist the naturopathic doctor with this process. Symptoms are viewed as an expression of the body's attempt to defend or heal itself. A symptom also means that the body is speaking - \"something is wrong here.\" Naturopaths treat the cause of disease to alleviate symptoms, rather than merely trying to suppress the symptom. Have you ever paid attention to how your skin heals itself when you get a small cut or burn? Or did you know that your body creates a fever for a very intelligent purpose - to kill bacteria or viruses that have invaded your system? Each person possesses an innate ability to heal; a force of nature within that strives to keep you in good health. The naturopathic physician's role is to facilitate this process by identifying and removing any obstacles in the way of recovery, and by supporting the body's own abilities to heal. Naturopathic physicians use natural substances and medicines that minimize the risk of harmful side effects. In addition, they begin by using the smallest dose necessary to restore health. Naturopathic physician's respect and work with the innate healing capabilities of each person, for it is when this self-healing process is not respected that the patient may be harmed. The original meaning of the word \"doctor\" is teacher. A principal objective of naturopathic medicine is to empower the patient through education & with an emphasis on self-responsibility for health. Naturopathic physicians acknowledge the therapeutic benefits of having a doctor-patient relationship that is based on mutual respect and responsibility. Health and disease result from a complex of physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social and other factors. Naturopathic doctors provide a comprehensive and individualized approach to diagnosis and treatment, taking all of the above factors into account. Treatment plans address the whole person, and are used to restore health and prevent disease. Naturopathic doctors are preventative medicine specialists & believe that prevention is the best medicine. Naturopaths have LOTS to offer to prevent the onset & progression of disease, even when patients have been told that there is nothing they can do! Naturopathic physicians assess risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease, and make appropriate interventions, in partnership with their patients, to prevent illness.
