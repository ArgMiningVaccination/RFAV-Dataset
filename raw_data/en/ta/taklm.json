Having a pocket of green in which you can spend your time soaking up the sun and getting fresh air can have positive benefits for your mental health. You can even plant your own fruit, veggies, and herbs to supplement your grocery shopping. It takes a lot of work to make a garden thrive - and to keep it thriving - and while the [work can be healing](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/how-gardening-affects-mental-health), it can be frustrating when trying to rid your garden of the pests that insist on blighting your corner of the outdoors. Garden pests can refer to insects, weeds, fungi, bacteria, and viruses, as well as mice, moles, pigeons, and rabbits. Gardeners' go-to solution for pests - especially the smaller, at times almost-invisible critters - is often to reach for a bottle of pesticide. Let's explore the safety and sustainability of pesticides along with look at some natural and organic pesticides. What Are Pesticides? The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines a pesticide as any chemical used to [ prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate pest](https://www.epa.gov/expobox/exposure-assessment-tools-chemical-classes-pesticides). You get different types of pesticides, according to their function. These are usually evident in their names e.g. insecticides for insects, herbicides for weeds, fungicides for fungi, and so on. What Makes Pesticides Toxic? And What Ingredients Should We Avoid in Gardens? Conventional pesticides contain chemical ingredients which can be toxic. We are exposed to these through inhalation, ingestion, and absorption through our skin and eyes. Pyrethroids, for example, are organic compounds found in pesticides that are [neurotoxic to insects and mammals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/pyrethroid), potentially affecting their central nervous system when ingested in large doses. They have been linked to [ autism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001393512031392X) and [Parkinson's disease,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5398229/) and can also be [toxic to aquatic life](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1382668915301010). One you may have heard of is glyphosate, because its name is sometimes used interchangeably with Roundup. However, they are not the same thing. Glyphosate is a chemical compound. It is the active ingredient in the product Roundup, a herbicide commonly used in both gardens and on farms. Its risk to human health is a divided topic, with [ some studies finding links to cancer and others not](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/herbicide-glyphosate-cancer). However, while its link to cancer may be tenuous it can lead to skin and eye irritation. Other ingredients to avoid on a garden pesticide product label include: 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) 1,3-Dichloropropene Atrazine Methomyl Metaldehydes Exposure to these chemicals happens in large agricultural operations as workers apply pesticides to fields and crops, continually exposing themselves, surrounding communities, the environment, and our food to toxic chemicals. The environment is impacted as chemicals leach into the soil, contaminating groundwater, as well as being released into the air and running off into waterways. This can impact aquatic ecosystems, affecting plant and animal life. Human health risks due to exposure or contact can include eye and skin irritation, as well as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Longer-lasting effects may include cancer. This exposure and its potential effects happen in your garden as well. Children are particularly vulnerable because they love exploring, putting things in their mouths, and even eating dirt (remember making mud pies?). This curiosity applies to pets too. Exacerbating the problem is the irony that the more pesticides are used, [ the more they are needed](https://www.planetnatural.com/garden-chemicals/) because pests can develop resistance to pesticides and pass this on to their offspring. Common Pests Found in Gardens One of the most common problem critters preying on your plants are aphids. They such the sap out of stems and leaves, and [encourage and spread diseases. ](https://gardening.org/10-most-common-garden-pests-and-how-to-fight-them/) [Spider mites ](https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/spider-mites/)are also common. And don't be fooled by names: cabbage maggots also love broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower; the Colorado potato beetles are not exclusive to that state and also love tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. Cutworms, however, live up to their name, cutting through the stems of young plants. That's not all: there are also mites, thrips, mealybugs, and harmful beetles like flea beetles, Japanese beetles, Mexican bean beetles, and of course caterpillars, slugs, and snails. Remember that not all insects are harmful. In fact, there are some beneficial insects that are good for your garden and some that are harmless. A sterile garden is not a healthy garden. Whether using pesticides or safer alternatives, your aim is not to obliterate all life. Instead, focus on eliminating the really bad pests and increasing the good guys. 7 Non-Toxic Pesticide Ideas for Your Home Garden With all the environmental and health impacts with most people don't want to use commercial pesticides in their home garden...especially if it's a vegetable garden or something you're planning to eat. Let's look at some of the safest pesticides some of which you can even make at home. Introduce and Support Good Insects Fight fire with fire...or bug with bug, in this case. Create a thriving habitat not only for your plants but for all the bugs that are actually good for your garden. These include ladybugs and lacewings. They feed on aphids, mealybugs, and thrips. Dragonflies prey on flies, gnats, and mosquitoes, and braconid wasps prey on hornworms, aphids, and tent caterpillars. There are also assassin bugs that are true to their name by targeting flies, mosquitoes, and caterpillars. Pollinators like bees and butterflies are also important because they aid in pollination which is key to a healthy garden. Pollination results in the production of plants which in turn results in habitat as well as food for animals (including humans!). [Pollinators help more than 80% of the world's flowering plants reproduce](https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/pollinators/), so you want these in your garden. How do you attract them? By planting plants the beneficial organisms love (and the bad guys hate). Plant More Plants Some plants, and even weeds, act as natural pest repellents. One of the most well-known is marigolds, especially French marigolds. They help keep away pests like aphids and attract ladybugs. One of marigolds' most powerful effects is that they produce toxins that kill harmful nematodes that feed on plant roots. Herbs like basil and chive can also repel pests and give you extra pickings for your kitchen. If you want a pretty repellent, lavender and sunflowers will do the trick. Lavender repels fleas, flies, mosquitoes, and moths, and attracts bees. Sunflowers attract aphids and ants drawing them away from plants that are not as capable at handling these armies of pests. Weeds like dandelions and stinging nettles should not be dismissed, as they also attract good bugs and repel bad ones. Make a Homemade Spray A DIY spray made using ingredients from your kitchen can be a cheaper, safer alternative to pesticides. Mixing vegetable oil, castile soap, and water can create a a spray that is deadly for pests, but safe for humans and pets. You can even just leave out the oil and create a simple soap spray. Once ready, put in a spray bottle and spray the mixture on the surface of plants. This will coat and suffocate pests like aphids, mites, and beetles. Another concoction you can try is mixing castile soap, water, and garlic or chili which can also act as a repellent. The scent of a chili or [garlic spray](https://homeguides.sfgate.com/garlic-spray-garden-pests-22908.html) is [strong and repels](https://www.happysprout.com/gardening/garlic-pesticide/). Make sure you wear gloves and wash your hands thoroughly afterward, especially when working with hot peppers. Neem Oil Spray Another effective alternative is creating a [neem oil spray](https://www.bhg.com/gardening/pests/neem-oil-for-plants/). It fights hundreds of pests and prevents or kills certain fungi. Neem oil is also organic and safe for beneficial bugs like ladybugs, bees, and butterflies. Repurpose Kitchen Waste Keeping kitchen waste out of the trash is [ good for the environment.](https://www.colorado.edu/ecenter/2022/02/16/reducing-food-waste-kitchen) There are many ways to reduce waste in your kitchen and one of those is using it to repel pests. Coffee grounds [repel mosquitos, fruit flies, and beetles](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/uses-for-coffee-grounds#TOC_TITLE_HDR_4), and create a barrier that will discourage slugs and snails from crossing over and munching on your plants. Coffee grounds also double up as a fertilizer since they contain minerals that are good for growth. You can also crush eggshells and spread them on soil, repelling slugs, snails, and cutworms who are cut from crawling over the shells, then dehydrate and die. Diatomaceous earth works in a similar fashion. These are perfect solutions for any organic gardener Buy Diatomaceous Earth While not exactly DIY you can buy diatomaceous earth yourself at most garden centers - and unlike the usual pesticides you'd purchase, it's non-toxic. Sometimes the bags can be quite big, so consider splitting with a neighbor. Made from fossilized water plants, diatomaceous earth dries out and kills pests like snails, slugs, and other crawling beasties by absorbing oils and fats from the cuticle of their exoskeleton. Apply it to your garden by sprinkling it on the ground around plants or even on their foliage. Essential Oils Depending on the pest you're trying to get rid of select essential oils or apple cider vinegar might also be beneficial. To protect your outdoor plants you can create an [essential oil spray with hot or distilled water ](https://tasty-yummies.com/homemade-essential-oil-insect-repellent-spray/)or put oils directly in the garden.
