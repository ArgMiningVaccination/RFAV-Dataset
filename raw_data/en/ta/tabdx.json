REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ACTIVITIES Report of the Office of Health Insurance Programs A ctivities Mr. Helgerson presented his report from Albany. H e began his report by updating the members on the status of the New York DSRIP program and the delivery system reform incentive payment program. DSRIP it a very importa nt initiative with a $7.3 billion investment that is. DSRIP is now in the fourth quarter of the first year of the demonstration. The current 2 status of the initiative is there are 25 performing provider systems all across the state. Their applications that they submitted they committed to implement somewhere between eight and eleven projects, and those projects each every one of them requires them to build relationships, build infrastructure, deploy new technologies to en sure that those projects are implemented within the timeframes that they committed to in the ir applications. This initiative covers about 90,000 providers are involved in DSRIP. The 25 PPS 's covers all parts of the state. The PPS's report to the Department and the Department reports to the public and CMS on a quarterly basis the progress of each and every one of the 25 PPSs. The quarterly reports are available on the Department's website. Mr. Helgerson explained there are two payments that are made under the initiative. This initiative is paid for performance, in the sense th e PPSs have to demonstrate that their implementing their infrastructure and that eventual ly that they are improving the outcomes of the Medicaid patients that they serve and then when the y are able to demonstrate that they will receive payment. There have been two payments made to the initiative so far. The first payment was linked to their successful completion of an app lication, but the second payment which was made just in January was linked to information date d that was contained in their second quarter of the demonstration year one report which was anal yzed by a contractor for the State, the independent assessor and when the independent asses sor reviewed those reports they deemed that PPSs qualified for more than 98 percent of the total payment for which they would be eligible for that particular payment. Mr. Helgerson also highlighted the terms and condit ions of that waiver. There is an oversight review panel that has been convened and t hey play a role in approving the applications submitted by the performing provider systems. He a lso indicated there are 25 PPSs in two cohorts. One cohort was an upstate cohort, the oth er cohort was the downstate PPSs, each of PPSs were given time to present and speak about the ir progress. The oversight review panel then was able to ask the PPS's questions during the two day session. Mr. Helgerson spoke on the topic of value-based payment for New York Medicaid. CMS felt very strongly that in order to sustain the infrastructure that they were investing in DSRIP that we would have to fundamentally change how Medicaid purchase services and much more focused purchasing services based on the value that they provide to the community, to th e patients, as opposed to the volume of services that they provide. There was a value-base d payment roadmap which was approved by CMS last summer, and 16 workgroups that included 45 0 stakeholders from all across the state which included various groups such as clinical expe rts in a variety of different fields, insurance executives, patient advocates, public health expert s, local government representatives who came together to address how to implement value-based pa yment in a successful fashion. An updated version of the roadmap will be about 90 pages and p laced onto the website for broader public comment. There will then be efforts to implement t he roadmap which mostly requires contractual changes in the contracts that the state has with the Medicaid managed care plans. value-based payment. Mr. Helgerson concluded his report. To see the mem bers comments and questions, please see pages 2 through 16 of the attached trans cript. 3 REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ACTIVITIES Mr. Kraut moved to the next item on the agenda, th e Report of Department of Health Activities and turned the meeting over to Dr. Zucke r. Zika Dr. Zucker began his report by updating the members on the Zika outbreaks South and Central America which was also declared a public he alth emergency of international concern by the World's Health Organization. Most cases are th e result of mosquito bites and that Zika has become rampant in South and Central America as well as the Caribbean and Mexico. Zika is transmitted primarily by the Aedes Aegypti mosquito and 80 percent of patients who have Zika do not have symptoms. Zika has been linked to micr ocephaly, a birth defect that can cause brain damage and small heads and there is also the possib ility of some relationship with Guyon barre syndrome which is a paralysis, usually a temporary paralysis. The CDC and Department of Health are urging pregnant women to postpone travel plans to the affected countries, pregnant women who have traveled to the regions should be te sted for the Zika virus regardless of whether they have symptoms or not. Another complication is that we now have emerging evidence that Zika may be sexually transmitted. In Dallas Texas there is a patient who is found to have Zika after having intimate contact with someone who was already infected with the virus. Dr. Zucker explained that in New York we have 16 pe ople who have been infected. The cold weather is giving New York some protection, bu t some regions of the state do have the aedes albopictus species of the mosquito but it may not be as effective as it is transmitting as the aedes aegypti type of mosquito. New York is keepin g a close watch on Zika and will be increasing mosquito surveillance. Hospitals and pr oviders must report suspected cases of Zika and all other arboviral diseases to the local healt h department where the patient resides. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria for testing can g o to any of the number of healthcare facilities across the state and they will have specimens colle cted and they will be shipped to the Department's Wadsworth Lab up in Albany for testing . Wadsworth Center is currently one of the very few labs in the country that can do the Zi ka test, and the Department will be reporting lab confirmed cases to the Centers for Disease Cont rol and prevention. The Department will continue to keep everyone informed as developed, an d so as Zika unfolds. Governor's Budget and State of the State Address Dr. Zucker announced that the Governor presented th e State of the State Address on January 13 th and released the Executive Budget for 2016-2017 as part of his address. The Governor announced a comprehensive renewed focus on fighting breast cancer. Besides skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cause of c ancer in women in New York and we have about 15,000 diagnoses each year. It is also the s econd largest cause of cancer related death in New York for women responsible for about 2,700 deat hs per year. The Governor wants to change that and his new initiatives encourage women to get mammograms. The State will fund community-based peer education programs in the high needs areas throughout the State. It will include funds for a media campaign to raise awarene ss about the importance of breast cancer screening. The Department will make it more conven ient for women in New York to get a 4 mammogram. Many women are not getting screened for breast cancer because they just cannot get to their appointments and the Department is loo king into locations and hours to determine if they may be inconvenient. The Department will awar d mobile mammography vans to hospitals in areas with a high number of unscreened women. I n addition the Department will enable cancer treatment facilities to higher workers speci fically trained to reach out to women due to screening, and these workers will provide patients with a one on one attention that they need. The Department is going to challenge private compan ies to give women four hours of paid leave for mammograms so that women can get screened witho ut worrying about lost wages. With these strategies in place we expect more than 212,0 00 women in the state will be screened by December 2020. The Governor's plans will no doubt save thousands of lives and the Department looks forward to moving forward with the agenda. Medical Marijuana Program Next, Dr. Zucker spoke on the topic of the medical marijuana program. The program officially launched on January 7th. All five regis tered organizations now have dispensing facilities. There are 378 physicians who have take n the online practitioners course and they are now registered to certify patients for the use of m edical marijuana. There are 805 patients who have already been certified. The program will prov ide medical marijuana to patients suffering from 10 difficult diseases. New diseases may be ad ded later and Dr. Zucker noted that he is looking at the data as it comes out. Health Exchange Marketplace Dr. Zucker advised that the Health Exchange Marketp lace concluded its enrollment period on January 31st. To date, New York has more than 2.7 million people enrolled in the health insurance through the exchange which include s about 1.9 million in Medicaid. It also includes about 350,000 in the new Essential Plan wh ich is a new and more affordable option for low income New Yorkers. The enrollees in the Essen tial Plan pay no fees for routine visits and recommended screenings that keep them healthy. The Essential Plan covers inpatient and outpatient care, physician services, diagnostic ser vices, prescription drugs, with no annual deductible and low out of pocket cost. The monthly premium ranges anywhere from zero to $20 a month. The Essential Plan is partially paid by f ederal funds. Consumers who did not enroll in a qualified healthplan are unable to do so this yea r unless they have a qualifying life event and that would include everything from marriage, a loss of an employer coverage, or under new law this year, pregnancy. Enrollment in Medicaid, Chil d Health Plus, and the Essential Plan is all open all year round. Flu Dr. Zucker noted that he had just declared flu as p revalent. There have been about 600 flu related hospitalizations reported and no report ed deaths, pediatric deaths from flu. Over the last three seasons there have been 26 pediatric flu deaths in New York and on average about 9,966 flu related hospitalizations each season. Th e declaration of a prevalent flu season means that healthcare workers must be vaccinated or wear a surgical mask to prevent transmission of flu to patients. 86 percent of healthcare personne l in surveyed facilities were vaccinated in the 2014-2015 flu seasons, which is up one percent from the previous year. 5 New York State Health Equity Report Dr. Zucker announced the publication of a 2016 coun ty addition of the New York State Health Equity report. The report was compiled by t he Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities Prevention, the Office of Public Health , the Office of Public Health Practice, and the New York State Minority Health Council. It examine s 47 health indicators by race and ethnicity including birth outcomes, prenatal care usage, and rate of hospitalizations as well as measures on demographic status. In addition to serving as a to ol to raise awareness about the health of racial and ethnic populations, the report helps to strengt hen the efforts of our prevention agenda, the DSRIP program, State Health Innovation Plan. All th ese initiatives aim to reduce or eliminate racial, ethnic, or socio-economic health disparitie s. Despite our best efforts, ethnic and racial healthcare disparities exist and the key to reducin g them is by making critical data available to help communities focus attention on those areas and to put the appropriate interventions in place. Dr. Zucker noted that the good news is New York is getting closer to becoming the healthiest state in the nation. Last December the America's H ealth rankings released the 2014 Data and it ranked New York as the 13 th healthiest state and that was an improvement from the year prior to that one with the 14 th healthiest which is a marked improvement over the course of the last 10 years when we were at the 27 th . Dr. Zucker concluded his report. Mr. Kraut thanked Dr. Zucker and took questions from the members.

REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ACTIVITIES Report of the Office of Primary Care and Health Sys tems Management Activities Next, Mr. Kraut introduced Mr. Sheppard to give hi s report on the Activities of the Office of Primary Care and Health Systems Management. Mr. Sheppard began his report by updating the membe rs on ambulatory surgery center data. The members were provided 2 spreadsheets con taining a summary of data for 47 ambulatory surgery centers that are under limited l ife; 41 that are in the midst of their original life, and six under extended. The data is in terms of the charity care and Medicaid participation against the approved targets is from the institutio nal cost reports they submitted as well as SPARCS. There is another data source that we shoul d have are the independent reports, the third party reports that are contingency of their approva l. The compliance rates with the third party reporting is quite low, and the Department is sendi ng out delinquent notices requiring that they provide those reports within the next several month s and the Department is assessing now just setting up a fixed date for that, and will be issui ng statements of deficiencies if they are non- compliance with those report filing notices. Mr. Sheppard summarized the data explaining there are four ambulatory surgery centers with operating certificates expiring in 2016 and tw o of four of those are meeting targets on a combined charity care and Medicaid basis. Eight ha ve operating certificates expiring next calendar year in 2017 and four of eight of those ar e currently meeting targets. Eleven have operating certificates expiring in 2018 and six of those eleven are meeting their targets on a combined basis. Moving forward, the Department is going to report back to the Council in six months with both in terms of compliance with the in dependent reporting requirement as well as where they are with the targets and then subsequent to that the Department will incorporate this type of update as part of the annual basis. Mr. Sheppard concluded his report. Mr. Kraut than ked Mr. Sheppard and inquired if members had questions or comments. To see the comp lete report and comments from members, please see pages 34 through 62 of the attached tran script. 7 Report of the Office of Public Health Activities Mr. Kraut introduced Ms. Pirani who was participat ing from Albany to give an update on the activities of the Office of Public Health. Ms. Pirani began her report by presenting a power point presentation. She described the monitoring of the Prevention Agenda Implementation, progress at the community level. The Department has a couple of new tools on the Departm ent's website. The local health departments and hospitals are working hard on their prevention agenda efforts. In December they reported to the Department on what they were w orking on and interventions being implemented especially in the prevention of chronic disease priority where just about every institution is working on. They are also working h ard to promote mental health care and promote substance abuse services a priority. Ms. P irani described the website where you can click on any county and learn more about what is go ing on in, by the county health departments, by the hospitals that are reporting in those counti es. Ms. Pirani explained the health equity report whic h will be another important tool as those assessments are being conducted, also for any number of activities including for the PPSs to focus their attention. This is the Department's new source of data to assess disparity. The report has 47 health related indicators with data f rom 2011 to 2013 from multiple sources. Highlighted are socio-demographic indicators, healt h indicators, birth-related indicators, etc. The data are displayed by State, by region and by c ounty. The executive summary highlights strengths and challenges for each subpopulation gro up and comparison between data from this report and the previous report which was issued in 2010. The report was worked on by the Center for Health Equity. Ms. Pirani described each slide from the power poi nt. She described the last slide containing next steps and how it relates to the Pre vention Agenda. The Department is continuing our communication and providing technical assistanc e on the Prevention Agenda, issues and challenges. Ms. Pirani concluded her report. Several members had questions and comments. Please see pages 62 through 73 of the attached transcript. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES Report of the Activities of the Committee on Public Health Mr. Kraut introduced Dr. Boufford to give her Repor t of the Committee on Public Health. Dr. Boufford presented for adoption the Report on P revention of Maternal Mortality in New York State. Maternal mortality, the numbers ar e quite small in absolute numbers and one of the things that came up in the Committee was the y would like to see the absolute numbers in this report. There are very few as a consequence t here are very few entities that take this on as an issue relative to the pressures they face for ot her issues which is why the Committee felt it is important to do it as a statewide effort, and that has been the focus of our work. This was the issue that the Public Health Committee agreed to wo rk on as the move the needle one, and we 8 have had really great cooperation from the State He alth Department. Dr. Boufford complemented the Division of Family Health, Rachel DeLong and her team, Marilyn Casica, and Sylvia Pirani. Dr. Boufford noted that New York is 47 th out of 50 states. This is not a good ranking on maternal mortality. The racial disparities are sor t of 5.7 to 7 to one citywide on clack to white and statewide around three-ish to one. So there is significant racial disparities in this area. In t he review done by the Department we identified there i s a considerable amount of work that has been done by HANYS, by Greater New York, New York S tate ACOG and by the State on inpatient crisis management around issues like hemo rrhage, deep vein thrombosis and hypertension. However, relatively little attention to the prehospital opportunities to address, identify high risk women, make sure they are gettin g to care early on in their pregnancy, and also to be sure that women of reproductive age have the opportunity to decide whether or not they wish to get pregnant, and if they are in a risk cat egory because of preexisting diabetes, hypertension which increasingly sadly is the case f or younger and younger women, that they know what their risk factors might be. The Committ ee decided to focus on the prehospital and the key issue for is that about 40+ percent of all pregnancies in New York State are unplanned and so the goal, this is a major risk factor, if yo u look at the literature for maternal mortality and so the idea is to bring to women the opportunity to get timely real time if you will contraceptive intervention if they wish, and we heard some very i nteresting conversations. Dr. Boufford stated that one of the questions that came up if we are looking at prehospital is what is going on in the state relative to what w e consider the really comprehensive primary care practices, what are they doing, and then how m ight this issue of reproductive health of women and reducing risk fit into state reform initi atives? There were a series of discussions about that as a Committee, and the key clinical pra ctice issue in primary care is what they call the one big question, whenever a woman of reproduct ive age touches a healthcare facility is to ask them do they plan to get pregnant in the next y ear. It is also showing up in the national literature increasingly as a very important interve ntion to reduce unplanned pregnancy. The Committee also had terrific cooperation from the Of fice of Quality and Patient Safety and the State Health Innovation Plan, and also looking at h ealth homes. Very few DSRIP and PPSs actually put this on their list, which again is primary because of the small numbers. But they were very helpful, and I think the learnings here is that there is all of these entities consider the issue of reprodu ctive health on their list, but at some time, of course it is there, but if you look at it, it is li ke number 23 or number 31 or you know, and reproductive health, so part of the issue is just r aising the priority for it because of this issue of the increasing risk factor disparity and effort to eliminate maternal mortality. The Office of Quality and Patient Safety raises an opportunity. Dr. Boufford noted that there is a piece of legisla tion in New York State calling for a Perinatal Review Committee and has not been activat ed. The State Health Innovation Plan, the categorizations primary care that are envisioned th ere now the more advanced primary care category now that there are two instead of three en visions again population health, the visibility role of reproductive health attention in all of tho se primary care practices and Ms. Plavin was very supportive of that effort. 9 Dr. Boufford described efforts in health home. 35 percent of health home enrollees are women of reproductive age between 11 and 50 years o f age. So these are people with at least two chronic medical conditions and/or chronic and a mental health diagnosis. They are the most expensive patients in the Medicaid program. The mo st challenging patients, and 35 percent of them are women who could become pregnant and have c hildren, and of that group actually a 9.5 of those enrolled did in fact because pregnant and gave birth during the last two years. We have agreed to look at that data, see if the implication s, if there were maternal mortalities in that group, see if they were cost implications around th ose pregnancies and those deliveries that were higher than one might otherwise expect. Those conv ersations will go on. Dr. Boufford stated the report summarizes the data on maternal mortality, the discussions we had and the two panels and what we see really as a continuing opportunity to look at the healthcare reform activities as they emerge to alig n action there, and then our plan is to continue shine the light to continue to use the Public Healt h Committee and these forums to bring attention to the issue and the work that people are doing to try to tackle it. There is no one against eliminating maternal disparity. It is an i ssue of trying to get them to work together a littl e more closely than they have in the past. Dr. Boufford expressed she is very excited about th e creation of the New York State Partnership for Maternal Health which involved all of these factors who were all very diligently pursuing reducing maternal mortality in different w ays and have not all agreed to work together and come up with a shared agenda and I think over t he next, by the time we have our next report we will be able to talk about some of the specific plans. They are going to look at the prehospital first, but also aligning their interventions in the inpatient crisis management situation and also with the healthcare reform. Dr. Boufford concluded her report and motioned for adoption of the Report on Prevention of Maternal Mortality in New York State. Ms. Raute nberg seconded the motion. The motion carried.

PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 1 JO BOUFFORD: Good morning to everybody. My name i s Jo 1 Boufford, I'm the vice-chair of the council and I h ave the 2 privilege of calling us to order this morning and w elcoming all 3 of you to the meeting. Jeff Kraut is unable to joi n us today. 4 and welcome Ms. Dreslin who is joining us and will report a 5 little bit later. 6 So let me go through the webcasting rules of the ro ad here 7 for those who are new or may have forgotten. Want to remind the 8 council members staff and audience, this meeting is subject to 9 the open meetings law, is broadcast over the intern et. The 10 webcasts are accessed at the Department of Health's website, 11 NYHealth.gov. The on-demand webcasts will be avail able no later 12 than seven days after the meeting for up to 30 days and then a 13 copy will be retained in the Department for four mo nths. Some 14 ground rules for participation; this is a synchroni zed 15 captioning meeting so it's important that people no t talk over 16 each other and because it makes it harder for the s igner and the 17 people who are being talked over as well. The firs t time you 18 speak, please state your name, and briefly identify yourself as 19 a council member or a member of the Department staf f. This will 20 also help with broadcasting and recording the meeti ng. All 21 microphones are hot which means they pick up every sound so 22 please avoid rustling of papers and side conversati ons. And as a 23 reminder for our audience, there is a form that nee ds to be 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 2 filled out before you enter the meeting room which records your 1 attendance at the meetings. It's required by the J oint 2 Commission of Public Ethics in accordance with exec utive law 3 166, section 166 and the form is on the website for the 4 Department under Certificate of Need so in the futu re you could 5 pull it down and fill it out in advance, and we tha nk you for 6 your cooperation in fulfilling these duties. 7 And, let's see here - so I will start right away I guess. 8 Do we do the minutes first? Thank you. My order h ere is - so 9 let me have a motion to approve the minutes from th e last 10 meeting? Second. All in - thank you very much. Al right. 11 Minutes stand approved, and now - oh sorry. You ha ve been given 12 the dates for 2016 in your packet in advance. I'd like to ask 13 for a motion to approve those minutes - those dates . Second. 14 Alright. In favor and accepted so please be sure t hey're on 15 your calendar. Members of the public be aware of t hem, and now, 16 I'm reading from three different guidance systems h ere. now, I 17 will, now lets move to the report that all of you h ave in front 18 of you and we'll start with reports from the Depart ment of 19 Health and welcome Sally Dreslin who is executive d eputy 20 commissioner of health. 21 22 SALLY DRESLIN: Thank you very much. The anticipati on. So 23 good morning. It's a pleasure to be here today fil ling in for 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 3 Dr. Zucker who sends his regrets. As you know, Dr. Zucker was 1 confirmed by the Senate last month to be the State' s 16 th Health 2 Commissioner. We're delighted to have him at the h elm of the 3 Department. He brings with him an impressive resume that 4 includes stints at the White House, health and huma n services 5 and the World Health Organization. He's a physician with 6 multiple specialties as well as a lawyer and I know he's pleased 7 to be working with all of you in pursuing the State 's many 8 public health initiatives. And we look forward to hearing more 9 from him in the coming months. 10 We've had a few events at the Department since this group 11 last met. In late April, Governor Cuomo received th e final 12 blueprint for End the Epidemic, which is the Govern or's three 13 point plan to move us closer to the end of the AIDS epidemic. 14 The goal of this initiative is to reduce the annual number of 15 new HIV infections to just 750 by 2020. That's a c onsiderable 16 drop from an estimated 3000 cases annually today. I n doing so we 17 will likely achieve our first ever decrease in HIV prevalence, 18 that is the number of persons living with HIV infec tion in New 19 York will start to fall for the first time since th e epidemic. 20 The three point plan includes identifying persons w ith HIV who 21 remain undiagnosed and link them to healthcare, lin king and 22 retaining persons diagnosed with HIV in healthcare to maximize 23 viral suppression so they remain healthy and preven t further 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 4 transmission, and facilitating access to pre-exposu re 1 prophilaxis, PREP, for persons who are engaged in h igh-risk 2 behaviors to keep them HIV negative. To develop a plan to 3 accomplish these three points, the Governor appoint ed the New 4 York State Ending the Epidemic Taskforce which incl uded PHHPC 5 member and vice-chair Dr. Boufford. The recommenda tions 6 included in the final blueprint focus on New York S tate's highly 7 successful existing HIV prevention and care efforts . At the 8 same time the recommendations address stigma and di scrimination 9 in an effort to approve health equity. Governor Cu omo received 10 the final blueprint on April 29 in New York City su rrounded by 11 many of the taskforce members who had worked so har d toward it's 12 development. The document provides New York State with a 13 concrete set of next steps to decrease new infectio ns and 14 improve the lives of all New Yorkers living with HI V and AIDS. 15 Many of the blueprint recommendations can be implem ented without 16 additional resources. Last year in anticipation of this 17 announcement the Governor signed into law several p olicy 18 initiatives including simplified oral consent for a lmost all HIV 19 testing and expanded authorization for data sharing to link 20 persons with HIV to care and treatment. In the 2014 -15 State 21 budget there was included a 30 percent rent cap for clients of 22 the New York City HIV AIDS services administration, HASA, 23 persons with HIV living in subsidized housing in Ne w York City 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 5 will pay no more than 30 percent of their income to ward rent. 1 This will enable them to stay housed which enables people to 2 stay focused on improving their health. In additio n, Medicaid 3 successfully negotiated supplemental rebates for an tiretroviral 4 medications with pharmaceutical companies so the St ate can stay 5 within the Medicaid goal will cap while promoting u niversal 6 viral suppression among HIV infected persons. In th e 2015-16 7 State budget, additional statutory changes were ach ieved 8 including reducing arrests where condoms and syring es are 9 involved and eliminating the requirement for writte n consent for 10 HIV testing in correctional facilities. These chan ges will 11 interrupt the transmission of HIV and assist in ide ntifying 12 persons with HIV so they can be linked with care. The 13 Department of Health also continues to direct resou rces to 14 activities most likely to end the HIV epidemic. In order to 15 expand access to PREP, pre-exposure prophylaxis, th e Department 16 of Health now offers the PREP Assistance Program, o r PREP-AP, 17 which provides financial assistance for patient hea lthcare and 18 laboratory costs. PREP includes regular medical vi sits, 19 periodic HIV testing, screening for STDs and other laboratory 20 tests, and if a person is uninsured or has health i nsurance that 21 does not reimburse for some of the PREP services, h e or she can 22 use PREP-AP to access the services free of charge. And 23 currently a match between HIV Medicaid data and the HIV AIDS 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 6 registry is underway, and the results of this will provide 1 information on the number of HIV positive Medicaid members who 2 are not yet virally suppressed. This information c an be used to 3 improve linkage and retention and care for these in dividuals. 4 An additional $10 million investment in the State b udget will 5 allow New York to enhance existing programs and add ress 6 lingering gaps in prevention and care. To get the word out we 7 launched End the Epidemic marketing campaign in mid -March that's 8 in effect across the State. And the blueprint is av ailable 9 electronically on the DOH website under either Endi ng the 10 Epidemic or ETE. 11 As some of you know on May 20 the Department held i t's 12 first ever cancer prevention summit in New York Cit y with the 13 help of Doctor Margaret Cuomo. The event was well-a ttended and 14 featured an impressive list of top notch speakers i ncluding 15 Doctors Graham Colditz, Walter Willet, and Phillip Landrigan. 16 What inspired the event was this incredible fact th at nearly 17 half of all cases of cancer are preventable. Half. And yet 18 this disease still claims the lives of 35,000 New Y orkers a year 19 and remains the second leading cause of death in Ne w York State. 20 At the summit, the Department and our partners agre ed that even 21 with all the advances in cancer treatment the time has come to 22 renew our focus on cancer prevention. This means en couraging 23 people to quit smoking, maintain a healthy weight, exercise 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 7 regularly and use sunscreen. It means urging people when 1 drinking alcohol to do so in moderation, have their adolescents 2 vaccinated for HPV, take steps to protect themselve s from 3 sexually transmitted diseases, and get screened for breast, 4 cancer, and cervical cancer. It also means forging partnerships 5 and relationships that will help to create communit ies that make 6 it easier for people to adopt cancer preventing beh aviors. In 7 having this conversation and holding this event, Ne w York State 8 is working to win the national war on cancer that b egan in 1971 9 under then President Nixon. In the years since, ad vances in 10 treatment have done wonders to prolong the lives of people 11 diagnosed with cancer, but it's time to get back to an even 12 better strategy to try and prevent the disease from happening in 13 the first place. We look forward to having more co nversations 14 about cancer prevention in the Department and beyon d in the near 15 future. 16 And now that we're in June, we've officially come t o the 17 end of flu season. Ultimately the vaccine that was used to 18 combat the flu season, the flu this season did not match the 19 primary circulating strain. Even so, the season he re in New 20 York was of moderate severity and usual duration de spite it's 21 statewide impact. But for now, flu season is over. And before 22 I wrap up I just want to remind everyone that the w arm weather 23 brings with it tick season and the threat of Lyme D isease. Lyme 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 8 Disease is a bacterial infection that spreads when an infected 1 deer tick bites a person and remains attached for 3 6 hours or 2 more. They're typically active when the weather st ays above 3 freezing, usually from April to November. Not so m uch this year 4 but - while this past winter was unusually harsh, t he long- 5 lasting snow cover likely provided insulation that allowed the 6 ticks to survive the winter. Since reporting of Ly me Disease to 7 DOH began in 1986, New York State has averaged more than 5500 8 new Lyme Disease cases each year. In the majority o f cases an 9 expanding rash resembling a bullseye or solid patch will appear 10 near the site of the bite, and if a person develops an expanding 11 rash with a diameter of more than two inches or flu -like 12 symptoms occur over a 30-day period following the t ick bite, 13 they should contact their healthcare provider, and early 14 treatment is your best defense against this serious disease. 15 And that wraps my comments. Thank you, Dr. Bouffor d. 16 17 JO BOUFFORD: Are there any questions for Ms. Dresli n? 18 No? Thank you. Welcome. Hope we'll see you back again. Sorry 19 you have to leave but, thanks for reporting to us. Give our 20 congratulations to Commissioner Zucker. OK. 21 Let me just review the upcoming events for those of you 22 that are timing yourselves. Ms. Miso will follow s hortly. We 23 will not have a report from the Office of Primary C are Health 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 9 Systems, opposite Health Systems Management today. We will hear 1 from the Office of Health Insurance Programs follow ed by Dr. 2 Gestin and Ms. (Agard) Office of Quality and Patien t Safety 3 Activities on the topic of office-based surgery, an d Dr. 4 Birkhead will give an update on the Office of Publi c Health 5 Activities. Dr. Gutierrez will present regulations for 6 information, then we will go to project review and 7 recommendations and in that context, Mr. Robinson w ill lead that 8 discussion of the committee of establishment. Ad-h oc committee 9 on freestanding ambulatory surgery and charity care , I think 10 you're on again Mr. Robinson, and then we will go i nto executive 11 session for consideration of one case. 12 13 JOHN RUGGE: What about the Planning Committee? 14 15 JO BOUFFORD: Oh! I'm sorry John. Well, you see, yo u're 16 not on this one, but you're on this one. So that's why I'm 17 having a challenge here. 18 19 JOHN RUGGE: Which one is real? 20 21 JO BOUFFORD: Well, this is a really good question. I 22 guess I'll throw this one out and go to this one. So, after 23 Gus, Dr. Rugge, esteemed Dr. Rugge, Chair of the He alth Planning 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 10 Committee will report on the activities of the Comm ittee on 1 Health Planning, followed by Codes, Regulations, Le gislation; 2 Dr. Gutierrez and then moving into Project Review. How's that? 3 Sorry about that. Then, Dr. Grant will chair the d iscussion on 4 the professional case in executive session. 5 So let me remind everyone on the process we're usin g for 6 looking at the applications on members of the counc il and most 7 guests who regularly attend are familiar with the r eorganization 8 and batching of the topics and categories, but we d o batch the 9 certificate of need applications. At this time all of the 10 members are invited to ask if they would like to se e a 11 particular item taken out of the batch for individu al 12 consideration? Any such request from anyone? OK. So they'll 13 stay, as is. And then we have already adopted the minutes. And 14 we have already heard from Ms. Dreslin. So, I will now throw 15 out the fallible list of things I'm supposed to do and move on 16 the official one. 17 This is, the one thing I do want to do before we mo ve ahead 18 though is to indicate that this is the time for us to 19 acknowledge the wonderful service and leadership of Gus Birkhead 20 who will be retiring from the Department. He says. Sylvia was 21 laughing earlier and said, he's had people chained to his desk, 22 we may want to chain him to his desk to keep him fr om leaving, 23 but we did want to acknowledge him during this meet ing because 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 11 he has really been such an important leader in brin ging the 1 public health realities and aspects into the concer ns of this 2 council and obviously has been leading in public he alth and 3 safety for many years hear in New York, and on beha lf of the 4 Council, Mr. Kraut and I have signed a very lengthy resolution 5 of appreciation, but I will read it anyway, because I think he 6 deserves it. 7 He served the citizens of the State of New York ove r the 8 past 27 years beginning his state service in 1988 a s a director 9 of the general communicable diseases program. In hi s tenure he 10 has served as director of the immunization program, director of 11 the AIDS Institute, director of the Center for Comm unity Health, 12 and since 2007 the Deputy Commissioner of the Offic e of Public 13 Health. In his capacity he has been responsible fo r over 2000 14 staff, an annual budget of more than $2 billion and over 100 15 discreet public health area programs. His work in the 16 Department of Health has spanned the administration s of five 17 governors and seven commissioners of health, traine d as a 18 preventive medicine physician and as an epidemiolog ist he has 19 spearheaded many investigations of disease outbreak s including a 20 major measles outbreak that lead to a national, the national 21 two-dose vaccination policy. At the national level , he's 22 overseen efforts to strengthen vaccine financing an d safety of 23 healthcare workers through influenza vaccination. A mong his many 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 12 accomplishments in the AIDS Institute was a major r eduction in 1 mother-to-child transmission of HIV. As a champion for public 2 health Dr. Birkhead advocated the use of public hea lth 3 assessment, surveillance, policy development and as surance to 4 achieve public health goals and led efforts to guid e this 5 council in it's previous incarnation and the curren t council now 6 merged with the Health Planning Council to focus at tention and 7 take action on important public health issues in ad dition to 8 it's responsibilities for facilities oversight. He has worked 9 with the Public Health Committee of the Council to investigate 10 and make recommendations to address the immunizatio n of 11 preschool children to improve the State's public he alth 12 infrastructure, to develop and implement the State' s Prevention 13 Agenda, one and two since 2007 and in 2012 very imp ortantly 14 successfully pursing national accreditation which w as achieved 15 in 2014, the first large state to be accredited. A s director of 16 the State's public health response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza 17 epidemic and 2014-15 Ebola outbreak he kept this co uncil 18 informed and helped to take action to address these challenges. 19 He came before the Council again to argue for regul atory reform 20 to address a multitude of public health issues incl uding spray 21 parks in 2005, prevention of influenza by healthcar e personnel 22 most recently in 2014. Overall his efforts have con tributed to 23 significant health improvements as measured by a 10 percent 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 13 reduction in the premature death rates since 1997, a 43 percent 1 reduction in the number of people newly diagnosed w ith HIV since 2 2000, a 22 percent reduction in smoking prevalence among adults 3 since 1995. His leadership also helped New York mo ve closer to 4 achieving it's prevention agenda goal of becoming t he healthiest 5 state. In America's health rankings New York was r anked 40 th in 6 1990 and 14 th in 2014. Whereas members of the Public Health and 7 Health Planning Council recognize that during his y ears with the 8 Department, Dr. Birkhead has demonstrated a strong commitment to 9 the development and implementation of evidence-base d programs 10 and policies to improve the lives of all New Yorker s and whereas 11 Dr. Birkhead's expert leadership and advice on a wi de range of 12 public health issues has furthered this Council's e ndeavors to 13 improve the health of the citizens of New York Stat e and whereas 14 Dr. Birkhead's scientific integrity w ork ethic and 15 professional demeanor under all circumstances has g arnered the 16 much deserved respect of the Council and his collea gues. Now, 17 therefore be it resolved that members of the New Yo rk State 18 Public Health and Health Planning Council wish to c onvey their 19 deepest appreciation to Guthrie S. Birkhead for his dedication 20 and selfless service to the citizens of our State a nd be it 21 further resolved that the members of the New York S tate Public 22 Health and Health Planning Council feel privileged to have been 23 able to serve the citizens of New York State with D r. Birkhead 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 14 whom they hold in high esteem and offer best wishes for his 1 future health, happiness and professional achieveme nt. Thank 2 you Gus. 3 [applause] 4 5 GUS BIRKHEAD: So, now I am a little flustered, but thank 6 you so much. It really means a lot to get this ack nowledgement 7 from the Council. I was reflecting that I first ca me before the 8 Council probably 25 years ago to a Codes Committee meeting to 9 push for regulations that required healthcare worke rs to have 10 measles vaccination or proof of measles immunity an d a lot has 11 happened since that time. But, really, the Council has been a 12 lot of what's driven what's happened in public heal th in New 13 York and Jo mentioned some of the reports that I wa s associated 14 with, childhood immunization, public health infrast ructure and 15 most recently I think the Prevention Agenda which I think for us 16 the Council and all of us in public health should b e a legacy 17 going forward. Of course, nothing that was just men tioned 18 happened by the result of one person's actions, so I've really 19 been privileged to work with a tremendous team at t he Health 20 Department and at the broader public health communi ty in New 21 York. We really have a very strong public health s ystem. 22 obviously needs more strengthening, but I think we could not 23 have accomplished what we, has happened over these years without 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 15 that strong system, and I thank everyone. And agai n, its been a 1 privilege working with you, and best of luck to you going 2 forward. I'm not going to disappear. I hope to be active in 3 public health to continue going forward. So thank you again. 4 5 JO BOUFFORD: This is great news. I just want to sa y 6 personally it's been a real honor to work with you and see you 7 in all different manner of situations, handled your self with 8 everyone, as everyone has said with the highest lev el of 9 professionalism and responsiveness and the State ow es you a 10 great debt. 11 12 GUS BIRKHEAD: Thank you. 13 14 JO BOUFFORD: That's true. Three walls for of 15 proclamations. Why not. 16 So, let's move back to the agenda then and we will hear 17 from Ms. Misa who is participating via video from A lbany to give 18 us the report on the activities of the Office of He alth 19 Insurance Programs. 20 21 MS. MISA: Thank you and good morning. I'm going to provide 22 a brief update on the recent activities on the Offi ce of Health 23 Insurance Programs. So the Department Continues th e 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 16 implementation of the delivery system reform incent ive payment 1 program, also known as DSRIP, and as part of DSRIP 2 implementation, CMS required the State to move towa rd a value- 3 based payment model over the next five years. The first 4 deliverable is a multi-year roadmap comprehensive p ayment 5 reform. The Department has put together a (VBP) wo rkgroup which 6 has met several times to provide input on the move to value- 7 based payments. The roadmap was posted earlier thi s year for 8 public comment. Comments were incorporated and rev ised version 9 was shared with CMS. This is currently under revie w by CMS, and 10 CMS will be providing additional feedback to the De partment 11 shortly. In addition, the value-based payment work group will 12 break into smaller subcommittees to focus on target ed issues to 13 bring back recommendations to the larger group late r this year. 14 More information including the roadmap, webinars, w hiteboard 15 videos, and other materials are all available on th e DSRIP 16 website. In addition, the office continues to move forward with 17 care management for all. As of May 2015, approxima tely 5 18 million Medicaid members were enrolled in a Medicai d managed 19 care product. We continue to transition benefits a nd 20 populations into Medicaid managed care. In Februar y the New 21 York City nursing home benefit and population trans ition to 22 managed care Nassau, Suffolk, and Westchester trans itioned in 23 April 2015, and the rest of State is scheduled to t ransition in 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 17 July 2015. In addition, we are also in the midst of implementing 1 health homes for children. The Department health h ome program 2 along with it's state agency partners are currently reviewing 21 3 applications for entities seeking to serve children in health 4 homes. Reviews are expected to be completed and des ignations 5 announced later this month. And this concludes my r eport, and I 6 would be happy to take any questions. 7 8 JO BOUFFORD: Any questions from anyone around the t able? 9 No, I think your public provision of information is quite 10 extensive, so there might be - any other questions? Anyway, 11 thank you very much. 12 Alright. Our next report, Dr. Gestin and Ms. Agard are 13 also participating from Albany and are going to giv e us an 14 update on the office-based surgery component of the ir work. 15 Anything else they'd like to tell us about. 16 17 FOSTER GESTIN: Good morning. First, can you all he ar me? 18 Terrific. Well, I guess as a colleague to Gus I wa nt to say how 19 proud I am of all the achievements that you listed off and that 20 how thrilled I am to have worked with Gus for all t hese years. 21 There are things in that description that even I di dn't know 22 that Gus was a part of, so really gratifying to hea r. 23 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 18 What I wanted to do today was to give a brief updat e on 1 office-based surgery. The council has been interes ted in this 2 issue. There have been some interim reports given by myself and 3 Nancy over the past number of months, but as we're getting to 4 the conclusion of our ad-hoc group specifically loo king at 5 adverse events, wanted to give some update. We als o had some 6 new legislation I want to talk about. Is there, sli des going to 7 be projected there? 8 [They are] 9 Terrific. So the first slide on legislative updates , I 10 think the first thing to acknowledge is the work an d support of 11 the Council in helping to successfully bring about new 12 legislation we think will tremendously contribute t o our ability 13 to both understand adverse events and hopefully hav e information 14 and data to help prevent those adverse events that are 15 preventable. So the executive budget included the amendments to 16 the OBS law. The final budget, the final conclusio n changed the 17 legislation in various ways. It gave the Departmen t the 18 authority to collect additional information from of fice-based 19 surgery practices, as I mentioned, which we think w ill be 20 critical to really understanding safety and events, including 21 but not limited to information about the number of procedures 22 collected by practices. Included th e addition of 23 observation stays and unplanned ED visits as other reportable 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 19 OBS adverse events and extended the reporting perio d for 1 practices from previously practices had a day, 24 h ours to 2 report events to three days, which again, we think will help to 3 contribute to more and accurate reporti ng. There is 4 a new requirement for practices relative to perform ing quality 5 improvement and quality assurance activities and so me 6 confidentiality protections relative to that activi ty similar to 7 what institutions have, and there's a requirement t hat 8 accreditation, the accrediting agencies and there a re three of 9 them in New York State that accredit practices. Pr actices 10 requires to be accredited by one of three agencies. There's a 11 requirement that those accreditation agencies carry out and 12 report back on surveys that are performed at the re quest of the 13 Department of Health based on adverse events or oth er issues 14 that may be of concern. There's some strengthening on the 15 credentialing criteria for practices as well that t he 16 accreditation agencies will be using. Now, that's all of the 17 glass-half-full portion of this. There were some a spects of 18 what we're seeking in legislation that did not happ en. There 19 were some provisions that were proposed around cove rage of 20 office-based anesthesia, practitioners, and the con text of this 21 is that there were some offices that are performing anesthesia 22 without specifically surgical interventions. These could 23 include ECT or other kinds of interventions. And t here were 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 20 some thought that would be useful going forward to provide the 1 same sorts of requirements protections for those pr actices that 2 was not covered, that was not passed. There were s ome proposed 3 limits on the amount of time, procedure time and re covery time 4 in an office-based practice that was not passed. T here was a 5 proposal to expand the of the provis ions to 6 podiatrists and performing certain procedures in ch iropractors 7 that was not passed, and there was some clarificati on of whether 8 neuraxial, regional nerve blocks were included and covered under 9 legislation that we've been informally through FAQs advising 10 practices it is covered. We thought it would make sense to 11 clarify that in legislation but that was not includ ed in the 12 final budget. 13 Next slide, just going backwards a bit, going back to the 14 fall we created an ad-hoc committee, mostly formed of a subset 15 of our larger OBS advisory committee but we added s ome members 16 including individuals that we thought would be part icularly 17 helpful to the issue of looking at adverse events. Dr. Gary 18 Kalkut was added, a nurse as well was added to the membership, 19 and as you can see on the slide, we had a number of meetings and 20 conference calls starting in September, we had two further calls 21 pending, one coming up to talk specifically with a gastro - GI 22 proceduralist as we've talked to other societies an d 23 interventionalists. The next slide, in terms of the folks we 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 21 talked to the committee activities, we had consulat ions and 1 conversations and presentations from all the three accreditation 2 organizations, the AAAASF, HHHC, and the Joint Comm ission who 3 presented to us on their quality and safety require ments, 4 accreditation procedures, findings and data that th ey might have 5 had that might be useful or limited to us. We talk ed to a 6 number of professional societies you see listed in there, the 7 medical society, the OBS society, Society of Operat ing Nurses, 8 Association of Radiologic and Imaging nurses, nurse 9 anesthetists, anesthesiologists, the American Socie ty of 10 Diagnostic and Interventional Nephrology, Society o f 11 Interventional Radiologists, Society of Vascular Su rgery; as I 12 mentioned, we have an upcoming call to talk to 13 gastroenterologists, the GI societies. We also in the interim 14 as you may know performed additional focus analysis of the 15 adverse events. All adverse events put a particula r focus on 16 deaths, and we've engaged (iprobe) to provide a sec ond and 17 external review starting with the 2014 deaths and g oing forward 18 to help assure us that our evaluations are complete and 19 accurate, our determinations look for rate of relia bility, and 20 to really provide additional information that may b e useful to 21 us in trying to detect patterns or issues that may signal things 22 that are preventable that we could act on. We're a lso 23 investigating pursing the use of other data systems , includes 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 22 using Medicaid data to look for potential reporting in various 1 areas, there's the United States Renal Data System, there's the 2 Anesthesia Quality Institute, and while none of the se data 3 sources provide all the answers or all the data tha t we would 4 optimally want, they may provide some view or some additional 5 insight may help us either put the information we h ave in 6 context or understand various issues that are of im portance to 7 us. So our plan is to develop a report of the conc lusions and 8 some of our next steps which I'll talk about in a s econd. 9 The next slide, in terms of overall observations, t hink 10 that data limitations which we've talked about I th ink with this 11 group before, still remain significant for us. Tho se include 12 just to recap a likely underreporting of adverse ev ents, true 13 for all data collection efforts and we heard this f rom all the 14 associations and societies about what they see in t erms of data 15 that they collect. We did not have the experience of finding 16 any organization that we felt was collect more comp lete or 17 accurate or specific information than we are of the departmental 18 organizations are collecting information that may b e of 19 interest. We remain having challenges of collectin g the 20 denominator of data so that limits our ability to l ook at rates 21 of adverse events which are really critical, both i n terms of 22 valuating either providers or office-based surgery in general 23 and being able to compare that for example, to othe r venues in 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 23 which care is provided. We think the new legislati on will help 1 us get closer to being able to look at denominators and collect 2 information on the number of procedures, and so tha t I think is 3 positive and good news. And then significant data limitation 4 for us and for the council and for others intereste d in these 5 issues is the lack of any comparators, so the abili ty to be able 6 to judge or evaluate what our safety issues or adve rse events 7 are any greater or lesser in office-based practices versus other 8 settings or in New York versus other states. Right now, as of 9 right now and despite our conversations with a numb er of 10 different organizations the collect da ta are doing 11 some of this work. We lack any clear comparators t hat help us 12 put that information in context. Some of the other overall 13 findings I think of interest is that while the accr editation 14 requirements between the three organizations, signi ficant amount 15 of alignment, there are some issues around which th ey have 16 including around adverse events. And so for example , some of the 17 organizations require specific adverse events to be reported, 18 that they, the accreditation organization names. O ther 19 organizations as practices to identify for themselv es the 20 adverse events that they think are important to tra ck and report 21 on those. So that's a pretty significant variation between the 22 organizations. The other thing is clear to us, and I don't 23 think this is unique to office-based surgery is tha t there are 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 24 not identical one to one matches between specialty society 1 standards and accreditation requirements. Very oft en part of 2 this is accounted for by the fact that often times professional 3 societies will have recommendations that don't quit e meet the 4 level of creation of a standard. So those are 5 some of the general observations that we found over the course 6 of many conversations and data exchanges, and meeti ngs that we 7 had both internally as well as talking to other rel ative 8 associations. 9 The next slide is a little bit of a high level revi ew of I 10 think some of the major questions that we explored. 11 It is not comprehensive but many of them in our fou r year data 12 analysis cases from 2010 to 2013, so this is 13 four years of data. Our focus was really to look a t the deaths 14 that were reported to see if we could identify patt erns or 15 issues that were hypotheses generated from the grou p of things 16 that might've been preventable or consistent causes . One of the 17 first things we looked at was question of whether t his might be 18 related to the procedure itself. We had all those four years, 19 33 cases, 13 percent of all deaths were determined likely to be 20 related to the OBS encounter so that still leaves a bout 2/23 21 that were not. That less of those were events that happened 22 actually on the day of the procedure. So remember t hat we 23 collect information on deaths report ed after 30 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 25 days post procedure, and we have many instances in which 1 following the procedure interventions or 2 hospitalization or clinical events may happen. Abo ut 11, 33 3 percent of related deaths were associated specifica lly with 4 vascular procedures. Most of those focused on pati ents with end 5 stage renal disease and as prior to last year the a dvisory group 6 has been focused in looking on some of the issues t hat present 7 themselves with respect to vascular procedures done on ESRD 8 patients and try to understand what's going on, wha t might be 9 preventable, and what sort of patterns may emerge. The other 10 question from the group was whether this was relate d to the 11 level of sedation, whether we could find evidence f rom our data 12 that that might be contributory factor. I would ju st say that 13 majority of these cases received moderate sedation or less. So, 14 less clear what that specifically level of sedation was 15 involved, but that 30 percent of the related deaths were 16 assigned an ASA score of three. Whether this was re lated to the 17 procedure was another hypothesis that we've been lo oking at. 18 While the data on the lead is not perfect, the majo rity of the 19 procedure, 2/3 or so last less than one hour, so ag ain, this is 20 an area that didn't appear to be significant at lea st based on 21 the data that we saw. And then questions have been raised 22 largely unanswered about the issues about the numbe r or the 23 types of personnel that are present or not present during the 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 26 procedure in office-based settings, and as of right now, this is 1 one of the pieces of data that we don't feel we can reliably 2 report on or analyze. We don't collect this informa tion the way 3 that allows us to clearly evaluate whether the numb ers or types 4 of personnel that are present during the time is co ntributory or 5 might be 6 So, the next slide are continued focused for all ev ents for 7 all types of events are in some of the things that we see are 8 challenges related to limited documentation. We he ard from some 9 practices that some of the documentation may be rel ated to 10 questions or concerns about documenting issues rela ted to 11 quality measurement or quality improvement activiti es may be 12 discoverable. We again, are optimistic that new le gislation may 13 help with some of that, those issues related to doc umentation. 14 Patient selection clearly is still an issue which w e're 15 concerned and focused on. Staffing the credentials to preform 16 various procedures and division of duties and proce dure. Issues 17 about patient monitoring come up, specifically the use of end 18 stage title, CO2 or capnography and whether that sh ould or 19 should not be done. Again, this is one of the area s that we see 20 some but not all the societies making recommendatio ns about the 21 use of this, but none of the associations have hard and fast 22 standards relative to this. Issues about use of Pro pofol which 23 have come up more frequently in GI procedures and p otential 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 27 relationship propofol to adverse events. And then clearly the 1 capacity of practices, office-based practices to re spond 2 adequately to emergencies, the ability to rescue re mains an 3 issue of under conversation. Specifically for vasc ular events, 4 there's some additional issues given the complexity of the 5 patients, the number of physicians and specialists that are 6 often involved. Sometimes the urgency, the need pr ocedure is 7 relative to vascular access. So care coordination, hand off 8 communication, always an issue in healthcare relate d quality and 9 safety, but we think a particular issue related to these 10 patients and then I would say the use of sedation b oth for 11 vascular and for other patients. 12 The next slide, in terms of our next steps, we see 13 ourselves concluding in the next couple of months, adding 14 deliberations of this ad-hoc time-limited committee focused on 15 these adverse events, and that committee will make some 16 recommendations. Those recommendations will go abo ve to the 17 larger advisory committee. Be happy to bring those 18 recommendations forward to PHHPC as well. We want the larger 19 advisory committee which we're looking at the membe rship and 20 making sure that's updated appropriate for 2015 and beyond in 21 terms of our task to the new legislation, we want t hat larger 22 committee to review the recommendations and the fin dings, both 23 of our detailed analysis of the data as well as our 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 28 deliberations with the various accreditation organi zations and 1 societies, the conclusions that we come to in our f indings, 2 identify any recommendations that are actionable in the near and 3 mid-term and then contribute to helping us identify those data 4 elements which we want to collect from practices we think would 5 be helpful in both understanding adverse events and as I 6 mentioned, being able to prevent those events. 7 So I think that's the last slide, and I'm happy to conclude 8 my presentation. Happy to answer questions and wou ld invite - I 9 see Gary's hand up, invite Gary to make any comment s he might 10 want on the process or the findings. 11 12 GARY KALKUT: Thank you. I think your report and th e 13 level of detail and breadth that we've covered in t his group, 14 you were covered in the report, reflects what has h appened in 15 this committee, and I think you and Nancy have done a great job 16 in getting broad input and looking at data that is not unlike 17 data we've seen in this council before that raises more 18 questions, rarely answers questions, but we've look ed at it in 19 multiple dimensions and had been able to at least h ave a better 20 understanding of it's limitations, the numerator an d denominator 21 you raise is a significant one, and there's also th e question of 22 how good the written documentation is. I think the re's been a 23 real focus on even without being able to establish rates, there 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 29 are adverse events including death and what we need to focus on 1 is actionable interventions that can reduce that, e ven if we 2 can't get to a specific rate. Rates certainly woul d be helpful. 3 And I think the way that this has been assembled an d put 4 together really is been a credit to how it's organi zed and at 5 least giving us a chance to get to the best conclus ions we can 6 currently. So, it's been a pleasure to be on the c ommittee. I 7 look forward to contributing to the report that we send, and the 8 conference calls are so interesting, and again, fro m the number 9 of disciplines and number of agencies, societies th at we've 10 talked to, it's very hard to get work done during t hose 11 conference calls. So, again, thanks for the report . - yeah, 12 yes. I accept that, thank you. So let's move forw ard as you've 13 described, and again, thanks for putting such a goo d process, 14 comprehensive process together. 15 16 DR. GRANT: I just had a quick question; I'm wonderi ng 17 what role infections played in the report? 18 19 JO BOUFFORD: Do you hear that question? 20 21 DR. GRANT: Did you look at that? the role of 22 infections? 23 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 30 JO BOUFFORD: Foster, the question was the role of 1 infections in terms of the report. 2 3 FOSTER GESTIN: So, infections and iatrogenic infect ions are 4 one of the adverse events that are reported. I thi nk on that 5 relatively in terms of the specific e vents, I 6 think that you're asking about it's contributions, specifically, 7 to some deaths and mortality. 8 9 DR. GRANT: Yes. Yes. 10 11 NANCY AGARD: The primary cause of death since the 12 majority of the folks who die are end stage renal d isease people 13 who are pretty, a lot of comorbidities, the primary cause of 14 death is cardiovascular related. Our infections th at show up in 15 each of the subspecialties when you look at adverse events, not 16 just including deaths, they are also present in the vascular 17 population which the group that di es most 18 frequently. Infection is a very hard thing to trac k down in 19 that particular population because of the fact that they are 20 entering and exiting the healthcare system with suc h frequency 21 in such a short period of time. Not unusual for us to be seeing 22 these folks, they go to their dialysis center in th e morning, 23 they figure out that their access doesn't work, the y're at the 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 31 upstate surgery practice in the afternoon and they may go back 1 that evening for their dialysis or the following mo rning. So, 2 yes, infections do show up. They're something that 's 3 particularly hard to track down in the vascular pop ulation. It 4 is something we are looking at. 5 6 DR. GRANT: Thank you. 7 8 JO BOUFFORD: Dr. Berliner. 9 10 HOWARD BERLINER: Do you have a sense of how 11 comprehensive the reporting is that is both - are y ou getting 12 reports from all the office-based, the regulated of fice-based 13 surgery practices, and do you have a sense how much office-based 14 surgery is going on that you know, should be regula ted but 15 isn't? 16 17 FOSTER GESTIN: I'll start - Nancy can fill in. I me an, we 18 don't have an impression that there are lots of rog ue practices 19 out there that are performing office-based surgery that are not 20 accredited. And that, based on years of not findin g, not being 21 reported, the numbers that we have seem to jive wit h what the 22 accreditation organizations have in terms of member s. I mean, 23 it's hard to know what you don't know completely bu t I wouldn't 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 32 say never, and impossible but it's not our sense that 1 that's a big issue. Underreporting of adverse even ts is an 2 issue. Again, the accreditation organizations putt ing the Joint 3 Commission, were very frank in their sense that the re's likely 4 very significant underreporting of adverse events a nd how much 5 of that is related to the challenge of a practice a nd 6 performance of procedure today knowing that day 27 what happened 7 to a person and whether they were in the hospital o r had 8 mortality and so on, I think that there are some le gitimate 9 challenges in being able to track adverse events th at are not 10 specifically focused on day of the procedure and th ere may be 11 educational issues and so on, and then there's I th ink just the 12 general barriers or unwillingness to report bad thi ngs that 13 happened, whether it's an office-based surgery from hospitals or 14 any but, Nancy do you have anyth ing, any 15 other ... 16 17 NANCY AGARD: I absolutely support what Foster said. The 18 office-based surgery are private medical practices and in 19 reality are not regulated by us. We sort of had th is quasi- 20 regulation vis-\u00e0-vis the accreditations agencies in requiring 21 that they become accredited and the requirement for them to file 22 adverse event reports, but they're not, they're not like the 23 ambulatory surgery centers to the hospitals. The pr imary 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 33 licensure oversight vehicle of the individual physi cian is the 1 OPMC, so because it's a private practice. As far a s adverse 2 event reporting, our suspicion, our sense is that t here's 3 significant underreporting but what we don't, witho ut 4 denominators we have a hard time really getting a g reat handle 5 on that. Looks like Gary wants to talk. 6 7 GARY KALKUT: I would just add that I think it is, f elt 8 that there is underreporting, or at least that's th e sense of 9 the group, but it's not just a quantitative numeric al 10 underreporting, it's the nature and the content of what's in 11 those reports. There was an early interview in thi s process 12 with one of the staff who reviews those reports and there are 13 many where a conclusion just can't be drawn given t he data. So 14 there's two aspects to it and both I think have bee n addressed. 15 16 JO BOUFFORD: Foster, -- this is Jo Boufford - Foste r you 17 said that you can't compare across states, but I wo ndered if in 18 your investigations you did identify any particular state or 19 area that has what you would consider to be a good example of a 20 system regulating an office-based surgery and what are the 21 characteristics relative to what we're doing in New York or is 22 it just unclear. 23 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 34 FOSTER GESTIN: That's a great question Jo. And I c an't say 1 that we systematically looked across the states, bu t I know, and 2 I'll let Nancy answer this, I know for many years w e've looked 3 to see what other states were doing in this space. I would say 4 many of them have nothing specifically around regul ation or 5 citing office-based surgery at all, but Nancy, in t he years 6 leading up to this is there a state or a system... 7 8 NANCY AGARD: 2013 we looked at the 50 states becaus e we 9 were trying to look at what everybody else was doin g in 10 preparation for our own regulatory, statutory amend ment 11 initiative, and about half the states don't do anyt hing, and of 12 the states that do something only about 20 percent of them 13 require adverse event reporting. Everybody defines things 14 differently. Some states don't allow anything more than local 15 anesthesia to be given in an office. Other states say the 16 minute you get to above an ASA rescore you can only give 17 moderate sedation, you can't give deep sedation or general 18 anesthesia or that have, they define office-based s urgery more 19 like we define ambulatory surgery. So there really isn't a 20 great, if you talk to the accrediting agencies, the y think that 21 we have the best system. 22 23 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 35 FOSTER GESTIN: We as that the nation societies and 1 associations if there's anything going on nationall y that we 2 should learn from or form our process, and unfortun ately they 3 didn't point us in any direction. 4 5 JO BOUFFORD: Well, thank you very much. Any other 6 questions or comments? Raises some real challenges in quality 7 improvement. Systematic quality improvement. 8 Colleagues in Albany and let me move on to Dr. Birk head who 9 will present for the Office of Public Health. 10 11 GUS BIRKHEAD: Thanks very much. I wanted to bring to the 12 Council's attention two new data points that we hav e in looking 13 at disease prevention broadly in the State. The tw o leading 14 causes of preventable morbidity and mortality are s moking and 15 physical inactivity and overweight. So earlier thi s week we 16 announced continued success on the front of reducin g smoking in 17 the state. Our smoking rates and the Governor made this 18 announcement drop to 7.3 percent for among high sch ool students 19 and 14.5 percent among adults generally well below the national 20 average and the lowest points that we have seen in New York 21 since we've been measuring tobacco use. So this is really a 22 tremendous success. A tribute to a lot of work in the clinical 23 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 36 sphere and also in the public health sphere to prev ent youth 1 smoking and to reduce and allow adults to quit smok ing. 2 There's another data point which is not so good and that's 3 our rate of adult obesity and after a number of yea rs of fairly 4 level rate of adult overweight and obesity we've in the last 5 year have seen an increase again, mirroring what's been seen in 6 other parts of the country as well. So, that parti cular public 7 health problem remains a hard nut to crack, and I t hink we need 8 to redouble our efforts and our thinking around how we approach 9 that from both a clinical point of view and a polic y point of 10 view. Remained a pretty intractable problem. I wil l say though 11 on the pediatric front and we measure this through our WIC 12 program that we have had success in actually bendin g the curve 13 in very young children up to age five through using the WIC 14 program to encourage use of fresh fruits and vegeta bles and 15 other sorts of things. So we do have at that end o f the age 16 spectrum have had some success but we need to go ba ck and 17 redouble our efforts I think in the adult area. 18 Just the one other thing totally unrelated I wanted to 19 mention people have probably seen in the press repo rts of Middle 20 Eastern respiratory syndrome cases occurring in Kor ea. There's 21 an outbreak there in the healthcare system. Nosoco mial or 22 healthcare related transmission from a traveler who came back 23 from the Middle East. MERS is a SARS like illness, can be quite 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 37 severe. I think they've had nine deaths in Korea w ith over 100 1 cases now reported. In the U.S. we had two importe d cases in 2 2014. None to date here, but I think this really c auses us to 3 really redouble our efforts in healthcare settings to 4 particularly ask about travel history and that's be en 5 highlighted during the Ebola events, but I think th at's asking 6 about travel history should be a routine in any acu te care 7 setting and not specifically to any part of the wor ld, but we 8 have illnesses now that could be coming from anywhe re and having 9 clinicians and staff in acute care settings familia r with what's 10 happening around the world, where diseases are happ ening and 11 asking have you traveled in the last couple weeks I think is a 12 very key message to get across. We're expecting CD C to come out 13 with an updated alert around MERS in the next few d ays and we 14 will then be putting out a broad alert to the healt hcare system 15 in the State making a number of points, but that be ing a primary 16 one. So, more to come, or hopefully not more to com e on that, 17 but we do need to, at this point in the modern worl d we're just 18 a plane ride away from almost any disease you can i magine and so 19 getting a travel history is really the entrance poi nt to the 20 healthcare system taking the precautions that are n eeded to 21 prevent transmission in the hospital and to get the patient 22 quickly diagnosed and on appropriate treatment. 23 So those are the points I wanted to raise today. T hanks. 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 38 1 JO BOUFFORD: Dr. Birkhead. 2 Alright. Then lets move on to Dr. Rugge, Chair of the 3 Health Planning Committee for his report. I have e vidence here 4 I'm going to pass it down to Colleen that my earlie r script, and 5 I showed it to him to prove that - 6 7 JOHN RUGGE: Thank you so much for this opportunity. 8 9 JO BOUFFORD: You're so welcome, always. 10 11 JOHN RUGGE: By way of historical recap I'm sure eve ryone 12 remembers how we, as a planning committee and a cou ncil suffered 13 through a comprehensive review of CON and an updati ng of that 14 process followed over another year and a half by lo oking at the 15 spectrum of episodic care ranging from full service EDs to off- 16 campus EDs to part-time off campus EDs to urgent ca re and 17 extending to retail clinics. We, again, made a com prehensive 18 set of recommendations and on the executive side ha d a perfect 19 score. On the legislative side we have had a no-hi tter. But 20 the legislature continues to meet and so there's al ways ground 21 for hope. During the last 15 months we have taken a well 22 deserved rest, but during that time I think we're s eeing a 23 proposed transformation of the health delivery syst em like never 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 39 before. One fueled by DSRIP with the major metric being how to 1 reduce avoidable hospitalizations associated ED vis its by 25 2 percent over the next five years. In no small part with that in 3 mind are now looking at a dual kind of focus. One being 4 prompted by the fact that by the end of 2016 there' s a statutory 5 requirement that we as a council update the bed nee d methodology 6 for long term care. This itself is a complex issue with 7 multiple type of beds but even more complex by the fact that I 8 think we're seeing integration of, in a dynamic kin d of process 9 between bedded services and community services in a way that no 10 one expected migration of people out of nursing hom es into 11 community bed settings. But a need for flexibility for 12 accommodation of rehab beds, high acute long term c are beds, 13 It may defy prediction through a conventional metho dology, 14 and I think that by looking at bed need methodology will be open 15 up the whole arena of how do we protect post-acute care services 16 at a time when we're trying to reduce acute care, a nd yet face a 17 state with enormous diversity in terms of urban ver sus rural 18 populations, communities with very different payer mix, and very 19 different expectations. So that this is no small u ndertaking 20 and one that is both arithmetically complex but als o defies any 21 kind of simple arithmetic at all. In addition, ther e's another 22 focus, we are clearly aware that avoidable hospital izations is 23 not a problem for everyone. In fact, it's primaril y a problem 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 40 for people with very complex interlocking dual diag noses. Be 1 they related substance abuse or mental health issue s combined 2 with medical issues. And with that in mind are loo king at 3 especially through the DSRIP process and the regula tory waivers 4 have been extended for merging and morphing service s across 5 sectors and across agencies at, once again, integra tion. This 6 time integration of behavioral health with primary care and 7 medical issues. Understanding that there are a var iety of roots 8 toward integration and merging models that are bein g allowed 9 through time-limited waivers have been extended by the 10 legislature and the Department to the PPS, 25 PPSs around the 11 State. There will be a need to understand which ar e working and 12 extend this council into permanent not waivers but permanent 13 adjustments in the regulatory system. I think in a wareness on 14 the part of the committee that we cannot look to th e regulatory 15 system inspiring or incenting change, but instead m ust be used 16 to support the kind of initiatives that are being u ndertaken in 17 the field. With us yesterday we had a committee me eting to open 18 up the issues and were favored by the attendance of Dr. Seterer 19 of OMH as well as by leadership with Dan Sheppard a nd staff from 20 DOH and I think is a nice example of how we're now extending our 21 reach from one department to indeed all of state go vernment to 22 address issues that are of paramount importance in terms of 23 being able to and succeed in the tra nsformation 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 41 that are being proposed. So we expect to be back i n a year-and- 1 a-half - actually less than that. The schedule is front-loaded 2 so that the principle work and attention over these next few 3 months will be on the side of the long term care is sues and the 4 bed need methodology, so no later than January of n ext year, our 5 policy recommendations are in place so that the Dep artment can 6 proceed with the technical changes based upon those policy 7 insights that we as a committee and a council hope to generate. 8 Concurrently we'll be looking at BHS primary care i ntervention, 9 especially to my mind looking across the state at t hose models 10 which seem to be working and taking effect and then go full bore 11 beginning early next year to understanding of how w e need to 12 adjust the waiver process. So, fasten your seatbel ts and all 13 that. Thank you. 14 15 JO BOUFFORD: Questions for John? I'd like to raise the 16 question maybe having something added to your, at l east, agenda 17 that we would be tracking is I think this developme nt of 18 advanced primary care and the stages of advanced pr imary care 19 and the stages of advanced primary care, again, ope n up the 20 question of the physician practice wh ich came out 21 very clearly in a lot of the discussions you had in terms of 22 figuring out how to define these various forms that have taken 23 route across the State, and it just seems to me all of that 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 42 really is part of a piece, and we really have to ke ep it in our 1 sites, what you've tried to do where it may or may not be moving 2 with the legislature and then how to think about th em together 3 conceptually. 4 5 JOHN RUGGE: Absolutely. Excellent point. The 6 integration of behavioral health primary care can r eally only be 7 done through advance primary care. I mean, there's no way to 8 integrate a conventional or old fashioned primary c are practice 9 because that practice is so consumed with the busin ess of doing 10 what's always done. And here we are trying to brea k the mold 11 and do something very different, so, that is yet an other aspect 12 of what it means. I think at the heart of advanced primary care 13 is advancing from conventional medical diagnosis to a look at 14 the whole person and including behavioral and psych ological 15 issues in a very comprehensive way. 16 17 JO BOUFFORD: Well, and I think we're also hoping th at the 18 population health perspective, looking at other det erminants of 19 health for the most advanced stages of primary care will be part 20 of what gets defined, so this whole look at this so rt of 21 evolution of more advanced definitions of obligatio n and 22 responsibility. 23 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 43 JOHN RUGGE: So you really are trying to sink our bo at. 1 2 JO BOUFFORD: No, no, no! As usual we as a Preventio n 3 Agenda population health will toil away looking at how to put 4 that in, but seriously I think that to the degree t hese are all 5 happening, these are developing at the same time an d you're 6 going to be taking a look like that I think it'd be helpful in 7 thinking about how to make sure they're aligned wit h what's 8 emerging from the APC definitional process. 9 10 JOHN RUGGE: I think that's absolutely right. And a s you 11 start with any of these key issues that quickly exp and and 12 everything else, I mean for one the regulation of t hese new 13 models is only going to have any meaning if there's also 14 reimbursement of these new models, and so at the sa me time we're 15 looking at how to categorize and how to promote the behavior. I 16 think we're going to have to look at what is the ap propriate 17 financial support necessary to affect them across t he State and 18 I would content that validity is better prepared or better 19 situated or better populated than this council, bec ause we do 20 have, indeed, representatives and experts from each of these 21 fields and many of us are living the life and are e xperiencing 22 it firsthand. And so this is my plea to the Depart ment and to 23 the executive to support the effort and to help us to succeed in 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 44 getting our arms around some very, very difficult q uestions that 1 are hard to do, and I think that the PHHPC has an i mportant role 2 that it can play. 3 4 JO BOUFFORD: Mr. Robinson. 5 6 PETER ROBINSON: So, actually Dr. Rugge, I'm going t o 7 direct this question as a followup to your comment to whoever in 8 the Department might appropriately answer it, but t he 9 recommendations that came out on episodic care that Dr. Rugge 10 referred to earlier. Where does the Department and the 11 executive stand on this? I mean, it's unclear whet her there's 12 really been a strong push to move this through the legislature 13 or for reasons that are perhaps beyond the purview of this 14 council it's not something that's a high enough pri ority at this 15 point to push, but is there a plan to move this for ward? Or are 16 we going to live with the status quo for a while lo nger? 17 18 LISA ULMAN: Hi, it's Lisa Ulman with the Department . I 19 think Dr. Rugge had mentioned those matters w hich were 20 administrative in nature have or are wel l underway 21 for those legislative components. I think that the y were very 22 much high priority for the Department and for the e xecutive. 23 That's evidenced by the fact that they were in the executive 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 45 budget. I do think we have to step back and regrou p and see 1 where we are at this stage, but we continue to beli eve that 2 those were very important items, and we do want to step back and 3 take a look at where we are and see where we go nex t. So, I 4 think we'll have to follow up with you on that, but they are 5 very important items to us. 6 7 JOHN RUGGE: One suggestion Lisa, is members of the 8 council have never themselves been mobilized by the Department 9 to try to explain the rationale and if anything to explain how 10 more relevant or important they may be now than eve n two years 11 ago or a year and a half ago when we came out, the number of 12 retail clinics, the proliferation of urgent care cl inics, the 13 number of out of state providers coming in suggest that we were 14 prescient in terms of considering the issues and be fore the cat 15 is entirely out of the bag this would be a good tim e to go back 16 and make a full core press. 17 18 JO BOUFFORD: Mr. Robinson Ms. Hines. 19 20 VICKY HINES: Just to comment on the long term care 21 challenge and the analysis, I agree with you. I 22 think it might defy prediction. But I think one of the things I 23 would just encourage the group to think about are t he unique 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 46 workforce challenges that I think are different fro m region to 1 region so our ability to continue to move folks out of 2 residential and facility-based settings is really o ften 3 dependent on whether or not there are sufficient nu mbers of both 4 paid and unpaid caregivers, and I think in certain parts of the 5 State that is a huge challenge. So I just encourag e that that 6 piece be an integral part of your planning. 7 8 JOHN RUGGE: And one more plea, last time around I k now 9 the planning committee was successful in no small p art because a 10 number of people who were not originally on the com mittee 11 decided to join in. At this point I think we have some real 12 contributors on the council who have not yet been a part of the 13 committee and I'm hoping that Mr. Kraut would be op en to 14 expanding the membership of the committee. We coul d really use 15 the help and the force of arms we have here. Great . 16 17 JO BOUFFORD: If I could just, the magic word 'workf orce' 18 came up, so I just wanted to raise the issue simila rly in the 19 area of primary care. I know, I think it's one of the 20 committees that's supposed to be put together, and again, it 21 deserves attention or perhaps we can get an update on the plans 22 for that. Jeff and I have talked a little bit abou t trying to 23 have sort of regular updates on the many of the mov ing parts 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 47 around reform for the members of the council as we do our work 1 along the lines of what John's talked about, but I think this 2 workforce issue is a really important one for long term care as 3 well as for primary care. 4 Did you have another? Did you have any? Any other 5 comments, questions for John? OK. Thank you very much. Thank 6 you colleagues in Albany. And we now move on to Dr . Gutierrez 7 on committee on Codes, Regulations, and Legislation . 8 9 ANGEL GUTIERREZ: Thank you Dr. Boufford. Good morni ng. 10 My name is Angel Gutierrez, I'm chair of the Codes, Regulations, 11 and Legislation Committee. We met on May 21 to rev iew one 12 proposed regulation which was presented for informa tion. It 13 dealt with computer tomography quality assurance. The proposed 14 regulations will amend part 16 of 10NYCRR ionizing radiation to 15 include requirements with the use of computer tomog raphy CT or 16 CAT on humans within New York State including New Y ork City. 17 The New York City Department of Health and Mental H ygiene 18 regulates the use of ionizing radiation within the five 19 boroughs. This proposed regulation will provide qu ality 20 assurance and safety standards that directly addres s CT physical 21 and operational parameters. The proposed regulatio n would also 22 require accreditation by a nationally recognized ac crediting 23 body - come on computer - that is acceptable to the Department 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 48 which would be consistent with the accrediting bodi es at the 1 Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services accepts. At the 2 meeting committee members discussed the utility and practicality 3 of documenting and sharing dosage information with patients and 4 how such a requirement would fit into this proposal or a 5 proposal in the future. The Department indicated t hat the 6 preference was to move forward with the current reg ulatory 7 proposal but will consider the issue further during the public 8 comment period as suggested by the committee. This proposal was 9 published in the state register on May 6, 2015 and is currently 10 in the later part of the 45 comment period. Since this was 11 before the committee for information. Mr. Damiani from the 12 Department of Health is available to answer any que stions from 13 the council members in Albany. 14 15 JO BOUFFORD: Any questions about this? Alright. L ets 16 move on then. And over to Mr. Robinson and the Com mittee on 17 Establishment and Project Review. 18 19 PETER ROBINSON: Thank you Dr. Boufford. As Dr. 20 Boufford mentioned, we are going to go through this calendar in 21 batches and committee members if, council members i f any of you 22 do want to pull anything out even at the last minut e, please 23 signal your interest in doing that and we'll be gla d to do it. 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 49 Broadly the applications will be in one large set o f 1 batches, one batch on construction and then a serie s of 2 categories under establishment and construction. So we'll get 3 right into it and by putting on my glasses so I can see what I'm 4 doing. And, begin by introducing application 14223 1C, Charles 5 T. Citron Healthcare Center, Inc., in Oneida County . The 6 application is to certify 32 additional RHCF beds t o develop a 7 specialty unit for individuals with neurological di sorders. 8 Both the Department and the Committee recommend app roval with 9 conditions and contingencies, and I so move. 10 11 JO BOUFFORD: All in favor? 12 [Aye] 13 14 PETER ROBINSON: Thank you. We are now done with 15 construction and on to establishment and we'll begi n with 16 category one; first with applications for dialysis services. 17 151005E, Vestal Healthcare II, LLC in Broome County which 18 establishes Vestal Healthcare II, LLC as the operat or of a renal 19 dialysis diagnostic and treatment center, and two d ialysis 20 extension clinics currently operated by Vestal Heal thcare LLC. 21 That application was recommended for approval by th e Department 22 with conditions and contingencies as well as the Co mmittee. In 23 addition we have an application for residential hea lthcare 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 50 facilities to establish 142102E, NHRC Acquisition L LC d/b/a 1 Humbolt House Rehabilitation and Nursing Center in Erie County. 2 And this is to establish NHRC Acquisition LLC as th e new 3 operator of the facility located at 64 Hagar Street , Buffalo 4 that is currently operated by Niagara Lutheran Home and 5 Rehabilitation Center. Here again, both the Departm ent and the 6 Committee recommend approval with conditions and co ntingencies. 7 Application 142221E, Newfane Operations LLC, d/b/a Newfane 8 Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center in Niagara Cou nty, and this 9 is to establish Newfane Operations LLC as the new o perator of 10 Newfane Rehab and Healthcare Center which is locate d on 2709 11 Transit Road in Newfane, and that application resul ts in 12 reduction of 10 certified beds. Again, the Departm ent and the 13 Committee recommend approval with conditions and co ntingencies. 14 Also application 151026E, Katterskill Operating LLC d/b/a Green 15 Meadows Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Green County, and 16 this established Katterskill Operating LLC as the n ew operator 17 of the facility which is located at 161 Jefferson H eights in 18 Catskill and that's currently operated at Katterski ll Care 19 Skilled Nursing and Rehab. Once again, Department and Committee 20 recommend approval with conditions and contingencie s. And the 21 last one in this batch is 151083E, Allure SJA LLC, d/b/a St. 22 Joachim and Anne Nursing in Kings County. And this is to 23 establish Allure SJA LLC as the new operator of the 200 bed 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 51 facility located at 2720 Surf Avenue in Brooklyn. Once again 1 Department and Committee recommend approval with co nditions and 2 contingencies, and I move that batch. 3 4 JO BOUFFORD: Any discussion? Yes, Charles. 5 6 CHARLIE ABEL: Just one note on, this is on 142102, Humbolt 7 House, Jeff Kraut had asked for information on the use sale of 8 proceeds. A letter was sent to PHHPC members relat ed to that 9 and from the Department's perspective it looks appr opriate. 10 Just wanted to bring that to everyone's attention. 11 12 JO BOUFFORD: OK, any other questions, concerns, com ments? 13 All in favor? 14 [Aye] 15 Opposed? OK. Motion has passed. 16 17 PETER ROBINSON: Thank you. We now have a series of 18 certificates. The first is certificate of incorpor ation for 19 Cuba Memorial Hospital Foundation Inc., for fundrai sing. The 20 second a certificate of incorporation for the Osbou rne 21 Foundation, also for fundraising. A certificate of 22 incorporation for the Brookdale Health System Found ation also 23 for fundraising. A certificate of amendment of the certificate 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 52 of incorporation for ECMC Lifeline Foundation, Inc. , that is a 1 name change, and a certificate of dissolution for T hreshold 2 Center for Alternative Use Services Inc. All of th ese are 3 recommended for approval both by the Health Departm ent and the 4 Committee. 5 6 JO BOUFFORD: Motion for approval? Second? Any com ments? 7 Concerns? All in favor? 8 [Aye] 9 Opposed? Motion is passed. 10 11 PETER ROBINSON: This is the second category in this 12 larger batch and this is an application which is re commended for 13 approval, but with a council member's recusal, in t his case Dr. 14 Martin. 15 Dr. Martin has left the room, and this is a restate d 16 certificate of incorporation for the Mt. Sinai Medi cal Center 17 Inc. It amends the corporate purposes to reflect fu ndraising for 18 four hospitals. We noted Dr. Martin's recusal and his 19 departure, and this has the Department's and the Co mmittee's 20 recommendation for approval, and I so move. 21 [Second] 22 23 JO BOUFFORD: Any discussion? Comments? All in favo r? 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 53 [Aye] 1 Opposed? No, Ok. Approved. 2 3 PETER ROBINSON: Ok. Welcome back. This next batch 4 also involved applications recommended for approval and I will 5 go through this first set of, this is home health a gency 6 licensures and I will merely read the numbers of ea ch of the 7 licenses here, and then run through motions. So, b e patient. 8 2228L, 2451L. And this re commendation 13 comes with approval with a contingency from the Dep artment. The 14 committee level, it was approval with a contingency that was 15 recommended similar to the Department's but with on e member 16 abstaining. I believe that was Ms. Hines. And I m ake the 17 motion to approve these applications. 18 19 JO BOUFFORD: Alright. Is there any discussion for this 20 group of applications? OK. All in favor? 21 [Aye] 22 Opposed? No. The groups pass. Ms. Hines abstains. 23 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 54 PETER ROBINSON: This next category includes two 1 applications but I think I'm going to take them ind ividually 2 because we have an interest in one and a conflict a nd recusal in 3 the other. So let me first bring up Home Health Li censure 4 2270L, Caring Hearts of Rochest, LLC, doing busines s in Monroe, 5 and Wayne Counties with an interest declared by Ms. Hines, and I 6 recommend this for approval as does the Department and the 7 Committee. 8 9 JO BOUFFORD: Any discussion of this item? Any comm ents? 10 All in favor? 11 [Aye] 12 Opposed? Motion carries. 13 14 PETER ROBINSON: So Ms. Carver-Cheney - 15 16 JO BOUFFORD: Ms. Hines is abstaining. 17 18 PETER ROBINSON: Ms. Carver-Cheney is a recusal for this 19 application. 20 21 JO BOUFFORD: Yeah, you leave the room. That's grea t. 22 23 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 55 PETER ROBINSON: You're not alone. It happens to 1 everybody. Only the best. Correct. 2 OK. So this is application 2177L, NYC Home Healthc are LLC, 3 doing business in Kings, Queens, New York, Bronx, a nd Richmond 4 Counties. We know the conflict and recusal by Ms. Carver- 5 Cheney. The Department recommends approval with co ntingency and 6 the committee does as well with again one member ab staining. 7 And I so move. 8 [Second] 9 10 JO BOUFFORD: Any comments? Discussion of this item? OK. 11 All in favor? 12 13 [Aye] 14 Opposed? Any opposed? And recusal by Ms Hines 15 (abstention) I'm sorry. Abstain. She's still here . Thank you 16 very much. Motion carries. 17 18 PETER ROBINSON: So with that very exciting process now 19 concluded I turn the next part of the report over t o Dr. Kalkut 20 and both Ms. Hines and I will recuse ourselves from the next 21 item. 22 23 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 56 GARY KALKUT: Thank you. Ms. Hines and Mr. Robinson are 1 leaving the room. This is an application for ambul atory surgery 2 centers. 151008B, Pittsford Pain Center LLC, in Mo nroe County. 3 This is to establish and construct a single special ty ambulatory 4 surgery center for pain management services at 727 Linden Avenue 5 in Pittsford. The Department recommended approval with 6 conditions and contingencies and an expiration of t he operating 7 certificate five years from the date of issuance. The 8 establishment and project review council made no re commendation 9 on this meaning not approved, not disapproved with two members 10 abstaining. And I'll turn it over to Mr. Abel to d iscuss the 11 considerations that the project review committee an d how the 12 Department has approached this. 13 14 CHARLIE ABEL: Thank you. So, this is an ambulatory surgery 15 center application for brand new center specializin g in pain 16 management, and the facility falls within the Finge r Lakes HSA 17 planning region. And a statute requires that an HSA , and the 18 Finger Lakes is the only one that is active, has, i t is the 19 responsibility of PHHPC and the commissioner to tak e into 20 consideration the HSA recommendation. And while we , the 21 Department, is recommending approval because the ap plication 22 meets the statutory review criteria for CON approva ls, HSA, 23 Finger Lakes HSA has recommended disapproval, and d isapproval 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 57 based on need. The need - we had worked with an di scussed with 1 the HSA prior to bringing this to the committee mee ting and the 2 HSA made a very good presentation at the committee meeting in 3 support of it's disapproval. And we completely res pect the 4 HSA's position and the real reason for the disjoint which is 5 very rare, you know, we do take into consideration the HSA's 6 recommendation in our analysis, and it is very rare that we 7 disagree, but the basis for the disagreement is tha t the need 8 methodology that the Department is required to use is concerns 9 different criteria, it involves different criteria than the HSA 10 and in fact, the HSA can use whatever criteria - it s not bound 11 by the regulations as we are. And in the regulatio ns for need 12 as they exist in the ASC, for ASCs, and we've discu ssed this 13 periodically over the years because of the sensitiv ity of 14 ambulatory surgery center applications that come be fore this 15 council and the predecessor council, is not populat ion-based, 16 it's not comparative, doesn't require a comparison of existing 17 providers. It is really, it really boils down to h as the 18 applicant demonstrated that the surgeons to perform surgeries at 19 this center that they have sufficient experience an d their 20 utilization projections are sufficient such that th e revenues 21 derived from those procedures would be sufficient t o offset the 22 ambulatory surgery centers expenses. That was chan ged from a 23 population-based need methodology back in 1998 beca use at the 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 58 time New York State had very few ambulatory surgery centers and 1 it was believed that the regulations were overly re strictive, 2 and by comparison with other large states we clearl y had very 3 very few. We had less than 50 ambulatory surgery c enters at the 4 time. We still have, despite all the ambulatory su rgery centers 5 that have come before this council and probably con trary to some 6 beliefs out there, we have relatively few ambulator y surgery 7 centers in operation now. We 140 acr oss the 8 state. We do have a number in the pipeline that th ey're 9 resolving contingencies, they may be under construc tion and the 10 like, but you know, one could argue that we still w ant to 11 encourage even in the DSRIP world ambulatory surger y centers 12 that are freestanding separate and apart from hospi tals. We 13 clearly want to be sure that more complex surgery p rocedures are 14 being done in a regulated setting rather than offic e-based 15 surgery. We recognize office-based surgery has a p lace in the 16 healthcare spectrum and clearly hospitals do. The basis for the 17 HSA disapproval is just to summarize real quick and I won't 18 overly make their point because you've got document s in front of 19 you, but they, the HSA has said that these pain man agement 20 services are available currently in hospitals in th e region and 21 in office-based surgery settings. Office-based sur gery 22 settings, non-certified settings. We don't dispute that 23 information. We are, 'we' the Department is bound b y the 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 59 statutory criteria as it exists and the statutory c riteria for 1 need and character and competence and financial fea sibility are 2 met with this application. That being said, it's be en since 1998 3 we've had this need methodology on the books, and t his year 4 we've committed to review all of our need methodolo gies to 5 consider what needs updating and does not need upda ting, and 6 we've heard Dr. Rugge and we are very committed to working with 7 the planning committee to bring through this body u pdates on 8 need methodologies, released reassessments of the n eed 9 methodologies for nursing home need methodology, ho spice, CHHAs. 10 We know that just from the periodic questions relat ed to 11 ambulatory surgery center need methodology, we want to be able 12 to look at that. And so, you know, we are committed to do so. 13 We have a full plate. I think we probably have mos t pressing is 14 the nursing home need methodology and so ambulatory surgery 15 centers from our perspective has not yet created a pressing 16 problem that should get bumped up before some of th e other need 17 methodologies. Still, we're going to do what we ca n to run 18 parallel processes on all of these things. 19 So we are content. 'We' the Department. We are sa tisfied 20 with our review of this project. We are content to continue to 21 recommend approval of this project. We believe tha t the 22 applicant has demonstrated that it deserves an appr oval by 23 virtue of all of the CON review criteria for ambula tory surgery 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 60 centers, and we present this project for your consi deration with 1 our approval. 2 3 JO BOUFFORD: Thank you. Dr. Kalkut, I'd like to hav e a 4 few moments for people, members of the committee to speak if 5 they'd wish. 6 7 GARY KALKUT: Sure. I'd just like to make a motion to 8 approve before questioning and then we can go 9 10 JO BOUFFORD: Is there a second? Thank you. Fine. A ll in 11 favor. So we'll have the discussion now. So are t here members 12 or questions from the council or other members of t he committee? 13 I'm advised that we have 14 council members present and we need 14 13 to vote. The abstention question is an issue. So let's talk 15 about what we need to talk about. Mr. Fassler. 16 17 MICHAEL FASSLER: Just a question for the Department . 18 And again, in this case, we have physicians moving 19 form office-based to surgery center. In the Depart ment's view, 20 is a pain procedure more appropriate in a surgery c enter versus 21 office center? Office-based. That was one of the reasons you 22 want to move in that direction. 23 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 61 CHARLIE ABEL: I'll - I know Chris has a comment on this 1 but I'm going to say it really depends upon the nat ure of the 2 service that's being provided. You're going to hav e certain 3 procedures that are more invasive than other proced ures with 4 respect to managing pain and it's really up to the physicians 5 discretion and professional judgement as to what se tting is best 6 for the procedure. At the establishment and projec t review 7 committee the applicant I think made some comments specific to 8 that where the extra precautionary conditions and s afety, 9 patient safety conditions that are present in an am bulatory 10 surgery center were a consideration in some of the procedures 11 and where they should be performed. 12 13 CHRIS DELKER: Yeah, I think further to Mr. Fassler' s 14 question, we really can't get into the business of deciding the 15 setting that's appropriate for any am-surg procedur e. That 16 would just be almost regulating medical practice in a way. What 17 we go by is are the procedures being proposed consi dered 18 surgical, usually by Medicaid and Medicare and the majority of 19 pain management procedures being proposed by this a pplicant are 20 reimbursed by Medicaid under the products of ambula tory surgery. 21 So that's generally what we use as a guide and occa sionally we 22 ask for medical input as well from you know, expert s we might 23 find on this council or elsewhere. 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 62 1 JO BOUFFORD: The members of the committee might wis h to 2 comment. We had abstentions from Dr. Brown and Dr. Martin. I 3 don't know if you'd like to talk or what your thoug hts are about 4 this. 5 6 LAWRENCE BROWN: THank you very much. Lawrence Brow n, 7 first time speaking today. That's an accomplishmen t, I must 8 confess. I guess the thing for me was the conflict, and I 9 appreciate the Department sharing and providing cla rity with 10 respect to it and I certainly can understand that t wo well 11 meaning and well informed entities may come to diff erent 12 decisions with respect to an application. And that to me was I 13 must confess one of the things that was somewhat tr oubling. In 14 a way, I guess partly from Brooklyn, I'm a communit y man and I 15 tend to give favor to local issues and local guidan ce, but then 16 I do understand the State has a responsibility to i n fact look 17 at all the citizens in the State of New York. So I appreciate 18 that view too. I was really mixed on that basis. I think I am 19 clearer now, so I will not have an abstention next time. 20 21 JO BOUFFORD: Dr. Martin, would you like to comment? 22 23 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 63 GLENN MARTIN: So, I mean, I was conflicted because I, 1 again, I was sort of deferring to the people who we re on the 2 ground locally and know what they're doing and actu ally are one 3 of the, seem very confident, have a long history of doing this, 4 did a good analysis and the like. I also understan d the 5 constraints of what the State's operating under whe n they have 6 to make these recommendations. I have to say thoug h that I 7 suspect I'm going to vote in favor of it if only be cause I'm 8 kind of - well, one because I kind of think I've go t to, and 9 two, I am intrigued to see whether or not that grou p has the 10 clout they think they do in terms of the insurers a nd major 11 players because they basically think they're going to make it 12 financially infeasible if they do it. So it's one of those rare 13 situations where the market might actually be intri guing to 14 watch. So it might be a public health experiment i n my eye, 15 which would not be a good point to vote for it, but the fact is 16 I think they do meet the statutory requirements to allow it to 17 be established with all due difference to the excel lent analysis 18 and probably the more accurate analysis being done by the folks 19 in that health planning agency. 20 21 JO BOUFFORD: Dr. Kalkut. 22 23 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 64 GARY KALKUT: Yeah, the outcome on a policy basis of 1 relooking at a need methodology that is 17 years ol d I think is 2 a very important piece of this and the individual a gain caught 3 in that circumstance right now I think is another p oint, but 4 that to me is the larger issue. 5 6 JO BOUFFORD: I think we are, we are to take the adv ice of 7 the local HSA but not be bound by it, so obviously the state 8 statute would presumably be primary, is that right counsel? In 9 terms of our actions? 10 11 JIM DERING: Correct. We're operating under the sta te 12 statute and our regulations. 13 14 JO BOUFFORD: Any other questions or comments on thi s? 15 Yes, Dr. Rugge. 16 17 JOHN RUGGE: I think this is one of those cases wher e 18 difficult cases make either good or bad law, but I think the 19 committee discussion does several things. One is t hat the 20 standard for financial feasibility has really becom e irrelevant 21 in we're dealing with a broken kind of regulatory s tructure, in 22 this case, one that's least irrelevant. Another ke y point was 23 that clearly there is discretionary prerogative for this council 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 65 to make a binding decision based upon the fourth cr iteria that 1 being 'other.' And to my mind what this boils down to is there 2 clearly seems to be a sufficient capacity within th e community. 3 The argument of the applicant is that capacity has splintered 4 among multiple institutions and we'd have doctors g oing from 5 hither to thither in order to meet the needs of the ir patients. 6 on the other hand in the office-based setting, they were already 7 able to do that service, and so it's unclear as to why they need 8 to go hither to, they're already doing it. And the n finally 9 financial feasibility may boil down to whether inde ed the Finger 10 Lakes process will preclude insurance reimbursement making all 11 this moot. Based on that, my feeling is to support the 12 judgement of the HSA and that they are on the groun d, they are 13 local, the know the community, they're dealing with both payers 14 and providers, and I don't think that we as a state wide entity 15 have the need to override that local judgment. 16 17 JO BOUFFORD: Is there any issue about us going in t hat 18 direction? That was the nature of my question was, is that an 19 option available to us? 20 21 JIM DERING: I think the HSA recommendation is just that, a 22 recommendation, and as Charlie has outlined in his memo, the 23 recommendation is inconsistent with our statute and our process 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 66 respectfully so. So, members are free to vote up o r down, but I 1 think we should really follow our state process. 2 3 JO BOUFFORD: Hopefully. Any other questions or com ments? 4 Alright. All in favor? Should we have our hands ra ised? All in 5 favor of the motion raise their hands? Any opposed? OK. We have 6 a - any abstentions? Continuing abstentions? OK. Doesn't pass. 7 13 affirmative. So it doesn't pass. So, what does that mean 8 exactly at this point then. 9 10 GARY KALKUT: Is there another motion? Does anyone on the 11 council, would that be the next step? 12 13 JO BOUFFORD: OK. Dr. Martin. 14 15 GLENN MARTIN: I believe the proper thing is to unli mbo it 16 would be to make a motion to disapprove the motion. 17 18 JIM DERING: Could I speak on that for a second? So , in 19 terms of the unlimboing an application, it seems to be something 20 that's occurring you know, lately. It's happened t wo times. 21 Prior to that it happened, it hadn't happened for a bout 10 years 22 I think. Just want to throw out one consideration and I don't 23 know if the program folks want to speak to it. One option with 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 67 this is bringing it back another time when there ar e more 1 members here. I'm just concerned about the frequen cy, the 2 unlimboing is certainly a good tool, you know, if t here's going 3 to be you know, if the council won't be able to rea ch a decision 4 up or down. I'm just concerned with regard to how many matters 5 or potentially sent to hearing and the resource iss ues in 6 connection with that. So if I could\u2014 7 8 CHARLIE ABEL: Yeah, I think Jim expressed the conce rn 9 pretty well. It's - disapproving a project just to allow it to 10 go to fair hearing I'm not sure is a good strategy. The, and we 11 certainly can with, actually if you do nothing furt her in terms 12 of motions or votes, as no recommendation, we in al l likelihood 13 would bring this back next cycle. Although we woul d appreciate 14 from the group if there is additional information t hat you 15 believe would be helpful in order to make an inform ed decision, 16 I'd be happy to hear that so that we can reach out to the 17 applicant and do that. I shouldn't say, just so th at everyone 18 understands as part of the process, if this project was approved 19 by PHHPC, granted we don't have a full complement o f PHHPC 20 members today, but either today or some other futur e date, the 21 HSA does have article 78 hearing rights. They can request a 22 hearing on their own if they feel so strongly about this 23 project. And the - and I, at it's very core this g ets more 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 68 personal than from the Department's perspective. Y ou know, for 1 folks who believe that the project should be approv ed to vote 2 for disapproval, if that's the alternative motion, just to move 3 the project along the process, to me doesn't feel r ight. 4 5 JO BOUFFORD: I wonder if I could suggest, I just wa s 6 getting the numbers, so the vote here was 11-3. We need 13 to 7 be definitive in one way or another, and we have si x individuals 8 absent. So, I'm going to suggest if we wait until the next 9 cycle and why wouldn't that be the case. I don't k now what we 10 have to do officially to do that. If there's no ac tion to come 11 back to the next cycle, and perhaps people can be m ore informed 12 or others who are not here. NO? Why not? Why is t hat something 13 that's - I mean, not bad idea or good idea, but is it not 14 possible? 15 16 HOWARD BERLINER: But the thing, I mean, 17 18 JO BOUFFORD: Dr. Berliner. 19 20 HOWARD BERLINER: I'm not sure why it would come bac k at 21 all. I'm not quite - why don't we come back at the next cycle. 22 23 JO BOUFFORD: Because it's not been decided. 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 69 1 CHARLIE ABEL: This is an establishment - 2 3 HOWARD BERLINER: We decided not to approve it. 4 5 JO BOUFFORD: No, you didn't approve it, but it woul d be, 6 it's now sitting there are no recommendation bucket . So then 7 presumably it would need to come back again to get an action, 8 unless we decide to act on to disapprove it which w ould be a 9 motion in there with some discussion as to whether that was 10 advisable or not as a strategy, as opposed to havin g it come 11 back the next time. 12 13 HOWARD BERLINER: But why would it come back? 14 15 JO BOUFFORD: Because there's been no action, my 16 understanding is there has to be some action one wa y or another, 17 right? 18 19 HOWARD BERLINER: But no action is ultimately no act ion? 20 21 JIM DERING: There needs to be 13 votes up or 13 vot es 22 down in order for there to be a determination. 23 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 70 JO BOUFFORD: He's asking why would it come back at all? 1 Would it just hang there forever if we haven't acte d? 2 3 JIM DERING: Correct, so - 4 5 JO BOUFFORD: I understand, but my understanding of advice 6 was that if we don't act today it could come back f or a cycle, 7 to the next cycle for discussion and consideration and we have 8 six members who may be there and there might be an opportunity 9 for a vote one way or another. So that's the reaso n for that. 10 11 JIM DERING: Just to get into the limbo issue a litt le 12 more, so, in order for there to be a right to chall enge a 13 determination there needs to be an affirmative vote up or down 14 of 13 members, majority of the council, and so rece ntly there 15 have been two circumstances where the council wasn' t able to get 16 an affirmative vote of 13 up or down, and in order to avoid 17 having the application stay in limbo, so in order t o avoid a 18 scenario where the applicant can't exercise their l egal rights 19 and the application is in essence floating out ther e, the 20 council had decided to deny those applications to l et them go to 21 a hearing. So, to talk about that a little bit mor e, so in 22 essence what we have in those circumstances is it g oing to an 23 administrative law judge and then the administrativ e law judge 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 71 in some regards making the determination. In order for there to 1 be administrative hearing, that involves the prepar ation of 2 witnesses, that involves a hearing that in essence is like a 3 trial, but before an administrative law judge. Tha t takes a lot 4 of resources on the part of the Department and on t he part of 5 the applicants. So, to use that as a mechanism whe n there isn't 6 an affirmative vote is, can present issues from the Department's 7 standpoint. If there was a circumstance where afte r many, many 8 good efforts or after good efforts, it just can't g et there then 9 OK, maybe that's considered. Here where we have a situation 10 where six members aren't here and we only have 13 m embers here, 11 to vote to send that to a hearing, it just seems pr oblematic 12 from my standpoint. 13 14 JO BOUFFORD: Ok, Dr. Berliner, then Dr. Gutierrez, then 15 Dr. Martin. 16 17 HOWARD BERLINER: It's not as if anyone wants there to be 18 an administrative law hearing. It's something that in the past 19 when we've done it it's been in theory to benefit t he applicant 20 so that they can pose a challenge. But the idea th at an 21 application would just keep coming back until it go t a 22 sufficient number of votes to pass seems a little b it - 23 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 72 JO BOUFFORD: That wasn't exactly my purpose. I mea n, my 1 purpose was just to say that we have six people mis sing and it's 2 not like it's a 5-4 or 6-5 with a highly contentiou s discussion. 3 That wasn't the purpose. I was just suggesting we might recycle 4 rather than disapproving and starting a process. 5 6 HOWARD BERLINER: I understand, and it just seems, I 7 mean, so if there were only three people missing, w ould that, 8 and it still failed, would that - what's the number that - 9 10 JO BOUFFORD: OK, let's hear, can we - you want, cou nsel, 11 want to say something? I was going to hear from ot her people 12 and come back again. 13 14 JIM DERING: If you don't mind if I could, so I thin k 15 historically and Coleen and Lisa could probably spe ak to this 16 better than I can, but I think the idea of having a n application 17 come back to revote is not something that's new. I think it's 18 something that's very typical. I think what's atyp ical is 19 voting to send it to a hearing. 20 21 JO BOUFFORD: Doctor, could we just go in order, if you 22 don't mind. Dr. Gutierrez. 23 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 73 ANGEL GUTIERREZ: Dr. Berliner already eloquently 1 expressed what I wanted to say, however semanticall y the 2 creators of limbo, back in the medieval times have recently 3 decided a limbo no longer exists. So we need to co me up with 4 some other semantic way of saying what we are tryin g to say. 5 6 JO BOUFFORD: Dr. Martin then Dr. 7 8 GLENN MARTIN: I have no particular expertise in lim bo. My 9 tribe got through millennia without it. But I'm ju st concerned 10 procedurally, what are we doing? Because I would b e happy to 11 postpone it but it already seems to me it has been addressed and 12 is off the agenda. So It's unclear to me what's ac tually 13 happening. 14 15 JO BOUFFORD: Why has it been - that part - 16 17 GLENN MARTIN: Well, we voted on it, we took action. I 18 mean, it may have failed, but - 19 20 JO BOUFFORD: The action is no recommendation. Right ? 21 22 CHRIS DELKER: You didn't take action because there was no 23 decision reached. 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 74 1 JO BOUFFORD: the decision was that we didn't have e nough 2 votes to pass it. 3 4 JOHN RUGGE: Just point of information, 5 6 JO BOUFFORD: Let me see if he's finished with the 7 comment. 8 9 GLENN MARTIN: I'm not an expert in parliamentary pr ocedure 10 or anything else, it just seems to me that it faile d. I don't 11 know who would put it on the agenda for next month. Sounds like 12 the State was going to do that, but that's not nece ssarily what 13 happens automatically. So, I'm not sure - 14 15 JO BOUFFORD: Mr. Dering, do you want to clarify tha t 16 question? It's a procedural question. 17 18 JIM DERING: In order for there to be an action, the re 19 have to be 13 votes. So, up or down. So if there aren't 13 20 votes, there's no action. 21 22 GLENN MARTIN: Alright. But I guess - 23 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 75 JO BOUFFORD: He's asking where does the decision co me to 1 bring it back if that is an option? Would we need to affirm 2 that or would that be something the Department do? That's 3 really what you're asking? Let me ask Dr. Rugge to make his 4 comment and then Charlie. 5 6 JOHN RUGGE: Just a point of information, who sets t he 7 agenda? Is it the commissioner or is it the chair of the 8 council? I think that's probably not our job. Whoe ver sets the 9 agenda needs to decide whether to bring it back or not. Who 10 does set the agenda? 11 12 CHARLIE ABEL: The commissioner does set the agenda. And 13 to answer Dr. Martin's question we, it is not autom atic that a 14 project that receives no recommendation come back t he next 15 cycle. And this has happened numerous other times when there's 16 been no recommendation. And the project remains a p ending 17 project for us if it's an establishment project, be cause the 18 commissioner cannot be the decider on establishment projects. 19 This body is. If it does not make a decision as to approval or 20 disapproval, then it remains a pending project for us. If there 21 are again, if there are specifics that this body wo uld like the 22 applicant to provide in terms of information or doc ument, 23 whatever, we can, the Department staff can work wit h the 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 76 applicant to provide that and while the Department is bound by 1 the three statutory criteria as we've described in the 2 regulations to implement the statute, someone menti oned earlier 3 that this body does have the fourth criteria which is all other 4 such matters it deems necessary. So, the, if there is something 5 that you feel is needed to complete this applicatio n, 6 information submitted that you would need to render a decision, 7 we can work with the applicant on those requests. 8 9 JO BOUFFORD: Dr. Martin and then Dr. Kalkut. Dr. B rown, 10 sorry, then Dr. Kalkut. 11 12 LAWRENCE BROWN: I appreciate the information that 13 colleagues and Department has provided and counsel provided. 14 I'm sure I think we should move the agenda. I'm no t sure we're 15 going to get any more information that's going to b e - unless 16 someone's going to make a motion to disapprove, I t hink we need 17 to move the agenda. 18 19 GARY KALKUT: My question was also a procedural one 20 related to disapproval. If there was a motion to d isapprove and 21 that did not pass with all the requisits, what's a yes and 22 what's a no? does that change the, how this is han dled in terms 23 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 77 of putting back on the agenda or not? Because righ t now we just 1 have a no decision on an approval motion. 2 3 JIM DERING: Sure, if there was a no decision on a 4 disapproval we would be in the same spot that we're in now. So 5 it wouldn't change. 6 7 JO BOUFFORD: So- 8 9 LAWRENCE BROWN: My motion on the table is to move t he 10 agenda. 11 12 JOHN RUGGE: is a motion to disapprove it passes the n it 13 can't come back. 14 15 JO BOUFFORD: would somebody like to move - 16 17 JIM DERING: Correct. 18 19 JO BOUFFORD: Is there, except through this hearing 20 process that he described earlier would precipitate the 21 opportunity for a hearing if they wish to pursue it . 22 23 JIM DERING: And just to comment on the - 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 78 1 JO BOUFFORD: We proceeded, his motion was to keep g oing 2 and leave it where it is. I'm sorry? 3 4 JIM DERING: If I could make one comment. And I wou ld 5 hope that - I think the in my opinion, the goal of PHHPC should 6 be to reach a determination on matters at least 13 up or 13 7 down. I would hope that I this circumstance based on my 8 comments I would hope that people wouldn't disappro ve merely to 9 send it, to create the hearing right. 10 11 JO BOUFFORD: So I guess, so your motion is to leave the 12 decision as it was and move on. 13 Second. 14 Alright. Any discussion of that motion? OK. All in 15 favor? 16 [Aye] 17 Opposed? Any abstentions. OK. Stays 11-3. No 18 recommendation. And I guess the commissioner can d ecide the 19 disposition. The establishment committee can - I th ought you 20 said earlier the commissioner sets the agenda. No, I 21 understand. That's what I meant. He can decide wh ether to put 22 it on the agenda again. Thank you very much. 23 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 79 OK. Mr. Robinson, would you like to move ahead on the, 1 hear a report on the ad-hoc committee on freestandi ng ambulatory 2 surgery centers and charity care. 3 4 PETER ROBINSON: It would be my honor. I assume the n 5 the report of the committee on establishment is con cluded. 6 7 JO BOUFFORD: It is concluded. 8 9 PETER ROBINSON: Excellent. Ok. Well, I do want to 10 thank first of all the members of the ad-hoc commit tee on 11 ambulatory surgery and charity care, and especially Mr. Delker 12 from the Department who has done yeoman's work in b ringing us 13 this far. You have a copy of the draft report in t he material 14 that you got in advance. So I just want to highlig ht a couple 15 of things in it and then get your feedback. We are not going to 16 ask for action on the report at this meeting. We w ill be having 17 another cycle on committee day so that we can get i nput from 18 other members of the industry that are interested i n providing 19 that input and trying to incorporate that into anyt hing that we 20 finalize. So I just ask committee members to give us your 21 thoughts now so that we can incorporate that thinki ng as well. 22 So, just to recall, the committee was organized in order to take 23 a look at why freestanding ambulatory surgery cente rs were 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 80 falling short in reaching their projected number of cases for 1 the underserved, and I think we were especially foc used on the 2 inability of many if not almost all of these center s to meet 3 their charity care goals, and this became apparent as we began 4 to look at those centers that were coming up on the end of their 5 five year limited life, and then needed to be consi dered for 6 either perpetual life if that's possible I this wo rld, but at 7 least a more permanent status. So, we had a series of four 8 meetings beginning in September of last year, so th is has been 9 ongoing for a while. And we did hear from ambulator y surgery 10 center operators, some consumer groups came in, the FQHCs were 11 also involved in providing us with input, and some very 12 important suggestions from the New York State assoc iation of 13 ambulatory surgery centers as well as other stakeho lders. And 14 here we were looking at trying to get to the practi cal aspects 15 of making sure that these centers were reaching and serving 16 uninsured and Medicaid clients and we heard especia lly about how 17 the services and the characteristics of these, of i ndividual 18 ambulatory surgery centers which were driven in par t by 19 circumstances of geography and healthcare markets i n which each 20 operate. That that creates some real complications . So, as an 21 example, centers that focus exclusively on ophthalm ology are 22 almost going to see entirely a Medicare related pop ulation and 23 so we began to struggle with this one size fits all kind of 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 81 approach to handling these charity care obligations and I think 1 that certainly came out in the conversation. The ot her thing 2 that we're paying attention to is the changing land scape. So in 3 addition to those circumstantial factors, we had a report 4 earlier about DSRIP and the impact that DSRIP is go ing to have, 5 the expansion of coverage so that the number of peo ple in New 6 York State that are uninsured is being dramatically reduced with 7 significant numbers going into Medicaid programs an d others 8 getting coverage through the exchanges. The struct ure of PPSs 9 themselves as part of DSRIP is going to matter in t erms of 10 managing access and how patients are going to be or ganized to 11 access care through these PPSs. So that's going to also be 12 important. 13 So where we are at the moment, and this is what the report 14 reflects, we concluded that there is no specific mi nimum or 15 optimum proportion of Medicaid and charity care cas es that can 16 be prescribed uniformly for ambulatory surgery cent ers. And so 17 we're going to recommend at least at this point and I think this 18 is where we remain open for input that the assessme nt of 19 Medicaid and charity care efforts for each ambulato ry surgery 20 center be undertaken with regard to the individual 21 characteristics of each applicant and the circumsta nces 22 including the types of surgical procedures that are being 23 proposed, how those services align with the rest of the 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 82 organization of healthcare services in the market t hat they 1 operate in, and also just geographically where the uninsured and 2 the Medicaid populations live in relation to these ambulatory 3 surgery centers. 4 We think that these kinds of assessments could be d one 5 prospectively when applications come in so that we can establish 6 some realistic goals that are relevant to each cent er and then 7 use the five-year limited life period as a way of a ssessing them 8 against almost a tailored set of standards and requ irements. And 9 what you can do is see in the paper that we submitt ed some of 10 the review criteria we're looking at. So, I think this is kind 11 of where we are at the moment. I would say that we had a set of 12 key points that came up at the last meeting. One wa s the need 13 for better monitoring of ambulatory surgery centers in advance 14 of the five year limited life renewal, so getting f eedback here 15 to the council in advance of the end of the life, s o we only 16 have one shot at looking at this, but rather can re view and 17 provide further input to the Department on these ap plications 18 that looks particularly at their Medicaid participa tion in 19 charity care rates. 20 The other thing is that this interface between char ity care 21 and bad debt is likely to become a more prominent i ssue, we 22 think. When you look at how people access coverage through the 23 exchange especially with these medal levels now whe re patient 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 83 responsibilities can range from 10 percent to up to 40 percent 1 of the cost of healthcare, for many people who take those lower 2 levels of coverage, their the ones that probably ha ve the most 3 limited ability to provide payment and so we fully anticipate 4 that bad debt is going to be a bigger factor for am bulatory 5 surgery centers and other providers as well in the future. So, 6 we need to think about how we interface with that, but actually 7 also look to the ambulatory surgery centers as part of the 8 individual tailored plan that we might put into pla ce to not 9 necessarily expect but maybe to define proactively charity care 10 for some part of that patient contribution for thos e patients 11 that might be eligible for it. So, just a factor t hat we're 12 kind of going to be looking at. 13 I know that just since this draft report was issued , Mr. 14 Delker got some sort of additional information on t he 15 contribution that existing ambulatory surgery cente rs are making 16 to the bad debt and charity care pools in the State , and I 17 wonder, Chris, if you wouldn't mind commenting on t hat. 18 19 CHRIS DELKER: We had earlier put together informat ion 20 that was not complete in the sense that it represen ted only the 21 amount that the ASCs were unable to collect from th e payers and 22 had to pay directly into the pool and that was abou t $3 to $4 23 million a year. The HICRA surcharge ambulatory sur gery services 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 84 delivered by freestanding providers, not hospital p roviders is 1 9.6 percent for commercial and indemnity plans and commercial 2 managed care plans and it's about 7 percent on Medi caid, the 3 non-State, State share of Medicaid and other govern ment payers 4 like workers compensation. The total of that contri bution, that 5 surcharge on ambulatory surgery centers over the si x year period 6 of 2009 to 14 inclusive was $1.7 billion. So, the freestanding 7 ambulatory surgery activities represent a subsidy i f you will to 8 the hospital safetynets and other eligible safetyne t providers 9 of that averages about $285 million a year, althoug h the average 10 has been higher in recent years as the number of am -surge 11 centers has increased. So I think that provides mo re of a 12 context for consideration of charity care and suppo rt of the 13 underserved. There's already a transfer if you wil l of funds 14 from ambulatory surgery centers into the safety net that's 15 occurring by statute. In addition to the considerat ions this 16 committee might want to add to providers for direct charity care 17 and active enrolment of Medicaid clients. 18 19 PETER ROBINSON: Well, thank you for that comment, 20 Chris. I'm going to just open it up, Dr. Rugge. 21 22 JOHN RUGGE: As you suggested, bad debt is not the 23 equivalent of charity care. It is not fair to look at 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 85 increasing bad debt as a substitute for charity car e because 1 that does place a burden on patients and also a det erent to 2 care. One idea that only occurred to me now is that all FQHCs as 3 you probably know are required to have a sliding fe e schedule, 4 and I know very well of one FQHC that is solicited acceptance of 5 the sliding fee scale by specialty providers and ha ve received 6 that. In this case, I wonder if that might serve a s a proxy for 7 meeting the charity care requirement, that if a sur gical center 8 went to the FQHCs in this community, accepted patie nts on 9 referral using the sliding fee, that there be no mo re arithmetic 10 necessary to demonstrate commitment to the underser ved. 11 12 PETER ROBINSON: As we begin to think about that ver y 13 issue, I think the idea of a sliding scale does mak e a lot of 14 sense, and I think we are going to at least give co nsideration 15 to including that as part of our recommendation. S o thank you 16 for that comment. I think it's right on target. A nd it is not 17 easy to develop a sliding fee and it's not easy to receive from 18 patients family income of the rest, so by already p lugging into 19 an existing system which FQHCs are mandated to have , may 20 mobilize this in a way that's simply saying go ahea d and develop 21 a sliding fee and then let us decide if that slidin g fee is 22 really fair or not. I'm just saying maybe good to use a 23 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 86 prebuilt mechanism rather than require the developm ent of a 1 whole new system. 2 3 PETER ROBINSON: Thank you for that. I think - than k 4 you for those suggestions. Other comments? Observat ions? 5 6 JO BOUFFORD: I had another question when you were 7 proposing this issue of better monitoring before re newal. Would 8 a renewal for this perpetual license you talk about , would that 9 be normally coming to the council or would that be 10 administrative? Because I wasn't aware that it cam e back to us. 11 12 CHRIS ROBINSON: Well, the ones that were approved 13 within the last, what is it, five years, last - tho se approved I 14 the last three years don't have to come back. That' s 15 administrative. But those beforehand, you recall th ere was a 16 policy change for that a couple years ago. Those b eforehand 17 still have to come back and you're seeing some of t hose now that 18 are coming back for permanent establishment, if you will. But as 19 to the monitoring a suggestion was made at the last meeting was 20 that the Department perhaps every six months give t he council a 21 list of those five years that you still have author ity over and 22 how they're doing at what interval, and so that wou ld enable use 23 to certainly advise them, you need to increase your Medicaid or 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 87 charity care uncompensated care, whatever, well in advance of 1 the five years, and it would also give this council as Peter 2 said at the beginning, some sort of a heads up abou t which ones 3 might be coming down instead of just having to make the decision 4 on the information given to you at one meeting. 5 6 PETER ROBINSON: right, and I think even for those t hat 7 the council does not have any direct responsibility for now 8 getting those interim reports even depending on, re gardless of 9 the, whether they're before and after the change in the CON 10 thresholds, that I think that would help inform the council in 11 terms of how effective the guidelines were that we' ve been 12 establishing and whether we're having problems with them still 13 or not. 14 15 JO BOUFFORD: So that would be part of your final 16 recommendation - define both of those elements that you 17 described. 18 19 PETER ROBINSON: We're looking at incorporating thos e 20 things in the final draft. Right. 21 22 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 88 JO BOUFFORD: Dr. Martin, you had a comment? Dr. Mar tin. 1 Dr. Brown. I don't know why I keep calling you Dr. Martin. Dr. 2 Brown. 3 4 LAWRENCE BROWN: Well, we're both on two similar 5 advisory councils, I guess that's the reason. 6 7 JO BOUFFORD: I doubt it very seriously. 8 9 LAWRENCE BROWN: I guess, I need some clarification. 10 That there has been limited life approvals. If the y occurred 11 before three years ago, there was a difference abou t whether or 12 not they come back before the council? I'm not sure I understood 13 that. 14 15 CHARLIE ABEL: Sure. I can explain. As part of this 16 council's CON streamlining work that came out of Dr . Rugge's 17 planning committee, the recommendation was that for limited life 18 approvals on going forward basis. The operating ce rtificate 19 would be limited, not the establishment approval wh ich had been 20 the case. And that if, so those limited life approv als when they 21 were due for review the department would do the rev iew 22 administratively. We could choose to as we have in some cases 23 extent a limited life for some defined duration. I f they did 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 89 not, if the applicant did not meet all of their com mitments or 1 approve if they had, and clearly if the applicant o r the 2 provider at that point in the limited life applying for 3 perpetual life, if they clearly were not living up to their 4 promises, then the Department would be in a positio n to 5 recommend that the application not be approved. In those cases, 6 those applications would come to this council, but if the 7 Department were to approve one of these post-CON re form limited 8 operating certificate approvals then this body woul d not see 9 those approvals. 10 11 LAWRENCE BROWN: I guess the reason I raise that is I know 12 that during my short stay on this council we've ask ed the 13 Department for a lot of data to inform our decision making, and 14 I guess I'm a bit concerned going forward that this process 15 allows us - I'm trying to be really, I understand t hat the 16 Department is doing the best that it could be, but I've come to 17 appreciate there are some times during these counci l meetings 18 that we've come to a point that we don't believe we have enough 19 information to make a decision. Now we're asking y ou to with 20 this proposal to me, provide more data and some of it in an 21 administrative and not coming back. So, please forg ive me, I'm a 22 little uncomfortable with that. Just a statement o f my comfort 23 level. Thank you for allowing me that. 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 90 1 JO BOUFFORD: Alright, any other statements of comfo rt or 2 discomfort. Oh, I think it's Peter's group is putt ing their 3 final report together working with staff it's impor tant to have 4 those concerns articulated. 5 6 PETER ROBINSON: So we welcome all of you to partici pate 7 in the committee day and sit in on the ad-hoc commi ttee meeting 8 which is going to be part of the committee day and continue to 9 provide input to this process, so thank you. 10 11 JO BOUFFORD: Thank you very much. Yes, Dr. Rugge. 12 13 JOHN RUGGE: Peter, do you expect this to be the fin al 14 committee meeting and then we'll be ready to go? 15 16 PETER ROBINSON: I do. 17 18 JO BOUFFORD: Any other comments, questions? Alrigh t. 19 Fine. I think that concludes our business unless t here's any 20 other business for the public session? Hearing none , I will ask 21 for a motion to - I guess I can declare us adjourne d, can I not? 22 Thank you, I declare this meeting adjourned, and we will go into 23 executive session for report of the committee on he alth 24 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL JUNE 11, 2015 90 CHURCH STREET, CR 4A AND 4B 91 personnel interprofessional relations. Dr. Grant w ill be 1 chairing that.

Refill, re8establish treatment and retest for verif ication of treatment. 12 Regulatory Impact Statement Statutory Authority: The Public Health and Health Planning Council (PHH PC) is authorized by Section 225 of the Public Health Law (PHL) to establish, amend and repeal sanitary regulations to be known as the State Sanitary Code (SSC) subject to the approv al of the Commissioner of Health. PHL Section 225(5)(a) provides that the SSC may deal wi th any matter affecting the security of life or health, or the preservation or improvement of publi c health, in the state of New York. Legislative Objectives: This rulemaking is in accordance with the legislat ive objective of PHL Section 225 authorizing the PHHPC, in conjunction with the Comm issioner of Health, to protect public health and safety by amending the SSC to address is sues that jeopardize health and safety. Specifically, these regulations establish requireme nts for cooling towers relating to: registration, reporting and recordkeeping; testing; cleaning and disinfection; maintenance; inspection; and certification of compliance. Additionally, these r egulations require general hospitals and nursing homes to implement a Legionella sampling plan and take necessary responsive action s, as the department may deem appropriate. Needs and Benefits: Improper maintenance of cooling towers can contribu te to the growth and dissemination of Legionella bacteria, the causative agent of legionellosis. O ptimal conditions for growth of Legionella include warm water that is high in nutrients and p rotected from light. People are exposed to Legionella through inhalation of aerosolized water containing the bacteria. Person813 to8person transmission has not been demonstrated. Symptoms of legionellosis may include cough, shortness of breath, high fever, muscle ache s, and headaches, and can result in pneumonia. Hospitalization is often required and b etween 5830% of cases are fatal. People at highest risk are those 50 years of age or older; cu rrent or former smokers; those with chronic lung diseases; those with weakened immune systems f rom diseases like cancer, diabetes, or kidney failure; and those who take drugs to suppres s the immune system during chemotherapy or after an organ transplant. The number of cases of l egionellosis reported in New York State between 200582014 increased 323% when compared to t hose reported in the previous ten year period. Outbreaks of legionellosis have been associated wit h cooling towers. A cooling tower is an evaporative device that is part of a recirculate d water system incorporated into a building 's cooling, industrial process, refrigeration, or ener gy production system. Because water is part of the process of removing heat from a building, these devices require disinfectants \u2014chemicals that kill or inhibit bacteria (including Legionella )\u2014as means of controlling bacterial overgrowth. Overgrowth may result in the normal mists ejected f rom the tower having droplets containing Legionella . For example, in 2005, a cooling tower located at gr ound level adjacent to a hospital in New Rochelle, Westchester County resulted in a clus ter of 19 cases of legionellosis and multiple fatalities. Most of the individuals were dialysis patients or companions escorting the patients to their dialysis session. One fatality was in the lo cal neighborhood. The cooling tower was found to have insufficient chemical treatment. The entir e tower was ultimately replaced by the manufacturer in order to maintain cooling for the h ospital and to protect public health. In June and July of 2008, 12 cases of legionellosis includi ng one fatality were attributed to a small evaporative condenser on Onondaga Hill in Syracuse, Onondaga County. An investigation 14 found that the unit was not operating properly and this resulted in the growth of microorganisms in the unit. Emergency biocide treatment was initi ated and proper treatment was maintained. No new cases were then detected thereafter. Recent work has shown that sporadic cases of commun ity legionellosis are often associated with extended periods of wet weather wit h overcast skies. A study conducted by the New York State Department of Health that included d ata from 13 states and one United States municipality noted a dramatic increase in sporadic, community acquired legionellosis cases in May through August 2013. Large municipal sites suc h as Buffalo, Erie County reported 28 to 38 fold increases in cases without identifying common exposures normally associated with legionellosis. All sites in the study except one h ad a significant correlation, with some time lag, between legionellosis case onset and one or more we ather parameters. It was concluded that large municipalities produce significant mist (drop let) output from hundreds of cooling towers during the summer months. Periods of sustained pre cipitation, high humidity, cloud cover, and high dew point may lead to an \"urban cooling tower \" effect. The \"urban cooling tower \" effect is when a metropolitan area with hundreds of cooling t owers acts as one large cooling tower producing a large output of drift, which is entrapp ed by humid air and overcast skies. More recently, 133 cases of legionellosis, which in cluded 16 fatalities, occurred in Bronx, NY (July8September, 2015). This event was preceded by an outbreak in Co8Op City in the Bronx, from December 2014 to January 2015, which in volved 8 persons and no fatalities. Both of these outbreaks have been attributed to cooling towers, and emergency disinfection of compromised towers helped curtail these outbreaks. These events highlight the need for proper maintenance of cooling towers. 15 The heating, ventilation, and air8conditioning (HVA C) industry has issued guidelines on how to: seasonally start a cooling tower; treat it with biocides and other chemicals needed to protect the components from scale and corrosion; se t cycles of operations that determine when fresh water is needed; and shut down the tower at t he end of the cooling season. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air8Condition ing Engineers (ASHRAE) has recently released a new Standard entitled Legionellosis: Risk Management for Building Water S ystems (ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 18882015). Section 7.2 of th at document outlines components of the operations and management plan for cooling towers. The industry also relies on other guidance for specific treatment chemicals, emergency disinfe ction or decontamination procedures, and other requirements. However, none of the guidance is obligatory. Conse quently, maintenance deficiencies such as poor practice in operation and management c an result in bacterial overgrowth, increases in Legionella , and mist emissions that contain pathogenic legion ellae. This regulation requires that all owners of cooling towers ensure proper mai ntenance of the cooling towers, to protect the public and address this public health threat. Further, these regulations requires that all owners of cooling towers ensure proper maintenance of the cooling tower Legionella sampling plan for their potable water system, repo rt the results, and take necessary actions to protect the safety of their patients or residents, as the Department may deem appropriate. The details of ea ch facility's sampling plan and remedial measures will depend on the risk factors for acquir ing Legionnaires' disease in the population served by the hospital or nursing home. Most people in nursing homes should be considered a t risk, as residents are typically over 50 years of age. In general hospitals, persons at risk include those over 50 years of age, as well 16 as those receiving chemotherapy, those undergoing t ransplants, and other persons housed on healthcare units that require special precautions. Additional persons who might be at increased risk for acquiring Legionnaires' disease include pe rsons on high8dose steroid therapy and persons with chronic lung disease. Certain facilit ies with higher risk populations, such as those with hematopoietic stem8cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplant units, require more protective measures. An environmental assessment involves reviewing faci lity characteristics, hot and cold water supplies, cooling and air handling systems, a nd any chemical treatment systems. The purpose of the assessment is to discover any vulner abilities that would allow for amplification of Legionella and to determine appropriate response actions in a dvance of any environmental sampling for Legionella . Initial and ongoing assessment should be conduct ed by a multidisciplinary team that represents the expertis e, knowledge, and functions related to the facility's operation and service. A team should in clude, at a minimum, representatives from the following groups: Infection Control, Physical Facil ities Management, Engineering, Clinicians, Laboratory, and Hospital Management. Costs: Costs to Private Regulated Parties: Building owners already incur costs for routine ope ration and maintenance of cooling towers. This regulation establishes the following new requirements: Routine Bacteriological Culture Testing - The regul ations require routine bacteriological testing pursuant to their cooling tower maintenance program and plan. The cost per dip 17 slide test is $3.50. Assuming that some plans may require tests be performed twice a week, this could result in an annual cost of $364. If heterotrophic plate count analysis is used the cost per sample on average is $25. Emergency Legionella Culture Testing - Owners of cooling towers are req uired to conduct additional testing for Legionella in the ev ent of disruption of normal operations or process control, or when indicated by epidemiolo gical evidence. The average cost of each sample analysis is estimated to be approximate ly $125.00. Maintenance Program and Plan Development - The form ulation of a cooling tower program and sampling plan would require 4 to 8 hour s at $150 per hour ($600 to $1200). The range represents the cost for reviewing and mod ifying an existing plan versus the preparation of a new plan. Inspection - Owners of cooling towers shall obtain the services of a professional engineer (P.E.), certified industrial hygienist (C.I.H.), ce rtified water technologist, or environmental consultant with training and experien ce performing inspections in accordance with current standard industry protocols including, but not limited to ASHRAE 18882015, for inspection of the cooling towe rs at intervals not exceeding 90 days while in use. The cost of such services is es timated to be approximately $150.00 per hour and estimated to take approximately eight (8) hours. Annual Certification - The same persons qualified t o perform inspections are qualified to perform annual certifications. The certification c an follow one of the required inspections and requires some additional evaluation and considerations. The cost of such services is estimated to be approximately $150.00 p er hour and is estimated to take approximately four (4) hours. 18 Emergency Cleaning and Disinfection - If emergency cleaning and disinfection is required, owners of cooling towers are required to obtain the services of a certified commercial pesticide applicator or pesticide techni cian who is qualified to apply biocide in a cooling tower, or a pesticide apprentice under the supervision of a certified applicator. The cost of such services is estimated to be approximately $5,000.00 for labor, plus the cost of materials. Recordkeeping and Electronic Reporting - Owners of cooling towers are required to maintain certain specified records and to electroni cally report certain specified information. The costs of these administrative act ivities are predicted to be minimal. Health Care Facilities - The cost of adopting a sam pling plan for Article 28 facilities is dependent upon any existing plan and the status of existing record keeping. It is estimated that with prior records and a maintenance plan the time required should a consultant be hired would be 6.5 hours at $150 per hour ($975). Without a prior plan and poor maintenance documentation the time required wo uld be 13 hours at $150 per hour ($1950). It is anticipated that facilities may dev elop the plan using existing staff. Costs to State Government and Local Government: State and local governments will incur costs for ad ministration, implementation, and enforcement. Exact costs cannot be predicted at th is time. However, some local costs may be offset through the collection of fees, fines and pe nalties authorized pursuant to this Part. Costs to State and local governments may be offset further b y a reduction in the need to respond to community legionellosis outbreaks. 19 Local Government Mandates: The SSC establishes a minimum standard for regulati on of health and sanitation. Local governments can, and often do, establish more restr ictive requirements that are consistent with the SSC through a local sanitary code. PHL \u00a7 228. Local governments have the power to enforce the provisions of the State Sanitary Code, including this new Part, utilizing both civil and criminal options available. PHL \u00a7\u00a7 228, 229, 309(1)(f) and 324(1)(e). Paperwork: The regulation imposes new registration, reporting and recordkeeping requirements for owners of cooling towers. Duplication: This regulation does not duplicate any state requi rements. Alternatives: The no action alternative was considered. Promulg ating this regulation was determined to be necessary to address this public health threa t. 20 Federal Standards: There are no federal standards or regulations perta ining to registration, maintenance, operation, testing, and inspection for cooling towe rs. Compliance Schedule: On August 17, 2015, when this regulation first bec ame effective, owners were given until September 16, 2015, to register their cooling tower s and perform bacteriological sampling. Now that the deadline has past, all owners should have registered their cooling towers, and any owners that have not registered their cooling towers must come into compliance immediately. All owners must register such towers prior to initial o peration. By March 1, 2016, all owners of existing cooling to wers must obtain and implement a maintenance program and plan. Until such plan is o btained, culture testing must be performed every 90 days, while the tower is in use. All owners must inspect their cooling towers at lea st every 90 days while in use. All owners of cooling towers shall obtain a certificati on that regulatory requirements have been met by November 1, 2016, with subsequent annual certifi cations by November 1 st of each year. Owners must register cooling towers and report cert ain actions, using a statewide electronic system. Reportable events include date of sample collections; date of cleaning and disinfection; start and end dates of any shutdown l asting more than five days; dates of last inspection and when due; dates of last certificatio n and when due; and date of discontinued use. These events must be reported to the statewide elec tronic system within 10 days of occurrence. 21 Contact Person: Katherine E.

This could include smal l businesses. At this time, it is not possible to determine the number of small businesses so affecte d. This regulation affects local governments by establishing requirements for implementing, admi nistering, and enforcing elements of this Part. Local governments have the power to enforce the provisions of the State Sanitary Code, including this new Part. PHL \u00a7\u00a7 228, 229, 309(1)(f) and 324(1)(e). Compliance Requirements: Small businesses that are also owners of cooling to wers must comply with all provisions of this Part. A violation of any provision of this Part is subject to all civil and criminal penaltie s as provided for by law. Each day that an owner rem ains in violation of any provision of this Part shall constitute a separate and distinct violation of such provision. Professional Services: To comply with inspection and certification require ments, small businesses will need to obtain services of a P.E., C.I.H., certified water technologist, or environmental consultant with training and experience performing inspections in a ccordance with current standard industry protocols including, but not limited to ASHRAE 1888 2015. Small businesses will need to secure laboratory services for routine culture sample test ing and, if certain events occur, emergency Legionella culture testing. 23 To comply with disinfection requirements, small bus inesses will need to obtain the services of a commercial pesticide applicator or pe sticide technician, or pesticide apprentice under supervision of a commercial pesticide applica tor. These qualifications are already required for the properly handling of biocides that destroy Legionella . Compliance Costs: Costs to Private Regulated Parties: Building owners already incur costs for routine ope ration and maintenance of cooling towers. This regulation establishes the following new requirements: Routine Bacteriological Culture Testing - The regul ations require routine bacteriological testing pursuant to industry standards. The cost per test is $3.50. Assuming tests are performed twice a week, this would result in an ann ual cost of $364. Emergency Legionella Culture Testing - Owners of cooling towers are req uired to conduct additional testing for Legionella in the ev ent of disruption of normal operations. The average cost of each sample analysis is estimat ed to be approximately $125.00. Inspection - Owners of cooling towers shall obtain the services of a professional engineer (P.E.), certified industrial hygienist (C.I.H.), ce rtified water technologist, or environmental consultant with training and experien ce performing inspections in accordance with current standard industry protocols including, but not limited to ASHRAE 18882015; for inspection of the cooling towe rs at intervals not exceeding once every 90 days while the cooling towers are in use. The cost of such services is estimated to be approximately $150.00 per hour and estimated to take approximately eight (8) 24 hours. Annual Certification - The same persons qualified t o perform inspections are qualified to perform annual certifications. The cost of such se rvices is estimated to be approximately $150.00 per hour and is estimated to take approxima tely four (4) hours. Emergency Cleaning and Disinfection - If emergency cleaning and disinfection is required, owners of cooling towers are required to obtain the services of a certified commercial pesticide applicator or pesticide techni cian who is qualified to apply biocide in a cooling tower, or a pesticide apprentice under the supervision of a certified applicator. The cost of such services is estimated to be approximately $5,000.00 for labor, plus the cost of materials. Recordkeeping and Electronic Reporting - Owners of cooling towers are required to maintain certain specified records and to electroni cally report certain specified information. The costs of these administrative act ivities are predicted to be minimal. The formulation of a cooling tower program and samp ling plan would require 4 to 8 hours at $150 per hour ($600 to $1200). The range represents the cost for reviewing and modifying an existing plan versus the preparation o f a new plan. Formulation of a sampling plan for Article 28 facil ities is dependent upon any existing plan and the status of existing record keeping. It is estimated that with prior records and a maintenance plan the time required should a consu ltant be hired would be 6.5 hours at $150 per hour ($975). Without a prior plan and poo r maintenance documentation the time required would be 13 hours at $150 per hour ($ 1950). It is anticipated that facilities may develop the plan using existing staff. 25 Costs to State Government and Local Government: State and local governments possess authority to en force compliance with these regulations. Exact costs cannot be predicted at th is time. However, some local costs may be offset through the collection of fees, fines and pe nalties authorized pursuant to this Part. Costs to State and local governments may be offset by a redu ction in the need to respond to community legionellosis outbreaks. Economic and Technological Feasibility: Although there will be an impact of building owners , including small businesses, compliance with the requirements of this regulation is considered economically and technologically feasible as it enhances and enforce s existing industry best practices. The benefits to public health are anticipated to outweigh any co sts. This regulation is necessary to protect public health. Minimizing Adverse Impact: The New York State Department of Health will assist local governments by providing a cooling tower registry and access to the database, technical consultation, coordination, and information and updates. Small Business and Local Government Participation: Development of this regulation has been coordinated with New York City. 26 Cure Period: Violation of this regulation can result in civil a nd criminal penalties. In light of the magnitude of the public health threat posed by the improper maintenance and testing of cooling towers, the risk that some small businesses will no t comply with regulations justifies the absence of a cure period. 27 Rural Area Flexibility Analysis Pursuant to Section 2028bb of the State Administrat ive Procedure Act (SAPA), a rural area flexibility analysis is not required. These provis ions apply uniformly throughout New York State, including all rural areas. The proposed rul e will not impose an adverse economic impact on rural areas, nor will it impose any disproportio nate reporting, record keeping or other compliance requirements on public or private entiti es in rural areas. 28 Job Impact Statement Nature of the Impact: The Department of Health expects there to be a posi tive impact on jobs or employment opportunities. The requirements in the regulation generally coincide with industry standards and manufacturers specification for the operation and m aintenance of cooling towers. However, it is expected that a subset of owners have not adequatel y followed industry standards and will now hire firms or individuals to assist them with compl iance and to perform inspections and certifications. Categories and Numbers Affected: The Department anticipates no negative impact on jo bs or employment opportunities as a result of the proposed regulations. Regions of Adverse Impact: The Department anticipates no negative impact on j obs or employments opportunities in any particular region of the state. Minimizing Adverse Impact: Not applicable. 29 Emergency Justification Improper maintenance of cooling towers can contribu te to the growth and dissemination of Legionella bacteria, the causative agent of legionellosis. L egionellosis causes cough, shortness of breath, high fever, muscle aches, head aches and can result in pneumonia. Hospitalization is often required, and between 5830 % of cases are fatal. People at highest risk are those 50 years of age or older, current or form er smokers, those with chronic lung diseases, those with weakened immune systems from diseases li ke cancer, diabetes, or kidney failure, and those who take drugs to suppress the immune system during chemotherapy or after an organ transplant. The number of cases of legionellosis re ported in New York State between 200582014 increased 323% when compared to those reported in t he previous ten year period. Outbreaks of legionellosis have been associated wit h cooling towers. A cooling tower is an evaporative device that is part of a recirculate d water system incorporated into a building's cooling, industrial process, refrigeration, or ener gy production system. Because water is part of the process of removing heat from a building, these devices require biocides\u2014chemicals that kill or inhibit bacteria (including Legionella )\u2014as means of controlling bacterial overgrowth. Overgrowth may result in the normal mists ejected f rom the tower having droplets containing Legionella . For example, in 2005, a cooling tower located at gr ound level adjacent to a hospital in New Rochelle, Westchester County resulted in a clus ter of 19 cases of legionellosis and multiple fatalities. Most of the individuals were dialysis patients or companions escorting the patients to their dialysis session. One fatality was in the lo cal neighborhood. The cooling tower was found to have insufficient chemical treatment. The entir e tower was ultimately replaced by the 30 manufacturer in order to maintain cooling for the h ospital and to protect public health. In June and July of 2008, 12 cases of legionellosis includi ng one fatality were attributed to a small evaporative condenser on Onondaga Hill in Syracuse, Onondaga County. An investigation found that the unit was not operating properly and this resulted in the growth of microorganisms in the unit. Emergency biocide treatment was initi ated and proper treatment was maintained. No new cases were then detected thereafter. Recent work has shown that sporadic cases of commun ity legionellosis are often associated with extended periods of wet weather wit h overcast skies. A study conducted by the New York State Department of Health that included d ata from 13 states and one United States municipality noted a dramatic increase in sporadic, community acquired legionellosis cases in May through August 2013. Large municipal sites suc h as Buffalo, Erie County reported 28 to 38 fold increases in cases without identifying common exposures normally associated with legionellosis. All sites in the study except one h ad a significant correlation, with some time lag, between legionellosis case onset and one or more we ather parameters. It was concluded that large municipalities produce significant mist (drop let) output from hundreds of cooling towers during the summer months. Periods of sustained pre cipitation, high humidity, cloud cover, and high dew point may lead to an \"urban cooling tower\" effect. The \"urban cooling tower\" effect is when a metropolitan area with hundreds of cooling t owers acts as one large cooling tower producing a large output of drift, which is entrapp ed by humid air and overcast skies. More recently, 133 cases of legionellosis, which in cluded 16 fatalities, occurred in Bronx, NY (July8September, 2015). This event was preceded by an outbreak in Co8Op City in the Bronx, from December 2014 to January 2015, which in volved 8 persons and no fatalities. Both of these outbreaks have been attributed to cooling towers, and emergency disinfection of 31 compromised towers helped curtail these outbreaks. These events highlight the need for proper maintenance of cooling towers. The heating, ventilation, and air8conditioning (HVA C) industry has issued guidelines on how to seasonally start a cooling tower; treat it w ith biocides and other chemicals needed to protect the components from scale and corrosion; an d set cycles of operations that determine when fresh water is needed; and how to shut down th e tower at the end of the cooling season. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air8Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) has recently released a new Standard entitled Legionellosis: Risk Management for Building Water Systems (ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 18882015). Section 7.2 of t hat document outlines components of the operations and management plan fo r cooling towers. The industry also relies on other guidance for specific treatment chemicals, emergency disinfection or decontamination procedures and other requirement. However, none of the guidance is obligatory. Conse quently, poor practice in operation and management can result in bacterial overgrowth, increases in legionellae, and mist emissions that contain a significant dose of pathogenic legio nellae. This regulation requires that all owners of cooling towers ensure proper maintenance of the cooling towers, to protect the public and address this public health threat. Further, these regulations require all general hosp itals and residential health care facilities (i.e., nursing homes) to develop a sampling plan, r eport the results, and take necessary actions to protect the safety of their patients or residents. The details of each facility's sampling plan and remedial measures will depend on the risk factors f or acquiring Legionnaires' disease in the 32 population served by the hospital or nursing home. Most people in nursing homes should be considered a t risk, as residents are typically over 50 years of age. In general hospitals, persons at risk include those over 50 years of age, as well as those receiving chemotherapy, those undergoing t ransplants, and other persons housed on healthcare units that require special precautions. Additional persons who might be at increased risk for acquiring Legionnaires' disease include pe rsons on high8dose steroid therapy and persons with chronic lung disease. Certain facilit ies with higher risk populations, such as those with hematopoietic stem8cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplant units, require more protective measures. An environmental assessment involves reviewing faci lity characteristics, hot and cold water supplies, cooling and air handling systems an d any chemical treatment systems. The purpose of the assessment is to discover any vulner abilities that would allow for amplification of Legionella spp. and to determine appropriate respon se actions in advance of any environmental sampling for Legionella. Initial and ongoing asses sment should be conducted by a multidisciplinary team that represents the expertis e, knowledge and functions related to the facility's operation and service. A team should in clude, at a minimum, representatives from the following Physical Facil ities Management; Engineering; Clinicians; Hospital Management. These regulations, which originally became effectiv e on August 17, 2015, implemented important requirements that protect the public from the threat posed by Legionella. To ensure that protection is maintained, the Commissioner of Health and the Public Health and Health 33 Planning Council have determined it necessary to fi le these regulations on an emergency basis. Public Health Law \u00a7 225, in conjunction with State Administrative Procedure Act \u00a7 202(6) empowers the Council and the Commissioner to adopt emergency regulations when necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety o r general welfare and that compliance with routine administrative procedures would be contrary to the public interest. SUMMARY OF EXPRESS TERMS The following summarizes the purpose and impact of each section. The summary is for convenience, and it is not a substitute for the exp ress terms of the regulation. 4E1.1 Scope. o Provides that the regulation applies to all owners of cooling towers. 4E1.2 Definitions. o This section defines key terms. o In particular, a \"cooling tower\" is now defined as: \"a cooling tower, evaporative condenser, fluid cooler or other wet cooling device that is capable of aerosolizing water, and that is part of, or contains, a recirculated wa ter system and is incorporated into a building's cooling process, an industrial process, a refrigeration system, or an energy production system.\" o The definition of \"owner\" is now defined as follows : \"any person, agent, firm, partnership, corporation or other legal entity havi ng a legal or equitable interest in, or control of, a cooling tower or the premises where t he cooling tower is located. In all instances, the legal owner of the building shall be deemed an owner within the meaning of the Subpart. Further, where a tenant owns a cool ing tower that services the tenant's leased premises, the tenant is an \"owner\" within th e meaning of this Subpart. Additionally, if a tenant does not own the cooling tower but has a lease or contractual arrangement to maintain the cooling tower, the tena nt shall be deemed an agent having control of the cooling tower, and thus an \"owner,\" for purposes of this Subpart.\" 4E1.3 Electronic registration and reporting. 2 o Requires owners of cooling towers to register such towers with the Department using a statewide electronic system. Required registrati on fields have been slightly revised. o Establishes a schedule for routine Legionella cultu re sampling and analysis, which includes reporting intervals not exceeding 90 days. o Requires reporting of certain events, including: /square4 last bacteriological culture sample collection date and result; /square4 last Legionella culture sample collection date and result; /square4 date of any required remedial date; /square4 last certification date; /square4 date of removal or permanent discontinued use of a cooling tower; and /square4 cooling tower system volume (including any piping, basin, and sump). o The proposed regulations generally require reportin g of certain events every 90 days. This is a change from the emergency regulations, wh ich required reporting within 10 days. o Affords public access to the statewide electronic s ystem, as appropriate, and requires such system to be accessible and searchable to loca l health departments. o Clarifies that where both a landlord and a tenant a re considered \"owners\" of a cooling tower pursuant to Section 4E1.2, then either the ow ner or the tenant shall register the cooling tower. Both parties, however, are obligated to ensure that registration and reporting are completed. 4E1.4 Maintenance program and plan. 3 o Requires owners to obtain or update the maintenance program and plan for all operational cooling towers by September 1, 2016, an d prior to the startup of newly installed cooling towers. The plan must include the following elements: /square4 A schedule for routine bacteriological culture samp ling and analysis to assess microbiological activity. The proposed regulation establishes a new, minimum sampling requirement, in which such samplin g and analysis must be conducted: (1) at intervals not to exceed 30 days w hile the cooling tower is in use; and (2) at additional times, as needed, to val idate process adjustments. The component that specifies a minimum sampling int erval is a new requirement. /square4 The emergency regulation contained a requirement fo r a schedule of routine Legionella culture sampling and analysis. The new regulation requires sampling within two weeks of seasonal startEup and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 90 days. In addition, the new regulation requires that yearEround use towers be sampled at intervals not to exceed 90 day s and within two weeks after startEup following maintenance. These are new requirements. /square4 Provisions for immediate Legionella culture sampling and analysis following specified conditions, such as power failure, loss o f biocide of sufficient duration to allow for the growth of bacteria, and i f the State or local health department determines that one or more cases of Legionella is or may be associated with the tower. In addition to the condi tions above, the proposed regulation describes conditions whereby the departm ent or local health department may require sampling. 4 /square4 Provisions requiring immediate and appropriate acti on, including any necessary remedial action, in response to bacteriol ogical and Legionella culture analyses. /square4 Provisions requiring that any and all Legionella culture analysis must be performed in accordance with Section 4E1.5. This is a new requirement. /square4 Provisions for shutdown and for removing or permane ntly discontinuing use of a cooling tower. These are new requirements. /square4 Provisions requiring appropriate actions during idl e conditions. This is a new requirement. /square4 Provisions requiring cleaning and disinfection of a cooling tower that has been shut down without treatment for more than five days . This is a new requirement. 4E1.5 Legionella culture analysis. o Requires that Legionella culture analysis be performed by a laboratory that is approved to perform such analysis by the New York S tate Environmental Laboratory Approval Program (ELAP). This is a new requirement. 4E1.6 Notification. o Requires an owner of a cooling tower to notify the local health department within 24 hours of receipt of a Legionella culture sample result that exceeds 1,000 Colony forming units (CFU) per milliliter. The owner must also notify the public of the test result in a manner determined by the local health d epartment or by the department, if the department elects to determine the manner of pu blic notification. This is a new requirement. 5 4E1.7 Disinfection. o Establishes qualifications of persons who may disin fect a cooling tower. o Requires that the name and certification number of the applicator or the business name and registration number of the company providi ng the disinfection be maintained onEsite in accordance with Section 4E1.9 . This is a new requirement. o Permits only biocide products registered by the New York State Department of Environmental Conversation to be used in disinfecti on. o \"Disinfection\" is clarified to exclude the cleanin g of a cooling tower through application of detergents, penetrants, brushes or o ther tools, highEpowered water, or any other method that does not involve the use of a pesticide, as defined in 6 NYCRR Part 325. 4E1.8 Inspection and certification. o Inspection. /square4 Requires that all owners of cooling towers ensure t hat such towers are inspected prior to seasonal start up and at interva ls not exceeding every 90 days while in use. YearEround towers shall be inspe cted at intervals not exceeding every 90 days and prior to start up follo wing maintenance. The inspection requirement prior to start up is new. o Certification. /square4 By November 1, 2016, and by November 1st of each ye ar thereafter, the owner of a cooling tower must obtain a certificatio n that the cooling tower has a maintenance program and plan, and that all activi ties within that plan or required by this Subpart were implemented. 6 o Reporting. /square4 All inspection findings, deficiencies, and correcti ve actions, and all certifications, must be reported to the owner. This section is new to the regulation. 4E1.9 Recordkeeping. o Describes the records and documentation that the ow ner must maintain onsite for at least three years. Such records must be made availa ble to the department or local health department upon request. 4E1.10 Enforcement. o Provides that the department or local health depart ment may require any owner to conduct Legionella culture sampling and analysis, following a determi nation, based upon epidemiologic or laboratory testing, that one or more cases of legionellosis are or may be associated with a cooling tower. This is a new provision. o Permits an officer or employee of the department or local health department to enter onto any property to inspect a cooling tower for co mpliance with the requirements of this Subpart. The proposed regulation clarifies tha t such officers or employees may take water samples. o Provides that a violation of any provision in this Subpart is subject to all civil and criminal penalties as provided for by law. Further, every day that an owner remains in violation of any provision constitutes a separate a nd distinct violation of such provision. 7 4E1.11 Variances and waivers. o Grants local health departments authority to issue variances from this regulation, upon approval of the New York State Department of H ealth. The local and State health department must be satisfied that the varian ce will not present a danger to public health. o The department may also grant general or specific w aivers where it is satisfied that a waiver will not present a danger to public health. 4E1.12 Severability. o Standard severability clause is included. Appendix 4EA o This Appendix describes required responsive actions for Legionella culture test results. As compared to the emergency regulations, these regulations raise the threshold level for detecting Legionella in laboratory culture analyses, from 10 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) to 2 0 CFU/mL. o Responsive actions have been updated and clarified. The term \"acceptable improvement\" was changed to an actual quantitative target of \"< 20 CFU/mL.\" Also, where an owner receives a laboratory Legionella culture analyses result 1000 CFU /mL, the owner must provide appropriate notificatio ns per section 4E1.6. o The footnotes for on-line decontamination and system decontamination were modified to allow the use of a halogenEbased compou nds (chlorine or bromine). 8 SUBPART 4E2 Covered Facilities 4E2.1 Scope. o This Subpart addresses Legionella exposure in general hospitals and residential health care facilities (collectively, \"covered faci lities\").

A qualified professional is a New Yor k State licensed professional engineer; certified industrial hygienist; certified water tec hnologist; environmental consultant or water treatment professional with training and experience performing assessments and sampling in accordance with current standard industry protocols . 32 SUMMARY OF REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT Needs and Benefits: Legionellosis describes any illness caused by expos ure to Legionella bacteria, including Legionnaire 's Disease and Pontiac Fever. Potential sources of e xposure to Legionella bacteria include water in the home, workplace, healthcare fa cilities or aerosolEproducing devices in public places. Improper maintenance of cooling towers can contribute to the growth and dissemination of Legionella bacteria. Inadequate surveillance for Legionella bacteria in the potable water systems at general hospitals and residential health care facilities can also increase the risk of legionellosis. Symptoms of legionellosis may include cough, shortn ess of breath, high fever, muscle aches, and headaches, and can result in pneumonia. Hospitalization is often required, and between 5 and 30% of cases are fatal. People at hig hest risk are those 50 years of age or older; current or former smokers; those with chronic lung diseases; those with weakened immune systems from diseases like cancer, diabetes, or kid ney failure; and those who take drugs to suppress the immune system during chemotherapy or a fter an organ transplant. The number of cases of legionellosis reported in New York State b etween 2005 and 2014 increased 323%, compared to those reported in the previous tenEyear period. Outbreaks of legionellosis have been associated wit h cooling towers, as well as with the potable water systems of general hospitals and resi dential health care facilities. Subpart 4E1 of these regulations establish requirements for coolin g towers relating to: registration, reporting and recordkeeping; maintenance; inspection; and certification of compliance. Subpart 4E2 of these regulations require general ho spitals and residential health care facilities to 33 implement an environmental assessment and Legionella sampling plan for their potable water systems and take necessary responsive actions. These proposed regulations incorporate important cl arifications and revisions from the emergency regulations initially adopted by the Publ ic Health and Health Planning Council on August 17, 2015. In general, the Department organiz ed and streamlined the language for concision and clarity. Certain sections were renumb ered and related provisions consolidated. Further, the proposed regulations have been divided into two Subparts. Costs: Subpart 4-1 Building owners already incur costs for routine ope ration and maintenance of cooling towers. There will be some increased costs associat ed with sampling, inspection, and certification of cooling towers. These costs are de tailed in the Regulatory Impact Statement. State and local governments will incur costs for ad ministration, implementation, and enforcement. Exact costs cannot be predicted at thi s time. However, some local costs may be offset through the collection of fees, fines and pe nalties authorized pursuant to this Part. Costs to State and local governments may be offset further b y a reduction in the need to respond to community legionellosis outbreaks. Subpart 4-2 General hospitals and residential healthcare facili ties already incur costs associated with running infection control programs. The regulations would incur new costs for those facilities that are not already conducting annual environmenta l assessments, and would require all such facilities to adopt and implement a Legionella sampling plan. In many instances, facilities can 34 complete the environmental assessment using existin g hospital staff (maintenance, operations, and nursing staff). The cost of these requirements is expected to be offset by the reduced risk of Legionellosis in such facilities. Contact Person: Katherine E. Ceroalo New York State Department of Health Bureau of House Counsel, Regulatory Affairs Unit Corning Tower Building, Room 2438 Empire State Plaza Albany, New York 12237 (518) 473E7488 (518) 473E2019 (FAX) REGSQNA@health.ny.gov 35 Regulatory Impact Statement Statutory Authority: The Public Health and Health Planning Council (PHH PC) is authorized by Section 225 of the Public Health Law (PHL) to establish, amend and repeal sanitary regulations to be known as the State Sanitary Code (SSC), subject to the appro val of the Commissioner of Health. PHL Section 225(5)(a) provides that the SSC may deal wi th any matter affecting the security of life or health, or the preservation or improvement of publi c health, in the state of New York. Legislative Objectives: This rulemaking is in accordance with the legislat ive objective of PHL Section 225 authorizing PHHPC, in conjunction with the Commissi oner of Health, to protect public health and safety by amending the SSC to address issues th at jeopardize such health and safety. Subpart 4E1 establishes requirements for cooling to wers reporting and recordkeeping; of compliance. Subpart 4E2 establishes requirements for potable wa ter systems for general hospitals and residential health care facilities. Needs and Benefits: Legionellosis describes any illness caused by expo sure to Legionella bacteria, including Legionnaire's Disease and Pontiac Fever. Symptoms o f legionellosis may include cough, shortness of breath, high fever, muscle aches, and headaches, and can result in pneumonia. People at highest risk are those 50 years of age or older; current or former smokers; those with chronic lung diseases; those with weakened immune s ystems from diseases like cancer, diabetes, 36 or kidney failure; and those who take drugs to supp ress the immune system during chemotherapy or after an organ transplant. The number of cases o f legionellosis reported in New York State between 2005 and 2014 increased 323%, compared to t hose reported in the previous tenEyear period. Illnesses caused by the Legionella bacteria are a serious public health threat, as th ese cases often require hospitalization, and between 5 and 30% of cases are fatal. Optimal conditions for Legionella growth include warm water that is high in nutrient s and protected from light. People are exposed to Legionella through inhalation of aerosolized water containing the bacteria. Outbreaks of legionellosis have been asso ciated with cooling towers, as well as with the potable water systems of hospitals and residential health care facilities. The proposed regulations govern operation and maint enance of cooling towers, as well as potable water systems for general hospitals and res idential healthcare facilities. These proposed regulations incorporate important clarifications an d revisions, as compared to the emergency regulations adopted by PHHPC on August 17, 2015. In general, the Department has organized and streamlined the language for concision and clar ity. Certain sections were renumbered and related provisions consolidated. Further, the prop osed regulations have been divided into two Subparts: the first regulates cooling towers, and t he second regulates potable water systems of general hospitals and residential health care facil ities. Subpart 4-1 Improper maintenance of cooling towers can contribu te to the occurrence of Legionella . A cooling tower is an evaporative device that is pa rt of a recirculated water system incorporated into a building's cooling, industrial process, refr igeration, or energy production system. Water is part of the process of heat transfer, and these dev ices require disinfectant to kill or inhibit the 37 growth of bacteria (including Legionella ) in such water. The mists normally aerosolized fro m the tower contain any bacteria growing in this water, i ncluding Legionella . Notably, cooling tower manuals typically contain wa rnings that Legionella and other bacteria may be amplified and disseminated if the c ooling tower is not properly maintained. Manuals typically recommend that the cooling tower be located at a distance and direction that avoids contaminated discharge from being drawn into fresh air intakes. In 2005, a cooling tower located at ground level ad jacent to a hospital in New Rochelle, Westchester County resulted in a cluster of 19 case s of legionellosis and multiple fatalities. Most of the individuals were either dialysis patients, o r companions escorting patients to their dialysis session. The cooling tower was found to have insuff icient chemical treatment to control bacterial overgrowth. The tower was ultimately replaced by th e manufacturer in order to maintain cooling for the hospital and to protect public health. Additionally, in June and July of 2008, 12 cases of legionellosis, including one fatality, were attributed to a small cooling tower in Syracus e, New York. After an investigation, it was determined that the unit was not operating properly , resulting in the growth of microorganisms in the unit. No new cases were detected after emergenc y biocide treatment was initiated and proper treatment was maintained. Recently, 133 cases of legionellosis, which include d 16 fatalities, occurred in the Bronx, New York (JulyEAugust, 2015). Epidemiologic, enviro nmental, and laboratory investigations of the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in the South Bro nx identified a hotel cooling tower as the source of this outbreak. The investigation included a DNA comparison of isolates cultured from cooling towers in the South Bronx and caseEpatients who lived, worked or visited the area. DNA 38 from the hotel cooling tower isolates and the outbr eakEassociated cases were indistinguishable. In both situations, emergency disinfection of compr omised cooling towers helped curtail these outbreaks. These outbreaks highlight the need for proper operation, monitoring, onEgoing treatment and maintenance of cooling towers. Prior to the issuance of the emergency regulation in August 2015, cooling towers were unregulated in New York State. The heating, ventilation, and airEconditioning (HVA C) industry has issued guidelines on how to: seasonally start a cooling tower; treat it with biocides and other chemicals needed to protect the components from scale and corrosion; se t cycles of operations that determine when fresh water is needed; and shut down the tower at t he end of the cooling season. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and AirECondition ing Engineers (ASHRAE) has recently released a new Standard entitled Legionellosis: Risk Management for Building Water S ystems (ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 188E2015). Section 7.2 of tha t document outlines components of the operations and management plan for cooling towers. The industry also relies on other guidance for specific treatment chemicals, emergency disinfe ction or decontamination procedures, and other requirements. Absent regulation, however, this industry guidance is not obligatory. Consequently, maintenance deficiencies, such as poor practice in operation and management, can result in bacterial overgrowth and mist emissions that contai n pathogenic Legionella bacteria. This regulation requires that all owners of cooling towe rs ensure that such towers are properly maintained, to protect the public and address this public health threat. Subpart 4-2 39 The proposed regulations require that all general h ospitals and residential healthcare facilities perform an environmental assessment of t heir facility. The facilities must also adopt a Legionella sampling plan for their potable water system, repo rt the results, and take necessary actions to protect the safety of their patients and /or residents. Additionally, facilities must perform immediate Legionella culture sampling and analysis of potable water sys tems, in a manner directed by the Department, where the Depart ment determines that one or more cases of legionellosis are, or may be, associated with the f acility. The Department may also require immediate sampling and analysis based upon any othe r conditions it specifies. Most healthy people do not get Legionnaires' diseas e after being exposed to Legionella . In both general hospitals and nursing homes, the ri sk for disease increases in people who are: over 50 years of age; receiving chemotherapy; under going or who have undergone transplants; or receiving immunosuppressive therapy for other condi tions. Hospitals will often group these patients together due to the requirements for speci al precautions. General hospitals who have patients within hematopoietic stemEcell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplant units are especially at risk. Accordingly, the potable water systems serving such patients require more frequent sampling under the regulations. Additionally, people with chronic lung disease are at increased risk for acquiring Legionnaires' disease. Many residents of nursing ho mes are at risk for legionellosis, as the risk increases with increasing age, especially in the pr esence of underlying chronic disease. From 2007 to date, the Department has been involved with the environmental assessment or investigation of 230 Legionellosis events that i nvolved one or more cases, located in 173 hospitals and nursing homes. These cases have demon strated the need for general hospitals and 40 nursing homes to conduct regular environmental asse ssments, implement a sampling plan for the potable water systems, and to take necessary respon sive action. Costs: Costs to Private Regulated Parties: Subpart 4-1 Building owners already incur costs for routine ope ration and maintenance of cooling towers. The proposed regulation, however, establis hes certain requirements that have associated costs, to the extent these actions are not already being performed. Routine Bacteriological Culture Sampling and Analys is. The regulations require routine bacteriological sampling and analysis using dip sli des or heterotrophic plate counts (HPC). o The cost per dipEslide test is $3.50. Assuming thes e tests are performed once each month, this would result in an annual cost of $42 f or yearEround towers. For seasonal towers, the approximate cost for this samp ling is $24.50. o The cost per HPC test would average $20. Assuming HPC is performed once each month, this would result in an annual cost of $240 for yearEround cooling towers. For seasonal towers, the approximate cost would be $140. Routine and Immediate Legionella Culture Sampling a nd Analysis. Owners of cooling towers are required to conduct Legionella culture sampling and analysis at intervals not to exceed every 90 days while the cooling tower is in use, and immediately in the event of disruption of normal operations. The average cos t of each sample analysis is estimated to be approximately $125. If four samples are coll ected per year for a yearEround cooling tower, the approximate cost is $500. In the case of a seasonal tower, if three samples are 41 collected per year, the approximate annual cost is $375. Inspection. Owners of cooling towers shall obtain the services of a professional engineer (P.E.), certified industrial hygienist (C.I.H.), ce rtified water technologist, or environmental consultant or water treatment profess ional with training and experience performing inspections in accordance with current s tandard industry protocols including, but not limited to ASHRAE 188E2015; for inspection of the cooling towers at intervals not exceeding once every 90 days while the cooling towers are in use. The cost of such services is estimated to be approximately $150 per hour and estimated to take approximately eight (8) hours. For yearEround tower s, the approximate annual cost of inspection is $4,800, and for seasonal towers, the approximate annual cost of inspection is $3,600. Annual Certification. The same persons qualified to perform inspections a re qualified to perform annual certifications. The cost of such ser vices is estimated to be approximately $150 per hour and is estimated to take approximatel y four (4) hours. The approximate cost of annual certification for both yearEround an d seasonal towers is $600. Disinfection. If disinfection is required, owners of cooling to wers are required to obtain the services of a certified commercial pesticide ap plicator or pesticide technician who is qualified to apply biocide in a cooling tower, or a pesticide apprentice under the supervision of a certified applicator. The cost of such services is estimated to be approximately $5,000 for labor, plus the cost of ma terials. Recordkeeping and Electronic Reporting. Owners of cooling towers are required to maintain certain specified records and to electroni cally report certain specified information. The costs of these administrative acti vities are predicted to be minimal. 42 The formulation of a cooling tower maintenance prog ram and plan is estimated to require 4 to 8 hours at $150 per hour ($600 to $1200). The range represents the cost for reviewing and modifying an existing plan versus the preparation of a new plan. Where power producers and industrial facilities dis infect a cooling tower using halogenation, they may be required to dehalogenate discharge streams from cooling towers to meet State Pollutant Discharge Eliminatio n permit System (SPDES) permit conditions. Piping, and attendant monitoring equip ment (e.g., conductivity probes, continuous halogen monitors), may require design an d capital expenditures in accordance with the unique operating conditions of the tower. Subpart 4-2 General hospitals and residential healthcare facili ties already incur costs for routine operation and maintenance of infection control prog rams. This regulation establishes the following requirements, which have associated costs : Annual Environmental Assessment. In many instances, physical facilities staff can complete the environmental assessment in cooperatio n with other hospital staff (maintenance, operations, and nursing staff). The w ork can normally be completed in 2 to 3 hours. In the event that a consultant is used, th ese costs range between $300 and $450. Sampling Plan. If the facility already has a sampling plan and ma intains proper maintenance records, but requires a consultant to d etermine compliance with these new requirements, the associated cost would be 6.5 hour s at $150 per hour ($975). Without a prior plan, and with poor maintenance documentation , the associated cost would be 13 hours, or more, at $150 per hour (approximately $1, 950). In some cases, facilities may be 43 able to develop a sampling plan using existing staf f. Further, these costs will have already been realized by those facilities following the dep artment's guidance documents issued prior to the emergency regulations. Routine and Immediate Legionella Culture Sampling a nd Analysis. Covered facilities are expected to sample at intervals not to exceed every 90 days for the first year after adoption of the sampling plan. If ten samples were to be collected during each sampling round, and the cost of each sample analysis is esti mated to be approximately $125.00, the total cost per year of such sampling is estimated t o be $5,000. This would be an annual cost for facilities with hematopoietic stemEcell tr ansplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplant units. For facilities without such units , the annual cost of sampling is estimated to be $1,250, as sampling may be performed on an an nual basis. Costs to State Government and Local Government: State and local governments will incur costs for ad ministration, implementation, and enforcement of Subpart 4E1. Exact costs cannot be p redicted at this time. However, some local costs may be offset through the collection of fees, fines and penalties authorized pursuant to this Part. Costs to State and local governments may be o ffset further by a reduction in the need to respond to community legionellosis outbreaks. State government will incur costs for enforcement o f Subpart 4E2 for general hospitals and residential healthcare facilities. However, the cost is expected to be outweighed by the benefit of reduced cases of legionellosis at these facilities. 44 Local Government Mandates: The SSC establishes a minimum standard for regulati on of health and sanitation. Local governments can, and often do, establish more restr ictive requirements that are consistent with the SSC through a local sanitary code. PHL \u00a7 228. L ocal governments have the power to enforce the provisions of the State Sanitary Code, includin g Subpart 4E1, utilizing both civil and criminal options available. PHL \u00a7\u00a7 228, 229, 309(1)(f) and 3 24(1)(e). With respect to Subpart 4E2, the Department, rather than local governments, will con duct enforcement. Paperwork: The regulation imposes new registration, reporting and recordkeeping requirements for owners of cooling towers. Additionally, general hos pitals and residential healthcare facilities will be required to perform periodic environmental asses sments and to adopt and implement a Legionella sampling plan. The regulation imposes new recordke eping requirements for general hospitals and residential healthcare facilities rel ated to the environmental assessment, the sampling plan and sample results. Duplication: This regulation does not duplicate any state requi rements. Alternatives: No alternatives were considered, as promulgating t his regulation was determined to be necessary to address the public health threat. 45 Federal Standards: There are no federal standards or regulations perta ining to registration, maintenance, operation, testing, and inspection for cooling towe rs, or to Legionella sampling of potable water systems for general hospitals or residential health care facilities. Compliance Schedule: These permanent regulations, which incorporate revi sions to the emergency regulations currently in effect, will be effective upon publica tion of a Notice of Adoption in the State Register. Subpart 4-1 All owners of existing cooling towers should alrea dy be complying with the current emergency regulations. By September 1, 2016, all o wners of existing cooling towers must begin routine bacteriological sampling analysis every 30 days while the tower is in use, and Legionella culture sampling and analysis every 90 days while t he tower is in use. As in the emergency regulations, owners of cooling towers must obtain a certification that regulatory requirements have been met by November 1, 2016, with subsequent annual certifications by November 1 st of each year. Owners must register cooling towers and report cert ain actions, using a statewide electronic system. Reportable events include dates of sample collection; dates of disinfection; date of last inspection; date of last certification ; and date of discontinued use. Reporting must be made through the electronic registry in intervals n ot exceeding 90 days. 46 Subpart 4-2 By September 1, 2016, all covered facilities must p erform an environmental assessment of the facility using forms provided, or approved, by the department, unless an environmental assessment was performed on or after September 1, 2 015. The assessment shall be updated annually and updated in the event of a case of faci lityEacquired legionellosis, facility repair, new construction, changes in the potable water system, and upon any other conditions specified by the department. Additionally, all covered facilities must adopt and implement a Legionella sampling plan for the facilities' potable water system by Decembe r 1, 2016. The plan must include Legionella culture sampling and analysis at intervals not to e xceed 90 days for the first year after the adoption of the sampling plan. Thereafter, sampling is to be performed annually, at a minimum, provided that general hospitals with hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplant units must continue to sample at intervals not to exceed 90 days. The sampling plan must be reviewed annually and updated in the event of a case of faci lityEacquired legionellosis, significant construction, repair work, or changes to the potabl e water system and/or facilities' use that may affect hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ tran splant units, and any other conditions specified by the department. In addition to the sampling required by a facility' s sampling plan, immediate Legionella culture sampling and analysis of the potable water system must occur, at the direction of the department, when (1) a determination is made by the department that one or more cases of legionellosis are, or may be, associated with the f acility; or (2) any other conditions specified by the department. 47 Contact Person: Katherine E.

Any general hospitals and residential health care facil ities owned or operated by a local government or that qualifies as a small business will be requi red to complete an environmental assessment, adopt and implement a Legionella sampling plan for the facilities ' potable water system, and take appropriate responsive actions. At this time, it is not possible to determine the number of small businesses or local governments affected. Local governments must also enforce Subpart 4E1, re lating to regulation of cooling towers. Local governments have the power to enforc e the provisions of the State Sanitary Code, including this new Part. PHL \u00a7\u00a7 228, 229, 309(1)(f ) and 324(1)(e). Compliance Requirements: Compliance requirement for small businesses and loc al governments are the same as those requirements set forth in the Regulatory Impa ct Statement. Professional Services: To comply with inspection and certification require ments with respect to cooling towers, small businesses and local governments will need to obtain services of a P.E., C.I.H., certified water technologist, or environmental consultant wit h training and experience performing 49 inspections in accordance with current standard ind ustry protocols including, but not limited to ASHRAE 188E2015. Small businesses and local governm ents will need to secure laboratory services for Legionella culture analysis. To comply with disinfection requ irements with respect to cooling towers, small businesses and local gover nments will need to obtain the services of a commercial pesticide applicator or pesticide techni cian, or pesticide apprentice under supervision of a commercial pesticide applicator. Compliance with the provisions that apply to genera l hospitals and healthcare facilities may require expertise in areas such engineering, ph ysical facility management, water treatment methods, and monitoring of the environmental condit ions of their potable water distribution systems. Compliance Costs: Compliance costs for small business and local gover nment are consistent with the costs outlined in the Regulatory Impact Statement. Economic and Technological Feasibility: Although there will be an impact on building owners , including small businesses and local governments, compliance with the regulation i s considered economically and technologically feasible, in part because the requi rements are consistent industry best practices. This regulation is also necessary to protect public health, and it is expected to reduce cases of legionellosis in communities around cooling towers, as well as for patients and residents in general hospitals and residential healthcare facili ties. Accordingly, the benefits to public health are anticipated to outweigh any costs. 50 Minimizing Adverse Impact: The Department provides a cooling tower registry, t echnical consultation, coordination, and information and updates. In addition, the Depa rtment has issued guidance for general hospitals and cooling towers, which is consistent w ith the proposed regulations. Covered facilities that have followed the guidance will alr eady be in compliance with most of the new regulations. Small Business and Local Government Participation: Development of the emergency regulations, upon whic h these regulations were based, was coordinated with New York City. Cure Period: Violation of this regulation can result in civil a nd criminal penalties. However, the regulations allow for time to adopt plans and perfo rmed required actions. Accordingly, and in light of the magnitude of the public health threat posed by Legionella , no cure period is warranted. 51 RURAL AREA FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS Pursuant to Section 202Ebb of the State Administra tive Procedure Act (SAPA), a rural area flexibility analysis is not required. These p rovisions apply uniformly throughout New York State, including all rural areas. The proposed rul e will not impose an adverse economic impact on rural areas, nor will it impose any disproportio nate reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements on public or private entiti es in rural areas. 52 JOB IMPACT STATEMENT Nature of the Impact: The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) ex pects there to be a positive impact on jobs or employment opportunities. The re quirements in the regulation generally coincide with industry standards and manufacturers specification for the operation and maintenance of cooling towers. However, it is expe cted that a subset of owners have not adequately followed industry standards and will hir e firms or individuals to assist them with compliance and to perform inspections and certifica tions. Categories and Numbers Affected: The Department anticipates no negative impact on jo bs or employment opportunities as a result of the proposed regulations. Regions of Adverse Impact: The Department anticipates no negative impact on j obs or employment opportunities in any particular region of the state. Minimizing Adverse Impact: Not applicable. Pursuant to the authority vested in the Public Heal th and Health Planning Council and the Commissioner of Health by Sections 2800 and 2803 of the Public Health Law, Part 405 of Title 10 (Health) of the Official Compilation of Codes, R ules and Regulations of the State of New York is amended, to be effective upon publication i n the New York State Register, to read as follows: A new section 405.33 is added as follows: 405.33 Screening mammography services (a) Applicability. This section shall apply to any general hospital o r extension clinic that is certified as a mammography facility pursuant to the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA). (b) Extended service hours. Any general hospital or extension clinic certified as a mammography facility pursuant to the MQSA shall provide extended hours, i.e. in the earl y morning, evening, or weekend hours, for screening mammography services. Extended hours for screening mammography services shall be provided on at least two days each week, for at lea st two hours each day offered, for a total of at least four hours each week, including but not limit ed to the following times: (1) Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7:00 a. m. and 9:00 a.m.; (2) Monday through Friday, between the hours of 5:00 p. m. and 7:00 p.m.; or (3) Saturday or Sunday, between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. 2 (c) Waiver. (1) A facility may submit an application for a waiver f rom the requirements of this section, in whole or in part, if it can demonstrate, to the Dep artment's satisfaction, that the facility: (i) does not have sufficient staff to provide extended hours for screening mammography services in accordance with this sectio n, and that it is making diligent efforts to obtain staffing such that it ca n provide extended hours; (ii) is in the process of discontinuing screening mammog raphy services, as part of a consolidation or similar change; or (iii) is subject to such other hardships as the Dep artment deems appropriate. (2) The Department may deny, grant or extend a waiver f or 90 days, or more if the Department determines appropriate, in its sole disc retion. 3 REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT Statutory Authority: Public Health Law (\"PHL\") Section 2800 provides tha t \"hospital and related services including health-related service of the highest qua lity, efficiently provided and properly utilized at a reasonable cost, are of vital concern to the p ublic health. In order to provide for the protection and promotion of the health of the inhab itants of the state . . ., the department of health shall have the central, comprehensive responsibilit y for the development and administration of the state's policy with respect to hospital related services . . .\" PHL Section 2803 authorizes the Public Health and H ealth Planning Council (\"PHHPC\") to adopt rules and regulations to implement the pur poses and provisions of PHL Article 28, and to establish minimum standards governing the operat ion of health care facilities. Legislative Objectives: The legislative objectives of PHL Article 28 includ e the protection of the health of the residents of the State, by promoting the availabili ty of high quality health services at a reasonable cost. Needs and Benefits: In 2014, nearly 22% of women in New York State (NYS ) aged 50-74 reported not receiving mammograms at least every other year. Br east cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of ca ncer death among women in New York State. Each year, approximately 15,000 women in Ne w York State are newly diagnosed with 4 breast cancer, and approximately 2,640 die from the disease. Some subpopulations who are less likely to have been screened include women without health insurance (61.7% screened) and women without a regular health care provider (63.0% screened). Screening for breast cancer can increase the likelihood of identifying cancer at an early stage, when treatment is most successful. Once screened, follow-up diagnostic testing is crit ical to ensuring women receive necessary, potentially life-saving treatment. Women may not get screened because they are afraid that mammography may be painful, they do not know what screening guidelines are, the y do not know where to go for screening, they may have transportation barriers, or they may think screening is unaffordable. When women need follow-up testing and treatment, they ca n be overwhelmed. They may need help with accessing services, navigating complex health systems, and managing treatment decisions. The Community Preventive Services Task Force, an in dependent panel of experts appointed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ), has recommended reducing structural barriers as an intervention to improve breast cance r screening. Reducing structural barriers includes modifying hours of service to meet client needs. There are approximately 600 certified mammography f acilities in New York State: 210 are hospital-based (152 hospital locations, plus 58 hospital extension clinic sites); 18 free- standing diagnostic and treatment center; and 372 o ther non-hospital based mammography facilities. A survey of 36 contractors in the Canc er Services Program, which provides cancer screening for the uninsured, found that the majorit y (95%) had at least one mammography provider (either hospital or nonhospital based) tha t offered extended hours. A recent review of 5 160 of 210 hospital-based mammography facilities in NYS found that 70% offer one or a combination of alternative hours of services (early morning, evening, or weekend), and 30% do not. Costs: Costs to the State Government: The proposed rule does not impose any new costs on state government. Costs to Local Government: The proposed rule does not impose any new costs on local governments, with the exception of four general hospitals that are operat ed by local governments. The cost to local governments that operate general hospitals are the same as the costs to private regulated parties, as described below. Costs to Private Regulated Parties: Both the Affordable Care Act and the NYS Insurance Law require insurers to cover mammography. Facilities already obtain third-party payment for mammograms through Medicaid and other insurers, thereby reducing the c ost to regulated parties. Further, these proposed rules are not expected to impose any addit ional costs on those hospitals and diagnostic and treatment centers that are already in complianc e, and the 70% of hospital-based facilities that already offer some form of extended hours. The primary cost for those facilities that will be required to extend or change their hours for screening mammography services, assuming they a re not already offering such hours, is the cost of ensuring staff, such as technicians, radiol ogists, and intake and support staff, are available 6 to satisfy the extended hour requirement. The Depa rtment expects that most hospitals and hospital extension clinics that currently offer ext ended hours can modify the work hours of existing staff or use flex time to avoid incurring additional staff costs. Those facilities that need to modify their appointment hours to comply with th ese regulations may be able to use similar scheduling strategies to avoid incurring any new co sts. Costs to the Regulatory Agency: The proposed rule does not impose any new costs on any regulatory agency. Local Government Mandates: The four general hospitals that are operated by loc al governments will be required to comply with this regulations, as discussed above. Paperwork: The proposed rule imposes no new reporting requirem ents, forms, or other paperwork upon regulated parties. Duplication: There are no relevant rules or other legal requirem ents of the Federal or State governments that duplicate, overlap, or conflict wi th this rule. 7 Alternatives: There were no significant alternatives to be consid ered during the regulatory process. The serious risk that breast cancer presents justif ies requiring extended hours for screening mammography services. Federal Standards The proposed rule does not exceed any minimum stand ards of the federal government for the same or similar subject area. Although the Mamm ography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) governs certain aspects of mammography services, it does not govern the hours at which such services must be available. Compliance Schedule: The proposal will go into effect upon publication o f the Notice of Adoption in the New York State Register .

Of these, there are four hospitals run by a local government (county) and on e hospital that qualifies as a small business. Facilities that are small businesses or operated by local governments will not be affected differently from other facilities. Compliance Requirements: Compliance requirements are applicable to the one h ospital considered a small business as well as the four hospitals operated by local gov ernments. Compliance requires providing extended hours for screening mammography services. Professional Services: As noted in the Regulatory Impact Statement, this r egulation will require additional staffing or staffing adjustment to ensure that scre ening mammography services are available at the required hours. Compliance Costs: Compliance costs for small businesses and local gov ernments would be the same as those described in the Regulatory Impact Statement. 9 Economic and Technological Feasibility: It is economically and technologically feasible for facilities that are small businesses or operated by local governments to comply with this a mended rule. Minimizing Adverse Impact: Approximately 70% of hospital-based mammography fac ilities already offer some form of extended hours. By adopting a regulatory standar d for which this is already a significant level of compliance, the Department has minimized the imp act on regulated facilities. Additionally, the regulation includes a waiver provision for thos e facilities that can demonstrate hardship. Small Business and Local Government Participation: A copy of this notice of proposed rulemaking will b e posted on the Department's website. The notice will invite public comments on the proposal and include instructions for anyone interested in submitting comments, including small businesses and local governments. Cure Period: Chapter 524 of the Laws of 2011 requires agencies t o include a \"cure period\" or other opportunity for ameliorative action to prevent the imposition of penalties on the party or parties subject to enforcement when developing a regulation or explain in the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis why one was not included. This regulation creates no new penalty or sanction. Hence, a cure period is not required. 10 RURAL AREA FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS Types and Estimated Numbers of Rural Areas: The proposed rule will apply to the 152 hospitals a nd 58 hospital extension clinics providing screening mammography services in New Yor k State. The Department identified 57 hospitals and 13 hospital extension clinics providi ng mammography facilities located in rural areas of the State, defined as counties with less t han a population of 200,000. A review of the hospital screening mammography services determined that 67% already offer some form of extended hours. Since this percentage is similar t o the statewide percentage of approximately 70% of facilities already offering some form extend ed hours, this proposed rule is not expected to have a disproportionate impact on rural areas. Reporting, Recordkeeping, Other Compliance Requirem ents and Professional Services: This regulation will require additional staffing or staffing adjustment to ensure that extended screening mammography services are availab le. Costs: Compliance costs for entities in rural areas would be the same as those described in the Regulatory Impact Statement. Minimizing Adverse Impact: Approximately 67% of facilities in rural areas are already offering some form of extended hours. By adopting a regulatory standard f or which this is already a significant level of 11 compliance, the Department has minimized the impact on facilities. Additionally, the regulation includes a waiver provision for those facilities th at can demonstrate hardship. Rural Area Participation: A copy of this notice of proposed rulemaking will b e posted on the Department's website. The notice will invite public comments on the proposal and include instructions for anyone interested in submitting comments, including those from rural areas. 12 JOB IMPACT STATEMENT No Job Impact Statement is included because the Dep artment has concluded that the proposed regulatory amendments will not have a subs tantial adverse effect on jobs and employment opportunities. The basis for this concl usion is that requiring extended hours for screening mammography services does not reduce empl oyment opportunities, and may create employment opportunities. SUMMARY OF EXPRESS TERMS This rule amends Sections 700.2 and Parts 717 and r epeals and replaces Part 793 and 794 of Title 10 (Health) of NYCRR, the operational rule s for hospices approved to provide services in New York State under Article 40 of the Public Health Law.

(2) The hospice plan of care should reflect the par ticipation of the hospice, the facility staff, and the patient and family to the extent pos sible. (3) Based on collaboration between the hospice and the facility, the hospice plan of care should reflect: (i) a common problem list; (ii) palliative interventions; (iii) palliative outcomes; (iv) responsible discipline; 63 (v) responsible provider; and (vi) patient goals. (4) The hospice must approve any changes in the hos pice plan of care before implementation and discuss such changes with the pa tient or representative, and facility representatives. (d) For each patient, the hospice must designate a member of the interdisciplinary group who will be responsible for: (1) providing overall coordination of the hospice c are of the resident with the facility representatives and communicating with facility rep resentatives and other health care providers and physicians participating in the provi sion of care; (2) providing the facility, for each hospice patien t, with: (i) the most recent hospice plan of care; (ii) the hospice election form and any advance dire ctives; (iii) the physician certification and recertificati on of the terminal illness; (iv) the names and contact information for hospice personnel involved in hospice care; (v) hospice medication information; (vi) hospice physician and attending physician (if any) orders; and (vii) instructions on how to access the hospice's 2 4-hour on-call system; (e) Hospice staff must orient facility staff care to hospice patients to the hospice philosophy; hospice policies and procedures regarding methods of comfort, pain control, and symptom management; principles about d eath and dying and individual responses to death; patient rights; appropriate for ms; and record keeping requirements. 64 Section 794.9 Records and reports. (a) The governin g authority shall ensure that: (1) the following records are retained on file at t he principal office of the hospice within its approved geographic service area and available to the Department upon request: (i) the certificate of incorporation, if applicable ; (ii) the certificate of approval; (iii) all current contracts, leases and other agree ments entered into by the hospice; (iv) current operating policies and procedures; and (v) a current patient/family roster; (2) copies of the documents under subparagraphs (1) (iv) and (v) of this subdivision are retained on file at each suboffice of the hospice, if applicable; (3) the following reports and records are retained by the hospice and available to the department upon request: (i) minutes of the meetings of the hospice governin g authority and the quality assurance committee which shall be retained for three years f rom the date of the meeting; (ii) the reports of hospice surveys and inspections by outside agencies with statements attached thereto specifying the steps taken to corr ect any deficiencies or to carry out the recommendations contained therein which shall be re tained for five years from the date of such survey or inspection; (iii) records of all financial transactions which s hall be retained eight years from the date of the transaction; (iv) personnel records, which shall be retained six years from the date of employee termination or resignation; (v) records of complaints and appeals, which shall be retained three years from 65 resolution; and (vi) records of tracking, receipt and resolution of accident and incidents. (b) The hospice shall furnish annually to the depar tment a copy of: (1) the current annual report submitted to its gove rning body; and (2) other such data, records and reports as may be required by the department. 66 REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT Statutory Authority: Section 4010(4) of the Public Health Law authorizes the adoption and amendment of regulations for hospice providers approved pursuant to PHL Article 40 (Hospices). Section 4002 of the Public Health Law was amended b y adding a new subdivision 5 to read as follows: \"Terminally ill\" means an individu al has a medical prognosis that the individual's life expectancy is approximately one y ear or less if the illness runs its normal course. Legislative Objective: PHL Article 40 provides that hospice care may offer persons with terminal illness an appropriate palliative care alternative to curative treatments and protects such vulnerable individuals through the imposition of care delivery standards for providers. It is the legislative intent that hospice's interdisciplinary program and innovative approach to home and inpatient services be available statewide. The proposed regulations attempt to achieve these l egislative objectives by expanding the definition of terminal illness to conform with the statutory language as well as allow individuals the opportunity to receive hospice care earlier in their terminal illness - providing care to those who need it and reducing th e need for emergency room visits and hospital stays. Needs and Benefits: The proposed rule making was necessitated by change s in the federal conditions of participation/rules for hospice providers and recen t Medicaid Redesign Initiatives. State 67 rules have been revised and reordered to be consist ent with federal rules thereby facilitating provider compliance and surveillance a ctivities. The intent of these revisions is to improve care delivery processes and support p erformance improvement activity at the provider level. Additionally, amendments were a result of changes made in Chapter 441 of the Laws of 2011 and Medicaid Redesign effor ts to expand hospice benefits. Individuals could benefit from receiving hospice se rvices earlier in their terminal illness and having their symptoms managed on an on-going ba sis, thereby reducing the need for emergency room visits and hospital stays. Costs: Costs to Regulated Parties: Nominal costs may be incurred by hospice providers if coordination, management and documentation of care has not been effectively implemented by the hospice; or if data-driven, outcome-based quality assessment and p erformance improvement activities have not been taking place. These nominal costs are associated with federal quality assessment and performance improvement program requ irements and would have to be incurred regardless of the proposed regulatory chan ges. There are currently 45 hospices in New York State. Costs to the Agency and to the State and Local Gove rnments Including this Agency: The change in hospice patient eligibility which all ows individuals with a 12-month life expectancy to elect the hospice benef it, has been estimated to have a net aggregate increase in gross Medicaid expenditures o f $1,704,658. The aggregate NY State and Local Government share of the increase in Medicaid expenditures is approximately $400,000 for State government, and an other $400,000 for local 68 governments in the aggregate. Pursuant to 42 CFR S ection 447.205, the Department gave public notice in December 2011 to amend the NY S Medicaid Plan for hospice services to expand access to the hospice benefit. No additional costs are anticipated for the Agency or for State and Local Governments. Local Government Mandates: There are no local mandates in this rule. However, 6 counties operate hospice programs and will be required to meet these rules i n the same manner as will private entities, as there is no exemption authority for pu blicly sponsored programs. Paperwork: Under the proposed rules, providers will now be req uired to report verified incidences of mistreatment or abuse to the Departme nt of Health and or state/local bodies having jurisdiction, as required by federal rules. All other reporting requirements are consistent with existing regulations. Duplication: Proposed rules will be duplicative of, but consiste nt with, federal rules. There are no known conflicts with federal rules; consistency should facilitate provider compliance and improve effectiveness of surveillance processes . Alternatives: The Department could choose to retain existing stan dards in which case federal rules would supersede State rules where gaps or inc onsistency exist. This option was rejected as it would be confusing to both providers and surveyors. Furthermore, conforming state requirements to the federal requir ements will facilitate the enforcement of both. 69 Federal Standards: Section 418 of 42 CFR sets forth the federal rules for hospices. The proposed State rules are consistent with federal rules, but do exceed federal rules as follows: The quality assessment and performance improvement section includes the requirement to have a quality committee to assure c omprehensive representation and involvement in quality activities and to assure a b roader quality oversight process at the provider level. This is a state requirement that is not included in the federal rules. Infection control includes standards for prevention and management of HIV and other bloodborne pathogen infections, consisten t with existing standards for all provider types in NYS. The standards exceed federa l rules by including the required program specifications. The responsibilities of the governing body are more clearly delineated in the proposed rules than in the federal rules, including implementation of a complaint investigation procedure and requiring that the gove rning body obtain a Health Commerce System account for communication with the Departmen t. The proposed rule specifically states the requireme nts for contracts, including management contracts, to ensure hospice and provide r accountability and governing body responsibilities. Such requirements are not stated in the federal rules. Health requirements for personnel are specific and consistent with other provider types in NYS to assure adequate patient ca re protection. Job descriptions, employee identification and personnel records are a lso required as appropriate business practices. These requirements are not stated in th e federal rules. 70 Compliance Schedule: As the amendments ensure conformance with federal s tandards that were already in effect as of December 3, 2008, and any state req uirements exceeding federal rules are already in effect, regulated parties should already be in compliance, and should readily be able to comply as of the effective date of these re gulations.

There are 6 coun ty-based hospice providers. The small businesses which will be affected are hospice provi ders which employ fewer than 100 persons. There are approximately 36 small business hospices in NYS. Compliance Requirements: Regulated parties are expected to be in immediate c ompliance as these rules are consistent with federal standards already in effect as of Dec. 3, 2008, and rules that exceed the federal rules are already in place for e xisting hospice providers in NYS. The proposed regulations will create a new state report ing requirement, consistent with federal rules, for reporting verified instances of patient mistreatment, abuse or neglect to the Department or to other state and local authorit ies. The reporting will be done through existing complaint reporting mechanisms. The propo sed regulations also require the hospice to report to the Department data on quality indicators and patient outcomes, which will be the basis for performance improvement activities. This may require additional staff training and electronic data syste ms at the hospice. The Department implemented a hospice quality initiative intended t o assist hospices with meeting this requirement. All other reporting requirements ment ioned in the proposed regulations currently exist for the hospice providers. 72 The Department does not intend to publish a small b usiness regulation guide in connection with this regulation. Although a number of hospices are small businesses, the impact is not expected to be substantial. Additiona l guidance will be posted on the web as needed after the regulation is promulgated. Professional Services: No additional professional staff are expected to be needed as a result of the regulations. Quality assessment and performance imp rovement requirements could be handled by existing staff with appropriate training , unless staff shortages already exist at the hospice. Compliance Costs: There are no capital costs associated with these pr oposed rules. Additional costs may be associated with maintaining and analyzing da ta and carrying out performance improvement activities. The costs for small busine sses and county sponsored hospices should not be significantly different from the cost s to other affected providers. Economic and Technological Feasibility: The Department has considered feasibility and belie ves the rules can be met with minimal economic and technological impact. Departme ntal resources have been identified to assist hospices with quality indicato rs and performance improvement. Other regulations should not affect the routine cost of d oing business. Minimizing Adverse Impact: While the Department has considered the options of State Administrative Procedure Act (SAPA) Section 202-b(1) in developing this rule, flexibility does not exist 73 for any particular entity since the new requirement s are consistent with new federal rules already in effect. Small Business and Local Government Participations: The Hospice and Palliative Care Association of NYS, which represents the majority of the hospices statewide, were included d uring the development of the proposed rulemaking. The Department will meet the requirements of SAPA Section 202-b(6) in part by publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the State Register with a comment period. 74 RURAL AREA FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS Types and Estimated Numbers of Rural Areas: All counties in NYS have rural areas with the excep tion of 7 downstate counties. Counties with rural areas are served by 34 of the e xisting 47 hospices in NYS. Reporting, Record Keeping and Other Compliance Requ irements and Professional Services: Regulated parties are expected to be in immediate c ompliance as these rules are consistent with federal standards already in effect as of Dec. 3, 2008, and rules that exceed the federal rules are already in place for e xisting hospice providers in NYS. The proposed regulations will create a new state re porting requirement, consistent with federal rules, for reporting verified instance s of patient mistreatment, abuse or neglect to the Department or other state and local authorities. The reporting will be done through existing complaint reporting mechanisms. T he proposed regulations also require the hospice to report to the Department data on qua lity indicators and patient outcomes, which will be the basis for performance improvement activities. This may require additional staff training and electronic data syste ms at the hospice. The Department implemented a hospice quality initiative intended t o assist hospices with meeting this requirement. All other reporting requirements ment ioned in the proposed regulations currently exist for the hospice providers. Additional quality indicator and outcome data will need to be maintained in support of the reporting of the quality indicators and patient outcomes. This can be 75 accomplished by existing clinical and/or administra tive staff with appropriate training. Professional personnel required of the hospice is u nchanged from existing requirements. Costs: There are no capital costs associated with these ru les; any such costs would result from new federal rules, regardless of whether amend ments were made to state regulation. Additional training of staff in quality assessment and performance improvement may be required to be in compliance with the requirements of the new federal rules. Minimizing Adverse Impact: While the Department has considered the options in State Administrative Procedure Act (SAPA) Section 202-bb(2)(b), the prop osed regulatory changes are consistent with new federal requirements. Therefore , Department authority to minimize impact is limited. Adverse impact is expected to be minimal. Rural Area Impact: The Department will meet the requirements of SAPA S ection 202-bb(7) in part by publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the S tate Register with a comment period. 76 STATEMENT IN LIEU OF JOB IMPACT STATEMENT A Job Impact Statement is not required pursuant to Section 201-a(2)(a) of the State Administrative Procedure Act. The proposed r egulations are intended to be consistent with current federal rules and also expa nd the definition of \"terminal illness\" to allow expanded access to hospice services and im prove patient care. It is apparent, from the nature and purpose of the proposed rule, t hat it will not have a substantial adverse impact on jobs or employment opportunities. Pursuant to the authority vested in the Public Heal th and Health Planning Council and the Commissioner of Health by sections 3612(5) and 3612 (7)(a) of the Public Health Law, sections 763.7 and 766.4 of Title 10 (Health) of th e Official Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York are amende d, to be effective upon publication of a Notice of Adoption in the New York State Regis ter, to read as follows: Sections 763.7(a)(3)(i) and (ii) are amended as fol lows: 763.7 Clinical records. (a) The agency shall maintain a confidential clini cal record for each patient admitted to care or accepted for service to include: * * * (3) medical orders and nursing diagnoses to include all diagnoses, medications, treatments, prognoses, and need for palliative care . Such orders shall be: (i) signed by the authorized practitioner within [3 0 days] 12 months after admission to the agency, or prior to billing, whichever is sooner; (ii) signed by the authorized practitioner within [ 30 days] 12 months after issuance of any change in medical orders or prior to billing, which ever is sooner, to include all written and oral changes and changes made by telephone by s uch practitioner; and (iii) renewed by the authorized practitioner as fre quently as indicated by the patient's condition but at least every 60 days; 2 Sections 766.4(d)(1) and (2) are amended as follows : Section 766.4 Medical Orders * * * (d) Medical orders shall reference all diagnoses, m edications, treatments, prognoses, need for palliative care, and other pertinent patient in formation relevant to the agency plan of care; and (1) shall be authenticated by an authorized practit ioner within [thirty (30) days] 12 months after admission to the agency; and (2) when changes in the patient's medical orders ar e indicated, orders, including telephone orders, shall be authenticated by the aut horized practitioner within [thirty (30) days] 12 months. 3 REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT Statutory Authority: Section 3612(5) of the Public Health Law authorizes the adoption and amendment of regulations for certified home health agencies purs uant to Article 36 of the Public Health Law (Certified Home Health Agencies, Long Term Home Health Care Programs and AIDS Home Care Programs). Section 3612(7) (a) of t he Public Health Law authorizes the adoption and amendment of regulations for licen sed home care services agencies pursuant to Article 36. Legislative Objective: Article 36 of the Public Health Law was intended to promote the quality of home care services provided to residents of New York State an d to ensure their adequate availability as a viable alternative to institutional care. The proposed regulation furthers this objective by aligning state regulations with federal rules go verning payment for home health episodes, thereby making home care rules and regula tions clear and consistent to both home health providers and physicians ordering home health care services for their patients. Needs and Benefits: The proposed rule making achieves consistency with the federal rules governing home health episode payment for certified home heal th agencies, long term home health care programs and AIDS home care progra ms. There are no corresponding federal rules and regulations for licensed home car e services agencies. Home care providers have identified difficulties in obtaining signed physician orders under the current timeframe of thirty (30) days, wh ich adversely impacts their ability to 4 bill and receive payment for services that were del ivered based on verbal orders. The increased reliance on the use of hospitalists, whos e relationship with patients tend to be transient in nature, and the use of hospital based clinics for medical care, contribute to the difficulty in obtaining signed physician orders wit hin the current timeframes. Typically, the initial and subsequent follow-up physician orde rs are in the form of verbal orders. Obtaining the required signed orders from the physi cian who prescribed the care is challenging and time consuming. The current 30-day timeframe, coupled with payment rules, adversely impacts the ability of the home ca re agencies to bill and obtain reimbursement for services. The inability to obtain signed physician orders in the 30 day period was identified as a main concern of the Home and Community Based Care Workgroup (Workgroup). In 2013, the Legislature created the Workgroup by enac ting PHL Section 3614, as a response to changes in the delivery of, and reimbur sement for, home health care services through New York State's Medicaid Redesign initiati ves. The Workgroup, composed of eleven members representing providers, managed care plans and consumers, examined and made recommendations on issues which included b ut were not limited to state and federal regulatory requirements and related policy guidelines (including the applicability of the federal conditions of participation); effici ent home and community based care delivery, including telehealth and hospice services ; and alignment of functions between managed care entities and home and community based providers. The Workgroup, consistent with input from the provider association s, determined that a longer period to obtain signed physician orders would decrease the n umber of denied claims for payment from governmental payers. Additional input from Me dicaid payment policy makers also 5 indicated that extending the allowable time to obta in signed physician orders would alleviate the adverse impact related to claims subm issions and payment exception rules. Costs to Regulated Parties: The regulated parties (providers) are not expected to incur any additional costs as a result of the proposed rule change. There are no additional costs to local governments for the implementation of and continuing compliance with this amendment. Local Government Mandates: The proposed amendment does not impose any new prog rams, services, duties or responsibilities upon any county, city, town, villa ge, school district, fire district or other special district. Paperwork: There is no additional paperwork required of provid ers as a result of this amendment. Duplication: Proposed rules will be consistent with federal rule s for home health agencies certified to participate in the Medicare and Medica id programs. There are no known conflicts with federal rules; consistency should fa cilitate provider compliance and improve effectiveness of surveillance processes. Alternatives: The Department could choose to retain existing stan dards. During its discussions with providers, provider associations and the Workg roup, the Department evaluated timeframes ranging from sixty (60) days to two year s. After careful analysis, it was determined that 12 months is optimal because it pro vides consistency with payment rules for governmental payers. 6 Federal Standards: This amendment does not exceed any minimum standard s of the federal government for the same or similar subject areas. Compliance Schedule: There are no significant actions which are required by the affected providers to comply with the amendments. As the amendments are consistent with federal standards that were already in effect, and any state requirem ents exceeding federal rules are already in effect, regulated parties should already be in c ompliance, and should readily be able to comply as of the effective date of these regulation s.

The proposed amendment does not impose an adverse impac t on small businesses or local governments, and it does not impose additional repo rting, record keeping or other compliance requirements on small business home care agencies or local government home care agencies. The proposed amendment seeks to extend the timeframe agencies have to obtain signed physician orders . 8 STATEMENT IN LIEU OF RURAL AREA FLEXIBILITY ANALYSI S No rural area flexibility analysis is required purs uant to section 202-bb(4)(a) of the State Administrative Procedure Act. The propose d amendment does not impose an adverse impact on facilities in rural areas, and it does no t impose additional reporting, record keeping or other compliance requirements on facilities in rural areas. The proposed amendment seeks to extend the timeframe ag encies have to obtain signed physician orders . 9 STATEMENT IN LIEU OF JOB IMPACT STATEMENT No Job Impact Statement is required pursuant to se ction 201 a (2)(a) of the State Administrative Procedure Act. The proposed regulat ions are intended to be consistent with current federal rules for certified home healt h agencies and as consistent as feasible with proposed certified home health agency state re gulations for licensed home care services agencies. It is apparent, from the nature and purpose of the proposed rule, that it will not have a substantial adverse impact on jobs or employment opportunities. Pursuant to the authority vested in the Public Heal th and Health Planning Council by sections 206(1)(d), 225(5)(t), and 2733 of the Publ ic Health Law, sections 22.3 and 22.9 of Title 10 (Health) of the Official Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York are amended, to be effective upon publication of a Notice of Adoption in the New York State Register, to read as follows: \u00a7 22.3 - Supplementary reports of certain birth def ects [congenital anomalies] for epidemiological surveillance; filing.

PHL \u00a7 225(5)(t) provides that the State San itary Code may facilitate epidemiological research into the prevention of env ironmentally related diseases and require reporting of such diseases by physicians, m edical facilities and clinical laboratories. PHL \u00a7 2733 requires that birth defec ts and genetic diseases be reported by physicians, hospitals, and persons in attendance at birth in a manner prescribed by the Commissioner. Information collected pursuant to suc h reports shall be kept confidential pursuant the Personal Privacy Protection Act. Legislative Objectives: PHL \u00a7 206(1)(d) established the Commissioner's broa d authority to investigate the causes of disease in New York State. As reflec ted in the Declaration of Policy, the Legislature enacted PHL \u00a7 2733 and related statutes to ensure that the Department maintains a central and comprehensive responsibilit y for developing and administering the State's policy with respect to scientific inves tigations and research concerning the causes, prevention, treatment and cure of birth def ects and genetic and allied diseases. Finally, in enacting PHL \u00a7 225(5)(t), the Legislatu re directed that the State Sanitary Code contain regulations that facilitate epidemiological research into the prevention of environmental diseases, by pathological conditions of the body or mind resulting from 7 contact with toxins, mutagens or teratogens and by requiring the reporting of such diseases or suspected cases of such diseases to the Department. To these ends, the Department maintains the Congeni tal Malformation Registry (CMR) and has issued regulations requiring the repo rting of structural, functional or biochemical abnormalities determined genetically or induced during gestation, and which are not due to birthing events. Needs and Benefits: The Department's proposal seeks to extend the cas e capture periods for certain diseases. Currently, health regulations require phy sicians and hospitals to report birth defects that are diagnosed within two years of a ch ild's birth, yet many birth defects are not diagnosed until after age two. By extending th e capture period for certain diseases listed below, the Department's proposal will enhanc e its epidemiologic surveillance and advance its understanding of birth defects and thei r environmental causes. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a serious but preventable birth defect that resu lts from heavy maternal intake of alcohol during pregna ncy. FAS is not uncommon, with national estimates of 5-20 cases per 10,000 live bi rths. The annual prevalence of FAS reported by the CMR is about 10-fold less than nati onal estimates. Studies indicate that FAS is more easily diagnosed from ages two to ten y ears. Hereditary muscular dystrophies and other myopathie s are a family of diseases that cause progressive and steady muscle weakness a nd wasting. The most common muscular dystrophy is Duchenne MD, followed by Beck er MD. A recent US study indicated the prevalence of boys age 5 to 24 with D uchenne and Becker MD was 1.3 to 8 1.8 per 10,000 males. However, the CMR indicated an annual birth prevalence of only 0.08 per 10,000 live births. One study reported a m ean age of diagnosis of 5 years for boys with Duchenne MD. Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common organ system malformations, and they remain the leading cause of infant deaths from birth defects. Approximately 1 out of every 115 to 150 babies is b orn with a heart defect. Minor defects are often not detected until later in life and can have serious consequences. One study indicates that 3% of children with CHDs are diagnos ed from ages three to ten years old. Genetic and Chromosomal Anomalies. The CMR was esta blished prior to the sequencing of the human genome and the associated a dvances in the scientific community's understanding of the role genetics play s in causing birth defects. Because the field of genetics and birth defects is so new, there is little or no documentation about diagnostic timing for many of these syndromes. Howe ver, genetic and chromosomal anomalies are often not recognized until after two years of age, because it can require several years to observe a child prior to diagnosis . The Department's proposal would also require report ing of birth defects diagnosed or identified during pregnancy. This repo rting requirement is important due to the increase in routine prenatal screening. For man y diseases, the CMR data suggests a prevalence rate in New York that is far below the e xpected range. The proposed amendment also allows reporting by q ualified health care professionals other than physicians\u2014specifically, n urse practitioners and physician 9 assistants. Over the past several years, a growing number of national, state and specialty- specific studies indicate that the physician workfo rce in the United States is facing current and future shortages. Moreover, the shortag e of family physicians will be most acute in rural and underserved populations. These t rends highlight the need to allow reporting by nurse practitioners and physician assi stants. Indeed, anecdotal reports indicate that nurse practitioners and physician ass istants are already filling this role because of the burden on physicians. The regulation would also clarify the requirement t hat clinical laboratories performing diagnostic testing for birth defects mus t report to the CMR. This requirement is not new. In 1978, Commissioner Whalen issued a b lanket order directing that all laboratories report birth defects to the Department pursuant to PHL \u00a7 2733. However, many clinical laboratories are not aware of the rep orting requirement. The Department's proposal adds granularity to the l ist of reportable diseases. Many diseases currently reported fall under broad c ategories, thereby limiting the Department's ability to receive information concern ing the individual diseases within the category. For example, congenital leukemia and lym phangiomas are both currently reported under the broad classification of \"congeni tal anomalies of the circulatory system.\" The Department's proposal lists these and other defects as separate reportable conditions. Finally, the proposal replaces the term \"congenital malformation\" in favor of the term \"birth defect\" and renames the CMR the \"New Yo rk Birth Defects Monitoring 10 Program.\" In a nationally representative survey con ducted in 2007, respondents were asked what their first choice would be to describe problems at birth that can result in physical or mental disabilities. The preferred term was \"birth defects\". This term was chosen over congenital malformations and congenital anomalies, among other choices. Using the term that is preferred by the public will enable positive engagement with affected families and improve the Department's comm unication with the public. Costs to Regulated Parties: The Department anticipates that, for the entire Sta te, the regulatory changes will require annual reporting of an approximate addition al 900 live born children by physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistan ts, midwives, and hospitals (FAS: 100- 200 cases; muscular dystrophy: 100 cases; cardiac h eart defects in children past age two: 200 cases; genetic or chromosomal anomalies: 400 ca ses). Approximately 160 New York hospitals and their asso ciated physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and midwives wi ll be affected by this change. The Department anticipates that the costs to these part ies will be minimal, primarily because the number of additional birth defects to be report ed annually through hospitals (five to six cases per year, on average) will be small, rela tive to the number or reports already being submitted. Hospitals already report cases to the CMR electronically. The additional hospital staff time to enter six to seven additiona l cases per year may require 20-30 minutes annually. Alternatively, a hospital can inc orporate the additional diagnoses into a monthly batch file. Hospitals are already familiar with the process of modifying batch files. 11 Reporting by smaller, community-based health care facilities and individual providers will result in some costs primarily becau se, while physicians have always been required to report birth defects, this requirement has not been enforced for providers who are not associated with New York hospitals. The Dep artment has minimized the administrative costs associated with the reporting requirement by integrating the reporting process with technologies that healthcare providers already utilize. Healthcare providers currently rely on the Department's Health Commerce System (HCS) for communication and reporting to the Department. With in the HCS, the Department is implementing a comprehensive web-based reporting sy stem known as the Child Health Information Integration (CHI 2) project to be used as the central website to repo rt and track newborn screening, immunizations, lead and ne wborn hearing screening. Reporting of birth defects will become a component of the CHI2 system in order to reduce the reporting burden of community-based healthcare faci lities and providers. Providers will be required to spend 3-5 minutes ent ering case information for each child or fetus diagnosed with a birth defect that i s newly reportable under the updated CMR regulations. Statistically, this should involve very few cases for such providers. Because most providers already use and have free ac cess to the online electronic reporting system, the proposed regulation will not impose any additional equipment or technology costs. The only costs will be in the amo unt of time required to use the CHI 2 to report additional birth defects, which is expected to be negligible. The Department will assist any providers that currently do not have acc ess to the web based reporting system. With regards to extending the CMR reporting require ments to nurse practitioners, physician assistants and midwives, the Department d oes not expect that regulated parties 12 will incur any associated direct costs. Rather, the Department expects that this change will relieve physicians and hospitals from being th e only classes of healthcare providers authorized to submit a report when a child is diagn osed with a birth defect. For clinical laboratories, the Department anticipat es the regulatory change will require annual reporting of approximately 6,600 add itional genetic or chromosomal anomalies recognized during pregnancy, and approxim ately 400 reports related to children diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 10 yea rs old, for a total of 7,000 additional reports annually. The Department anticipates the o ngoing costs to the roughly 50 clinical cytogenetic laboratories providing diagnostic testi ng for genetic and chromosomal anomalies to be minimal because these laboratories will report using the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS) as man y already do. The Department estimates that the additional number of reports tha t these labs will make to ECLRS will cost approximately $1,400. Clinical laboratories ma y experience a one-time expense related to modifying the laboratory's software to i dentify the additional cases that must be reported, which the Department estimates will re quire a maximum of 16 hours of work by a computer specialist at an estimated rate of pa y of $100/hour. Costs to the Regulatory Agency: The Department has been using a web-based electron ic reporting system in place since 2006. Currently, the CMR receives and proces ses about 12,000 reports annually. Thus, annual cost to DOH to receive and process the additional 1,000-1,200 cases will be minimal. 13 Costs to the State Government: There will be no costs to state government. For the last ten years, reporting to the CMR has been conducted electronically. Currently, t he Department uses the Health Commerce System to receive CMR reports. Reporters u pload cases individually or in batch reports. The electronic reporting system alre ady includes automated processes to match and combine reports for the same child, to en sure de-duplication of data reported from multiple reporters. Additional data quality co ntrol processes are built into the system. Costs to Local Government: Hospitals owned by local governments would be affec ted but, as discussed above, the costs will be minimal because the additional re porting requirement is relatively small. Local Government Mandates: There are no mandates on local governments, othe r than the additional reporting requirements that would apply to hospitals owned by a local government. Paperwork: This change will generate very little physical pape rwork because reporting will be performed electronically as is described under \"Cos ts to Regulated Parties.\" Duplication: 14 This change does not involve any duplication in law s. In terms of duplication of effort, the reporting software will prevent the rep eated reporting of the same birth defect for a particular child. Alternatives: If no changes are made to this regulation, the Depa rtment will continue to collect incomplete reporting for birth defects, and prevale nce estimates will remain inaccurate. This will impede the Department's ability to detect and quantify environmental exposures that negatively impact the health of embryos and fe tuses in New York State. Concerning FAS, in particular, failure to change t he reporting requirement will hamper prevention efforts and may cost New York mor e in the long-term. One study placed the nationwide annual cost of treating birth defects associated with FAS at $1.6 billion. Another study used a societal perspective and generated nationwide cost estimates of $9.69 billion. These costs included es timates of the value of productivity lost as a result of cognitive disabilities, as well as t he cost of treatment and residential care. In addition to improving outcomes for affected childre n, early diagnosis and appropriate interventions are likely to generate significant co sts savings over time. Federal Standards: There are no federal mandates for state-level repor ting of birth defects. However, several of the 36 state birth defect surveillance p rograms require reporting of these birth defects past the age of 2 years, including Hawaii, Texas, Washington State and Colorado. At least eleven states receive reports of birth def ects that occur during pregnancy. 15 Compliance Schedule: Regulations will take effect immediately upon filing. The Department will continue its efforts to make reporting easier and m ore efficient, while simultaneously conducting outreach to understand and address any c oncerns that may arise.

PHL \u00a7 225(5)(t) provides that the State San itary Code may facilitate epidemiological research into the prevention of env ironmentally related diseases and require reporting of such diseases by physicians, m edical facilities and clinical laboratories. PHL \u00a7 2733 requires that birth defec ts and genetic diseases be reported by physicians, hospitals, and persons in attendance at birth in a manner prescribed by the Commissioner. Information collected pursuant to suc h reports shall be kept confidential pursuant the Personal Privacy Protection Act. Legislative Objectives: PHL \u00a7 206(1)(d) established the Commissioner's broa d authority to investigate the causes of disease in New York State. As reflec ted in the Declaration of Policy, the Legislature enacted PHL \u00a7 2733 and related statutes to ensure that the Department maintains a central and comprehensive responsibilit y for developing and administering the State's policy with respect to scientific inves tigations and research concerning the causes, prevention, treatment and cure of birth def ects and genetic and allied diseases. Finally, in enacting PHL \u00a7 225(5)(t), the Legislatu re directed that the State Sanitary Code contain regulations that facilitate epidemiological research into the prevention of environmental diseases, by pathological conditions of the body or mind resulting from 17 contact with toxins, mutagens or teratogens and by requiring the reporting of such diseases or suspected cases of such diseases to the Department. To these ends, the Department maintains the Congeni tal Malformation Registry (CMR) and has issued regulations requiring the repo rting of structural, functional or biochemical abnormalities determined genetically or induced during gestation, and which are not due to birthing events. Needs and Benefits: The currently proposed amendments to the existing r egulation will modernize the CMR in six ways and improve the ability of the CMR to meet the original objectives of the legislation. First, the amendments will establi sh a case reporting period of ten years for certain defects that often are not diagnosed wi thin the current two-year capture period. The defects subject to the 10-year reporting requir ements are: fetal alcohol syndrome (\"FAS\"); Becker muscular dystrophy; he art malformations; and chromosomal and genetic anomalies. Second, the amendments will institute case reportin g for birth defects diagnosed during pregnancy. Third, the changes will allow rep orting from nurse practitioners, physician assistants and midwives, thereby reducing the reporting burden on pediatricians, obstetricians, general and other pra ctitioners and improving reporting in communities where physicians are scarce. Fourth, th e amendments will add granularity to the reported data by creating separate categories f or certain diseases that are currently reported under a single, broad category. Finally, t he changes clarify prior requirements 18 for clinical cytogenetic laboratories to report dia gnostic test results for chromosomal and genetic anomalies. The Department's proposal seeks to extend the cas e capture periods for certain diseases. Currently, health regulations require phy sicians and hospitals to report birth defects that are diagnosed within two years of a ch ild's birth, yet many birth defects are not diagnosed until after age two. In particular, c onditions such as fetal alcohol syndrome, Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy, c ertain heart malformations, and some chromosomal and genetic anomalies are not diag nosed until the child is older than two years. By extending the capture period for certain disea ses, the Department's proposal will enhance its epidemiologic surveillance and adv ance its understanding of birth defects and their environmental causes. The Department's pr oposal seeks to update the capture periods for the following diseases: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a serious but preventable birth defect that resu lts from heavy maternal intake of alcohol during pregna ncy. Significantly, the hallmark signs of FAS are challenging to recognize in infant s. FAS is not uncommon, with national estimates of occ urrence at 5-20 cases per 10,000 live births. For birth years 2001 to 2007, t he annual prevalence of FAS reported by the CMR was 0.64 per 10,000 live births, about 1 0-fold less than national estimates. These figures suggest significant underreporting of FAS in New York State. Further, studies indicate that FAS is more easily diagnosed from ages two to ten years. A comparison of the CMR with other FAS surveillance d ata found that, in one region of 19 New York State, almost 30% of FAS cases were diagno sed after the age of two. In addition, a recent analysis of children referred to an Erie County FAS Diagnostic Center found the average age of diagnosis of FAS to be 4.9 years, with only 39% diagnosed before their second birthday and 82% diagnosed by a child's tenth birthday. Consistent with current CMR regulations, these diagnoses were not required to be reported to the CMR for children over the age of two. These finding s support the Department's proposal to extend the case capture period for FAS to ten ye ars of age. Hereditary muscular dystrophies and other myopathie s are a family of diseases that cause progressive and steady muscle weakness a nd wasting. The most common muscular dystrophy is Duchenne MD, followed by Beck er MD (together, \"DBMD\"). The age of onset and severity of symptoms are unique fo r each dystrophy, as is the average age of diagnosis for individuals. Worldwide, the birth prevalence of Duchenne MD is e stimated at 1 to 3.9 per 10,000 live births, and a recent US study indicated the prevalence of boys age 5 to 24 with DBMD for 2007 was 1.3 to 1.8 per 10,000 males. However, the CMR indicated an annual birth prevalence of \"hereditary progressive muscular dystrophy\" from 1998 to 2007 of only 0.08 per 10,000 live births. The remar kable difference in these statistics suggests significant underreporting of Duchenne MD in New York State. The statistical difference is likely the result of New York's inadequate two-year case capture period, at least in part. Duchenne MD is commonly not suspected until the child is over two years of age, and one study repor ted a mean age of diagnosis of 5 years. According to the Department's records, 95% of child ren were diagnosed with DBMD before their tenth birthday. By increasing the capt ure period of Duchenne MD to ten 20 years of age, the Department will improve the accur acy and completeness of its surveillance for this disease, which will help the Department understand the prevalence of this condition and identify regions where health care services may be inadequate. Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common organ system malformations, and they remain the leading cause of infant deaths from birth defects. Approximately 1 out of every 115 to 150 babies is b orn with a heart defect, compared to only 1 in every 800 to 1,000 babies born with Down syndrome. Variation in prevalence has been associated with maternal race and ethnicit y. Although major heart defects are usually apparent i n a newborn, minor defects are often not detected until later in life and can have serious consequences. One study indicates that 70% of children with CHD are diagnos ed within the first year of life; an additional 18% are diagnosed in year 2; and 3% are diagnosed up to seven years later. That study found that children with CHD with few or mild symptoms are frequently under-diagnosed, especially in areas with inadequat e health services (e.g., lack of nearby tertiary centers and/or cardiology services; insuff icient pediatrician awareness and expertise regarding mild malformations). Further, i n the past decade, there have been significant advances in medical technologies that c an detect mild CHDs in children older than two years of age. These findings support the Department's proposal to extend the case capture period for CHDs to ten years of age. The improved s urveillance will assist the Department's efforts to study causation and support its prevention efforts. Genetic and Chromosomal Anomalies. The CMR was esta blished prior to the sequencing of the human genome and the associated a dvances in the scientific 21 community's understanding of the role genetics play s in causing birth defects. Because the field of genetics and birth defects is so new, there is little or no documentation in the literature about diagnostic timing for many of thes e syndromes. However, it is known that genetic and chromosomal a nomalies are often not recognized until after two years of age, because it can require several years to observe a child prior to diagnosis. Genetic testing may also be delayed past the age of two because of the cost, insurance policies, or other restricti ons related to genetic testing. By capturing data concerning those children diagnos ed with birth defects through genetic and chromosomal testing, the Department wil l enhance its understanding of the epidemiology of these diseases. The following are t wo examples of genetic anomalies that will be captured under the CMR's proposed case capture periods. DiGeorge syndrome (\"DGS\", also called velocardiofac ial syndrome, or VCFS) is a disease that creates cognitive impairments, among other things. DGS has an estimated incidence of 2.5/10,000 live births, yet the CMR's annual birth prevalence of this genetic microdeletion from 1998 to 2007 was only 0.55/10,00 0 live births. Notably, when a child has minimal facial dysmorphisms, minor cardiac anom alies, and slight cognitive impairments, the child may not be diagnosed within two years of birth. These findings suggest underreporting of DGS in New York State. The Department believes that the likely underreport ing can be remedied, at least in part, by extending the case capture period. A l onger capture period, to age 10 years, will dramatically improve the Department's ability to identify children with this disease. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiti ng recessive genetic disorder in Caucasians, with an incidence of 3.1/10,000 live bo rn in the U.S. The reported incidence 22 has varied from 0.5/10,000 to 3.3/10,000 live birth s, depending on the population sampled and the method of detection (i.e., newborn screening, newly reported cases, or calculations based on death certificates). However, the CMR's annual birth prevalence of CF from 1998 to 2007 was 1.16 per 10,000 live birth s. The discrepancy in these statistics likely reflects the CMR's insufficient two-year win dow of surveillance, which the Department's proposal seeks to address. The Department's proposal would also require report ing of birth defects diagnosed or identified during pregnancy. This repo rting requirement is important due to the increase in routine prenatal screening. For exa mple, observational studies and clinical trials suggest that periconceptual use of folic aci d can reduce neural tube defects (NTDs), including anencephaly and spina bifida. In New Yor k State, however, the Department is currently unable to accurately confirm this associa tion or the impact of prevention efforts, because these defects are often diagnosed early in pregnancy and may result in pregnancy outcome other than live birth. Therefore, many NTD s may not be reported to the Congenital Malformations Registry under the current regulations. In general, for many diseases, the CMR data appears to suggest a prevalence rate in New York that is far below the range of what wou ld be expected, where an approximate expected value is based on data gathere d in other states through the National Birth Defects Prevention Network. In particular, CM R data indicates an anencephaly prevalence rate in New York that is approximately 8 4% less than expected; for anophthalmia, 94% trisomy 18% less than expected; for Edwards syndrome or trisomy 18, 56% l ess than expected; spina bifida 23 without anencephaly, 73% less than expected; and fo r encephalocele, 44% less than expected. It is highly improbable that the CMR's ex tremely low prevalence figures reflect the actual prevalence of these diseases in New York State. Rather, the figures are very likely the result of under-reporting by hospitals a nd healthcare professionals. These deficiencies in data impede the Department's ability to study the prevalence of birth defects in New York and its rel ation to environmental factors. The proposed regulatory amendments would correct these deficiencies. The proposed amendment also allows reporting by q ualified health care professionals other than physicians\u2014specifically, n urse practitioners, physician assistants, and midwives. Over the past several yea rs, a growing number of national, state and specialty-specific studies indicate that the ph ysician workforce in the United States is facing current and future shortages. The number of generalist residency graduates and medical students entering primary care has declined each year since 1998. Moreover, the shortage of family physicians will be most acute in rural and underserved populations. These trends highlight the need to allow reporting by nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and midwives. Indeed, anecdotal reports indicate that nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and midwives are already fill ing this role because of the burden on physicians. Additionally, reporting by nurse practitioners an d physician assistants is key to diagnosing children with fetal alcohol syndrome. Ch ildren with fetal alcohol syndrome are more likely to be in foster care settings and c overed by Medicaid. Programs serving these children are more likely to employ nurse prac titioners and physician assistants 24 rather than physicians. Thus, to obtain meaningful data concerning fetal alcohol syndrome as well as other birth defects, it is impe rative that nurse practitioners and physician assistants be required to report to the C MR. The regulation would also clarify the requirement t hat clinical laboratories performing diagnostic testing for birth defects mus t report to the CMR. This requirement is not new. In 1978, Commissioner Whalen issued a b lanket order directing that all laboratories report birth defects to the Department pursuant to PHL \u00a7 2733. Although that order remains legally effective, 35 years have pass ed and many clinical laboratories are not aware of the reporting requirement. Placing the requirement in the regulations will help ensure that clinical laboratories are aware th at they must report diagnostic test results to the CMR. This will also support the capt ure of cases where diagnosis is either occurs during pregnancy or is delayed past age two. The Department's proposal adds granularity to the l ist of reportable diseases. Many diseases currently reported fall under broad c ategories, thereby limiting the Department's ability to receive information concern ing the individual diseases within the category. For example, congenital leukemia and lym phangiomas are both currently reported under the broad classification of \"congeni tal anomalies of the circulatory system.\" The Department's proposal lists these and other defects as separate reportable conditions. 25 Finally, the proposal replaces the term \"congenital malformation\" in favor of the term \"birth defect\" and renames the CMR the \"New Yo rk Birth Defects Monitoring Program.\" In a nationally representative survey co nducted in 2007, respondents were asked what their first choice would be to describe problems at birth that can result in physical or mental disabilities. The preferred term was \"birth defects\". This term was chosen over congenital malformations and congenital anomalies, among other choices. Using the term that is preferred by the public will enable positive engagement with affected families and improve the Department's comm unication with the public. Costs to Regulated Parties: The Department anticipates that, for the entire Sta te, the regulatory changes will require annual reporting of an approximate addition al 900 live born children by physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistan ts and hospitals (FAS: 100-200 cases; muscular dystrophy: 100 cases; cardiac heart defect s in children past age two: 200 cases; genetic or chromosomal anomalies: 400 cases). Approximately 160 New York hospitals and their asso ciated physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and midwives w ill be affected by this change. The Department anticipates that the costs to these part ies will be minimal, primarily because the number of additional birth defects to be report ed annually through hospitals (five to six cases per year, on average) will be small, rela tive to the number or reports already being submitted. Hospitals already report cases to the CMR electronically using one of two methods: by individual child and by batch file. To report a child individually, hospital staff log onto the secure CMR website and enter the required data. It takes about 26 3 to 5 minutes to enter a complete case. Alternativ ely, hospitals can submit monthly batch files to the CMR. The additional hospital staff tim e to enter six to seven additional cases per year may require 20-30 minutes annually. Altern atively, a hospital can incorporate the additional diagnoses into a monthly batch file. Hospitals are already familiar with the process of modifying batch files, so this process i s not new or unusual. Reporting by smaller, community-based health care facilities and individual providers will result in some costs primarily becau se, while physicians have always been required to report birth defects, this requirement has not been enforced for providers who are not associated with New York hospitals. The Dep artment has minimized the administrative costs associated with the reporting requirement by integrating the reporting process with technologies that healthcare providers already utilize.

Statistically, this should involve very few cases for such providers. Because most providers already use and have free ac cess to the online electronic reporting system, the proposed regulation will not impose any additional equipment or 27 technology costs. The only costs will be in the amo unt of time required to use the CHI 2 to report additional birth defects, which is expected to be negligible. The Department will assist any providers that currently do not have acc ess to the web based reporting system. With regards to extending the CMR reporting require ments to nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and midwives, the Department does not expect that regulated parties will incur any associated direct costs. Rather, the Department expects that this change will relieve physicians and hospitals from being th e only classes of healthcare providers authorized to submit a report when a child is diagn osed with a birth defect. For clinical laboratories, the Department anticipat es the regulatory change will require annual reporting of approximately 6,600 add itional genetic or chromosomal anomalies recognized during pregnancy, and approxim ately 400 reports related to children diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 10 yea rs old, for a total of 7,000 additional reports annually. The Department anticipates the o ngoing costs to the roughly 50 clinical cytogenetic laboratories providing diagnostic testi ng for genetic and chromosomal anomalies to be minimal because these laboratories will report using the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS), which in turn provides appropriate reports to the CMR. These laboratories already use the ECLRS system. The Department estimates that the additional number of reports tha t these labs will make to ECLRS is expected to cost approximately $1,400. Clinical laboratories may experience a one-time exp ense related to modifying the laboratory's software to identify the additional ca ses that must be reported. However, the Department estimates that it would require a maximu m of two days (16 hours) of work by a computer specialist to modify software to iden tify the additional cases required by 28 the regulation for reporting to ECLRS. The estimat ed rate of pay for a computer specialist is up to $100/hour. Costs to the Regulatory Agency: The Department has been using a web-based electron ic reporting system in place since 2006. Currently, the CMR receives and proces ses about 12,000 reports annually. Thus, annual cost to DOH to receive and process the additional 1,000-1,200 cases will be minimal. Costs to the State Government: There will be no costs to state government. For the last ten years, reporting to the CMR has been conducted electronically. Currently, t he Department uses the Health Commerce System to receive CMR reports. Reporters u pload cases individually or in batch reports. The electronic reporting system alre ady includes automated processes to match and combine reports for the same child, to en sure de-duplication of data reported from multiple reporters.

Local Government Mandates: 29 There are no mandates on local governments, othe r than the additional reporting requirements that would apply to hospitals owned by a local government. Paperwork: This change will generate very little physical pape rwork because reporting will be performed electronically. In terms of electronic re porting requirements, physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and hospitals w ill be required to submit a total of approximately 900 additional reports to the CMR ann ually. Hospitals already report cases to the CMR electronically using one of two methods: by individual child and by batch file. It takes about 3 to 5 minutes to enter an ind ividual case. On average, hospitals will need to make an additional six to seven reports ann ually. The additional hospital staff time to enter six to seven additional cases per yea r may require 20-30 minutes annually. Alternatively, a hospital can incorporate the addit ional diagnoses into a monthly batch file, which will save some time. Hospitals are alre ady familiar with the process of modifying batch files, so this process is not new o r unusual. Smaller healthcare providers will also be required to spend 3-5 minutes entering case information for each child or fetus diagnosed with a birth defect that is newly reportable under the updated CMR regulations. Stati stically, this should involve very few cases for such providers. The Department will assis t any providers that currently do not have access to the web based reporting system. For all clinical laboratories, the Department antic ipates the regulatory change will require annual reporting of approximately an additi onal 7,000 genetic or chromosomal anomalies. Laboratories will use the Electronic Cl inical Laboratory Reporting System 30 (ECLRS), which in turn provides appropriate reports to the CMR. These laboratories already use the ECLRS system, and the additional nu mber of reports that individual laboratories will make to ECLRS is relatively small and does not represent a significant reporting burden. Duplication: This change does not involve any duplication in law s. In terms of duplication of effort, the reporting software will prevent the rep eated reporting of the same birth defect for a particular child. Alternatives: If no changes are made to this regulation, the Depa rtment will continue to collect incomplete reporting for birth defects, and prevale nce estimates will remain inaccurate. This will impede the Department's ability to detect and quantify environmental exposures that negatively impact the health of embryos and fe tuses in New York State. Concerning FAS, in particular, failure to change t he reporting requirement will hamper prevention efforts and may cost New York mor e in the long-term. One study placed the nationwide annual cost of treating birth defects associated with FAS at $1.6 billion. Another study used a societal perspective and generated nationwide cost estimates of $9.69 billion. These costs included es timates of the value of productivity lost as a result of cognitive disabilities, as well as t he cost of treatment and residential care. In addition to improving outcomes for affected childre n, early diagnosis and appropriate interventions are likely to generate significant co sts savings over time. 31 Federal Standards: There are no federal mandates for state-level repor ting of birth defects. However, several of the 36 state birth defect surveillance p rograms require reporting of these birth defects past the age of 2 years. For example, FAS m ust reported at any age in Hawaii, to age six in Texas, and to age 10 in Washington State . In Colorado, reporting of most defects is up to age 3, but reporting of FAS is req uired up to age 10. Other states have FAS capture periods ranging from 4 to 18 years. At least eleven states receive reports of birth defects that occur during pregnancy. Compliance Schedule: Regulations will take effect immediately upon filing. The Department will continue its efforts to make reporting easier and m ore efficient, while simultaneously conducting outreach to understand and address any c oncerns that may arise. 32 Contact Person: Katherine Ceroalo New York State Department of Health Bureau of House Counsel, Regulatory Affairs Unit Corning Tower Building, Rm. 2438 Empire State Plaza Albany, New York 12237 (518) 473-7488 (518) 473-2019 (FAX) REGSQNA@health.ny.gov 33 REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS FOR SMALL BUSINESSE S AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS Effect of Rule: This amended rule will have limited impact on smal l businesses providing health care because many of these businesses are affiliate d with a general hospital. These small businesses include community-based healthcare provi ders (pediatricians, family practitioners and maternal-fetal medicine specialis ts) and some laboratories with small offices. The amended rule will have a small impact on those healthcare facilities that are owned by local governments and that also diagnose b irth defects and genetic diseases. These healthcare facilities will be required to mak e additional reports to the CMR based on the updated list of reportable birth defects and genetic diseases. Although the Department does not maintain a listing of local gov ernment-owned facilities that would be required to report, the Greater NY Hospital Asso ciation estimated that the number is relatively few. Further, the Department reasonably expects the burden on such facilities to be small\u2014only 3-5 minutes per additional case. The number of cases will vary depending on the size of the facility, but the Depa rtment estimates that such facilities will report an average of 5-6 newly reportable cases per year, per facility. Compliance Requirements: Because healthcare providers and facilities are tr ansitioning to electronic record- keeping systems, reporting and record keeping are e xpected to be simple and require very little time. The Department publishes a CMR guide t o assist hospitals with reporting. A 34 guide will also be developed for other healthcare p roviders as well as clinical laboratories. Professional Services: No additional professional services are required u nder the amended rule. Compliance Costs: Staff working in small community-based healthcare providers and small clinical laboratories will need to learn how to report with the updated CMR requirements. Economic and Technological Feasibility: The amended rule is economically and technological ly feasible because local governments and small businesses that are affected will continue submitting reports using their free access to the Department's electronic re porting system. Minimizing Adverse Impact: By offering free access to the electronic reportin g system, the Department has minimized the costs and impact on local governments and small businesses operating in New York State. Small Business and Local Government Participation: The Department has reached out to the healthcare co mmunity to gather feedback on the proposed amended rule. Those contacted inclu de: NYS American Academy of Pediatrics, NYS Academy of Family Physicians, Nurse Practitioner Association of NYS, NYS Nurses Association, NYS Society of Physician As sistants, NY Health Information Management Association, Greater NY Hospital Associa tion, Healthcare Association of NYS, NYS March of Dimes, NYS Clinical Geneticists, Genetic Counselors, Midwives, Neurologists, Neuromuscular Specialists, and Pediat ric Cardiologists. Additionally, the 35 Department contacted other NYS agencies and program s which provide services to children affected by these birth defects, specifica lly fetal alcohol syndrome. The Department received comments from two organizat ions that represent health care providers. The President of the New York State Society of Physician Assistants stated, \"After soliciting input from our leadership , we wholeheartedly support this suggested regulatory change.\" No concern was expres sed about costs. Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), representing nearly 1 50 voluntary, not-for-profit, and public hospitals expressed concern that \"raising th e maximum reporting age to 10 ... could potentially create an administrative burden f or health care providers ... already contending with a wide range of such requirements.\" GNYHA strongly recommended that the DOH work closely with providers to develop and implement a reporting system that places the least possible amount of administra tive burden on those impacted by this potential regulatory change. The Department also received positive support for t hese regulatory changes from non-profit organizations and other State agencies, including the NYS Council on Children and Families, the NYS Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services, the NY State Education Department's Office of Special E ducation, and the Long Island Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence. These or ganizations view the proposed regulatory change as positive steps for meeting the needs of children and families affected by these devastating birth defects. The Department asked several maternal-fetal medicin e practices for input concerning the proposed changes and received replie s from three practices (Hudson Valley Perinatal Consulting, Harrison, NY; Universi ty GYN/OB, Inc, at Women and 36 Children's Hospital of Buffalo, Buffalo, NY; and Fe tal Testing Unit of Mercy Hospital Buffalo South, Buffalo, NY). As for access to the D epartment's web based reporting system, one had access, one did not, and the third was uncertain. All three expressed concerns about time required to report and assuranc es of patient confidentiality. The Department reached out to the NYS Association o f Licensed Midwives, who supported the amendment. In a survey sent to midwiv es, all respondents supported the regulatory amendment. The most common concern was t he time required to comply, which the Department will minimize through its elec tronic reporting. Public Health Law \u00a7 206(1)(j) ensures that diagnose s reported to the New York Birth Defects Monitoring Program shall be kept conf idential and shall be used solely for the purposes of the Department's scientific researc h. The statute further provides that such records are not admissible as evidence in a co urt of law. Regarding time to report, the Department expects that some of these practices may not actually have to report separately but that their associated institution or hospital will be able to assume that responsibility, thus reducing the anticipated burde n. The Department is committed to minimizing the admin istrative burden of these new reporting requirements. By using the CHI 2 system as a reporting tool, the administrative burden will not be significant. The Department will continue to communicate with st akeholders throughout the regulatory process. Prior to adoption of the rule, all amendments will appear in the New York State Register for public comment. 37 RURAL AREA FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS Types and Estimated Numbers of Rural Areas: This regulation would apply statewide and affect t he 44 counties that are considered rural. Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requi rements; and Professional Services: This change involves a small increase in reporting using a system already being utilized by healthcare professionals to submit othe r reports. No additional requirement for professional services is required under the ame nded regulation. Costs: There is minimal cost to report. The costs are ass ociated with staff time to report additional cases electronically. The number of addi tional cases to be reported is expected to be small relative to the number of cases already reported. Minimizing Adverse Impact: Any adverse impact will be minimized by using the Department's pre-existing Health Commerce System for electronic reporting. Th e impact will be further reduced when the Department implements the CHI 2 reporting system. Rural Area Participation: Regulated parties in rural areas have been contacte d through the Department's reaching out to statewide associations of healthcar e professionals, such as the NYS American Academy of Pediatrics, NYS Academy of Fami ly Physicians, Nurse Practitioner Association of NYS, NYS Nurses Associa tion, NYS Society of Physician 38 Assistants, NY Health Information Management Associ ation, Healthcare Association of NYS, NYS March of Dimes, and NYS Clinical Geneticis ts. 39 JOB IMPACT STATEMENT Nature of Impact: There will be minimal impact, because health care f acilities are currently required to report other conditions to the Department of Hea lth. The Department does not expect there to be a positive or negative impact on jobs o r employment opportunities. Categories and Numbers Affected: The Department anticipates no negative impact on jo bs or employment opportunities as a result of the amended rule. Regions of Adverse Impact: The Department anticipates no negative impact on jo bs or employment opportunities in any particular region of the state . Minimizing Adverse Impact: Not applicable. SUMMARY OF EXPRESS TERMS A new section for Part 415 of Title 10 (Health) of the Official Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York is p roposed, to be designated as section 415.41 and entitled \"Specialized Programs for Resid ents with Neurodegenerative Diseases\". (a) General. For purposes of the proposed regulati on, \"Neurodegenerative Disease\" shall Sc lerosis. \"Specialized program\" means a discrete unit within a nursing home that of fers services and facilities for individuals with Neurodegenerative Diseases, with t he goal of helping them attain or maintain the highest practicable level of physical, affective, behavioral and cognitive functioning. The program must be located in a nurs ing unit which is specifically designated for this purpose and physically separate from other facility units. The proposed regulation also provides that the faci lity shall make information and data available to assist the Department of Health (Depar tment) in evaluating the effectiveness of specialty units and their impact on outcomes for individuals with Neurodegenerative Diseases. Such evaluation will be conducted four y ears after the adoption of the proposed regulation and the Department will conside r whether changes are warranted to the programmatic requirements. (b) Admission. The proposed regulation requires n ursing homes to develop written 2 admission criteria for specialty units for individu als with Neurodegenerative Diseases. At a minimum, the resident's medical record must do cument that the resident has a Neurodegenerative Disease diagnosis, cannot appropr iately be served and is not safe in a less restrictive setting, and can benefit from the care and services available in a specialty unit. The proposed regulation also provides that t he facility shall evaluate the effects of its admission criteria on its success in achieving its goals and objectives for the unit and requires the facility to report its findings to the Department no later than two years after the first admission to the unit and annually therea fter. (c) Assessment and Care Planning. The proposed reg ulation requires a home evaluation with the future resident and his or her family prio r to admission to discuss care needs. The proposed regulation also requires development o f a care plan for each resident, which shall include a discharge plan, by an interdi sciplinary resident care team. The care plan must be reviewed and modified at least once a month for the first three months following admission and then quarterly or upon a si gnificant change in the resident's condition thereafter. (d) Discharge. The proposed regulation requires th at a proposed discharge plan must be developed within 30 days of admission for each resi dent as part of the overall care plan and shall include input from all professionals cari ng for the resident, the resident and his or her family, as appropriate, and any outside agen cy or resource anticipated to be involved with the resident following discharge. Th e resident must be discharged to a less restrictive setting when he or she no longer meets one or more of the admission criteria 3 for the unit. Additionally, the proposed regulatio n provides that a facility shall evaluate the effects of its discharge criteria on its succes s in achieving the goals and objectives for the specialty unit and report its findings to the D epartment, beginning no later than two years after the first discharge from the unit and a nnually thereafter. Further, nursing homes with specialty units should use best efforts to coordinate with general hospitals expertise in caring for individua ls with Neurodegenerative Diseases. In the event of a transfer to any general hospital, th e facility must require a member of the specialty unit's staff to accompany the resident, i f feasible, and in any case must communicate with the hospital and provide any relev ant information about the resident at the time of transfer. The resident shall be given priority readmission status to the unit as warranted by his or her condition. (e) Program/Unit Staffing Requirements. The facili ty must maintain consistent assignment of direct care staff to residents in the specialty unit. In addition, the proposed regulation requires that a specialty unit shall be managed by a program coordinator and that a physician must be responsible for medical di rection of the unit. The proposed regulation also identifies other specific categorie s of personnel who must be assigned or available to the specialty unit, including a psychi atrist, a clinical psychologist or licensed clinical social worker, at least one registered pro fessional nurse on each shift, a respiratory therapist, and a therapeutic recreation specialist. 4 (f) Program/Unit Service and Environmental Requirem ents. The program must include a variety of medical, behavioral, counseling, recreat ion and exercise, nutrition and other services as appropriate to the needs of each indivi dual resident. Further, the environment shall be customized to both meet the needs and char acteristics of residents and minimize injuries to residents and staff. The proposed regu lation also provides that residents shall not be prevented from participating in approved cli nical trials and permits nursing homes with specialty units to facilitate participation th erein. (g) Program/Unit Training Requirements. The facili ty must ensure that all staff assigned to the direct care of the residents have pertinent experience or have received training in the care of people with Neurodegenerative Diseases. Training shall be appropriate to the functions and responsibilities of specific staff in the unit, and shall be made available to families, friends and caregivers of residents as ap propriate. The facility also must ensure that educational programs are conducted for staff w ho do not provide direct care but who come in contact with these residents on a regular b asis, such as housekeeping and dietary aides. 5 Pursuant to the authority vested in the Public Heal th and Health Planning Council and the Commissioner of Health in section 2803(2) of the Pu blic Health Law, Part 415 of Title 10 (Health) of the Official Compilation of Codes, Rules and Reg ulations of the State of New York, is amended by adding a new section 415.41 to be effective upon publication of a Notice of Adoption in the New York State Register, to read as follows: 415.41 Specialized Programs for Residents with Neur odegenerative Diseases. (a) General. 1. \"Specialized program\" shall mean a discrete unit with a planned array of servic es, staffing, equipment and physical facilities designe d to serve individuals with Neurodegenerative Diseases. The program shall provi de goal-directed, comprehensive and interdisciplinary services directed at attaining or maintaining the individual at his or her highest practicable level of physical, affective, b ehavioral, psychosocial and cognitive functioning. 2. For purposes of this section, \"Neurodegenerative Disease\" shall mean Huntington's disease or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. 3. For purposes of this section, and consistent wit h the requirements of section 415.11 of this Part, the \"interdisciplinary resident care tea m\" shall, at a minimum, include the resident's physician, a registered professional nur se with responsibility for the resident and, depending on the resident's diagnosis, needs a nd symptoms, other appropriate staff in disciplines as determined by the resident's need s, which may include staff assigned to 6 the unit as set forth in subdivision (e) of this se ction. 4. The program shall be located in a nursing unit w hich is specifically designated for this purpose and physically separate from other facility units. Resi dents of the unit shall have access to the facility's centralized recreational and therapeutic resources that are not located in the unit. 5. In addition to the implementation of the quality assessment and assurance plan for this program as required by section 415.27 of this Part, the facili ty shall participate with the department in an evaluation of the efficacy and eff ectiveness of the program and its impact on resident, family and staff outcomes, to be conducted four years after th e adoption of this section. 6. The factors to be reviewed shall include but not be limited to resident, family and staff characteristics and outcomes, including staff, resi dent and family satisfaction, falls, tailored care planning, injuries (staff and residen ts), health care and services utilization, including hospitalization and emergency room admiss ions; nursing home and hospital length of stay; and discharge status. The facility shall collect data and furnish records, reports and data in a format as requested by the de partment and shall make members of the interdisciplinary resident care team available for participation in the evaluation, as requested by the department. Following completion of such ev aluation, the department shall consider whether any revisions to the programmatic requirements for Neurodegenerative Disease specialty units are necessary. 7 (b) Admission. 1. This provision shall be implemented as a Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) project. The facility shall develop written admission criteria for the specialty unit, to include the criteria in paragraph (2) of this subdivision and t ake into account the facility's goals and objectives regarding outcomes (e.g. self-inflicted injuries/falls, chorea-related trauma, hospitalizat ion (length of stay), emergency department utilization, bed hold, and satisfaction surveys of residents with Neurodegenerative Diseases, staff, families, and others) for residents who liv e in the specialty unit. The facility shall evaluate the effects of its admission criteria on its succes s in achieving its goals and objectives for the unit and report its findings to the department no later than two years after the effective date of this rule and annually thereafter. 2. At a minimum, for residents admitted to the unit , there shall be documented evidence in the resident's medical record that: (i) the resident has been diagnosed with Neurodegen erative Disease as determined by highly suggestive family history, neurological test ing, genetic testing when available, formal consultation setting, or formal neurological diagnostic consultation. (ii) the resident cannot be managed and is not safe and his or her needs cannot be met in an available, less restrictive setting; and (iii) the resident has the ability to benefit from the specialized care and services available 8 in the unit. (c) Assessment and Care Planning. 1. Any assessment of a potential resident must incl ude the admission criteria described in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. Where feasib le, one or more members of the staff of the specialty unit shall conduct an evaluation of the home or current residence, living situation (e.g. homeless), or inpatient setting, of the future resident and his/her family prior to admission to discuss care needs. For purposes of this paragraph, \"feasible\" means the resident's home or other setting is within reas onable travel distance (in terms of round trip travel time) from either the facility or the h ome(s) of the staff member(s) conducting the home evaluation. The staff member(s) shall ide ntify preliminary approaches and interventions appropriate for the resident and, bas ed on the results of the evaluation, shall record them in the resident's care plan prior to ad mission to the unit. 2. Each resident's care plan shall include care and services that are therapeutically beneficial to the resident, appropriate to the resident's interests a nd selected by the resident or resident's caregiver as appropriate. The care plan shall be prepared by the interdisciplinary resident care team prior to the r esident's admission to the unit and may require environmental accommodations. 3. Based on the resident's response to therapeutic interventions, as well as the progression of the disease and its impact on the resident's functionin g, health and psychosocial status, the resident shall be reassessed and the care plan, including the dischar ge plan, shall be 9 reviewed and modified at least once a month for the first three months following admission and then quarterly or upon any significan t change in the resident's condition thereafter. The care plan shall be reviewed by at l east three members of the interdisciplinary team and shall include at least one certified nurse aide who is as signed to the resident on a permanent basis. 4. Facility or unit staff shall initiate a discussi on of advance directives, in accordance with the provisions of section 400.21 of this Subchapter , with the resident or the resident's family member or other adult, consistent with secti on 400.21 as soon as practicable following the decision to admit the resident to the unit. (d) Discharge. 1. This provision shall be implemented as a Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) project. The facility shall develop written discharge criteria for the specialty unit, which at a minimum shall address th e provisions of paragraph (5) of this subdivision. 2. The resident and his or her family and/or caregi vers shall be notified of discharge criteria upon admission. 3. A written discharge plan shall be developed with in 30 days of admission for each resident as part of the overall care plan and shall include input fr om all professionals caring for the resident, the resident's family and/ or caregivers, as appropriate, and any 10 outside agency or resource anticipated to be involv ed with the resident following discharge. The discharge plan shall be reviewed and modified at least once a month for the first three months following admission and then quarterly or upon any significant change in the resident's condition thereafter. 4. When the interdisciplinary team determines that discharge of a resident to another facility or community-based program is appropriate, a discharge plan shall be implemented which is designed to assist and support the resident, family and caregiv ers in the transition to the new setting. The resident and his or her family and/or caregivers, as appropriate, shall receive preparation for discharg e from the specialty unit through the facility's educational and counseling services. 5. The resident shall be discharged to a less restr ictive setting when he or she no longer meets the minimum admission criteria for the unit s et forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of this section or meets other discharge criter ia established pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision. 6. The facility shall evaluate the effects of its discharge criteria on its success in achieving its goals and objectives for the unit and report its findings to the department beginning no later than two years after the effecti ve date of this rule and annually thereafter. 7. (i) The facility shall make best efforts to coor dinate with a general hospital or hospitals 11 that are known to have expertise in caring for indi viduals with Neurodegenerative Diseases to which residents can be transferred if a ppropriate. (ii) In the event a resident of a specialty unit r equires transfer to a general hospital: (a) When feasible, a resident who is transferred to a hospital shall be accompanied by an informed member of the program's direct care staff to ensure continuity of care. For purposes of this paragraph, \"feasible\" means that r ound trip travel time between the facility and the hospital is reasonable. (b) When it is not feasible for a staff member to a ccompany the resident to the hospital, unit staff, preferably the resident's physician or the s pecialty unit's medical director, shall communicate with a physician or another health care practitioner at the receiving hospital at the time of the transfer. (c) In either case, the staff member or physician s hall provide to the receiving hospital appropriate documentation and other information tha t may be needed at the time of transfer to ensure continuity of care. (d) The resident shall be given priority readmission status to the unit as his or her condition may warrant. (e) Program/Unit Staffing Requirements. 12 1. The facility shall maintain consistent assignmen t of direct care staff to residents who live in the unit. 2. The facility shall ensure that any direct care s taff assigned to the unit have been thoroughly trained and educated with regard to the special needs of unit r esidents, are competent to work in the unit, and are familiar to unit residents. 3. The assignment of direct care staff must be suff icient to enable timely and appropriate care as determined by resident assessment and to pr otect both resident and staff safety. In addition to the staff assigned to the unit as speci fied in this subdivision, the facility shall make available other staff as necessary for the pro vision of care and services set forth in each resident's care plan. 4. The unit shall be managed by a program coordinat or who is a licensed or certified health care professional with previous formal education, traini ng and experience in the administration of a nursing home, preferably with e xperience in a program that focuses on the care and management of individuals with Neur odegenerative Diseases. The program coordinator shall be dedicated only to the specialty unit. The program coordinator shall be responsible for the operation and oversight of the program. Other responsibilities of the program coordinator shall i nclude: (i) planning for and coordination of direct care an d services; 13 (ii) screening prospective admissions; (iii) developing and implementing in-service and co ntinuing education programs, in collaboration with the interdisciplinary team, for all staff in contac t or working with these residents; (iv) participating in the facility's decisions rega rding resident care and services that affect the operation of the unit; and (v) ensuring the development and implementation of a program plan and policies and procedures specific to this program. 5. A physician who preferably has specialized train ing in the care of individuals with Neurodegenerative Diseases shall be responsible for the medical direction and medical oversight of this program and shall assist with the development and evaluation of policies and procedures governing the provision of medical s ervices in this unit. If, at the time the physician is appointed as medical director of the u nit, he or she does not have experience in providing care to individuals with Neurodegenera tive Diseases, he or she shall have access to physicians who do have such experience. 6. A psychiatrist who preferably has clinical exper ience working with individuals who have Neurodegenerative Diseases shall be available on staff or on a consulting basis (including via telemedicine in conformance with app licable law) to the residents and to the 14 program. 7. A clinical psychologist or a licensed clinical s ocial worker who preferably has clinical experience working with individuals who have Neurod egenerative Diseases shall be available on staff or on a consulting basis (includ ing via telemedicine in conformance with applicable law) to the residents, staff and family. 8. A social worker who preferably has training and experience in caring for individuals with Neurodegenerative Diseases shall be available either on staff or on a consulting basis (including via telemedicine in conformance with app licable law) to work with the residents, staff and family as needed. 9. There shall be at least one registered professio nal nurse deployed on each shift in the unit who preferably has training and experience in caring for individua ls with Neurodegenerative Diseases. This registered nurse m ay not be the specialty unit program director required under paragraph (4) of th is subdivision. 10. A therapeutic recreation specialist certified b y a nationally recognized body acceptable to the department shall be responsible for the ther apeutic recreation program. 11. A respiratory therapist shall be available to r esidents who are no longer able to maintain normal oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. 15 (f) Program/Unit Service and Environmental Requirem ents. 1. The program shall consist of a variety of medica l, behavioral, counseling, recreational, exercise, nutritional, and other services as approp riate to the needs of each individual resident. 2. Specific services that shall be available to res idents who need them include but are not limited to: neurology; pulmonary specialist; psychotherapy; phy sical, occupational, respiratory and speech therapy; specialized eating and nutritional interventions to maximize independence and prevent unplanned weight loss and dehydration; technology to enable the resident to communicate effectively w ith family, friends, staff and other residents; and oral care. Consults as needed shall be provided by but are not limited to surgical, podiatry, optometry, ophthalmology, orthopedic, cardiac, gast roenterology; dental and hearing licensed professionals. 3.

Support groups for residents, families and staff shall be established and facilitated by the social worker or other counseling professional. 16 6. The environment shall be customized to both meet the needs and characteristics of residents and minimize injuries to residents and staff. (i) Each resident's living space shall be customize d to safely accommodate his/her specific movement and motor control characteristics and chan ges in movement and motor control characteristics as the resident's disease evolves. (ii) Such customization may include but is not limi ted to padding around hard surfaces that could harm the resident, staff or visitors; self-protecti ve equipment such as soft helmet, elbow and knee pads; broda chairs (including shower/commode, bariatric, geriatric and glider chairs) with HD special padding if needed; and adequate space to accommodate high amplitude involuntary movements without injury to either the resident, staff or visitors. (iii) The unit shall include, in their new construc tion designs, small recreational and dining room areas where residents can be with their families in privacy and comfort. (iv) Units shall include central bathing and toilet facilities that can accommodate two- person assists. In-room toilets and bathing accommodations should b e modified or restricted to ensure resident safety and privacy as described in (i) and (ii). 7. The unit shall be equipped and staff shall be tr ained as necessary for the provision and management of non-invasive ventilation for resident s for whom this service is appropriate. 17 Supervision shall be provided by a respiratory therapist and pu lmonary specialist. 8. Residents shall not be prevented from participat ing in research projects and clinical trials that have been approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB ) that is registered with the federal Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP) in the United States Department of Health and Human Services and in compliance with the human subjects research requirements at 45 CFR Part 46 as determin ed by OHRP. To the extent practicable, facilities may facilitate residents' p articipation in such research and trials by, for example, becoming trial sites, providing transp ortation to the trial site, providing assistance to enroll in the research, and working with families to facilita te participation. 9. The facility shall provide outdoor access to res idents. (g) Program/Unit Training Requirements 1. The facility shall ensure that all staff assigne d to the direct care of the residents have pertinent experience or have received training in the care an d management of people with Neurodegenerative Diseases. 2. Training shall be appropriate to the functions a nd responsibilities of specific staff in the unit and shall include but not be limited to: (i) the Neurodegenerative Disease itself, e.g., sig ns and symptoms, genetics, diagnosis, management, progression/history of the disease, pr ognosis and epidemiology; 18 (ii) how each type of staff can contribute to bette r quality of care and quality of life for resident; (iii) injury prevention for the resident, staff and visitors; (iv) creating an organized environment that minimiz es stressors, maintains routines and encourages/maximizes independent functioning and de cision-making; (v) ensuring adequate hydration and nutrition; and (vi) providing and encouraging cognitive stimulatio n and socialization through passive and active participation in appropriate activities. 3. Families and informal supports, including the re sident's friends and caregivers, shall also have access to this training as appropriate to their act ivities in the unit. 4. The facility shall ensure that educational progr ams are conducted for staff who do not provide direct care but who come in contact with the residents on a reg ular basis such as housekeeping and dietary aides. The educational programs shall familiarize staff wi th the goals of the specialty unit and the needs of reside nts with Neurodegenerative Diseases. 19 REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT Statutory Authority: Public Health Law (PHL) section 2803(2)(v) provides that the Public Health and Health Planning Council shall adopt rules and regulations, subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Health, governing the standards and procedures followed by nursing homes which, at a minimum, must meet federal standa rds. Legislative Objectives: The legislative objective of PHL Article 28 include s the protection of the health of the residents of the State through the efficient provis ion and proper utilization of health services of the highest quality at a reasonable cos t. The proposed amendments are consistent with this objective through the developm ent of specialty units designed to address the unique needs of individuals with Neurod egenerative Disease and help them maintain or attain the highest practicable level of physical, affective, behavioral and cognitive functioning. Needs and Benefits: The purpose of the proposed amendments to 10 NYCRR Part 415 is to provide regulatory standards for nursing home specialty care units for people with Neurodegenerative Diseases. The environmental and care needs for nur sing home residents with Neurodegenerative Diseases, at least before the end stages of the disease, often vary from those of other populations in need of nursing home care today. The proposed standards 20 do not codify clinical pathways and interventions a s these may change over time. Rather, they describe the service and environmental needs o f people with Neurodegenerative Diseases and the nursing home's responsibilities to meet the resident's needs as well as, to a certain extent, their families' needs. Four nursing homes have taken steps to create speci alty units for people with Neurodegenerative Diseases. Specifically, the foll owing facilities either have already established specialized care units for people with Neurodegenerative Diseases or have submitted Certificate of Need (CON) applications to do so are: Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center - an esta blished 48-bed unit in New York City; Ferncliff Nursing Home - an established 38-bed unit in Rhinebeck; Victoria Home - CON submitted for a 12-bed unit in Ossining; and Sitrin Health Care Center - CON submitted for a 32- bed unit in New Hartford These four facilities will serve as a statewide res ource for individuals with Neurodegenerative Diseases, leading to better servi ce for people living in New York and repatriation of out-of-state residents to nursing h omes that are closer to their home communities and families. For example, there are c urrently about 50 Medicaid-eligible New Yorkers with Huntington's Disease living in out -of-state nursing homes. Many of these New Yorkers would not have had to seek nursin g home care outside of New York had there been a nursing home capable of caring for them closer to their home 21 communities and families. Costs to Regulated Parties: Nursing homes are not required to implement the pro posed regulation, as the operation of specialty units is voluntary. A nursing home may i ncur costs associated with the construction of a specialty unit for individuals wi th Neurodegenerative Diseases. The Department will establish Medicaid reimbursement ra tes for nursing home providers for delivering appropriate services through the special ty units. A facility is unlikely to apply for approval to operate a specialty unit if it does not expect that doing so will be cost effective. Costs to Local Governments: Nursing homes are not required to implement the pro posed regulation, as the operation of specialty units is voluntary. To the extent a nurs ing home operated by a local government seeks approval to operate a specialty un it, the costs will be the same as for other regulated parties who operate such units. Costs to State Government: The proposed rule does not impose any new costs on state government, as regulation of specialty units will be managed as part of the Depa rtment's overall nursing home surveillance activities. 22 Local Government Mandates: The proposed amendments do not impose any program, mandate, service, duty or responsibility upon any county, city, town, village , school district, fire district or other special district. Implementation is voluntary. Paperwork: Nursing homes interested in operating a specialty u nit for individuals with Neurodegenerative Diseases would need to submit and receive approval of a CON application. In addition, nursing homes are alread y required to maintain compliance with certain reporting, record-keeping obligations and s taffing under federal and State requirements. For nursing homes interested in prov iding specialty care for Neurodegenerative Diseases, which is voluntary, the proposed regulations require additional reporting on admissions, discharges and outcomes and compliance with certain staffing requirements as necessary to meet the obje ctives of the specialty units. This additional reporting will allow the Department to a ssess compliance and implementation. Duplication: The proposed regulation does not duplicate, overlap or conflict with any other State or federal rules and regulations, but sets forth addit ional standards for care in specialty units for individuals with Neurodegenerative Diseases. Alternatives: \"Scatter beds\" as opposed to specialty unit beds we re considered but rejected. Specialty 23 units are preferable from a clinical perspective, a s they will enable residents to be cared for by an interdisciplinary care team in a customiz ed environment, and likely will be more cost effective in providing residents with the enhanced level of service required. Federal Standards: The proposed amendments exceed federal standards by setting forth additional standards for care in specialty units for individuals with Ne urodegenerative Diseases. Compliance Schedule: As implementation of the proposed amendments is vol untary, there is no compliance schedule. CON applicants will determine a complian ce schedule in conformance with the scope of changes needed in their facilities to accommodate the specialty unit regulatory requirements. Contact Person: Katherine Ceroalo NYS Department of Health Bureau of House Counsel, Regulatory Affairs Unit Corning Tower Building, Room 2482 Empire State Plaza Albany, NY 12237 (518) 473-7488 (518) 473-2019 FAX REGSQNA@health.ny.gov 24 Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for Small Businesse s and Local Governments Effect of Rule: Implementation of this rule is voluntary, subject t o submission and approval of a Certificate of Need (CON) application. It is not k nown how many small nursing homes (those with less than 100 beds) or how many nursing homes owned and operated by counties and cities will choose to implement the pr oposed regulation. Compliance Requirements: Nursing homes are already required to maintain comp liance with certain reporting, record-keeping obligations and staffing under feder al and State requirements. For nursing homes interested in providing specialty car e for Neurodegenerative Diseases, which is voluntary, the proposed regulations requir e additional reporting on admissions, discharges and outcomes and compliance with certain staffing requirements as necessary to meet the objectives of the specialty units. Thi s additional reporting will allow the Department to assess compliance and implementation. Professional Services: Implementation is voluntary. The professional staf f needed to comply with the proposed specialty unit regulations do not vary from the pro fessional staff required to comply with current nursing home rules and regulations, except that the proposed regulation expresses a preference for professional staff with experience in meeting the unique needs of individuals with Neurodegenerative Diseases. 25 Compliance Costs: Implementation of the proposed regulation is volunt ary, subject to submission and approval of a CON application. A nursing home may incur costs associated with the construction of a specialty unit for individuals wi th Neurodegenerative Diseases. The Department will establish Medicaid reimbursement ra tes for nursing home providers for delivering appropriate services through the special ty units. A facility is unlikely to apply for approval to operate a specialty unit if it does not expect that doing so will be cost effective. Economic and Technological Feasibility: The proposed regulation is economically and technic ally feasible. In particular, implementation is voluntary, and a nursing home is unlikely to propose construction and operation of a specialty unit unless it is cost-eff ective for the facility. Minimizing Adverse Impact: As implementation of the proposed rule is voluntary , a nursing home is unlikely to propose construction and operation of a specialty u nit unless it is cost-effective for the facility. Small Business and Local Government Participation: The Department of Health created a stakeholder advi sory group, which helped guide the development of the proposed regulation. The member s of this group include representatives of small businesses, specifically n ursing homes interested in serving 26 individuals with Neurodegenerative Diseases, as wel l as family members and advocates for individuals with Neurodegenerative Diseases and clinical experts with experience caring for such individuals. In addition, a copy o f this notice of proposed rulemaking will be posted on the Department's website. The not ice will invite public comments on the proposal and include instructions for anyone in terested in submitting comments, including small businesses and local governments. The proposed regulation provides that the facility shall make information and data available to assist the Department of Health in eva luating the effectiveness of specialty units and their impact on outcomes for individuals with Neurodegenerative Diseases. Such evaluation will be conducted four years after the adoption of the proposed regulations and the Department will consider whethe r changes are warranted to the programmatic requirements. This period of time is designed to ensure that there is sufficient experience to allow the Department to as sess implementation. 27 RURAL AREA FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS Types and Estimated Numbers of Rural Areas: While there are a number of nursing homes located i n rural areas throughout the State, implementation of the proposed rule is voluntary. Nursing homes in rural areas will not be affected differently than those in non-rural are as. Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requi rements and Professional Services: Nursing homes are already required to maintain comp liance with certain reporting, record-keeping obligations and staffing under feder al and State requirements. For nursing homes interested in providing specialty car e for Neurodegenerative Diseases, which is voluntary, the proposed regulations requir e additional reporting on admissions, discharges and outcomes and compliance with certain staffing requirements as necessary to meet the objectives of the specialty units. Thi s additional reporting will allow the Department to assess compliance and implementation. Costs: Implementation of the proposed rule is voluntary, s ubject to the submission and approval of a Certificate of Need application. A nursing ho me may incur costs associated with the construction of a specialty unit for individuals wi th Neurodegenerative Diseases. The Department will establish Medicaid reimbursement ra tes for nursing home providers for delivering appropriate services through the special ty units. A facility is unlikely to apply 28 for approval to operate a specialty unit if it does not expect that doing so will be cost effective. Minimizing Adverse Impact: As implementation of the proposed rule is voluntary , a nursing home is unlikely to propose construction and operation of a specialty u nit unless it is cost-effective for the facility. Rural Area Participation: The Department of Health created a stakeholder advi sory group, which helped guide the development of the proposed regulation. The group' s members are located throughout the state and include family members and advocates for individuals with Neurodegenerative Diseases, clinical experts with e xperience caring for individuals with Neurodegenerative Diseases, and representatives of nursing homes interested in serving such individuals. In addition, a copy of this noti ce of proposed rulemaking will be posted on the Department's website. The notice will invite public comments on the proposal and include instructions for anyone interested in submi tting comments, including individuals and entities located in rural areas. The proposed regulation provides that the facility shall make information and data available to assist the Department of Health in eva luating the effectiveness of specialty units and their impact on outcomes for individuals with Neurodegenerative Diseases. Such evaluation will be conducted four years after the adoption of the proposed 29 regulations and the Department will consider whethe r changes are warranted to the programmatic requirements. This period of time is designed to ensure that there is sufficient experience to allow the Department to as sess implementation. 30 STATEMENT IN LIEU OF JOB IMPACT STATEMENT No Job Impact Statement is required pursuant to sec tion 201-a(2)(a) of the State Administrative Procedure Act.

Project #161022-C Exhibit Page 1 Public Health and Health Planning Council Project # 161022-C St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center Program: Hospital County: Onondaga Purpose: Construction Acknowledged: January 14, 2016 Executive Summary Description St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center, a 431-bed, not-for-profit, acute care hospital located at 301 Prospect Avenue in Syracuse (Onondaga County), requests approval for the certification of 20 additional Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, and for the renovation of requisite space to accommodate the beds. The 20-bed unit for this project is already in operation under temporary emergency approval in the former ICU suite located on the third floor of the main hospital building. On January 15, 2015, St. Joseph's received temporary emergency approval from the Department of Health to operate an additional 14 medical/surgical beds and six ICU beds (the Unit) for a six-month period. The Unit became operational on May 15, 2015 and has been operating with approved temporary waivers. The hospital will be reque sting an extension to its temporary emergency a pproval to operate the Unit for an additional period of time while this CON application is under review and physical plant changes are made to address the temporary waivers. The hospital has been using the 14 medical/surgical beds as a Progressive Care Unit (PCU) to bridge the gap between ICU and medical/surgical unit care. PCU patients typically require higher intensity nursing care than general medical/surgical unit patients; therefore, the hospital is requesting certification of all 20 beds as ICU beds in order to give St. Joseph's the most flexibility to provide critical care services on an as needed basis.St. Joseph's is currently certified for 28 intensive care beds and will be certified for 48 as a result of this project. OPCHSM Recommendation Contingent Approval Need Summary Medical/Surgical occupancy remains high and ICU data has shown a constant increase from 2010 to 2014. The permanent certification of additional ICU beds is justified by the strong utilization. Program Summary Based on the results of this review, a favorable recommendation can be made regarding the facility's current compliance pursuant to 2802- (3)(e) of the New York State Public Health Law. Financial Summary Project costs of $614,778 will be met via equity from the hospital. The projected budget is as follows: Revenues $7,675,028 Expenses 3,420,557 Net Income $4,254,571 Project #161022-C Exhibit Page 2 Recommendations Health Systems Agency There will be no HSA recommend ation for this project.

[AER] Council Action Date April 14, 2016 Project #161022-C Exhibit Page 3 Need Analysis Background/Analysis St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center, a 431-bed not for profit located at 301 Prospect Avenue, Syracuse (Onondaga County), 13203 seeks approval for the certif ication of 20 net new Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds at the Hospital, and for the renovation of r equisite space to accommodate the beds. The 20-bed unit that is the subject of this application is already in operation on the 3rd floor of the main Hospital building under a temporary emergency approval. The emergency approval was granted for 14 medical su rgical beds and six ICU beds. The facility has been using the 14 medical surgical beds as a \"progressive care unit\", which is a unit designed to bridge the gap between intensive care and medical/surgical beds. The hospital, however, is requesting certification of all 20 as ICU beds to provide the most flexibility. Appr oval of this request will increase permanently certified ICU beds from the current 28 to 48 total, and total beds from 431 to 451. As seen in the following table, medical surgical utilization remains very high for this facility. Discharges Occupancy Beds 2011 2012 2013 2014 2011 2012 2013 2014 Medical/Surgical (includes ICU 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% High-Risk Per the table below, ICU discharges continue to rise and represent an increasing percentage of medical/surgical cases. When considering ICU utiliza tion, viewing the Average Daily Census against the current number of ICU beds (28) and ICU occupancy rates from 2011-2014 indicates rates far in excess of optimal rates. It is clear the emergency appr oved ICU beds are being utilized and will be needed going forward. Year ICU Discharges ICU as a % of all Med/Surg Discharges Average Daily Census ICU Occupancy Rates (28 beds) 2011 2,580 12.64% 30 107% Conclusion The continued rise in ICU discharges and medical/ surgical utilization shows the need for the permanent certification of these 20 ICU beds. Recommendation From a need perspective, approval is recommended. Project #161022-C Exhibit Page 4 Program Analysis Project Proposal St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center, an existing Arti cle 28 acute care hospital located at 301 Prospect Avenue in Syracuse (Onondaga County), seeks approval fo r the certification of 20 net new Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and for the renovation of requisite space to accommodate the beds. The 20-bed unit is already in operation on the 3rd floor of the main Hospital building under a temporary emergency approval. On January 15, 2015, St. Joseph's received temporary emergency approval to operate 14 medical/surgical (M/S) beds and six ICU beds for a six-month period. The Hospital has been using the M/S beds as a Progressive Care Unit (PCU), a type of unit t hat bridges the gap between intensive care units and medical/surgic al units. In order to offer the most flexibility in providing critical care services on the 20-bed unit, the Hospital is requesti ng that all 20 beds be certified as ICU beds. Prior to operating the 20-bed unit under temporary emergency approval, surgical inpatients were experiencing significant delays in being transferred to cr itical care beds and, as a result, were forced to remain in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) until a bed became available. Emergency Department (ED) patients also experienced long ED boarding times prior to being admitted. Additionally, St. Joseph's has developed strong working relationships with regi onal hospitals that no longer provide higher-level acute care services as well as being a receiving re ferral center for cardiac surgery and vascular patients. Both of these circumstances has led to the need to accommodate a growing number of critical care patients from counties outside of Onondaga County. Compliance with Applicable Codes, Rules and Regulations This facility has no outsta nding Article 28 surveillance or enfor cement actions and, based on the most recent surveillance information, is deemed to be curr ently operating in substantial compliance with all applicable State and Federal codes, rules and regulations. This determination was made based on a review of the files of the Department of Health, incl uding all pertinent records and reports regarding the facility's enforcement history and the results of routine Article 28 surveys as well as investigations of reported incidents and complaints. Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, approval is recommended.

A reduction in beds from this area would raise occupancy of remaini ng beds and put more resources in areas where SMC projects greater need in the near future. As SMC serves nearby Fort Drum which is without a hospi tal of its own, utilization of its services is greatly impacted by the needs of and fluctuations in the m ilitary population and their families. At the same time, SMC must also address the needs of the surrounding ru ral communities. This proposal will allow them to do both.

[AER] Council Action Date April 14, 2016 Project #161037-C Exhibit Page 3 Need Analysis Project Description Southampton Hospital is seeking approval to establis h an Article 28 extension clinic to be located at 740 County Road 39, Southampton, 11968, in Suffolk County . This project includes the addition of one linear accelerator. Background and Analysis The primary service area for the proposed extens ion clinic is eastern Long Island which includes the following zip codes: are currently no Article 28 linear accelerator machines located on the east end of Long Island. The closest existing Articl e 28 linear accelerator to this proposed clinic is at John T. Mather Hospital's extension clinic in East Setauket, which is 45 miles and 53 minutes away. The need methodology set forth in 10 NYCRR Sect ion 709.16 calculates the need for therapeutic radiology devices by health planning region. Departme nt regulations require that at least ninety-five percent of the total population of the Nassau-Suffolk r egion live within one hour's driving time of a LINAC. Furthermore, need for LINAC machines is determined by assuming that 60% of the cancer cases in a planning region will be candidates for radiological therapy . Of these, half will require 15 treatments a year and half will require 35. Each LINAC machine can provide 6,500 treatments per year. The table below shows a need for 16 LINAC devices (linear accelerators) in the Nassau-Suffolk health planning region: LINAC Need in Nassau-Suffolk Region Total 1 # of Cancer Cases/Year 17,741 2 60% will be Candidates for Radiation Therapy 10,644 3 50% of (2) will be Curative Patients 5,322 4 50% of (2) will be Palliative Patients 5,322 5 Course of Treatment for Curative Patients is 35 Treatments 186,276 6 Course of Treatment for Palliati ve patients is 15 Treatments 79,833 7 The Total Number of Treatments [(5)+(6)] 266,109 8 Need for LINAC Machines1 [(7)/6,500] 41 9 Existing/Approved Re sources (Upon Approval of CON 161037) 25 10 Remaining Need for LINAC Machines [(8)-(9)] 16 1Each LINAC Machine has capacity for 6,500 Treatments The Nassau-Suffolk health planning region has a total of thirteen facilities - eight hospitals and five hospital extension clinics - providing lin ear accelerator serv ices as follows: Current Resources # Facilities With LINAC Services # LINAC Machines Nassau-Suffolk Region Hospitals Hospital Clinics Total in Hospitalsin Hospital Clinics Total Nassau 5 2 7 85 1 3 Suffolk 1 3 3 6 65 1 1 Region Total 8 5 13 16 10 24 1 Includes approved resources under CON 132150 which is not yet operational. This project should lower the number of residents of the Nassau-Suffolk region who are more than an hour drive to the closest LINAC. The proposed clinic is 53 minutes driving time from the closest LINAC facility, which is located in Ea st Setauket, Suffolk County. Project #161037-C Exhibit Page 4 Conclusion There is currently no LINAC provider within the primary service area of eastern Long island. Approval of this project will provide for the continuity of care fo r cancer patients in the region by filling a void for LINAC services within eastern Long Island and the surrounding communities of Suffolk County. After approval of this project, there will still be a need for 16 additional LINAC devices in the Nassau-Suffolk planning region. Recommendation From a need perspective, approval is recommended. Program Analysis Project Proposal Southampton Hospital, an existing Article 28 facility located at 240 Meeting House Lane in Southampton (Suffolk County), seeks approval to construct an exte nsion clinic to be built at 740 County Road 39A in Southampton. The proposed 13,200 squar e foot extension clinic will be located about 1.2 miles and four minutes travel time from the hospital. The new two-story building will house the proposed Article 28 extension clinic a nd other non-Article 28 services. The Article 28 space (located in separate and distinct space from the non-Article 28 services) will provide linear accelerator and CT simulation services on the 1 st floor of the building. Non-Article 28 services within the new building will include a pr ivate practice medical oncology practice on the 2nd floor. This project will enhance the Hospital 's oncology capabilities, provide the Hospital with the ability to handle the growing demand for high-quality linear acce lerator services, and improve patient accessibility to services. Typically, patients receive linear accelera tor services several times a week for at least a couple of weeks. At present, there is no Articl e 28 linear accelerator located on the east end of Long Island and within the primary serv ice area of Southampton Hospital. Staffing will consist of 5.79 FTEs in the first year after completion and has been project to be 6.11 FTEs by the third year of operation. The site will be certified for Radiol ogy - Therapeutic and Medical Serv ices - Other Medical Specialties. Compliance with Applicable Codes, Rules and Regulations This facility has no outstanding Article 28 surveill ance or enforcement actions and, based on the most recent surveillance information, is deemed to be currently operating in substantial compliance with all applicable State and Federal codes, rules and regulations. This determination was made based on a review of the files of the Department of He alth, including all pertinent records and reports regarding the facility's enforcement history and the results of routine Article 28 surveys as well as investigations of reported incidents and complaints. Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, approval is recommended.

The Department sought applications from Article 28 general hospitals interested in initiating Transitional Care Units in accordance with the provisions of Section 2802- a of Public Health Law. Olean General Hospital is a voluntary not-for- profit, Article 28 acute care hospital located at 515 Main Street, Olean (Cattaraugus County). The facility, currently certified for 186 beds, requests approval to create a 16-bed Transitional Care Unit (TCU) through the conversion of a separate 15-bed sub-acute rehabilitation unit that the Hospital currently operates under a Swing Bed program (licensed as medical/surgical beds), and an additional medical/surgical bed from an acute care unit. The TCU unit will be located and self-contained on the third floor of the Hospital. In 2009, Upper Alleghany Health System, a not- for-profit management holding corporation, became the sole corporate member and co- established operator of Olean General Hospital. Upper Alleghany Health System is also the sole corporate member of Bradford Regional Medical Center and its controlled subsidiaries, a nearby Pennsylvania hospital and health system. OPCHSM Recommendation Contingent Approval Need Summary Section 2802-a of the Public Health Law authorizes the Commissioner to approve up to 18 general hospitals to operate TCUs on a demonstration basis. There are currently ten TCUs operating across the state. Program Summary The proposed 16-bed TCU converts an existing 15-bed Swing Bed unit already configured and operating under Medicare RUGS program. Staffing for this unit has been in place since 2006 and has developed an expertise not easily replicated in the region. Conversion of the Swing Bed Unit will result in a minimal start up period for the TCU Unit. The additional bed (one medical/surgical bed) fo r the TCU Unit will come from another acute unit so that there will be no net increase in beds. Financial Summary Project costs of $55,090 will be met with accumulated funds from Olean General Hospital. The projected operating budget is as follows: Revenues: $2,378,876 Expenses: 1,784,169 Gain: $594,707 Project #161059-T Exhibit Page 2 Recommendations Health Systems Agency There will be no HSA recommend ation for this project.

[AER] Council Action Date April 14, 2016 Project #161059-T Exhibit Page 3 Need Analysis Background Section 2802-a of the Public Health Law authorizes the Commissioner to approve up to 18 general hospitals to operate TCUs on a demonstration basis. There are currently ten TC Us operating across the state. Transitional Care Unit Purpose Section 2802-a of the PHL defines \"transitional care\" as sub-acute care services provided to inpatients of a general hospital who no longer require acute care inpatient services, but continue to need specialized medical, nursing and other hospital ancillary services and are not yet ready for discharge. TCUs should be limited in length of stay and designed to meet and resolve patients' specific sub-acute medical care needs. Discharges from these units are to be timely and appropriate. The improvement of quality outcome s for the TCU population, through the provision of appropriate services delivered in the most efficient manner, is the primary goal of the TCU demonstration program. Hospitals selected for this program will be required to demonstrate an overall decrease in length of stay, quantify the clinical benefits of the program for TCU patients, and illustrate a synergistic relationship with long term care providers in the community. Collabor ation between hospitals and nursing homes in local service areas will facilitate more efficient a llocation of patients between the two settings. In accordance with Section 2802-a of the PHL, all pr oviders applying to participate in this demonstration program must meet all Conditions of Participation (COP) for skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), as defined under Title XVIII of the Federal Social Security Ac t (Medicare). In order to qualify for Medicare certification, providers must comply with Part 415 of Title 10 of the New York Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations (10 NYCRR). As part of this demonstration program, specific State SNF regulations that may impede the development of TCUs or their ability to provi de appropriate services to patients may be subject to waiver, at the discretion of the Department. Requests for waivers will be reviewed on an individual basis. In addition, the Department will periodically request information conc erning the implementation of this section of the Public Health Law and the operation of transitional care units participating in the demonstration. Applicants must demonstrate the need for any serv ices proposed within the TCU and emphasize the benefits of such a program to a specific community, including, but not limited to, addressing the absence of sufficient post-discharge services in nursing homes and community-based care. Transitional care units should be limited in length of stay and designed to meet and resolve specific sub- acute medical care needs. The expected average length of stay for patients se rved in a TCU ranges from five to not over 21 days, following a qualifying acute care stay. TCU services will be reimbursed at the applicable Medicare per diem SNF rate. Transitional Care Unit Criteria and Requirements Section 2802-a requires that all providers applying to participate in this demonstration program meet all applicable requirements as defined under Title XVIII of the Federal Social Security Act (Medicare). Additionally, a TCU must: Have a length of stay of not less than five days and not in excess of 21 days for any individual patient; Have a pre-opening survey, separate Medicare Number, and federal skilled nursing facility (SNF) certification; Be staffed by qualified staff dedicated to the TCU; Serve patients who will benefit from active rehabilit ation. (It is expected that patients will actively participate in three hours or more of Occupat ional Therapy/Physical Therapy/Speech Therapy, every day, either three hours consecutively or in combination between rehabilitative sessions); and Project #161059-T Exhibit Page 4 Collect information and submit reports to the Department on an annual basis to demonstrate an overall decrease in length of stay; quantify the c linical benefits of the program for TCU residents; and illustrate a synergistic relationship with long term care providers. The Department will consider units with a range of bed size not to exceed 25, which adhere to the following requirements: Beds must be located at a single geographic location; and Beds must be located contiguously within a distinct unit/space within the hospital. Recommendation From a need perspective, approval is recommended. Program Analysis Background Olean General Hospital (OGH) is a member of Upper Allegheny Health System (UAHS), a two-hospital system located in the southwestern part of New York State and northwestern Pennsylvania (where Bradford Regional Medical Center (BRMC), the other hospital UAHS is located). Since November 2009, UAHS, the active parent of both OG H and BRMC has acted as a stabiliz ing platform for these two rural sister hospitals. Through common management of both hospitals, UAHS has been able to demonstrate over $4M of joint efficiencies/savings annually for the UAHS system. This coll aboration continues today. Additional efficiencies and savings as well as recapture of inpatient case volume, through such initiatives as the jointly operated cardiac catheterization la b between OGH and Kaleida Health, and the possible formal merger of OGH and BRMC to gain sole community hospital status are being pursued. These efforts will likely put the OGH average daily census a llowed in order to qualify for Swing Bed designation at risk. As a result, OGH is seeking to gain TC U designation which would obviate the need for the Swing Bed unit. The Swing Bed designation was obtained by OGH in late 2006. At that time OGH recognized the specialized needs of the sub-acute patient and estab lished the separate sub-acute rehabilitation unit. This 15-bed unit has experienced between a 12 and 14 patient average daily census over the last few years. Specialized staff have been trained over this time to care for the patients. Program Review The principal elements of the proposed TCU program are: Conversion of a 15-bed sub-acute rehabilitation unit that OGH currently operates under a Swing Bed program (licensed as medical/surgical beds) and conversion of an additional medical/surgical bed from an acute care unit, to be located in di screte space on the third floor of the hospital. Operation of the unit will: o help reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions; o enhance Olean General Hospital's ability to serve the targeted population. The patients served will include: o The most costly, complex convalescing el ders that are clinically stable and would otherwise remain in an medical/surgical bed; o those in need of coordinated multi-level rehabilitation; and o frail elders still requiring extensive follow-up. Operation of the TCU with dedicated staff with access to specialist acute care professionals. The unit will be comprised of four double-bedded rooms and eight single-bedded rooms. The TCU will focus on patients that would otherwise continue to be serv ed in medical/surgical beds. These patients will remain in the TCU for a short stay of no more than 21 day s. The TCU will focus on medically complex elderly patients who while clinical ly stable still require on- going physician oversight and the specialized services of hos pital staff. Other patients expected to be routinely admitted include Project #161059-T Exhibit Page 5 those who may need an additional few days of rehabilitation prior to discharge to home as well as those needing more extensive rehabilitation therapy prior to discharge to an acute rehabilitation facility. The TCU will be under the direct responsibility of the Hospital CEO and will include a senior team consisting of a Licensed Nursing Home Administra tor who will be employed part-time as the TCU Administrator, a Nurse with hospital experience, and a part-time Physician Medical Director. The team will also include an MDS Coordinator, Registered Nurses, Certified Nurse Aides, a Social Worker, and Activities and Therapy staff. An in terdisciplinary care team will be responsible for t he coordination and continuity of patient care. Conver sion of the Swing Bed Unit to the TCU will result in a minimal start up period for the TCU Unit. In addition, Olean General Hospital has identified: coll aborative relationships with community providers; a strategy for treating patients in t he TCU; TCU specific discharge policies; comprehensive staffing to include physician coverage; and agrees to submit clinical and operational data on at least an annual basis as defined by the Department. Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, approval is recommended. Financial Analysis Total Project Costs Total project costs for renovations and the acquisiti on of movable equipment are estimated at $55,090, broken down as follows: Renovation & Demolition $ 35,000Design Contingency 3,500 Construction Contingency 3,500 Architect/Engineering Fees 4,000 Movable Equipment 6,800 Application Fee 2,000Additional Processing Fee 290 Total Project Cost $55,090 Project costs are based on a construction start date of July 4, 2016. The Hospital will finance total project costs through accumulated funds. Operating Budgets The applicant has submitted a separate operating bud get in 2016 dollars for the conversion of the sub- acute rehabilitation unit to the TCU, for t he first and third years, as summarized below: Year One and Year Three Revenues $2,378,876Expenses Operating $1,780,469 Depreciation and Rent 3,700 Total Expenses $1,784,169 Net Income $594,707 Utilization - Patient Days 5,263 Cost Per Patient Day $339.00 Project #161059-T Exhibit Page 6 The separate TCU operating budget does not depict any additional services. Utilization for the first and third years is 100% Medicare. Expense and utilization assumptions ar e based on the historical experien ce of Olean General Hospital's inpatients who currently occupy t he sub-acute rehabilitation unit as a Swing Bed Program for rural hospitals. Revenues have been adjusted to reflect the blended rate based on the RUGS for Medicare and the expenses include the additional depreciation on total project costs. Capability and Feasibility Project cost will be satisfied by accumulated funds fr om Olean General Hospital. BFA Attachment A is the financial summary of the Hospital showing sufficient funds. Working capital will come fr om hospital operations, si nce the beds are being co nverting from Swing Beds to TCU beds. The submitted budget indicates a net income of $594 ,707 during the first and third years of operation. The Medicare revenues were based on a blend of DRGs associated with Olean General Hospital's medically complex patients and excess days these pa tients spent in the Hospital. The budget appears reasonable. As shown on BFA Attachment A, Olean General Hospital maintained a positive net asset position, working capital and net income from operations in 2013 and 2014. BFA Attachment B is the internal financial summary of Olean General Hospital as of December 31, 2015, which shows the Hospital maintained $1,670,387 net income from operations in 2015. The applicant has demonstrated the capability to proceed in a financially feasible manner. Recommendation From a financial perspective, approval is recommended.

In addition, the Department will periodically request information conc erning the implementation of this section of the Public Health Law and the operation of transitional care units participating in the demonstration. Applicants must demonstrate the need for any serv ices proposed within the TCU and emphasize the benefits of such a program to a specific community, including, but not limited to, addressing the absence of sufficient post-discharge services in nursing homes and community-based care. Transitional care units should be limited in length of stay and designed to meet and resolve specific sub- acute medical care needs. The expected average length of stay for patients se rved in a TCU ranges from five to not over 21 days, following a qualifying acute care stay. TCU services will be reimbursed at the applicable Medicare per diem SNF rate. Transitional Care Unit Criteria and Requirements Section 2802-a requires that all providers applying to participate in this demonstration program meet all applicable requirements as defined under Title XVIII of the Federal Social Security Act (Medicare). Additionally, a TCU must: Have a length of stay of not less than five days and not in excess of 21 days for any individual patient; Have a pre-opening survey, separate Medicare Number, and federal skilled nursing facility (SNF) certification; Be staffed by qualified staff dedicated to the TCU; Serve patients who will benefit from active rehabilit ation. (It is expected that patients will actively participate in three hours or more of Occupat ional Therapy/Physical Therapy/Speech Therapy, every day, either three hours consecutively or in combination between rehabilitative sessions); and Project #161061-T Exhibit Page 4 Collect information and submit reports to the Department on an annual basis to demonstrate an overall decrease in length of stay; quantify the c linical benefits of the program for TCU residents; and illustrate a synergistic relationship with long term care providers. The Department will consider units with a range of bed size not to exceed 25, which adhere to the following requirements: Beds must be located at a single geographic location; and Beds must be located contiguously within a distinct unit/space within the hospital. Recommendation From a need perspective, approval is recommended. Program Analysis Background Helen Hayes Hospital is located at 51-55 Route 9W North, West Haverstraw (Rockland County). Helen Hayes operates a 130-bed acute care hospital and a 25-bed residential health care facility (RHCF). The applicant requests approval to create a 24-bed Transi tional Care Unit (TCU) through the conversion of 18 medical/surgical beds and six physical medicine and rehabilitation (PMR) beds. Helen Hayes' 130-bed acute care hospital includes 82 physical medicine and rehabilitation beds, 18 medical/surgical beds, six coma recovery beds and 24 traumatic brain injury beds. The 82 physical medicine and rehabilitation beds qualify as an inpat ient rehabilitation facility (IRF) for Medicare reimbursement purposes. He len Hayes, as a specialty medical rehabilitation provi der to the residents of the seven-county Hudson Valley region, is equipped with the services, programs, staff, equipment and expertise to provide comprehensive rehabilitation services to patients with all disabilities and at all levels. Program Review The principal elements of the proposed TCU program are: Conversion of 18 medical/surgical beds and six physical medicine and rehabilitation beds to a 24- bed TCU, to be located in an existing, vacant unit on the first floor of the hospital. Operation of the unit will: o reduce the length of stay at the medical/surgical and PMR beds; o help reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions; o enhance Helen Hayes' ability to serve the targeted population. The patients to be served will include: o The most costly, complex convalescing el ders that are clinically stable and would otherwise remain in medical/surgical beds; o those in need of coordinated multi-level rehabilitation; and o frail elders still requiring extensive follow-up. Operation of the TCU with dedicated staff with access to specialist acute care professionals. The unit will be comprised of ten double-bedded rooms and four single-bedded rooms. The TCU will focus on patients that would otherwise continue to be serv ed in medical/surgical beds. These patients will remain in the TCU for a short stay of no more than 21 day s. The TCU will focus on medically complex elderly patients who, while clinic ally stable, still require on-going physician oversight and the specialized services of hos pital staff. Other patients expected to be routinely admitted include those who may need an additional few days of rehabilitati on prior to discharge to home, as well as those needing more extensive rehabilitation therapy prior to discharge to an acute rehabilitation facility. The TCU will be under the direct responsibility of the Hospital CEO and will include a senior team consisting of a Licensed Nursing Home Administra tor who will be employed part-time as the TCU Administrator, a Nurse with hospital experience, and a part-time Physician Medical Director. The team will also include an MDS Coordinator, Registered Nurses, Certified Nurse Aides, a Social Worker, and Project #161061-T Exhibit Page 5 Activities and Therapy staff. An in terdisciplinary care team will be responsible for t he coordination and continuity of patient care. As documented in the application, the lack of appr opriate post-discharge alternatives for intensive rehabilitation in the Hudson Valley r egion has led to the need for a TCU for this specific community. In order to meet the New York State Department of Health's primary goal for the TCU Demonstration Program - improving quality outcomes for patients with TCU conditions through the provision of restorative care to maximize the patient's level of function and independence - Helen Hayes proposes to focus its unit primarily on those rehabilitation DRG cluste rs that can lead to high levels of excess days at acute hospitals when appropriate post-discharge plac ements are not available. These rehabilitation DRG clusters are anticipated to lead to an increased demand for TCU beds as a result of the migration from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system from ICD-9 to I CD-10 and a new CMS mandate for bundled payments for hip and knee replacement surgeries. The change to ICD-10, which increased specificity of diagnoses (there are nearly five times as many diagnosis codes in ICD-10 than in ICD-9), means that patients who qualifi ed under the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS ) IRF criteria for post-acute care placement in a physical medicine and rehabilitation bed under ICD-9 may not have a qualifying diagnosis under ICD-10. This will result in Helen Hayes turning away admission referrals from other hospitals for patient s who do not meet the IRF criteria due to the unavailability of subacute beds. While the average annual occupancy percentage of Helen Hayes' existing 25-bed RHCF unit is approxim ately 85%, the unit occupancy fluctuates weekly; on numerous occasions, the occupancy percentage is over 96%, meaning that Helen Hayes must sometimes turn away referrals for subacute care. The CMS mandate, which will begin on April 1, 2016, is that hospitals in the New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA MSA, which encompasses five of the seven Hudson Valley Region counties (Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland and Westchester County), par ticipate in a 90-day bundled payment initiative for hip and knee replacement surgeries. Under that CM S initiative, the hospital in which the hip or knee replacement takes place is accountable for the costs and quality of care from the time of the surgery through 90 days post-surgery. Depending on the hospital's quality and cost performance during the episode of care, the hospital will either earn a financi al reward or be required to repay Medicare for a portion of the costs. As part of this initiative, hos pitals, physicians and other post-discharge providers are to work together to more closely coordinate care, leading to better outcomes, a better experience for the patient, and fewer complications such as preventable readmissions, infections or prolonged rehabilitation and recovery. Helen Hayes has existing collaborative relationship s with many hospitals and RHCFs in the region and has already received a memorandum of understanding (M OU) from two of those facilities, the New York State Veterans Home at St. Albans (Queens Coun ty) and the New York State Veterans Home at Montrose (Westchester County), in keeping with the st ated goals of this TCU Demonstration Program. In addition, Helen Hayes has received two letters of s upport from area hospitals, New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Good Samaritan Hospital of Suffern. Additionally, Helen Hayes Hospital has identified: co llaborative relationships with long term care, durable medical equipment, and Community providers; a sou nd strategy for treating patients in the TCU; discharge policies; appropriate staffing to include physician coverage; and an agreement to forward clinical and operational data on an annual basis as defined by the Department. Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, approval is recommended.

Transitional care units should be limited in length of stay and designed to meet and resolve specific sub- acute medical care needs. The expected average length of stay for patients se rved in a TCU ranges from five to not over 21 days, following a qualifying acute care stay. TCU services will be reimbursed at the applicable Medicare per diem SNF rate. Transitional Care Unit Criteria and Requirements Section 2802-a requires that all providers applying to participate in this demonstration program meet all applicable requirements as defined under Title XVIII of the Federal Social Security Act (Medicare). Additionally, a TCU must: Have a length of stay of not less than five days and not in excess of 21 days for any individual patient; Have a pre-opening survey, separate Medicare Number, and federal skilled nursing facility (SNF) certification; Be staffed by qualified staff dedicated to the TCU; Serve patients who will benefit from active rehabilit ation. (It is expected that patients will actively participate in three hours or more of Occupat ional Therapy/Physical Therapy/Speech Therapy, every day, either three hours consecutively or in combination between rehabilitative sessions); and Project #161069-T Exhibit Page 5 Collect information and submit reports to the Department on an annual basis to demonstrate an overall decrease in length of stay; quantify the c linical benefits of the program for TCU residents; and illustrate a synergistic relationship with long term care providers. The Department will consider units with a range of bed size not to exceed 25, which adhere to the following requirements: Beds must be located at a single geographic location; and Beds must be located contiguously within a distinct unit/space within the hospital. Recommendation From a need perspective, approval is recommended. Program Analysis Background Nyack Hospital (Nyack) is located at 160 North Mi dland Avenue, Nyack (Rockland County). Nyack, a 375-bed hospital, provides acute inpatient, critical care and ambulatory services to residents of Rockland County. Nyack has NYSDOH designations as an Area Trauma Center, a Level II Perinatal Center and a Stroke Center, as well as Joint Commission on Accredit ation of Healthcare Organi zation certification as a Joint Replacement - Hip Program and a Joint Repl acement - Knee Program. Nyack Hospital also operates a certified home health agency (CHHA), Nyack Hospital Home Care Department, which provides baseline services, home health aide, medi cal social services, medical supplies equipment and appliances, nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy and speech language pathology services to both long- and short-term patients in Rockland County. Montefiore Health System, Inc. (MHS) is the sole me mber and passive parent of Nyack. As a member of MHS, Nyack is a partner provider in the Montefio re Hudson Valley Collaborative, a performing provider system (PPS) in the New York State Delivery Syst em Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) Program. Working with its partner providers of Hudson Valle y hospitals, diagnostic and treatment centers, nursing homes, community-based programs an d other organizations, the PPS is championing new models of providing individuals with high-quality care, while reducing expenditures through enhanced care coordination, community-focused care and education. Nyack will leverage its collaborative relationships with the other partners in the PPS to facilitate the dev elopment of short- and l ong-term complex care to patients in the appropriate, least-restrictive environment, including RHCFs and community-based services. Program Review The principal elements of the proposed TCU program are: Conversion of 16 medical/surgical beds to 16 transitional care beds to be located on the 4 th floor of the Maze Building. Operation of the unit will: o reduce the length of stay in the medical/surgical beds; o help reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions; o enhance Nyack Hospital's ability to serve the targeted population. The patients to be served include: o the most costly, complex convalescing el ders that are clinically stable and would otherwise remain in an medical/surgical bed; o those in need of coordinated multi-level rehabilitation; and o frail elders still requiring extensive follow-up. Operation of the TCU with dedicated staff with access to specialist acute care professionals. The unit will be comprised of 16 single-bedded rooms. Project #161069-T Exhibit Page 6 The TCU will focus on patients that would otherwise continue to be serv ed in medical/surgical beds. These patients will remain in the TCU for a short stay of no more than 21 day s. The TCU will focus on medically complex elderly patients who, while clinic ally stable, still require on-going physician oversight and the specialized services of hos pital staff. Other patients expected to be routinely admitted include those who may need an additional few days of rehabilitati on prior to discharge to home, as well as those needing more extensive rehabilitation therapy prior to discharge to an acute rehabilitation facility. The TCU will be under the direct responsibility of the Hospital CEO and will include a senior team consisting of a Licensed Nursing Home Administra tor who will be employed part-time as the TCU Administrator, a Nurse with hospital experience, and a part-time Physician Medical Director. The team will also include an MDS Coordinator, Registered Nurses, Certified Nurse Aides, a Social Worker, and Activities and Therapy staff. An in terdisciplinary care team will be responsible for t he coordination and continuity of patient care. In addition, Nyack Hospital has identified: collaborati ve relationships with community providers; a defined strategy for treating patients in the TCU; purposeful discharge pol icies, adequate staffing to include physician coverage, and committed to reporting required st atistics to the Department on an annual basis. Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, approval is recommended. Financial Analysis Total Project Costs Total project costs for renovations and the acquisiti on of movable equipment are estimated at $1,764,440, broken down as follows: Renovation & Demolition $1,070,196 Design Contingency 107,020 Construction Contingency 107,020 Architect/Engineering Fees 85,563Other Fees (Consultant) 25,000 Movable Equipment 358,000 Application Fee 2,000Additional Processing Fee 9,641 Total Project Cost $1,764,440 Project costs are based on a construction start dat e of September 1, 2016 and a nine-month construction period. Nyack Hospital will finance total project costs as follows: Accumulated funds from the Foundation $176,444 Capital Lease (60 months, 1.962%) $1,587,996 The accumulated funds are from t he Nyack Hospital Foundation. T he Foundation has submitted a letter stating that they are willing to prov ide the necessary funds for this proj ect. BFA attachment C shows that Nyack Hospital Foundation has sufficient equity. The Capital Lease is for related construction and movable equipment. A draft lease proposal has been submitted by the applicant from Pantheon Capital for a 60-month period at a monthly lease rate factor of .01962. BFA Attachment B shows the net present va lue of the lease payments over the 60 months (5- year term). Project #161069-T Exhibit Page 7 Operating Budgets The applicant has submitted an incremental operating budget in 2016 dollars, for the first and third years of operation, summarized below: Year One Year Three Revenues $3,023,790 $3,191,778 Expenses $2,719,441 $292,061 Patient Days 5,256 5,548 Cost Per Day $552.60 $522.66 Utilization for the first and third years is 100% Medi care. Expense and utilization assumptions are based on the historical experience of Nyack Hospital inpatients. Capability and Feasibility Project costs of $1,764,440 will be met with a capital lease of $1,587,996 and $176,444 in accumulated funds from the Nyack Hospital Foundation. BFA A ttachment C presents the financial summary of the Foundation showing sufficient funds. Working capital of $483,286 based on two months of third year expenses will come from hospital operations. The submitted incremental budget indicates a net income of $119,347 and $292,061 during the first and third years of operation, respec tively. The Medicare revenues were based on a blend of DRGs associated with NH medically complex patients and ex cess days these patients spent in the Hospital. The budget appears reasonable. Nyack Hospital experienced negative working capital, maintained a positive net asset position, and net loss from operations of $2,206,736 as of November 31, 2015. The applicant indicated that the negative working capital and net operating losses are due to the following facts: Nyack Hospital is a safety net provider with a high percentage of Medicaid, uninsured and Medicaid dual-eligible patients. Declines in Medicaid reimbursement and volume changes had a negative impact on net patient revenues, which contributed to the Hospital's net operating losses. BFA Attachment D is Nyack Hospital's 2014-2015 statistica l report, which supports that their payor mix is predominantly governmental payors. The facility' s Medicaid and uninsured discharges accounted for 40% of all discharges in 2015, which was up from 36% all discharges in 2014. Nyack Hospital has been working on reducing thei r working capital deficit by cost savings and increasing patient revenues. As shown on their 2014 -2015 financials, the working capital deficit has been reduced by $2,623,505. Based on preceding and subject to the noted cont ingencies, the applicant has demonstrated the capability to proceed in a financially feasible manner. Recommendation From a financial perspective, contingent approval is recommended.

These applications are in response to the Public Health and Health Planning Council's directive at their October 6, 2011 meeting, for the competing local area hospitals to develop a collaborative PCI/Cath Lab solution to serve Niagara County's residents. NFMMC is a 171-bed, voluntary, acute care hospital located at 621 Tenth Street, Niagara Falls (Niagara County). The other three hospitals are all located in Erie County. There are currently no Cath Labs in Niagara County. NFMMC policies, procedures, and Medical Staff Bylaws will govern the activities of the Cath Lab, and the financial operations, including producing the related financial st atements, will be fully integrated within the financial system of NFMMC. The Cath Lab's finances will be managed through a dedicated Joint Venture Fund (JV Fund) and operating expenses, as approved by the Governing Body, will be funded through the JV Fund. Capital costs approved by the Governing Body will also be addressed through the JV Fund. An agreed-upon Dispute Resolution Procedure is provided for in the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA). Operational revenues and expenses will be shared 30:30:30:10, with ECMC holding the 10% share as delineated in the JOA. The proposed project will not result in a major increase in patient volume, but will provide a change in service location to improve patient access by bringing care closer to the patients. The two Delivery System Reform Incentive Program (DSRIP) Performing Provider Systems (PPS) in Western New York (WNY), Millennium Collaborative Care and Community Care Partners of WNY, are working collaboratively to address DSRIP's Improve Cardiovascular Health Project (Project 3.b.i.) and support the project.

NFMMC is a Level 1 Perinatal Center and a Stroke Center. Upon approval, Niagara Falls Memorial Medical Center will add the following ce rtified services to its operating certificate: Cardiac catheterization - adult diagnostic; Cardiac catheterization - percu taneous coronary intervention; 15.3% of New York State residents live below the fe deral poverty level. Niagara County has 13.7% and the City of Niagara Falls 24.9%. According to the NYS Poverty Report released by the New York State Community Action Association in March 2013, the poverty rate in the City of Niagara Falls for African- Americans is nearly twice as high as the Caucasian poverty rate. The number of Niagara Falls residents living in poverty has grown by 2% since the 2000, a significant percentage when put in context of the city's overall population decline of 9% since 2000. Currently, Niagara County residents must leave t heir home county and travel significant distances to access cardiac catheterization services in either Er ie County or outside of Western New York. Typically, 125 minutes lapse between the times a Niagara County resident experiences the signs of a heart attack and when the patient can begin to receive treatment at an Erie County-based facility. During inclement weather, the interval may stretch to 155-160 minut es. The timeline exceeds the national standard for providing an intervention. Distance is not the only barrier to timely services . A large percentage of households in Niagara County have no access to a motor vehicle and rely on alternative modes of travel, such as walking and public transit. Placing a cath lab in the heart of the co mmunity could prevent unnecessary transfers out of Niagara County and bring cardiac care closer to ho me. Niagara's catheterization patients would be able to receive care in their home county and stay connect ed to their cardiologists and primary care physicians after the procedure. A review of health status indicators for Niagara County reveals several underlying problems: The percentage of obese adults is 31.3% comp ared to a rate of 24.9% for New York State. The percentage of cigarette smoking among adults is 20.6% in Niagara County versus 17.6% in New York State (exclusive of NYC). The age-adjusted percentage of adults with physi cian diagnosed angina, heart attack or stroke is 41% higher in Niagara County than the statewide rate; 10.7% in Niagara compared to 7.6% in New York State. Niagara County has a 34% rate of hypertension as compared to a New York State rate of 26.8%. Analysis The Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory project has three major aims: Eliminate barriers to care through the operati on of a Niagara County-based cardiac catheterization laboratory; Improve the management of heart disease through the use of best practices; Wage a strong and sustained campaign to prevent heart disease. NFMMC, Mercy, and Kaleida will each appoint three representatives and ECMC will appoint one representative to a Clinical Committ ee which will provide clinical direct ion to and oversight of cardiac catheterization laboratory activities, including qua lity assurance, utilization review and the coordination and integration of services. Projects 152231-C/152232-C/152234-C/1 52245-C: Exhibit Page 8 The planning area for PCI capable catheterization labor atories is one hour average surface travel time. Volume Requirements per regulation: o Section 709.14(d)(1)(ii)(c): All PCI capable cardia c catheterization laborat ory centers must yield 36 emergency PCI procedures per year within the fi rst year of operation and at least 200 total PCI cases per year within two years of start-up. The standard will be met: It is projected there will be 152 emergency PCI procedures performed in the first year of the Lab's operations and 562 PCI procedures perf ormed in the third year of operation. Both the number of emergency PCls and total PCI cases will exceed the above referenced minimums. o Section 709. 14(d)(1)(ii)(k): Where public need is es tablished herein, priority consideration shall be given to applicants that can demonstrate proj ected volume in excess of 300 PCI cases per year. This standard will be met: Projected volume is 562 PCI cases in the third year of operation. Heart disease is the number one cause of death in Ni agara County (Vital Statistics Data, March 2014). Niagara County's age-adjusted cardiovascular disease rate per 100,000 residents is 287.8 versus a New York State rate of 234.6/100,000. The county has the f ourth highest cardiovascular disease mortality rate in the state. In 2010, the PCI volume for residents of Niagara Count y was 670 procedures. While by 2014, the volume of procedures had declined by 20 percent to 536, t here are still over 530 Niagara County residents, annually, traveling to Erie County and beyond to seek treatment. The addition of this lab to Niagara Falls Memorial Medical Center will allow residents to stay in the area.

Existing referral patterns indicate the additional service will not jeopardize the ability of surrounding facilities to maintain the requisite minimum volume. Currently, there are three hospitals licensed to perform PCI procedures in the Western region to of these, only one, Olean General Hospit al, is not meeting the PCI volume standard of 300 procedures per year. However, this facility is lo cated outside the one hour travel minimum and therefore does not impact consideration of this application.

Conclusion The goal of the 709.14 cardiac services need methodology is to maintain provider volumes associated with high quality outcomes and avoid the unnecessary duplic ation of services. This application meets the necessary requirements outlined in the methodology and will bring a needed service to the area. Niagara County's African-American and Medicaid populations are undertreated and underse rved. Operation of a cardiac catheterization laboratory at NFMMC will cl ose disparity gaps, providing access to life-saving diagnostic and therapeutic treatment. Recommendation From a need perspective, approval is recommended. Program Analysis Program The proposed project will improve pati ent access to se rvices by bringing care closer to patients. Providing catheterization services at NFMCC will redu ce the time it takes for Niagara County residents to be connected to services from a current interval of 125 to 155+ minutes down to approximately 90 minutes\u2014closer to the national standard for the ti mely provision of cardiac catheterization care. The proposed full-service cardiac surgery backup fac ilities for NFMMC are positioned in Buffalo. Mercy Hospital, located at 565 Abbott Road (24.9 miles/38 minutes from NFMCC) and Buffalo General Medical Center, located at 100 High Street (22.7 miles/34 mi nutes from NFMCC), both have extensive experience operating Cath Labs and will ensure the safe and effi cient operation of this new diagnostic and PCI- capable cath lab. Upon approval, the NFMCC site located at 621 Tenth Street in Niagara Falls will be certified for: Cardiac Catheterization- Adult Diagnostic; and Cardiac Catheterization - Percutane ous Coronary Intervention (PCI) Staffing at NFMMC will increase by 10. 8 FTEs the first year after comple tion and is anticipated to remain at that level through the third year of operation. The Applicant has submitted a written plan that demon strates their ability to comply with all of the standards for PCI Capable Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories and they have assured the Department that their program will meet all of the r equirements of 409.29(e)(1 ) and 409.29(e)(2). Projects 152231-C/152232-C/152234-C/1 52245-C: Exhibit Page 10 The NYS Cardiac Advisory Committee (CAC) met on July 20, 2015 and unanimously recommended APPROVAL of this project (with stipulated condi tions) based on need of underserved population and conditions of weather causing travel in excess of an hour. Compliance with Applicable Codes, Rules and Regulations This facility has no outsta nding Article 28 surveillance or enfor cement actions and, based on the most recent surveillance information, is deemed to be curr ently operating in substantial compliance with all applicable State and Federal codes, rules and regulations. This determination was made based on a review of the files of the Department of Health, incl uding all pertinent records and reports regarding the facility's enforcement history and the results of routine Article 28 surveys as well as investigations of reported incidents and complaints.

Total Project Cost and Financing Total project costs for renovations and the acqui sition of moveable equipment are estimated at $2,177,027, broken down as follows: Renovation & Demolition $408,000 Design Contingency 40,000 Construction Contingency 44,800Planning Consultant Fees 8,000 Architect/Engineering Fees 50,000 Movable Equipment 1,612,330CON Application Fee 2,000 CON Processing Fee 11,897 Total Project Cost $2,177,027 Project costs are based on a start date of July 1, 2016, with a seven-month construction period. The project will be financed by accumulated funds. The percentages and amounts to be funded by the respective parties are as follows: NFMMC 30% $217,703. In addition, NFMMC has submitted a grant request through the NYS Capital Restructuring Finance Program for $1. 08 million. If funding is awarded, grant proceeds will be used to help offset the cost of the Cath Lab equipment. BFA Attachments A through D are, respectively, the co-operators' 2014 certified financia l statements and internal financial statements as of August 31, 2015, which shows sufficient re sources to meet the equity requirement. Operating Budget The applicant has submitted their first and third y ear operating budgets, in 2016 dollars, as summarized below: Year One Year Three Inpatient Revenues $4,242,782 4,511,805 4,857,268 Income or (Loss) $99,219 $1,054,141 Utilization (Inpatient Discharges) 370 441 Utilization (Outpatient Visits) 556 661 Cost Per Inpatient Discharge $6,894.28 $6,788.48 Cost Per Outpatient Visit $8,114.76 $7,348.36 *Other operating income is compris ed of electrocardiogram, lab, x-ray, and stress test for cardiac cath outpatients. Utilization by payor source for the first and third years is ant icipated as follows: Inpatient Total 100.00% 100.00% Revenue assumptions are based on current Medicare and Medicaid rate methodologies, while Commercial and all other payers are based on the co-operators' experience. BFA Attachment E is the anticipated inpatient and outpatient ca ses further classified into Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG). Expense assumptions are based upon the historical experience of the co- operators' identifiable costs. The breakeven point is expect ed to be close to the first y ear's budgeted utilization. Utilization assumptions are based on a change in servic e location, which is expected to improve patient access bringing care closer to Niagara County resid ents. At the present time, Niagara County does not have a facility that offers cardiac catheterization services, causing area residents to travel outside the community. The applicant expects the budgeted cases to come primarily from Kaleida and Mercy, with minimal to no impact on each facility. Capability and Feasibility Total project costs of $2,177,027 will be satisfied from the co-operators' accumulated resources. Based on the co-operators' percentage inte rest in the JOA, project investment is expected be as follows: $217,703. NFMMC has submitted a grant request through the NYS Capital Restructuring Finance Program for $1.08 million. If grant funds are awarded, they will be used to help offset the co-operators' investment in the Cath Lab equipment. Working capital requirements are estimated at $1,308, 498 based on two months of third year expenses, which will be funded from the participants' accumulate d resources. It is estimated that NFMMC will provide $741,816 of the working capital ($498,953 fo r inpatient and $242,863 or 30% of the outpatient needs). The remaining $566,682 in outpatient working capital will be funded as follows: CHS 30% or $80,956. Review of BFA Attachments A though D, the 2014 certified and internal financial stat ements as of August 31, 2015, shows sufficient resources to meet the total equity requirement. Projects 152231-C/152232-C/152234-C/1 52245-C: Exhibit Page 13 The submitted budget projects net income of $99,219 and $1,054,141 for the first and third years, respectively. BFA Attachment E is the anticipated inpatient and outpatient cases, further classified by ICD-9 Classification and CPT Codes, along with the ant icipated revenues. BFA Attachment F shows total equity of $3,485,525 as the first day of operations , further broken down by co-operator BFA Attachment G shows the proposed allocation of Year One and Year Three surpluses. The budget appears reasonable. Review of BFA Attachments A through D, the co -operators' 2014 certified and internal financial statements as of August 31, 2015, shows the facilities had an average positive working capital position and generated an average positive oper ating income. The facilities had positive net assets with the exception for Mercy Hospital of Buffalo, which had an $8,004,000 negative position that resulted from a change in the pension obligation, other than net periodic cost. It is expected t hat the net asset position will resolved itself as the facility has generated an average operating income of $15,412,817 from 2013 through August 31, 2015. The applicants point out that the cooperative effo rt between the Cath Lab co-o perators furthers their corporate and social missions, an d is supported by the two area PPSs , Millennium Collaborative Care and Community Partners of WNY, to address DSRIP goals of improving cardiovascular health in Niagara County.

The projected budget is as follows: Revenues $1,766,023 Expenses 814,288 Net Income $951,785 Project #152356-E Exhibit Page 2 Recommendations Health Systems Agency There will be no HSA recommend ation for this project. Office of Primary Care and Health Systems Management Approval of a two-year extension of the operating certificate from the date of the Public Health and Health Planning Council recommendation letter, contingent upon: 1. Submission of a signed agreement with an outside, independent entity, acceptable to the Department, to provide quarterly reports to DOH following the completion of each quarter of operation. Reports will be due within 60 days of t he conclusion of each quarter as identified by the Effective Date on the Operating Ce rtificate issued at project completion. Reports must include: a. Actual utilization including procedures; b. Breakdown of visits by payor source; c. Percentage of charity care provided by visits; d. Number of patients who needed follow-up care in a hospital within seven days after ambulatory surgery; e. Number of emergency transfers to a hospital; f. Number of nosocomial infections recorded; g. A brief list of all efforts made to secure charity cases; and h. A brief description of the progress of contract negotiations with Medicaid managed care plans. [RNR] Approval conditional upon: 1.

The submission of quarterly reports to the Departme nt, as prescribed by the related contingency, for the duration of the limited life appr oval of the facility. [RNR] Council Action Date April 14, 2016 Project #152356-E Exhibit Page 3 Need Analysis Analysis The primary service area is Rockland County. T he applicant had projected 573 procedures for Year 3 of the original CON 091059, but performed only 211. The table below provides a projected and actual breakdown of procedures by payor, as well as projections for the first year a fter approval of the current CON. 091059 Projected Year 3 (2013) 091059 2013 Actual 2014 Actual 152356 Projected (Year Per the FASC's establishment CON, Medicaid and Charity Care were projected to be 2% and 3%, respectively, of total procedures in the first and th ird years of operation. The applicant acknowledges the annual Medicaid and Charity Care utilization combined has been consistently below 1% and recognizes that the Center has not reached a desirable level of ca re to underserved populations during the initial five- year limited life. The applicant indicated the facilit y struggled for three years to secure a Medicaid provider number, which significantly hampered its ability to provide care to Medicaid patients. Staff verified that a request for Medicaid enrollment was received by the Department on November 11, 2010, and that the Department notified the Center of their enrollment confirmation (retroactive to June 14, 2010) via a letter dated November 15, 2013. Due to the delay, the applicant indicated that the Center has been actively pursuing Medicaid referrals for only two (2) years and was only recently able to complete the Medicaid managed care plan contracting process that began after it received its Medicaid provider number. The applicant indicated that the FASC provided only pl astic surgery services throughout its limited life, with only one surgeon performing the plastic surgery procedures. Although the Center was approved to add ophthalmology effective February 11, 2014, the serv ice has not been fully implemented. The Center projects 50 ophthalmology procedures in Year One and 75 in Year Three, and anticipates that this service will enhance the Center's ability to attract and care fo r Medicaid and Charity Care patients. Advanced Surgery Center, LLC is committed to serving indivi duals needing care regardless of the source of payment or the ability to pay. To improve their efforts in r eaching the underserved, the applicant has proposed the following: The Center has secured Medicaid managed care contra cts with Fidelis Care Plan, Affinity Health Plan and Hudson Health Plan. The Center reaches out on a regular basis to Nyack Hospital and Good Samaritan Hospital in an effort to obtain reconstructive surgery and ophthal mology Medicaid and Charity Care referrals from the hospitals' emergency departments. Copies of the outreach letters have been provided as documentation. The center will be meeting with Refuah Health Center , a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), in an effort to increase additional underinsu red patient referrals to the center. Project #152356-E Exhibit Page 4 Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, acce ss to healthcare coverage has improved in New York State, which means fewer people needing traditional char ity care. The delay this center faced in being certified for Medicaid until November 2013 prevented the center from serving this population of patients. The center has increased their Medicaid utilization to 1.75 percent in 2015. The center also added a surgeon to provide ophthalmology services, in February 2014. Ba sed upon these circumstances, approval for an additional two year s of limited life is recommended. Conclusion Extending the limited life will allow the applicant additional time to reach the underserved population in the communities of Rockland County. Recommendation From a need perspective, contingent approval is recommended, with a two year extension of their operating certificate. Program Analysis Program Proposal Advanced Surgery Center, LLC, an existing Article 28 multi-specialty diagnostic and treatment center certified as a dual single-specialty freestanding ambula tory surgical center, located at 150 South Pearl Street in Pearl River (Rockland County), requests pe rmission for a two year ex tension of their operating certificate (initially granted via CON #091059B).

[AER] Council Action Date April 14, 2016 Project #161001-B Exhibit Page 3 Need Analysis Background and Analysis The primary service area of the proposed facility encompasses Middletown, Otisville and Cuddebackville in Orange County, which includes the zip codes of 10940, 10963 and 12729. The secondary service area includes all of Orange County. The population of Orange County in 2010 was 372,813. Per projection data from the Cornell Program on Applied Demographi cs, the population of Orange County is estimated to grow to 413,327 by the year 2025. The Middletown Service Area is designated a Medica lly Underserved Area/Population (Source-HRSA): Prevention Quality Indicators-PQIs PQIs are rates of admission to the hospital for c onditions for which good outpatient care can potentially prevent the need for hospitalization, or for which ea rly intervention can prevent complications or more severe disease. The table below shows that the PQI rates are signifi cantly higher for the service area than for New York State as a whole.

[AER] Council Action Date April 14, 2016 Project #152263-B Exhibit Page 4 Need Analysis Analysis The population of Erie County in 2014 was 922,835. The table below shows the portion of the County population belonging to two groups statistically more likely to need end stage renal dialysis and compares it with the rest of the State. Erie County New York State Ages 65 and over: 16.5% 14.7% Non-white: 23.6% 43.5% Source: U.S. Census 2014 Capacity The Department's methodology to estimate capacity for chronic dialysis stations is specified in Part 709.4 of Title 10 and is as follows: One free standing station represents 702 proj ected treatments per year. This is based on the expectation that the center will operate 2.5 patient shifts per day at 6 days per week, which is 15 patients per week, per station [(2.5 x 6) x 52 we eks] equals 780 treatments per year. Assuming a 90% utilization rate based on the expected number of annual treatments (780), the projected number of annual treatments per free standing station is 702. The estimated average number of dialysis procedures each patient receives from a free standing station per year is 156. One hospital based station repres ents 499 projected treatments per year. This is based on the expectation that the hospital will operate 2.0 patient shifts per day at 6 days per week, which is 12 patients per week, per station [(2 x 6) x 52 week s] equals 624 treatments per year. Assuming an 80% utilization rate based on the expecte d number of annual treatments (6 24), the projected number of annual treatments per hospital station is 499. O ne hospital based station can treat 3 patients per year. Per Department policy, hospital-based stations ca n treat fewer patients pe r year. Statewide, the majority of stations are free standing, as are the ma jority of applications for new stations. As such, when calculating the need for additional stations , the Department bases the projected need on establishing additional free standing stations. There are currently 216 free-standing chronic dialys is stations operating in Erie County and 13 in pipeline for a total of 229. Based upon DOH methodology, the 216 existing free standing stations in Erie County could treat a total of 972 patients annually. Including the additional 13 pipeline stations, the county could treat a total of 1,030 patients annually. Need Projections Actual Projected Erie County Residents 2014 2015 2019 Need projected 5 years out from most current IPRO data available for Patients Treated in County Total Patients Treated in County Total County Residents in Treatment Total Patients Treated in County1 Total County Residents in Treatment1 1,320 1,219 1,531 1,372 Free-Standing Dialysis Stations 2014 2015 2019 A Stations Required to Treat2 294 271 341 305 B Existing Stations 216 216 216 216 C Stations In Pipeline 13 13 13 13 D Stations Requested this CON 13 13 13 13 E w/Approval of This CON (B+C+D) 242 242 242 242 F Unmet Need With Approval (A-E) 52 29 99 63 1 Based upon an estimated 3% accrued annual increase 2 Based upon DOH methodology (total patients/4.5) Project #152263-B Exhibit Page 5 The data in the first row, \"Free Standing Stations Needed,\" comes from the DOH methodology of each station being able to treat 4.5 patients, and each ho spital station being able to treat 3 patients annually. The data in the next row, \"Existing Stations,\" comes from the Departm ent's Health Facilities Information System (HFIS). \"Unmet Need\" comes from subtractin g needed stations from existing stations. Patient and resident data are from IPRO. The applicant estimates that the facility will provide 2, 151 chronic renal dialysis treatments in Year 1 and 6,406 dialysis treatments in Year 3 of operations. Conclusion This project will increase the number of approved free-s tanding dialysis stations in Erie County from 229 to 242. The additional stations will help to redu ce the unmet need for dialysis services among County residents. Recommendation From a need perspective, approval is recommended.

Del Castillo, MD (20%) Disclosure information was also submitted and reviewed for the Medical Director. Dr. Maria Concepcion V. Del Castillo is board-certified in Internal Medi cine and Nephrology and has extensive experience with the renal population. Dr. DelCastillo completed a Fe llowship in Nephrology at North Shore University Hospital (Manhasset) and has admitting privileges at Millard Filmore Hospital, Kenmore Mercy Hospital, South Buffalo Mercy Hospital and Degraff Memorial Hospital. Staff from the Division of Certification & Surveilla nce reviewed the disclosu re information submitted regarding licenses held, formal education, training in pertinent health and/or related areas, employment history, a record of legal actions, and a disclosure of the applicant's ownership interest in other health care facilities. Licensed individuals were checked against the Office of Medicaid Management, the Office of Professional Medical Conduct, and the Educat ion Department databases as well as the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General Medicare exclusion database. Additionally, the staff from the Division of Certificat ion & Surveillance reviewed the ten-year surveillance history of all associated facilities. Sources of info rmation included the files, records, and reports found in the Department of Health. Included in the review were the results of any incident and/or complaint investigations, independent professio nal reviews, and/or comprehensive/focused inspections. The review found that any citations were properly corrected with appropriate remedial action. The members of LEDP II, LLC disclosed the following : In March 2007, Nephrology Associates of WNY, LLP became aware of a billing erro r involving the drug Ar anesp. The Group invest igated the billing error and completed a full audit. Subsequently, the Group self-reported to Medicare through the (Buffalo area) US Attorney General's Office and the matter was settled. The officers of U.S. Renal Care (USRC) disclosed that U.S. Renal Care acquired Dialysis Corporation (DCA) in June 2010, however, in February 2 010, DCA had been subpoenaed by the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Heal th and Human Service (OIG) with respect to an investigation relating to alleged improper Medicare an d Medicaid billing at certain DCA clinics. The investigation related to two qui tam suits with the Department of Justice and private litigants. USRC denied any impropriety or liability by DCA in both case s, but determined that it should settle those cases with the government and private litigants which it did in May 2013 and September 2014. Both suits have been dismissed. No non-DCA facilities owned by USRC we re involved in the investigations and litigation. Star Ratings - Dialysis Facility Compare (DFC) The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servic es (CMS) and the University of Michigan Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center have developed a methodol ogy for rating each dialysis facility which may be found on the Dialysis Facility Compare (DFC) websit e as a \"Star Rating.\" The method produces a final score that is based on quality meas ures currently reported on the DF C website and ranges from 1 to 5 stars. A facility with a 5-star rating has quality of ca re that is considered 'muc h above average' compared to other dialysis facilities. A 1- or 2- star rating does not mean that a facility provides poor care. It indicates only that measured outcomes were below av erage compared to other facilities. Star ratings on DFC are updated annually to align with the annual updates of the standardized measures. The DFC website currently reports on nine measures of qua lity of care for facilities. The measures used in the star rating are grouped into three domains by us ing a statistical method known as Factor Analysis. Each domain contains measures that are most correl ated. This allows CMS to weight the domains rather than individual measures in the final score, limiting the possibility of overweighting quality measures that assess similar qualitie s of facility care. Project #152263-B Exhibit Page 7 To calculate the star rating for a facility, each dom ain score is calculated by averaging the normalized scores for measures within that domain. A final score between 0 and 100 is obtained by averaging the three domain scores (or two domain scores for perit oneal dialysis-only facilities). Finally, facilities are awarded stars as delineated below. Facilities with the top 10% final scores are given 5 stars. Facilities with the next 20% highest final scores are given 4 stars. Facilities within the middle 40% of final scores are given 3 stars. Facilities with the next 20% lowest final scores are given 2 stars. Facilities with the bottom 10% fi nal scores are given 1 star. U.S. Renal Care, Inc. operates over 190 dialysis c enters in the nation and has indirect ownership in three centers located in New Yo rk State's Erie County.

Project #152263-B Exhibit Page 9 Operating Budget The applicant submitted an operating budget, in 2015 dollars, for Years One and Three of operations, summarized below: Year One Year Three Per Treatment Total Per Treatment Total Revenues Medicare FFS broken down by payor source during years one and three is as follows: Year One Year Three Treatments % Treatments % Medicare 669 31.10% 2,057 596 4.18% Pay 1.35% 89 1.39% 178 2.78% Total 2,151 100.00% 6,406 100.00% The following is noted with respect to the submitted budget: Revenues are based on the bundled ESRD rate of $250 per treatment for Medicaid and Medicare patients, while the commercial rate is based on USRC's local contracts within the Buffalo market. Expenses are based on current market rates in the area and USRC's contracted rates and average clinical utilization for such services including: medication and medical supplies, utilities, equipment and professional fees. Utilization is based on USRC's sta ndard utilization methodology for opening a new dialysis facility in a region, which includes conservative estimates during the initial start-up period. Breakeven utilization is 48. 68% or 5,923 treatments. The budget is reasonable. Capability and Feasibility Project costs of $1,818,147 will be met via members' equity of $181,815, an intercompany loan from USRC for $1,291,332 at the above stated terms, and a $345,000 construction al lowance provided by the landlord. Working capital requirements are estimated at $347,095, wh ich is equivalent to two months of Year Three expenses. The applicant indicated they will prov ide $575,000 towards working capital, which is approximately $227,905 over the estimated working c apital equity requirement. The members will provide equity equivalent to their ownership perc entages. USRC's equity portion is $235,332 and will Project #152263-B Exhibit Page 10 come from operations. LEDP II, LLC equity por tion is $192,543 and will co me from the members' personal net worth. The remaining $147,125 will be provided through an intercompany loan from USRC at an interest rate of prime (3.5% as of February 5, 2016) with a five-year term. A letter of interest has been provided by USRC for the proposed working capital financing. BFA Attachment A is the personal net worth statements of the members of LEDP II, LLC, which indicates sufficient liquid resources to cover all equity requirements associated with this CON. BFA Attachment C is the 2013-2014 certified and internal financial statements of U.S. Renal Care, Inc. as of November 30, 2015, which indicate the entity maintained positive working capital and net asset positons for the period, and generated net inco me of $48,652,324 in 2014 and $42,065,066 through November 30, 2015. During 2013, US Renal Care, Inc. incurred a loss of $428,918. The loss was due to a one-time transaction for early retirement of debt tr ansaction expenses. Without this transaction, the facility would have achieved break even for 2013. As shown above, USRC has sufficient liquid resources available to cover their portion of both equity requirements and to provide the funding for both intercompany loans. BFA Attachment D is the pro forma balance sheet of USRC West Cheektowaga, LLC d/b/a U.S. Renal Care West Cheektowaga Dialysis as of the first day of operation, which indicates the operation will begin with a positive members' equity of $575,000. The submitted budget indicates a net loss of $607,60 3 and a net income of $153,604 for Year One and Year Three, respectively. Revenues are based on th e current reimbursement methodologies for dialysis services. The Year One loss is due to the start-up of operations and will be covered by U.S. Renal Care, Inc. through a revolving credit agreement. The submitted budget is reasonable. BFA Attachment E is the financial summaries of U.S. Renal Care, Inc.'s three affiliated New York dialysis centers for the period 2013 through November 30, 20 15, which shows that each facility had a positive working capital positions, positive net asset positi ons and operating surpluses for the period 2013-2014.

USRC Williamsville, Inc. and USRC Cheektowaga, Inc. ha d negative working capital positions and operating deficits of $255,084 and $297,662, respectively; however, both entities had positive net asset positons for the period. The negat ive working capital positions were due to negative intercompany payables which misstated the current assets. The net losses were due to out-of-period allocated administrative costs of $487,973 and $855,382, respectively. Without these transactions, both companies would have had a positive working c apital position and positive net income. Subject to the noted contingencies, the applicant ha s demonstrated the capability to proceed in a financially feasible manner.

[AES] Council Action Date April 14, 2016 Project #152313-B Exhibit Page 3 Need Analysis Analysis The primary service area for the proposed facilit y is Queens County, which had an estimated population of 2,321,580 for 2014. The table below shows the portion of the county population belonging to two groups statistically more likely to need end stage renal di alysis and compares it with the rest of the state. Queens County New York State Ages 65 and over: 13.6% 14.7% Non-white: 50.9% 29.1% Source: U.S. Census 2015 Capacity The Department's methodology to estimate capacity for chronic dialysis stations is specified in Part 709.4 of Title 10 and is as follows: One free standing station represents 702 proj ected treatments per year. This is based on the expectation that the center will operate 2.5 patient shifts per day at 6 days per week, which is 15 patients per week, per station [(2.5 x 6) x 52 we eks] equals 780 treatments per year. Assuming a 90% utilization rate based on the expected number of annual treatments (780), the projected number of annual treatments per free standing station is 702. The estimated average number of dialysis procedures each patient receives from a free standing station per year is 156. One hospital based station repres ents 499 projected treatments per year. This is based on the expectation that the hospital will operate 2.0 patient shifts per day at 6 days per week, which is 12 patients per week, per station [(2 x 6) x 52 week s] equals 624 treatments per year. Assuming an 80% utilization rate based on the expecte d number of annual treatments (6 24), the projected number of annual treatments per hospital station is 499. O ne hospital based station can treat 3 patients per year. Per Department policy, hospital-based stations ca n treat fewer patients pe r year. Statewide, the majority of stations are free standing, as are the ma jority of applications for new stations. As such, when calculating the need for additional stations , the Department bases the projected need on establishing additional free standing stations. There are currently 525 free standing chronic dialys is stations operating in Queens County and 170 in pipeline for a total of 695 stations. Based upon DOH methodology, the 525 existing free standing stations in Queens County could treat a total of 2,633 patients annually. Including the additi onal pipeline stations, the county could treat a total of 3,128 patients annually.

The data in the next row, \"Existing Stations,\" comes from t he Department's Health Facilities Information System (HFIS). \"Unmet Need\" comes from subtracting needed stations from existing stations. \"Total Patients Treated\" is from IPRO data from 2015. Conclusion Queens County serves a population of 2,321,580 with a total of 695 stations, including pipeline stations. There continues to be a need for additional dialysis st ations in Queens County. Approval of these fifteen stations will improve access to di alysis services in the area. Recommendation From a need perspective, approval is recommended.

[RNR] Council Action Date April 14, 2016 Project #142145-E Exhibit Page 5 Need Analysis Project Description Ross Acquisition, LLC, doing business as Ross Health Care Center, seeks approval to become the established operator of Ross Health Care Center, a 135-bed Article 28 residential health care facility (RHCF), located at 839 Suffolk Avenue, Brentwood, 11717, in Suffolk County. Analysis The Need methodology indicates a need for 2,003 beds in the Nassau-Suffolk Region as noted below. However, as shown on the chart below, utilization ha s been below optimal (97%) for over seven years. RHCF Need - Nassau-Suffolk Region 2016 Projected Need 16,962 Current Beds 15,352 Beds Under Construction -393 Total Resources 14,959 Unmet Need 2,003 The overall occupancy for Suffolk Coun ty was 91.9% for 2014 as noted below: *unaudited, based on weekly census According to the applicant, the facility experienced lo w occupancy as a result of being a small facility relative to other facilities in the local planning area and the need for flexibility in pairing roommates due to an increase in short term rehabilitative stays. The applicant intends to increase occupancy in the following ways: Decertify 15 beds; Keep in line with the Department's goals of provid ing long-term care in the most integrated setting as possible through: o Implementation of Institutional Sp ecial Needs Plan (I-SNP) services; o Development of new and enhancement of existi ng care programs, including its Wound Care Program and Short-Term Rehabilitation Services; and o Partnerships with hospitals, managed care plans and other long-term providers; 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Facility vs. County vs. Region Project #142145-E Exhibit Page 6 Transform the care model to ensure residents served by the facility are those truly in need of level of care being provided at the RHCF; and Collaborate with the local area hospitals to ensure prompt discharge of hospital patients appropriate for RHCF care and implement state of the art progra ms to both reduce and avoid re-hospitalization, both at a significant cost saving to the Department. Access Regulations indicate that the Medicaid patient admissions standard shall be 75% of the annual percentage of all Medicaid admissions for the long term care planning area in which the applicant facility is located. Such planning area percentage shall not in clude residential health care facilities that have an average length of stay 30 days or fewer. If there are fo ur or fewer residential health care facilities in the planning area, the applicable standard for a planning area shall be 75% of the planning area percentage of Medicaid admissions, or of the Health Sy stems Agency area Medicaid admissions percentage, whichever is less. In calculating such percentages, the De partment will use the most current data which have been received and analyzed by the Department. An applicant will be required to make appropriate adjustments in its adm ission policies and practices so that the proportion of its own annual Medicaid patient 's admissions is at least 75% of the planning area percentage or the Health Systems Agenc y percentage, whichever is applicable. Ross Health Care Center's Medicaid admissions of 33.0% in 2012 and 26.6% in 2013 exceeded the Suffolk County 75% rates of 21.1% in 2012 and 19.4% in 2013. Conclusion The decertification of 15 beds will help move the fa cility and planning region toward optimum utilization. Recommendation From a need perspective, contingent approval is recommended.

Project #142145-E Exhibit Page 11 Utilization by payor so urce is as follows: Current Year One Medicaid 81.18% 78% 75% at 96.95 and 93.68% for the first and third years, respectively. Capability and Feasibility The originally purchase price for the operating asse ts was $1,875,000; however , due to the bed reduction the purchase price was revised to $0. Concurrently, Ross R ealty Acquisition, LLC, will purchase the real property for $15,000,000 funded by $3,000,000 in member s' equity and a loan at the above stated terms. Greystone Funding Corporation has provided a letter of interest. There are no project costs associated with this application. The working capital requirement is estimated at $2,2 20,048 based on two months of first year expenses. Funding will be as follows: $1,110,024 from the member s' equity with the remaining $1,110,024 satisfied through a five-year loan at 6% interest rate. Gr eystone Funding Corporation has provided a letter of interest. BFA Attachments A and B, proposed members' net worth summaries for the operating and realty entities, respectively, reveals sufficient resources to meet equi ty requirements overall. However, liquid resources may not be available in proportion to the proposed ownershi p interest in the operating and realty entities. Proposed realty members Bent Philipson (on behalf of Philipson Family LLC) and Benjamin Landa have provided affidavits stating they are willing to contribute resources to the operating entity to the extent required, as well as any needed equity to the realty entit y, disproportionate to their membership interest in Ross Realty Acquisition, LLC. Further, Mr. Philipso n and Mr. Landa have submitt ed affidavits stating that they recognize that any debt guarantee or equity pay ment made as part of this project does not grant them ownership interest in the operating entity, and it is understood that no operational control can be gained or exerted as a result of such arrangement. The submitted budget projects net income of $282, 209 and $836,188 in the first year and third years, respectively. Revenues are expected to increase by approximately $840,023 conc urrent with a slight decrease in overall utilization. It is expected that there will be an approximately 3% shift from Medicaid utilization to Medicare while maintaining the current Medicare rate. Expenses are projected to increase by $44,267 in Year One. The budget was determi ned taking into consideration the proposed new owners' experience in oper ating similar-sized facilitie s. BFA Attachment D is Ross Acquisition, LLC d/b/a Ross Center for Nursing and Rehab ilitation's pro forma balance sheet, which shows the entity will start with $1,160,789 in equity (including a small am ount of equipment/inventory). The budget appears reasonable A transition of nursing home (NH) residents to M edicaid managed care is currently being implemented statewide. Under the managed care construct, Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) will negotiate payment rates directly with NH providers. A department policy, as described in the \"Transition of Nursing Home Benefit and Population into Managed Care Poli cy Paper,\" provided guidance requiring MCOs to pay the benchmark Medicaid FFS rate, or a negotiate d rate acceptable to both plans and NH, for three years after a county has been deemed mandatory fo r NH population enrollment. As a result, the benchmark FFS rate remains a viable basis for assessing NH revenues through the transition period. BFA Attachment E, financial summary of Ross Health Care Center, indicates that the facility has a negative working capital position, a negative equity position and generated an average operating loss of $415,768 for the 2013-2015 period. BFA Attachment F, financial summary of the proposed members' affiliated RHCFs, shows the facilitie s have maintained positive net inco me, positive working capital and positive net assets. Peninsula Nursing and Rehab ilitation Center's working capital position turned positive in 2015 on $1,785,655 operating net income. Seagate Rehabilitation and Nursing Center, which was acquired December 11, 2014, incurred a negative working capital position, but generated an operating surplus of $2,932,562 as of October 31, 2015 (internal financi al statements). The Pavilion at Project #142145-E Exhibit Page 12 Queens for Rehabilitation and Nursing, which was acquired December 5, 2014, had a negative working capital position due to a short-term loan to a re lated party, but generated an operating surplus of $6,024,857 as of November 30, 2015 (i nternal financial statements). Based on the preceding, the applicant has demonstrated the capability to proceed in a financially feasible manner. Recommendation From a financial perspective, contingent approval is recommended.

Project #151054-E Exhibit Page 10 Project Review This application proposes to establish River Valley Operating Associates, LLC as the new operator of River Valley Care Center. The facility will be operat ed as The Grand Rehabilitation and Nursing at River Valley. No changes in the program or physical environment are proposed in this application. Strauss Ventures, LLC was formed for the purpose of representing Jeremy and Me ryl Strauss' ownership interest in healthcare related entities. Jeremy Strauss is CEO and 95% owner of The Grand Healthcare System (The Grand), which provides administrative services (payroll, billi ng, accounts payable) as well as cl inical and administrative consulting services to health care facilities. Meryl Strauss owns the remaining 5% of the Grand. It is the intent of the proposed operators to c ontract with The Grand for general admini strative services (payroll, billing, accounts payable) as well as clinical and administrative consulting services. It should be noted that The Grand does not have any direct ownership interest in t he operations of residential health care facilities in New York State, nor is it proposed th rough this application that it will have a direct ownership interest in this facility. Despite the common ownership of it s members, the facility will be a wholly independent and distinct legal entity, in no way controlled by The Grand. Guilderland Center Rehabilitation & Extended Care Facility (Guilderland Center) was designated as a CMS Special Focus Facility in July of 2015 based on a poor surveillance history. In October of 2014 Jeremy Strauss came into the existing ownership struct ure at 9% as allowed under PHL 2801a-(4)(b)(ii). Mr. Strauss became a member of the operating LLC, instead of a consultant, in order to have decision making power and authority over operati ons at the facility. He became ac tive in facility operations in May of 2015 to help stabilize the facility and bring in additional resources, including consulting services from The Grand Healthcare System. In response to the Special Focus designation Mr. Strauss instituted numerous changes at the facility. These changes in clude but were not limited to: replacement of the administrator and director of nursing; replacement of the clinical staff; replacement of the RN Unit managers; and hired additional full time staff su ch as a staff educator, QAPI nurse, housekeeping director, maintenance director, and MDS coordinat ors. He also invested $2.2 million to address conditions at the facility. This included: installin g a state of the art wander guard and resident monitoring system; installing security cameras; new rehabilit ation room; renovated resident common areas; replaced resident beds; replaced lighting throughout the buildi ng; and installed TVs and phones at each resident bedside. Mr. Strauss has submitted CON#151090 to establish a new ownership group at the facility which will make him the primary and managing member. Conclusion No negative information has been received concerni ng the character and competence of the proposed applicants. All health care facilities are in substantial compliance with all rules and regulations. The individual background review indicates the applicants have met the standard for approval as set forth in Public Health Law \u00a72801-a(3). Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, c ontingent approval is recommended.

Operating Budget The applicant has provided an operating budget, in 2016 dollars, for the current year and year one subsequent to change of ownership, summarized as follows: Current Year (2014) Year One RHCF Per Diem Total Diem Total 87.38% 97.00% Utilization by payor source for the RHCF beds for 2014 and the first year after the change in operator is as follows: Payor Current (2014) Year One Medicaid MC FFS 9.45% 9.45% Private Pay 4.15% 4.15% The operating budget for the 30- slot ADHCP is as follows: ADHCP Current (2014) Year One $615,191 Expenses Net Income ($558,535) Per Visit $183.43 $118.23 The ADHCP visits were 100% Medicaid in 2014 and w ill be 100% Medicaid during the first and third year after the change in ownership. Project #151054-E Exhibit Page 13 The combined revenues and expenses for t he RHCF and ADHCP services are as follows: Combined Current (2014) Year One Revenues $13,888,857 $14,341,423Expenses 16,560,777 14,229,868 Net Income ($2,671,920) $111,555 The following is noted with respect to the submitted budget: Revenue assumptions are based on the facility's hi storical rate data by payor, as the applicant anticipates these rates will be held for a period of ti me going forward. The applicant states that their business model includes flexibility to transition to a Value Based Payment System prior to the end of the three year transition window. Expense assumptions are based on the facility's prio r year expenses, taking into consideration the following projected expense reductions: o Salary and related employee benefits expenses are being reduced by $1,223,960 and $511,901, respectively, related to a reduction in FTEs. Aides/Orderlies will decrease by 17.8 FTEs, RNs will decrease by 6.0 FTEs, and environ mental/food service staff will decrease by 10.3 FTEs. The staffing reductions are mitigated by an increase in FTEs for other direct care staff, including the addition of 1.5 FTEs for PT, 2 FTEs for OT, and 1 FTE for Speech Therapy. o Professional fees are being reduced by $91,050. o Medical & surgical supplies expens es are being reduced by $48,499. o Non-surgical supplies will be reduced by $107,308. Utilization is projected to increase to 97% duri ng the first year after the change in operator. The facility achieved occupancy of 84.8% in 2013 and 87. 38% in 2014. The applicant indicated that the increase from 2013 to 2014 was attributable to the operational consulting services of Jeremy Strauss which began on October 1, 2014. Upon approval of the new operator, Jeremy Strauss will have an active role as a managing member of the facility and will ensure that the operational changes implemented to date that resulted in the increa se in occupancy will continue going forward. Breakeven occupancy is 96.0% (56,064 nursing facility patient days). The facility is projecting to improve operations of the ADHCP via an increase in ADHCP visits. Capability and Feasibility The purchase price for the acquisition of the operat ing interests is $1,000,000 plus the assumption of liabilities. The applicant has already pa id the $1,000,000 toward the purchase. Working capital requirements are estimated at $2,356,056, which appears reasonable based on two months of first year expenses. The applicant will fin ance $1,178,028 at an interest rate of 5% for a five- year term. The applicant submitted a letter of interest in regard to the financing. The remaining $1,178,028 will be met via equity from the proposed me mbers. BFA Attachment A is the personal net worth statements of the proposed me mbers of River Valley Operating Associates, LLC, which indicates the availability of sufficient funds to meet the wo rking capital equity requirement. Jeremy Strauss provided an affidavit stating that he will contribute equity disproportionate to his ownership interest for the working capital portion. BFA Attachment C is the pro forma balance sheet as of the first day of operation, which indicates a positive net asset position of $2,17 8,028. Assets include $816,521 in goodwill, which is not a liquid resource, nor is it recognized for Medica id reimbursement. If goodwill is eliminated from the equation, the total net assets would be a positive $1,361,507. The submitted budget projects a net income of $111,555 during the first year after the change in operator. The applicant indicated their business model includes flexibility to transition to a Value Based Payment System prior to 2020, however their budget revenue assumptions were based on the facility's historical experience, as they anticipate the various payor rates will continue for a period of time going forward. Projected utilization by payor conforms to histor ical experience. The budget appears reasonable. A transition of nursing home (NH) residents to M edicaid managed care is currently being implemented statewide. Under the managed care construct, Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) will negotiate payment rates directly with NH providers. A department policy, as described in the \"Transition of Nursing Home Benefit and Population into Managed Care Poli cy Paper,\" provided guidance requiring MCOs to Project #151054-E Exhibit Page 14 pay the benchmark Medicaid FFS rate, or a negotiate d rate acceptable to both plans and NH, for three years after a county has been deemed mandatory fo r NH population enrollment. As a result, the benchmark FFS rate remains a viable basis for assessing Medicaid NH revenues through the transition period. BFA Attachment B is the financial summary of River Valley Care Center, Inc. from 2012 through 2014. As shown, the entity had an average positive working capital position and an average negative net asset position from 2012 through 2014. Also, the entity in curred average net losses of $3,426,999 from 2012 through 2014. The applicant indicated that the reason for the losses from 2012 through 2014 were the result of low occupancy. The low occupancy was attr ibuted to the poor ratings in quality measures due to a number of survey deficienc ies the facility received. To improv e operations, the facility corrected all deficiencies and sought out services from a consulti ng firm, which began on October 1, 2014. Since the consulting firm's involvement, the applicant indicated that facility has seen an increase in occupancy up to 97.5% through June 30, 2015. BFA Attachment E is the internal financial statement s of River Valley Care Center as of September 30, 2015. As shown, the entity had a positive working capital position and a negative net asset position for the period. Also, the entity incurred a loss from operations of $1,518,124 through September 30, 2015. BFA Attachment D is the 2012-2014 financial summaries of Jeremy Strauss' affiliated nursing homes. As shown, the facilities have maintain ed a positive net asset position, pos itive working capital position and a positive income from operations for the period show n, with the exception of Queens Center for Rehabilitation, Dutchess Center, Bushwick Cent er, Chittenango Center and Richmond Center, which had negative working capital positions due to vacation and sick time accruals and pending CMI adjustments. Financial statements for Washington Center for Reha bilitation, Essex Center for Rehabilitation, Steuben Center for Rehabilitation and Guilderland Center R ehabilitation and Extended Care are not available as the facilities were newly acquired in 2014. Subject to the noted contingency, the applicant has demo nstrated the capability to proceed in a financially feasible manner. Recommendation From a financial perspective, contingent approval is recommended.

[RNR] Council Action Date April 14, 2016 Project #151090-E Exhibit Page 5 Need Analysis Analysis There is currently a need for 25 beds in Albany County as indicated in the table below: RHCF Need - Albany County 2016 Projected Need 1,844 Current Beds 1,819 Beds Under Construction 0 Total Resources 1,819 Unmet Need 25 The historical occupancy for Guilderland Center is co mpared to that of Albany County in the chart below: *unaudited; facility reported data The applicant attributes the low occupancy during 2012 - 2014 to ineffective management and systematic deficiencies. In October 2014, the proposed managi ng member, Jeremy Strauss, became a 9% member of the current operator. As a result, additional market ing initiatives were implemented and the facility has become more engaged with hospital discharge plann ers and community resources. Occupancy increased to 95.2% in 2015. In addition to the new marketing initiatives and in creased engagement with hospital discharge planners and community resources, new programs are being im plemented to serve higher acuity residents while also preventing avoidable hospital admissions and readm issions. New programs include: tracheostomy care, cardiac rehabilitat ion, enhanced wound care, IV therapy and complex clinical care services. The following physical improvements have been made to the facility: 80 new electr ic beds, updated, state of the art rehabilitation room and flooring replacement of carpet in resident hallw ays. Staff competencies were assessed and where indicated, incompetent staff were terminated and replaced as appropriate. The following improvements are in pr ocess or will be created: installation of direct dial telephones, flat- screen televisions and furniture in resident rooms, upgrade of call bell system and replacement of dining 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015* Facility vs. Albany County Project #151090-E Exhibit Page 6 room furniture and equipment. The facility has hosted visits with hospital discharge planners from area hospitals to provide the opportunity to observe changes at the facility. Access Regulations indicate that the Medicaid patient admissions standard shall be 75% of the annual percentage of all Medicaid admissions for the long term care planning area in which the applicant facility is located. Such planning area percentage shall not in clude residential health care facilities that have an average length of stay 30 days or fewer. If there are fo ur or fewer residential health care facilities in the planning area, the applicable standard for a planning area shall be 75% of the planning area percentage of Medicaid admissions, or of the Health Sy stems Agency area Medicaid admissions percentage, whichever is less. In calculating such percentages, the De partment will use the most current data which have been received and analyzed by the Department. An applicant will be required to make appropriate adjustments in its adm ission policies and practices so that the proportion of its own annual Medicaid patient 's admissions is at least 75% of the planning area percentage or the Health Systems Agenc y percentage, whichever is applicable. Guilderland Center's Medicaid admissions for 2012 and 2013 are 14.8% and 14.7%, respectively. This facility exceeded the Albany County 75% rates in 2012 and 2013 of 10.7% and 11.3%, respectively. Conclusion Contingent approval of this application will result in the continuation of a needed resource for the residents of Albany county. Recommendation From a need perspective, contingent approval is recommended.

Senior Care Emergency Ambulance Services, Inc. Washington Center Adult Home Project #151090-E Exhibit Page 10 Project Review This application proposes to establish Guilderland Operator, LLC as the new operator of Guilderland Center Rehabilitation & Extended Care Facility. The facility will be operated as The Grand Rehabilitation and Nursing at Guilderland. No changes in the prog ram or physical environment are proposed in this application. Jeremy Strauss is CEO and 95% owner of The Grand Healthcare System (The Grand), which provides administrative services (payroll, billi ng, accounts payable) as well as cl inical and administrative consulting services to health care facilities. The current operator contracts with The Grand and it is the intent of the proposed operator to continue to contract with The Grand for general administr ative services (payroll, billing, accounts payable) as well as clinical and ad ministrative consulting services. It should be noted that The Grand does not have any direct ownership in terest in the operations of residential health care facilities in New York State, nor is it proposed throug h this application that it will have a direct ownership interest in this facility. Despite the common owners hip of one of its members, the facility will be a wholly independent and distinct legal entity, in no way controlled by The Grand. Jeremy Strauss came onto the existing ownership stru cture of Guilderland Center in October of 2014 as a 9% member as allowed under PHL 2801a-(4)(b)(ii). Coming in as a member of the operating LLC, instead of as a consultant, allowed Mr. Strauss to have decision making power and authority over operations at the facility. He became active in facility operations in May of 2015 and started initiating modifications to bring about positive institutional c hange. In July of 2015 the facility was designated Special Focus Program based on a poor surveillance history from previous years. Mr. Strauss continued to initiate change at the facility in order to address the Special Focus designation. These changes include but were not limited to: replacement of the administr ator and director of nursing; replacement of the clinical staff; replacement of the RN Unit managers; and hi red additional full time staff such as a staff educator, QAPI nurse, housekeeping director, maintenance director, and MDS coordinators. He invested $2.2 million to address conditions at the facility. This included: installing a state of the art wander guard and resident monitoring system; installing security ca meras; new rehabilitation r oom; renovated resident common areas; replaced resident beds; replaced li ghting throughout the building; and installed TVs and phones at each resident bedside. Conclusion No negative information has been received concerni ng the character and competence of the proposed applicants. All health care facilities are in substantial compliance with all rules and regulations. The individual background review indicates the applicants have met the standard for approval as set forth in Public Health Law \u00a72801-a(3). Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, c ontingent approval is recommended.

Letters from two NYS realtors have been provided attesting to the reasonableness of the per square foot rental. Project #151090-E Exhibit Page 13 Operating Budget The applicant has provided an operating budget, which is reasonable, in 2016 dollars, for the current year and year one subsequent to the change in ownership, summarized below: Current Year (2014) Year One Per Diem Total Per Diem Total 77.8% 97.0% The following is noted with respect to the submitted budget: Revenue assumptions are based on t he facility's current pay ment rates. For Medicaid, the rate is based on the current operator's 2015 Medicaid Regional Pricing rate, which is applicable for Medicaid Managed Care payments during the transition period. The rates for all other payors were determined based on the facility's average 2014 per diem pay ment rates for the respective payors. Expense assumptions are based on the historic al experience of the current operator. Utilization assumptions are based on the facility' s current 2015 occupancy rates. The applicant indicated that occupancy was at 94.96 % as of 9/30/2015. Utilization by payor source is ex pected as follows for year one: Medicaid Fee-For-Service Pay 5.26% Breakeven utilization is projected at approximately 93.4% for Year One. Capability and Feasibility There are no project costs associated with this application. The purchase price of $4,671,938 for operations will be met as shown above. Concurre ntly, 428 Route 146, LLC, will purchase the real property for $1,913,720 will be funded as shown above. Working capital requirements are estimated at $1,389, 031 based on two months of year one expenses, of which $703,546 will be satisfied from the proposed members' equity and $685,485 will be financed by a working capital loan at 5% interest for five years. Greystone has provided a letter of interest for the proposed working capital financing. BFA Attachment A is the net worth statement for the proposed owners of the RHCF, which shows sufficient resource s available to cover the purchase price and working capital equity requirements for this project. BFA Attachment B is the pro-forma balance sheet as of the first day of operation, which indicates a positive members' equity of $3,003,546. It is noted t hat assets include $2,300,000 in goodwill, which is not an available liquid resource, nor is it recogniz ed for Medicaid reimbursement purposes. Excluding goodwill, the net asset position would be a posit ive members' equity position of $703,546. Project #151090-E Exhibit Page 14 The submitted budget projects a net income of $316,808 in Year One after the change in operator. The budget is reasonable. The applicant states that their business model does not include flexibility to transition to a Value Based Payment System, as the timeframe for the implement ation of a Value Based payment system remains uncertain. Therefore, for the current CON project their revenue assumptions are based on the historical rate data of the facility, as they believe these rate s will be held for a period of time going forward. A transition of nursing home (NH) residents to M edicaid managed care is currently being implemented statewide. Under the managed care construct, Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) will negotiate payment rates directly with NH providers. A department policy, as described in the \"Transition of Nursing Home Benefit and Population into Managed Care Poli cy Paper,\" provided guidance requiring MCOs to pay the benchmark Medicaid FFS rate, or a negotiate d rate acceptable to both plans and NH, for three years after a county has been deemed mandatory fo r NH population enrollment. As a result, the benchmark FFS rate remains a viable basis for assessing Medicaid NH revenues through the transition period. BFA Attachment C is the 2013 and 2014 certifi ed and the 1/1/2015-9/30/2015 internal financial statements for Guilderland Center Rehabilitation and Extended Care Facility. The facility generated an average operating loss of $991,595, and had both av erage negative net asset and working capital positions. The applicant indicated that the losses for 2013 and 2014 were due to low occupancy rates attributable to ineffective management and systemic defici encies. In order to turn this around, the facility implemented new marketing initiatives and increase d their engagement with ho spital discharge planners and community resources. The facility has also implemented new programs in order to serve higher acuity residents and has focused on reducing prev entable/avoidable hospital admissions and readmissions. The impact of the new initiatives can be seen in 2015, with the significant reduction in net losses, the working capital loss increase is due to t he overall cost of implementing the new initiatives. BFA Attachment E is the financial summaries of t he members' affiliated nursing homes, which shows that the facilities have maintained a positive net asset po sition, positive working capi tal position and a positive income from operations for the period shown, with t he exception of Queens Center for Rehabilitation and Bushwick Center, which had negative working capital positions due to vacation and sick time accruals and pending CMI adjustments. Subject to the noted contingencies, the applicant ha s demonstrated the capability to proceed in a financially feasible manner. Recommendation From a financial perspective, contingent approval is recommended.

[RNR] Council Action Date April 14, 2016 Project #152227-E Exhibit Page 5 Need Analysis Analysis The need methodology indicates a need for 52 additional beds in Columbia County. RHCF Need - Columbia County 2016 Projected Need 667 Current Beds 596 Beds Under Construction 19 Total Resources 615 Unmet Need 52 The overall occupancy for Columbia County is 90. 5% for 2014 as indicated in the following chart: *unaudited; facility reported data The applicant attributes the decline in occupancy to the pending sale of the facility, a process which has been visible to the community given the county is the current operator. In 2014, Columbia County approved and released the RFP to privatize Pine Haven Home. During this time, there was opposition to the privatization on the part of the union representing county employ ees which generated negative press and a public campaign against the sale. The applican t states this resulted in community instability and decreased occupancy at the facility. Once the contract of sale was executed on August 24, 2015, the proposed operator engaged in meaningful and positive dialogue with facility staff and began providing consulting services. Consulting services consisted of proposed impr ovements, updated billing practices, staff training and other critical assistance including implementation of a new admissi ons program and the hiring of additional admissions screeners as well as improved relati onships with local hospitals and other upstream pr oviders. The proposed operator's involvement in Pine Haven Home since late August 2015 has resulted in community stabilization and an increase in occupancy at the fac ility from 85.6% in August to 93.7% for the period of October 28, 2015 through February 17, 2016. Current CMI for the facilit y, effective July 1, 2015, is 1.1286 and, for the Medicaid-only population, 1.0924. This is a 22.9% increase from 0.9182 for the facility CMI and a 30.3% increase from 0.8385 for t he Medicaid-only population as of July 1, 2013. 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015* Facility vs. County Project #152227-E Exhibit Page 6 The applicant intends to increase occupancy in the following ways: Keep in line with the Department's goals of provid ing long-term care in the most integrated setting as possible through: o Development of new and enhancement of existi ng care programs, including its Wound Care Program and short-term rehabilitation services; and o Partnership with hospitals, managed care plans and other long-term providers; Transform the care model to ensure residents served by the facility are truly in need of the level of care being provided at the RHCF; Collaborate with the local area hospitals to ensure prompt discharge of hospital patients appropriate for RHCF care and implement state of the art progra ms to both reduce and avoid re-hospitalization, both at a significant cost savings to the Department; Hold meetings with local community leaders, hospitals and physicians to determine community and medical needs to develop specific prog rams and services for the facility; Employ the operator's internal corporate clinical team of experts to implement any and all of the identified needed specialties; and Utilize the operator's internal team of reimburse ment experts to set up systems and procedures to guarantee the facility is up to date with the latest regulation and compliance rules. Access Regulations indicate that the Medicaid patient admissions standard shall be 75% of the annual percentage of all Medicaid admissions for the long term care planning area in which the applicant facility is located. Such planning area percentage shall not in clude residential health care facilities that have an average length of stay 30 days or fewer. If there are fo ur or fewer residential health care facilities in the planning area, the applicable standard for a planning area shall be 75% of the planning area percentage of Medicaid admissions, or of the Health Sy stems Agency area Medicaid admissions percentage, whichever is less. In calculating such percentages, the De partment will use the most current data which have been received and analyzed by the Department. An applicant will be required to make appropriate adjustments in its adm ission policies and practices so that the proportion of its own annual Medicaid patient 's admissions is at least 75% of the planning area percentage or the Health Systems Agenc y percentage, whichever is applicable. Pine Haven Home's Medicaid admissions of 14.5% in 2012 and 26.8% in 2013 did not exceed the Columbia County 75% rate of 30.8% in 2012 but did exceed the 75% rate of 25.9% in 2013. Conclusion Approval is recommended as there is a continued ne ed to strengthen the existing resources for the residents of Columbia County. Recommendation From a need perspective, contingent approval is recommended.

Medicaid revenues include the facility's current operating and capital components based on the 2015 Medicaid rate plus assessments. Project #152227-E Exhibit Page 12 Private Pay/Other revenues are pr ojected based on the payment rates for similar facilities in the same geographical area and increased by 2. 5% per annum for inflation.

The real property will be purchased for $6,500,000 wi th proposed realty mem bers' equity of $325,000 and a loan for $6,175,000 financed at 7% interest with a fi ve-year term. BFA Attachment A is a summary of the net worth of the proposed member s, which indicates the availability of sufficient funds. A letter of interest has been submitted from Capital Funding, LLC for the loan. Working capital requirements are estimated at $1, 982,322 based on two months of the first year budgeted expenses. Working capital will be met with a loan for $633,000 at 5% for a 5-year term and members' equity of $1,349,322. Capital Funding, LLC ha s submitted a letter of interest for the working capital loan. Proposed member, Jonathan Bleier, of Pine Haven Operating, LLC, has submitted an affidavit that states that he is willing to cont ribute resources disproport ionate to his ownership percentages toward working capital requirements. BF A Attachment A is a summary of the net worth of the members of Pine haven Operating , LLC , which indicates the availability of sufficient funds for working capital. BFA Attachment B is the pro-fo rma balance sheet of Pine Haven Operating , LLC as of the first day of operations, which indicates po sitive members' equity of $2,038,700. The submitted budget indicates a net profit of $765,571 for year one after the change in ownership. BFA Attachment E shows the variance between the curren t year net operating loss of $2,224,790 and the first year budget net operating profit of $765,571 is explained as follows: Revenue enhancements due to an increase in the current CMI, Medicare and Commercial Insurance rates and Medicare and Commercial days - $1,284,148; Expense reductions due to no public union employee benefit contracts, gro up purchasing discounts, group therapy contracts, new vendors and group insurance policy savings - $1,213,056; and The remaining $493,157 is based on an increase in utilization. DOH staff notes that the increase in utilization can not be taken into account as fully recognized by the applicant, since it has not occurred prior to PHHP C approval. Therefore the budgeted revenues would decrease by $493,157 resulting in a net profit in year one of $272,414. BFA Attachment F is a budget sensitivity analysis ba sed on current utilization of the facility for a four month period as of January 20, 2016, which show s the budgeted revenues would increase by $61,769 resulting in a net profit in year one of $334,183 (bas ed on the adjusted first year budgeted net profit). The budget appears reasonable. A transition of nursing home (NH) residents to M edicaid managed care is currently being implemented statewide. Under the managed care construct, Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) will negotiate payment rates directly with NH providers. A department policy, as described in the \"Transition of Nursing Home Benefit and Population into Managed Care Poli cy Paper,\" provided guidance requiring MCOs to pay the benchmark Medicaid FFS rate, or a negotiate d rate acceptable to both plans and NH, for three Project #152227-E Exhibit Page 13 years after a county has been deemed mandatory fo r NH population enrollment. As a result, the benchmark FFS rate remains a viable basis for assessing NH revenues through the transition period.

The submitted budget indicates a net income of $3,7 31,299 during the first year after the change in stock ownership. The submitted budget is reasonable. A transition of nursing home (NH) residents to M edicaid managed care is currently being implemented statewide. Under the managed care construct, Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) will negotiate payment rates directly with NH providers. A department policy, as described in the \"Transition of Nursing Home Benefit and Population into Managed Care Poli cy Paper,\" provided guidance requiring MCOs to pay the benchmark Medicaid FFS rate, or a negotiate d rate acceptable to both plans and NH, for three years after a county has been deemed mandatory fo r NH population enrollment. As a result, the benchmark FFS rate remains a viable basis for assessing NH revenues through the transition period. BFA Attachment B is the financial summary of Higl and Care Center from 2013 through September 30, 2015. As shown, the facility had an average negativ e working capital position and an average negative net asset position for the period. The reason for the average negative working capital position is due to an increase in accounts payable associated with ne cessary renovations to the facility to improve the overall operations. Also, the facility achieved an average net income of $1,719,225 from 2013 through September 30, 2015. Project #152265-E Exhibit Page 7 BFA Attachment D is the 2013-2015 financial summar ies of Matthew Ostreicher's affiliated nursing homes, which indicates the following: Meadow Park had an average positive working c apital position and an average negative net asset position for the period shown. The facility also achieved an average net loss of $125,349 for the period shown. The 2013 loss is due to issues with the processing of the CMI rate for the facility. The loss was a one-time event that has been rectified. Brookhaven Rehab had an average negative workin g capital position and a positive net asset position for the period shown. The facility also achieved an average net income of $1,347,210 for the period. The negative working capital position is due to a current liability of $14,491,252 listed as Due to Realty. This liability should be classified as a long term liability, as this is the remaining debt left on their related company's purchase of the nursing ho me property bought in January 2015. The loan for the purchase was $15,000,000 with a 9% interest rate. If this liability were classified correctly, the facility would have had a positive working capital position for the period shown. The applicant has demonstrated the capability to proceed in a financially feasible manner. Recommendation From a financial perspective, approval is recommended.

[RNR] Council Action Date April 14, 2016 Project #152380-E Exhibit Page 5 Need Analysis Analysis The need methodology indicates a need for 57 additional beds in Genesee County. RHCF Need - Genesee County 2016 Projected Need 545 Current Beds 488 Beds Under Construction 0 Total Resources 488 Unmet Need 57 The overall occupancy for Genesee County is 92.9% for 2013 as indicated in the following chart: *unaudited, facility reported data Current occupancy as of February 3, 2016 is 97.5% . The proposed operators in tend to use their past experience to increase and maintain occupancy by: Meeting with local community leaders, hospitals and physicians to identify and develop short and long term nursing facility prog rams to address the nee ds of the community; and Utilize an internal team of Medicare, HMO and Me dicaid reimbursement experts to set up systems and procedures to ensure maximization and appropriate coding. Access Regulations indicate that the Medicaid patient admissions standard shall be 75% of the annual percentage of all Medicaid admission s for the long term care planning ar ea in which the applicant facility is located. Such planning area percentage shall not include residential health ca re facilities that have an average length of stay 30 days or fewer. If there are four or fewer resident ial health care facilities in the planning area, the applicable standard for a planning area shall be 75% of the planning area percentage of Medicaid admissions, or of the Health Sy stems Agency area Medicaid admissions percentage, whichever is less. In calculati ng such percentages, the Department will use the most current data which has been received and analyzed by the Department. 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 vs. Genesee County Project #152380-E Exhibit Page 6 An applicant will be required to make appropriate adjustments in its adm ission policies and practices so that the proportion of its own annual Medicaid patient 's admissions is at least 75% of the planning area percentage or the Health Systems Agenc y percentage, whichever is applicable. Genesee County Nursing Home's Medicaid admissions of 15.5% and 14.5% in 2012 and 2013, respectively, exceeded Genesee County's 75% rates of 9.9% and 8.1% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Conclusion Approval of this application will maintain a reso urce for the Medicaid population in the community. Recommendation From a need perspective, contingent approval is recommended.

(The lease terms are structured in this manner as the Lessor intends to pursue a HUD mortgage, which may take several years to finalize.)

Operating Budget The applicant has provided an operating budget, in 2016 dollars, for current year (2014) and year one subsequent to change of ownership, summarized as follows: Current Year Year One RHCF Revenues Per Diem Total $114,567 $90.35 $249,500 Total Expenses $15,556,648 $14,365,763 Net RHCF Occupancy % 96.58% 97.36% The following is noted with respect to the submitted budget: The first year Medicare rates are based on feder al Medicare PPS in effect for 2015 plus Medicare Part B revenues and increased by 1% per annum for inflation. Medicaid revenues include the facility's current operating and capital components based on the 2015 Medicaid rate plus assessments. Commercial and Private Pay/Other rates are incr eased by 1.0% per annum for inflation. Expenses are based on the 2014 experience of the current operator for the RHCF and AHDCP. The net loss does not include the Adult Home, which is the difference between the audited 2014 total net loss and the current year. The difference between the 2014 net loss and first year budgeted net income is due to revenue enhancements through in crease PPS rates by CMS as of 10/1/2015, an increase in CMI as shown in the 2016 Medicaid measurement, a reduction in unio n salaries and benefits, a reduction in expenses due to better negotiated contracts for purchased services and a change in vendors for better contract pricing. The first year budget takes into consideration the increased capital expenses due to the rental expense on the new mortgage through the lease payments. RHCF Utilization by payer source for current year and year one, based on historical experience, is expected as follows: Current Year Year One Medicare for the RHCF subsequent to the change of ownership is projected at 97.36% for year one. Capability and Feasibility There are no project costs associated with this application. The real property will be purchased for $15,200,0 00 with proposed members' equity of $2,280,000 and a loan for $12,920,000 financed at 8% interest with a 20 -year term. A letter of interest has been submitted from Meridian Capital Group, LLC for the loan. Be rnard Fuchs, proposed Genesee Center Operating, LLC and Batavian Realty, LLC mem ber, has submitted an affidavit st ating he is willing to contribute resources disproportionate to his ownership interest toward the real property purchase. BFA Attachment A is a summary of the net worth of the proposed members of Genesee Center Operating, LLC, which indicates the availability of sufficient funds. Working capital requirements are estimated at $2, 394,294 based on two months of the first year budgeted expenses. Working capital will be met wi th a loan of $1,170,000 and members' equity of $1,224,294. A letter of interest has been submitted fr om Capital Finance, LLC for the working capital loan at 6% over 3 years. Bernard Fuchs, proposed operating and realty entity member, has submitted an affidavit stating he is willing to contribute resources disproportionate to his owne rship interest toward the working capital requirements. Review of BFA Attachm ent A indicates the availability of sufficient funds for working capital. BFA Attachment B is the pro- forma balance sheet of Genesee Center Operating , LLC as of the first day of operations, which indica tes positive members' equity of $1,595,000. Project #152380-E Exhibit Page 13 The submitted budget indicates a net profit of $95, 837 for Year One after the change in ownership. BFA Attachment E shows the variance between the curr ent year net operating loss of $2,846,705 from 2014 audited financial statements and the first year budget net operating profit of $95,837 is explained as follows: Revenue enhancements due to an increase in the current CMI, Medicare and Commercial Insurance rates and Medicare and Commercial days - $1,154,421. Expense reductions due to no employee union contra ct, group purchasing, group therapy contracts, new vendors and group insurance policies - $2,173,738. The remaining $756,142 is based on an increase in additional capital expenses and is offset against the increases above. Loss allocated to Genesee County Adult Home - $370,525. BFA Attachment F is a budget sensitivity analysis bas ed on the current utilization of the facility for a four month period as of October 31,2015, which show s the budgeted revenues w ould decrease by $88,649 resulting in a net profit in year one of $7,188 (bas ed on the adjusted first year budgeted net profit). The budget appears reasonable. A transition of nursing home (NH) residents to M edicaid managed care is currently being implemented statewide. Under the managed care construct, Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) will negotiate payment rates directly with NH providers. A department policy, as described in the \"Transition of Nursing Home Benefit and Population into Managed Care Poli cy Paper,\" provided guidance requiring MCOs to pay the benchmark Medicaid FFS rate, or a negotiate d rate acceptable to both plans and NH, for three years after a county has been deemed mandatory fo r NH population enrollment. As a result, the benchmark FFS rate remains a viable basis for assessing NH revenues through the transition period. BFA Attachment C is the financial summary of G enesee County Nursing Facility for audited years 2013 and 2014 and the internal statements as of Octobe r 31, 2015, which indicates that the facility has experienced negative working capital, negative equity position and generated average annual net losses of $3,575,653 from 2013-2014 and $1,739,057 as of Octobe r 31, 2015. The negative working capital, net equity and net losses are due to county employee frin ge benefit costs and additional long-term liabilities owed to Genesee County. BFA Attachment D, proposed member s' affiliated RHCFs, shows positi ve operating income for the years shown. Based on the preceding, and subject to the noted contingencies, the applicant has demonstrated the capability to proceed in a financially feasible manner.

The facility has no outstanding Medicaid liabilities.

[RNR] Council Action Date April 14, 2016 Project #151260-E Exhibit Page 5 Need Analysis Analysis As calculated by the need need methodology, there is currently a surplus of one bed in Rockland County. RHCF Need - Rockland County 2016 Projected Need 1,635 Current Beds 1,676 Beds Under Construction -40 Total Resources 1,636 Unmet Need -1 The overall occupancy for Rockland County was 87.1% for 2013, as indicated in the following chart: *unaudited; based off weekly census Current occupancy, as of June 10, 2015 is 96.1%, with 8 vacant beds.

Project #151260-E Exhibit Page 12 Indian River Rehabilitation and Nursing Center was declared a CMS Special Focus facility prior to Kenneth Rozenberg obtaining a 9% interest in the current operating LLC. Mr . Rozenberg was brought into the operating structure to hel p stabilize the facility as he oper ates another RHCF in the County, Washington Center for Rehab ilitation and Healthcare. Mr. Rozen berg has committed resources to help stabilize Indian River and the fa cility appears nearing grad uation from its Specia l Focus designation. Project Review This application proposes to establish North Manor Operations Associates, LLC as the new operator of Northern Manor Geriatric Center. The facility will be operated as Nanuet Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing. The facility currently operates 231 RHCF be ds, 28 of which are certified for ventilator dependent resident care. While located in Rockland County, t he facility operates a 100 slot ADHCP program located in Brooklyn. It is the intent of the proposed opera tor to continue operation of the 100 slot ADHCP. No changes in the program or physical environment are proposed in this application. The member LLC, KR Northern Holding Company, was formed for the purpose of representing Kenneth and Beth Rozenberg's ownership interest in Nanuet Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing (Northern Manor Geriatric Center), M onsey Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing (Northern Metropolitan Residential Health Care Facility), and Haverstraw Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing. Kenneth Rozeberg is CEO and 50% owner of Centers Health Care (C enters), formerly Centers for Specialty Care Group, which provides administrative services (payroll, billing, accounts payable) as well as clinical and administrative consulting services to heal th care facilities. It is the intent of the proposed operator to contract with Centers fo r general administrative services (p ayroll, billing, accounts payable) as well as clinical and administrative consulting services . It should be noted that Centers does not have any direct ownership interest in the operations of residentia l health care facilities in New York State, nor is it proposed through this application that it will have a direct ownership interest in this facility. Despite the common ownership of one of its members, the fac ility will be a wholly independent and distinct legal entity, in no way controlled by Centers. It is common for Kenneth Rozenberg to contract with Centers for the facilities in which he has ownership interest. He uses Centers as a resource to prov ide administrative and clinical support to his skilled nursing interests across the State. To accomplish this task Centers employs a regional office type approach with central corporate resources as well as lo cal resources that can provide timely services and regionally knowledgeable clinical staff to facilities with which they contract. Kenneth Rozenburg and Jeffrey Sicklick were approved by the Public Health and Health Planning Council on December 4, 2014 to be established as operators of Triboro Center for Rehabilitation and Specialty Healthcare as members of DOJ Operations Associat es, LLC (CON# 132128). These ownership interests were not included in the Character and Competence - Background because the tr ansaction is currently being processed to effectuate the establishment of ownership. Conclusion No negative information has been received concerni ng the character and competence of the proposed applicants. All health care facilities are in substantial compliance with all rules and regulations. The individual background review indicates the applicants have met the standard for approval as set forth in Public Health Law \u00a72801-a(3). Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, c ontingent approval is recommended.

The projected Private (Geriatric) and Private (Vent) ra tes reflect increases that will be negotiated and implemented by the proposed operator. The Medicaid (Geriatric) rate is decreasing in the first year as it is based on the 1/1/15 Statewide Pricing Rate issued by t he New York State Department of Health. The applicant projected an increase in patient days as a result of referrals from hospital discharge planners as well as marketing initiatives and communit y outreach efforts. The applicant indicated that the members are experienced, seasoned operator s of a number of RHCFs in New York State and that this experience w ill facilitate the development of new rela tionships with hospital discharge planners, as well as strengthen existing relationships. Expense assumptions are based on historical ex perience except for the following expense reductions: o Salaries and wages are projected to decrease by $275,188 due to a reduction of management and administrative staff (a reduction of 4.8 FTEs) a nd select direct care staff (RNs will be reduced by 3.1 FTE and Aides/Orderlies by 10.6). The sta ffing reductions will be mitigated by increases in other direct care staff, including 7.1 FTEs for Ac tivities Program staff and an additional 1.6 FTEs for Social Workers and Psychologists. o Professional fees are projected to decrease by $191,335. o Non-medical and non-surgical supplies are projected to decrease by $130,961. The increase in capital expenses is due to rent expenses that the proposed operator will be obligated to pay for the facility pursuant to the submitted lease agreement. The applicant has indicated that patient care will not suffer as a result of the cost reductions. ADHCP: Current Year (2014) Year One Revenues $4,431,571 Net ADHCP revenues are based on cu rrent Medicaid and Private Pay reimbursement rates. The projected increase in visits is based upon the applicant's expectation that, following the change in ownership, the ADHCPs utilization will resume to its 2013 level. The applicant indicated that the decrease in utilization that occurred in 2014 was attr ibuted to an investigation by the NYS Office of the Attorney General. Corrective action was undertaken by the facility and the ADHCP has continued to operate at the modest utilization levels. ADHCP utilization broken down by payor source for the current year (2014 ) and first year is as follows: Current Year Total Medicaid 32.98% 39.89% Private 67.02% 60.11% The combined revenues a nd expenses for the entire fa cility during the first y ear after the change in operator is as follows: Current Year (2014) Year One Revenues $32,173,116 $35,133,252 Expenses 30,617,620 31,781,418 Net Income $1,555,496 $3,351,834 Project #151260-E Exhibit Page 17 Capability and Feasibility The purchase price for the acquisition of the oper ating interests is $18,116,692 and will be met with $4,539,173 of equity from the proposed members and a l oan for $13,587,519 at 5% interest for a ten-year term and 25-year amortization period. The purchase pr ice for the real estate interests is $10,000,000 and will be met via a down payment of $100,000 (paid) and a l oan for $9,900,000 at 5% interest for a ten-year term and 25-year amortization period. Letters of intere st for the respective operating and realty interest financings have been submitted. The applicant and landl ord have each submitted a ffidavits attesting that they will fund their respective balloon payments from their personal resources if acceptable financing is not available at the time of refinancing. Working capital requirements are estimated at $5,296,903, which is equivalent to two months of first year expenses. The applicant will finance $2,648,451 at an interest rate of 5% for a five-year term. The applicant submitted a letter of interest regarding t he financing. The remaining $2,648,452 will be met via equity from the proposed members' personal resource s. BFA Attachment A is the personal net worth statements of the proposed members of Northern Mano r Operations Associates, LLC, which indicates the availability of sufficient funds for the equity contribution. BFA Attachment C is a pro forma balance sheet as of the first day of operation, which indicates a positive net asset position of $7,187,595. The submitted budget indicates a net income of $3, 351,834 during the first year subsequent to the change in operator. The budget appears reasonable. A transition of nursing home (NH) residents to M edicaid managed care is currently being implemented statewide. Under the managed care construct, Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) will negotiate payment rates directly with NH providers. A department policy, as described in the \"Transition of Nursing Home Benefit and Population into Managed Care Poli cy Paper\", provided guidan ce requiring MCOs to pay the benchmark Medicaid FFS rate, or a negotiate d rate acceptable to both plans and NH, for three years after a county has been deemed mandatory fo r NH population enrollment. As a result, the benchmark FFS rate remains a viable basis for assessing NH revenues through the transition period. BFA Attachment B is a financial summary of Norther n Manor Multicare Center for the period 2012 through 2014. As shown, the facility had an average negativ e working capital position and an average negative net asset position. The applicant as indicated that the reason for the average negative working capital position and the average negative net asset position was the result of a Medicaid audit liability of over $6,000,000 that was paid in 2013. Also, the entity achieved average net income of $1,000,042 from 2012 through 2014. The applicant has indicated that the re ason for the loss in 2013 was the result of the Medicaid audit liability of over $6,000,000 that was paid in 2013. BFA Attachment D is the 2012-2014 financial summar ies of the RHCFs in which the proposed members have ownership interests. The facilities have main tained an average positive net asset position and had positive income from operations for the period show n. Some of the facilities had a negative working capital position in 2014 due to CMI and capital reimbursement changes, and vacation and sick time accruals. The applicant has indicated that the reas on for the losses for Bushwick (2013) and Chittenango Center (2012) was the result of a capital audit take-b ack. Financial statements for Washington Center for Rehabilitation and Indian River Rehabilitation and Health Care are not available as the facilities were newly acquired in 2014. Subject to the noted contingencies, the applicant ha s demonstrated the capability to proceed in a financially feasible manner. Recommendation From a financial perspective, contingent approval is recommended.

[RNR] Council Action Date April 14, 2016 Project #152295-E Exhibit Page 5 Need Analysis Analysis The current need methodology indicates a need for 320 additional beds in Rockland County. RHCF Need - Rockland County 2016 Projected Need 1,635 Current Beds 1,355 Beds Under Construction -40 Total Resources 1,315 Unmet Need 320 The overall occupancy for Rockland County is 87.2% in 2014, as indicated in the following chart: *unaudited/facilit y reported data Subsequent to the submission of this application, Summit Park Nursing Care C enter, located in Rockland County, closed. As a result, Rockland County's oc cupancy is currently 95.3%. Northern occupancy was 95.5% in 2011, 92.0% in 2012, 95.0% in 2013, and 97.5% in 2014. Occupancy for 2015 is approximately 96.6%. Current oc cupancy as of March 9, 2015 is 98.9%. Current CMI for the facility is 1.31 and, for the Medicaid -only population, 1.25. The proposed operator will implement new programs to serve a more diverse, higher acuity resident pop ulation and will include the following services: tracheo stomy care, cardiac rehab ilitation, enhanced wound care , complex clinical care and IV therapy. Access Regulations indicate that the Medicaid patient admissions standard shall be 75% of the annual percentage of all Medicaid admission s for the long term care planning ar ea in which the applicant facility is located. Such planning area perc entage shall not include residential health care facilities that have an average length of stay 30 day s or fewer. If there are four or fewer residential health care facilities in the planning area, the applicable standard for a planning area shall be 75% of the planning area percentage of Medicaid admissions, or of the Health Sy stems Agency area Medicaid admissions percentage, 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 vs. Rockland County Project #152295-E Exhibit Page 6 whichever is less. In calculating such percentages, the De partment will use the most current data which have been received and analyzed by the Department. An applicant will be required to make appropriate adjustments in its adm ission policies and practices so that the proportion of its own annual Medicaid patient 's admissions is at least 75% of the planning area percentage or the Health Systems Agenc y percentage, whichever is applicable. Northern Riverview Health Care Center's Medicaid admissions of 78.4% and 71.1% in 2012 and 2013, respectively, exceeded Rockland County's 75% rates of 24.4% and 26.5% in 2012 and 2013, respectively.

Indian River Rehabilitation and Nursing Center was declared a CMS Special Focus facility prior to Kenneth Rozenberg obtaining a 9% interest in the current operating LLC. Mr . Rozenberg was brought into the operating structure to hel p stabilize the facility as he oper ates another RHCF in the County, Washington Center for Rehab ilitation and Healthcare. Mr. Rozen berg has committed resources to help stabilize Indian River and the fac ility appears nearing graduat ion from its Special Fo cus designation. Project Review This application proposes to establish North River Operations Associate, LLC as the new operator of Northern Riverview Health Care Center. The fa cility will be operated as Haverstraw Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing. No changes in the prog ram or physical environment are proposed in this application. The member LLC, KR Northern Holding Company, was formed for the purpose of representing Kenneth and Beth Rozenberg's ownership interest in Nanuet Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing (Northern Manor Geriatric Center), M onsey Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing (Northern Metropolitan Residential Health Care Facility), and Haverstraw Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing. Kenneth Rozeberg is CEO and 50% owner of Centers Health Care (C enters), formerly Centers for Specialty Care Group, which provides administrative services (payroll, billing, accounts payable) as well as clinical and administrative consulting services to heal th care facilities. It is the intent of the proposed operators to contract with Centers for general administrative servic es (payroll, billing, accounts payable) as well as clinical and administrative consulting services. It should be noted that Centers does not have any direct ownership interest in the operations of residential health care fa cilities in New York State, nor is it proposed through this application that it will have a direct ownership interest in this facility. Despite the common ownership of one of its members, the fac ility will be a wholly independent and distinct legal entity, in no way controlled by Centers. It is common for the facilities in which Kenneth Rozenber g has an ownership interest in to contract with Centers. Centers is used as a resource to prov ide administrative and clinical support to his skilled nursing interests across the State. To accomplish this task Centers employs a regional office type approach with central corporate resources as well as lo cal resources that can provide timely services and regionally knowledgeable clinical staff to facilities they contract with. Kenneth Rozenburg and Jeffrey Sicklick were approved by the Public Health and Health Planning Council on December 4, 2014 to be established as operators of Triboro Center for Rehabilitation and Specialty Healthcare as members of DOJ Operations Associat es, LLC (CON# 132128). These ownership interests were not included in the Character and Competence - Background because the tr ansaction is currently being processed to effectuate the establishment of ownership. Conclusion No negative information has been received concerni ng the character and competence of the proposed applicants. All health care facilities are in substantial compliance with all rules and regulations. The individual background review indicates the applicants have met the standard for approval as set forth in Public Health Law \u00a72801-a(3). Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, c ontingent approval is recommended.

Historical utilization for ba se year 2014 was 97.5%. For budget Year One, Medicaid revenues are projected based on the current operating and capital components of the facility's 2015 Medicaid FFS ra te. All other revenues assume current payment rates for the respective payors. Commercial and Private Pay rates are anticipated to remain the same in Year One. Expenses are increasing in year one due to added staf f including 6.9 FTE RNs, 21.0 FTE Technician & Specialists, 2.6 FTE Aides/Orderlies, and 5. 0 FTE Environment and Food Service staff. The increase will be offset by savings in other area s related to staff reductions in Management and Project #152295-E Exhibit Page 15 Supervision (2.3 FTEs), Clerical (5.3 FTEs), LPNs (2.7 FTEs) and Social Workers (2.7 FTEs).

Capability and Feasibility There are no project costs associated with this applic ation. The purchase price for the acquisition of the operating interests is $18,909,208 and will be met wi th $4,734,802 equity from proposed members and a bank loan for $14,174,406 at 5% for a ten-year term and 25-year amortization. Greystone has provided a letter of interest for the financing at the stated term s. Proposed North River Operations Associates, LLC member Kenneth Rozenberg has submitted an affidav it stating that he will fund the balloon payment should acceptable financing not be available at the ti me the loan comes due. BFA Attachment F is the interest and amortization schedule for the ten-year term. The working capital requirement is $2,970,268 based on two months of the first year's expenses. Working capital will be satisfied with $1,485,13 4 equity from proposed members and the remaining $1,485,134 will be financed through a bank loan for five years at 5% interest. Greystone has provided a letter of interest for the working capital financing. Kenneth Rozenberg has provided an affidavit attesting that he will provide additional equity disproportionate to his membership interest for working capital. BFA Attachment A, net worth of the proposed members of North River Operations Associates, LLC, reveals sufficient resources for stated levels of equity. BFA Attachment F is the pro-forma balance sheet as of the first day of operation, which indicates a positiv e members' equity of $6,219,936. It is noted that assets include $18,909,208 in goodwill, which is not an available liquid resource, nor is it recognized for Medicaid reimbursement purposes. Excluding goodwill, members' equity would be a negative $12,689,272. The submitted budget indicates that net income of $845,548 will be generated for the first year. The budget appears reasonable. A transition of nursing home (NH) residents to M edicaid managed care is currently being implemented statewide. Under the managed care construct, Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) will negotiate payment rates directly with NH providers. A department policy, as described in the \"Transition of Nursing Home Benefit and Population into Managed Care Poli cy Paper,\" provided guidance requiring MCOs to pay the benchmark Medicaid FFS rate, or a negotiate d rate acceptable to both plans and NH, for three years after a county has been deemed mandatory fo r NH population enrollment. As a result, the benchmark FFS rate remains a viable basis for assessing NH revenues through the transition period. BFA Attachment C, financial summary of Northern Ri verview Health Care Center, indicates that the facility has maintained positive working capital, positive equity position and generated an average annual net operating profit of $4,008,175 for the 2013-2014 period shown, and a net operating profit of $2,406,149 as of June 30, 2015. BFA Attachments D, financial summary of the propos ed members' affiliated RHCF s, shows the facilities have maintained positive net income from operations for the periods shown.

[RNR] Council Action Date April 14, 2016 Project #152296-E Exhibit Page 5 Need Analysis Background and Analysis North Met Operations Associates LLC d/b/a Monsey Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing, seeks approval to become the established o perator of Northern Metropolitan Residential Health Care Facility, an existing 120-bed Article 28 residential health care fa cility (RHCF), located at 225 Maple Avenue, Monsey, 10952, in Rockland County. In addition, the applicant seeks approval to become the operator of the 46- slot adult day health care program currently operated at the facility. The need methodology indicates a need for 320 additional beds in Rockland County. RHCF Need - Rockland County 2016 Projected Need 1,635 Current Beds 1,355 Beds Under Construction -40 Total Resources 1,315 Unmet Need 320 The overall occupancy for Rockland County is 87.2% for 2014 as indicated in the following chart: *unaudited, facility reported data With the recent closing of Summit Park Nursing Care Center, Northern Metropolitan Residential Health Care Facility has received new admi ssions and is currently at 97% occupancy. Rockland County is at 95.3%. In addition to the recent influx of admissions, the applicant noted additional plans to increase and sustain occupancy at the Department's planning optimum. New programs to serve a more diverse resident population, higher acuity residents, and prevent unnecessary hospitalizations include the following services: tracheostomy care, cardiac rehab ilitation, enhanced wound care, complex clinical care and IV therapy. The applicant also plans to make cosmetic improvem ents throughout the facility as well as perform the following renovations: New lobby including hospitality and lounge areas; New multi-purpose room which will include: o A new therapy suite and solarium, with indoor/outdoor space; o A new synagogue; and 2009 2010 2011 Care Facility Facility vs. County Project #152296-E Exhibit Page 6 Additional guest suites on the ground floor, whic h will be available for over night stays for family members. The guest suites will have a significant impact on Orthodox Jewish residents, which make up approximately 60% of the residents in the facility, and whose family members are unable to travel during weekly religious observances. Access Regulations indicate that the Medicaid patient admissions standard shall be 75% of the annual percentage of all Medicaid admissions for the long term care planning area in which the applicant facility is located. Such planning area percentage shall not in clude residential health care facilities that have an average length of stay 30 days or fewer. If there are fo ur or fewer residential health care facilities in the planning area, the applicable standard for a planning area shall be 75% of the planning area percentage of Medicaid admissions, or of the Health Sy stems Agency area Medicaid admissions percentage, whichever is less. In calculating such percentages, the De partment will use the most current data which have been received and analyzed by the Department. An applicant will be required to make appropriate adjustments in its adm ission policies and practices so that the proportion of its own annual Medicaid patient 's admissions is at least 75% of the planning area percentage or the Health Systems Agenc y percentage, whichever is applicable. Northern Metropolitan Residential Health Care Fac ility's Medicaid admissions of 67.7% in 2012 and 71.1% in 2013 exceeded Rockland County 75% rate s of 24.4% and 26.5% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Conclusion With the recent closure of a nursing home in the planning area, approval of this application will result in maintaining a necessary community and Medicaid resource in Rockland County. Recommendation From a need perspective, contingent approval is recommended.

Indian River Rehabilitation and Nursing Center was declared a CMS Special Focus facility prior to Kenneth Rozenberg obtaining a 9% interest in the current operating LLC. Mr . Rozenberg was brought into the operating structure to hel p stabilize the facility as he oper ates another RHCF in the County, Washington Center for Rehab ilitation and Healthcare. Mr. Rozen berg has committed resources to help stabilize Indian River and the fac ility appears nearing graduat ion from its Special Fo cus designation. Project Review This application proposes to establish North Met Op erations Associates, LLC as the new operator of Northern Metropolitan Residential Health Care Facility. The facility will be operated as Monsey Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing. No changes in the prog ram or physical environment are proposed in this application. The member KR Northern Holding Company, LLC was formed for the purpose of representing Kenneth and Beth Rozenberg's ownership interest in Nanuet Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing (Northern Manor Geriatric Center), M onsey Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing (Northern Metropolitan Residential Health Care Facility), and Haverstraw Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing. Kenneth Rozeberg is CEO and 50% owner of Centers Health Care (C enters), formerly Centers for Specialty Care Group, which provides administrative services (payroll, billing, accounts payable) as well as clinical and administrative consulting services to heal th care facilities. It is the intent of the proposed operators to contract with Centers for general administrative servic es (payroll, billing, accounts payable) as well as clinical and administrative consulting services. It should be noted that Centers does not have any direct ownership interest in the operations of residential health care fa cilities in New York State, nor is it proposed through this application that it will have a direct ownership interest in this facility. Despite the common ownership of one of its members, the fac ility will be a wholly independent and distinct legal entity, in no way controlled by Centers. It is common for the facilities in which Kenneth Roze nberg has ownership interest to contract with Centers. Centers is a resource to provide administrative and clinical support to his skilled nursing interests across the State. To accomplish this task Centers employs a regional office type approach with central corporate resources as well as local resource s that can provide timely services and regionally knowledgeable clinical staff to facilities they contract with. Kenneth Rozenburg and Jeffrey Sicklick were approved by the Public Health and Health Planning Council on December 4, 2014 to be established as operators of Triboro Center for Rehabilitation and Specialty Healthcare as members of DOJ Operations Associat es, LLC (CON# 132128). These ownership interests were not included in the Character and Competence - Background because the tr ansaction is currently being processed to effectuate the change in ownership. Conclusion No negative information has been received concerni ng the character and competence of the proposed applicants. All health care facilities are in substantial compliance with all rules and regulations. The Project #152296-E Exhibit Page 13 individual background review indicates the applicants have met the standard for approval as set forth in Public Health Law \u00a72801-a(3). Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, c ontingent approval is recommended.

Operating Budget The applicant has provided an operating budget, in 2016 dollars, for the first year subsequent to the change of ownership. The budget is summarized below: RHCF Per Diem Current Year Per Diem % 97.1% Project #152296-E Exhibit Page 15 ADHCP Current Year Year One Revenues Medicaid $2,911,961 $2,405,545 Private Pay 642,767 1,987,014 Total ADHCP) Net Income $1,408,842 $3,030,380 The following is noted with respect to the submitted budget: The current year reflects the facility's 2014 pay or and 2014 RHCF-4 cost report information. Historical utilization for ba se year 2014 was 89.4%. For budget year one, Medicaid revenues are projected based on the current operating and capital components of the facility's 2015 Medicaid FFS ra te. All other revenues assume current payment rates for the respective payors. Private Pay rate s are anticipated to increase in year one based on forecasted increases and expectations per negotiated contracts, which are more in line with Medicare rates. Expenses will be reduced by $891,014 in the first year due to a reduction in Administrative, LPNs and Aides/Orderlies staff salaries and benefits ($ 739,809) which will not interrupt patient care, a reduction in service fees and contracts throu gh better negotiations ($48,293), and a reduction in management expenses ($102,912). The increase in ADHCP utilization is anticipated due to an increase in marketing and outreach efforts and an increase in the days of operation from six to seven days per week. The additional need for ADHC services has been created by the recent closure of Summit Park Nursing Care Center, which operated an ADHCP. Overall utilization for the RHCF is 89.4% and 95.0% for current year and year one, respectively, while utilization by payor source is as follows: Current Year and Year One Medicaid 76.29% Medicare 13.31% Private/Other 10.40% Utilization by payor source for the ADCHP for current year and year one is as follows: Current Year and Year One Medicaid 55.21% Private 44.79% Breakeven utilization for the RH CF is 97.11% for the first year. Capability and Feasibility There are no project costs associated with this application. The purchase price for the acquisition of the oper ating interests is $8,709,661 and will be met with $2,184,915 equity from the proposed members and a ban k loan for $6,524,746 at 5% for a ten-year term and 25-year amortization. Greystone ha s provided a letter of interest for t he financing at the stated terms. Proposed member Kenneth Rozenberg has submitted an affidavit stating that he will fund the balloon payment should acceptable refinancing not be available at the time the loan comes due. BFA Attachment E is the interest and amortization schedule for the ten-year term. Project #152296-E Exhibit Page 16 The working capital requirement is $2,317,105 based on two months of the first year's expenses. Working capital will be satisfied with $1,158,553 equity from the proposed members and the remaining $1,158,552 to be financed through a bank loan for five years at 5% interest. Greystone has provided a letter of interest for the working capital financing. Kenneth Rozenberg has provided an affidavit attesting that he will provide additional equity disproportionate to his membership interest for working capital. BFA Attachment A, net worth of the proposed members of North Met Operations Associates, LLC, reveals sufficient resources for the stated levels of equity. BFA Attachment D is the pro-forma balance sheet as of the first day of operation, which indicates a posi tive members' equity of $3,343,468. It is noted that assets include $8,709,661 in goodwill, which is not an available liquid resource, nor is it recognized for Medicaid reimbursement purposes. Excluding go odwill, members' equity would be negative $5,366,193. The submitted budget indicates that net income of $3,030,380 will be generated for the first year. BFA Attachment E is the budget sensitivity analysis based on current utilization of the facility as of September 30, 2015, which shows the budgeted RHCF revenues w ould decrease by $1,145,257 resulting in a net profit in year one of $1,885,123. The budget appears reasonable. A transition of nursing home (NH) residents to M edicaid managed care is currently being implemented statewide. Under the managed care construct, Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) will negotiate payment rates directly with NH providers. A department policy, as described in the \"Transition of Nursing Home Benefit and Population into Managed Care Poli cy Paper,\" provided guidance requiring MCOs to pay the benchmark Medicaid FFS rate, or a negotiate d rate acceptable to both plans and NH, for three years after a county has been deemed mandatory fo r NH population enrollment. As a result, the benchmark FFS rate remains a viable basis for assessing NH revenues through the transition period. BFA Attachment B, financial summary of Northern Metr opolitan Residential Health Care Facility, indicates that the facility has maintained average positive worki ng capital, positive equity position and generated an average annual net operating income of $1,627,851 for the 2013-2014 period shown, and a net operating income of $749,335 as of September 30, 2015. BFA Attachments C, financial summary of the propo sed members affiliated RHCF s, shows the facilities have maintained positive net income from operations for the periods shown. Based on the preceding and subject to noted cont ingencies, the applicant has demonstrated the capability to proceed in a financially feasible manner Recommendation From a financial perspective, contingent approval is recommended.

[RNR] Council Action Date April 14, 2016 Project #161109-E Exhibit Page 5 Need Analysis Project Description Abraham Operations Associates, LLC , doing business as Allerton Center for Rehabilitati on and Nursing, seeks approval to become the established operator of Beth Abraham Health Services, an existing 448- bed Article 28 residential health care facility ( RHCF), located at 612 Allerton Avenue, Bronx, 10467 in Bronx County. Analysis The need methodology indicates a need for 41,589 beds in the New York City Region. RHCF Need - New York City Region 2016 Projected Need 51,071 Current Beds 41,769 Beds Under Construction -180 Total Resources 41,589 Unmet Need 9,482 The overall 2014 occupancy for Bronx County and the New York City Region is 95.5% and 93.8%, respectively, as indicated in the following chart: *unaudited, facility reported data The facility provided daily census for 2015 yieldi ng 97.7% occupancy. The facility's self-reported occupancy thus far in 2016 is 95.7%, with current o ccupancy as of March 14, 2016 at 95.8%. The facility has maintained strong occupancy with rates close to or exceeding the Department's planning optimum of 97%. The proposed operators expect that the combin ation of the facility's existing operations and the applicant's experience as a seasoned operator of num erous RHCFs in New York State will ensure that these high rates of occupancy will be su stained upon the change of ownership. 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015* Facility Health Services Facility vs. County vs. Region Project #161109-E Exhibit Page 6 Access Regulations indicate that the Medicaid patient admissions standard shall be 75% of the annual percentage of all Medicaid admissions for the long term care planning area in which the applicant facility is located. Such planning area percentage shall not include residential health care facilities that have an average length of stay 30 days or fewer. If there are four or fewer residential health care facilities in the planning area, the applicable standard for a planning area shall be 75% of the planning area percentage of Medicaid admissions, or of the Health Sy stems Agency area Medicaid admissions percentage, whichever is less. In calculati ng such percentages, the Department will use the most current data which has been received and analyzed by the Department. An applicant will be required to make appropriate adjustments in its adm ission policies and practices so that the proportion of its own annual Medicaid patient 's admissions is at least 75% of the planning area percentage or the Health Systems Agenc y percentage, whichever is applicable. Beth Abraham Health Services' Medicaid admissions of 23.3% and 17.0% in 2013 and 2014, respectively, did not exceed Bronx County's 75% ra tes of 29.8% in 2013 and 29.1% in 2014. The facility will be required to follow the contingency plan noted below. Conclusion Approval of this application will result in maintaining a needed resource in the community.

Indian River Rehabilitation and Nursing Center was declared a CMS Special Focus facility prior to Kenneth Rozenberg obtaining a 9% interest in the current operating LLC. Mr . Rozenberg was brought into the operating structure to hel p stabilize the facility as he oper ates another RHCF in the County, Washington Center for Rehab ilitation and Healthcare. Mr. Rozen berg has committed resources to help stabilize Indian River and the fac ility appears nearing graduat ion from its Special Fo cus designation. Project Review This application proposes to establish Abraham Operat ions Associates, LLC as the new operator of Beth Abraham Health Services. The facility will be operated as Allerton Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing. No changes in the program or physical envir onment are proposed in this application. The member LLC, Light Operational Holdings Associ ates, was formed for the purpose of representing Kenneth and Beth Rozenberg's ownership interest in Allerton Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing (Beth Abraham Health Services) and Tibbits Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing (Schnurmacher Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing). Kenneth Rozeberg is CEO and 50% owner of Centers Health Care (C enters), formerly Centers for Specialty Care Group, which provides administrative services (payroll, billing, accounts payable) as well as clinical and administrative consulting services to heal th care facilities. It is the intent of the proposed operators to contract with Centers for general administrative servic es (payroll, billing, accounts payable) as well as clinical and administrative consulting services. It should be noted that Centers does not have any direct ownership interest in the operations of residential health care fa cilities in New York State, nor is it proposed through this application that it will have a direct ownership interest in this facility. Despite the common ownership of one of its members, the fac ility will be a wholly independent and distinct legal entity, in no way controlled by Centers. Project #161109-E Exhibit Page 13 It is common for facilities in which Kenneth Rozenberg has an ownership interest to contract with Centers. They use Centers as a resource to provide admin istrative and clinical support to his skilled nursing interests across the State. To accomplish this task Centers employs a regional office type approach with central corporate resources as well as local resource s that can provide timely services and regionally knowledgeable clinical staff to facilities they contract with. Kenneth Rozenburg and Jeffrey Sicklick were approved by the Public Health and Health Planning Council on December 4, 2014 to be established as operators of Triboro Center for Rehabilitation and Specialty Healthcare as members of DOJ Operations Associat es, LLC (CON# 132128). These ownership interests were not included in the Character and Competence background because the tr ansaction is currently being processed to effectuate the establishment of ownership. Conclusion No negative information has been received concerni ng the character and competence of the proposed applicants. All health care facilities are in substantial compliance with all rules and regulations. The individual background review indicates the applicants have met the standard for approval as set forth in Public Health Law \u00a72801-a(3).

The budget is summarized below: Per Diem Current Year Per Diem Year Breakeven 96.8% The following is noted with respect to the submitted budget: The current year reflects the facility's 2014 pay or and 2014 RHCF-4 cost report information. Historical utilization for base y ear 2014 was 96.8% occupancy. For budget year one, Medicaid revenues are projected based on the current operating and capital components of the facility's 2016 Medicaid FFS ra te. All other revenues assume current payment rates for the respective payors. Commercial rates are conservative and Private Pay rates have been increased by 6.6% for year one. For budgeted year one, Medicare includes the Part B therapy revenues. Other* revenues represent vending machine commiss ions, rentals, rebates and discounts, medical records abstract fees and activities income. Expenses are decreasing in year one due to reduction in salaries and benefits from unnecessary management, food service and aide staff, with an offs et increase in needed ar eas such as therapists and LPNs Overall utilization is 96.8% and 98.0% for current year and year one, respectively, while utilization by payor source is as follows: Current Year Year 158,245 inpatient days for the first year. Capability and Feasibility There are no project costs associated with this application. The purchase price for the acquisition of the oper ating interests is $30,305,600 and will be met with $5,100,000 held in escrow, $6,301,400 equity fr om the proposed members and a bank loan for $18,904,200 at 5% for a ten-year term and 25-year amortization. Greystone has provided a letter of interest for the financing at the stated terms. Pr oposed Abraham Operations Associates LLC member, Kenneth Rozenberg, has submitted an affidavit stating that he will fund the balloon payment should acceptable financing not be available at the time the loan comes due. BFA Attachment F is the interest and amortization schedule for the ten-year term. Project #161109-E Exhibit Page 16 The working capital requirement is $8,927,681 based on two months of the first year's expenses. Working capital will be satisfied with $4,463,84 0 equity from proposed members and the remaining $4,463,841 will be financed through a bank loan for five years at 5% interest. Greystone has provided a letter of interest for the working capital financing. Kenneth Rozenberg has provided an affidavit attesting that he will provide additional equity disproportionate to his membership interest for working capital. BFA Attachment A, net worth of the proposed members of Abraham Operations Associates LLC, reveals sufficient resources for stated levels of equity. BFA Attachment E is the pro-forma balance sheet as of the first day of operation, which indicates a positiv e members' equity of $15,865,241. It is noted that assets include $30,305,600 in goodwill, which is not an available liquid resource, nor is it recognized for Medicaid reimbursement purposes. Excluding goodwill, members' equity would be a negative $14,440,359. The submitted budget indicates that net income of $678,131 will be generated for the first year. BFA Attachment G is the budget sensitivity analysis based on current utilization of the facility as of December 31, 2015, which shows the budgeted revenues would increa se by $5,173,392 resulting in a net income in year one of $5,851,523. The budget appears reasonable. A transition of nursing home (NH) residents to M edicaid managed care is currently being implemented statewide. Under the managed care construct, Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) will negotiate payment rates directly with NH providers. A department policy, as described in the \"Transition of Nursing Home Benefit and Population into Managed Care Poli cy Paper,\" provided guidance requiring MCOs to pay the benchmark Medicaid FFS rate, or a negotiate d rate acceptable to both plans and NH, for three years after a county has been deemed mandatory fo r NH population enrollment. As a result, the benchmark FFS rate remains a viable basis for assessing NH revenues through the transition period. BFA Attachment C, financial summary of Beth Abraha m Health Services, indicates that the facility has maintained positive working capital, positive equity position and generated an average annual net operating income of $1,833,332 for the 2013-2014 peri od shown, and net operating income of $3,730,934 as of December 31, 2015. BFA Attachments D, financial summary of the propos ed members' affiliated RHCF s, shows the facilities have maintained positive net income from operati ons for the periods shown. In 2015, Kenneth Rozenberg and Beth Rozenberg obtained final PHHPC app roval for membership interest in Hope Center for HIV & Nursing Care, a 66-bed RHCF located in the Bronx, and Kennet h Rozenberg and Jeffery Sicklick obtained final PHHPC approval for membership interest in Buffalo Center for Rehabilitation & Nursing, a 200-bed RHCF located in Buffalo. K enneth Rozenberg has a 10% membership interest in Northwoods Rehab & Nursing Center at Moravia, a 40-bed RHCF located in Moravia. In 2016, the following RHCF applications for Kenneth Rozenberg, Beth Rozenberg and Jeffery Sicklick are pending; CON 152295-Northern Riverview Health Care Center, Inc., a 180-bed RHCF located in Haverstraw; CON 152296-Northern Metropolitan Residential Health Ca re Facility, 120-bed RHCF located in Monsey; and CON 151260-Northern Manor , Inc., a 23-bed RHCF located in Nanuet.

[RNR] Council Action Date April 14, 2016 Project #161110-E Exhibit Page 5 Need Analysis Analysis The need methodology indicates a need for 498 additional beds in Westchester County. RHCF Need - Westchester County 2016 Projected Need 6,716 Current Beds 6,066 Beds Under Construction 152 Total Resources 6,218 Unmet Need 498 The overall occupancy for Westchester County is 92.4% for 2014 as indicated in the following chart: *unaudited, facility reported data The facility provided daily census for 2015 indicati ng a 96.1% occupancy. Occu pancy thus far in 2016 is 96.8%. The facility has maintained strong occupancy with rates clos e to or exceeding the Department's planning optimum of 97%. The propos ed operators expect that the combination of the facility's existing operations and the applicant's experience as a se asoned operator of numerous RHCFs in New York State will ensure that these high rates of occupa ncy will be sustained upon t he change of ownership. Access Regulations indicate that the Medicaid patient admissions standard shall be 75% of the annual percentage of all Medicaid admission s for the long term care planning ar ea in which the applicant facility is located. Such planning area percentage shall not include residential health ca re facilities that have an average length of stay 30 days or fewer. If there are four or fewer resident ial health care facilities in the planning area, the applicable standard for a planning area shall be 75% of the planning area percentage of Medicaid admissions, or of the Health Sy stems Agency area Medicaid admissions percentage, whichever is less. In calculati ng such percentages, the Department will use the most current data which has been received and analyzed by the Department. 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015* Facility and Nursing Facility vs. Westchester County Project #161110-E Exhibit Page 6 An applicant will be required to make appropriate adjustments in its adm ission policies and practices so that the proportion of its own annual Medicaid patient 's admissions is at least 75% of the planning area percentage or the Health Systems Agenc y percentage, whichever is applicable.

Indian River Rehabilitation and Nursing Center was declared a CMS Special Focus facility prior to Kenneth Rozenberg obtaining a 9% interest in the current operating LLC. Mr . Rozenberg was brought Project #161110-E Exhibit Page 12 into the operating structure to hel p stabilize the facility as he oper ates another RHCF in the County, Washington Center for Rehab ilitation and Healthcare. Mr. Rozen berg has committed resources to help stabilize Indian River and the fac ility appears nearing graduat ion from its Special Fo cus designation. Project Review This application proposes to establish Schnur Op erations Associates, LLC as the new operator of Schnurmacher Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing. The facility will be operated as Tibbits Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing. No changes in the prog ram or physical environment are proposed in this application. The member LLC, Light Operational Holdings Associ ates, was formed for the purpose of representing Kenneth and Beth Rozenberg's ownership interest in Allerton Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing (Beth Abraham Health Services) and Tibbits Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing (Schnurmacher Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing). Kenneth Rozeberg is CEO and 50% owner of Centers Health Care (C enters), formerly Centers for Specialty Care Group, which provides administrative services (payroll, billing, accounts payable) as well as clinical and administrative consulting services to heal th care facilities. It is the intent of the proposed operators to contract with Centers for general administrative servic es (payroll, billing, accounts payable) as well as clinical and administrative consulting services. It should be noted that Centers does not have any direct ownership interest in the operations of residential health care fa cilities in New York State, nor is it proposed through this application that it will have a direct ownership interest in this facility. Despite the common ownership of one of its members, the fac ility will be a wholly independent and distinct legal entity, in no way controlled by Centers. It is common for facilities in which Kenneth Rozenberg has an ownership interest to contract with Centers. They use Centers as a resource to provide admin istrative and clinical support to his skilled nursing interests across the State. To accomplish this task Centers employs a regional office type approach with central corporate resources as well as local resource s that can provide timely services and regionally knowledgeable clinical staff to facilities they contract with. Kenneth Rozenburg and Jeffrey Sicklick were approved by the Public Health and Health Planning Council on December 4, 2014 to be established as operators of Triboro Center for Rehabilitation and Specialty Healthcare as members of DOJ Operations Associat es, LLC (CON# 132128). These ownership interests were not included in the Character and Competence background because the tr ansaction is currently being processed to effectuate the establishment of ownership. Conclusion No negative information has been received concerni ng the character and competence of the proposed applicants. All health care facilities are in substantial compliance with all rules and regulations. The individual background review indicates the applicants have met the standard for approval as set forth in Public Health Law \u00a72801-a(3).

For budgeted year one, Medicare includes the Part B therapy revenues. Project #161110-E Exhibit Page 15 Other* revenues represent vending machine commiss ions, rentals, rebates and discounts, medical records abstract fees and activities income.

Greystone has provided a letter of interest for the financing at the stated terms. Proposed Schnur Operations Associates LLC member, Kenneth Rozenberg, has submitted an affi davit stating that he will fund t he balloon payment should acceptable financing not be available at the time the loan come s due. BFA Attachment F is the interest and amortization schedule for the ten-year term. The working capital requirement is $3,356,465 based on two months of the first year's expenses. Working capital will be satisfied with $1,678,23 2 equity from proposed members and the remaining $1,678,233 will be financed through a bank loan for five years at 5% interest. Greystone has provided a letter of interest for the working capital financing. Kenneth Rozenberg has provided an affidavit attesting that he will provide additional equity disproportionate to his membership interest for working capital. BFA Attachment A, net worth of the proposed members of Schnur Operations As sociates LLC, reveals sufficient resources for stated levels of equity. BF A Attachment E provides the pro-forma balance sheet as of the first day of operation, which indicates a po sitive members' equity of $6,366,733. It is noted that assets include $12,454,000 in goodwill, which is not an available liquid resource, nor is it recognized for Medicaid reimbursement purposes. Excluding goodwill, members' equity would be a negative $6,087,267. The submitted budget projects net income of $406,010 fo r the first year. BFA Attachment G is the budget sensitivity analysis based on current utilization of the facility as of December 31, 2015, which shows the budgeted revenues would increase by $837,291 resulti ng in a net income in year one of $1,243,301. The budget appears reasonable. A transition of nursing home (NH) residents to M edicaid managed care is currently being implemented statewide. Under the managed care construct, Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) will negotiate payment rates directly with NH providers. A department policy, as described in the \"Transition of Nursing Home Benefit and Population into Managed Care Poli cy Paper,\" provided guidance requiring MCOs to pay the benchmark Medicaid FFS rate, or a negotiate d rate acceptable to both plans and NH, for three years after a county has been deemed mandatory fo r NH population enrollment. As a result, the benchmark FFS rate remains a viable basis for assessing NH revenues through the transition period. BFA Attachment C, financial summary of Schnurmacher Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing, indicates that the facility has maintained positive working capi tal, positive equity position and generated an average annual net operating loss of $497,149 for the 2013-2014 period shown, and net operating income of $555,467 as of December 31, 2015. The 2013-2014 oper ating loss was due to increases in corporate overhead expenses and losses from patient accounts. Project #161110-E Exhibit Page 16 BFA Attachments D, financial summary of the propos ed members' affiliated RHCF s, shows the facilities have maintained positive net income from operati ons for the periods shown.
