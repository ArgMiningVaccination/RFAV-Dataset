Many of us have felt anxious on occasion. But for the millions of people globally living with an anxiety disorder, anxiety occurs more regularly. From therapy to [medication](https://psychcentral.com/anxiety/medication-and-anxiety) and yoga to meditation, there are many approaches to help reduce anxiety. Another popular option is dietary supplements. While there's still more to be learned about supplements and their role in mental health, [2021 research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7907178/) If you're wondering how supplements may help you curb anxiety, we've got you covered. We've rounded up 10 of our top choices, including specific products we recommend. Supplements for anxiety may work, but results can depend on various factors, including: - how much you take - other treatments you may be using - other conditions you have or medications you use Even though they're not medications, supplements can be powerful. Science still has more to learn about what dosages are effective (and what may be dangerous), so it's best to begin with the smallest dose possible. If you're already participating in [therapy](https://psychcentral.com/lib/psychotherapy), taking anti-anxiety medications, or receiving other treatment, supplements shouldn't be used as a replacement remedy. In these cases, adding supplements as part of your treatment plan may help reduce symptoms further. Supplements may also interact with certain medications, conditions, and even other supplements. People with psychiatric conditions and those who are pregnant or taking medications should talk with a doctor before adding any supplement to their diet, as there may be risks. It's important to talk with a healthcare professional for guidance if you have any questions or want to learn more.

A [2019 review](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11130-019-00771-5) of 9 studies found that taking 200 to 400 milligrams (mg) of L-theanine supplements each day reduced stress and anxiety levels in people exposed to stressful situations. A small [2019 study](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/10/2362) supports L-theanine's effectiveness in soothing stress-related symptoms and its ability to help reduce sleep disturbances. L-theanine is most commonly available in 200-mg capsules. As with any supplement, it's best to start with the lowest dose possible when trying L-theanine.

Ashwagandha Ashwagandha is an Ayurvedic herb used in India for many centuries. It's gained widespread popularity in the United States as a supplement in recent years, particularly as a remedy for stress and anxiety. While research into the benefits of ashwagandha is still fairly new, it does look promising. A small [2019 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6979308/) Because we're still learning about the benefits of ashwagandha, there's uncertainty over how much should be taken.

Magnesium Magnesium is an important and essential mineral that plays a role in almost every function of your body, including muscle function, blood pressure, and how it responds to stress. It supports your metabolism to help your body best use carbohydrates, fats, and amino acids. Magnesium is generally safe to take.

Saffron Saffron may be popular in the culinary world, but it's also known for its medicinal properties. This brightly colored spice is packed with antioxidants. Saffron supplements may help elevate mood and help you relax. In a [2018 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5938102/) [Recent clinical trials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032717315884) have also shown saffron to be as effective as antidepressant medications in treating depression \u2014 but with fewer side effects. - Price: $ - Manufacturer-recommended dosage: 1 capsule (50 mg) twice daily with food What we like - It's gluten-free, soy-free, corn-free, egg-free, vegan, and non-GMO. - The product uses whole saffron stigma powder rather than an extract.

Psych Central encourages you to make any treatment decisions with your healthcare professional. There's a lot of hype around cannabidiol (CBD), a popular natural remedy derived from the cannabis sativa plant. It has many reported uses, including soothing pain, treating acne, and easing anxiety. A [2020 research review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7092763/) [2015 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604171/) [calming relief](https://psychcentral.com/anxiety/what-to-know-about-cbd-for-anxiety) to those with: - generalized anxiety disorder - panic disorder - social anxiety disorder [obsessive-compulsive disorder](https://psychcentral.com/ocd) [post-traumatic stress disorder](https://psychcentral.com/ptsd) While CBD is generally considered safe, there's still a lot we don't know about it. More research is needed on its benefits, safety, and how it may interact with other medications. Is CBD legal? The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the legal definition of [marijuana](https://www.healthline.com/health/hemp-vs-marijuana) in the Controlled Substances Act. This made some hemp-derived CBD products with less than 0.3 percent THC federally legal. However, CBD products containing more than 0.3 percent THC still fall under the legal definition of marijuana, making them federally illegal but legal under some state laws. Be sure to check [state laws](https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx), especially when traveling. Also, keep in mind that the FDA has not approved nonprescription CBD products, and some products may be inaccurately labeled. - Price: $$$ - Manufacturer-recommended dosage: 1 capsule (25 mg) up to two times a day What we like - Charlotte's Web is a highly respected CBD brand that provides a certificate of analysis for its products. - The product only contains full-spectrum hemp extract and organic extra-virgin olive oil, with no other added ingredients. - It's gluten-free, vegan, kosher, and allergen-free.

[Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process) - While CBD products that contain 0.3% [THC](/health/cbd-vs-thc)or less are legal on a federal level, individual states may have their own [legislation](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx). It's important to be mindful of state laws when using or traveling with CBD. Vitamin D Vitamin D is an important nutrient that helps balance mood and keeps your brain healthy. The human body naturally makes vitamin D when it's exposed to sunlight. We can also get it from certain foods or through supplements. [Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032716308928) has connected low levels of vitamin D with depression, which suggests that a deficiency may also be tied to other mood disorders, including anxiety. A 2019 study suggests that vitamin D effectively lessens the severity of anxiety disorder symptoms. The dosage depends on your body's levels of vitamin D. A doctor can test your vitamin D levels to help you determine what dose is right for you. - Price: $ - Manufacturer-recommended dosage: 1 softgel (125 mcg) daily What we like - It's gluten-free, non-GMO, contains no artificial colors or flavors, and has no chemical preservatives. - The product is designed to have a smaller carbon footprint.

People with optimal vitamin D levels may not need this much on a daily basis. Omega-3s Omega-3s are fats with powerful anti-inflammatory properties. Your body can't make omega-3 fats on its own and must get them from food or supplements. A [2018 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6324500/) Omega-3 fats seem to be most effective in high doses, as the review notes that significant anti-anxiety effects were seen in studies using at least 2,000 mg of omega-3s each day. - Price: $$$ - Manufacturer-recommended dosage: 2 softgels (2,150 mg of total omega-3s) daily with food What we like - Nordic Naturals honors transparency and provides a certificate of analysis for its supplements. - All Nordic Naturals omega-3 [fish oil](/adhd/fish-oil-for-adhd)products are in the triglyceride molecular form that's naturally found in fish, which aids absorption.

Multiple studies have touted vitamin C's effectiveness in treating symptoms of anxiety in people of all ages. A [2015 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26353411/) [2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24511708/) [2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28178022/) How much vitamin C you need depends on your age. You can generally get the recommended amounts [through fruits](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-foods). - Price: $$ - Manufacturer-recommended dosage: 1 teaspoon (5 ml = 1,000 mg of vitamin C) daily, ideally on an empty stomach and at least 10 minutes before a meal What we like - This product is in liquid form, which aids in faster absorption and effectiveness \u2014 and makes it easier to swallow (especially for people who don't like tablets or capsules). - It contains liposomal vitamin C, a fast-acting form of vitamin C that suggests is more bioavailable than non-liposomal vitamin C. [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32901526/) - It's non-GMO and buffered to be easy on sensitive stomachs. What to look out for can cause nausea, diarrhea, or stomach pain. [Too much vitamin C](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/#h8) - Vitamin C with certain cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy. [may interact](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/#h9) - It may interfere with certain prescription and over-the-counter medications, including those that regulate cholesterol. It's important to talk with a doctor before taking a vitamin C supplement if you are using any medications. Chamomile Most commonly [used for tea](https://psychcentral.com/health/tea-for-stress), chamomile is best known for its soothing, calming effect. A [2014 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5650245/) Plus, a [2016 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S094471131630188X) found that chamomile may reduce symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder with regular use. Still, more research is needed on chamomile's effectiveness and dosing. Because it's available in various forms \u2014 including capsules, oils, and tea \u2014 recommended dosages can vary greatly. It's best to read the directions on any product carefully and reach out to a healthcare professional with any questions. - Price: $ - Manufacturer-recommended dosage: 2 capsules (700 mg) twice daily with water What we like - The product is approved by the Swanson Quality Code, which ensures quality, purity, and potency through company-internal experts and third-party labs. - All Swanson products come with a 100% money-back guarantee.

However, if your symptoms are becoming overwhelming or affecting your day-to-day activities or overall quality of life, it may be time to [ask for help](https://psychcentral.com/health/find-help). Seeking support from a medical or mental health professional can provide you with tailored treatment options. This can include talk therapy, medication, or other techniques or remedies. If the products on this list aren't what you're looking for, many other options are available. Here are some things to keep in mind when you're searching for a high quality supplement: - reputable brand - brand transparency - quality ingredients - certifications (by third-party organizations) - positive user reviews Because the FDA doesn't regulate dietary supplements to the same degree as medications, searching for high quality products is especially important. [You can learn more about choosing a high quality supplement here.](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-choose-high-quality-vitamins-and-supplements) How long does it take for anxiety supplements to have an effect? How long it takes can vary. No set rule tells us when to expect them to start working. Some supplements can begin working within 30 to 60 minutes of taking them. Others need to build up over time, taking multiple weeks of regular use to see results. For example, [research from 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5487054/) It may help to read the product label for dosage instructions and information on effectiveness. Consider speaking with a doctor if you have any questions. Are anxiety supplements safe? Supplements are generally considered safe, but specific factors can put you at a higher risk of unpleasant or dangerous side effects, including: - pregnancy - breast- or chestfeeding - prescription medications - chronic medical conditions It's important to talk with a healthcare professional before adding supplements to your diet, especially if any above applies to you. Supplements should also not be given to infants or small children without first consulting a doctor. Will supplements cure my anxiety? While supplements may help you manage some symptoms, they likely won't cure your anxiety. Because anxiety is often a result of an underlying cause \u2014 like past experiences or biological factors \u2014 it's best to seek the support of a medical or mental health professional. They can help you address, understand, and learn to successfully manage your anxiety long term. Can I take herbal supplements along with my prescription medication? Some supplements can interact with prescription medications and interfere with their effectiveness. If you're taking a prescription medication, it's important to talk with your doctor before starting any supplements to avoid potential risks. Supplements are just one of the many options available when looking for ways to manage anxiety. They can be a natural alternative or used as part of a broader [treatment plan](https://psychcentral.com/anxiety/generalized-anxiety-disorder-treatment). While more research is needed, current findings are promising. Studies have shown the effectiveness of supplements in easing anxiety. Popular supplements include magnesium, curcumin, CBD, and vitamin D. Even though they're generally considered safe, anxiety supplements are not for everyone. If you're pregnant, taking medication, or living with a chronic illness, it's important to consult your treatment team before adding supplements to your care routine to avoid any unwanted side effects.
