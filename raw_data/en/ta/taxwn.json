Risks and Possible Side Effects Influenza vaccine generally causes only mild side effects that occur at low frequency. Most commonly, the reactions may be a sore or tender arm at the injection site, or possible low grad e fever, chills, headaches, or muscle aches. These effects usually last 24 to 72 hours. Most people who receive the vaccine e ither have no or only mild reactions. There is a possibility as with any vaccine or drug, that an allergic or other serious reactio n, or even death could occur. Moreover, untoward medical events completely unrelated to vaccine administration may occur coincidentally during the period following vaccination. Unlik e the 1976 swine influenza vaccine, flu vaccines used subsequently have no t been clearly associated with an increased frequency of Guillain -Barre Syndrome, which is a neurological disease associated with ascending paralysis. I have read the above list of possible problems and or risks as a result of receiving the influenza vac cine. I am hereby requesting that Community Employer Health professionals administer an influenza vaccination.
