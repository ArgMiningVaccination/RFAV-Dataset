Announced on March 4, 2009, President Obama has invested $75 billion in helping homeowners avoid fo reclosure. For approximately 3 to 4 million families, he is proposing a governme nt subsidy to your lender in exchange for lowering your monthly mortgage payment to an affordable level. How does it work? The Plan works by incentivizing your lender to reduce the monthly mortgage payment ( including principal, interest, monthly property tax and homeowner's insurance escrow, and condo assessments) on 1 st mortgages to 31% of the household's gross monthly i ncome. If you are approved, you will be placed on a 3-month trial plan. If you make each payment on time, the modification will be extended for 5 years. At the end of the 5 years, your interest rate can go up 1% per year until it reaches the mar ket rate at the time you got the modification (@ 4.75% if you got the modification t oday). A few other terms apply: 1) Your taxes and insurance will be escrowed; 2) Accrued interest and lender expenses (attorney fees , etc.) will be added to your outstanding principal balance, all la te fees will be waived; 3) There is no fee for getting the modification; 4) Pending foreclosures must be postponed during the e valuation and trial period; and 5) If, after the modification, your mortgage payment a nd other credit report debt exceed 55% of your gross monthly income , you must agree to credit counseling with a HUD-Certified Hou sing Counseling Agency. How Will My Payments Get Lowered? Your lender can lower your mortgage payment to 31% of gross monthly incom e by taking 3 steps. Remember that your lender will only do what is nece ssary to make your payment equal to 31% of gross monthly income and no more. 1) lowering your interest rate to as low as 2%; 2) extending the length of the loan to 40 years; and 2 3) Reducing or deferring principal if you have substan tial negative equity. Do I qualify? To determine if you qualify under the Plan, see i f you meet all of the following criteria: 1) Owner-occupied 1-4 unit property; 2) Home 1st mortgage loan is under $729,750 (1 unit), $934,200 (2 units), $1,129,250 (3 units), $1,403,400 (4 units); 3) Loan originated before January 1, 2009; 4) Homeowner has income that will support monthly mort gage payments at 31% of gross monthly income; 5) Loan is not FHA or VA insured; 6) You have a Hardship such as a loss of income, chang e in circumstances (such as divorce), or increase in exp enses; and 7) Your current 1 st mortgage PITIA payment is over 31% of your gross monthly income Next, to determine if you have enough income to support the monthly mortgage payment at 31% of gross monthly income, do the following basic math: Step 1: Calculate 31% of GMI (Gross Monthly Income) $___________________ Step 2: Subtract monthly property tax payments $___________________ Step 3: Subtract monthly homeowner's insurance paym ent $___________________ Step 4: This equals available funds for P&I Payment $___________________ Step 5: Principal balance divided by 1,000 * 3.7 $___________________ (this equals the potential P&I payment at 2%) If Line 5 is equal to or less than Line 4, you shou ld qualify.

President Obama's Homeowner and Stability Plan, known as Making Home Affordable was announced earlier this month. Website: www.makinghomeaffordable.gov The program has two primary parts: a $75 billion Loan Modification Program that is expected to help four million homeowners currently in or at -risk of foreclosure modify their loans; and $200 billion for re -financing , allowing homeowners who were previously unable to refinance their mortgage because the value of their home has dropped to do so. This event will focus only on the part of the Obama plan that deals with modifying loan agreements. Any bank that receives federal money under the Treasury Department's $700 billion financial rescue program is required to participate. There are five more in the City's series of Borrower Outreach Days between April and December. The city has sponsored14 of these events since 2007 and provided help to more than 3,200 homeowners.
