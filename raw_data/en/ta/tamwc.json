The Middle States Commission on Higher Education is an in stitutional accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education and the C ouncil for Higher Education Accreditation. At its session on November 18, 2010, the Midd le States Commission on Higher Education granted Mount Sinai School of Medicine accredit ation. On the same day, the New York Board of Regents approved a new charter recognizing the school's independence and official name change to \"Mount Sinai School of Medicine\". Mount Sinai School of Medicine is accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education of the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Amer ican Medical Association. Its teaching hospitals are accredited by the Join t Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations. All educational programs of the School of Medicine and its aff iliated institutions have been approved by the governmental, academic, and professional bodies having responsibility in the respective areas. These include the Board of Re gents of the State of New York, the State Education Department, the Board of Higher E ducation of the City of New York, Council on Education for Public Health, American Board of Genetic Counseling, and medical specialty boards and professional societies. Diversity Statement Mount Sinai School of Medicine is committe d to promoting and supporting diversity and inclusion in the research, clinical, and educat ional realms, and to meeting the needs of our diverse students, faculty, staff, and the commun ities we serve. We are committed to increasing the representation of women, ethnic minorities, and individuals who are members of groups underrepresented in medicine and science among our trainees, rese arch and clinical faculty and our leadership. Diversity in the health professi ons and science benefits every aspect of he alth, healthcare and biomedical research by addressi ng the needs of the world's dive rse communities. In addition, a diverse professional and academic environment enhances the learning experiences of all students, trainees, and postdoctora l fellows and effectively impact s culturally dive rse populations to achieve health equity a nd improve health outcomes. Mount Sinai's commitment to diversity is reflec ted in our continued determination to increase the diversity of our faculty and trainees. Our longstanding tradition of successfully attracting, retaining, and promoting a divers e student body has made us a natio nal leader in the movement to train future physicians and sc ientists belonging to groups hi storically underrepresented in medicine and science. 9 1. Programs of Study The Graduate School of Biological Sciences is an integral part of Mount Sinai School of Medicine, an institution that ha s enjoyed a tremendous expansion of its excellent basic research faculty in addition to further bui lding its excellent clinical re search faculty. There is the concomitant enrichment and development of our educational programs and our research and educational facilities. The institution is furthe r dedicated and prepared to apply new knowledge towards the development of insights into human disease and of new therapies and preventive strategies. 1.1 PhD Program Our students are at the heart of these investigative activities as partners in the work, whereby they receive the most significant part of their doctoral training in a mentor-student relationship leading to the PhD dissertation. This research centerpiece of their training is preceded by a period of exploration of the Graduate Faculty and Multidisciplinary Training Areas (MTAs) in a year of core courses, specia l seminars/journal clubs and labor atory rotations. It is further enhanced by an individualiz ed program of advanced coursework within one of eight Multidisciplinary Training Areas, a format that is at the cutting-edge of modern science research training. Doctoral students may enter the PhD or MD/PhD Programs without a formal commitment to a particular MTA. This allows their initial explor ation of potential resear ch mentors and areas of concentration to remain fully open to changes in th eir interests as they participate in the General Program Requirements and learn about new areas of research through th eir seminars, journal clubs and laboratory rotations. Stud ents with well-defined interests are encouraged to focus their rotations within the realm of that interest even before any written commitment to a particular dissertation advisor or MTA. Th e rotation duration is a thirteen -week half time training in the laboratory of a graduate faculty member. At th e end of each rotation stud ents are expected to present their rotation experience to their peers at least twice within the year. After the rotation period at the end of year 1, st udents are expected to formally choose a research mentor, and decide on the Multidisciplinar y Training Area if they have not already done so planning matriculation, in which they will focus their advanced coursework, journal clubs and seminars and choose three members in their Advisory Committee with whom they will be meeting at least once a year to assess their progress. All students must be full-time. All students are require d to develop a resear ch project, under the supervision of one or more facu lty members, which results in a thesis that reports the new findings, and is presented, defended and deposite d. The choice of the research laboratory, through a series of laboratory rotations (BSR 1006 and BSR 1007) and academic credit for the thesis project (BSR 8000 and BSR 9000) are part of each student's academic program. The maximum time limit for the completion of all requ irements for the PhD degree is seven years. PhD students must defend and deposit the dissert ation by June 30 of the seventh year in the Program. Students who do not deposit by April 15 w ill not be eligible to receive their degree in the graduation ceremony of the same year. In orde r to be able to partic ipate in the graduation 10 ceremony of the same year, students will be expect ed to have successfully defended before the graduation ceremony. The PhD degree is granted either in Neurosciences or in Biomedi cal Sciences by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. 1.2 MD/PhD Program The MD/PhD Program is designed for students inte rested in careers in medical research and academic medicine. Students entering into the dual program take advantage of the flexibility in the School's curricular structure to complete the graduate school 's Core courses during th eir first year of their MD/PhD phase. They partially substitute this work for a block of the Medical School curriculum. First year MD/PhD students also be gin other portions of their Graduate Program -- Laboratory Rotations during the summers and Introduction to Journal Club. Students are required to participate in the Medical Scientist Research Seminars (MSRS), which is a special seminar series that gives MD/PhD students th e opportunity to hear presentations by other MD/PhD students as well as new faculty. MD/PhD students take the other elements of the initial Medical School curriculum and thus forge bonds with both the entering PhD and MD classes. The Laboratory Rotation helps guide MD/PhD stude nts towards an optimal choice of dissertation advisor and MTA. The minimum rotation period is six weeks of full-time work and students are expected to formulate a decision on their choi ce of a dissertation advi sor by the end of the summer between the first and second year in th e program. The rotation work is graded as a 4- credit component of the Graduate School course. Students are exp ected to present each of their rotation experience to their MD/PhD peers at th e end of summer. For t hose rotations, MD/PhD students should uti lize the standard Rotation Agreement and Evaluation forms. The PhD work is usually completed during the three to four years after the initial two years of the Medical School and Graduate Sc hool coursework. The student will complete the final clinical training component of the Medical School curric ulum after the doctoral dissertation has been successfully completed. During the PhD phase , students will build upon the pathophysiologic and clinical diagnosis ma terial already mastered. During the final year of PhD phase, students will pa rticipate in an intensive clinical refresher. This will involve spending one afternoon each we ek with specially chosen clinical mentors Students can take maximal advantage of the flex ibility of timing for entry into the clinical clerkships to complete the total Program w ithout \"down time\", and also position the major clinical work in closest juxtaposition to the postgraduate residency trai ning that most MD/PhD students elect after graduation. MD/PhD students will not be permitted to begin the third year of the Medical School curriculum after the PhD period of work unless the diss ertation is both defended and deposited. The responsibility for open, realistic and careful planning is shared by the student and dissertation 11 advisor. This provides the maxi mum opportunity for the student to do the best possible job in both arenas. MD/PhD students who return to th e third year of medical school mu st complete the same clinical requirements as other medical st udents during a period of two year s that includes an appreciable amount of elective time, or in a more condensed period with less electiv e time. The clinical clerkships take advantage of Mount Sinai's superb facility and the diversity of experience provided by our affiliated hospitals -- e.g. Elmh urst, Bronx VA, North General, Queens General, St. Barnabas-NJ, Englewood, Cabrini, etc. -- as well as in the community settings, physicians' practice groups, and Mount Sinai's own outpatient settings. That assignment is usually by lottery, but MD/PhD students who have a Program -related reason to request a specific rotation will be accommodated. Careful planning, in consu ltation with the clinical advisors and MD/PhD directors, will afford students the smoothest transition back to clinical medicine. Enough flexibility also exists so that elective time may be shifted to the beginning of an academic year to allow an MD/PhD student to finish up experime ntal or dissertation work. Thus students are readily able to enter clerkships at various tim es between July and November. Many students will have completed the requirements without loss of a ny or a substantial amount of clinical elective time. They may, and often do, choose to spend so me of that elective tim e in the laboratory, continuing offshoots of their projects. Several ot her students have used some of their elective time during the final phase of the Program to expl ore research programs elsewhere, e.g., at the NIH. Students entering the fourth MD year should investigate the USMLE time limit set by some states for taking Step III. Students s hould check the USMLE website (www.usmle.org) for further details. MD/PhD st udents should refer to the Medi cal Student Handbook for further details on the USMLE, information on clinical career choices and residency programs. 1.3 Master Programs Master of Biomedical Sciences The Master of Biomedical Sciences program ta kes advantage of the multidisciplinary research education programs on our campus, the commitment to translation of fundamental findings in basic biomedical sciences to applications in the prevention of disease and novel therapies for disease, and the commitment to prepare studen ts to contribute to various aspects of the biomedical enterprise. This pr ogram responds to the recognized need for generalist graduate study in the medical sciences to provide students with the bac kground essential for the pursuit of a variety of careers in the heal th professions, whether in doctora l programs in research and/or clinical medicine or for employme nt in the for-profit sector. The MS in Biomedical Sciences is a full-time co urse of study requiring a minimum of 45 credits. The first year will ensure master y of fundamental core concepts in contemporary cellular and molecular biomedical sciences, application of st atistical principles to experimental design and data analysis, responsible conduct of research, an d critical analysis and presentation of primary research literature in the biomedical sciences . In addition, a significant amount of time will be spent doing research in a laboratory, which will have been carefully chosen in consultation with the Program Director. Course work in the third term will be devoted to advanced elective study in the student's chosen area of interest as well as continued work on a research project, which 12 will form the basis for a Master's thesis. Students in this program will be taught together with incoming first-year PhD students in their core courses and will be integrated into the total academic and social environment of the Graduate School of Biological Sc iences. The program is intended for students who are not ready to make a 5-year commitment to obtain a PhD or who need to bolster their competitiveness for MD or MD/PhD programs and who value structured advanced education and research training in the biomedical sciences. We expect that student s will be able to complete degree requirements in 3 terms, with an option to c ontinue their research for a four th term without additional tuition payments. Students will pursue basic science research under the tutelage of a mentor. Each student project is expected to culminate in a co-authorship of a pa per to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Selection of a research laborator y and mentor occurs during the first month in the program and the choice is finalized no later than October 1. Master of Science in Genetic Counseling The Genetic Counseling Program is a 21-month, full-time course of study designed to train future genetic counselors through intensive cour sework and a variety of clinical placements. The Program is sponsored by Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, a large multidisciplinary center providing clinical and laboratory services to a wide range of patients and familie s. The faculty is on the forefront of research in the diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders and has pr oven a commitment to the field of genetic counseling and to the communities they serve. The integration of academic and clinical disciplines within one of the c ountry's preeminent medical center s provides an ideal environment for this Master's Program, affording our stude nts unparalleled opportuni ties for study, research, and practice in the challenging and exciting fiel d of human genetics a nd genetic counseling. Students must complete the core curriculum. St udents are also require d to rotate through a variety of clinical settings from prenatal to pediatric to adult genetics. These rotations provide opportunities for extensive supervised experience in history taking, interviewing, psychosocial assessment, and genetic risk assessment. Candidates for the Master of Science in Genetic Counseling must complete an in-depth study of a selected genetic counse ling issue or topic. Students are st rongly encouraged to study topics appropriate for national presenta tion and/or publication. Follow ing graduation, the Counselor is eligible for the American Board of Gene tic Counseling Certification Examination. The Program is accredited by the American Board of Genetic Counseling. Master of Public Health The Master of Public Health de gree is a two-year program that prepares students for careers in public health. Applicants to the Program must have a Bachelor's Degree from an accredited college or university. For complete program descri ption and application mate rials please visit the website at: http://www.mssm.edu/education/gradua te-school/degrees -and-programs/mph-13 program Certificate, Master of Science, and Ph.D. in Clinical Research The Clinical/Translational Rese arch Training Programs of The Mount Sinai Graduate School of Biological Sciences are designed to foster the development of futu re leaders in patient oriented research. These training opportuni ties are intended to encourage the development of critical thinking necessary to conduct i nnovative hypothesis dr iven, independent and collaborative clinical/translational scientific research, in an ef fort to improve patient care and the wellbeing of society. In particular, we hope to enhance the resear ch opportunities of clini cal scientists as well as enhance the ability of basic sc ientists to better position themselves to translate the promise of their respective discoveries into th e clinical arena, in a meaningful way with significant impact. A rigorous curricular foundation designed to prom ote an in depth understanding of research methodologies and processes essential to transla ting the promise of scientific discovery into solving problems of disease is ce ntral to these educational initia tives, and forms the basis of our Certificate Program, Masters of Science in Clinic al Research, and Ph.D. in Clinical Research.

Admissions 2.1 PhD Program Students who have, or will have completed baccalaureate programs and who wish to pursue a doctoral degree in biomedical sciences rese arch should apply online and submit required documents for consideration. Most applicants have completed the following courses: general biology, general chemistry, general physics, or ganic chemistry (2 semesters), mathematics (through integral calculus), and an introductory course in bioche mistry. In special instances some of these requirements may be waived as a prerequisite for admi ssion. Arrangements will have to be made to take them later, e.g., bi ochemistry may be taken during the summer before matriculation. In addition, it is desi rable for applicants to have ta ken advanced science courses. It is very important for applican ts to have had basic science res earch experience. Letters from research mentors and written comments from the applicant about prior research experience are major components of th e application file. Students who wish to transfer from another inst itution to a Mount Sinai degree-granting program must apply for admission through the regular Mount Sinai application pro cess. Students who have completed the qualifying exam for their PhD at another institution will be required to pass the thesis proposal exam at Mount Sinai. St udents who have passed their PhD thesis proposal exam at another institution cannot transfer to a Mount Sinai PhD program. The deadline for receipt of completed application packets is January 1, but early submission is highly recommended for full competition for fellowships. Applicants should indicate their field(s) of greatest interest. In addition to the application form and require d fee, the applicant must supply official final transcripts from all institutions attended, thre e letters of recommendation, and official scores in the Graduate Record Examin ations (verbal, quantit ative, analytical). Applicants for whom English is not the first lang uage must submit official scores of the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language). Applican ts who have received a bachelor's degree in the United States need not submit TOEFL result s. Applicant's who, on the basis of their submitted application materials, are being seriously considered for the Program, will be invited for interviews. The requirement for these in terviews may be exchanged for a telephone interview, if geographical considerations are overwhelming. The Admissions Committee of the Graduate School will consider all the data on each applicant before making its decision. 2.2 MD/PhD Program Extramural applicants who have decided to pursu e studies towards both degr ees first apply to the Mount Sinai Medical School through the AMCAS a pplication. They elaborate on their interest in the MD/PhD program on a subsequent Mount Sinai Medical School admission application form and by submitting the research-oriented MD/PhD online application form as part of the Medical School application packet. In addi tion to the minimum subject requirements for admission to the Medical School, the applicant mu st have had research experience and should have taken advanced courses in science (e.g., phy sical chemistry, genetics, biochemistry). The MD/PhD application form is the only written mate rial that must be submitted in addition to the 15 application materials to the Medical School. The applicant must submit 3 letters of recommendation from research advisors and GRE scores Based on the application materials, a group of hi ghly qualified applicants will be selected for interview. Admission to the MD/PhD program requires acceptance by the MD/PhD Admissions Committee. An applicant may be admitted to th e Medical School without being admitted to the MD/PhD. Students who are considering gra duate studies in addition to me dical school, but who are not yet sure about matriculation in the MD/PhD progr am, have the option of applying to the dual program during the first or second year in the Mo unt Sinai Medical School. They would then be applying to the doctoral program after they have had exposure to medical studies and have had an opportunity to further define their future plan s. Such students should identify themselves to the MD/PhD Director as early as possible. The deadline for receipt of comple ted application packets is Decem ber 15 but early submission is highly recommended. 2.3 Master's Degree Programs Master of Biomedical Sciences Applications are invited from students who have completed their undergraduate degree with a major in the sciences. App licants should have a minimum GPA of 3.0 and some prior independent research experience. The Program ad mits only students who wish to pursue the MS degree on a full-time basis. Admission is based on the applicant's academic records, prior MCAT or GRE scores, past research experience, letters of recommendation, and personal statement regarding ultimate career plans. Application deadline is June 1; application revi ew will begin on April 15. Master of Science in Genetic Counseling Students who will be considered for admission must have completed a baccalaureate or graduate program at a college or univers ity of high standing and should ha ve a strong background in basic and social sciences including genetics, biology, chemistry, biochemistry, psychology, and statistics. Experience in a communication or support organization is recommended. In addition to the application form and supportin g documents, applicants are required to submit GRE scores for the general exam. Completed ap plications should be received by January 15 th. Competitive applicants are subsequently invited to interview with our faculty and students. Applicants are informed of the Admission Committee's decision in the spring. All applicants to the Graduate School are considered on the basis of their total merit. The school does not discriminate on the basis of sex, race, color, creed, religion, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, marital status, sexual orientation, or citizenship status, in accordance with institutional policy and in compliance with the requirements of the Civil Rights Act, the Education Amendments, the Rehabilitation Act, the Age Discrimination Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. 16 3. Financial Support 3.1 Stipend and Tuition All MD/PhD and PhD students are offered a stipend, the full cost of tuition and a comprehensive health insurance package. Continuation of this support is conti ngent upon maintaining satisfactory progress (see secti on on Satisfactory Progress) in th e Program at all times. The Program reserves the right to discontinue support in the absence of such progress. The stipend for annual year 2011-12 is $32,500 and is adjusted peri odically as the school endeavors to enable its students to keep pace with expenses and rising costs. During their early training, stude nts are supported by the Graduate School from some source of generalized funds, including training grants and in stitutional fellowships. This allows them to complete the General Program Requirements and to choose a dissert ation advisor and a Multidisciplinary Training Area without concern fo r source of support. Af ter this time, it is expected that the dissertation advisor will be responsible for the stipend, tuition support, and health insurance for the student if he/she is not supported by a Traini ng Grant or individual fellowship. Students are encour aged to apply for individual fellowships from extramural sources. Students who are awarded a fellowshi p receive from the Graduate School for the duration of the award an additional $2,000 annual bonus. For PhD students, stipend support will end on the day the student deposits his/her diss ertation. For MD/PhD students, stipend support will end on the day the student receives his/her fi nal degree, but health insurance coverage will continue until June 30 of the year they receive their final degree. The Master of Biomedical Sciences program co mprises 45 credits and is billed at $850/credit (2011-12). Tuition is only charged for courses taken at M ount Sinai. Students w ho are granted transfer credit for courses taken at other institutions, may apply for tuition credit on a per credit basis. Non-matriculated students may also enroll in course s that are part of a Master's program at the tuition rate charged by that program. 3.2 Travel Award Students are encouraged to apply for a competitiv e Travel Award from the Mount Sinai Alumni Travel Fund. Students who plan to attend a meeting and present a poster and/or talk are eligible to apply. Students who are interested in taki ng a particularly meritorious course that will enhance their research program are also eligible to apply for a Graduate Student Travel Award. The Graduate Student Travel Awards Committee will review and make recommendations based on the merit of the application. Awards will ra nge from $200 to $600. Each student will be eligible for one award per calendar year. The aw ard is only applicable for travel taking place while the student maintains student status and is in good academic standing in the School. There are four deadlines for submission of applications each year. NB: The Graduate School reserves 17 the right to change this schedule. All students an d faculty will be notified of such changes, via e- mail, prior to the effective dates of such changes. Travel Period Application Submission Award Notification September 1 to October 31 July 15 August 1 November 1 to February 28 September 15 October 1 March 1 to May 31 January 15 February 1 June 1 to August 31 April 15 May 1 In addition to these deadlines and travel peri ods, one large award (up to $2,500) may be made each year. This award will be granted on a compe titive basis to a student who proposes a trip outside the USA for the purpose of presenting a paper at a high imp act meeting or for attendance at a unique course that would greatly impact his/her program of study. Application for this award must be made by September 15 for travel during the school year. Applications that do not follo w this schedule will only be considered under extenuating circumstances. It is the student 's responsibility to submit relevant information to be considered by the Committee. Incomplete applications w ill not be considered for funding and will be returned to the student following the notification date. Students will be notified of the Committee' s decision via e-mail by the Graduate School administration. Once an application has been ap proved, students must complete an online Mount Sinai Travel Request form at l east two weeks prior to the depart ure date. The form must have the dissertation advisor's funding source for the por tion of travel that is not funded by the Travel Award. Students will be respons ible for making their own travel arrangements, paying for their expenses, and then submitting their request for reimbursement upon their re turn. All original receipts and a Travel Voucher Form must be completed and signed by the dissertation advisor and student before being submitted for reimbur sement. The signed travel voucher must be submitted to the Graduate School's Financial Ad ministrator no later than two weeks after the return date from the trip. At that time the st udent must also submit a paragraph or two about his/her participation, impressions and accomplishmen ts of the meeting/course. The description should indicate how attendance to this meeting/ course contributed to the enhancement of the student's program of study. Failure to submit all required paperwork in ac cordance with these established deadlines would void the award. Advance funds are not available prior to travel. 3.3 Guidelines Concerning \"Supplement al Work-in-Another-Department\" It is Graduate School policy that all students be supported at the same stipend level for the activities involved in their traini ng program and that their program activities represent a full-time commitment. There are a variety of cogent reas ons - fairness being one of them - for this policy. Nonetheless, there are students whose personal circumstances require them to seek 18 additional funds. Students should co ntact the Financial Aid Office fo r additional information. If necessary, the Graduate School Offi ce will try to help find jobs that conflict as little as possible with the student's program and complement th e student's educational advancement. If a dissertation advisor strongly wishes to help a st udent with a unique need to secure additional funds, it is required that the stud ent be assigned specific, documenta ble activities that are distinct from those involved in the training program for which the extra funds will be earned (\"supplemental work in other department\"). Such arrangements must, furthermore, be approved in advance by the Dean of the Graduate School. Failure to do so will jeopardize the student's total funding package. 3.4 Teaching Assistantship Many courses in the medical school and graduate school offer teachi ng assistantships to qualified students. Teaching assistantship activities may in clude videotaping of l ectures, discussion-group leadership, holding review sessions, tutoring of students in course wor k, laboratory preparation, supervision, and cleanup and assis ting in the preparation and grad ing of problem sets and/or examinations. The course director and student would work out the specifics of the assistantship together, and will vary from course to course. Students may get paid for being a teaching assistan t or may receive credit on their transcript, but not both. A maximum of one credit per semester for assisting in teaching activities is available. These credits will not count towa rd the total number of credit hours required for the MS or PhD degree. Approximately 30 clock hours of work during a semester is expected of a student earning one hour of credit. A TA Appointment Form must be completed with the instructor's signature before the student can register for the credit. 3.5 Tuition Waiver Tuition is charged for all student s regardless of employee status at Mount Sinai. The only exception to this policy is a Dean's waiver. The Dean of the Graduate School may waive tuition for Mount Sinai employees (e.g., research technici ans) wishing to enroll in basic science PhD level course(s) who have an inte rest in pursuing a PhD in Biomed ical Sciences at Mount Sinai. In such cases, all approvals must be attained and the waiver filed in the Dean's Office one week prior to the first day of class. Process to request a tuition waiver : the employee must have writt en permission from both their Supervisor, approving the activit y, and from the Course Direct or(s), approving the student's enrollment in the course(s). The student will file a written petition to th e Dean of the Graduate School outlining their reason for enrolling in the c ourse(s) and how the course(s) fits into their long-term graduate study. The petition must be accompanied by 1) written permissions from the Supervisor and 2) a Course Permission Form with all the required signatures. The deadline to apply for a waiver is one calendar week prior to the beginning of the cour se(s). The student will be notified prior to the first day of class as to the approval or deni al of their petition. 19 The number of course credits that a non-matriculated student can take from offerings of the PhD degree program in Biomedical Sciences will be lim ited to a total of 9 credits and no more than 9 credits of tuition will be waived. Employees may also take advantage of the Tuition Assistance Program (http://www.mountsinai.org/about-us/careers/benefits ) as part of their benefits program. Tuition reimbursement forms may be picked up at 19 East 98 th Street, second floor room 2D (Training and Education) 3.6 Upperclassmen Student Support by Graduate School Funds Faculty who experience difficulty in funding student s already committed to thesis work in their laboratories ought to take the following steps to secure funding support for the students in question: a) Discuss the issue with their Depart ment Chair to determine whether departmental funds can be applied toward suppor t of the student in que stion; b) If depart mental funds are not available, the faculty member a nd the Chair should notify the Dean of the Graduate School and if deemed appropriate by the Chair, apply for Br idging Funds through the Office of the Dean of MSSM ; c) Should both of these av enues fail, the faculty member should meet with the Dean of the Graduate School to discuss the details of the situation and establish a plan for the student and resumption of funding support by the faculty member . If the student's support is provided by Graduate School funds, the faculty member and th e Dean of the Graduate School will meet every three months to review the funding status and plan accordingly. 20 4. Academic Programs A. PhD Program 4.1 General Program Requirements All PhD and MD/PhD students will be expected to fulfill the following requirements for the PhD degree: Core Curriculum According to MTA requirements Laboratory Rotation At least two rotations (except for transf er/advanced students) must be completed Introduction to Journal Club Two semesters RCR: Responsible Conduct in Research Fall semester, first year (except MD/PhD students who take the course duri ng their first year in their PhD phase) Biostatistics Fall semester, first year (except MD/PhD students who take the course duri ng their first year in their PhD phase) Meet the Authors Two semesters Advanced Coursework To fulfill the requirements of the chosen MTA, students who have successfully completed relevant graduate courses elsewhere will be granted exemption and/or graded credits at the discretion of the Dean, in consultation with the course and MTA Directors). There follows a general descrip tion of these Program elements, including a description of the individual courses, typical MTA requirements, and criteria for advancement to candidacy. This is followed, in turn, by a section on Program Progress Po ints that details the criteria for satisfactory progress through Completion of th e Core Curriculum and other Ge neral Program Requirements, and for approaching and successfully completing the three oral examinations that are part of the Program: the General Knowledge Examination , the Thesis Proposal , and the Dissertation Defense . The Program requirements for the Genetic Counseling Program can be found following the section on Multidisciplinary Training Area Requirements. 21 4.2 Laboratory Rotation Laboratory rotations are an important part of th e first year of the Graduate Program at Mount Sinai. They give students the opportunity to experience different resear ch projects, different laboratory and mentoring styles, an d allow the faculty to assess the interests and aptitude of the students. All PhD and MD/PhD students must comp lete two laboratory rota tions (in two different laboratories, and at times a third or a fourth ro tation is required) before declaring a dissertation advisor and a Multidisciplinary Training Area. If incoming students were research technicians in a Mount Sinai laboratory prior to becoming a graduate student, they may choose their former employer as their dissertation advisor, but only after rotating in at l east one other laboratory. The rotation facilitates the choice of dissertation advisor and al so offers students an exposure to problems and techniques of interest to them. Grading of rotations will be on a Pass/Fail basis . For each semester, the student should submit the na me of the rotation advisor and start date of the rotation no later than the beginning of the semester. This is done via the submission of the Rotation Agreement Form. A typical rotation time is 9-13 w eeks during the academic year and 6-8 weeks in the summer. Once a student has completed a rotation, the Rotation Evaluation Form must be filed by both student and faculty. Summer rotations preceding matriculation must be at least six weeks long (s tart the first week in July). Students will be required to make a formal pr esentation in an appropriate venue following the first rotation and following either the second or third rotation. To facilitate and optimize the rotation experience for both the student and the faculty mentor, it is important that this student-faculty pair meet prior to the start of the rotation to discuss expectations, goals, requirements and laboratory guideli nes. The discussion should be recorded on the Laboratory Rotation Agreement Form so that both the student and the rotation advisor are in agreement about what each expects from the other. The Form must be submitted to the Graduate School at the beginning of each rotation. During the laboratory rotation, the student has to be aware of th e balance that needs to be maintained between research and study time fo r ongoing courses. Students are expected to spend about 50% of their time (about 20 hours/week) on the laboratory rotation. Good time management can optimize the experience in that pa rticular laboratory. The student should select a laboratory only after s/he has met with the mentor and discussed expectations, goals, and motivation. At the end of each rotation, the student and rotation advisor should discuss the rotation experience and the rotation a dvisor must complete the Laboratory Rotation Evaluation Form , which must be submitted to the Graduate School at the end of each rota tion. In general, the 22 evaluations from the first three ro tation advisors (two if only two rotations are completed prior to declaration of the dissert ation advisor) will determine the composite grade (Pass or Fail) assigned for the Rotations. Students who are unable to find a lab by the end of their fourth rotation will automatically go before the Graduate School Promotions Committ ee for review. Outcomes of this review could include dismissal from the program if it is dete rmined that the student is unlikely to find a suitable laboratory in a reasonable timeframe. 4.3 Advisory Mechanisms Entering students are assigned a graduate facu lty advisor who will handle student questions about courses, rotations or problems that surface throughout the first year. This faculty advisor is generally from the first choice MTA on the stud ent's application to the Graduate Program. In cases where the student is unsure about their choice of MTA, a second advisor from another MTA may be assigned. Once a student selects a dissertation advisor a nd a Multidisciplinary Training Area, with the help of the dissertation advisor, he/she selects an Advisory Committee, which is comprised by two expert faculty in the fi eld of study and one facu lty in a related field but who is considered not to be an expert in the student's field of study. This Advisory Committee should meet at least once a year. All Advisory Committee members must be members of the Graduate Faculty. Students and faculty are urged to understand that the advisory system is their strongest ally in identifying and helping to resolve problems, in maintaining a realistic set of expectations for progress, and as a source of extra ideas and ne w approaches. Students sh ould take the initiative in scheduling meetings. Timely meetings are imperative. Students should recognize that their thesis advi sor is usually their most important mentor, who can not only advise the student on research directions, but may also provide career guidance. It is expected that thesis advisors provide opportu nities for the student to develop independence, encourage the student to participate in collabo rations, presentations, de partmental seminars, introduce the student to colleagues, help the student to learn about writing and submitting manuscripts for publication, help the student to identify and work with their strengths and weaknesses and be committed to help the student make the next move in their career development. However, other faculty who take pa rticular interest in th e student's growth and development as scientists may often also serve as important mentors. Students are encouraged to develop relationships with any faculty whom they feel can provide signif icant research, career, and personal guidance. Formal progress reports must be filed twice annu ally with the Graduate School Office. To meet this requirement, students are expected to meet at least once each year with the full Advisory Committee. All students will receive Progress Form s twice each year according to the schedule indicated on the Calendar. The student should re view the Progress Form and correct/update as necessary. The Advisory Committee should use the la st page of the Progress Form to evaluate the student's progress, clearly identify stre ngths and weaknesses and indicate plans for development. All members of the Advisory Comm ittee should then sign and date the Progress 23 Form. It should then be returned to the Gradua te School Office by the set deadline. Note that Progress Forms are due four weeks after distribution. When a student fails to demonstrate satisfactor y academic progress, the Program Director may mandate more frequent advisory committee meetings. The final Advisory Committee meeting should take place at least 3 months before the anticipated thesis defense. Students should update their list of publications and manuscripts in press on the Progress Report form before this meeting. At this meeting, the Advisory Committee will certify that the student is ready to writ e their dissertation and to schedul e a defense of their dissertation, if the student has at a minimum achieved the following: mastery of the literature, conceptual skills, analytical skills, wr iting and presentation skills, experimental skills, record keeping skills and work ethic meets doctoral-level standards intellectual contributions as a lead author, or equivalent, to at least one manuscript, published or in press, in a peer-reviewed j ournal. An exception to this requirement will require the unanimous approval by the Advisory Committee. 4.4 Choice/Change of Dissertation Advisor and Multidisciplinary Training Area The choice of a dissertation advi sor and Multidisciplin ary Training Area (MTA) is a major focus of the first year of the Program. The year cu lminates with the student being accepted into the laboratory of a Graduate Faculty member for pursuit of the dissertation work. Together with that faculty member, the student decides on the MTA in which the advanced coursework, seminars and journal clubs, and the General Knowledge Examination will be completed. Students are urged to take full advantage of their rotation expe rience during the first year . Faculty mentors of rotation students are urged to present a realistic pi cture of the tone of the laboratory, the nature of the ongoing projects, how work is assigned or m onitored, and any general history or policies with respect to meetings, publications/authorship, weekly journal clubs and laboratory meetings, and direct contact to be expected with the laboratory leader. A choice of dissertation advisor is usually, but not always, consona nt with the MTA choice. Following the end of the second semester in th e Program, each PhD student should complete the Declaration Form . MD/PhD students complete this form following the fourth semester in the Program. At this time, the student should al so select a three-member Advisory Committee whose members will be most helpful in the di ssertation project. A dvisory Committee members must be members of the Graduate Faculty. Two Advisory Committee members should be experts in the area of the student 's research; a third member shoul d be from a related field but need not be expert in the stude nt's area of research. MD/PhD students are encouraged to add a clinical/translational (C/T) investigator, who need not be a member of the Graduate Faculty, to their Advisory Committee to provide feedback ab out the C/T impact of their research. This Form should be submitted to the Graduate School Office with all the required signatures as soon as possible, but no later than June 30 . One indication of satisfactory pr ogress in the Program is the de monstration of the potential for research and the timely selection of a mentor a nd MTA. PhD students are expected to declare a 24 dissertation advisor and MTA no later than 12 months after matricul ation. MD/PhD students are expected to declare by the end of the second year in the Program. The choice of a dissertation advi sor by the student and the accepta nce of that student by the future dissertation advisor should be considered a commitment on the part of both parties that the student will remain with the chosen dissertation a dvisor until the thesis is completed. If a student is contemplating a change in dissertation adviso r or MTA, or, if the dissertation advisor is unsatisfied with the academic progress of the st udent, mediation should be sought to remedy this situation by first meeting with the MTA Director and the student's Advisory Committee. If necessary, the Dean of the Graduate School may al so meet with the student and their dissertation advisor. Movement between MTAs is permitted if the student is certified, in writing by the MTA Director(s), to be in good academic standi ng by the original MTA and is accepted, in writing, by the proposed MTA. Stude nts who are contemplating a cha nge must discuss this fully with the current di ssertation advisor. These changes inva riably involve some loss of time and dislocation to both student a nd dissertation advisor and possibly extra coursework. Careful guidance by the student's Advisory Committee will reduce the number of such changes and will increase the likelihood that thos e changes that do occur are productive. The student should also complete and submit a Change Form to the Graduate School Office. Following are guidelines applicable only to stud ents whose dissertation advisor relocates to another institution: Students who have successfully comp leted their thesis proposal with a given dissertation advisor, who subsequently relocates to another institu tion, will be permitted to pursue their graduate research off-site at their mentor's new institution. If the student has passed his/her thesis propos al exam, the student may wish to leave Mount Sinai to join his/her dissertation advisor at the ne w institution to continue his/her thesis research project. Under these circumstances, the student will continue to be a Mount Sinai matriculated student and will continue to receive student benefits (access to lib rary, housing, health insurance). Any publications resulting from the student's research that was performed at Mount Sinai, before the student left the institution, should list Mount Sinai School of Medicine as the institutional affiliation of the student. 4.5 The Multidisciplinary Training Areas (MTA) Cancer Biology (CAB) Program Directors: James J. Manfredi , Ph.D. and Matthew program combines research in the biology of cancer with a curriculum that challenges trainees to consider how their resear ch may be translated into improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. 25 Developmental and Stem Cell Biology (DSCB) Program Directors: Margaret H. Bar on, M.D./Ph.D. and Robert Krauss, Ph.D. Steering Committee: Margaret H. a fundamental question: how do organisms develop from zygotes? As a discip line, developmental biology encompa sses genetics, cell biology, physiology and evolution; as an area of current biomedic al research, it provides insights into complex processes that, when disrupte d, result in disease. Genetics and Genomic Sciences (GGS) Program Directors: Shaun Pu rcell, Ph.D. P Committee: George Ph.D.; Robert J. Desnick, M.D., Ph.D. This program offers students the opportunity to conduct research in the areas of genome organization and evolution, mechanisms of gene regulation, informatics and genome analysis, gene discovery and characterization, the molecu lar pathology of genetic diseases, and gene therapy. All organisms and gene tic mechanisms are included. Immunology (IMM) Program Directors: Konstantina Al exandropolous, Karen Zier, Ph.D. The goal of this training area is to provide st udents who are interest ed in immunology with a rigorous and flexible program. Students will be given the individual intellectual and technical skills required to become outstanding scie ntists in the field of immunology. Microbiology (MIC) Program Benjamin tenOever, Peter Palese, Ph.D. This program provides research training in ar eas such as antivirals, autoimmune disease, bacterial genetics, environmental microbiol ogy, gene therapy, immunol ogy, molecular virology, oncogenesis (cellular/viral) , nucleic (NEU) Program Directors: Stephen R.J. Ph.D. Committee: Patrizia Casaccia, Deanna Ehud Kaplan, Ph.D.; Klaudiusz R. Weiss, Ph.D. The goal of this graduate program is to provide a broad background in the field of neuroscience, from molecules to behavior, wh ile allowing the student to focu s on the research project in a specific area such as molecular neur obiology, neurochemistry, neuroendocrinology, neuroanatomy, and neurophysiology, among others. 26 Systems Biology of Disease and Therapy (SBDT) Program Director: Jeanne Hirsc h, Iyengar, Ph.D.; This program will train students in integrated approaches to a systems level of understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of human diseases and how key molecules and pathways can be targeted for therapeutic purposes. Structural/Chemical Biology a nd Molecular Zhou, Ph.D. This program will provide an educational environment in which students receive training in structural and chemical biology with an eye to wards the discovery and design of new compounds with the capacity to modulate the function of selected biological systems, e.g., the output of a signaling pathway or the cell-fate de cision between survival and death. 4.6 Core Curricula All PhD and MD/PhD students must complete a Core Curriculum. The Core Curriculum will vary depending on the training area and the sp ecific PhD degree (Biomedical Sciences or Neuroscience). The Core Curriculum provides the students with a strong se t of general concepts and vocabulary that underpins so much of cutting-edge biomedical research in their area of interest. The majority of students in the PhD in Biomedical Sciences program will complete the Biomedical Sciences, a yearlong course that cons ists of six units. They are: (Fall: Enzymes and Metabolism; Genetics and Genomics and Gene E xpression and Biological Chemistry); (Spring: Cell Biology; Development and Regeneration and Mechanisms of Disease). Some MTAs may require that students take the Core III course. Some students may choose to enroll in the Syst ems Biology of Disease a nd Therapeutics (SBDT) training area Core course, instead of the standa rd Core course. Some training areas will accept the SBDT Core as a substitute for the standard Co re. This will be decided on an individual basis and will depend on the student's prior course work. It is possible that some training areas will require that the student take all or part of the st andard Core in their second year, if they took the SBDT Core in their first year. In such a case, the SBDT Core may be count ed as elective credit. Students in the PhD in Neuroscience program must complete the neuroscience core curriculum, which is comprised of Systems and Organiza tional Neurobiology (Fall), Cell and Molecular Neurobiology (Winter), and Neural Basis of Be havioral Plasticity and Cognitive Processes (Spring). In exceptional cases, students who have had prior graduate level c oursework relevant to a Core Curriculum may seek exemption fr om a core course. They should consult the course director(s) 27 who will administer an oral or written exemp tion examination, except in instances in which a strong record of prior graduate coursework has le d to an advanced standing decision at the time of acceptance (see Transfer Credits). Typical curricula for PhD st udents and MD/PhD students ca n be found in section 6.3. 4.7 Seminars and Journal Clubs Seminars and journal clubs are central to the e ducational program. The op portunities to regularly encounter scientists and build cr itical analysis and presentation skills are of ma jor importance. All students are required to partic ipate in seminars and journal club activities during the entire duration of their Program. First-year students will fulfill the journal club re quirement with Introduction to Journal Club (fall and spring semesters) and will generally fulfill the seminar requirement with the Dean's Seminar (fall and spring semesters). They are encouraged to attend additional seminars and journal clubs in areas of their particular interest or in areas that they wish to explore. Advanced students are expected to participate in the journal club and seminar activities of their MTAs and to participate in laboratory journa l clubs and departmental seminars that are recommended by their dissertation advisor. 4.8 Teaching There is no program-wide teaching requirement, but many students seek to take advantage of the opportunities to teach in a variety of modes and settings either b ecause it enforces the mastery of core material, is intrinsically rewarding or becau se it is a major part of their career plans. Teaching opportunities include: teaching assistan tships for the Core courses; teaching assistantships for additional Medical and Graduate School courses; one-on-one tutoring opportunities for graduate or medical courses; tuto ring and special teaching programs at the Life Sciences Secondary School with which Mount Sinai has a special relationship; student mentorships in the RCR course; and student ment orships in the Introduction to Journal Club course. 4.9 Advancement to Candidacy Students will automatically be advanced to candidacy after all the General Program Requirements, the Advanced Coursework for the MTA, the General Knowledge Examination and the Thesis Proposal Exam have been su ccessfully completed. Students who leave the program after having successfully defended their thes is proposal are eligib le for the Masters of Philosophy degree. 28 4.10 Program Progress Points General PhD Program Requirements The maximum time limit for the completion of all requirements for the PhD degree is seven years. PhD students must defend and deposit the dissertation by June 30 of the seventh year in the Program. Students who do not deposit by Ap ril 15 will participate in the graduation ceremony of the following year. All students must be full-time. All stud ents are required to develop a research project, under the supervision of one or more faculty members, which results in a thesis that reports the ne w findings, and is presented, defe nded and deposited. All students must successfully complete all ot her degree requirements that are part of the training program. The choice of the research laboratory, through a series of laboratory rotations (BSR1006 and BSR1007) and academic credit for the thesis project (BSR8000 and BSR9000) are part of each student's academic program. First Year Satisfactory completion of the initial General Program Requirements (i.e., excluding advanced coursework and seminars) will be evaluated at the end of the first year in the Program: General Program Requirements Course Comment Biomedical Sciences two semesters, for most students. Some MTAs require that their students take their Core III course following the two-semester Biomedical Sciences course. Introduction to Journal Club I and II Attendance and participa tion is mandatory for all sessions Neuroscience 3 courses (S ystems and Organizational Neurobiology, Cell and Molecular Neurobiology, and Neural Basis of Behavioral Plasticity & Cognitive Processes) Systems Biology and Disease Therapeutics Systems Biomedicine and two courses chosen from Quantitative Graduate Physiology, Pharmacology or Biomedical Modeling Responsible Conduct of Research Attendance and participa tion is mandatory for all sessions Biostatistics Exempted; or successful completion of BSR1010 Laboratory Rotation At least two rotations must be successfully completed 29 Course Comment Meet the Authors 2 semesters Core Curriculum In order to successfully complete the Core Cu rriculum, the student must achieve an average grade of at least B (3.0) in the Co re course(s). In computing this mean grade, each of the core course grades is given equal weight using th e quality point values indicated below. Grade Quality Point Value A 4.00 A- 3.70 B+ 3.30 B 3.00 B- C C- 1.70 F 0.00 NB The GPA is computed to two deci mal points and is not rounded off. For those MTAs that require their students to take their Core III course, it will then be weighted equally with the Biomedical Sciences course to determine if the student has achieved the required B (3.0). Any student who fails to meet this requirement will be reviewed by the Graduate School's Promotion Committee. 4.11 Registration for the General Knowledge Exam, Thesis Proposal and Dissertation Defense/Seminar To schedule the General Knowledge Exam (or re-examination), Thesis Proposal (or re- examination), or the Dissertation Defense and Se minar, the dissertation advisor and the student should check the proposed date and time with the Examination Committee members before submitting the appropriate Registration Form to the Registrar's Office. The student needs to submit an official Registration Form, with the ap propriate signatures, to the Graduate School for approval, at least 4 weeks before the scheduled dates of these Exam inations. Failure to register in a timely manner may result in the cancellation of the Examination. If a student does not register for an Examination that is conducted, the Graduate School reserves the right to require a re-examination or to require a notarized stat ement from the student and the Examination Committee certifying the number of times the st udent has been examined. The Registrar's Office will forward the appropriate official Voting Form to the Chair of the Examination Committee. This Form has to be signed a nd returned immediately following the General Knowledge Examination (or re-examination), Thesis Proposal (or re-examination), or 30 Dissertation Defense to the Gra duate School Office. If the Committee determines that a re- examination must occur, or that revisions must be made to the Thesis Proposal, the details, including a deadline within the allowable time, must be attached to the Voting Form. This information should also be communicated to the st udent, in writing. In the case of the Defense, if there are revisions to be made, the Gra duate School Office will forward the appropriate Revisions Form to the Chair of the Committee. NO EXTENSIONS WILL BE GRANTED EXCEPT UNDER EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES. Requests for extensions of establ ished Examination deadlines should be made at least 4 months prior to that deadline, students who fail to meet the Examinations deadlines will be placed on academic probation. 4.12 General Knowledge Exam This exam satisfies the first part of the Preliminary Exam. The second part of the Preliminary Exam is comprised by the Thesis Proposal Exam (see below). Successful completion of both parts of the Preliminary Exam allows doctoral students to advance to candidacy for the PhD Degree at the Mount Sinai Gradua te School of Biological Sciences. Advancement to candidacy means that students are able to totally focus their energy on their thesis work. Objectives The goal of the General Knowledge Exam (Part 1 of the Preliminary Exam) is to evaluate the background knowledge and reasoning skills of the student and determine whether or not the student is sufficiently advanced to proceed with the next phase of doctoral training. Review Essay Once a student has selected a dissertation adviso r, a Multi-disciplinary Training Area (MTA), and an Advisory Committee, s/he will begin work on a project that will ultimately develop into a thesis project. The student should become familiar with the background literature for that project. Any MTA has the option to also assign a selection of recent articles from the literature with which the student should be familiar. These ar ticles may be related to the student's field of study but may also cover different fiel ds that represent the training area. Within three months after selection of a dissert ation advisor for PhD students, or within three months of starting the PhD phase of the MD/PhD program, the student (except those who are in the NEU MTA) should submit a 5-6-page essay on this background material. Examples of the type of acceptable essay include the Mini-reviews in Cell, or reviews in Trends or Current Opinion journals. The essay shoul d include a synthesis of the literature a nd should identify and discuss major open questions in the field. NIH font specifications a nd margin requirements should be followed [Arial, Helveti ca, Palatino Linotype or Georgia typeface and a font size of 11 points or larger; at least one-h alf inch margins (top, bottom, left, and right), single-spaced]. A smaller font size may be used for figures, grap hs, diagrams, charts, tables, figure legends, footnotes, and references, but this type must fo llow the font typeface requirement and be readily legible. The essay should be the student's ow n work; the student's di ssertation advisor may provide guidance and general comments. 31 The student should discuss the plan s for their essay and the oral ex am with the MTA Directors. Some MTAs may opt to waive the essay requirement. The final essay should be submitted to the MTA Di rectors for further evaluation with a copy to the Graduate School Office and if the written essa y is acceptable, the st udent will be notified. The Graduate School Office will schedule the or al exam within two w eeks or at the first possible. This essay will be used as a st arting point for oral questions regarding general knowledge of the scientific issues and research area being pursu ed. At a minimum, the student should display excellent background knowledge an d understanding of the scientif ic issues and key questions relevant to the area of research under consideration. Once such knowledge has been demonstrated, the student's breadth of understanding and ability to integrate knowledge gained in the first-year core curriculum can be further probed. Oral Exam The Oral exam must be completed no later than December 31st of the second year of graduate training for students in the Ph.D . program or December 31st of the third year of training for students in the M.D./Ph.D program. The MTA Direct or, who will serve as Chair of the oral exam committee, will assign two or more additional fa culty members to the student's oral exam committee. Faculty may include members of th e Student's Advisory Committee. Faculty members who have directly colla borated with the dissertation a dvisor, who have co-authored papers or abstracts with the student (except for rotation work that is un related to the current project), or who have been s ubstantially involved in supervis ing the work, cannot serve on the Committee. Each MTA is encouraged to establish a core group of experienced examiners (5-10 or more) to maintain consistent guidelines and e xpectations for both exams. It is advisable to have junior faculty members observe a few exam s before functioning as a member of the exam committee. The Chair for this exam will ensure that all guidelines are follow ed and that the level of the exam is similar to othe r such exams in the MTA. The following policy pertains to the format of the Oral Exam: The student's thesis adviser cannot be presen t during any portion of the General Knowledge Exam. Immediately prior to the exam, the committee will review the student's progress and academic standing; the student is not present du ring this discussion, however, all members of the examining committee should be present. Once this review is completed, the student will be called into the room and the examination will co mmence. The exam should not be confined to material from the core courses or the written document. It should probe the student's depth of fundamental scientific knowledge and assess his/her ability to extend that understanding to develop useful experimental approaches. The general objective of the exam is to evalua te the background knowledge and reasoning skills of the student and determine whether or not the st udent is sufficiently advanced to proceed with the next phase of doctoral traini ng. Particular deficiencies in fundamental background concepts due to lack of appropriate course work should be assessed, so that the st udent is clear on which advanced courses s/he should pursue to fill gaps in his/her knowledge. 32 Once the committee is finished asking questions, th e student will be asked to leave the room. The committee then decides if the student has successf ully passed his/her Oral Exam, or, if there are clear problems, whether the Oral Exam should be retaken. The student will only be permitted one retake of the Oral Exam, with in two months of the first exam. Within 24 hours of the exam (or as soon thereafter as possible), the Chair of the examination committee will meet with the student's mentor to provide a detailed summary of the student's performance. It is critical for the mentoring proce ss that the mentor be fully informed about this. All committee members should sign the Graduate School evaluation form immediately after the conclusion of the Oral Exam. The signed fo rm must be returned to the Registrar. 4.13 Thesis Proposal Content The Thesis Proposal consists of th e presentation, written and oral, of a research proposal that is based on the thesis work alre ady begun by the candidate. A research proposal Is based on the student's own work, not that of the dissertation advisor Should allow the student to organize his/he r thoughts and plans and place them in perspective Should allow the dissertation advisor and the student's Advisory Committee to assess the level of scientific sophistication of the student Should provide both the student and the Committee a measure against which to determine subsequent progress. The Committee should evaluate the student's ability to: evaluate and synthesize relevant literature articulate and elaborate on the aims show and evaluate preliminary data discuss experimental design as it applies to work planned. The Written Document The outline below follows that of the Research Plan sections of a predoctoral fellowship proposal. Students are strongly encouraged to look at samples of successfully funded NIH fellowship proposals that are available in the Gra duate School Office. The Thesis Proposal must be submitted to the Thesis Proposal Review Committ ee at least two weeks in advance of the Oral Presentation. Formatting Instructions Font: Use an Arial, Helvetica, Palatino Linotype, or Georgia typeface, a black font color, and a font size of 11 points or larger. (A Symbol font may be used to insert Greek letters or special characters; the font size requirement still applies. ) Type may be no more than six lines per inch. Page Margins: Use standard paper size (8 \u00bd\" x 11). Use at least one-half inch margins (top, 33 bottom, left, and right) for all pages. Figures, Graphs, Diagrams, Charts, Tables, Fi gure Legends, and Footnotes: You may use a smaller type size but it must be in a black font color, readily legi ble, and follow the font typeface requirement. Color can be used in figures; however, all text must be in a black font color, clear and legible. Research Plan The following four sections comprise the Resear ch Plan. The Research Plan should not exceed 10 pages. The indicated number of page s for each section is a guideline only. Specific Aims (1 page): Describe the hypothe sis(es) you are testing. What are your research objectives? What conclusions coul d be made from your findings? Be concise, clear and logical. Provide an approximate timetable for accomplishing these aims. Your aims are the test of your hypothesis Background/Significance (2 pages): Provide a critical review (Evalu ate! Don't just cite) of the most pertinent work which raised the questi on you are answering, spawned the idea for your plans, made your approach feasible, etc. Critic ally evaluate what others have done. How does your dissertation relate to other problems or areas of biomedical sciences and/or contemporary biology? Identify those concerns . Explain how your hypothesis a nd planned accomplishment fit. This is an opportunity to relate your plans to the ongoing tradition in science and explain why your work is important. Preliminary Studies (2 pages): Describe what you have already accomplished. Where appropriate, provide data, even if prelimin ary. You do not need an enormous amount of preliminary data; it is far better to take this Examination near the beginning of the project. Explain how these results fit in with your plans. Research Design and Methods (5 pages): Describe the primary techniques you will use. Critique them - exactly what will they show? With how much assurance? How will you evaluate them? What kinds of artifacts have been observed or could be expected? Are th e methods adequate to test your hypothesis(es)? Can ot her procedures be applied to achieve the same goals? Why are yours better? The Oral Presentation Since the Committee members will have read the written document before this presentation, the student should use this opportunity to give a brief summary of the particulars of the research and the proposal. This presentation should not be a reiteration of the written proposal and should be limited to 20 minutes, a time limit that should be enforced by the Chair of the Committee. Prior to the presentation, the student should discuss, with the Chair of the Committee, whether s/he would prefer uninterrupted presentation vs. one in which questions will be asked as they arise during the presentation. Of course, if the latt er is chosen, the 20-minute time limit does not apply. If the former format is chosen, there will be a questio ning period following the presentation. In either case, the student should be able to an swer questions about the specifics of the proposal 34 as well as general knowledge of the field as relate d to the proposal. The student should be able to defend the rationale for the particular approach(e s) being used and explain how this will answer the questions being asked. Potential problems should also be anticipat ed with alternative approaches that could be used. Students will not be expected to defend these alternatives in great detail. NB The proposal should be written by the student, not the dissertation advisor. It is the role of the dissertation advisor to guide the stude nt in preparing a coherent, intelligible document to be distributed to the members of the Thesis Proposal Committee. However, the dissertation advisor should also ensure, to the best of her/ his ability, that the proposal is an original document and that the language of the proposal is that of the student. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of th e student to provide an acceptable document. The whole proposal should be in the best trad itions of scholarship, e.g., identify sources, balance your presentation by including conflicting data and counter arguments, etc. The proposal should convince the Committee that the dissertation project is reasonably important and practicable. A student should not present tabl es that are not entirely his/ her own work, unless this is unavoidable because the data are necessary to de velop the story. In that case, the precise contribution of the student must be made clear. Detailed methods should not be presented fo r work not actually conducted by the student, including work done by the Core Facilities or other colleagues; such presentations convey the impression that the student actually carried out the procedures. The Committee The Thesis Proposal Committee is composed of at least 3 members, in addition to the Chair of the Committee (see below). Members of the st udent's Advisory Committee serve on the Thesis Proposal Committee and may appoint additional Co mmittee members, subject to the approval of the MTA Directorship and the Dean. Comm ittee members should represent a breadth of scientific interest s related to the students ' specific area of study. Faculty members who have directly collaborated on the proj ect, who have co-authored papers or abstracts with the student (except for rotation work that is unrelated to the current project), or who have been substantially involved in supervising the work, cannot serve on the Committee. The me ntor of the candidate cannot be a member of the Committee (see below). The Chair of the Committee shall be one of the Co -Directors of the candidate's Multidisciplinary Training Area, or an appointed designee who is a senior faculty member of that MTA. The Chair of the Committee must enforce all rules of the Examination, including those pertaining to the role of the dissertation advisor, as outlined below. 35 The student's thesis adviser may be present duri ng the questioning phase of the Thesis Proposal Defense; however, the adviser MUST remain silent during the question period. Committee members must not direct questions to the diss ertation advisor, and s/ he must not answer questions directed to the student. Students are encouraged to look at samples of recent Thesis Propos als that are available in the Graduate School Office or from the MTA Directorship, before pr eparation is initiated. In addition, each student is strongl y encouraged to discuss the expectations of the MTA Co- Directors as they develop their Thesis Propos al. When the student has written the Thesis Proposal, it should be submitted to each member of the Committee at least ten days before the scheduled presentation. Committee members may reschedule the Examination if not given the appropriate amount of time to prepare. Th e Chair of the Committee should poll the Committee members prior to the presentation to determine if there are major concerns with the written proposal that would warrant a postponement of the presentation. In the event of a postponement, the Graduate School must receive written notifi cation from the Chair of the Committee of the postponement at least two days prior to the sche duled presentation, with a new scheduled date. A presentation will be recorded as \"Unsatisfactory\" if the Graduate School does not receive this notification in time (see further de tails under 'deadline' section). As with the General Knowledge Exam, the thesis adviser should give a su mmary of the student's progress at the beginning. All committee members should be present for this summary, and the student should not be present. Following the question period, the stud ent and thesis adviser should leave the room to allow the committee to discuss the exam results and vote in their absence. Following the discussion phase, the st udent should re-enter th e exam room WITHOUT the adviser for a private conversation with the comm ittee. The student will then be asked to leave and the advisor will be invited to have a privat e conversation with the co mmittee as well. Finally, the student and advisor will meet with the comm ittee together for a discussion of the student's performance and the Chair of the Committee will di scuss the Committee's decision at that time. If the Committee determines further work necessar y, the Chair will provide this information, in writing, to the student. A copy of this memo, de tailing conditions and deadline, must accompany the Voting Form, which should be returned to the Graduate School Office within two days of the proposal presentation. The Chair of the Committ ee will report the discussi on to the dissertation advisor. It is possible for a Committee to consider a st udent's performance satisfactory for the oral presentation of the work achieved and work planned, but still consid er the written proposal to be inadequate (in detail, style, ci tation quality, figure/table/legend presentation, etc.). The student may only be permitted one re-take the oral pres entation, but the Committee may ask for as many revisions of the written proposal as are necessary to achieve a satisfactory proposal. This process can occur under the supervision of a subcommittee and must be co mpleted before the student can be advanced to Candidacy. Deadline All PhD students must complete the Thesis Propos al by the end of their fifth semester in the Program. MD/PhD students must present the Thesis Proposal by the end of the seventh semester in the Program. Students may request an extension under special circumstances by submitting 36 the appropriate form to the Dean of the Gradua te School prior to the deadline for successful completion of the Thesis Proposal. Failure to meet this timetable can resu lt in loss of standing in the Program. The student whose Thesis Proposal is deemed unsatisfactory will usually be given one opportunity to address the partic ular area(s) of weakness. Th e conditions and timing for a re- presentation must be established at the time of the initial presentation. However, it must occur within 4 months of the initial presentation. Th e information concerning a re-presentation should be communicated to the student a nd the Graduate School Office, in writing, within two days of the initial presentation. If the st udent (with support of the me ntor) wishes to change the membership of the Re-Examination Committee from that of the Examination Committee, s/he should discuss this with the MTA co-directors and/or the Dean of the Graduate School, prior to registration for the Re-Examination. In rare in stances, the Committee may refuse the student the opportunity to redress the Proposal -- such instances will involv e students who have failed to show sufficient research progress and ability. 4.14 Dissertation Content Copies of earlier successfully completed Program Dissertations are available for review in the Levy Library. Guidelines for the dissertation deposit can be found on Graduate School Forms website. A student should not present tables or figures that are not entirely his/her own work unless this is unavoidable because the data are necessary to de velop the story; in th at case the precise contribution of the student must be made clear. Detailed methods should not be presented for work not actually conducted by the student, includ ing work done by the Core Facilities or other colleagues; such presentations convey the impression that the st udent actually carried out the procedures. Students who wish to use published manuscripts as the backbone of th eir dissertation text (\"compilation format\") may do so under the following circumstances: a general introduction, literatu re review, and summary are written for the dissertation permission to use the published paper as a dissertation chapter is obtained from the relevant publisher the publication represents both the scient ific work and writing of the student the student must be the firs t author on papers used. Thus, no two students may use the same publication, and it is expected that bot h dissertation advisor and student will be honorable in renouncing this format when c ontributions by multiple co-authors make the specific contribution of the student unclear. A Committee might challenge a dissertation on this basis. 37 multi-author publications must be accompanied by a precise list of a ll work not actually performed by the student. Even better, t hose experiments not conducted by the student should be edited out of the disse rtation chapter and just cited the student must have had a major role in wr iting the manuscripts (this should be certified by the dissertation advisor). If the student did not do the earlier writing, the work should be rewritten by the studen t for the dissertation. If a published paper is used in the dissertati on, copyright approval must be secured from the Journal. A note should be made on the paper in dicating that copyright approval was granted. A paper that has been submitted, but not yet accepted, can be used. But a note should be made on the paper that it was used in a dissertation as partial requirement for the fulfillment of the PhD degree. The thesis must contain a Statement of Authorsh ip page which is available on the forms website. The Committee The Dissertation Committee is composed of five members, including the mentor, who must be a silent observer during the Defense by the student. There must be four voting members on the Committee. Two members will be experts in the field of the stude nt's work but they cannot be collaborators of the mentor. One member should be from outside the field of the project. One additional reviewer, who shall no t be a faculty member of Mount Sinai School of Medicine, will be appointed. This \"outside\" examiner may not ha ve been an active collaborator in the student's work. Additional faculty, such as collaborators of the mentor, may be included as non-voting members on the committee Non-voting Committee members, including faculty from Mount Sinai, are those who have directly collaborat ed on the project co-authored papers or abstracts with the student (except for rotation work that is unrelated to the diss ertation project) been substantially involved in supervising the work. If the student has two dissertation co-advisors, bo th may be present and both must be silent observers during the Defense. In this case, the Committee must consist of four additional members. The Training Area directorship and the Gra duate School Dean must approve the Committee roster, and the former will appoint a senior member of the Committ ee, other than the dissertation advisor, to serve as Chair of the Committee. Th e Dean will invite the outside examiner to sit on the Dissertation Committee and will outline the du ties of the reviewers and of the Committee. When the student has completed the written diss ertation document, it must be read and approved by the Dissertation Committee. The student should submit the Dissertation to each member of the Committee as early as possible, but no later than two weeks before the Defense. Committee members may reschedule the Examination if not gi ven the appropriate amount of time to prepare 38 for it. The Committee shall meet with the student for an oral Defense of the Dissertation. Before the final scheduling of the Defense, it is wise to solicit the approval of the Committee vis-a-vis their sense that the work is complete and appropr iately presented. The student must register for the defense with the Registrar and the Dissertat ion Defense and Seminar Registration form along with the Voting form may be obtained from th e Graduate School office. The student must include with the written document th e Statement of Authorship page. Students and dissertation adviso rs should have been made aw are that revisions and even additional experimental work might be requested by the Dissertation Committee. In either event, the Committee should decide and indicate in writ ing whether the whole Committee needs to be reconvened to consider the new draft or whet her a subcommittee (or ju st the chair of the Committee) may approve the revised draft. The mentor may apply to the Graduate School fo r reimbursement (up to $450) to defray travel expenses for the \"outside\" examiner. A letter of request, from the disser tation advisor, for the honorarium should be submitted to the Graduate Sc hool Office. The letter should include the name of the examiner, his/her soci al security number and mailing a ddress. If the funds are being used to defray the cost of travel, original receipts should be sent with the letter of request. We will prepare and submit the check request. Unless otherwise instructed, the check will be sent directly to the examiner. If th e dissertation advisor/department is covering a portion of the travel expenses, the letter of request should be sent with a check request (and original receipts), prepared by the dissertation advisor/department , indicating the amount and fund number (with appropriate signature) for the portion covered by the dissertation advisor/department. The Graduate School will complete the request a nd forward it to Account s Payable. Unless otherwise instructed, the check will be sent directly to the examiner. The Defense and Seminar In addition to the closed session for the oral De fense, all students must present a 45-60 minute seminar on his/her work, open to the Mount Sinai sc ientific community. It is the student's and dissertation advisor's responsibil ity to appropriately announce the seminar to the \"public\", e.g., via email, at least four weeks prior to the semi nar. Seminars may only be scheduled on days and times designated by the Graduate School. If the seminar is presented before the oral defense, the examiners should be invited to the seminar, but should be asked to refrain from asking questions, except those that will lead to making the seminar mo re interactive with the rest of the audience. More intensive questions will be asked in the actual private defense. Note: It is the student's responsibility to check with th e particular MTA for the scheduling format of the Defense and Seminar. Dissertation Deposit Students should read the Doct oral Thesis Deposit Instruct ions which can be found on the Graduate School Forms website. Once a student has successfully defended the disser tation, made all relevant revisions, and is ready to deposit the Dissertation, s/he should deposit the disserta tion electronically according to the instructions in Doctoral Thesis Deposit Instru ctions document, available from the Library or on the web. Students should submit the Dissertation Defense - Student Checkout form before 39 depositing the dissertation. Failure to do this can result in a delay of the student's graduation. Students who leave the programs with an MPhil de gree are not required to deposit their thesis with the Levy Library. The dissertation may be deposited at any tim e during the year, but the following deposit deadlines and enrollment requirements determine the date of the degree. For the degree to be awarded: You must deposit by: And be enrolled during the: September 30 September 15 Preceding Spring semester January 31 January 15 Preceding Fall semester May (MSSM graduation date) April 15 Current spring semester The degree is awarded on September 30, January 31, or the date of Mount Sinai School of Medicine's annual Commencement in May. St udents depositing by the January or April deadline will receive their diploma at Commen cement. Students depositing by the September deadline, may, at the discretion of the Dean of the Graduate School, participate in the prior May Commencement exercise, but will not receiv e their diploma until after September. By March 1, students must notify th e Registrar of their intent to deposit their thesis on or before the April or September deposit deadlines in order to be included in the Commencement exercises of that year. Commencement information will be sent during the spring semester to the student's last email address recorded with the Graduate School Office. Those students who have a dissertat ion or thesis defense scheduled between April 16th and June 15th MAY be eligible to participate in th e spring Commencement ceremony even though they have not met the April 15th thesis/dissertati on deposit deadline. In cas es where a student is allowed to participate, he/she will not receive a diploma at graduation. After a successful defense, a diploma will be awarded on the next date that degrees are conferred (September 30th, of January 31). Only students in good academic standing will be offered this courtesy. In this case, good academic standing means that all course work has been completed with passing grades and the student's mentor/committee fully expect the student will successfully defend his/her thesis/dissertation prior to June 15th. If either of these criteria is not met, the student will not be allowed to participate in the spring gra duation ceremony. Additionally, any student whose written document or oral defense was not accepta ble to their committee will not be allowed to participate in Commencement until after successfully defending and depositing. If a student fails to deposit their thesis by the end of their sevent h year in the PhD program (6th 40 PhD year for MD/PhD students), their disserta tion advisor must petition the Dean of the Graduate School in writing for permission to ex tend their student status . The petition must include a timetable for completing the dissertati on and must also be signed by the student. It is the dissertation advisor's responsibility to inform the Graduate School Office, in a timely manner, the expected date that financial support will be terminated. PhD students can maintain student status, with the stipend and health benefits covered by the dissertation advisor, after the defens e, according to the following timetable: Defense result Student status can be maintained up to No revisions 5 weeks Minor revisions 5 weeks Major revisions 8 weeks Exceptions to this schedule will only be considered under extenuating circumstances. The dissertation advisor must request this in wr iting to the Dean of the Graduate School. 41 4.15 Program Alumni Mount Sinai is proud of its alumni. Most of the students who complete the PhD program pursue a postdoctoral research-t raining period before entering a mo re permanent position and most of the MD/PhD graduates complete a residency an d/or fellowship. The faculty of the program actively assists and guides the students in identifying an optimal position. After the immediate postdoctoral work, our grad uates have gone on to a gratifying array of research positions in academic, medical, and industrial settings . Alumni of Mount Sinai's Graduate School, both PhD and MD/PhD, hold facu lty positions at colle ges and universities around the country, including Barnard, City Univ ersity of New York, Columbia, Cornell Med, Duke, Einstein, Harvard, McGill U, Med Coll Virginia, Mount Sinai, NY Med Coll, NYU, NYU Med, N Texas State, Northwestern, Ponce Sch Me d (Puerto Rico), Rutgers, St. Joseph Coll, SUNY Upstate, Tuskegee Institute, UC Davis, UCLA, U Colorado Med Ctr, U Conn, U Indiana, U Mass, UMDNJ, U Minnesota, U North Caro lina, U Penn, U Pittsburgh, U Texas, U Washington, Williams, and Yale. Several of our alumni are working in distinguished research institutes such as the National Institutes of Health and Fox Chase. Our alumni are similarly well-represented in research laboratories of ma jor pharmaceutical and other industrial firms, such as Advanced Tissue Sciences, Alliance Pharm, Amgen, Astra, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dupont- M ount Sinai graduates have gravitated towards science writing, patent law, business aspects of science, and public policy areas. Some of the students who complete the PhD program at Mount Sinai find th at their interests have become clinically oriented. For such students the natural next step is sometimes medi cal school. A number of our PhD alumni have accordingly gone on to excellent medical schools, including Mount Sina i School of Medicine, ultimately pursuing careers in academic medicine. The Graduate School maintains a close relationshi p with its graduates. Periodically, alumni return to participate in teaching or seminar activiti es. They join us during site visits and retreats and report on their activities with enjoyable regul arity. The Graduate School alumni are invited to join the Associated Alumni of the Mount Si nai Medical Center, and th ey receive a quarterly bulletin that includes alumni a nd institutional news. Mount Si nai's Graduate School alumni helped establish an emergency fund to help cu rrent students in the event of an emergency financial need. They have also been helpfu l in bringing job opportuni ties at their current institutions to the attention of our students and more recent graduates. The Graduate School has developed an online alumni database for its PhD and MD/PhD graduates. Alumni can view their informati on and update it as often as it is needed. Alumni Association Membership The Mount Sinai Alumni encompasses graduates of Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the Graduate School of Biological Sciences, former in terns, residents and fello ws, as well as past and active members of the basic science and clin ical faculty. The association is dedicated to promoting enduring relationships among members, furthering Mount Sinai's educational and 42 charitable endeavors, and promoting scholarship for students and physicia ns-in-training. Senior students will be asked to enroll in the association upon graduation, and will receive all benefits of membership, but will not be expected to become dues-paying members of the Alumni Association until postgraduate training is comp leted. The Student Council selects a member to serve as student liaison to the Alumni Executive Board; however, student input and participation in alumni-sponsored programs and activities is al ways encouraged. The Alumni Office is located in the plaza of the Annenberg Building. Students ar e welcome to visit the office at any time to speak with staff. B. Master's Degree in Biomedical Sciences 4.16 Curriculum Required course work Core Curriculum All students must complete a core curriculum. The core courses that can be used to satisfy this core curriculum are the following: Fall Semester (4-6 credits) (o ne of the following courses): Biomedical Sciences (5 credits) + In troduction to Journal Club I (1 credit) Systems Biomedicine (6 credits) Systems and Organizational Neurobiology (4 credits) Spring Semester ( at least 6 credits): Biomedical Sciences (5 credits) + In troduction to Journal Club II (1 credit) Or, 2 courses chosen from the following: Winter term (or Spring1): Quantitative Graduate Physiology (3 credits) Systems Pharmacology (3 credits) Cellular and Molecular Ne urobiology) (3 credits) Spring term (or Spring2): Neural Basis of Behavioral Plastici ty and Cognitive Pr ocesses (3 credits) Systems Biology: Biomedical Modeling (3 credits) Other Required First-year Courses : Biostatistics (3 credits) (fall semester) Responsible Conduct of Research (1 credit) (fall semester) Meet the Authors - full year (1 credit fall, 1 credit spring) Elective course work Elective credits may be satisfied with: courses from any of the PhD multi-disciplinar y training areas, including seminars and journal clubs 43 courses from MD program, subject to space av ailability and by permission of the MS in Biomedical Sciences Program Director. All medical school courses are graded P/F. up to 3 credits from the MPH or MS in Clini cal Research by permission of the relevant course directors. If a student wishes to ta ke more than 3 credits from other Master's program course offerings, additi onal tuition will be billed to th e student at that program's tuition rate. Thesis credit Three credits will be given for the MS Thesis in Bi omedical Sciences in the final semester of the program. Students must register fo r thesis credit in the semester in which they wish to deposit their thesis. Research credits Students should sign up for Independent Biomedi cal Sciences Master's Research. The following number of credits will be given: first fall semester (Augus t-December)- 4 credits first spring semester (January-June) - 4 credits second fall semester (July-December, includes summer) - 8 credits Students should select a thesis advisor for thei r research by October 1 of the first semester. Master's students do not do laboratory rotations. The student should disc uss with their thesis advisor the expectations and goals for the research project. The Masters in Biomedical Sciences Research Agreement form should be filled out, signed by both the faculty member and the student, and returned to the Gra duate School Office. If the stude nt realizes that the selected laboratory is not a good match betw een the student and the thesis advisor, a switch to another laboratory should be discussed w ith the Program Director. Master's students should prepare a brief PowerPoi nt talk on their research to be presented at either the March or June Laboratory Rotation Presentations mini-symposium. At the end of the first year, students should fill out the Masters in Biomedical Sciences Laboratory Research Evaluation form with their thesis advisor and return it by July 1 to the Graduate School Office. This form determines th e grade for research cred its in the first year. Credits, GPA MS in Biomedical Science students must comple te a minimum of 45 graduate credits and must achieve a GPA of at least a 3.0. 4.17 Guidelines for Preparation of the Mast er's Thesis in Bi omedical Sciences The Master's Thesis should be based on the student's own work and should, in addition to describing the student's research project, provide a critical re view of the l iterature. The description of the research should be organized in sections similar to those in a journal article. 44 The Written Document With these purposes in mind the following structure and guidelines are suggested. Title Acknowledgements Abstract : Should be 150 words or less Introduction (5-10 pages): Provide a critical review (Evaluate! Don't just cite) of the most pertinent work which raised the question you ar e answering, spawned the idea for your plans, made your approach feasible, etc. Critically ev aluate what others have done. How does your dissertation relate to other pr oblems or areas of biomedical sciences and/or contemporary biology? What question will you be addressing? Methods (5-10 pages): Describe the primary techniques you have used. Do not repeat details of published methods. Results (5-10 pages): Describe what you have accomplished, accompanied by appropriate figures and tables. Discussion (5-10 pages): Examine your results, e xplain their significance and answer the question you posed in the Introduction. The Di scussion section may be combined with the Results. Conclusion/Summary (2-5 pages): Summarize and stat e the significance of your results. References: In the text, cite all references in th e name-and-year system (e.g. Strong and Jones, 1991). The reference list should be a rranged alphabetically by the last name of the first author in a standard format with titles. The student s hould consult standard reference publications for appropriate citation styles. NB The thesis should be written by the student, not the th esis advisor. It is the role of the thesis advisor to guide the student in pr eparing a coherent, intelligible doc ument to be distributed to the members of the Committee. However, the thesis advisor should also ensure, to the best of her/his ability, that the proposal is an original document and that the language of the proposal is that of the student. Ultimately, it is the responsi bility of the student to provide an acceptable document. The thesis should be in the best traditions of scholarship, e.g., identify sources, balance your presentation by including conf licting data and counter argum ents, etc. and practicable. A student should not present tabl es that are not entirely his/ her own work, unless this is unavoidable because the data are necessary to de velop the story. In that case, the precise contribution of the student must be made clear. 45 Detailed methods should not be presented fo r work not actually conducted by the student, including work done by the Core Facilities or other colleagues; such presentations convey the impression that the student actua lly carried out the procedures. Students who wish to use published manuscripts as the backbone of their thesis text may do so under the following circumstances: 1. A general introduction, literat ure review, and summary ar e written for the thesis permission to use the published paper as pa rt of the thesis is obtained from the relevant publisher the publica tion represents both the scie ntific work and writing of the student the student must be th e first author on papers used. 2. Multi-author publications must be accompan ied by a precise list of all work not actually performed by the student. Even be tter, those experiments not conducted by the student should be edited out of the disse rtation chapter and ju st cited the student must have had a major role in writing the manuscripts (this should be certified by the thesis advisor). If the student did not do the earlier writing, the work should be rewritten by the student for the thesis. 3. If a published paper is used in the thesis, copyright approval must be secured from the Journal. A note should be made in the th esis indicating that copyright approval was granted. A paper that has been submitted, but not yet accepted, can be used. But a note should be made on the paper that it wa s used in a Master's thesis as partial requirement for the fulfillment of the MS degree. 4. The thesis text should be double-spaced. Because your thesis will be deposited and copyrighted through UMI Dissertation Publis hing, please refer to more detailed formatting instructions in \"Depositing Your Master's Thesis\" which is part of the Master's Thesis Deposit packet, available fr om the Registrar. You are required to purchase one hardcover copy of your thesis for the Levy Library. One copy will be kept in the Graduate School Office. Y ou may order additional bound copies at your own expense. The Oral Presentation/Defense When the student is ready to defend their thesis, the MS Thesis Defense Registration form must be filled out and returned to the Graduate Sc hool Office. The stude nt should bring the MS Thesis Approval form to the oral presentation/defense. Since the Master's Thesis Review Committee members will have read the written document before this presentation, the student should use th is opportunity to give a brief summary of the particulars of the research and the proposal. This presentation should be limited to 10-15 minutes. Prior to the presentation, the student should discuss, with the Chair of the Committee, whether s/he would prefer uninterrupted presenta tion vs. one in which questions will be asked as they arise during the presentation. Of course, if the latter is chosen, the 10-15 minute time limit does not apply. If the former format is chose n, there will be a questioning period following the presentation. 46 The student should be able to de fend the rationale for the particul ar approach(es) being used and explain how this will answer the questions be ing asked. Potential problems should also be anticipated with alternative approaches that c ould be used. Students will not be expected to defend these alternatives in great detail. The Master's Thesis Review Committee The Master's Thesis Review Committee is composed of at least 3 members. The student's thesis advisor will chair the committee. Other members of the Committee should include faculty knowledgeable in the field of the thesis resear ch. One member should have an appointment outside the thesis advisor's Depa rtment and the other member may be from the thesis advisor's Department. These three members, as well as any additional members the student and his/her thesis advisor may want to add, will be appointed by the Program Director. The Master's Thesis should be submitted to ea ch member of the Committee at least ten days before the scheduled oral presentation. The Committee should evaluate the student's ability to: evaluate and synthesize relevant literature defend the methods used articulate and elaborate on the experiments described discuss the significance of the work and potential future research directions justify your conclusions Revisions recommended by the Committee must be co mpleted in a timely fashion. The student's thesis advisor should approve the revised thesis before it is depos ited. The student should make note of the deadlines described below for final de posit of the thesis and dates that the MS degree will be awarded. The thesis must be deposited by the end of the semester in which the thesis defense takes place. The student will maintain student status until the thesis is deposited. Deadlines The thesis may be deposited at any time duri ng the year, but the following deposit deadlines determine the date of the degree. For the degree to be awarded: You must deposit by: September 30 September 15 January 31 January 15 May (MSSM graduation date) April 15 The degree is awarded on September 30, January 31, or the date of Mount Sinai School of Medicine's annual Commencement in May. Students depositing by the January or April deadline will receive their diploma at Commencement. Students depositing by the September deadline, 47 may, at the discretion of the Dean of the Gr aduate School, participate in the prior May Commencement exercise, but will not receiv e their diploma until after September. By March 1, students must notify th e Registrar of their intent to deposit their thesis on or before the April or September deposit deadlines in order to be included in the Commencement exercises of that year. Commencement information will be sent during the spring semester to the student's last email address recorded w ith the Graduate School Office. Those students who have a dissertat ion or thesis defense scheduled between April 16th and June 15th MAY be eligible to participate in th e spring Commencement ceremony even though they have not met the April 15th thesis/dissertati on deposit deadline. In cas es where a student is allowed to participate, he/she will not receive a diploma at graduation. After a successful defense, a diploma will be awarded on the next date that degrees are conferred (September 30th, of January 31). Only students in good academic st anding will be offered this courtesy. In this case, good academic standing means that all course work has been completed with passing grades and the student's mentor/committee fully expect the student will successfully defend his/her thesis/dissertation prior to June 15th. If either of these criteria is not met, the student will not be allowed to participate in the spring gra duation ceremony. Additionally, any student whose written document or oral defense was not accepta ble to their committee will not be allowed to participate in Commencement until after successfully defending and depositing. Instructions for prep aring the MS thesis deposit can be found in MS Thesis Deposit Instructions on the Graduate School Forms website. When th e student is ready to deposit the Master's Thesis, s/he should deposit the thesis electronical ly according to the instructions in the Deposit Instructions document within three calendar year s of the date of initial matriculation in the Graduate School. After depositing the thesis, th e student can request an interim confirmation testifying to the completion of the degree requirements. 4.18 Master's to PhD Master in Biomedical Sciences students may seek entry into the PhD in Biomedical Sciences program or the PhD in Neuroscience program. Master's students seeking en try into one of the Ph.D. pr ograms must complete all the requirements for admission, including a new applicat ion and personal statement that explains the reason for undertaking pursuit of the Ph.D. degree. The applica tion deadline is January 1, for entry in the following fall semester. Official tran scripts and test scores previously submitted to the Graduate School may be used in support of the new application, but must be supplemented by official transcripts for any academic course work taken since entering the Graduate School. Two new letters of recommendation must be subm itted. Students who wish to continue their research in the same laboratory as their Ma ster's research, must include a letter of recommendation from their thesis advisor stating that s/he is willing to have the student join his/her lab for PhD dissertation research. Howeve r, students must rotate in at least one other laboratory before starting their di ssertation research in their MS thesis advisor's laboratory. 48 Most or all of the credits earned in pursuit of the M.S. degree can also be applied towards Ph.D. degree requirements, so students who begin thei r studies in a Master's program can later complete a Ph.D. program with minimal loss of time. If the student wishes to complete and receive the Master's degree befo re starting the Ph.D. program, this request must be made in writing at the time of the application to enter the Ph.D. degree program. This request will be granted only if the student has substantially completed the requirements for the Master's degr ee and plans to deposit his/her Master's thesis by April 15. In practical terms, this means that the student should need only to complete fewer than six additional credits, including the Ma ster's Thesis, during the spring se mester before entry into the PhD program.

This course meets for eight 2-hr sessions to explore a variety of ethical and policy issues that may arise in basic and clinical scientific research. The 16-hour course encompasses a series of presentations in different formats that include presentations by guest speak ers, panels of faculty members and videos. Each session also has an hour devoted to small group discussion of specific pre-assigne d case studies with a faculty mentor. These discussions are followed by a fu ll class wrap-up in which the groups compare notes on their conclusions, insigh ts and remaining questions. Each student is required to submit a report discussing the assigned case study each week, a nd at the end of the course is required to submit a real-life case study of an ethical research dilemma enc ountered by the student, and an analysis of the resolution of the dilemma. The main resource is the website created by the Collaborative Institutional Traini ng Initiative (CITI), which invol ves quizzes that the students must pass. This material is supplemented by addi tional assigned reading, with use of selected videos and other special materials. The current c ourse director is Charles Mobbs, PhD, Professor of Neurosciences and Geriatrics. Typical specific topics for the ei ght two hour sess ions are: (i) Research Misconduct; (ii) Experi mental design Mentor We lfare of Laboratory Anim als; (vii) Publication, authorship, and peer review; (viii ) Peer Review, the Grant Proce ss, and Fiduciary Responsibility.

BSR1006 Laboratory Rotation - Fall 4 Credits Director(s): Graduate School Faculty Laboratory rotations are an important part of th e first year of the Graduate Program at Mount Sinai. They give students the opportunity to ex perience different resear ch projects, different laboratory and mentoring styles, an d allow the faculty to assess the interests and aptitude of the students. In general, all PhD a nd MD/PhD students will complete three laboratory rotations (a minimum of two, in two different laboratories, is required) before declarin g a research preceptor and a Multidisciplinary Training Area. The rotatio n facilitates the choice of preceptor and also offers students an exposure to problems and techni ques of interest to them. Grading of rotations will be on a Pass/Fail basis. BSR1010 Biostatistics, Fall 3 Credits Director(s): John Mandeli The purpose of this course is to familiarize stude nts with basic principles of probability and statistics as applied to biomedical research. No prior knowledge of statistics is required. Our goal is to prepare students for critical reading of the scientific literature and for applying basic statistical methods to their own research. The course will be taught using SPSS; the fundamentals of SPSS will be presented. Topics c overed include laws of probability, probability distributions and density functi ons (binomial, normal), the central limit theorem, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, sta tistical power and sample size es timation, t-tests, nonparametric methods, chi-square tests, simple linear regression and on, one-way analysis of variance, two-way analysis of variance, principles of experimental design, completely randomized design, randomized block design, and factorial treatment designs. BSR1012 Biomedical Science - Fall 5 Credits 56 Director(s): Dan Felsenfeld, Matthew O'Connell Biomedical Science is a yearlong, six-unit course that surveys a broad and comprehensive study of basic Molecular, Cellular a nd Developmental Biology. The t opics covered prepare students for both a career in Biomedical Research, and for the Advanced studies within the CAB, DSCB, GGS, IMM, MIC and SMD MTAs. Biomedical Scie nce is a required course for all first year students that intend to be member s of these MTAs. The course is structured as a series of lectures; grade assessment is based on a mixture of in-class and take hom e quizzes as well as one formal examination per unit. BSR1013 Biomedical Science - Spring 5 Credits Director(s): Matthew O'Connell This is the second semester of Biomedical Scie nce, a yearlong, six unit course that surveys a broad and comprehensive study of basic Molecula r, Cellular and Developmental Biology. The topics covered prepare students for both a career in Biomedical Research, and for the Advanced studies within the CAB, DSCB, GGS, IMM, MI C and SMD MTAs. Biomedical Science is a required course for all first year students that intend to be memb ers of these MTAs. The course is structured as a series of lectures; grade asse ssment is based on a mixt ure of in-class and take home quizzes as well as one formal examination per unit. BSR1701 Systems & Organizational Neurobiology, Spring 4 Credits Director(s): Patrick Hof, Elizabeth Cropper Systems Neuroscience is an introductory course de signed to provide a rigo rous survey of brain structure and function encompassing comparativ e and functional neuroanatomy, systems-level neuroscience and physiology, and neuropathology. Th e class is composed of lectures from the medical school's Brain and Behavior course and advanced graduate-level lectures. Periodically, students are given a journal article relevant to the topic of that week in which they will be expected to answer three questions in advance of a student-led di scussion session. Grades will be determined by participation in the discussion an d paper-presentation sess ions and by four, short- answer, non-cumulative quizzes. Our goals and ob jectives are for you to gain a fundamental understanding of systems-leve l neurobiology and neurophysiology while simultaneously gaining an appreciation for how basic neuroscience im pacts our understanding of many clinically relevant aspects of human neuropathology. We feel this will best enab le students to gain comprehensive knowledge of many aspects of human basic and clinical neur oscience, which is a cornerstone of translational issu es relevant to research and pr ogrammatic directions supported by the Department of Neuroscience, Mount Sina i, and the National Institutes of Health. BSR1800 Systems Biomedicine, Spring 6 Credits Director(s): Jeanne Hirsch This active-learning course will introduce co re biochemical, cell biological and molecular mechanisms together with basic bioinformatic an d systems biology concepts and applications in the context of human biomedical research. The emphasis is 'top-down', beginning with a pathophysiological condition studied from a clini cal perspective and moving towards explication of the molecular and metabolic logic, regulator y circuits and cell and tissue specific properties that distinguish the disease and normal state. Th e goals of this course are to provide students with an appreciation of the complexity of biol ogical systems across scales and to give insight into pathophysiology as a basis for scientific enquiry and development of new therapeutic 57 strategies. Students will be guided to relevant textbook material and current reviews, and will also participate in analyses of primary journal articles to enhan ce their study of scientific method and to illustrate a variety of experimental and computational approaches to contemporary translational biomedicine. Problem sets and the methodologies for handling large data sets, including epidemiological and gene tic data, will be introduced. This course is 6 credits with a journal club included in the body of five modules . The first module will be Introduction to Systems Biomedicine and will include an in troduction to modeling using Matlab. The subsequent modules will focus on Diabetes , Cancer, Renal Disease and Drug Abuse. BSR2001 Electron Microscop y, Fall/Spring 2 Credits Director(s): Ronald Gordon This 2 credit didactic course covering the structure and functi on of the electron microscopes, TEM, SEM & STEM; tissue preparation for both types of scopes; freeze fracture; immunocytochemistry at the EM level; imag e analysis; photographic techniques and some special applications to include energy disper sive spectroscopy (EDS), wavelength spectroscopy and a variety of others. BSR2104 Introduction to Computer Modeling & Macromolecules, Spring 3 Credits Director(s): Mihaly Mezei Faculty teaching: and Mihaly Mezei Textbook: A. Leach, Molecular Modeling: Principles and Applications 2nd Ed. The course meets once a week for an hour, but students are expected to work through the tutorials of the various programs involved. During the meeting the concepts behind the computer modeling approaches are discussed, and the pr oblems encountered using the programs are clarified. The course relies mainly on academic software ( VMD from University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign , Amber from Scripps , Gamess from Iowa State University , MMC and Simulaid developed here) as well as on commercial software ( Gaussian and Pymol ). An additional component is the use of Web resources (e.g., the Protein Data Bank or the ZINC library of small molecules). BSR2106 Cellular Physiology & Ion Channels, Spring 2-4 Credits Director(s): Vladimir Brezina This course is designed to introduce gra duate students in physiology and biophysics, neuroscience, cell biology, molecular biology, a nd pharmacology to fundamental concepts of cellular electrophysiology and si gnaling in neurons and other ex citable cells. Understanding signaling on the cellular level is key to understanding how larger ne ural circuits w ithin the brain operate. Furthermore, the specific properties of low-level components such as ion channels are often directly reflected in high- level functions and thei r disorders, and are the targets of drugs that ameliorate these disorders. The course covers the following topics: the laws governing ion movement through solution and membranes; res ting potentials, action potentials, and other electrical membrane potentials; ion permeation through channels; channe l gating; the various types of voltage-gated and ligand-gated channe ls; the roles of ion channels in sensory transduction, synaptic transmission, and learning and memory; channel modulation; and then, as time allows, further topics in cellular signali ng through, for example, intracellular calcium and 58 second messengers. The later parts of the course emphasize the integration of the basic concepts in explaining cellular signali ng on the functional level. De pending on participants' background and interest, some topics may be explored through computational models. The course is structured in two modules. The first provides a general overview of the fundamental concepts. The second offers a more advanced discussion of various instance s of cellular signaling. Most students take both Modules 1 and 2 (4 credits), although it is possi ble to take just Module 1 (2 credits). BSR4102 JC in Biomathematics & Translatio nal Systems Biology Fall/Spring 1 Credit Director(s): Istvan Sugar The goal of this course is to explore a variet y of contemporary topics in mathematical and computational biology by reading and discussing recent journal articles in the field.

Academic Policies and Procedures 6.1 Grading, course examinations, missed examinations Course Directors have the option of giving letter grades A(-), B(+/- ), C(+/ -), and F or grading the course as P/ F, with the exception that all core courses must be gr aded with letter grades. Clinical rotations for MS programs, laboratory rotations and the MTA/departmental seminars and journal clubs are always grad ed as P/F. Elective courses out side of the student's training area may be taken P/F, even if it is a graded co urse. Under extraordinary circumstances (such as medical emergency), a temporary grade of Incomple te (I) may be recorded for a student who is unable to complete course requirements. To receive an incomplete grade, the student mu st make a formal request using the Incomplete Grade Request Form. The form must be signed by both the student and the course director. The request will include the reason for the incomplete , the work yet to be completed, and the final date the work is to be completed. Final approval will be given by the Registrar. Students have one academic year to remediate an incomplete, after which time the incomplete is converted to a failing grade (F). Letter grades (A, B, C, or F) may not be changed once they have been recorded in the Graduate School records, except if there was a cler ical error by the course director in the submission of the grade. If a c ourse director has agreed to consider additional work from a student, then the in itial grade recorded should be an incomplete. This grade must then be resolved within one year of the time of assignment. Students ar e expected to monitor their GPAs and their progress towards comple tion of the General Program Requirements and MTA requirements. Students should be aware that proper citation practices are required on all course take-home exams and papers as well as in proposals, disserta tions and publications. In the event of illness, students should notify the course director(s) on or before the day of the examination (or as soon thereafter as possible) if they are to miss an exam or quiz. Once able, the student should see student health or their docto r and obtain notification of illness. Following that, an exam or quiz will be scheduled at the earliest possible date. In other extenuating circumstances, students shou ld notify the course directors as early as possible if they are to miss an exam or quiz. Pl ans to take an alternative exam or quiz will be considered on an individual basis. If an exam or quiz is missed without illness or extenuating circumstance, a score of zero will be recorded for that paper. A student who has missed an exam should sign a statement certifying that they have not discussed the exam with any ot her class member who may have taken the exam earlier. This form can be obtained from the Graduate School office. 77 Students who have completed all requirements ex cept the dissertation, and have been advanced to doctoral candidacy may register to audit gr aduate courses. Student s receive no credits or grades in such courses. 6.2 Credits/GPA PhD students must complete a mini mum of 72 graduate credits. PhD students must achieve a B (3.0) grade point average in th e core curriculum, which must be completed by the end of the second semester of study. As detail ed later (see Transfer Credits) transfer cr edits are ordinarily awarded for prior graduate work. The averag e time for completion of the PhD program is currently five years and that for the MD/PhD is somewhat less than eight years total. In calculating the GPA, all credits with the follo wing grades are counted in the total used to compute the grade point average/cumulative i ndex: A (+/-), B (+/-), C (+/-), and F. To compute the grade point average, follow the steps below: Determine the total number of credits completed by adding up all the credits with letter grades. This total must include any credits with \"F\" grades. For each course with a letter grade, which c ounts toward the GPA, multiply the number of credits by the appropriate quality poi nt value, as indicated below: Grade Quality Point Value A 4.00 A- 3.70 B+ 3.30 B 3.00 B- 2.70 C+ 2.30 C 2.00 C- 1.70 F 0.00 Add the quality point values for all the course s to determine the total quality points. Divide the total quality points by the total number of credits (as computed in Step 1). The resulting figure is the grade point average/ cumulative index. Please note that the index is computed to two decimal points a nd the index is not rounded off. Credits with grades of P or SP do not figure into the computation of the grade point average but 78 do count toward the degree. Transf er credits also count toward the degree but do not figure into the index. Credits for undergraduate courses ne ither count toward th e degree nor are they computed into the average. 6.3 Graduate School Grade Appeals Process A student has 3 months from the date of receiving a course grade to make an appeal. The student must realize that the grade may be amended in eith er direction. All course grade appeals must be brought by the student to the course director. If there is still a discrepanc y after the meeting of the course director and the st udent, the student should present the problem in writing to the Program Director, or Associate Dean of the Gra duate School, who will ensure that due diligence was done by the course director a nd that, in fact, no error had been made. If the student wishes to pursue an appeal, either the Program Director, or the Associat e Dean of the Graduate School, will establish an ad hoc committee to address th e appeal. Information for the appeal should be solicited from both the student and the course dir ector. In some cases, at the discretion of the Chair of the Appeal Committee, (who must be some one other than the course director) it may be appropriate to hold a meeting during which the st udent must state the appeal to the Committee. The Committee will commence a thorough investigati on within 30 days of receipt of the appeal. The Committee must complete the investig ation and submit its report within 120 days. Deliberation of the committee should address the student's appeal question. The decision of the committee will be final. 6.4 Transfer Credits and Course Exemptions/Waivers Transfer credits Credits for graduate courses take n at other institutions may be awarded under certain conditions and must be approved by the Program Director and the Dean of the Graduate School. Program Directors reserve the right to establish degree requirements for all students in their programs. Therefore, students with prior graduate course work are not necessarily exempt from all requirements demanded of Mount Sinai degree candidates. The courses for transfer credit must be consid ered appropriate to the degree sought and have been completed with a grade of B or better at an institution of established academic reputation. Courses taken on a pass/fail basis may be used fo r transfer credit; provid ed the student provides proof (a letter from the course director or prev ious Program Director) that a grade of B or better would have been given. Courses for which a master's degree has been awarded may not be transferred to a Mount Sinai master's degree. The number of credits transferred shall be no more than the number of credits given by that institution for the courses. Decisions regard ing transfer credits are not made prior to matriculation. All transfer credits will be assi gned a grade of P. Acad emic credit for courses taken prior to admission to a degree program may be granted for a maximum of 16 credits toward a master's and 40 credits toward the PhD degree. 79 The application for academic credit for work done elsewhere must contain a list of the courses, with grades, for which the student is seeking credit, and must be approved by the Program Director and the Dean of the Graduate School. In order for credit to be granted, official transcripts showing the courses for which credit is sought must be submitted to the Registrar for approval, unless they are alrea dy on file in the student's Gra duate School academic folder. Transfer credits do not show on th e student's transcript until the requirements for the degree are completed. Programs that require tuition payment on a per credit basis may decrease the number of tuition- bearing credits by the number of transfer credits. Course Waivers/Exemptions On occasion a course waiver may be granted by a particular program even without coursework that will justify granting of credit. A petition for such consideration should be made by the student to the course and/or Program Director and the merit of the petition will then be considered. Upon recommendation by both the Program and course directors, the final granting of the waiver will be made by the Graduate School Dean. Requests for waivers of any course, including Program requirements, must be made in writing within the first weeks of the semester, before the add/drop deadline. Students seeking exemption from certain courses, based on prior course work, must meet with the course director to discuss the content of the prior course. Exemption from certain courses may require an exemption exam or other assessment. The course director will inform the Graduate School office whether or not the student is exempt from the course in question. The course will appear on the student 's transcript as \"EX\". Student s who are exempt from a course may count course credits associated with the exempted course toward s the credits for the degree. 6.5 Guidelines for Registration/Cross-Registration Students conduct their research and take their courses at th e Mount Sinai campus. Courses offered in all programs for the academic year are published in two announcements (Fall and Spring) and are available on the Gr aduate School web page. It is important that students consult their advisors and MTA Director s to plan their programs. All incoming students will receive their registrati on materials when they arrive for orientation week before fall classes. Ongoing students can access the Graduate School's student portal for registration information and should meet with thei r advisors with respect to timely completion of requirements and courses covering their specific training needs. Students who have completed all course requirements and have not reached 72 cred its should register for Independent Research. This is an appropriate course only for advanced students who have already chosen a preceptor. Once all MTA course requirements have been me t and the student has successfully completed the first two of the three-part Preliminary, s/he will be Advanced to Candidacy. After that, no courses should be taken for graded credits, and the student registers each semester for Doctoral Dissertation Research. Although the student does not register for a seminar and journal club, s/he 80 must participate in a seminar and journal club each semester. Students are required to fill out on-line cour se evaluations for each course taken. These evaluations provide valuable f eedback to the Course Directors and the Curriculum Committee and are used to improve course offerings. Evalua tions must be completed within 4 weeks of the end of a course. If such evaluations are not completed in a timely manner, students will receive an \"Incomplete\" on their transcript and may be placed on \"academic hold\" by the Registrar. All registration should be completed in a timel y manner, on or before the set deadline. A $100 late fee will be charged to the student for failu re to submit the registration materials on time. Students who do not register by the final late re gistration deadline will be administratively withdrawn from the Program. These students can petition for readmission by submitting an Application for Readmission, with th e requisite re-application fee. The add/drop period lasts 2 weeks. Students who withdraw from a course during this period will not have the course appear on thei r transcript. Students may withdr aw from a course at any time up to 24 hours before the end of the course, but if withdrawal occurs af ter the add/drop period, the course will be listed on the st udent's transcript with a \"W\". Students who do not meet the requirements of th e New York State Immuni zation Law will not be permitted to register. The Student Health Servic es Office is required by New York State Law to maintain up-to-date records for each student, in cluding the Periodic Health Evaluation and an annual PPD. Students who do not comply will not be permitted to register. It is the responsibility of the student to make sure that his/her file is complete. Upon reque st, the Graduate School Office can inform the student if any documen ts are missing. Students are not permitted to register for courses after the add/ drop deadline. If a student is not registered for a given semester, s/he will be administratively withdrawn from the Program and will not be permitted to register for the subsequent semester. That student will have to petition to be readmitted to the Program. Therefore, each student should be sure that s/he is registered for every semester until s/he has deposited the Dissertation. PhD and MD/PhD students may register for course s in other graduate programs at Mount Sinai (e.g. MD, MPH, MS in Clinical Research, etc.) w ith the permission of their dissertation advisor, their Program Director, the course director, and the Dean of the Graduate School. The Graduate School will pay the tuition for one single-semester course per year during the research years. Payment of tuition for additional courses will be the responsibility of the student or their dissertation advisor. In some instances, a student may wish to take a course that is not avai lable at Mount Sinai. Students must receive permission from their disse rtation advisor, their MTA Director, and the relevant course director. Payment of tuition for such courses will be the responsibility of the student or their dissertation advisor. Courses taken at another institution will appear on the student's transcript as long as the studen t follows the proper registration procedure. 81 6.6 Auditing Courses A full-time matriculated student may audit a course with the permission of the course director. Students auditing a course do not write examinations or papers and do not necessarily participate in class discussion sections. However, auditors should clarify expectations at the start of the course with the course director and may be required to fully part icipate in the class. Permission to audit a course must be obtained from the c ourse director prior to the end of the add/drop period. An audited course will appear on the student's transcri pt with the designation \"AU\". Credits for a course being audited will not be counted for determining full-time status (international students) or financial aid status. Non-matriculated students, including employees , who wish to audit a course and have the audited course appear on a transcript as \"AU\" will be billed at the same rate as for courses taken for credit. A completed Course Audit Form, with all required signatures, must be submitted to the Registrar. Unofficial courtesy auditing is permitted with the permission of the course director. No tuition will be ch arged and a transcript will not be provided for unofficial auditing. 6.7 Retaking Courses Students seeking to improve their grade point average (GPA) may retake a course, with permission of the Dean of the Graduate School or the Program Director. If a course is retaken, the original grade remains on the transcript but on ly the second (retake) grade will be counted in the determination of the student's GPA, even if that grade is lower than the grade previously earned. A student who has earned credit for a cour se may repeat it once, but will not receive additional credit. Students cannot receive financial aid to cover the tuition for retaking a course. 6.8 Satisfactory Progress It is crucial that students, Advisory Committees , and/or Program Director s monitor the students' progress throughout the duration of their academic training. Con tinued financial support is contingent upon maintaining satisfactory progress at all times. Additiona lly, failure to achieve and maintain satisfactory progress, after couns eling is sought from the Advisory Committee and/or Dean of the Graduate School, can result in academic probation and ultimately, dismissal from the Program. Under exceptional circumstances, th e dissertation advisor, with the support of the student's Advisory Committee, may petition the Dean in writing to let a st udent continue his/her studies beyond the 7-year time limit for PhD students or 6 y ears in the PhD phase for MD/PhD students. There is no guarantee that full s tipend support will continue under these circumstances and each case will be renewed by the Dean and must be appr oved by the Dean. Satisfactory progress is maintained in the following ways for PhD students: 82 by matriculation on a full-time basis for first year students, by demonstration of potential for research and of timely progress toward the choice of diss ertation advisor and Training Area through their rotation activities by timely submission of a completed Labor atory Rotation Agreement Form and a completed Laboratory Rotation Evaluation Form for each rotation (see section on Laboratory Rotation) by achievement of the 3.0 GPA in the Co re Curriculum (see details under General Program Requirements) by completion successfully of 1st part of th e Preliminary examination by the end of the first year in the Program by completion of at least 14 lette r-graded credits of coursework by having no more than two incomplete grad es, unless they resulted from an approved leave of absence which occurred before a final grade could be assigned by successfully reaching and passing each of th e Program Progress

project goals following the selection of a dissertation advisor by completion of at least 72 gradua te credits for the PhD degree by completion of all requirements for the PhD degree, including defense and deposit of the Dissertation, within the tim e limits of the Program, i.e., (defend and deposit by June 30 of the seventh year in the Program) by developing a research project, under the su pervision of one or more faculty members, which results in a thesis that reports th e new findings, and is presented, defended and deposited Satisfactory progress is maintained in the following ways for MD/PhD students: 83 by matriculation on a full-time basis for first and second year stude nts, by developing an approve d rotation program in which progress is made towards the selection of a dissertation advisor and Training Area by the mid second year by submission of a completed Laboratory Rotation Agreement Form and a completed Laboratory Rotation Evaluation Form for each rotation by completion of USMLE Step I at the end of the second MD year and USMLE Step II at the end of the third MD year (or making sp ecific, approved plans for different timing) by achievement of the 3.0 GPA in the PhD Core Curriculum (see details under General Program Requirements) by completion of the General Program Require ments for the PhD by the end of the first year in the Program by achievement and maintenance of an overall GP A of 3.0 by the end of the first year in the Program by completion of at least 14 lette r-graded credits of coursework by having no more than two incomplete grad es, unless they resulted from an approved leave of absence which occurred before a final grade could be assigned by successfully reaching and passing each of th e Program Progress Points by the required deadlines (see details in section on Progress Points) by meeting with the FULL Advisory Committee at least once a year and submission of a Progress Form following each meeting by meeting with the MD/PhD Associate Director at leas t twice each year by meeting monthly with the clini cal advisors during the PhD phase by active participation in j ournal clubs and seminars by demonstration of the

progress is maintained in the fo llowing ways for MS in Biomedical Sciences: by matriculation on a full-time basis by achievement of the 3.0 GPA in the Co re Curriculum (see details under General Program Requirements) by completion of at least 14 lette r-graded credits of coursework by demonstration of the ability to grow in re search skills and movement towards project goals following the selection of a dissertation advisor by completion of at least 45 graduate credits for the Masters in Biomedical Sciences by developing a research project, under the su pervision of one or more faculty members, which results in a thesis that reports th e new findings, and is presented, defended and deposited Satisfactory progress is maintained in the fo llowing ways for MS in Genetic Counseling: by matriculation on a full-time basis by achievement and maintenance of an overall GPA of 3.0 by the end of the first year by completion of at least 30 letter graded credits of coursework having no more than two incomplete grades, unl ess they resulted from an approved leave of absence which occurred before a final grade could be assigned by meeting with the Program Dir ector at least twice each year

by completion at least 50 distinct, supervised face-to-face genetic counseling cases as defined by the American Board of Genetic Counseling by completion of all requirements for the Mast er of Science degree including presentation and deposit of the clinical res earch project (thesis) within the parameters of the Program If the dissertation advisor is dissatisfied w ith the academic progress of a student and is considering removing the student from the labor atory the following steps must be taken: Document sources of dissatisfaction. 1. The advisor will have direct discussions with the student to clarify the issues and to set a plan to correct the proble ms. A summary of the discus sions should be documented. 2. If dissatisfaction continues, mediation between the student a nd advisor should be sought by meeting with the MTA Director and the student's Advisory Committee. 3. If required, a discussion between the student , the advisor, and the Dean or Associate Dean should be also sought to determine wh ether the issues are pot entially irrevocable. 4. The Dean may place the student on probati on for a period not exceeding a semester. If the student is placed on probation and fails to achieve sufficient academic progress during the following semester, the Promotion Committee will review the Student's status and may recommend dismissal from the Ph.D. program . 6.9 Suspension and Dismissal The Dean of the Graduate School can administratively suspend a student pending committee review or may administratively dismiss a student. Suspensions will generally be imposed for students who exhibit the following: positive to xicology result, disruptive behavior, illegal behavior, egregious misconduct, or failure to meet administrative re sponsibilities (including financial obligations). Dismissal at the discretion of the Dean of the Graduate School may result when a student is convicted of a misdemeanor or felony, exhibits a serious breach of academic or professional misconduct (including ch eating) or after a series of warning following suspension. Any student who fails to comply with going for a requested administrative evaluation or fails to fulfill the requirements that stems from this ev aluation will be dismissed from the Graduate School. 86 6.10 Committee on Promotions Students in the graduate program s at Mount Sinai School of Medicine have been carefully selected for the demands of gra duate study. It is understandable that some students, no matter how qualified, may have difficulty in meeting th e graduate program's requirements, such as satisfactory completion of courses and other requirements within a given timeframe and maintaining standards of prof essional conduct at all times. The Committee on Promotions will meet at the end of each academic year to review the records and progress of all first-year PhD students. Additional meetings of the Committee may be called by the Dean of the Graduate School when either the Dean, MTA Director s or Graduate Program Directors request that the Committee meet to re view a particular student or students. The Committee will make recommendations to the Dean of the Graduate School with regard to promotion, non-promotion, or dismissal from the school for academic or other reasons. The Committee on Promotions will consist of a chairperson appointed by the Dean, one of the Co-Directors of each MTA, and the Program Dir ector, or their designate, of the graduate program in which the stude nt(s) is matriculated. The Dean's decision will be rendered verbally to the student by the Dean or Program Director and will be confirmed in writing to the studen t. Appeals of decisions of the Committee on Promotions can be made only to the Dean of the Graduate School within two weeks of the Committee's decision. The two-week deadline will be gin as soon as the student has received the verbal decision. 6.11 Appeals Process Students who have been placed on probationary stat us or asked to leave the Program because of lack of Satisfactory Progress ma y appeal these actions by petiti oning the Dean of the Graduate School to have an Academic Appeals Committ ee meeting convened. The student will have the opportunity to present to that Co mmittee. If a student has alrea dy identified a thesis advisor, he/she will also be able to speak with the Committee at that time. The Academic Appeals Committee will make a recommendation to the D ean of the Graduate School. Once a student decides to come before the Academic Appeals Co mmittee, rather than vol untarily withdraw from the Program, s/he relinquishes the right to withdr aw from Mount Sinai School of Medicine. If the Academic Appeals Committee recommends dismissal, the student's transcript will so indicate. A student in the first year who does not successf ully complete the Core Curriculum will be permitted to maintain student status during the ap peals process or until June 30 of that school year, whichever comes first. 6.12 Vacation Policy In general, the Graduate School anticipates that students will take two weeks of vacation each year, exclusive of travel to scientific meeti ngs and days explicitly taken off for study and 87 preparation for examinations. Individual circumst ances may cause a specific student mentor pair to agree to an individual vacation plan that s eems appropriate given the nature of the student's efforts over a period of time, particular family ci rcumstances, parental leave, etc. Students must be sensitive, however, to their ob ligation to inform the thesis a dvisor (or the rotation advisor of all proposed and planned absences so that the flow of experimental work can similarly be planned and discussed). In the event of an unanticipated absence, students should make ev ery effort to communicate with the laboratory and the Graduate School Dean as soon as possibl e. Any unexplained absence will constitute lack of satisfactor y progress in the Program and can result in academic probation, administrative leave of absence, and ultimately, dismissal from the Program. 6.13 Leave of Absence & Withdrawal A student who wishes to interrupt his/her graduate studies for not more than one academic year due to serious illness or compelling personal reasons , may request a leave of absence. If the leave is approved by the Dean of the Graduate School the student will be reassured of readmission at the end of the approved leave. Such approval can only be obtained if the student maintains satisfactory progress (as defined earlier) and has the approval of the thesis advisor, his/her Advisory Committee and the Multidisciplinary Training Area Directorship. Students, who fail to follow any conditions of th e approval, will be administratively withdrawn from the Program. If the student wishes to return at a later date, s/he must apply for readmission. Students on a leave of absence are not eligible fo r any benefits associated with maintenance of student status, including the stip end, tuition, health insurance and travel award for the duration of the leave. Students on a medi cal leave of absence may re quest continuation of housing privileges. Students on a personal leave of abse nce may request student-housing privilege based on availability. For financial aid purposes (loans), a student may be out of school on an approved leave of absence for up to 180 days with no repayment cons equences. After 180 days, the last date that the student was matriculated as a full-time student will be reported to the lender as the \"out of school\" date. A student will then go into repayment status immedi ately. Once the student returns to full-time matriculated status, the loans coul d then be deferred. However, there would no longer be a 180 days grace period once the student graduates, or leaves school for any other reason, including withdrawal or anot her approved leave of absence. Students must submit a Leave of Absence Request Form (available in the Graduate School Office) with a letter stating the re asons for the leave, if he/she is requesting a pers onal leave or if the request is for medical reas ons, a doctor's letter should acc ompany the form. International students can only request a leave of absence for medical reasons because of visa requirements and should consult with Mount Sinai's Interna tional Office personnel to discuss about their status while on leave. Students should notify th e Office of Student Serv ices and the Registrar when they return from a leave of absence. If the leave of absence is for medical reasons, a doctor's letter should conf irm that the student is eligible to return. 88 NB The period of an authorized leave is forma lly included in the Program time limit. A student who was on an approved leave of absence may petit ion the Dean of the Graduate School for an extension of the Program time limit, encompassing the time period of the leave of absence. This petition must have the support of the student 's thesis advisor, Advisory Committee and Multidisciplinary Training Area Directorship. Such requests will be considered under circumstances that merit such special consideration. Requests for an extension of a leave of absen ce must follow the same procedure as indicated above. Request for voluntary withdrawal from th e Program must be made by submission of the Request for Withdrawal Form , with all required signatures. To resume doctoral study a former student must apply for readmission. 6.14 Parental Leave A student anticipating the need fo r parental leave should discuss th is with their thesis advisor well in advance (about 4-5 months) of the anticipated leave. Pare ntal leave must be approved by the program director and the Dean of the Gradua te School. During the period of parental leave, completion of academic assignments (exams, written assignments, and any other academic requirements) and academic progress milest ones may be postponed for up to 12 weeks. Recognizing that mothers-to-be ma y need time before a child is born as well as time to recover from the birth and to care for their new babies, female graduate students will be allowed 8 weeks paid maternity leave to be taken in any combinati on of pre-natal and post-natal time. During this leave, full-time student status will be maintained , i.e. health and housing benefits will continue and visa status will remain unchanged. If a stude nt chooses to continue a leave beyond 8 weeks, she is entitled to up to 12 w eeks under the Family and Medical Leave Act. These additional 4 weeks will be taken from vacation time, followed by unpaid leave. During the unpaid leave, all benefits (health, housing) will be suspended. Inte rnational students should be aware that their student status might be comp romised by unpaid leave. In the event that medical complications require more than an 8-week leave, students will be covered by the medical leave pol icy of the Graduate School. Students on training grants or in dividual fellowships must abid e by the leave policies of the institutional NRSA or individual fellowship. In the event that the amount of leave allowed by an external funding agency is less than what the Graduate School allows, the Graduate School will pay the stipend and health benefits of the st udent for the time not c overed by the grant or fellowship, such that the student will receive the equivalent of 8 weeks paid leave. Students who adopt a child will be entitled to th e same 8-week maternity leave already described for the birth of a child, to be taken in any combination of pre and post adoption time. Fathers, or partners in a legal domestic partne rship, will be allowed 2 weeks of paid parental leave for either childbirth or adoption. The leave can be taken as needed either before or after the 89 arrival of the child. If a graduate student receives a stipend from a disserta tion advisor's grant, and if continuing the stipend for the period of the parent al leave constitutes a hardship for the dissertation advisor, the dissertation advisor should disc uss the possible limitations of continuing the student's support during the period of the parental leave with th e Dean of the Graduate School. The Graduate program in which the student is enrolled should be sensitive to such situations and negotiate with the dissertation advisor a suitable strategy fo r continuing stipend support of the student. 6.15 Full-time Equivalency Status Graduate students in the basic science graduate programs who are registered for less than 9 credits may, in certain situations , be granted \"full-time equivalenc y\" by the Dean of the Graduate School. Typically, full-time equivalency is gr anted if one of the following applies: You are taking 7-8 credits of coursework, and working as a teaching or research assistant for your program You are completing or have fulfilled all coursework requirements and are working full- time on thesis or dissertation research Students who are granted full-time equivalency w ill be designated as \"full-time\" or \"fully- matriculated\" by the Registrar. Foreign graduate students who enroll in less than 9 credits and who are not eligible for full-time equivalency will be put on hold pending a deci sion by the Office of International Personnel regarding their visa status. This needs to be determined by the end of the second week of the term or their F-1 visa status will be in jeopardy. 6.16 Special Matriculation Stat us for Graduate Students There are instances when a student will no long er be eligible to receive a stipend from either his/her dissertation advisor or the Gra duate School. Provided he/she is in good academic standing and continues to pay the $100 maintenance of ma triculation fee, the student is entitled to retain e-mail and library privileges, purchase hi s/her own health insuran ce at his/her own cost through MSSM until he/she deposits his/her thesis. 6.17 Non-Matriculated Students Non-matriculated students may register for cour ses in the Graduate Sc hool by filling out an application to the Graduate School as a non-matr iculated student and paying the $80 application fee. The Course Permission Form for Non-Matriculated Students must be filled out and submitted to the Registrar after obtaining all the required signatures. Permission of the Course Director must be obtained in advance of filli ng out the form. Students will be billed for the appropriate amount of tuiti on and will be entitled to receive a transcript. 90 Non-matriculated students may obtain credit for research don e at Mount Sinai School of Medicine under the supervision of a member of the Graduate Faculty. The faculty mentor will determine the grade (P/F). The st udent must provide a description of the research project and the anticipated amount of time (hours/week per seme ster) s/he intends to spend performing the research. The Graduate School will review the proposal and determine the maximum number of credits to be allocated. The student will pay the appropriate amount of tuition ($850.00/credit for the 2012-'13 academic year) and will be entitled to receive an official transcript documenting the number of credits received and the grade (P/F). 6.18 Visiting Scholars Students who are pursuing a graduate degree at another institution and have been invited by a MSSM department or laboratory/ center to do research in thei r field of study may apply for Visiting Scholar status. International Visiting Sc holars must contact the Office for International Personnel to discuss visa and reporting requirements. Registration: A Visiting Scholar must fill out an application, available in the Admissions Office. This category is distinct fr om a non-matriculated student. Duration of stay: Visiting Scholars will be admitted for the period of time specified in the initial invitation letter. A Visiting Sc holar who wishes to continue beyond the period initially agreed upon has to submit a letter of approval from the home institution and a letter from the host department or laboratory/cente r requesting the extension. Health insurance: A Visiting Scholar must prov ide proof of basic health insurance coverage. International students must have insurance th at meets all the requirements specified by the federal regulations for J-1 students. Financial aid: A Visiting Sc holar is not eligible for fina ncial aid services from MSSM. Employment: A Visiting Scholar may receive comp ensation for work done for the host research group. In compliance with federal regulations, international visiti ng students are not allowed to have any other employment, either on-campus or off campus. Students on a visa must discuss employment regulations with the Office of Interna tional Personnel. Housing: Mount Sinai does not guarantee housi ng for Visiting Scholars and their requests are determined based on availability. Visiting Scholars are expected to follow the sa me guidelines required for incoming students. Visiting Scholars must (i) complete a physical examination with their own doctor or at Student Health Services; (i i) take the toxicology-screening test; and (iii) take the HIPAA test. All Visiting Scholars will be subjec t to a criminal background check. 91 7. Registrar's Office The Mount Sinai School of Medicine Regist rar's Office supports teaching and learning by maintaining the integrity of academic policies and the student information system. The Registrar's Office is the steward of MSSM's student records from application to degree conferral in perpetuity. The Registrar's key functions in carrying out this mi ssion focus on guarding the integrity and security of all student records in accordance with ethical and legal standards, maintaining accurate and timely records of academ ic progress in order to provide definitive student status, and providing students with enro llment services necessary to pursue their educational goals. To that end, below please find information pert aining to the policies and procedures under the purview of the Registrar's Office. For addi tional information about services and academic policies, please contact the Regist rar Staff, 13-30 Annenberg, 212-241-6691 7.1 Academic Standing Students may be terminated from a degree progr am at any time if, in the judgment of the Graduate School or the Medical Sc hool, a student fails to make satisfactory progress towards the completion of the degree (regardless of grades). Status of probation, suspension, and dismissal are accurately and perm anently reflected on a student's transcript. Good Standing A student will be considered in good standing if they are making academic progress in their grades, meeting the academic expectations of their degree program, and remain free of academic or administrative \"holds.\" Probation Students in poor academic standing may be pl aced on probation by the Dean for Medical Education or the Dean for the Graduate Sc hool, or their appointe d representatives: Academic/Student Affairs Associate Deans in each school, the Promotions Committees, or Graduate School Program Directors. Once a st udent is placed on academic probation, scholarly progress must be made within a specific time period. Academic expulsion is the likely consequence if performance continues to be uns atisfactory. Students on probation are considered enrolled. Suspension Academic suspension may occur when the school withdraws the student for failing to maintain satisfactory academic progress or to meet standa rd educational goals of the degree program. Students who are suspended from the School are required to spend a defined period of time, away from the School. During this period, the stude nt may be required to successfully complete activities defined by the School's Dean, Promotions Committee, or Program Di rector (in lieu of a 92 Promotions Committee) if they are to be considered for read mission to Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Students on suspension are not considered enrolled. See specific sections related to Disciplinary processes in each spec ific program's section of the handbook. 7.2 Withdrawal and Readmission Clearance Clearance to withdraw is requi red. Students must complete th e appropriate paperwork found in the Registrar's Office. Voluntary Withdrawal A student may voluntarily withdr aw from school at any time, upon application to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs (MD students) or the Associate Dean of the Graduate School (PhD, Master's students). A student who voluntarily withdraws may apply for readmission at a later time. Future reinstatement may be denied either at the time of the withdrawal or at the time of application for reinstatement for reasons deemed sufficient to the Admissions Committee. The Office for Student Affairs may require an Admi nistrative Evaluation pr ior to acceptance of a withdrawal. Failure to comply would result in dismissal. For further information on withdrawing for a specific program, refer to section 6.13 of this handbook. Administrative Withdrawal In certain circumstances, a student may be administratively withdrawn from the school. Examples would include a student who has exceede d two years on medical or personal leave or a student who fails to meet the technical standard s required for medical education. A student who chooses to withdraw rather than be dismisse d, either on appeal from a committee decision or after failing Step I and Step II three times will be considered to have administratively withdrawn. Readmission At least three months prior to the requested date, students se eking readmission into the School of Medicine must submit paperwork to the Associate Dean of Admissions. Petition for readmission can be found in the Registrar's Office. Holds The Mount Sinai School of Medici ne utilizes a system of holds when students fail to meet standard educational obligations. A \"hold\" pr events the release of a student's academic transcript and freezes a student's registration status so that they may not continue on to the next term until the hold is appropriately addressed by th e student. All financial obligations must be satisfied before a student can register for another term and continue their st udies and/or research. Students with holds will not be eligible for fi nancial aid refunds until the hold is appropriately addressed by the student. Types of MSSM Holds: Academic, Administrati ve, Health, Housing, Fina ncial and Registrar. 93 7.3 Transcripts Official copies of your Mount Si nai transcript can be requested when a stamped and sealed copy of your academic record is required. Requests for o fficial transcripts require the signature of the student/alumnus reques ting the transcript. Document request forms can be found at: http://www.mssm.edu/education/student-res ources/registrar/gra duate-school-forms Transcripts and/or the MSPE ca nnot be sent out for students who are not in \"good standing\". This includes but is not limited to academic, fina ncial, housing, library, and health holds. To be considered \"official\" a transcript must: Bear the Registrar's signature. Be stamped with the Seal of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Be sent directly from the Registrar's Of fice to a designated person or institution. Be on official tran script paper. Students may request an unofficial copy of their tran script for their personal records. This will be stamped \"Student Copy\" and may not be used for official purposes. Credentials All offers of admission are provisional, pending r eceipt and evaluation of final transcripts. Transcripts must be sent directly from the a ppropriate Registrar's Office to the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Registrar's Office. These an d all other materials requested by the Registrar in conjunction with the admissions process mu st be received to complete a student's enrollment. Submission of false or misleading in formation in the application materials or in connection with the application process will be considered by the Admissions Committee and/or the Student Promotions Committee as grounds for withdrawal of the acceptance offer, dismissal, or rescission of degree. 94 8. Tuition and Financial Aid 8.1 Tuition Payment may be made by personal check, bank draf t, or money order, drawn to the order of Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Tu ition and fees may be paid in installments the first day of each term. For payment plan and/or credit card payment arrangements, please contact Tuition Management Systems, an independent compa ny, at (800) 722-4867. The Board of Trustees reserves the right to revise all fees, including tuition. All financial obligations must be cleared prior to completion of each academic year. Students who have not cleared their account will not be allowe d to re-register, receive a transcript or letter of recommendation, have academic credits certifie d, receive a leave of ab sence, receive other student services, attend class/clerkship for the curr ent academic term, or ha ve a degree conferred. There is an interest charge of one percent pe r month (1 percent/month) on balances not covered by financial aid and/or tuition payment plan. At the end of the academic year, unpaid balances will be turned over to an outside collection agency. 8.2 Tuition Refund Policy Students who withdraw from the institution during an academic term will receive a tuition refund based on the below institutional schedule. Tuitio n refunds will be calculated based on the date the student submits their withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office. Withdrawal through the first calendar week of the term 100% of Tuition Only Second calendar week of classes 75% of Tuition Only Third calendar week of classes 50% of Tuition Only Fourth calendar week of classe s 25% of Tuition Only After the Fourth week of classes NO REFUND Students whose tuition is charge d per credit hour and who choos e to drop course(s) past the approved drop/add period, will be refunded based on the above schedule. Students should note that dropping classes might cause a status change from full-ti me to part-time. Changing the status or the number of credit hours in a program may have signi ficant academic and/or financial consequences. Consider consul ting the Office of Financial Serv ices and your advisor before making any changes to your schedule. For students receiving federal financial aid pro cessed through the Office of Financial Services, be advised that all funds from federal Title IV programs will be returned to the government according to federal regulations. No refunds will be granted to students dismissed or suspended. The institution reserves the right to dismiss a student whose academic standing or general conduct is considered unsatisfactory. 95 8.3 Financial Aid General Policy Mount Sinai School of Medicine consistently provides as much financial assistance as possible to all students who are in good academic standing, maintain satisfactory academic progress, meet filing deadlines and require financ ial assistance in order to atte nd the School. Admission to the School of Medicine is completely independent of financial requir ements. Financial aid decisions are made on the basis of documented need withou t discrimination due to race, sex, color, creed, age, national origin, disability, military stat us, marital status, religion, genetic disposition, citizenship, or sexual orientation. Applications Master's degree students w ho are interested in applyi ng only for Federal Stafford Subsidized/Unsubsidized loans (up to annua l totals of $8,500/$12,000) can supply FAFSA data on the Web at http://www.fafsa.ed.gov. Reapplication is required annually for all loan and scholarship recipients. Exit Interviews Students who have been issued loans from MSSM controlled funds (Perkins, Sinai Endowments, etc.) and recipients of Stafford Loans and other federal loans will meet with a representative of the Office of Student Financial Services prio r to graduation or separation. Loans will be summarized; terms of repayment, defermen t and responsibility will be discussed. 8.4 Debt Management and Counseling Throughout the student's education the Office of Student Financial Services is available to discuss indebtedness, career choi ces, and money management issu es. Graduating students should be aware of the requirements of the various ex ternal student loan programs in which they may have participated. It is importa nt to maintain contact with M ount Sinai School of Medicine and the appropriate lending institutions, to understand th e terms of each loan program, and to plan for repayment. Timely loan repayments are essent ial in establishing a good credit rating. The extent that loan indebtedness will impact on future expe nse budgeting can be considerable. In order to assist student in tracking loans, interest rates and various conditi ons of the loans, the Office of Student Financial Services suggests that one of the Web sites below be consulted for debt- management information and encourages students to avail themselves of these tools. The methodology converts cumulative educational debt s into estimates of approximate periodic repayments over a ten-year period. https://www.aamc.org/ http://www.accessloans.org 96 8.5 Length of Time to Complete Degree A student will be permitted a maximum time limit to complete a degree: Degree Normal Limit (Yea rs) Maximum Limit (Years) M.D. 4 6 M.D. / Ph.D. 8 10 Ph.D. (Biological Sciences) 5 7 M.S. Genetic Counseling 1.5 2 MS Biomedical Sciences 1.5-2 3 These limits are applied incremen tally, e.g., by the end of the thir d year of enrollment in the M.D. program a student must have completed and satisfactorily pass ed at least two full years of the curriculum. These time limits include any time for personal or medical leave of absence, but do not include approved periods of Special Ma triculation for resear ch or remediation. In the Ph.D., M.D./Ph.D., and M.S. programs, be nchmarks of satisfactory progress must be completed as outlined in the specific program requirements. Students who are approaching the time limit for completion will be revi ewed with enough notice so that a plan is in place to enable the student to complete the requirements by the end of the time limit. 8.6 Completion of Course Requirements A student must complete with passing grades at least 75 percent of the full-time curriculum for which s/he was enrolled in any academic year. A st udent who does not meet this standard will be placed on financial aid probation for one term. If the standards are not met at the end of that term, suspension of all aid is in effect until the standards are met. 97 9. Responsible Conduct in Research General Statement Students are expected to maintain the high standards of ethical and personal conduct that are the prerequisite for a productive rese arch environment. Students ar e required to participate in special seminars about the ethical issues and dilemmas that arise in research environments, and are encouraged to seek guidance with respect to optimal forms of record-keeping. Thesis advisors should familiarize their st udents with expected practices. Academic Integrity Failure to adhere to Mount Sinai's standards of academic integrity will be treated as serious offenses that are inconsistent with the goals and activities of the academic environment. Some basic types of behavior that are unacceptable include, but are not limited to, the following examples: 1. Cheating: using unauthorized notes, study aids, or information on an examination; altering a graded work after it has been returned, then submitting the work for re-grading; allowing another person to do one's work and submitting that wo rk under one's own name; submitting identical or similar papers for credit in more than one cour se without prior permi ssion from the course instructors. 2. Plagiarism: submitting material that in part or whole is not entirely one's own work without attributing those same porti ons to their correct source. 3. Fabrication: falsifying or inven ting any information, data or cita tion; presenting data that were not gathered in accordance with standard guidelines defining the appropriate methods for collecting or generating data and failing to incl ude an accurate account of the method by which the data were gathered or collected. 4. Obtaining an Unfair Advantage: (a) steali ng, reproducing, circulating or otherwise gaining access to examination materials prior to the tim e authorized by the instructor; (b) stealing, destroying, defacing or concealing li brary materials with the purpose of depriving others of their use; (c) unauthorized collaborating on an academ ic assignment (d) retaining, possessing, using or circulating previously given examination material s, where those materials clearly indicate that they are to be returned to the instructor at th e conclusion of the examin ation; (e) intentionally obstructing or interfering with another student 's academic work, or (f) otherwise undertaking activity with the purpose of cr eating or obtaining an unfair ac ademic advantage over other students' academic work. 5. Aiding and Abetting Academic Dishonesty: (a ) providing material, information, or other assistance to another person with kn owledge that such aid could be used in any of the violations stated above, or (b) providing false informati on in connection with any inquiry regarding academic integrity. 6. Falsification of Records and Official Docu ments: altering documen ts affecting academic records; forging signatures of authorization or falsifying information on an official academic 98 document, grade report, letter of permission, pe tition, drop/add form, ID card, or any other official University document. 7. Unauthorized Access to computerized academic or administrative record s or systems: viewing or altering computer records, m odifying computer programs or sy stems, releasing or dispensing information gained via unauthorized access, or interfering with the us e or availability of computer systems or information. All graded essays, papers, and problems, and all wr itten materials submitted as part of the Thesis Proposal or the Thesis, must be entirely the wo rk of the individual student or referenced appropriately. Even editing (e.g. syntax assistance for foreign students) should be sought only if explicit permission is obtained. If faculty observe or have knowledge of st udents engaging in any of the above-mentioned activities, the student should be confronted by the relevant faculty member at once. Students and faculty who believe that any of the above men tioned activities have o ccurred should report the matter in writing to the Dean of the Graduate School immediately. Within one week of notification of the infr action, the Dean will constitute a 3- member ad hoc committee to review the allegation of academic misconduct. In additi on, the student's first-year advisor, or MTA Director for later year students, will be added as a non-voting me mber of the ad hoc committee. The student may invite one faculty member to th e hearing to act as the student's advocate. A hearing should be held as soon as all parties can agree on a date and the committee will decide on appropriate consequences. If it is determined that the student has been involved in any form of academic misconduct, the student will receive an F for the assignment or c ourse and may be at risk for dismissal from the program. If the student wishes to appeal the d ecision of the Course Dire ctor or of the ad hoc Committee, this must be put in writing to the De an of the Graduate Schoo l within two weeks of receiving notification of the c onsequences of the incident of academic misconduct. The issue will then be pursued, via an appropriate tribunal, in accord with institu tional policy on research integrity. (Adapted from http://www.northwestern.edu/uacc/defines.html ; used with permission, D. Garrison) 9.1 The RCR Course and Curriculum All incoming students must complete a formal 1-credit course in Responsible Conduct of Research. The class employs a combination of te xts, documents, role-playing exercises, faculty and student discussions and small group discussions. Classes cover fundamental issues of training ethics, authorship, bioh azards, relationships in the research environment, mentoring, conflicts of interest, record k eeping, sharing reagents, etc. Attendance is mandatory to all sessions in the course. 99 The RCR curriculum continues with MTA-sponsored sessions. 9.2 Policies and Procedures on Ethical Practices in Research The School hereby affirms its commitment to the highest ethical standard s in the conduct of scientific research, the promoti on of original research of hi gh quality, and the importance of academic freedom. It also acknowledges that unethi cal conduct in research is extremely serious and threatens these principles. The School is, therefore, committed to preventing unethical conduct in research from occurring and, should it o ccur, to dealing with it swiftly, fairly and thoroughly. Procedures for handling allegations of misconduct in research are descri bed in detail in the Faculty Handbook (Chapter V I) at the following URL: http://www.mssm.edu/about-us/services- -handbook/research- environment/research-integrity . Allegations of rese arch should be reported to the Institution's Research Integrity Officer (RIO) who will have primary responsib ility for implementation of the institution's policies and procedures on unethical practices in research. The RIO has general responsibility for overseeing the investigation of all allegations of unethical conduct in research and shall be available to: Consult confidentially with persons uncertain about whether to submit an allegation of unethical research practices and if the alle gations do not involve une thical practices in research, refer the individual to other offices with responsibi lity for resolving the issue. Receive allegations of suspected unethical research practices and work with the Research Integrity Committee to determine and pursue the appropriate method for investigating and resolving these allegations. 9.3 Manuscript Policy In conformity with the principles of academ ic freedom, faculty members are not required to obtain prior approval before submitting a manus cript for publication or to amend such manuscripts to comply with suggestions made by others. However, it is recommended that faculty members provide Department Chairperso ns with copies of manuscripts prior to publication. Student Submission of Manuscripts No graduate student may submit a manuscript to a journal from the Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Mount Sinai's School of Me dicine or describe work conducted in the Program without review and approval by a facu lty member. That review should include the appropriateness of the authorship (s) and acknowledgment(s) of gran t support, as well as the substance of the report. Students should similarly subject all extramural applications to faculty review. 100 9.4 Policy on Responsibilities of Authors and Data Retention Responsibilities of Authors A clear designation, delineation a nd acceptance of authorship responsibility has been established which requires the following formal procedur e for the sign-off by all coauthors of all publications: A checklist will be signed by each author to signi fy that each coauthor has read the final submitted manuscript and verified the accuracy of the data bearing on his/her contribution. The checklist will indicate the re sponsible author for the paper. The checklist will stipulate the storage site of the data from which the publication is derived. The responsible author will be responsible for the receipt and retention of these statements and to make a \"best effort\" to obtain signatures from coauthors (see 4.A-1, above) who are not or no l onger on the faculty of Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Data Retention All original laboratory data books or journals, etc., from which a publication is derived, must be stored in the laboratory for a minimum of six y ears from the date of publication. If the senior author leaves Mount Sinai School of Medicine before the six year period elapses, he/she will be required to retain and make available, if request ed, to Mount Sinai School of Medicine all these data until the completion of this minimum tim e period. In the case of large ongoing database related research, the responsible investigator must retain the pertinent mass data storage device (hard drive, tape, disk, etc., not necessarily in hard copy) containing the data on which a publication is based. The stored data can be used for verification of data, as well as the base for ongoing studies of the same project. In the latter instance, howeve r, a clarifying statement that describes the nature and the composition of the reutilized and incremental data should accompany the publication. The data storage devi ce cannot be reused for unrelated projects. Although it is understood that this rule governing database storage may not be appropriate in all situations and over time, individual modificati ons must be approved by the Dean. For additional information see the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Handbook for Research (http://www.mssm.edu/about-us/services-a nd-resources/faculty-resources/handbooks-and- policies/rese arch-handbook ). 9.5 Policy and Procedures on Protecting Whistleblowers The School of Medicine strongly believes in the importance of protecting whistleblowers from retaliation and addressing good fa ith allegations of such reta liation. Accordingly, the School affirms that it will adhere to any applicable policies and procedures promulgated by federal or 101 other oversight agencies in d ealing with such allegations. Whistleblower complaints of retaliation may be brought, where appropriate, to the School's Faculty Relations Committee (see Faculty Handbook, Chapter III), Harassment Gr ievance Board (see Faculty Handbook, Chapter III), or Department of Human Resources. Copies of the policies and procedures of the Ha rassment Grievance Board are available from the Office of the Dean, Reserve Section of th e Levy Library, House Staff Affairs Office, Postdoctoral Affairs Office, Office of the Gra duate School, and Office of Student Affairs. Human Resources policies are available fr om the Department of Human Resources. 9.6 Policy on Financial Conflict of Interest in Research As an academic institution, The Mount Sinai Medi cal Center (\"Mount Sinai\") has an obligation to assure that its scientific and clinical research is conducted pursuant to the highest standards of ethical conduct free from any improper external bias. At the same time, Mount Sinai encourages scientific collaborati on with industry and supports collabo rative research geared towards developing new and improved diag nostic and therapeutic products . Mount Sinai appreciates, however, that these economic rela tionships with industry have the potential for directly and significantly affecting the approva l, design, conduct, monitoring or reporting of a research study. Situations can occur in which an independent observer might reasonably conclude that the potential for individual or in stitutional profit could influence the outcome of a research study. Even in the absence of an actua l conflict of interest, such situ ations may require actions to minimize the appearance of a conflict. Therefore, to safeguard the academic integrity of both Mount Sinai and its investigators, the institution has adopted a rigorous conflicts policy pred icated on full disclosu re and appropriate management. The Policy sets out th e requirements for disclosing potenti al conflicts of interest in research and specifies the procedures for revi ewing such disclosures and determining what corrective measures, if a ny, should be instituted. Furthermore, the policy subjects clinical trials that evaluate the safety and efficacy of a dr ug, medical device or tr eatment, and research on technology in which the Investigator/Covered Person and/or the Inst itution has an ongoing financial interest, to the most rigor ous review and stringent conditions. This Policy is based on the standards set forth in the federal regulati ons governing research funded by the Public Health Se rvice (PHS) or the National Sc ience Foundation (NSF) (42 CFR Part 50 Subpart F) and the recommendations pr omulgated by the Association of Academic Medical Centers. http://www.mssm.edu/static_files/MSSM/Files/A bout%20Us/Services%20and%20Resources/Facult y%20Resources/Handbooks%20and%20Policies/Ad ministrative%20Revisions%20to%20FCOIR%2 0Policy%2002-09-11.pdf 102 10. Student Services 10.1 Career Development The Graduate School and members of the Gradua te Faculty actively s upport the student run Graduate School Career Services (GSCS). This group organizes re gular seminars and workshops that increase the students' awar eness about the wide range of career options that may be of interest to students. The group al so provides role models and guida nce to students as they move toward the careers they seek. Invited speakers have included members of our own Graduate Faculty, alumni and individuals from a wide array of careers. Our alumni are another source of information and guidance. They have been generous and enthusiastic with their time, effort and mentorsh ip. They return individually and in groups to discuss their own career paths w ith current students in fora pr ovided by the Graduate School. The Graduate School is a charter member of the New York Science Alliance, a citywide consortium sponsored by the New York A cademy of Sciences. The Alliance sponsors workshops/symposia with dynamic speakers where a variety of career paths are explored. An annual event is \"What can you be with a PhD?\" which is organized by New York University and sponsored by research and academic institutions in the tri-state area, including Mount Sinai's Graduate School of Biological Sciences. 10.2 International Student Services The Office of International Personnel together wi th the Graduate School of Biological Sciences co-ordinate services for intern ational students who have been accepted to one of the school's graduate programs. The F-1 visa for Mount Sinai's international students is sponsored by Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Upon acce ptance into one of the programs at Mount Sinai, the student will be given the Application for Certification of Eligibility (I-20) Form. This form should be duly filled out and returned either in person to the Office of Interna tional Personnel at 320 94th Street, 5th floor or by fax at (212) 731-7804. All international students mu st register with the Office of International Personnel Office within 15 days of matriculation at Mount Sinai and must notify them of any changes in their academic program , enrollment status or if they plan to leave the country since their visa status may be at ri sk and appropriate action must be taken prior to leaving the country. Students must show proof of a valid I-20 be fore the fellowship package can be activated. It is the student's responsibility to make sure that s/he is always in status, as mandated by the US Homeland Security. All visa questions should be addressed to th e Office of Internationa l Personnel at (212) 731- 7744. 103 10.3 The Library Overview The Levy Library supports the edu cation, research, and clinical in formation needs of the Mount Sinai Medical Center.

On the back of the agreement for e-mail service is the code of conduc t for using e-mail. All students must be aware of and abide by these policies. http://www.mssm.edu/about-us/services-and-resour ces/computer-services/policies/email-usage Documentation, including paper reco rds, oral histories, video r ecordings, photographs, artifacts, and memorabilia relating to The Mount Sinai Hospital, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and The Mount Sinai Medical Center are available in the Archives. Among the earliest records are the original minutes of the Hospital Board dating from 1852. The Archives is open by appointment (ext. 47239). 10.4 Medical Insurance All graduate students are eligible for Hosp italization/Major Medical insurance. United Healthcare is the health care provider a nd students should visit their website at www.uhcsr.com to identify a primary care physician or specialist. For continuing students, open enrollment occurs in the month of July for the upcoming academic year. At that time, students have the option to enroll, disenroll, or change their insurance elections. No other changes will be processed for the year unless students have a specific qualifying event. Qualifying events include birth of a child, adoption, marriage, or divorce. In the case of a qualifying event, students only have 30 days from the date of the qualifying event to change their insurance benefits. Students who have inquiries regarding enrollment for medical insurance should contact Student Servi ces at (212) 241-5245 for information. NB: Medical insurance coverage will end on the la st day of the month in which the student terminates by depositing a thesis, unless the student terminates on the first day of the month, in which case, benefits will terminate on that day. 105 The MSSM Student United Healthcare cove rage provides coverage for physician and hospital services thr ough a network of participati ng physicians, laboratories, and diagnostic centers. These participants ar e listed in the provider book, located at www.uhcsr.com . The SHC center will use the network physicians for consultation referrals but it is up to the stude nt to verify that the provide r is in network prior to the appointment (as physicians' affiliations with insurance companies change frequently). There should not be any charge to you for the laboratory tests or x-ra ys if a participating laboratory is used. Specific coverage is outlined in the policy guide on the www.uhcsr.com website. Prescriptions are available for generic and brand medications with co-payment in the Mount Sinai Employee Pharmacy, provided the me dication prescribed is in the Pharmacy formulary. Students who rece ive prescriptions for medi cations not carried by the formulary can obtain prescriptio ns at a local drug store. Beginning in 2012, the Open Enrollment peri od for students takes place each July. During the month, students will have access to the Sinai benefits site, www.mtsinaibenefits.com to update their benefit choices. During this time period, students enroll or disenroll in any combina tion of health, dental, and vision coverage. However, students must always carry basic hea lth insurance. If a student disenrolls from the Sinai plan, they must file a waiver form in the Student Services Office and present proof of insurance from another source. When a student marries, has a child, or goes off their parent's insurance policy s/he must no tify the Student Services Office within 30 days of that event so that the pol icy can be altered appropriately. The MSSM UHC Student Insurance Plan covera ge runs from July 1 - June 30. Coverage will be terminated by the school upon graduation or if a student does not re-enroll for the next academic year. For PhD students only: Medical insurance coverage will end on the last day of the month in which the student terminates by depositing a thesis, unless the student terminates on the first day of the m onth, in which case, benefits will terminate on that day. Students can also use the Student Health Office for minor illnesses. For additional information you may call Nurse J eanine Burrell at (212) 241-6023). 10.5 Student Mental Health Service Rapid access to strictly confidential psychiatric consultation, counseling, treatment, and referral is available to students through th e Student Mental Health Servi ce. The Student/Trainee Mental Health Program through the Department of Psychi atry provides initial consultations and ongoing psychotherapy and medication management for thos e graduate students need of mental health services. The program consists of one psychiat rist and two PhD psychologi sts as well as various full-time and voluntary faculty members, who can see the student either on or off campus. A referral will be made if necessar y. The student's insurance will be billed for all services and the student will be responsible for a ny co-pay. To make an appointme nt for an initial consultation, 106 contact Dr. Madeleine Fershe at 212 659-8886. Emergency psychiatric services can be initiated by contacting the psychiat rist on-call through the page operator (212) 241-5581, or by calling the Psychiatric Emergency Service at (212) 241- 7147, or by direct unscheduled presentation to the emergency room; it is never necessary to call in advance. Student access to counseling and mental health services is considered by the school to be a private health matter of the utmost importance. The rule of complete confidentiality always applies, as in any relationship between a therapis t and patient. No person or office is notified or informed at any point that a student (or dependent) has seen or is seeing a counselor or psychiatrist through the Student Me ntal Health Service. Student use of the service is not made known to the school, and is never recorded on any transcript. Procedures The School of Medicine and the Department of Psychiatry have collaboratively established several completely confidential pathways of access into mental health care and enriched available resources beyond those afforded by the basic mental health insurance plan. 1. The Student Mental Health Service All correspondence with this office is completely confidential; there is no correspondence with the school by this o ffice whatsoever \u2014 unless specifically requested and formally endorsed in writing by the student. No record of any contact is made available to or acc essible to the school. The intent of this service is to provide direct access to specialized consultation with an absolute minimum of administrative complexity. When ongoing treatment is desired and indicated, informed referrals into affordable care are provided. 2. Self Referral Students may freely seek and establish mental health services enti rely independent of the Student Mental Health Service, or a ny other campus framework, by any means of their choosing, and fully utilize their mental health insuranc e benefit. In this pathway of access, if insurance is u tilized by the student, pre-approval of insurance must be obtained (see below). In this manner students may proceed into care by way of referral from a friend, family, primary care physici an, or insurance network. Students selecting this pathway for their ca re should be clearly mindful of several considerations: the distinction between \"in- network\" and \"out-of-network\" terms for insurance reimbursement (see below); that refe rrals other than thos e provided directly by the insurance company are nearly always \"out-of-network\"; and that an annual 30 visit limitation applies regardless of the ne twork designation of th e provider. Students 107 should also clearly note that referrals generated directly by the insurance company are virtually always to clinicians unaffiliated with Mount Sinai. 3. Student Health Referral Students may obtain a direct re ferral to a Mount Sinai c linician via Jeanine Burrell, R.N., of the Student Health Service at (212) 241- 6023. Referrals are made by Ms. Burrell to the \"out-of-network\" voluntary a nd full-time faculty on the roster described in (1) above. Referral requests remain strictly between Ms. Burrell, the student, and the clinician. No records of any kind are made available or are accessible to th e Dean's Office or medical school administration. Referrals conducted by Ms. Burrell are made in a general manner, without triage or consultation such as is provided by the Stude nt Mental Health Service. Ms. Burrell will not conduct a formal clinical psychiat ric assessment or inquiry to inform this referral. After a name has been provided to the student , the next step is to obtain pre-approval of insurance must be obtained to proceed into care with this \"out-of-network\" referral. \"Good-faith\" responsibilities for st udents will apply with regard to financial arrangements (see below). If the student feels that th e initial referral is unsuitabl e, s/he may request a second referral from Ms. Burrell. At any time the student may request a consultation with the Director of Student Mental Health as desc ribed in (1) above to more specifically inform the referral. Such consultation is required to obtain additional referrals if the student is dissatisfied with a sec ond referral as conducted by Ms. Burrell. 10.6 Infection Control All students are held to the Mount Sinai Medi cal Center's Infecti on Control Policies and Procedures. During orientation, st udents will be introduced to these policies and procedures. Further training is coordina ted by each degree program. Students who experience needle stick accidents and accidental blood/body fluid in the medical school will be supported (An exposure may be a perc utaneous injury, such as a needle stick, cut with a sharp object or bite, contac t of mucous membranes, contact of tissue, contact of skin when the exposed skin is chapped, abraded, or afflicte d with dermatitis, or the contact is prolonged or involving an extensive area with blood or tissue or body fluids.) . It is expected that students follow the published protocols immediately as anti-retroviral therapy for HIV exposure, if recommended, should commence immediately. Exposur e to hepatitis B or C may require therapy or further follow-up. Care, evaluation, and expert advice must be available to students regarding relative risks, options for therapy, and follow-up. C oordination of multiple affiliate sites has been 108 accomplished so that students have a clear idea of the protocol to follow and students receive state-of-the-art care. Students must attend annual seminars conducted by infection control experts and documentation of atte ndance will become a permanent part of the student's file. Students must follow protocol after a needle stick or other blo od/body fluid exposure. All policies for Infection Control at the affiliates maintain state-of-the-art standards, which are reviewed regularly by th e infection control experts at Moun t Sinai School of Medicine and the Division of Infectious Diseases of the Department of Medicine. All exposures should be reported to Student He alth. For complete information, view the Infection Control Handbook http://students.mssm.edu/infection/ 10.7 Student Health Services The Student Health Center is lo cated at 17 East 102 St Street, E Tower, 5th floor, Room 246/247 Student Health Center provides ad ministrative services to the school to ensure compliance for OSHA for immunizations and patient safety. The Student Health Ce nter provides medical evaluation and treatment required for matriculat ion, primary and preventive care, gynecological services, tuberculosis surveillance, and acute ca re for medical and gra duate students. Student Health handles annual physicals. Students may continue to use the SHC for illness and subspecialty referrals or may access physicians i ndependently. Students are encouraged to seek a primary care physician, especia lly for chronic disorders or the coordination of consultations. The Student Health Center hours ar e emailed to the student body re gularly. The staff consists of physicians and a full-time nurse. Students are en couraged to call for an appointment (ext. 46023) or may visit the Center on a walk-in basis. For after-hours emergencies, students may be seen in the emergency room of the hospital. An IMA Atte nding will be available to cover emergencies. Students must bring their insuranc e information with them and ma ke certain that the designated physician is in the plan. Visits will be billed to the student's in surance, but the student remains responsible for any co-payments or for any services not covered by their insurance. If the student needs to be admitted, s/he will be given the first available bed on a semiprivate service. All students must make arrangements to have a comprehensive physical examination done either by their private physician or by Stud ent Health prior to the start of year one and no later than September 10. If students choose to have a physi cal examination done by their private physician, the appropriate documentation of the physical exam must be submitted to student health by the September 10, deadline. A student health form for reporting purposes can be attained from the Student Health Center. Student s wishing to have the exam performed by the Student Health Center should call for an appointment. The school may require that a student be seen by our Student Health physicians. Adhering to this and other deadlines is considered an obligation in order to re main a student in good standing. Immunization Policy 109 Immunizations are required for di phtheria and tetanus (if not admi nistered within the past 10 years) and polio vaccine (if initial series and booster have not been gi ven). If students do not have immune titers to measles, mumps and rubell a, the appropriate vaccine will be administered. Hepatitis titers are performed on all entering studen ts. If students do not ha ve immune titers it is strongly recommended that studen ts receive the new recombinant hepatitis B vaccine which is provided free of cost. Follow-up titers are pe rformed post vaccination to verify protection. Varicella titers are performed on all entering st udents unable to document history of chickenpox. Hepatitis B and varicella vaccination are strongly recommended. Upon enrollment all MSSM students must have an annual PPD test for expos ure to tuberculosis. Annual PPD testing is required of all students and employees at Mount Sinai. At the beginning of each academic year, students must make an appointment to have a PPD test. Failure to do so will result in an interruption of a student's studies. Students will not be allowed to continue in classes, clerkships, or perform research in their assigned labs. Students who are recent converters will be managed appropriately with ches t x-rays to rule out the presence of active disease and prophylaxis with medica tions. Failure to follow appropria te treatment will result in dismissal from the institution. Individual health informati on is confidential; however, non-compliance with the above regulations is forwarded to the Registrar for \"student health hold\" and Program Directors (Graduate School) or the Admini strative Director of Student Affairs (Medical School) are notified. Dental and Vision Care Students have the option to elect dental and/or vision coverage at their expense. Policy information is available in the Office of Student Services. The same a nnual enrollment dates for Medical Coverage enrollment also pe rtain to Dental and Vision coverage. In addition, Mount Sinai has a dent al clinic that is available to provide emergency and routine services for medical and graduate students at a reduced fee. These services include oral examinations with x-rays and de ntal cleanings. More extensive services such as root canal therapy, prosthetic and cosmetic dentistry are available for a fixed fee to be explained and contracted for when needed. Students should chec k first with SHC for a ppropriate authorization and should bring their student ID a nd stipulate that they are a medical or graduate student. It is most effective to visit the clinic in person to ar range a time slot. The dental clinic is located on the second floor of the Annenberg buildi ng and can be reached at (212) 241-7121. 10.8 Disability Services The Director of Disability Services works with all Mount Sinai School of Medicine students in both the Medical School and the Graduate School to facilitate equal ac cess for students with disabilities by coordinating reasonable accommoda tions through a variety of support services (i.e.: access modification, learning rela ted technology, extended test times). The goal of Mount Sinai's Disability Services is to provide a physica lly and educationally 110 accessible educational environment so that each student is viewed on the basis of ability, not disability. Individually designed accommodation plans and services are determined based on the documented needs of each student in conjuncti on with their program requirements and are created to match the specific disability-rela ted need of each student with those program requirements in mind. Students who are seeking accommodations and serv ices are required to submit documentation of their disability. The Director of Di sability Services, Omayra Rolon (omayra.rolon@mountsinai.org ) in conjunction with an adviso ry group from the Medical School and Graduate School, has responsibility for dete rmining the acceptability of documentation and reserves the right to require additional informa tion. Students are asked to register by submitting the Application for Accommodations and Servi ces along with disability documentation. For further information refer to http://www.ms sm.edu/about-us/diversity/disability-officer Students with self-identified con cerns or problems related to a cademic performance or learning may contact the Disability Offi cer to request accommodations. Accommodations will not be implemented unt il the Application for Accommodations and Services has been submitted along with all disa bility documentation, the information has been reviewed and an official decision has been re ndered. Students should expect a minimum of one month to process accommodation requests and plan accordingly. 10.9 Housing The School of Medicine has made it a priority to provide convenient housing for students who are in the PhD, MD/PhD, and Genetics Counseli ng Program. Master students may be housed in Aron Hall on space available basis. Space will be re -evaluated annually on June 3rd. The Jane B. Aron Residence Hall at 50 East 98 Street offers modern and affordable housing for students. The 14-story building contains sh ared suites accommodating almo st 600 residents. Each suite consists of four to six private bedrooms a sh ared bathroom for each two rooms, a living room and a kitchen. Each room has an individual hea ting and air conditioning unit. Living rooms have parquet floors and large windows, and all suites are furnished. Among Aron Hall's facilities are outdoor handball and basketball cour ts, a laundry room, and an exerci se/gym room that is open to all medical and graduate students who can present their Mount Sina i student ID card. Security provisions include doormen around the cl ock, a call light near the front door to summon a security guard for escort to Mount Sinai, an intercom from the lobby to all suites, and television cameras in elevator s and ground floor areas. Buildi ng occupants are required to observe a number of security procedures; for ex ample, Mount Sinai ID cards must be presented to the doorman whenever occupa nts are entering the building. Furnished and unfurnished apartments in other buildings owned by Mount Sinai are available for students with a family size of more than one (1) as documented by proof of marriage or a domestic partnership. Documentation of the fa mily size is required. For further information please contact: MSSM Real Estate Office at (212) 659-9630 or hous ing@mountsinai.org 111 Student occupancy agreements are written for th e term of student enrollment. A non-graduating student who wishes to permanently leave M ount Sinai housing may be released from the occupancy agreement as of June 30 of the year by requesting this in writing at the Real Estate Office on or before May 31. Non-graduating stud ents, who vacate their Mount Sinai housing prior to June 30, or without givi ng proper notice, will be responsible for their rent until June 30.

For additional informati on, including lease terms, guest visitation policy, room transfer policy, and subleasing policy, please visit the website at: http://www.mssm.edu/education/student-resources/housing or contact: MSSM Real Estate Office 1249 Park Avenue, 1st Floor 112 New York, NY 10029 Tel: (212) 722-5096 Fax: (212) 831-3093 10.10 Safety and Security Identification Badges Identification badges are issued to all students at the time of registration and MUST BE WORN AT ALL TIMES in all campus buildings and upon entering any residence hall. Students will be asked to present cards for identif ication at the library, pharmacy, and so on. Lost cards may be replaced for a $10 fee, payable to the main cas hier. The receipt is presented to Security Administration who will issue a new badge. Property Passes It is the policy of Mount Sina i that no equipment (microscopes, slide boxes, computers and so on) be removed from the premises without a Mo unt Sinai Property Pass. Property passes are available from the Graduate Sc hool office during weekdays. Persona l property is often the object of theft and should be protected at all times. Th e Security Department endeavors to protect it also. For that reason it is requi red that persons leaving Mount Sinai with personal property (radios, lap top, and so on) obtain a Personal Prop erty Pass to expedite egress from the complex. Packages will be inspected by securi ty officers at entrances and exits. Security The Main Security Office is located at 1468 Madison Avenue, MC level, AMC-203. Security Guard stations are located at the entrance to a ll buildings on the campus. Security measures at Mount Sinai are reviewed continuously to prov ide a secure environment for all who use its facilities. The policy requiri ng all students, faculty, and em ployees to wear Mount Sinai identification within the complex is implemente d for protection and is enforced. The ID card must be displayed and worn upon entering all bu ildings and while on the premises. A student's personal security is of paramount importance. For this reason Security will, upon request, provide escorts with in Mount Sinai and to on-cam pus residences. Call ext. 46068/9 approximately 10 to 15 minutes prior to departure. Security is a function that requ ires the cooperation of everyone associated with the Mount Sinai. Students are requested to dial \"60\" on any phone in the event of any emergency or when suspicious activities are observed. At other times, when the assistance of the Security Department is needed, dial ext. 46068/9. A committee of the Student Council addressing h ousing and security exists and meets on a regular basis with Security to di scuss matters of concern. Cleary Act 113 Copies of Crime Statistics for the MSSM area are available in the Security Office and the Office of the Associate Dean for Stude nt Services. In addition, inform ation concerning the regulations and Mount Sinai crime statistic in formation is available through the U.S. Department of Education web site for campus crime statistics ( www.ope.ed.gov/security ). Emergency Alert System \"Message One\" In order to allow for a more coordinated and rapid response to emergency or disaster situations at Mount Sinai, the medical center has purchased a messaging system for faculty and students. The messaging system is called MessageOne. Message One has the capability of informing students of and delivering instructions regarding citywide, hospital, or student specific (e.g. student housing intruder) emergencies requi ring immediate attention. Signing up for this system is mandatory for all medical students, as medical students are considered First Responders in the state of New York and are expected to aid in an emergency. Graduate Students are highly encouraged to register as active members of the Mount Sinai community. During the on-line registration pr ocess, students have the option to set the method of contact (e.g. cell- phone, text message, email). Fire Safety One of the most serious issues facing the Mount Sinai Medical Center students, employees, and patients is the threat of fire. The risk is incr eased because work conducted in clinical, research and other laboratories may involve flammable liquids and other hazardous substances. In addition, the use of specialized equipment such as lasers and other ignition sources utilized in oxygen-enriched atmospheres increases the threat of fire. This threat is far more critical in patient care areas since patients are often incapable of self- pres ervation. It is critical to your safety as well as our patients' well-being that yo u know what to do in the event of an actual fire. This knowledge is imparted to you through participation in fire dri lls, and fire safety training in- services. CODE RED is the phrase used to al ert the Mount Sinai Community to enact the R.A.C.E. protocol for fire emergencies. R = Rescue A = Alarm C = Confine E = Extinguish The Mount Sinai Intranet, http://intranet1.mountsinai.org/ , under Core Administrative Services and Fire Safety Tabs, includes a link to the MS MC video entitled \"CODE RED\". Please take the time to view this important informational vide o and participate in your local fire drills. Sexual Assault Mount Sinai School of Medicine is committed to maintaining a supportive and safe educational environment, one that seeks to ensure the well being of all members of its community.

Recreation Recreational activities at Mount Sinai are determined by the st udent body and are administered jointly by the Recreation Office and two committees of the Student Council, one responsible for social activities and the other for athletic activi ties. Each committee is composed of one elected student from each of the four classes. At the beginning of the academic year, following discussion with their respective classes, th e Committee members formulate a program of activities for the entire academic year and al locate the necessary f unds. Individual students interested in a particular activity should cons ult appropriate class repr esentative. Students are urged to coordinate as many activities as po ssible through the two Student Council committees and the Recreation Office. In addition, the Recreation Office, (19 East 98 Stre et, Room 1E), also provides information about a wide range of activities. The Office offers discount tickets to Broadway and off-Broadway shows, concerts, operas, sports events and ot her events occurring in New York. For certain events such as the Metropolitan Opera a specific number of tic kets are allocated for student purchase; each student is permitted to buy two tickets.

Graduate School Special Programs Annual Retreat The Annual MD/PhD Retreat is he ld yearly over an early fall weekend off site. Activities include a keynote address by an internationally prominent scientist, a state-of-the program discussion between leadership and students, an alumni discussion panel, a poster and oral platform session, and small group breakout sessions fo cused on issues relevant to specific stages of training (preclinical, graduate, clinical). Ample time is set aside for activities such as hiking, bike riding or swimming. Atte ndees at the retreat typically include the Directors, faculty involved in the MD/PhD educat ion, alumni and students. Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) The Summer Undergraduate Research Program is sponsored and administered by the Graduate School as a vehicle for bringi ng research-oriented undergraduate students into our community during the summer. Each student is assigned an advisor for the duration of the ten-week long program. All summer students at Mount Sinai are invited to part icipate in a special summer Seminar Series, which includes seminars by gradua te faculty and graduate students, and a poster session at the end of their stay which features the work done by the fellows during the summer. This Program is highly competitive and emphasizes the recruitment of talented students from leading colleges and universities around the country. This is a ma jor recruitment activity of the Graduate School. Our faculty and graduate student s interact with the summer students as much as possible to act as mentors in their work a nd goals. Many of these students, with the approval of the mentor, continue to interact with the laboratories after termination of the fellowship. Preference for SURP application will be given to students intending to pursue PhD or MD/PhD studies. Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) This program which is supported by the Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) Program Branch of the Division of Minority Opportunities in Research (MORE) of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, provides a peri od of intensive research and other academic opportunities for recent college graduates from underrepresented minority groups who would like to enter graduate school in biomedical sciences. The Scholars will enhance their research experience and readiness for entry in to an excellent graduate program. Other Special Programs The Graduate School periodically sponsors spec ial seminars, workshops, and mini-courses in such areas as Philosophy of Science, Biohazards , Grant Proposals, and Careers in Biotechnology. Students are encouraged to help organize such programs in areas of interest to them. 117 12. Institutional Policies 12.1 Affirmative Action It is the policy of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine that a ll decisions regarding educational and employment opportunities and performance are made on the basis of merit and without discrimination because of race, gender, color, cr eed, age, religion, national origin, citizenship, disability, veteran status, marital status, sexua l orientation, genetic predisposition, or any other characteristic protected by law. Sexual harassment is defined as a form of sex discrimination and, therefore, any sexual harassment at the school will constitute a vi olation of the medical school's nondiscrimination policy. In keeping with our continuing efforts to achiev e a broadening of the representation of women and minority groups throughout the medical school, we have: Developed an Affirmative Action Program, which details actions designed to realize the School's commitment to equal educationa l and employment opportunities. Insured our compliance with Federal, State and Local laws and regulations implementing equal opportunity objectives by meeting the spirit as well as the letter of the law and contractual requirements. We cannot over-emphasize our commitment to the realization of these goals. Every decision affecting faculty, house staff, fellows, graduate students, employees, and medical students and other members of the medical school community re sts solely on demonstrab ly valid criteria of merit, competence and experience. Additional information concerning Mount Sinai's Affirmative Action Program, its interpretation and/or application may be obtained from the Affirmative Action Office located at 1245 Park Avenue, Ground Floor. 12.2 Alcohol and Drugs The following statement describes the medical sc hool's policy regarding s ubstance abuse for all employees, which include faculty, administratio n, house staff, students, graduate students, fellows, bargaining and non-bargaining unit empl oyees. The medical school has a significant interest in ensuring that the work environment is free from the hazards to patients, employees, and visitors that are created due to the unauthorized use of alcohol, drugs, or controlled substances. The illegal sale, manufacture, dist ribution, or unauthorized use of drugs or controlled substances off-duty whether on or o ff medical school premises or reporting to classes or clerkships under the influence of un-authorized drugs or cont rolled substances ma y constitute grounds for immediate dismissal. 118 The unauthorized use or possession of alcoholic beverages on medical school premises or reporting to School under the influence of alcoho l also may constitute grounds for immediate dismissal. The medical school may in its discretion take ap propriate disciplinary ac tion up to and including termination against anyone who has violated the above rules. In some cases, the individual in question may be referred for counseling a nd treatment through the Employee Assistance Program. The School is under no obligation to re fer an employee who has violated the above rules to the Employee Assist ance Program or to any ot her rehabilitation program. Any employee or student who is suspected of being under the influence of any alcoholic beverage or drug while on duty and who refuses to be medically evaluated or to release the results of such evaluation to the medical school (as employer) or appropriate administrative officer of the School will be relieved from duty and will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 requires The Mount Sinai Medical Center, as a Federal grant recipient and contractor, to certify that it will provide a drug-free workplace. This is accomplished by providing to each employee or student engaged in a federal grant or contract, a copy of The Medical Center's Drug-Free Workplace policy and statement, and requiring that as a condition of employment under such a gr ant or contract the employee will: Abide by the terms of this Statement; and Notify the Director of Human Resources and Labor Relations or hi s/her designee of any criminal drug statute conviction for a viol ation occurring in the workplace no later than five (5) days afte r such conviction. A Drug-Free Awareness Program has been establishe d to inform all employees about the dangers of drug abuse in the workplace, The Medical Center's policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace, the available drug counseling, rehabili tation and employee assistance programs, and the potential penalties for drug abuse violations. The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) offers professional guidance couns eling and a referral service for substance abuse, as well as othe r concerns, to students, employees and their immediate families free of charge. For confiden tial information, contac t EAP at (212) 241-8937. 12.3 Drug Testing All incoming students are re quired to undergo drug/alcoho l screening. Subsequently, drug/alcohol testing may be requested of any student, at any time, including: When concerns about subs tance use issues arise. When any student returns from a leave of any kind. When a student self-reports a problem. 119 Failure to undergo testing as requested will result in dismissal from the school. Drug/alcohol testing is conducted bo th to provide an environment th at is safe for our patients and that promotes the highest possible level of lear ning and professionalism in our students. While the school of medicine maintains a drug-free wor kplace in compliance with federal regulations, it also strives to foster an atmosphere of ope nness about drug and alcohol related issues. Although people often have strong preconceptions about substance use and drug/al cohol testing, such testing is done out of concern for the well-being of our students and of th eir current and future patients. It is therefore neith er uncommon nor prejudicial. 12.4 Alcohol Policy - Levinson Student Center The policy of the School of Medici ne regarding alcoholic beverage s in the Patricia and Robert Levinson Student Center is to maximize student util ization of the Center while assuring that clear policies are in place. Alcohol is permitted in the Student Center at events sponsored by student organizations or Departments within M SSM under the following circumstances: A student-run organization that is recognized by Student Coun cil is sponsori ng the event. No student or guest under the age of 21 will be served or permitted to consume any alcoholic beverage. Alcoholic beverages are not sold at the event. Alcohol must not be taken out of the Student Center into other areas of Mount Sinai. Serving alcoholic beverages is always in the context of servin g food and non-alcoholic beverages. A specific student (or students) is iden tified as responsible for the event. The responsible student will monitor the event so that anyone who is clearly intoxicated is not served any more alcohol. If a person has become intoxicated, steps shoul d be taken to try a nd help the individual sober up prior to leaving the party. The responsible student monitoring the event mu st make certain that any person that has become intoxicated will not be allowed to drive. Cab fare should be provided, if necessary, or an escort should be provided to ensure that the pers on gets home safely. The Administrative Director of Student Affairs is notified in writing about the event at least one week in advance with the clear statement that al coholic beverages are planned as part of the food and beve rage service serving as th e application for a permit. Funding for alcoholic beverages will not come from tuition resources nor be supported by the Department of Medical Education budget. There MUST be a written permit statement prio r to the event and the responsible person(s) should have the permit with them at the event. The Security Department will be notified that alcohol will be served at the ev ent. Under no other circumstances should alcoholic beverages be used or available in the Levinson Student Ce nter. Please contact the Event Coordinator of Student Affairs to attain a permit or for questions. 120 12.5 Acquired Immune Deficiency The School of Medicine in concert with the ot her medical schools in the state, has formally stated its commitment to accept as its most fund amental responsibility th e care of all patients seen in its facilities, includi ng those who are positive for the human immune deficiency virus (HIV). This commitment extends to all faculty, residents, and students. The School is equally committed to the education and counseling of al l health care professionals including medical students, to eliminate misperceptions concerning the risks of caring for AIDS as well as the appropriate precautions to be taken for preventio n of transmission of HIV, Hepatitis-B virus and other blood-borne infections. 12.6 POLICY ON HARASSMENT I. Statement of Purpose Harassment has become an increasingly prominen t national concern in the workplace and in academic institutions. MSSM regards any behavior that is harassing, discriminatory, or abusive as a violation of the standards of conduct requir ed of all persons associ ated with the academic mission of the institution. The id eal of American medical, gradua te and postgraduate education is to create an environment that nurtures respec t and collegiality between educator and student. In the teacher-student relationship, each party has certain legitimate expectations of the other. For example, the learner can expect that th e teacher will provide instruction, guidance, inspiration, and leadership in learning. The teach er expects the learner to make an appropriate professional investment of energy and intellect to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to become an effective physician or scientist. The social relationships required in the achievement of this academic ideal - mentor, peer, professional, staff - require the active trust of partnership, not the dependence of authoritarian dominance and submission. MSSM is responsible for providing a work a nd academic environment free of sexual and other forms of harassment. The institutio n may pursue any complaint of harassment known to it in order to achieve this goal . A Grievance Committee (the \"Committee\") was established in 1992 to serve as an educationa l resource to the medical school community on issues relevant to harassment and to addre ss complaints of sexual harassment and other forms of harassment and abuse as defined belo w. Complaints abou t implementation of school policies concerning appointment, promotion, and distri bution of resources, including notification requirements associated with these policies, will not be addressed by this Committee unless they involve, in additi on to those complaints, an allegation of harassment or abuse as defined below. Th e Committee (and an appointed Investigative and Hearing Board (the \"Board\") under Paragraph IV.C.2. below, if any) may only consider complaints of harassment and abuse brought by any faculty member, medical or graduate student, house staff or postdoctoral fellow against any other such member of the School community. Complaints by and agains t other employees of MSSM will be handled by other appropriate existing grievance mech anisms (e.g., those available through Human Resources). The Committee may act (at the Co mmittee's discretion) before or after other action(s) an individual may take to exercise his/her rights both within and outside the 121 institution . The Committee will attempt, whenever possible, to emphasize mediation and conciliation. It will rely on discreet inquiry and trust in dea ling with complaints that are brought for its consideration. Confidentiality will be maintained to the maximum extent possible consistent with the need to investigate complaints and with the requirements of the law. Full cooperation with the Committee and an appointed Board, if any, is required of all members of the community. To ensure an environment in which education, work, research, and disc ussion are not corrupted by abuse, discrimination and harassment, the fo llowing statement has been created to educate members of the academic community about wh at constitutes harassment and about the mechanism for the receipt, considera tion, and resolution of complaints. Issues also may be brought up during the Steering Committee of the Student Council's monthly meetings with the Dean, the Dean for Medical Education, the Dean of the Graduate School and the Associate Deans. It must be emphasized that appropriate profe ssional behavior is expected of all members of the School of Medicine and the Hospital. Harassment in any form will not be tolerated. Consistent with Chapter 739 of the State Educ ation Department signed into law in 1990, information concerning prevention of sexual assault will be provided to all entering students. In addition, the library will have information available concerning the legal consequences of sex offenses. A committee of the Student Council addressing housing and security exists and will meet on a regular basis with Security to discuss matters of concern. II. Definitions of Unacceptable Behavior Certain behaviors are inherently destructive to the relationships that are required in a community organized to provide medical a nd graduate education. Behaviors such as violence, sexual and other harassment, abuses of power and discrimi nation (based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, veteran status , age, disability, citi zenship, marital status, genetic predisposition or any ot her characteristic protected by law) will not be tolerated. A. Sexual Harassment is defined as unwel come sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and/or other verbal or physi cal conduct of a sexual nature when: 1. submission to such conduct is made either e xplicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment or academic success. 2. submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for employment or academic decisions affecting such an individual. 3. such conduct has the purpose or effect of unr easonably interfering with an individual's work or academic performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work or academic environment. Sexual harassment is a violation of institutional policy and of city, state and federal laws. Sexual harassmen t need not be intentional to violate this 122 policy. Examples of sexual harassment in clude, but are not limited to: sexual assault inappropriate sexual advances, propositions or demands unwelcome physical contact inappropriate persistent public statements or displays of sexually explicit or offensive material which is not legitimately related to employment duties, course content or research threats or insinuations, which lead the victim to believe that acceptance or refusal of sexual favors, will affect his/her reputa tion, education, employment or advancement derogatory comments relating to gender or sexual orientation In general, though not always, sexual harassment o ccurs in circumstances where the harasser has some form of power or authorit y over the life of the harassed. As such, sexual harassment does not fall within the range of pe rsonal private relationships. Al though a variety of consensual sexual relationships are possible between medical supervisors and trainees, such relationships raise ethical concerns because of inherent inequa lities in the status and power that supervisors wield in relation to trainees. Despite the consensu al nature of the relati onship, the potential for sexual exploitation exists. Even if no professional relationshi p currently exists between a supervisor and a trainee, entering into such a re lationship could become problematic in light of the future possibility that th e supervisor may unexpectedly as sume a position of responsibility for the trainee. B. Discrimination is defined as actions on the part of an individual, group or institution that treat another individual or group differently because of race, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion, veteran status, age, disability, citizenship, marital status, genetic predisposition or any other characteristic protec ted by law. Discrimination or harassment on the basis of these characteristics violates federal, st ate, and city laws and is prohibited and covered by this policy. C. Abuse is defined, for purposes of this polic y, as behavior that is viewed by society and by the academic community as exploitative or pu nishing without appropriate cause. It is particularly objectionable when it involves the abuse of authority. Examples of behavior, which may be abus ive, include, but are not limited to: habitual conduct or speech that creates an intimidating, demeaning, degrading, hostile, or otherwise seriously offensiv e working or educational environment physical punishment repeated episodes of verbal punishment (e.g. public humiliation, threats and intimidation) removal of privileges without appropriate cause grading or evaluations used to punish rath er than to evaluate objective performance assigning tasks solely for punishment rather than educational purposes 123 repeated demands to perform personal services outside job description intentional neglect or intentional lack of communication requirements of individuals to perform unpleasan t tasks that are enti rely irrelevant to their education and employment that ot hers are not also asked to perform Constructive criticism, as part of the learning process, does not constitute harassment. To be most effective, negative feedback should be de livered in a private set ting that fosters free discussion and behavioral change. III. Office of the Ombudsperson The Institutional Ombudsman is Barry Stimmel, MD who is available to any student to give counsel and feedback and to di scuss informally any situation they have encountered and the nature of any discrimination or abuse, and so forth. This Office is a confidential resource for students except in cases where legal action is needed (e.g., unlawful discrimination or harassment, assault/harm to student or patient). IV. Grievance Committee A. Purview The Committee is charged with addressing any co mplaint of harassment or abuse brought by any member of the faculty, medical or graduate stud ent, house staff officer or postdoctoral research fellow against any other such member of the school community. B. Composition of the Committee The Committee will consist of at least 22 members. Among thes e will be 2 with counseling experience, 2 medical students, 2 graduate students, 2 house staff, 2 faculty with administrative appointments, and 2 research postdoctoral fello ws. Faculty members of the Committee will be representative of both basic scienc e and clinical, junior and senior faculty. Every effort will be made to have the Committee reflect the full di versity of the medical school population. The Chairperson of the Committee (the \"Chairperson\") shall be a faculty member with experience in counseling and who does not have an admini strative appointment. All members of the Committee, including the Chairperson, will be ap pointed by the Dean after consultation with relevant groups in the School. Faculty will se rve staggered 3-year rene wable terms; students, postdoctoral fellows and house officers wi ll serve renewable 1-year terms. V. Grievance Procedures A. Any member of the faculty, any medical or graduate student, house officer or postdoctoral research fellow who believes that he or she has been harassed or abused by any other such member of the School co mmunity may contact any member of the Committee or the Chairperson to seek advice, or may submit a written complaint to the Committee. The Committee member contac ted can discuss the matter with the complainant, advise the complainant of his/ her alternatives in pursuing the complaint, 124 including, if the complainant agrees, (a nd where permitted by law), helping the complainant to resolve the complaint inform ally without revealing the complainant's name. Such help may include, but is not lim ited to, assisting the complainant in drafting a letter to the alleged offender asking that he/she stop the beha vior, or coaching the complainant in preparation for a conversation with the alleged offender. The complainant may ask the Committee member to meet directly with the person accused to seek a resolution. If the complaint includes an alleged violation of law, the Committee member initially contacted must bring the complaint to the full Committee, the complaint must be fully documented and investigated, and a report made to the Dean. B. Upon request of the complainant to th e Committee member originally contacted, or upon receipt of written complaints to the Co mmittee, or when required by law, the complaint, with the names of the complainan t, respondent and depa rtment withheld, will be discussed by the Committee at its next regular meeting. C. Following discussion of the co mplaint, the Committee has 2 options: 1. It can decide that even if the allegation is true, it does not constitute harassment or abuse. The complainant will be notified of the finding and can be offered guidance and/or assistance in resolving the matter, or be referred to another, more appropriate venue, such as Human Resources, the Faculty Relations Committee or a Tenure Review Committee to pursue the complaint. 2. It can decide that the allegation is sufficiently serious to warrant further investigation. Unless previously submitte d, the complainant will be requested to submit a full written account of the comp laint. Upon receipt of the written complaint, the Chairperson will appoint a five-member Board and two alternates. The Chairperson will serve as chair of the Board (or, in case of conflict of interest or other inability to serve, appoint an other Committee member) and will appoint at least 4 additional individuals and at least 2 alternates to consider the complaint. Students, postdoctoral fellows, and house staff members are to be excluded from the Board in cases involving a faculty member alleging harassment by another faculty member. In cases involving a student, postdoctoral fellow or house staff (either as an accuser or accused), at leas t one of the members of the Board will be from the same group. Each Board will have at least one member with experience in counseling, and at least 3 faculty. D. Upon selection of the Board, the complain ant will be notified of the names of Board members, and will have 48 hours from receipt of such notificati on to challenge, in writing, any member for cause. The respondent will be notified that a complaint has been brought against him/her, the name of the comp lainant, the nature of the complaint, and the names of the members of the Board. Th e respondent shall also have 48 hours from receipt of notification to chal lenge, in writing, any member of the Board for cause. In the 125 event of a challenge, the Chairperson will decide on the merits and replace Board members if necessary. In the event that the Chairperson is unable to appoint a sufficient number of members not disqua lified for cause, the Dean will appoint additional members. E. Investigative and Hearing Board Procedures. The preliminary stages of the investigation may consist of meetings of one or more members of the Board with the complainan t, respondent and other members of the community who might have relevant informati on. In the event that preliminary meetings have been held, all information obtained in th ese meetings will be shared with the entire Board. In all meetings, confidentiality will be stressed. The respondent will receive the full written complaint with the supporting documentation provided by the complainant to the Board and will be afforded two weeks to provide a written response. This response will be dist ributed to the Board and provided to the complainant. The Board will then hold one or more hear ings, which the complainant and respondent will attend, either individually or together , along with any other witnesses the Board deems relevant to the complaint. At the he aring, each of the parties may be accompanied by an advisor, who is a member of the Mount Sinai community, but who is not a lawyer, and who will not function as an advocate during the hearing. At the close of the hearing(s), the Board wi ll deliberate the findings without the presence of either the complainan t or the respondent. Upon concluding its deliberations , the Board will vote on whether or not there has been a violation of this policy based on a majority vote. Recommendations for remedial actions will be discussed. A full report will be drafted, including the findings, vote and recommendations of the majority. It will then be submitted to the Dean. The Board's written report will include: a) a determination that a viola tion of this policy did or did not take place b) a listing of its findings of fact c) a summary of the written submissions of the parties d) a summary of testimony at the hearing e) a summary of evidence gathered during the investigation f) the conclusions it has drawn from this material g) its recommendations for ac tion to be taken by the Dean. The Board may recommend sanctions base d on the severity of the offense. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, verb al reprimand, written reprimand, change in job responsibilities, suspension, discharge, and expulsion. 126 The Board and/or the Committee may, at their discretion, modify the Grievance Procedures depending on the nature of a particular complaint. F. Dean's Review The Dean may accept or reject conclusions and/or recommendations of the Board. However, in the event the Dean does not accept either the Board's conclusions or its recommendations, he/she will meet with the Bo ard to discuss the reasons for the rejection before recording a final decision on the matter. The Dean will convey his/her decision in writ ing to the complainant, respondent and the Board. VI. Protection from Retaliation All individuals involved in registering a co mplaint, serving as representatives for the complainant or respondent, as witnesses, or on the Committee will be free from any and all retaliation or reprisal or threats thereof. Th is principle applies with equal force after a complaint has been adjudicated. Upon submission of a complaint or thre at of retaliation, the Committee will review the facts and recommend appropriate action. VII. Re-Evaluation of Procedures The Committee will review the grievance proced ures periodically. Proposed changes, approved by a majority of the Committee, must be revi ewed and approved by the Office of the General Counsel before being implemented. 12.7 Family Education Rights and Privacy Act The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 and its subsequent amendments afford students certain rights with re spect to their educationa l records. Copies of this Act are available in th e Office of the Registrar. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and its subsequent amendments afford students certain rights with respect to their educational r ecords. Copies of th is Act are available in the Office of the Registrar. As de tailed below, students have the right to: A. Inspect and review thei r education records. B. Seek amendment of their education records if they believe them to be inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in viol ation of their privacy rights. C. Consent to certain disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in their education records. D. File complaints with the Department of E ducation concerning any alleged failure to comply with FERPA's requirements. 127 Student Access Rights All currently registered and form er students at Mount Sinai School of Medicine have the right to review and inspect their official education records at th e School in accordance with these rules. Official education records ar e those regularly maintained by the School. These include admissions and academic records prepared and ma intained by the Registrar. Students who wish to review their records should make an appointment with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or the Registrar. Access will be gr anted within 45 days from the receipt of the written request to inspect records. Students have a right to a response to a reasonable request for expl anations and interpretations of the student's educational records. Students s eeking explanations or in terpretations of their educational record may make an appointment with the Associate Dean of the Graduate School or Associate Dean for Student Affairs-Medical Ed ucation, as appropriate based on the student's program. If the Associate Dean is unable to provide a satisfacto ry explanation, the student will be referred to the Dean of the Graduate School or Dean for Medical Educ ation, as appropriate. Students may not copy records unless the failure to produce copies would prevent the student from exercising his/her right to inspect and review records Limitation on Access The Act limits a student's right to access inform ation contained in his/her education records. Accordingly, the School need not permit students to view: A. Financial records, including information re garding the student's parent (s), including parental tax forms and other parental record s submitted in support of a student's financial aid application or claim of New York residence. B. Confidential statements and letters of recomme ndation placed in a student's file prior to January 1, 1975 provided they are used for th e purpose for which they were specifically intended. C. Confidential letters of recommendation placed in the student's file after January 1, 1975, if: 1. The student has waived his/her ri ght to inspect and review those letters. 2. The letters are related to the studen t's (a) admission to an educational institution; (b) application for empl oyment; or (c) receipt of an honor or honorary recognition. D. Records of instructional, administrative and supervisory staff, which are in the sole possession of such personnel. E. Records of professional and paraprofessional personnel, wh ich are created , maintained 128 and used solely for the purpose of treatmen t and are not available to anyone other than the individual providing the treatment; the st udent has the right, however, to have such records reviewed by an appropriate professional of his/her choice. Mount Sinai School of Medicine does not requir e students to waive their right of access to educational records and waiver of access rights is not a conditi on for admission to the School or for receipt of financial aid or other services or benefits from the School. Under certain circumstances, however, a student may wish to waive his/her right of access to confidential letters of recommendation. A stude nt may do so by signing a waiver form. In this event, the student will be notified upon reque st of the names of persons ma king such recommendations and the recommendations will be used solely for th e purpose for which they are intended. A waiver may be revoked in writing with respect to actio ns occurring after the revocation. Waiver forms are available in the Registrar's Office. Amendments and Hearing Rights If a student believes that his/ her education records contain information that is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student's righ ts of privacy, he or she may ask the School to amend the record. Requests for amendments shall be directed to the Registrar, who will respond to the request within a reasonable time. If the request is denied, the student will be notified of his/her right to appeal that decision as specified below. When the request for an amendment is denied, th e student may request a h earing to challenge the content of the record on the grounds that the info rmation contained in the record is inaccurate, misleading or in violation of the student's privacy rights. Requests for hearing must be submitted in writing to the Associate Dean of the Gra duate School or the Asso ciate Dean for Student Affairs - Medical Education (a s appropriate) within 10 days of receiving the Registrar's response denying a request for amendment as discussed above. Hearing 1. The hearing will be held before the Dean of the Graduate School or the Dean for Medical Education, as appropriate. 2. A hearing will be held within a reasonable time after receipt of the request for hearing. The student will be given notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing. 3. The student shall have a full and fair opportunity to presen t evidence relevant to show that the information at issue is inaccurate, misleading, or violates the student's privacy rights. The student may be assisted or re presented by an individual of his/her choice, including an attorney. The role of attorneys, however, may be limited at the discretion of the Dean hearing the case. The decision, which shall include a summary of the evidence presented at the hearing and reasons for the decision, shall be rendered in wri ting within 15 business-da ys after the conclusion of the hearing. This hearing will relate only to whether the student's record is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the privac y of the student, with the decision based solely on evidence presented at this hearing. The h earing cannot determine whether a higher grade should have been assigned. 129 If it is determined after a hear ing that the record in question should be amended, the Registrar will take appropriate steps to amend the record a nd will so notify the student in writing. If it is determined that the record is not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwis e in violation of the student's privacy rights, the student shall be informed of his/her right to place a statement in the record commenting on the contested informa tion in the record or stating why the student disagrees with the School's decision not to amend the record. This statement will be maintained as part of the record and will be disclosed whenever the part of the record to which the statement relates is disclosed.

The School will make a reasonable attempt to notif y the student of disclosures made pursuant to Section 1(a) and 1(c-l) above. Upon request, the School will give the student a copy of the record disclosed. A student has a right to a hear ing to challenge certain disclosures consistent with the procedures outlined above. Directory Information The Mount Sinai School of Medicine has designate d the following information from a student's education record as \"directory information,\" which may be di sclosed under FERPA without the student's permission: Name Student Address Student Phone Number Degree Program(s) & Major Field of Study Degree(s) Earned and Date(s) Dates of Attendance Full-/Part-Time Enrollment Status Parent's Names Parent's Address Parent's Phone Number Academic Awards and Honors MSSM email address Prior Postsecondary Institution(s) Attended Photograph/Digitized Image Participation in officially recognized MSSM activities Students' contact information is included in the student direct ory and published through WebEd. Preventing Disclosure of Directory Information At matriculation, a student signs a statement consenting to or refu sing inclusion of the student's directory information. Students may change that permission by submitting an updated Disclosure of Directory Information Form to the Registrar's Office at the start of each academic year. Directory information about former student s is not subject to these requirements. The Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the Offi ce of the Registrar will exercise discretion in the release of all directory information. In a ddition, The Mount Sinai School of Medicine does 131 not release or sell directory information to a ny outside entity for commercial, marketing or solicitation purposes.

Information Sharing and Confidentiality MSSM recognizes that confidentialit y is very important to student s. It is a basic right and privilege and we believe that the issue of confidentiality is part of the trust that we expect and 132 value among students, teachers and administra tive personnel. The following clarifies the protection of informati on related to students: Health Information A. All student health information is protected information. There should be no sharing of information except as provided by HIPAA fo r the care of the student as patient. Teachers, administrative personnel and deans may not receive health information from students' health care provider s except as provided by HIPAA B. There is certain information that hospitals and health care facilities require as a condition of employment. That info rmation includes PPD, immunizations, and in some cases evidence of toxicology results. Students will be informed that that information is being shared as obtained by Student Health as composite data (we only know who does not comply with completing this information and then would deny clinical privileges but do not know the exact results) C. Toxicology screening is an institutional requ irement. Any positive result will be reviewed by senior administrative repr esentatives of the Deans (G raduate School and Medical School). The school may require a toxicol ogy screen from any student at any time without need for a stated reason. Failure to comply with toxicology testing in the timeframe required will result in dismissal from school. D. There are times when the Administration may ask a student to comply with an Administrative Psychiatric eval uation. When it is decided that such an evaluation is necessary, the student will be informed and will be apprised of the list of questions that will be sent to an administra tive evaluator (usually a psychiatrist). Students do not have the option to decline such an evaluation wh en required and would be dismissed from school if they fail to comply. The information referred back to the School will be discussed with the student and will remain in the student's file which can only be opened by a Dean or his official representative or if requested as a legal document. Academic Information Academic information is maintain ed by the School Registrar. A. Students have access to their academic file for re view but will not be given copies of their file. B. The Registrar will not permit dissemination of the file information without the signed consent of a student unless required by law in accordance with FERPA Policy. C. Current teachers and clerkship directors do not have access to the student file, only deans and student affairs personnel in th e Medical School may access the file. D. Any student wishing to review their file ma y do so in the presence of the Registrar or Dean's Designee coordinate d through the Registrar. Other information If a student seeks counsel from a director, d ean, teacher or ombudsman that information should remain confidential between the student and that individual. A. Any plan to discuss information (e.g., Offi ce of Student Affairs Representative or Program Director with one of the Dean's) s hould be with the st udent's knowledge and consent. 133 Exceptions to this confidentiali ty include concerns about the safety of the student, someone related to the student, or the st udent's dependent. Safety con cerns include su icidal ideation, homicidal ideation, harming anot her individual substance depende ncy, behavioral or health concerns that may affect the student or others. Access to Graduate Student Files The Graduate School will shar e students' academic history on a \"need-to know\" request by faculty (course directors, advisors and MTA directors) in order to evaluate the student's progress and to facilitate the appropriate level of remedi ation, if necessary. This policy pertains only to information in files maintained by the Graduate School/Program.. Information about a student may be related to academic performance or professional behavior. It should be emphasized that the purpose of this policy is to use constructive feedback in the educational process for the benefit of the st udent and to be suppor tive of the student's educational growth. Information about a stud ent's marginal or failing performance and any documented issues related to pr ofessionalism may be shared, subj ect to approval by the Dean or Associate Dean of the Graduate School. This wi ll ensure that the student is aware that his/her performance is being monitored and that remediation may be recommended. The Graduate School Dean or Associate Dean will m onitor this in a confidential manner 12.8 Campus-Wide Policies, Regulations, and Requirements: Introduction In accordance with the requirements of the Education Law of the State of New York, the Trustees of Mount Sinai School of Medicine have adopted rules fo r the maintenance of order and have established a program for their enforcement: Rules of Conduct 1. All members of the School community, whic h for the purposes of these Rules and Regulations shall be defined as including faculty, students, organizations, members of the staff of the School, and all visitors and other licensees and invitees are expected to obey all national, state and local laws. 2. All members of the School community are prohibited from conduct which is proximate cause of or does unreasonably and unduly impede , obstruct or interfere with the orderly and continuous administration and operation of the School in the use of its facilities and the achievement of its purposes as an educational institution, or in its rights as a campus proprietor. Such conduct shall in clude, but is not limited to, that which is the actual or proximate cause of any of the following: A. Unreasonable interference w ith the rights of others; B. Intentional injury to School property; C. Unauthorized occupancy of classrooms , laboratories, libraries, faculty and administrative offices, patient care faci lities, auditoriums, public halls and stairways, recreational ar eas and any other facilities used by the School 134 (unauthorized occupancy being defined as failure to vaca te any such facility when duly requested by the Dean, an Associ ate Dean, Assistant Dean, Hospital Administrator of similar responsibility or chair of a department of the School); D. Malicious use of or intentional damage to personal property, including records, papers and writings of any memb er of the School community; E. Any action or situation whic h recklessly or intentionally endangers the mental or physical health or involves the forced consumption of liquor or drugs for the purpose of initiation into or affiliation w ith any organization. The penalties set forth in Part II are in add ition to any penalty pursuant to the penal law or any other chapter to whic h the violator or or ganization may be subj ect for violation of this paragraph. 1. Violations of these policies and regulations by students shall be referred to the Dean for Medical Education and, if warranted, to the Disciplinary Tribunal. 2. Nothing contained in any of the foregoing Rule s and Regulations is in tended to nor shall it be construed to limit or restrict freedom of speech or of peaceful assembly, or other individual rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Student Behavior The administration and faculty of the School are committed to providing a safe and healthy learning environment for all students. Stude nts should conduct themselves appropriately everywhere on the campus of Mount Sinai, and at affiliated institutions. Appropriate behavior is mandatory when participating in patient care or attending any functions at which patients may be present. In small group seminars, as well as duri ng clinical activities, stud ents are evaluated not only on their fund of knowledge and ability to use this knowledge but also on their responsibility, dependability, reliability, maturity , motivation, attitude, honesty, integrity, and ability to relate and interact effectively with others. Equally important, however, is the realization th at one's responsibilities do not end with individual behavior but also include not tolerating inappropria te behavior among others. While formal mechanisms, outlined in other sections, exist to provide due process for any specific allegations of inappropriate behavior, general is sues should be able to be discussed freely among peers, faculty, and administration. Concerns requ iring confidentiality sh ould be discussed with the Dean of Graduate School, individual facu lty advisors, or through the School's Ombudsman Program. Faculty, Staff, and Student Relations Just as students are expected to behave in an ap propriate and professional manner at all times, so also are faculty, staff, and other employees. A ny allegations concerning harassment, abuse, or inappropriate professional behavi or should be brought directly to the attention of one of the Associate Deans of the Graduate School or to a member of the Harassment Committee and Grievance Board. The Executive Faculty has approved the follo wing statement of principles concerning 135 interactions among faculty, house staff, and students: All interpersonal interactions at Mount Sinai School of Medi cine will be conducted in an atmosphere of respect and concern for the dign ity of every individual. Under no circumstances will patients, students, faculty, or staff of Mount Sinai be treated, spoken to, or spoken about in a demeaning manner. Insulting language or behavior must not be tolerated. Faculty, house staff, and students are encouraged to speak up directly and immediately agains t unacceptable behavior or speech. If a house officer or student feels th at it would be unwise to pursue such a matter directly, s/he should discuss the issue promptly with an appropriate academic supervisor, administrative supervisor, or dean. Following are recommendations regarding th e implementation of these principles: 1. Chairs of all departments will address these issues at a departmental administrative meeting or grand rounds every year. 2. Directors of training and course directors are encouraged to discuss (in a non-threatening format), with faculty and house staff, the etio logy of inappropriate behavior and engage their collaboration in developi ng and implementing improvements. 3. Directors of training and course directors will ask fo r student evaluations of this aspect of their experience as part of their eval uations with every group of students. 4. Faculty and house staff will be advised that while appropriate personal behavior is absolutely necessary, it is insufficient. It is also required that ina ppropriate behavior or language on the part of others must not go without comment. 5. The Dean will issue an adviso ry regarding this policy to all faculty, house staff, and students. New members of the faculty, house staff and student body will be given copies of this advisory. 6. The Executive Curriculum Committee will periodically assess students' experiences to gauge the effectiveness of this initiative. 12.9 Mount Sinai Medical Center Social Media Guideline Social media are internet-based applications, which support and promote the exchange of user- developed content. Some current exam ples include Facebook, Wikipedia, and YouTube. Posting personal images, experiences and information on these kinds of public sites poses a set of unique challenges for all memb ers of the Mount Sinai community, including employees, faculty, housestaff, fellows, volunteers and students (collectiv ely \"Personnel\"). All personnel have responsibility to the institution rega rdless of where or when they post something that may reflect poorly on Mount Sinai. Mount Sinai is committed to supporting your right to interact knowledgeably and socially; however these electronic interac tions have a potential impact on patients, colleagues, Mount Sinai, and future employers' opinions of you. The 136 principal aim of this Guideline is to identify your responsibilities to Mount Sinai in relation to social media and to help you represent yourse lf and Mount Sinai in a responsible and professional manner. The full Guideline may be found in the Faculty Handbook at the following URL: http://www.mssm.edu/about-us/services-a nd-resources/faculty-resources/handbooks-and- policies/faculty-ha ndbook/institutional- policies/social-media-guidelines 12.10 Mount Sinai Policy on Business Conflicts of Interest Mount Sinai Medical Center has an obligation to ensure that its trustees, faculty, employees and other staff adhere to the highe st standards of ethical conduct free from any improper external influence or any appearance of impropriety. S ituations can occur in which an independent observer might reasonably conclude that the potential for individual or institutional conflict could influence the manner in which individuals ca rry out their responsibi lities or the decisions made by the institution. Even in the absence of an actual conflict of interest, such situations may require actions to minimize th e appearance of a conflict. At the same time, Mount Sinai understands that su ch individuals and their close family members may have relationships that could raise perceived or actual conflicts of interest, but could benefit Mount Sinai if carefully exam ined and properly managed. In order to safeguard the integrity of both M ount Sinai and its consti tuents, Mount Sinai has adopted a rigorous conflicts policy predicated on full disclosure and appropriate management of any possible conflict of interest. This Policy on Business Conflicts of In terest (the \"Policy\") identifies those persons or entiti es covered by this Policy, sets out the requirements for disclosing potential business conflicts of interest, and specifies the procedures for reviewing such disclosures and determining what measures, if any, should be institu ted to manage the conflict. This Policy is intended to cover conflicts that arise out of busin ess relationships. Mount Sinai has related policies that c over other types of conflicts, such as Mount Sinai's Policy on Financial Conflicts of Interest in Resear ch and its Policy regarding Financial Relationships with Outside Entities. http://www.mssm.edu/static_files/MSSM/File s/About%20Us/Services %20and%20Resources/Fa culty%20Resources/Handbooks%20and%20Policie s/Business%20COI%20Policy%202010%20a mendments%20v12.pdf 137 13. Student Government The Mount Sinai School of Medici ne Student Council is composed of 20 members: four students from each class and four graduate students ( one of which is from the Genetic Counseling Masters Program). The Student Council consider s all academic, financial, and other matters related to being a student in th e School of Medicine and the Graduate School. At the first meeting in September, the Student Council will el ect a Secretary from the incoming first-year class and no more than four other represen tatives to create the Student Council Steering Committee. At the first meeting in May of each year, after the spring election, the offices of President, Vice-President, and Treasurer will be elected for the following year. This committee meets monthly with the Deans and meets jointl y with the Faculty Council Steering Committee three times per year. As described in the sec tion on Governance, the Steering Committee of the Student Council will oversee the development and a pproval of student budgets related to student activities supported by the Student Activity Fee. A Student Affairs Committee will also be elected from the Stude nt Council Representatives at the first meeting in September. This committee, comprised of five students, one from each class and one graduate student, meets three times each year with the Board of Trustees. The organization of the Student Council, by-l aws, and additional information may be found on the student council website at: http://www.mssm.edu/educatio n/student-resources/student- government/student-council 138 14.

Graduate School Forms All forms referred to in this Handbook can be found on the Mount Sinai Website: http://www.mssm.edu/education/student-res ources/registrar/gra duate-school-forms 142 16. Graduate Faculty Membership The Graduate Faculty consists primarily of tenu red and tenure-track academic faculty (assistant professors, associate professors, and professors ) who have been appointed by the Dean of the Graduate School. The individual must demons trate scholarly productivity, as evidenced by publication of original research, that he or she is competent to teach at the graduate level, is able to conduct independent research in an area rele vant to one of the academic programs of the Graduate School, and, therefore, is qualified to oversee the education and training of a Ph.D. or Master's student. The Graduate Faculty may also include non-tenure track faculty, professional staff, or others with an ongoing professional relationship with MSSM who are willing and qualified to contribute to the institution's gr aduate programs. Such individual s typically have been appointed as research, part-time, visiti ng, or adjunct faculty members, lecturers or instructors. All nominations to the Graduate Faculty must be made by the Program/MTA director using the Recommendation for Graduate Faculty Appointment form and must include a copy of the nominee's CV. Occasionally, specialized expertise from anothe r institution, industry, government, or other sector, could be an asset to a graduate program . Individuals with no formal appointment at MSSM and individuals who do not qualify for fu ll appointment to the graduate faculty may apply for an ad hoc appointment to the graduate facu lty if they are interested in being a part of a graduate student's committee and they have the pot ential to make substantive contributions to that student's education. Ad hoc appointments te rminate with the completion of the particular task for which the appointment was granted. Members of the Graduate Faculty who leave the university may, upon request to the Dean of the Graduate School, remain on the Grad uate Faculty in ad hoc status until all of the students whom they are advising or serving on committees for leave the university. Privileges Members of the Graduate Faculty are eligible to teach graduate courses, serve as a graduate course director, supervise master's students, serv e as examining members or Chairs on master's and PhD advisory and thesis committees, and participate in academic governance of the Graduate School. Length of Appointment Appointment of new members to the Graduate Faculty is for a period of five years. At the end of five years, the member must be nominated a nd reviewed again. A Gr aduate Faculty member who is being considered for continued appointme nt is expected to show evidence of an ongoing research program and/or contribu tions to graduate education. Graduate Faculty status is terminated concurrent with the termination of employment by MSSM. Graduate Faculty may resign their graduate faculty status at any time. 143 Review of Graduate Faculty Members of the Graduate Faculty are expected to show evidence of active involvement in (or, for a beginning faculty member, qualification fo r) graduate student re search supervision, teaching, and service on graduate student advisory and examination committees. When, in a Program or MTA Director's prof essional judgment, a faculty member holding a Graduate Faculty appointment is no longer satisfactorily functioning in this capacity, s/he must recommend to the Dean of the Gr aduate School that the individua l in question be removed from the Graduate Faculty. The Dean of the Graduate School may also initiate the removal process in consultation with the appropriate Program or MTA Director. Graduate Research Mentor for PhD students A Graduate Faculty member who wishes to spon sor a PhD student conducting a thesis project must provide evidence of a research program cap able of providing a stable training environment for the student (in the basic scie nce programs, this typically incl udes support for stipend, health insurance, tuition) before the Program/MTA Director and Dean of the Graduate School can approve the faculty member's role as a dissertation advisor of a PhD student.
