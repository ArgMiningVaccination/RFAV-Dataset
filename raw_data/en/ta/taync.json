The home Epley maneuver is a type of exercise help that helps to treat the symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). You can do this exercise at home. BPPV is caused by a problem in your inner ear. Your semicircular canals are found inside your ear. They detect motion and send this information to your brain. The utricle is a nearby part of the ear. It contains calcium crystals (canaliths) that help it detect movement. Sometimes these crystals detach from the utricle and end up inside the semicircular canals. When these crystals move inside the canals, they may send incorrect signals to your brain about your position. This can make you feel like the world is spinning. This is called vertigo. Dr. John Epley designed a series of movements to dislodge the crystals from the semicircular canals. These movements bring the crystals back to the utricle, where they belong. This treats the symptoms of vertigo. The original Epley maneuver was designed to be done with a healthcare provider. The home Epley maneuver is similar. These are a series of movements that you can do without help, in your own home. Why might I need the home Epley maneuver? You may need to try the home Epley maneuver if you have symptoms of BPPV. In BPPV, vertigo may come on with certain head movements. It may last for up to a minute. These symptoms may be more frequent at times. You may also have nausea and vomiting. Often BPPV happens without any known cause. Sometimes there is a cause. Causes of BPPV can include: - A head injury - Problems after ear surgery The home Epley maneuver is safe and inexpensive. It often works well to treat the symptoms of BPPV. Your healthcare provider may suggest the home Epley maneuver if your health history and physical exam support that you have BBPV.

It may be helpful to have someone at home with you while you go through the movements. This can give you peace of mind in case your vertigo gets worse in the middle of the treatment.
