Ollipop I drank one of these last week and while I was drinking another one today, I decided to Google the ingredients and it turns out many people say they aren't safe for pregnancy. A lot of the herbal ingredients are risky I guess. Has anyone had issues with these? I'm not super concerned because I haven't been drinking them on the reg but am still a little concerned. Thanks!

I've been staying away from almost all herbal things just because there haven't been many studies on the safety of them. So hard to avoid everything though! Drank one last week as well so just googled it too hahah. IDK, there are so many weird/not great ingredients in a lot of foods we humans in general eat...I wouldn't worry about it! It was fine tasting to me but I think I prefer Spindrift! And an occasional Diet Coke - can't imagine Olipop is worse lol, just different \"risks\"/unknowns of the ingredients Bump I wouldn't worry. Pregnant moms prior to the 90s drank and smoke throughout pregnancy. this is a terrible comparison. It does matter. Drinking and smoking led to a ton of health issues. It wasn't harmless. I did the same thing but I had drank 4 or 5 in the course of my pregnancy! I felt so guilty and worried after googling. Everything is all good with me and baby tho :) I've just stopped drinking them since reading up on them! Risky how? I'm curious because on their website it says they are safe for all. I don't see any questionable ingredients. - 1 - 1 You May Also Like [PregnancyYour Pregnancy Week-by-Week](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/week-by-week/) [GeneralLearn About What to Expect's Pregnancy - Sparkling TonicMay 30, 2023 | by alyssammadridI have been drinking these to help my soda craving but never actually stop to think if these are okay for pregnancy...
