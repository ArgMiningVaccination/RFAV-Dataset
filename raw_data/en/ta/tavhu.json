While Western medicine focuses on treating symptoms, Chinese medicine's goal is to treat the root cause of the illness while alleviating accompanying symptoms. An Ancient History Originating in China over 3,000 years ago, acupuncture is the oldest continually practiced medical system in the world. The ancient Chinese recognized the vital energy behind all of life's processes. It is believed that this energy, called \"qi\" (pronounced \"chee\"), circulates throughout the body along meridians or channels. If this energy flow is disrupted, normal physiological function is affected resulting in pain or illness. Cupping Cupping is a practice used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine. It involves creating suction on the skin using a cup made of glass, ceramic, bamboo, or plastic. Negative pressure is created in the cup by applying a flame to the cup to remove air before placing it on the skin. Cupping is used for muscular skeletal issues, fevers, respiratory issues, insomnia and general well-being. Moxibustion Moxibustion is a method of heating specific acupuncture points on the body by burning the herb Artemisia Vulgaris-- known as Moxa-- over the skin. Moxa is used as a stand-alone treatment or sometimes in combination with acupuncture. The herb's properties help to prevent illnesses, strengthen the immune system and its warming nature promotes circulation over areas of chronic pain or muscle tension. Studies have also shown that, when used as an adjunct treatment during chemotherapy, moxibustion can raise the patient's red and white blood cell count and may decrease the negative side effects of allopathic care. Herbs A Doctor of Chinese Medicine can develop a custom herbal prescription that addresses most health complaints to help you restore your health and wellbeing by working as a stand alone therapy or in tandem with acupuncture to support its healing effects. Thousands of years before man-made pharmaceuticals were developed, indigenous peoples used nature's healing substances. For more than 5,000 years, Chinese practitioners developed a system that has codified over 10,000 herbs, many of which form the basis for modern pharmaceutical drugs. Clinically, medicinal herbs are dispensed to each patient as an individual formula based on one's unique constitution, environment, and medical condition. "}
