Physiatrists develop individualized short- and long-term care plans with specific functional goals that are meaningful to the patient and family. Our treatments are designed to help the body heal itself and re-engage in physical activities. Everyone's goals for achieving functional success are different: return to life and sports after traumatic or sports injury, and living a better quality of life with chronic illness and congenital musculoskeletal and neural diseases. We strive to help patients of all functional abilities, medical conditions and backgrounds achieve the highest physical performance level possible. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Services Physiatry is an integrative, nonsurgical medical specialty focused on prevention, diagnosis, rehabilitation and therapy for patients who have functional limitations resulting from injury, disease or malformation. Our physicians are muscle, nerve and bone experts who focus treatment efforts on restoring physical function. A physiatrist leads a multidisciplinary team of medical professionals to treat the whole person, not just the affected area of the body. Our doctors also have different subspecialties in Sports Medicine, Traumatic Brain Injury, Neuromuscular Medicine, Cancer Rehabilitation, Integrative Medicine, Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine and Pain Medicine to address unique needs of their patients.

Safety precautions are also taught to prevent further injury or complications. Whether you are an active person in the community or elite athlete, younger or older, we use a unique approach to finding the right answers to your sports- and exercise-related injuries or pain.
