Results.2 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015Message from the Deputy Director Sincerely, Ed Wallace, Deputy Director Iowa Workforce Development This year marks the ninth edition of Iowa's Workforce and the Economy , and this publication is certainly one full of encouraging news. A brief overview of 2014 highlights the many advances the state economy experienced over the past year: a steadily advancing nonfarm employment and labor force coupled with a shrinking unemployment rate, and an upward trend in several economic indicators, such as housing and new vehicle sales, a gain in personal income, and a sharp increase in exports. Many of the following articles contained herein highlight the advancements the state has achieved in 2014. The article Recession and Recovery in the Construction Industry details just how prosperous this sector has been over the past few years. While Employment Outcomes of Recent Iowa Community College Graduates illustrates just how important our community colleges have been in preparing our workers for the dynamic and ever-changing work place. Iowa's higher-education institutions will become increasingly vital as the state addresses our aging workforce, and these programs, along with recent science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) initiatives, should help ensure our Iowa labor force remains employable and ready to address the changing demands from employers. Lastly, this publication contains highlights of the major business expansions and renovations planned across the state by region. These initiatives help ensure that Iowa's economy will remain prosperous for the foreseeable future. 3 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 20152015Iowa's Workforce and the Economy Labor Market Information Division 1000 East Grand Avenue, Des Moines, IA 50319-0209 For deaf hard of hearing, use Relay 711 (800) 831-13994 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 20155 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015TABLE OF CONTENTS Executive Summary ....................................................................... page 6 Overview of the 2014 Iowa Economy ......................................... page 9 State and Local Labor Force Trends .......................................... page 12 Iowa's Nonfarm Employment Trends ......................................... page 15 Iowa's Occupational Projections: 2012-2022 ......................... page 18 Recession and Recovery in the Construction Industry ............ page 21 Employment Outcomes of Recent Iowa Community College Graduates ....................................... page 24 Using the Analyst Resource Center Database ......................... page 28 Incentive Awards by IWD Region - 2014 ................................... page 306 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015 The Iowa economy continued to advance in 2014. Most indices reflected expansion and confidence in the economic climate. The labor force reached an all-time high in 2014, exports expanded following a slight contraction in 2013, and the level of unemployed dropped to its lowest level since 2008. Iowa's exports expanded by $1.2 billion; construction employment surged due to steady, moderate demand from residential homebuyers coupled with several large-scale industrial projects around the state; and new vehicle registrations advanced slightly. This was the fourth consecutive year of growth in nonfarm employment. Job gains were heaviest in metropolitan areas. Personal income increased by 1.4 percent, down slightly from the gain over the last couple of years. Per capita personal income also correspondingly advanced in 2014, climbing to $45,115 from $44,763 in 2013. Early forecasts suggested 2015 could be more prosperous for the Iowa economy; however, recent developments suggest that bullish gross domestic product projections might need to be lowered somewhat. Even with that in mind, most sectors are expected to add jobs or maintain current levels through the end of 2015. Iowa's statewide annual average unemployment rate dropped to 4.3 percent in 2014 from 4.7 percent in 2013. At the same time, the U.S. rate for unemployment also improved, dropping to 6.2 percent in 2014 from 7.4 percent in 2013. Iowa and Hawaii tied for the ninth-lowest unemployment rate in the nation. The number of unemployed persons in Iowa averaged 74,000 in 2014, down from 78,200 in 2013. Men accounted for 60 percent of the unemployed in Iowa in 2014, compared to women who made up 40 percent. Minorities and youth continued to experience the highest rates of unemployment: Blacks or African Americans (14.1 percent), youth 16 to 19 years of age (12.0 percent), and Hispanics (8.5 percent). Workers with less education also continued to experience a higher unemployment rate than better educated individuals: those with less than a high school diploma (10.9 percent), high school graduates with no college (5.8 percent), those with some college or associate's degree (4.6 percent), and those with a Bachelor's degree or higher (2.1 percent). Iowa's long term unemployment also eased somewhat in 2014, down to 18.8 percent of total unemployment from 21.1 percent in 2013. Unemployment rates in all nine of the state's metropolitan statistical areas (MSA's) and most rural counties decreased in 2014. The Ames MSA experienced the lowest rate of the nine major labor market areas at 2.9 percent; Davenport-Moline-Rock Island MSA was the highest at 6.3 percent. Jobless rates for Iowa's 99 counties ranged from a low of 2.6 percent in Lyon to a high of 6.3 percent in Lee. Iowa's economy continued to expand through 2014, ending the year at a record level of nonfarm employment. This is the fourth consecutive year of employment gains. However, compared to surrounding states in 2014, four of the six states had higher rates of growth than Iowa's (1.3 percent). The United States as a whole had a growth rate of 1.9 percent. The gap between Iowa's rate of growth and that of the country has increasingly widened over the past four years, with the nation's rate of growth exceeding Iowa's each year. The overwhelming majority of the state's super-sectors experienced gains in nonfarm EXECUTIVE SUMMARY7 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015EXECUTIVE SUMMARYemployment from 2013 to 2014. The only sectors with job losses were private education which lost 800 jobs, information, which lost 500, and mining and logging, down 100. The information sector is down 8,000 jobs (23.8 percent) from its peak of 33,600 in 2007 as new technology and information delivery systems continue to play a role in the reduction of the sector's employment. Strong employment gains occurred in construction and professional and business services from 2013 to 2014. Manufacturing also added jobs each of the last four years, although the rate of gain has steadily slowed each year. Other economic indicators show mixed results. Corn and soybean profits fell sharply through 2014, leading many to believe 2015 will be a challenging year for farmers. Home sales in Iowa remained fairly steady from 2013 to 2014 with just 0.4 percent fewer sales in 2014. The average sale price of homes increased 1.3 percent from 2013 to 2014, up to $157,385. The 2012-2022 Iowa Occupational Projections show employment changes over the next decade. Steady incremental growth best describes the projections during this period. Iowa is projected to have 11.2 percent cumulative growth (or 1.1 percent annual growth) across all occupational groups. This represents an increase in employment from 1,758,205 in 2012 to 1,955,480 in 2022. The largest growth rates in the major occupational groups are expected in Construction and Extraction, Computer and Mathematical, Personal Care and Service, Healthcare (Support and Practitioner), and Community and Social Service. In terms of number of jobs, the largest anticipated increases are Office and Administrative, Sales, Transportation and Material Moving, Construction and Extraction, Healthcare Practitioner, Food Preparation and Production. The Iowa occupations with the fastest growth rate over the next decade are expected to be interpreters/translators, medical sonographers, occupational therapy assistants, information security analysts, insulation workers, meeting/convention planners, actuaries, physical therapist assistants, personal care aides, and postsecondary health teachers. The occupations with the largest growth in number of jobs are expected to be truck drivers, registered nurses, food prep/serving workers, retail salespersons, customer service reps, laborers/ material movers, childcare workers, home health aides, janitors and cleaners, and cashiers. The construction sector of Iowa's economy consists of 74,263 private-sector employees and almost 1,500 public sector employees. It is the 7th largest sector of Iowa's economy and represents about 5.8 percent of Iowa's total private-sector employment. Average annual income for construction workers in Iowa was $51,937, about 25 percent higher than the average private sector employee's wage of $41,965. The economic downturn from 2008 to 2010 was especially hard on the construction sector in Iowa. While the state's economy as a whole dropped by 4.3 percent during this period, the construction sector dropped by 15.7 percent. This large gap meant that it took longer for the construction sector to recover. Although the number of jobs statewide surpassed their pre-recession high in 2013, it took the construction sector until 2014 to return to 2008 levels. Since 2011, however, construction has been making a strong comeback. The number of construction jobs in Iowa increased by nearly 10 percent between 2013 and 2014, while the entire state economy grew by less than 1.5 percent. In September 2014, the Iowa Department of Education released the Iowa Community Colleges Education Outcomes: Diploma, Certificate, and Associate Degree Programs report. It represents the most comprehensive and detailed publicly available employment data 8 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015for Iowa community college graduates to date. The purpose of the report is to describe employment and wage outcomes of Iowa community college graduates. Employment and wages are only analyzed for those graduates that have not enrolled in further education, since the earnings for enrolled students could be attributed to additional education. Nine of the ten highest earning programs are AAS (Associate of Applied Science) degrees. The only non-AAS program in the top ten is the lineworker diploma program. Seven of the top ten programs are mechanical, engineering, or production- related. These programs prepare students for jobs in many industries, but primarily in manufacturing, construction and utilities. Two of the top ten are nursing programs and the final one is a multi-disciplinary degree customized by either students or employers. One of the responsibilities of Iowa Workforce Development (IWD) is to provide employment services to our customers. For over fifteen years, the Analyst Resource Center (ARC) Employer Database has assisted job seekers with information about employers: who they are, where they are, and how they can be contacted. Job openings are not included in the ARC Employer Database. It is an acquired database that contains information on over fifteen million employers throughout the country. The database has several levels of access to data: licensee, intermediate user, and end user. The IWD website provides end user access only. The end user, e.g. a job seeker, is able to search a defined area of the database and receive a display of partial records, including firm name, address, internet address, phone number and contact, business description, and size. Each year, the Iowa Department of Economic Development, receives requests for and grants the Iowa Economic Development Authority (IEDA) Incentive Awards. In 2014, IEDA Awards were granted in the form of tax incentives and direct financial assistance to new and established businesses. The awards are expected to directly and indirectly result in the creation of numerous jobs throughout Iowa. Presented in this publication are examples of those awards broken out by Iowa Workforce Development region.9 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015OVERVIEW OF THE 2014 IOWA ECONOMY Record Highs Reached in 2014 The Iowa economy continued to advance in 2014, even surpassing records in labor force and nonfarm employment. Most indices reflected expansion over the past year and confidence in the economic climate; the labor force reached an all-time high in 2014, exports expanded following a slight contraction in 2013, and the level of unemployed dropped to its lowest level since 2008. Early evidence suggests this trend should continue through 2015. While 2013 was prosperous by most measures, it was partially hindered by global uncertainty and partisan budget skirmishes; 2014 was not affected by the same afflictions. Iowa's exports expanded by $1.2 billion (+8.6 percent), construction employment surged (+6,600 jobs or 9.7 percent) due to steady, moderate demand from residential homebuyers coupled with several large-scale industrial projects around the state, and new vehicle registrations advanced slightly to 142,431 new units registered (+0.4 percent). Nationally, nonfarm employment added 2.6 million jobs in 2014, a gain of 1.9 percent annually. This was the most jobs gained and fastest pace since 2000. Although positive, Iowa's annual growth rate fell short of the national level (1.3 percent), but did match last year's level. Additionally, this was the fourth-consecutive year of growth in nonfarm employment. Job gains were heaviest in metropolitan areas (71.2 percent urban versus 28.8 percent rural), despite Iowa's large rural working population (56.4 percent). Non-metro employment advanced by just 5,700 jobs in 2014\u2014a gain of 0.9 percent. However, this sluggish growth may simply be a symptom of migration and commuting patterns towards metropolitan areas that has been increasing over the past several decades. The metropolitan areas which experienced the fastest rate of expansion in 2014 were Des Moines (+8,200) and Ames (+1,800). Both added jobs annually at a much faster pace than the state (+2.4 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively). Iowa City and Sioux City gained jobs at nearly the same pace as the state (1.4 and 1.3 percent, respectively), while Dubuque, Cedar Rapids, and Waterloo experienced slower-than-average expansions during the past year but still increased annually. Most of the indicators trended up, and in most cases, gained momentum in 2014. Notable highlights for last year include: Iowa's housing market remained strong in 2014. According to the Iowa Association of Realtors, the State's average home sales price expanded by $2,063 (+1.3 percent) to $157,385. Although positive, the pace is down compared to 2013, when the average home sales price increased by $7,733 (+5.2 percent). The average number of days on the market shrank slightly to an average of 86 days. Construction employment surged in 2014 (+9.7 percent); however, a majority of that advancement stemmed from industrial, institutional, and business projects. While the number of residential housing projects undertaken has been stagnant versus last year, rising prices coupled with decreasing days on the market and historically low interest rates should bode well for 2015 and provide strong evidence of increasing demand among homebuyers.10 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015 New vehicle registrations rose slightly (+0.4 percent) to 142,431, continuing a streak started in 2009. Like housing, the auto industry also benefited from historically low interest rates and should also be buoyed by easing consumer spending in 2015. Unfortunately, U.S. automakers sales decreased in Iowa in 2014 (-1.4 percent); all of the annual growth in vehicle registrations were from gains in foreign vehicle sales (+4.0 percent). While purchases were stagnant for cars and trucks, multi-purpose vehicle sales (SUVs, minivans, and other all-terrain vehicles) were strong in 2014\u2014up 4,295. Personal income increased by 1.4 percent. Although positive, this rate is down from the 3.1 percent average gain over last couple years, and markedly below the 9.2 increase in the rebound year of 2011 following the recession. The per capita personal income also correspondingly advanced last year, climbing to $45,115 from $44,763 in 2013. Iowa ranked 25th in terms of per capita income compared with other states, yet 49th in terms of annual growth with only Nebraska trailing (0.5 percent growth). Iowa's total employment expanded by 35,000 jobs in 2014, the second-consecutive year for growth. The state's labor force also increased, gaining 30,900 participants. These gains marked all-time highs in employment and labor force, eclipsing prior records established in 2008. The 2014 unemployment rate of 4.4 percent is the lowest annual rate since 4.3 percent established in pre-recession 2008. Unemployment insurance benefits paid and average duration continued to trend downward in the wake of the recession. The total weeks compensated for unemployment insurance decreased by 7.2 percent versus 2013. Average duration of benefits dipped to 12.9 weeks from 13.7 in 2013. These levels peaked for Iowa in 2009 when the average duration of benefits were 15.6 weeks paid and 2.6 million weeks were compensated\u2014over twice the amount paid in 2014. Recent benefit amounts now trend near pre-recession levels. Iowa exports increased by $1.2 billion to $15.1 billion following a small decline in 2013. Absent many of the austerity measures which partially hampered foreign trade in 2013, the 2014 values expanded with the largest gains being in cereals, meat and edible offal, oil seeds and grains, and residues and by-products from the food industry. Cereals comprise 5.8 percent of total export revenue for the state and doubled following a weak showing in 2013. Industrial machinery makes up the largest component of Iowa exports (17.8 percent) but has declined the last few years from 21.3 percent in 2012.4102 3102 2102 1102 0102 rotacidnI 402.6Iowa Economic Indicator s Source: N/A11 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015Planning Ahead for a Strong Iowa Workforce As the economy continued expanding this past year, several initiatives were undertaken to help insure that Iowa's workforce remains adequately prepared for future opportunities that accompany increased demand for a skilled workforce. Iowa's Apprenticeship and Job Training Act, signed in May 2014 by Governor Terry Branstad, was passed to help train a skilled workforce and help meet demand from businesses looking to expand in Iowa. This program should help train younger workers to fill middle-skill occupations while alleviating the need for student debt. Lt. Governor Kim Reynolds announced a combined effort to increase Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education and mentoring of Iowa's young girls and women. This initiative is designed to emphasize the importance and opportunities available in the future Iowa workforce. Recent projections completed by Iowa Workforce Development show that from 2012-2022 several STEM and middle-skill occupational groups are expected to grow faster than the projected statewide growth rate of 1.1 percent. Efforts to bring technological firms into Iowa should bolster the demand for STEM and middle-skill workers as workplaces become more technologically-driven as opposed to labor-intensive. 2015 Economic Climate While early forecasts suggested that 2015 was going to be a more prosperous year for the Iowa economy, recent developments have suggested that bullish gross domestic product projections might need to be lowered somewhat. Last year, the nation felt the effects of austerity within foreign markets and global uncertainty of a recession; 2015 has already dealt with particularly harsh winter in the country's northeast (one that likely shed a few percentage points off first quarter gross domestic product) coupled with an increasingly overvalued dollar throttling demand for increasingly expensive American exports. In other parts of the country, rapidly decreasing oil prices may soon have a real impact on oil and gas production jobs and the related manufacturing that goes along with extraction machinery. Many of these national \"shocks\" to the economy will have a mitigated impact on the 2015 Iowa economy. Reduced oil prices will generally increase Iowans' disposable income, while diminished demand for domestic fuel extraction and equipment is not a factor as oil and gas production and related activities have little to no presence in the state. The Iowa economy began 2015 on a positive note, adding jobs in every month through March, while the unemployment rate steadily trended down. Most sectors have also advanced and are expected to add jobs or maintain current levels through the end of the year. References: Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce.

Iowa and U.S. Unemployment Rates, 2010-2014 Source: Labor Market Information Division, Iowa Workforce Development, in cooperation with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor The number of unemployed persons in the state averaged 74,000 in 2014, down from the prior year's 78,200. Men accounted for 60 percent of the unemployed while only 40 percent of the unemployed were women. Minorities and youth continued to experience the highest rates of unemployment: youth, 16 to 19 years (12.0 percent), Black or African American (14.1 percent) and Hispanic (8.5 percent). Characteristics of the unemployed also showed that long-term unemployment (27 weeks or longer) eased somewhat in 2014, representing 18.8 percent of the total compared to 21.1 percent in 2013. Workers with less education continued to experience a higher unemployment rate than more educated members of the labor force: those with less than a high school diploma (10.9 percent), high school graduates with no college (5.8 percent), some college or associate's degree (4.6 percent) and Bachelor's degree and higher (2.1 percent). Unemployment Rates Improve in All Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and Counties Unemployment rates in all nine of the state's metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and most rural counties improved in 2014. On average, the jobless rates for the metropolitan areas decreased by four tenths of a percentage point from 2013. The Ames MSA was the lowest of the nine major labor market areas at 2.9 percent.

At the same time, new and revised labor area definitions took effect for the states. Since the last program improvements were made in 2005, some issues have been identified that affect the 14 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015accuracy and analysis of the estimates. BLS is committed to producing high-quality data and continually conducts research to improve its methods and procedures. Moreover, when data sources cease to exist, new sources must be found to replace them. For example, the LAUS methodology has incorporated data from the long form (decennial census) for years. Since U.S. Census information is no longer being collected on the long form, BLS will be using the American Community Survey (ACS) as an alternate source. Data for the national unemployment rate are obtained directly from the Current Population Survey (CPS), a monthly survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The CPS sample consists of approximately 60,000 households, of which over 700 households are in Iowa. State CPS samples are not large enough to directly produce statistically significant monthly estimates. Instead, BLS has developed statistical models for all states that primarily use the monthly CPS survey results along with nonfarm employment estimates for the state developed from the Current Employment Statistics (CES) program and Iowa Workforce Development records on Unemployment Insurance (UI) claims. The use of time series models dates back to 1989, when estimates for 39 states (Iowa included) and the District of Columbia became based on models developed by BLS and tested by state employment security agencies. LAUS redesign for State models occurred in 2005 with the introduction of the third generation of LAUS models. In 2015, a fourth-generation model was implemented that added further improvements to the monthly employment and unemployment estimates, including a historical series back to 1976 for the State. There are four main differences between the 2005 and 2015 models: (1) structural differences, (2) real-time benchmarking, (3) smoothed seasonal adjustment, and (4) treatment of outliers (extreme values in a particular month). Both the 2005 and 2015 state models are signal-plus-noise models. The 2015 models, or fourth-generation models, move from the bivariate structure to a regressor format. Nonfarm employment from the CES program and unemployment insurance claims are used as regressor variables, rather than separate input variables. This feature allows greater flexibility for the treatment of outliers and for long-term model development. In the 2005 generation of the models, real-time benchmarking was an external process applied after the completion of model estimation. With the fourth-generation model, real-time benchmarking is now a model-based component of the estimation procedure, distributing the benchmark discrepancy to the states where it is most appropriate. The states that contributed more to the discrepancy will receive a larger adjustment. The new, fourth-generation models will utilize an improved smoothed seasonal-adjustment filter. In addition to the trend filter, weights have been added to create a seasonal filter. In the 2005 or third-generation models, state outliers were added to the model prior to real- time benchmarking. With the 2015 models, outliers will be added subsequent to real-time benchmarking. This approach allows the preservation of the impact of the outlier in the originating state and prevents the distortion of estimates in other states. 15 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015IOWA'S NONFARM EMPLOYMENT TRENDS The Year at a Glance Iowa's economy continued to expand through 2014, ending the year at record level nonfarm employment with an annual average of 1,547,900 jobs. This is the fourth consecutive year of employment gains following the latest recession. Compared to surrounding states, Iowa's rate of growth was slightly above average in 2014 and has been for the past four years. However, in 2014, four of the six surrounding states experienced a greater rate of growth than Iowa, making Iowa's growth rate fifth among seven states. The previous year, Iowa's growth rate was second among Iowa and surrounding states. The growth rate of the United States as a whole (1.9 percent) eclipsed that of all Midwest states, with Minnesota enjoying the greatest gain at 1.4 percent. The Minnesota growth rate was closely followed by South Dakota (1.4 percent), Nebraska (1.3 percent), Wisconsin (1.3 percent), Iowa (1.3 percent), Illinois (1.1 percent), and Missouri (0.9 percent). Over the past several years, Iowa's rate of employment change tracked closely with that of the nation with few exceptions. In 2014, Iowa's statewide rate of growth for nonfarm employment (1.3 percent) was below that of the United States (1.9 percent). The gap between Iowa and the United States has increasingly widened over the past four years. Nonfarm Employment Industry Movement The overwhelming majority of the state's super-sectors experienced gains in nonfarm employment from 2013 to 2014. The only sectors with job losses were private education, which lost 800 jobs, information, which was down 500, and mining and logging, down 100.

The information sector is down 8,000 jobs (23.8 percent) from its peak of 33,600 achieved in 2007 as new technology and information delivery systems continue to play a role in the reduction of the sector's employment. Strong employment gains occurred in construction and professional and business services from 2013 to 2014. Construction has added 6,600 jobs (9.8 percent) and the professional and business services sector has gained 3,800 jobs (2.9 percent). Manufacturing also has added jobs each of the last four years, although the rate of gain has steadily slowed over each year (2.6 percent from 2010-2011, 1.1 percent from 2013-2014). Employment in educational and health services has increased each of the last four years at a steadily decreasing rate. Health services employment has remained fairly steady and averaged a 1.5 percent four-year gain, while educational services has averaged a 1.1 percent decrease over four years. Growth in financial activities increased 0.5 percent from 2013-2014. While still gaining employment, this rate of gain is significantly lower than the 2.0 percent gain realized from 2012-2013. Other Economic Indicators Grain profits fell sharply through 2014, leading many to believe 2015 will be a challenging year for farmers. The average profit per bushel of corn (for grain) dropped 66.2 percent from 2013 to 2014 and, with exception of a small gain in December, has declined each month since June 2013. Profits from soybeans have suffered a similar setback, although there was a hint of a comeback mid-year before continuing to decline. The Iowa Department of Revenue reported the change in average profits from 2013 to 2014 was 27.9 percent.

The sale price of homes increased 1.3 percent from 2013 with a 2014 average sale price of $157,385. The year ended on a positive note, with home sales for the month of December up 4.8 percent from the previous year and pending sales up 8.2 percent. When combined with the current low home mortgage interest rates, this end-of-year boost bodes well for a solid start in 2015.4090140190240290 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov DecCents per Bush el 2014 2013Figure 4: Corn Profits 2013 - 2014 Source: Iowa Department of Revenue18 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015IOWA'S OCCUPATIONAL PROJECTIONS - 2012-2022 The 2012-2022 State of Iowa long-term occupational projections provides the basis for many forms of labor market analysis. With hundreds of occupations under review, many varying types of reports have been made to capture, categorize, and create an understanding of the data. This article will provide an occupational analysis and the publications from which they come. Occupational Group Projections Steady incremental growth best describes the 2012-2022 State of Iowa occupational projections. During this period, Iowa is projected to have an 11.2 percent growth (or 1.1% annual) across all occupational groups. Numerically, this translates from Iowa's initial 2012 total employment estimate of 1,758,205 to a projected 1,955,480 count for 2022. Figure 1 provides the projections data by growth rate and Figure 2 by employment change. Construction, Computer and Mathematical, Personal Care, Healthcare (Support, Practitioner), and Social Services are among the leading occupational groups by growth rate. In terms of employment change, Office and Administrative, Sales, Transportation, Construction, Healthcare Practitioner, Food Preparation, and Production lead the way.

The top ten occupations include Interpreters, Medical Sonographers, Occupational Therapy Assistants, Information Security Analysts, Insulation Workers, Meeting and Convention Planners, Actuaries, Physical Therapist Assistants, Personal Care Aides, and Postsecondary Health Teachers. Iowa's top ten occupations expected to have the largest employment growth for 2012-2022 will account for 44,705 (or 23%) of the projected 197,275 new jobs. The major occupational groups of Healthcare, Food Service, Sales, Office and Administrative Support, and Transportation and Material Moving will account for 33,395 (or 75%) of the 44,705 new jobs as shown in Figure 4. Truck Drivers, Registered Nurses, Food Preparation Workers, Retail Salespersons, Customer Service Reps, Laborers/Material Movers, Childcare Workers, Home Health Aides, Janitors/Cleaners, and Cashiers are projected to be Iowa's top ten leading occupations in employment growth. Iowa's Hot Jobs and STEM Jobs The 2012-2022 occupational projections serve as the basis for both Iowa's Hot Jobs and STEM Jobs . Hot Jobs examine an occupation's rate of growth and rate of pay and must be higher than the state average for all occupations in both annual growth and salary. STEM Jobs refer to occupations heavily dependent on acquiring tools and skills from Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). These occupations can be found predominantly in Computer and Mathematical; Architecture and Engineering; Life, Physical, and Social Science; and Healthcare (Practitioner and Support) occupational groups. 3.6%3.7%3.8%3.9%3.9%4.2%4.4%4.4%4.4%4.8% 3: 2012-2022 Iowa Occupations with Fastest Growth Rate Figure 4: 2012-2022 Iowa Occupations with Largest Growth 3,3503,3553,4153,5003,5554,1854,6605,0205,6358,030 CashiersJanitors and 2.1 61.51 127,947 Health Specialties Teachers, Postsecondary* 1,825 2,480 Actuaries* 540 Physician Assistants* 725 955 3.2 43.31 90,094 Real Estate Brokers 680 840 2.4 41.88 87,111 Nurse Practitioners* 720 920 2,425 3,190 25.86 53,790 Nutritionists* 25.27 52,570 Iron & Steel Wkrs 855 1,050 2.3 25.15 52,309 Fundraisers 460 550 2.1 25.03 52,056 Occupational Therapy 520 47,339 Medical Equipment Repairers & Event Planners 435 605 3.9 22.04 45,839 Millwrights 6,150 43,340 Industrial Machinery Mechanics Sales Agents 1,570 1,910 2.2 20.24 Mental Health & Wkrs 1,625 1,95 0 2.0 19.63 40,839 2.3 19.53 40,632 Science 2.4 Substance Wage2014 Mean SalaryFigure 5: 2012-2022 Iowa Hot Jobs and STEM JobsFigure 5 provides a listing of Iowa's top fifty Hot Jobs, including occupations that are also considered STEM (indicated with an *).

Source: Occupational Projections, Labor Market Information Division, Iowa Workforce Development21 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015RECESSION AND RECOVERY IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY Since the \"Great Recession\" peaked in 2008, the construction industry has been under the spotlight, because the downturn began, in part, when the housing bubble burst. As one would expect, in the state of Iowa construction was hit significantly harder and employment dropped faster than the average Iowa industry. This industry has also experienced a robust recovery, and the ground lost has been regained over the past few years. Surprisingly, while all subsectors of the industry took a hit and bounced back during and after the recession, non-residential construction employment lost proportionally more jobs, but has boomed in the post-recession years. Construction Defined The construction sector is made up of establishments that erect buildings or engineering projects such as utility systems and highways. Firms that build or repair structures as well as firms that prepare sites for new construction are included in this sector. Construction work can include work additions, alterations, and repairs. There are three subsectors that make up this sector. The first is the construction of buildings which consists of constructing or remodeling both residential and industrial buildings. The second subsector is heavy and civil engineering construction. This subsector consists of establishments that work on engineering projects\u2014like highways, bridges, and dams\u2014either completing entire projects or working on specific components of such projects. The third subsector of construction is specialty trade contractors. These establishments preform specific activities related to construction work, for example HVAC or painting, but are not responsible for entire construction projects. Figure 1: Employment and Wage Trends Before the Recession, at Their Recession Low, and in 2014 Source: Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, Labor Market Information Division, Iowa Workforce Development The employment numbers are calculated by averaging the employment for the four quarters of each year. The average annual wage is the total wages paid for that year divided by the annual employment.ID NO.

This sector represents about 5.8 percent of Iowa's total private-sector employment, making it the 7th largest sector of Iowa's economy. The average annual income for construction sector workers in Iowa was $51,937 a year, nearly 25 percent higher than the average private sector employee's wage of $41,965 per year. The largest sub sector is specialty trade contractors, representing 46,944 employees. This sector, although the lowest paid of the three sectors, boasts a respectable average annual salary of $49,058. Building construction consists of 16,417 employees whose annual wage was $51,857 for 2014. Heavy and civil engineering construction is the most generously compensated subsector in this industry, averaging $64,456 a year in 2014. This subsector consists of 10,903 employees. Recession and Recovery The economic downturn that lasted from about 2008 to 2010 was especially hard on the construction sector. While the state's economy as a whole shrunk by 4.3 percent between 2008 and 2010 (the year at which employment reached its lowest point), the construction sector shed 15.7 percent of its employment over the same period. It also took the construction sector in this state longer to recover than it took the aggregate economy. While the number of jobs statewide surpassed their pre-recession high in 2013, the construction sector took until 2014 to return to 2008 employment levels. Despite the big hit the construction sector took during the recession, the sector looks destined for a strong comeback. Since 2011, the sector has been adding jobs faster than the state's economy as a whole and the number of construction jobs in Iowa increased by nearly 10 percent between 2013 and 2014, while the entire state economy grew by less than 1.5 percent. If the trend continues, we should experience a return to pre-recession employment peaks by the end of 2015. Residential and Non-Residential Growth Patterns The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program data divide most subsectors into residential and non-residential. To examine the effects of the housing crash on construction employment, all residential construction industries were summed, and nonresidential construction was inferred by subtracting residential from total construction. The crash of the housing market played a large role in the recent recession. Therefore, it may not be surprising to learn that construction took a larger hit than other sectors in All Construction Employment Residential Construction Employment Non-Residential Construction EmploymentFigure 2 Year over Year Changes in Construction Employment Source: Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, Labor Market Information Division, Iowa Workforce Development Plot points are Year 2 divided by year 1, so values below one indicate that the sector shrank over the past year and values greater than one indicate growth.23 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015However, residential construction was a lesser factor of the steep decline in construction employment. While residential construction constricted by a substantial 10.4 percent between 2008 and 2010, non-residential construction dropped a staggering 18.4 percent over the same period. Furthermore, residential construction in Iowa had not grown for years before the recession and did not start adding jobs until 2011, so the construction slump was not a catalyst of the mortgage crisis in Iowa. The phenomenal growth in construction jobs since 2010 is also not attributable to a housing boom. While the number of jobs in residential construction grew a respectable 10 percent between the low-point of the recession in 2010 and 2014, non-residential jobs rocketed up an impressive 21 percent over the same period. Construction is an important industry in the state of Iowa, but sector increases depends on growth in other areas. In recent years, construction has expanded as industrial and commercial employment has increased, with residential construction as a secondary source of job creation. This dependency on other areas of the economy implies that construction may be especially hurt in recessions, but can be a source for great growth as the economy recovers. 24 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES OF RECENT IOWA COMMUNITY COLLEGE GRADUATES Since the turn of the century, it has become progressively inexpensive to store large amounts of data. This abundance of accessible data has also brought around an increased focus on data-based decision making in both the public and private sectors, fundamentally changing the way organizations\u2014from professional sports franchises to Wall Street\u2014are managed. This push has not left the education industry behind. In 2005, the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) started awarding competitive federal grants to states under the Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems (SLDS) Grant Program. These grants assisted states in developing and expanding the infrastructure of their state educational data systems. One goal of these grants is to connect postsecondary education records with state Unemployment Insurance (UI) wage records in order to track the employment outcomes of college graduates. The demand for, and availability of, data on the earnings of recent college graduates has increased markedly over the past five years. One of the primary drivers behind the demand is the growing student debt load and the need to quantify students' abilities to pay it down. Many states have started to make that data publicly accessible via the internet. College Measures' Economic Success Metrics (ESM) Program (collegemeasures.org/esm) is one example of a website doing just that. Six participating states have published employment rates and earnings data for college graduates by program and by postsecondary institution. In September 2014, the Iowa Department of Education released the Iowa Community Colleges Education Outcomes: Diploma, Certificate and Associate Degree Programs report. This report was a cooperative venture with Iowa Workforce Development and analyzes the employment and wage outcomes of recent Iowa community college graduates by award type and by program. It represents the most comprehensive and detailed publicly available employment data for Iowa community college graduates to date. Iowa Community College Award Types Community colleges offer a much more diverse selection of awards than the majority of four- year institutions. Therefore, one should gain an understanding of the differences in these awards' purposes before attempting to analyze the employment outcomes of those graduates that receive them. Most people are familiar with the associate degree -- an award designed to take two years of full-time study to attain. What many do not realize is that there are several varieties of associate degrees offered by Iowa community colleges, and their purposes vary greatly. Figure 1 illustrates a very simplified breakdown of these differing intents. Some associate degrees (i.e. Associate of Arts (AA), Associate of Science (AS)) are designed for the student planning to transfer to a four year program upon completion. Other associate degrees (i.e. Associate 25 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015of Applied Science (AAS), Associate of Applied Arts (AAA)) are based on career and technical education (CTE) programs designed to prepare students for entry-level employment in technical occupations. The Associate of General Studies (AGS) degree is pictured outside of these two circles because the course of study is constructed by the individual student who can customize his or her individual program of study. Beyond associate degrees, Iowa community colleges also offer diplomas and certificates which are awarded upon completion of shorter programs; program length varies greatly, but is intended to be no more than one year of full-time study. These are also based on CTE programs that prepare students for employment. Where do Iowa community college graduates end up? The Iowa Community Colleges Education Outcomes: Diploma, Certificate and Associate Degree Programs report does not only include employment and wage data. One of its other sections which can be analyzed is student migration. Figure 2 summarizes what Iowa community college graduates from state fiscal years 2010 to 2012 (FY2010 - FY2012) were doing in the first year after receiving their award. For the purposes of the report, if a student was both enrolled in further education and working, they are counted as attending college. There were 43,398 awardees between FY2010 and FY2012, 86.3 percent of which were in either Iowa postsecondary education or Iowa employment in the first year after receiving their award. Of the 22,732 awardees that were enrolled in further education in Iowa (52.4% of the entire cohort), slightly over two thirds (68.1%) of them were still enrolled at an Iowa community college. The remaining 31.9 percent transferred to an in-state four year institution. Of all the awardees, only 9.2 percent left the state of Iowa for either further education or employment in the first year after graduation. Iowa community college graduates tend to migrate out of the state in aggregate at a relatively slow rate, so this number will rise as the time since graduation increases. This pattern is illustrated in the 2011 Iowa Statewide Community College Economic Impact Report, a collaborative report between the Iowa Association of Community College Trustees, Iowa Workforce Development and the Iowa Department of Education. Of those students that did leave Iowa in the first year after graduation, just over three-fifths (62.1%) enrolled in further education while almost two-fifths (37.9%) entered the workforce. All of this further education and employment data comes from matching the Iowa community college graduate records to National Student Clearinghouse records (for further education) Figure 1: Summary of Iowa Community College Awards and Their Intent * Many of Iowa's AAS programs are transferable to baccalaureate programs via institutional articulation agreements26 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015and Unemployment Insurance wage records (for employment). Of the 43,398 awardees, 4.5 percent of them were not found in either source and therefore cannot be accounted for. Employment Outcomes by Program The primary purpose of the Iowa Community Colleges Education Outcomes: Diploma, Certificate and Associate Degree Programs report is to describe employment and wage outcomes of Iowa community college graduates. Employment and wages are only analyzed for those graduates that have not enrolled in further education, as the earnings for enrolled students could be attributed to that additional education. Figure 3 shows the top ten awards by earnings in the first year after graduation (median) for fiscal year 2012 awardees. The programs included are limited to those that had at least 25 employed graduates. The biggest takeaway from this table is that nine of the ten highest earning programs are AAS degrees. This pattern is shown in the overall data as well. The overall median first year earnings for fiscal year 2012 AAS recipients was $30,379. The awards with the next highest median earnings were diploma with $22,770 and Associate of Science/Career Option with $22,230 (the latter is an award type that is being phased out in Iowa). Students receiving awards that are intended for transfer that directly enter employment instead of transferring tend to earn lower wages than students in CTE programs ($19,077 and $20,640 median wages for AA and AS degree recipients, respectively). The only non-AAS program featured in the top ten is the lineworker diploma program. All 28 graduates that did not become enrolled in further education matched to employment in their first year after graduation and had median earnings of $40,806. This represents a very strong value as a diploma is typically no more than one year of full-time study, in contrast to associate's degrees which are two years of study. There could be other factors affecting the employment outcomes of these program graduates (pre-existing employment, an abnormal amount of previous experience or a training agreement with an employer), but the data seems to indicate that this a very valuable short- term award. From a broader occupational standpoint, seven of the top ten programs are mechanical, engineering or production-related in nature. These programs prepare students for jobs in 43,398 Awardees 33.9%52.4% 5.7% 3.5% 4.5% Figure 2: Fiscal Year 2010 to Fiscal Year 2012 Iowa Community College Awardees First Year Following Award Source: Iowa Community Colleges Education Outcomes: Diploma, Certificate and Associate Degree Programs27 Iowa's Workforce and the Economy 2015a variety of industries, but most of the jobs would be concentrated in the manufacturing, construction and utilities industry sectors. Two of the top ten are nursing programs and the last is a multi-disciplinary degree customized by either students or employers. The graduate employment data provided in the Iowa Community Colleges Education Outcomes: Diploma, Certificate and Associate Degree Programs report can be useful to a variety of audiences. Prospective students (and parents) can learn how much money they can expect to earn right out of college. Community college administrators can also use this data as part of their program evaluation. There are many other factors to take into consideration when evaluating a postsecondary program, though. Short-term graduate earnings should just be one piece of the puzzle.

For over fifteen years, the Analyst Resource Center (ARC) Employer Database has assisted job seekers with finding information about employers including who the employers are, where they are located, and how they can be contacted. Infogroup, based in Omaha, Nebraska, provides the ARC Employer Database through a contract with the State of Connecticut. Currently, the contract goes through November 30, 2020, if all extensions of the contract are enacted. The ARC Employer Database is an acquired database containing information on over fifteen million employers throughout the country. Job seekers, career counselors, public economic development entities, and other intermediaries have direct access to information about these employers. Access to this database is available through a DVD and an IWD website located at the following web address: http://iwin.iwd.state.ia.us/iowa/employers. The ARC Employer Database is funded by the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration and contracted by the State of Connecticut. The database contains information for all 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each state receives updates of the database from Infogroup twice a year in April and October. The ARC Employer Database has several levels of access to the data: licensee, intermediate user, and end user. The licensees are the State Employment Security Agency (SESA) or State Workforce Agency and the U.S. Employment and Training Administration. The licensee will be able to either download the entire database to a PC or search the database using the DVD directly. The intermediate user, a local One-Stop, public economic development entity, or other service deliverer, can search the entire database and retrieve an unlimited number of partial records of which no more than 250 records can be viewed at one time. The end user, e.g., a job seeker, is able to search a defined area of the database and receive a display of partial records of which not more than 50 records can be displayed or printed at one time. The IWD website provides end user access only. If a state chooses to use the included search application, a number of fields can be searched, including name of business, NAICS code, The ARC Employer Database Contains over 50 Data Elements including: Employer Name Mailing Address Telephone Number Contact Person Internet Address Ownership CodeCensus Tract Fax Number Employment Physical Address North American Industry Classification (NAIC) Mapping LinkFigure 1.
