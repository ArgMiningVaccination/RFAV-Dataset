[3](#B3-pathogens-12-00138)] mRNA vaccines can be produced from linearized plasmid DNA templates or from polymerase chain reaction-based templates by in vitro transcription using phage RNA polymerases such as T7, T3, or SP6 polymerase [ [4](#B4-pathogens-12-00138)] Cap structures can be added during in vitro transcription or enzymatically post-transcription [ [5](#B5-pathogens-12-00138), [6](#B6-pathogens-12-00138)]. All components are animal-material free; however, manufacturing has to be performed with RNase-free materials. Residual DNA is removed by DNase treatment and the resulting mRNA is further purified by bead-based methods, chromatography, or precipitation. These cell-free production steps can be easily standardized and upscaled to obtain clinical-grade material [ [7](#B7-pathogens-12-00138)]. The production of RNA vaccine candidates is fast and an influenza vaccine candidate was reported to have been produced in only 8 days [ [8](#B8-pathogens-12-00138)]. [9](#B9-pathogens-12-00138)]. mRNA is non-infectious and only transiently present in cells due to its degradation by host cell RNases [ [10](#B10-pathogens-12-00138)]. These safety properties have also been demonstrated by the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, which show mainly only mild adverse events [ [11](#B11-pathogens-12-00138), [12](#B12-pathogens-12-00138), [13](#B13-pathogens-12-00138)]. In contrast to vector vaccines, there is no preexisting anti-vector immunity, and immunizations with mRNA can be performed repeatedly [ [9](#B9-pathogens-12-00138)]. Finally, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have been shown to be efficacious and induce potent humoral and cellular immune responses [ [14](#B14-pathogens-12-00138)]. [Figure 1](#pathogens-12-00138-f001)). Like cellular mRNAs, mRNA vaccines are directly translated in situ into the respective antigen. The transfer of mRNA to antigen-presenting cells allows the processing of the expressed antigen by the host cell proteasome and consequent loading onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Additionally, after ingestion of secreted antigens and degradation in the endosome, peptides can be presented by MHC class II molecules. Thereby, both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells can be stimulated, respectively. T cell activation further requires co-stimulatory molecules and cytokine secretion, which may result from innate immune sensing of mRNA vaccines (see below). Besides cellular immune responses, the humoral immune response can also be stimulated by the activation of B cells through secreted antigens. Consequently, antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses are induced by mRNA vaccination. 1.1. Increasing mRNA Stability and Translation Efficiency [17](#B17-pathogens-12-00138), 3-UTR [ [20](#B20-pathogens-12-00138)]. For example, the 3-UTR of the highly expressed -globin gene increases mRNA stability [ [15](#B15-pathogens-12-00138)]. Novel 3-UTR elements can also be identified by cellular library screenings [ [21](#B21-pathogens-12-00138)]. [22](#B22-pathogens-12-00138)]. The poly-A tail usually consists of around 200 units [ [23](#B23-pathogens-12-00138)], but in dendritic cells (DCs) the average size is 120-150 nucleotides [ [24](#B24-pathogens-12-00138), [25](#B25-pathogens-12-00138)]. In addition, the poly-A tail interacts with the cap structure via the poly-A binding proteins and translation initiation factors, forming a loop. Highly expressed genes have been found to have short poly-A sequences and form loops efficiently [ [26](#B26-pathogens-12-00138)]. The influence of poly-A tails on eukaryotic gene expression has been reviewed in [ [27](#B27-pathogens-12-00138)]; however, the precise role of poly-A length in RNA vaccines still needs further investigation. In mRNA vaccines a poly-A tail of 100 nucleotides has been shown to be sufficient for efficient antigen expression and induction of immune responses [ [28](#B28-pathogens-12-00138), [29](#B29-pathogens-12-00138)]. [30](#B30-pathogens-12-00138)]. The eukaryotic cap is a 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap linked to the mRNA by a 5-5-triphosphate bridge (ppp) (m7GpppN structure) [ [31](#B31-pathogens-12-00138)]. Cap-0 structures contain only the m7G cap. Further methylation of the 2-hydroxy-groups of the first ribose moiety generates the cap-1 and additional methylation of the second ribose produces the cap-2 structure. Viral RNAs often contain cap-0 structures, and RNA containing cap-0 structures is recognized by the innate immune system (see below); therefore, cap-1/2 structures are superior for vaccine development. For in-vitro-transcribed mRNA with anti-reverse cap analogues structures can be added enzymatically by 2-O-methyltransferase co-transcriptionally by the CleanCap technology. [34](#B34-pathogens-12-00138)]. 1.2. In Vivo Delivery of mRNA Vaccine Candidates [35](#B35-pathogens-12-00138)]. Therefore, the uptake of mRNA is inefficient in most cell types, with the exception of immature DCs, which take up mRNA by micropinocytosis as part of their normal biological function. After intra-dermal or intra-nodal vaccination with naked mRNA, the mRNA is taken up by lymph node DCs, and inhibiting micropinocytosis abrogates internalization mRNA into DCs by electroporation as a cancer vaccine has been shown to be safe in cancer patients [ [38](#B38-pathogens-12-00138), [39](#B39-pathogens-12-00138)]. [40](#B40-pathogens-12-00138)]. The most widely used of these are mRNAs formulated with lipid nanoparticles (LNP). LNPs are mixtures of cholesterol, ionizable lipids, phospholipids, PEG lipids, and a helper lipid and were initially applied for cancer immunotherapy [ [41](#B41-pathogens-12-00138), [42](#B42-pathogens-12-00138), [43](#B43-pathogens-12-00138)]. The type of lipids and the ratio between them determines the efficiency of the formulation, and the optimal ratio for mRNA vaccines differs from that for siRNA delivery [ [43](#B43-pathogens-12-00138), [44](#B44-pathogens-12-00138), [45](#B45-pathogens-12-00138)]. Use in the current COVID-19 pandemic has shown that LNP-formulated COVID-19 vaccines have high efficacies and are safe in humans [ [11](#B11-pathogens-12-00138), [12](#B12-pathogens-12-00138)]. In randomized controlled trials, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines reduced, compared to placebo, the proportion of participants with confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 and reduced the severity of disease. Little or no difference in serious adverse events was observed between vaccine- and placebo-treated groups [ [46](#B46-pathogens-12-00138)]. 1.3. Modulation of Innate Immune Responses to Enhance Protein Expression by mRNA Vaccines [47](#B47-pathogens-12-00138)]. However, this innate immune response can also have an adjuvant effect on vaccines [ [48](#B48-pathogens-12-00138)]. Several strategies have been used to optimize immunogenicity. [49](#B49-pathogens-12-00138), [50](#B50-pathogens-12-00138), [51](#B51-pathogens-12-00138)]. The dsRNA can potently activate innate immune responses [ [31](#B31-pathogens-12-00138)]. During virus infections, dsRNAs can be sensed by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid LRR-, and pyrin-domain-containing 1 (NLRP1), which results in the activation of diverse signaling cascades leading to inflammation, cell growth inhibition, or cell death [ [52](#B52-pathogens-12-00138)]. dsRNA can be removed by purification of the RNA, e.g., by high-performance liquid chromatography or by cellulose-based purification [ [53](#B53-pathogens-12-00138), [54](#B54-pathogens-12-00138)]. Alternatively, dsRNA generation during in vitro transcription can be reduced by optimizing the nucleoside triphosphate ratios or constructing mutant polymerases for RNA synthesis [ [55](#B55-pathogens-12-00138), [56](#B56-pathogens-12-00138), [57](#B57-pathogens-12-00138)]. Additionally, incorporation of modified nucleosides can reduce the immunogenicity of the single-stranded mRNA [ [58](#B58-pathogens-12-00138)]. For example, pseudouridine and 1-methylpseudouridine prevent sensing by the innate immune system and enable higher antigen expression rates [ [59](#B59-pathogens-12-00138), [60](#B60-pathogens-12-00138), [61](#B61-pathogens-12-00138)]. [62](#B62-pathogens-12-00138)]). However, the impact of residual DNA on mRNA vaccines has not yet been studied in detail. Residual proteins from the in vitro transcription might also stimulate innate immune responses, but such proteins are generally removed by purification. For a review of the sensing of mRNA vaccines, see [ [63](#B63-pathogens-12-00138)]. 1.4. mRNA Vaccine Storage Temperatures [64](#B64-pathogens-12-00138)]. These low-temperature storage requirements affect the global distribution of mRNA vaccines, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Incorrect storage can lead to oxidation and hydrolysis of the RNA and may alter their function [ [65](#B65-pathogens-12-00138)]. Lyophilization might be an alternative storage method as it may enable long-term stability at higher temperatures [ [66](#B66-pathogens-12-00138), [67](#B67-pathogens-12-00138)]. 2. Alphavirus Replicons as Self-Amplifying Vaccine Candidates [10](#B10-pathogens-12-00138)]. Thus, to stimulate a potent immune response, high mRNA amounts and repeated immunizations are necessary. Current COVID-19 vaccines contain 30-100 g mRNA per dose. Self-amplifying (sa) RNA vaccines require a reduced initial amount of RNA, because the mRNA is expanded intracellularly. For example, a dose of only 10 ng saRNA was able to induce a SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response in mice [ [68](#B68-pathogens-12-00138)] and 5 \u00b5g saRNA were successfully used in a clinical trial [ [69](#B69-pathogens-12-00138)]. Vaccines based on this principle make use of the genome of single-stranded positive- or negative-sensed RNA viruses. Negative-sensed viruses need de novo protein synthesis mediated by their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to initiate transcription and require technically-demanding reverse genetics for construction. Therefore, most saRNA vaccines are based on the genome of the of positive-sensed alphaviruses is translated directly. [Figure 2](#pathogens-12-00138-f002)A). It consists of two ORFs: the first encodes the four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4) and the second encodes the five structural proteins (capsid and the envelope proteins E3-E2-6K-E1) [ [71](#B71-pathogens-12-00138)]. [72](#B72-pathogens-12-00138)]. nsP1 is the capping [ [73](#B73-pathogens-12-00138), [74](#B74-pathogens-12-00138), [ [76](#B76-pathogens-12-00138), [77](#B77-pathogens-12-00138)]. Additionally, nsP2 RNA triphosphatase activity [ [76](#B76-pathogens-12-00138), [78](#B78-pathogens-12-00138)], and it induces the shut-off of host cell protein expression [ [79](#B79-pathogens-12-00138)]. nsP3 mediates virus-host and protein-protein interactions, which are essential for viral replication [ [80](#B80-pathogens-12-00138), [81](#B81-pathogens-12-00138)] and nsP4 is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [82](#B82-pathogens-12-00138)]. The replicase complex first synthesizes a full-length negative-sensed RNA, which serves as a template for the synthesis of either the full-length genomic RNA or the subgenomic RNA ( [Figure 2](#pathogens-12-00138-f002)B). In contrast to the nsPs, the structural proteins are translated as a polyprotein from elements for both minus- and plus-strand synthesis. A 51 nt long sequence element within the nsP1 coding sequence is important for RNA amplification [ [84](#B84-pathogens-12-00138)]. Similarly, 3-CSE sequences act as a promoter in negative-strand RNA synthesis and thereby RNA amplification [ [85](#B85-pathogens-12-00138)]. The presence of the 5-' and 3-CSEs thus ensures specific RNA amplification by the alphavirus replicase [ [71](#B71-pathogens-12-00138)]. For the initiation of subgenomic RNA synthesis, the subgenomic promoter (SGP) is required as a CSE ( [Figure 2](#pathogens-12-00138-f002)B). This sequence is usually located in the nsP4 coding sequence, and includes 19 nt upstream and 2-5 nt downstream of the transcription start site [ [86](#B86-pathogens-12-00138)]. Additionally, packaging signals in the nsP1 or nsP2 coding sequence ensure specific packaging of the genomic RNA into virus particles [ [87](#B87-pathogens-12-00138)]. 3. Self-Amplifying RNA Vaccine Candidates [Figure 3](#pathogens-12-00138-f003)A,B) [ [88](#B88-pathogens-12-00138)]. In comparison to conventional mRNA vaccines, the addition of the alphavirus replicase gene of 7-8 kb significantly increases the length of the RNA. Moreover, the viral CSEs are used as 5- and 3-UTR in saRNA vaccines. Thereby, as in alphavirus replication, the replicase can amplify the saRNA and transcribe the subgenomic RNA. The antigen is then translated from the subgenomic RNA [ [89](#B89-pathogens-12-00138)]. Since the replicase efficiently amplifies the antigen-encoding RNA, higher amounts of antigen will be expressed, compared to those obtained from mRNA. Thus, similar immune responses can be achieved using less RNA [ [90](#B90-pathogens-12-00138)]. [68](#B68-pathogens-12-00138), [91](#B91-pathogens-12-00138), [92](#B92-pathogens-12-00138), [93](#B93-pathogens-12-00138), [94](#B94-pathogens-12-00138)]. Recently, preclinical data for a cross-sarbecovirus saRNA vaccine candidate expressing multiple bat and human coronavirus spike antigens showed that it was able to protect against lethal heterologous infections [ [95](#B95-pathogens-12-00138)]. In addition, preclinical tests have been carried out for saRNA vaccines against influenza virus [ [96](#B96-pathogens-12-00138), [97](#B97-pathogens-12-00138), [98](#B98-pathogens-12-00138)], respiratory syncytial virus [ Ebola [ [105](#B105-pathogens-12-00138)], and HIV-1 [ [106](#B106-pathogens-12-00138), [107](#B107-pathogens-12-00138)]. The vaccine candidates were mainly formulated with LNPs and induced high, specific antibody and T cell responses, and showed protection of mice from challenge infections. saRNA vaccines have also been adapted for use against bacterial infections [ [108](#B108-pathogens-12-00138)], parasites like Toxoplasma gondii [ [104](#B104-pathogens-12-00138)], and cancer For reviews see [ [42](#B42-pathogens-12-00138), [111](#B111-pathogens-12-00138)]. In addition, novel gene therapy approaches using mRNA or saRNA for gene replacement therapy are under development. (For a review, see [ [112](#B112-pathogens-12-00138)].) [70](#B70-pathogens-12-00138)]. After administration of a luciferase saRNA, expression returned to baseline levels after one month [ [113](#B113-pathogens-12-00138)]. Moreover, in theory, if the saRNA expresses budding-competent viral glycoproteins, it might be released in vesicles, leading to transfer of the saRNA to additional cells [ [114](#B114-pathogens-12-00138)]. This should be taken into consideration for the safety evaluation of saRNA vaccines. 4. Trans-Amplifying (ta) RNA Vaccine Candidates [115](#B115-pathogens-12-00138)]. For a taRNA vaccine, two RNAs are used. The first is an in vitro-transcribed mRNA that encodes for an alphavirus replicase and can be directly translated in situ. The second RNA, the trans-replicon (TR) RNA, encodes for the respective antigen, which is placed under control of the SGP ( [Figure 3](#pathogens-12-00138-f003)C). The TR-RNA is amplified by the alphavirus replicase in trans, since it contains the alphavirus 5- and 3-CSEs [ [116](#B116-pathogens-12-00138)]. [117](#B117-pathogens-12-00138)]. Recently, an influenza virus taRNA vaccine candidate was constructed using a non-replicating mRNA encoding the replicase gene and a TR-RNA expressing the hemagglutinin of influenza virus. The taRNA was able to induce protective immune responses with less antigenic RNA compared to an saRNA vaccine candidate [ [115](#B115-pathogens-12-00138)]. This is probably because only the short TR-RNA is amplified instead of the long saRNA. Importantly, studies have indicated that amplification of RNA by alphavirus replicases is faster and more with [116](#B116-pathogens-12-00138), [118](#B118-pathogens-12-00138), [119](#B119-pathogens-12-00138)]. [115](#B115-pathogens-12-00138), alphavirus, chikungunya virus (CHIKV), induced a potent humoral and cellular immune response and was able to protect mice from a CHIKV challenge infection [ [120](#B120-pathogens-12-00138)]. Additionally, a novel bivalent taRNA vaccine candidate has been described which involves the delivery of three RNAs: one encoding the replicase and two antigen-encoding TR-RNAs [ [119](#B119-pathogens-12-00138)]. [121](#B121-pathogens-12-00138)]. The use of two RNAs minimizes the risk of transfer of the RNA to further host cells. taRNAs have a shorter RNA compared to saRNAs and, accordingly, scaled-up production is easier. However, two RNAs need to be produced and a formulation for efficient in vivo delivery has not yet been demonstrated. 5. saRNA Vaccine Production and Delivery [122](#B122-pathogens-12-00138)]. [123](#B123-pathogens-12-00138), [124](#B124-pathogens-12-00138), [125](#B125-pathogens-12-00138), [126](#B126-pathogens-12-00138)]. VP-based delivery has several disadvantages; they frequently have suboptimal safety profiles and always retain the potential to revert to a pathogenic virus. In addition, the vector is immunogenic, which makes booster immunizations difficult. The production of saRNA vaccines by in vitro transcription, like conventional mRNA vaccines, bypasses these obstacles. [90](#B90-pathogens-12-00138), [120](#B120-pathogens-12-00138)]. Similarly, naked saRNA was able to induce specific immune responses against HIV 1 and Zika virus [ [127](#B127-pathogens-12-00138), [128](#B128-pathogens-12-00138)]. However, the RNA doses were high and comparable to mRNA vaccines. Various formulations have been shown to improve in vivo delivery of mRNA. Due to the presence of the alphavirus replicase gene, saRNA vaccines are longer than mRNAs and require novel formulations for delivery [ [129](#B129-pathogens-12-00138)]. Multiple approaches for saRNA formulation have been explored. In a comparison of saRNA formulations with liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, and emulsions, the most potent induction of immune responses occurred with 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane polymeric nanoparticles [ [129](#B129-pathogens-12-00138)]. Optimized saRNA LNPs have also been developed based on LNP formulations previously optimized for siRNA and mRNA [ [130](#B130-pathogens-12-00138)]. Formulation of saRNA with LNPs as a COVID-19 vaccine candidate reduced the dose required to induce a robust immune response in mice to as little as 10 ng [ [91](#B91-pathogens-12-00138)]. LNP formulations could similarly be adapted for the taRNA system. Thereby, RNA stability and transmission might be improved, and robust immune responses might be stimulated with lower RNA doses and by intra-muscular application. 6. saRNA Vaccine Candidates and the Induction of Innate Immune Responses [130](#B130-pathogens-12-00138)]. As depicted above for mRNA vaccines, several approaches to circumvent innate immune activation can be applied; however, for sa/taRNA vaccines, nucleoside modifications will be lost during the amplification step and will be of less benefit [ [108](#B108-pathogens-12-00138), [111](#B111-pathogens-12-00138)]. In a taRNA vaccine, the replicase mRNA could be nucleoside-modified; however, the effects remain to be evaluated. In addition, the RNAs can be initially purified to reduce innate sensing [ [122](#B122-pathogens-12-00138)]. [131](#B131-pathogens-12-00138)]. The resulting signaling cascades lead to the production of type I interferons (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines [ [24](#B24-pathogens-12-00138)]. Although the innate response has an adjuvant effect which can promote the specific immune response, it can also induce RNA degradation and thereby reduce antigen expression [ [132](#B132-pathogens-12-00138)]. [133](#B133-pathogens-12-00138)]. Encoding the E3, K3, and B18R proteins of vaccinia virus and the non-structural protein 1 of influenza A virus on a separate mRNA increased antigen expression in vitro and in vivo [ [134](#B134-pathogens-12-00138), [135](#B135-pathogens-12-00138)]. Similarly, innate response-inhibiting proteins encoded in cis on an saRNA were able to increase the stimulated immune responses [ [136](#B136-pathogens-12-00138)]. [79](#B79-pathogens-12-00138)]. Thereby, IFN production is also reduced. Additionally, alphavirus infection and replicase expression are cytotoxic and induce host cell apoptosis [ [137](#B137-pathogens-12-00138)]. The replicase nsPs contain elements that influence RNA amplification and the host cell response. nsP2 induces host cell shut-off leading to cell death [ [79](#B79-pathogens-12-00138)]. The precise effects of this on vaccine applications remain to be elucidated. Interestingly, mutations in the nsP2 of CHIKV have been described that reduce the cytopathic effect [ [138](#B138-pathogens-12-00138)]. Moreover, in an in vitro approach, mutations in the VEEV nsPs have been identified that enhance the synthesis of subgenomic RNA in situ [ [109](#B109-pathogens-12-00138)]. During adaption of CHIKV to A549 cells, two mutations in the replicase gene occurred that increased viral replication [ [139](#B139-pathogens-12-00138)]. Accordingly, the replicase of the sa/taRNA vaccine candidates could be further optimized for higher antigen expression and immunity. [136](#B136-pathogens-12-00138), [140](#B140-pathogens-12-00138)]. Although potent immune responses were induced, direct benefits remain to be demonstrated and clinical data is lacking. Moreover, LNP formulation has adjuvant effects. A comparison of intra-dermal electroporation with LNP delivery indicated that the strong induction of innate immune responses by LNPs reduced antigen expression from saRNA in mouse skin [ [141](#B141-pathogens-12-00138)]. 7. saRNA Vaccine Application for Human Use [69](#B69-pathogens-12-00138)]. The saRNA (LNP-nCoVsaRNA) expressing the pre-fusion stabilized spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events related to vaccination. Although seroconversion rates did not reach 100%, specific antibody concentrations among the seropositive participants were similar to values derived from convalescent sera. However, human responses to SARS-CoV-2 were significantly lower than those predicted by small animal models [ [69](#B69-pathogens-12-00138)]. Another VEEV-based saRNA vaccine candidate (ARTC-021) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein was also found to be safe and had a 100% seroconversion rate. Anti-spike IgG titers were equal to those in COVID-19 convalescent plasma [ [142](#B142-pathogens-12-00138)]. A larger clinical trial is currently ongoing with ARTC-021 as a booster vaccine (NCT05012943). These examples show that saRNA technology is entering clinical development, but further improvements are necessary to generate potent vaccines. 8.
