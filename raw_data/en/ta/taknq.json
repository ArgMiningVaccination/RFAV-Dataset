A pain management clinic that I go to has recommended High Dose Ozone Therapy to cure my nerve pain. Has anyone tried this or have more information about it? I do not have much faith in this clinic since they constantly push expensive treatments and do not help with my medications. The therapy consists of taking out some of your blood, mixing in ozone, and replacing it. They claim it can cure all kinds of things like cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome, etc. Insurance doesn't cover it and the FDA doesn't approve of it either. Interested in more discussions like this?
