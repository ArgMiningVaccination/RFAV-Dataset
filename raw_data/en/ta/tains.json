The tripwas initiated through the univer-sity pilot project CounselorsWithout Borders to providecounseling services by super-vised graduate students. \"I was continually hearing about the mental health needson the Gulf Coast,\" said FredBemak, a counselor educator atGeorge Mason, located in Fair-fax, Va. \"I've been watching thesystem that was set up to bringin people, and they required licensure and two-week mini-mum stays. I was gettingincreasingly mixed messagesthat the needs were not beingmet because they were fargreater than the mental healthresources being deployed.\"Bemak, along with his col-league and wife, Rita Chi-YingChung, decided to escort andsupervise a group of their ownstudents on a mission to assistthose still traumatized by thehurricane. Bemak asked his students if they would be willing to helpthose affected by the hurricane.\"I told them, 'I have a license, and I'll supervise you,'\" he said.\"It's no different than supervis-ing a practicum or internship.\"He added that he believes coun-seling graduate students havethe resources and ability to helpcommunities affected by Hurri-cane Katrina in a professionalcapacity greater than simplyhanding out food or bottles ofwater. \"We can offer our ser-vices to help this underservedpopulation,\" he said.

Ele-mentary, middle and highschools all cite social, interper-sonal or family problems as themost frequent mental healthproblems faced by students. Mental health problems are broadly defined in the new pub-lication, School Mental Health Services in the United States,2002-2003 . They cover a spec- trum of concerns, ranging fromrelatively mild, commonly seenproblems such as difficultyadjusting to a new school, tomore significant behavior prob-lems such as bullying, to seriouspsychiatric and developmentaldisorders. Mental health serviceswere defined as those servicesand supports delivered to indi-vidual students who have beenreferred and identified as having psychosocial or mental healthproblems. \"Taking action to address childhood mental health prob-lems now can save lives, espe-cially when school personnelwork with parents to identifychildren and intervene appropri-ately before they develop signif-icant problems,\" said SAMHSAAdministrator Charles Curie. Topics in the report include: IMental health problems en- countered in school settings ITypes of mental health ser- vices schools are delivering INumbers and qualifications of school staff providing mentalhealth services ITypes of arrangements for delivering mental health servicesin schools, including collabora-tion with community-basedproviders IMajor sources of funding for school mental health servicesVirtually all schools reported having at least one staff memberwhose responsibilities includedproviding mental health servicesto students. The most commontypes of school mental healthproviders were school coun-selors, followed by nurses,school psychologists and socialworkers. School nurses spentapproximately one-third of theirtime providing mental healthservices. The report provides the first national survey of mental healthservices in a representative sam-ple of the approximately 83,000public elementary, middle andhigh schools and their associatedschool districts in the UnitedStates. Free copies of the report are available by calling SAMHSA'sNational Mental Health Infor-mation Center at 800.789.2647or by going online to http:// store.mentalhealth.org/cmhs/ManagedCare/pubs.aspx . IACA IN ACTION School mental health services are subject of national survey By the Numbers: Mental Health in Britain According to Mind, the leading mental health charity in England and Wales, evidence suggests that one in four people with a mental health problem have not contacted a professional for help. Research indicates that people initially seek help from their general practitioner rather than going to a mental health professional. Not everyone who experiences mental distress will come into contact with a service, as the above figures show: (A)300 people out of 1,000 will experience mental health problems every year in Britain; ( B)230 of these people will visit a general practitioner/physician; (C)102 will be diagnosed as having a mental health problem; (D)24 will be referred to a specialist psychiatric service; and (E)six will become inpatients in psychiatric hospitals.\"Libby (Zinman-Schwartz) is trying to take what works in an Eastern culture and combine it with what might work from the West.\" \u2014 Patricia Stevens (See \"When East meets West\" on page 25)The Last Word ACA debuts enhanced website The American Counseling Association launched its new and improved website on Dec. 1, 2005. Located at the same address\u2014 www.counseling.org \u2014 the website was redesigned to make it easier for members and the general public to find information ina more timely and efficient manner. \"Over the years the old site had become more and more diffi- cult to navigate,\" said ACA Executive Director Richard Yep, \"sowe started with a clean sheet of paper to figure out our members'needs. We utilized the latest in web technology and design to fillthose needs and to benefit all of our members and other helpingprofessionals.\" A team of ACA staff members and an outside consultant worked on development of the enhanced website for severalmonths before its launch. The site's new layout, tools and optionswill allow for a more user-friendly experience. \"It's really dynamically driven by content,\" Yep said. \"The whole idea is to predict what you want to see by looking at whereyou have been previously on the website.\" He explained that con-tent will change to fit the visitor based on membership profileinformation, purchases and previously viewed pages. The web development team expects the site to be much easier to navigate for all visitors and to serve as more of a resource. \"It'scleaner and better designed,\" Yep said. \"We have taken some ofthe important and popular items from the old site and incorporat-ed those with new, up-to-date articles, tools and items.\" Noted changes As part of the remodeling, ACA has changed where some items were located. Also, some sections were renamed based on inputfrom users and potential users of the site. Additionally, visitorswill notice that the search function has been upgraded, again inan effort to make the site easier to navigate. The web teamencourages members to explore the new site and to share sugges-tions for further improvements. The login feature has also been revamped. Unlike the prior login prompt, ACA members have the option of setting their ownpassword. The login feature should be a tremendous benefit tomembers in the near future, as they will no longer have to fill outaddress forms and other personal information when purchasingmaterials. The information will be taken directly from the mem-bership database. With that in mind, this would be a good timefor members to update and verify their e-mail addresses and otherpersonal data. To do so, call ACA Member Services at800.347.6647 ext. 222. Suggestions The new website can be described as a \"living document.\" ACA will be consistently providing updated and timely informa-tion to members and the general public. \"We knew at the launch that this would be an ongoing project, and we will be working on it in the next several months,\" Yepsaid. \"We are looking forward to receiving input and suggestionsfrom our members. It's their site, and we want to hear what theyhave to say. This is a team effort, and it won't be as successfulwithout input from our users.\" For questions regarding the website or to make a suggestion, send an e-mail either to webmaster@counseling.org or to ryep@counseling.org .

ILetters Counselors should be on the lookout for OCD's 'cousin' Thank you for Angela Kennedy's article on obsessive-compulsive disorder in Counsel- ing Today (see \"Young obses- sion,\" December 2005). I havebeen a board member of thenational Obsessive-CompulsiveFoundation and started theWestern Pennsylvania affiliatehere in Pittsburgh. I started thefirst support group in Pittsburghin 1989 and am considered anexpert in OCD and trichotillo-mania. The article in Counseling Today was right on target. I would love to write ChrisMcBee and find out where he isso I can refer clients to him. Thankfully, OCD gets much press. Its cousin trichotillomania\u2014 compulsive hair pulling \u2014has the same incidence butreceives very little press. I sowant counselors to learn abouttrichotillomania and the re-sources available to them andtheir clients. For more informa-tion, visit TrichotillomaniaLearning . Joan Kaylor President-Elect, PennsylvaniaCounseling Association www.JoanKaylor.com Reducing stress, burnout with sound strategies for counselor wellness It was with great interest and appreciation that I readJonathan Rollins' article, \"A campaign for counselor well-ness,\" in the October 2005issue of Counseling Today . I tend to agree that quite often ascounselors we hold off harmo-ny and effective balancing as\"there is too much to do with sovery little time.\" Other facets ofmy life, including school, fam-ily, hobbies and interpersonalrelationships, used to be placedon hold with the never-endingintention of addressing them ata later time. Stress, burnout andvicarious trauma are real con-cepts that affect counselors'productivity and effectivenessnot only in the work environ-ment but also in personalgrowth. In my experience as a clini- cian working in rehabilitationprograms with victims of sexu-al, physical and emotionalabuse, as well as with survivorsof domestic violence, I havecome to acknowledge that vic-arious trauma may graduallylead to counselors becomingmore susceptible and reactive toclients' experiences and stories. In addition to the strategies listed in the article to promotecounselor wellness (e.g., estab-lishing a mentor-mentee rela-tionship and peer supervision),other strategies may includephysical activity, involvementin recreational activity and hob-bies, personal counseling, med-itation, sense of spirituality anddevelopment of a supportivesocial network. I have found that using a fewof these interventions has helped to reduce stress andburnout for me as well as con-tributed to my enthusiasm forwork and social environments.My overall sense of harmonyand balance has also improved.

I look forward to my issue every month! As a school counselor (espe- cially one who is on maternityleave), it is wonderful toreceive a publication that ap-plies to allfields of counseling, as well as counseling in theschools. Your newspaper helpsme to feel connected with therest of the counseling commu-nity and helps me to stay up todate with current issues pertain-ing to the fields of counselingand psychology.

In this city outside of Cleve-land, most immigrant familieswere of Eastern European orMexican heritage. PuertoRicans, though U.S. citizens,were still viewed as foreignersbecause they spoke English astheir second language. In fact,Hungarian, Slovenian, Polish,Greek, Russian and Spanishwere languages commonlyheard at the A&P grocery store,at the annual international festi-val or at the bowling alley where we visited with my father. I was fortunate to have spent the first 17 years of my life in atruly multicultural environment,one that celebrated culture-spe-cific festivals, had ethnic Ca-tholic and Protestant churches (aJewish temple was not in our partof town) and had ethnic barrios(neighborhoods). Knowledgeabout world geography and ahealthy curiosity were helpful inlearning about cultural customsand rituals. Thanks to Greekneighbors and school friends, myattendance at a SlovenianCatholic school for grades 1-8 and visits to the first PuertoRican parish with my abuela (grandmother), I learned aboutnorms for adult and child interac-tions, how people decorated theirhomes and different ways ofusing music to celebrate mass. After a rather solemn Sunday mass at our Slovenian parish, Iwas often given permission tovisit my abuela . On the corner lot, across from my abuela' s home, was an African-Americanchurch. I believe it was Baptist.The sounds of loud singing and apowerful organ filled the air. Italways sounded so joyous andfestive. Not unlike the LatinCatholic masses at that time thatwent for an hour or more, theAfrican-American church ser-vices were typically two hourslong. When weather permitted, Iwould sit on my abuela' s porch swing, watching families emergeafter services. The enthusiasmspilled onto the sidewalks asthese impeccably and stylishlydressed adults and childrengreeted one another and madeplans for the afternoon. InLorain, Ohio, I was introducedto people with different culturalheritage and roots from around the world. The meaning, application of counseling practices I was introduced to the concept of ho'oponopono , a Native Hawaiian healing ritual, in 1978in an article that appeared in thePersonnel and Guidance Journal(now the Journal of Counseling & Development ). This ceremony typically occurs among familymembers and is meant to restoreharmony and positive relation-ships within the family by callingon spiritual forces. Subsequently,I have learned about limpiezas , or cleansings, done by healers inLatin American countries. The concept of counseling as we mean it does not easily trans-late into all languages. When Ilooked up translations for coun-seling from English to French, Icould only find the term \"coun-selor,\" but it was more specificto an advocate or attorney. Inother English-speaking coun-tries, coun-tries, psychotherapy is morecommonly used, not counseling.The role of counseling around the world also varies, but in hisstudies about indigenous heal-ing, Courtland Lee found thatuniversal shamanic traditions practices thatinvolve healers \u2014are still practiced in NewZealand and African countries.We all have much to learn andappreciate about the ways thatcounseling can be practicedacross the world, particularlyfrom indigenous worldviews. Courses in multicultural coun- seling provide a glimpse intonon-Western ways of counsel-ing, but these are just sound-bites. In these courses, we alsolearn about cultural worldviewsheld by individuals of AmericanIndian, Asian, African, Latino,Middle Eastern and PacificIsland heritage. It's not surpris-ing that these chapters or first-person accounts are both broadand idiosyncratic. For me, thismeans that what I've learnedabout counseling from differentparts of the world, culture-spe-cific counseling practices andindigenous healing is just the tip(la puntita ) of the iceberg. What Counseling/Counselling around the Personaland professional perspectives La consejeria a trav\u00e9s el mundo/Counsi elle \u00e0 travers le on page 16Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 6Supporting, remembering those who counsel This special issue of Counsel- ing Today is the result of numer- ous hours spent by our writersand editors researching, inter-viewing and writing about coun-seling around the world. Whileno one publication could hope tocover even a small portion ofsuch a diverse and broad topicarea, it is our hope that you willfind the articles both interestingand thought-provoking. Given that the American Counseling Association will bepartnering with the CanadianCounselling Association for ourfirst \"jointly sponsored\" conven-tion in just a few months, thisspecial issue of Counseling Today seems especially timely. Counseling certainly encom- passes a \"world community,\"and for this reason helping pro-fessionals must have the ability to access tools and resources thatwill allow them to do the bestthey can for their clients and stu-dents. At ACA, we recognizethat our role is to support thoseof you doing such importantwork with millions of children,adolescents, adults and familieseach and every day. Our job is tolisten to what you need. I am pleased that last month we launched the latest genera-tion of the ACA website atwww.counseling.org . The new site features a cleaner design thatincludes easier navigation. Thiseffort was the culmination ofmany months of research andfeedback from our members andstaff. I thank all who were part ofmaking this important commu-nication vehicle a reality.In a previous column, I com- mented on the Counselors CareFund, a project of the ACAFoundation. The fund wasdesigned to help our memberswho were impacted by the rav-ages of the hurricanes in theGulf Coast region last fall. Whenit comes to helping others, coun-selors are the best. With the out-pouring of donations to theCounselors Care Fund, I've wit-nessed that same level of caringfor your colleagues who sufferedthrough such devastating events. At the end of December, the Counselors Care Fund had re-ceived donations of more than$15,000. As you may remember,the ACA Foundation matcheseach dollar, resulting in a fund ofmore than $30,000. The heart-wrenching stories of our mem-bers and branches affected bythe hurricanes reinforces to methat the ACA Foundationtrustees made the right decisionin organizing this importanteffort. Your donations are beingput to good use, and I appreciateyour compassion. This column not only acknowledges those of you cur-rently doing such good work,but also recognizes those whomade their mark and are nolonger with us. At the end of 2005, we lost two people whomade significant contributionsto the counseling profession,each in their own unique andtalented way. Roger Herring was a fine author and compassionate edu-cator and was well known for hispositions on issues relative tomulticultural issues in counsel-ing. When he passed away, hehad already authored and editednumerous articles and texts thatare continually cited and refer-enced by others. Perhaps moreimportantly, Roger's passingresulted in many people sharing(via listservs and in print) theimpact that he had on their lives. We also marked the passing of Nancy Pinson-Millburn. Shewas well regarded in the careerdevelopment field and on inter-national issues, and was a strongbeliever in public advocacy onbehalf of those less fortunate.Nancy also worked here at ACAheadquarters and was my boss inthe late 1990s. I came to knowher as a superior scholar, excel-lent communicator and compas-sionate listener. During hermemorial service at the Univer-sity of Maryland, many peoplespoke of her spirit, her humorand how she positively impacted their lives. I remember her assomeone who could easily movewithin the worlds of academiaand advocacy and still be able toconnect with leadership, staffand members. Two of the counseling profes- sion's bright lights have goneout, but what they brought to thetable, and their dedication toconvey the importance and rele-vance of counseling in a globalcommunity, will continue to live on (see related articles on p. 56 and p. 57, respectively). As we begin a new calendar year, I want to wish all of you apleasant, healthy and peaceful2006. Your work is so incrediblyimportant, and I hope you willcontinue in your endeavors tohelp, serve and advocate foryour clients and students. I alsowant you to know that ACA willcontinue to do what we can tosupport you in your good work. As always, I hope you will communicate any comments,questions or suggestions thatyou have.

I Executive Director's Message - BY RICHARD YEP Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 7\"Human life is like a river, constantly passing away, andyet constantly coming on.\" Thisquote resonates in my life rightnow. I am a counselor in train-ing, a nontraditional student, amother, wife, friend and citizen.The number of roles I play andhats I wear at any givenmoment can seem overwhelm-ing. At no time does my lifeseem still. While I can relate sowell to the aforementionedquote, strangely enough, it alsooffers me comfort. The constantcoming and going of life isexhausting at times, but it is lifenonetheless. Being a nontraditional student in a counseling master's pro-gram is a challenge. My dailyplanner doesn't just say that Ihave a test on Friday and a pro-ject due next week. It is alsofilled with daycare drop-off andpickup times, dance classes,swimming lessons and parentmeetings. The challenge hasbeen learning to balance mylove of the counseling profes-sion with my love for my life and family. One of my classes focused on the development of adults. Aquote by Daniel Levinson espe-cially resonated with me: \"Earlyadulthood is the era in which weare most buffeted by our ownpassions and ambitions fromwithin and by the demands offamily, community and societyfrom without.\" He goes on tosay that \"The costs often equalor exceed the benefits.\" Thosewords practically jump off thepage at me because they so per-fectly describe the thoughts thatplague me at times. Before read-ing that statement, I couldn't putmy feelings into words. Know-ing that I was going through a\"normal\" life stage was com-forting, but it still didn't help mein figuring out how to activelydeal with those struggles. Competing passions It is difficult when the passion you have for something also hasthe potential to adversely affect your passion for the peoplearound you. My family hasenjoyed having me home withthem for the last three years, andI have enjoyed being with them.The three children like having amom to come home to ratherthan going to daycare. My hus-band supports my dreams andpassions, but he also misses mewhen a week is particularlybusy. It is wonderful to be lovedand needed so much, but wheredo you draw the line in the sandbetween your passion for peopleand your passion for profession? It's too simplistic an approach to say, \"Just go out and do whatyou want.\" This kind of thinkingjust seems self-centered becausethe choice was consciouslymade to have a husband andchildren \u2014 and to give all thelove and accept all the responsi-bilities that go with them. Butit's also too simplistic to say,\"Well, this in your lot in life, soforgo other passions.\" This lineof thinking wouldn't be true tothe strengths and passions thatare inherently mine. So how doI deal with these conflicts as Iprogress in the counseling pro- fession, my love for it growingby leaps and bounds all thewhile? I've found there is nosimple answer. Many women say they are better moms when they work.Others say they like stayinghome and don't miss working. Iseem to be somewhere in themiddle, with a growing passionfor my profession coupled withan existing passion for my chil-dren and husband. The two pas-sions collide at times as I con-tinue to struggle to find myway as a counselor. A passion for learning further complicates the scenario as anew dream emerges \u2014 to con-tinue on with school and seek adoctorate. While many of myclassmates are counting thedays until graduation, I almostdrag my feet. I truly enjoy theuniversity setting, so thethought of combining my loveof learning with my love of thecounseling profession pushesme ever closer to following apath toward a Ph.D. My family is wonderful and supportive. My struggle is notwith them; instead, it is an inter- nal struggle. Daniel Levinson'swords continue to offer mecomfort, assuring me that this isa normal stage in life. I foolish-ly thought the struggles woulddiminish as I got older, but thathas not been the case. It seemsthe older I get, the more oppor-tunities are presented to me. Learning to live in the moment The process of developing as a counselor has been an interest-ing, frustrating, exhilarating andexhausting journey complicatedat times by the management ofmultiple outside responsibili-ties, but one strategy has madethe struggle easier. My approachis so simple that I am almostembarrassed to write it: Takeone day at a time. As a coun-selor in training I should knowthis, right? But it seems thatknowing something and puttingit into practice are two com-pletely different things. My thoughts often spin ahead to the future, but I find that if IBalancing passionsStudent Focus - BY REBECCA KOLTZ Continued on page 29 Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 8BY STACY NOTARAS MURPHY A female Latino client visits a counselor for an initial session.She asks direct questions abouta specific dilemma and detailsher plans to seek additionalinput from her doctor, priest andgodparents. The client thanksthe therapist, leaves and doesnot return. Many counselors might con- sider this a failure. But accord-ing to Esteban Montilla, theclient's Latin American heritagesuggests there might be more tothe story. Counselors should not neces- sarily expect a traditional treat-ment process to unfold when aLatino client comes seekinghelp, says Montilla, an Ameri-can Counseling Associationmember and director of Education at DriscollChildren's Hospital in CorpusChristi, Texas. \"What I'vefound in the Latino community,both in the U.S. and in LatinAmerica, is what we call 'inter-mittent counseling,'\" Montillasaid. \"When you go once, spend two hours with the counselor,you get the idea and then con-tinue to work on that idea withsome other member of the com-munity \u2014 with physicians, withhealers, with family members.One counseling session is verycommon.\" Montilla advises that the cus- tomary counseling theory ap-proaches frequently do not fitthe Latino population. Headded that counselors workingwith these clients often woulddo well to set aside their usualassumptions about human de-velopment and therapeuticalliance-building. \"We have tobe careful with the traditionalcounseling theories becausemost created under aEuro-American perspective andthe values are different,\" Mon-tilla explained. For example, he said, from the perspective of conventionalcounseling theories, a person'shealthy development relates toself-actualization. \"With [de-velopmental psychologist Erik]Erikson's movement toward autonomy, you have developed wellwhen you are autonomous,\" hesaid. \"But in the Latino com-munity, you demonstrate thatyou have developed well whenyou can live with the others,when you can respect the fami-ly members, when you canrelate within a community andrespect its authority. It's awhole different view of devel-opment.\" On the topic of building a strong therapeutic alliance,Montilla recommends beingmore action-oriented with Latino clients. \"In terms ofcounseling technique, certainlyit is important to include the lis-tening, understanding, validat-ing,\" he said. \"But you needmore than that. You need a littlebit of action. You need theRogerian approach, but if youstay there, the consultee mightthink you don't know verymuch about his problem. Youneed to offer ideas and worktogether. It needs to be a morecollaborative process.\" An ACA action item Not enough counselors under- stand the nuances of counselingin Latin America or workingwith Latino clients, but ACAPresident Patricia Arredondohopes to change that by focusingon the region during her tenure.\"The largest population of newimmigrants to the United Statesis coming from Latin America,\"she said. \"We need to betterunderstand places of origin andwhat that means for those whoare preparing counselors whoare going to work with a reallymulticultural and diverse popu-lation of people.\" Specifically, Arredondo noted the growing trend of partner-ships between U.S. and LatinAmerican counselor trainingprograms. \"Quite often individ-uals are programs have someconnection to ACA or have hadsome training in counseling inthe United States and want tobring these programs to the pop- ulation,\" she explained. In order to potentially culti- vate these partnerships, Arre-dondo commissioned the TaskForce to Explore ACA in Latin America. Stillin the fact-finding stages, thetask force members are compil-ing data for a report to bereleased later this year. \"Without raising expectations that these things can be done,the next step very possiblywould be to see if there areplaces where we can engage inmore partnerships,\" Arredondosaid. \"Maybe findpotential in, say,Argentina and Chile. Maybethere's an association of coun-selors in Venezuela that wecould somehow sign on as abranch. Maybe the training pro-grams have needs and we couldpartner with them to use someof our existing materials.Maybe someone would want towrite a counseling theory bookin Spanish. There are so manypossibilities.\" Task Force Chair Andr\u00e9s Consoli, an associate professorat San Francisco State Univer-sity and president-elect of theInteramerican Society of Psy-chology, noted that the group'sfirst step is simply to get anaccount of the numerous pro-grams already in operation.\"It's my sense that there aremany efforts throughout LatinAmerica,\" he said, \"but they'renot necessarily knowing ofeach other or coming togetherin any fashion, which is alwaysa real challenge. It's a hugegeographical area with millionsof people, which makes it real-ly difficult to know what isgoing on. Part of the hope ofthe task force is to get enoughof a sense of what is going onso that ACA can begin to thinkof building bridges and net-works.\" Lost in translations To that end, Consoli's task force is networking to gatherinformation about variousEmbracing Latin America's nuances Latin American culture often poses challenges for counselors, but it also provides valuable lessons Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 9 training programs and counsel- ing associations in Latin Amer-ica, as well as seeking outbooks, articles and websitesabout counseling in the region.As he explained, simply com-piling a list of Latin Americancounseling terms has become amajor task. \"Part of the challenge in Latin America is: 'What wordwould people use in Spanish tocapture the counsel-ing?'\" Consoli said. \"There'sreally no easy translation.\" Headded that one of the taskforce's first initiatives invitedcounselors to identify how theydefine counseling. \"In somecountries, the word counselingtranslates as consejeria , but that is really a direct translationof English and is not necessari-ly understood as what we meanby counseling. Another transla-tion for counselor could be consejero , but consejero is real- ly more along the lines of an'adviser,'\" he said. Some of the confusion comes from the fact that, dependingon the locale, Latin Americaoffers numerous approaches tocounseling specialization andqualification. On the whole,mental health work in theregion has taken place either ina professional, psychoanalyticenvironment or via a collectionof community-based opera-tions, including schools, reli-gious organizations and gov-ernment programs. \"Psychology has been much more popular in Latin Americathan has been counseling,\"Arredondo noted. \"The focus oncounseling has come principallyby European-trained psycholo-gists. Psychology is considereda science, and that fit in with psychology becoming a disci-pline of study in Latin America,but with a greater focus on psy-choanalysis as the modality oftreatment.\" Psychology degree graduates traditionally have conductedvocational counseling in schoolsin countries such as Argentina,Chile and Uruguay. While anumber of new counselor train-ing programs have launched inLatin America during the last 15years, those graduates mustcompete against career \"coach-es\" and consultants when build-ing their practices. Consoli saidthat by building educationalpartnerships in Latin America,ACA can support counselorswhile also learning new ways toapply counseling principles inother areas. \"We are seeking to be respect-ful of what already is happening in those countries and to see towhat extent that can dovetailwith some of the things that arebeing done here,\" Consoli said.\"It's not like we're going to takethis to Latin America or we'regoing to bring from Latin Amer-ica what's there. There will beoverlap, but we also know thereare significant differences fromwhich we all can learn.\" Forexample, he noted that familytherapy and group therapy con-ventionally have been valuedinterventions in Latin America,with some of the groundbreak-ing work being done by Latinocounselors who have taughttheir skills in the United States. Strength from the family \"There are very significant strengths in Latin America,things we can learn from here,\" Consoli said, \"especially alongthe lines of values. For example,family and friendship are verysignificant values in LatinAmerica. The family is not onlydefined as the nuclear unit butby the extended family, and thathas been a very significantbuffer to the other challengespeople face in these countries.Even though people may nothave jobs because unemploy-ment is high, people havelearned how to share limitedresources. Even though thefinancial resources are limitedcompared to those in the U.S., Iwould say that human capital inLatin America is phenomenal.The richness of human contactis immeasurable.\" Consoli's own education was made possible through the Continued on page 23Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 10Ethics Update - BY DAVID KAPLAN Editor's note: American Counseling Association members received the 2005ACA Code of Ethics bundled with the December 2005 issue of Counseling Today. (It is also available online at www.counseling.org/ethics .) Completed over a three-year period, this revision ofthe ethical code is the first in a decade andincludes major updates in areas such asconfidentiality, dual relationships, the useof technology in counseling, selectinginterventions, record keeping, end-of-lifeissues and cultural sensitivity. All ACA members are required to abide by the ACA Code of Ethics , and 22 state licensing boards use it as the basis foradjudicating complaints of ethical viola-tions. As a service to members, Counsel- ing Today is publishing a monthly column focused on new or updated aspects of theACA Code of Ethics . ACA Chief Profes- sional Officer David Kaplan conducted thefollowing interview with ACA Code Revi-sion Task Force Chair Michael Kocet. David Kaplan: For many, many years the Code of Ethics stated that confidential- ity was to be broken if there was \"clearand imminent danger.\" The 2005 codenow states in Section B.2.a. that confiden-tiality is broken when there is \"serious andforeseeable harm.\" Could you tell ACAmembers why the task force changed thewording from \"clear and imminent dan-ger\" to \"serious and foreseeable harm\"? Michael Kocet: The task force felt that there were broader circumstances thatneeded to be brought into account. Also,the legal language of the Tarasoff rulinghad an impact in terms of duty to warnand duty to protect and who is the fore-seeable victim or if foreseeable harm canbe identified. DK: So the word \"foreseeable\" actually came from the Tarasoff case? MK: That is my understanding. DK: How would you suggest that pro- fessional counselors think differently andmake the shift from \"clear and imminentdanger\" to \"serious and foreseeableharm\" when considering the need tobreak confidentiality? MK: I still see the essence of breaking confidentiality revolving around \"clearand imminent danger,\" but what \"seriousand foreseeable harm\" does is to allow abroader scope of other circumstanceswhere counselors need to seek consulta-tion and seek ethical advice when consid-ering the breaking of confidentiality. DK: So \"serious and broader than \"clear and immi- nent danger\"? MK: : I think so. It recognizes that in some cultural and contextual situationsclients may not have the need to maintaintraditional confidentiality. For example,the client may ask that you automaticallyconsult a member of his or her spiritual orreligious community. I've also used theexample of a counselor who is seeing aclient who has a terminal illness, hasexhausted all medical options, is psycho-logically healthy and lucid and rationalwith no substance abuse or major depres-sion, and says, \"I want to explore endingmy life. I want your counseling and sup-port through this process.\" Since \"seriousand foreseeable harm\" can be contextual,the counselor has the option of workingwith this client. DK: Is \"serious and foreseeable harm\" always contextual? MK: No. As an example, if a client says, \"I am going to go home and shootmy partner,\" that is objectively foresee-able harm. DK: If we can focus on the word \"fore- seeable\" for a moment, under the old 1995code a client who told us that a crime wascommitted in the past had that informa-tion kept confidential because it occurredin the past and there wasn't any clear dan-ger in the present. Does this also applyunder the 2005 code? MK: I would agree. There is no fore- seeable harm to an event that occurred inthe past. DK: A focus of the 2005 code seems to be an emphasis on consulting with otherprofessional counselors if you are consid-ering breaking confidentiality. MK: The task force supported a team approach. Consulting with other profes-sionals when faced with an ethical situa-tion is always a good step and helps you tothink about different options. The bottomline is that two (or three or four) heads arebetter than one. Of course, you still havean obligation to only reveal informationgermane to the consultation. DK: The focus of the 2005 code on the importance of consulting with colleaguesis in keeping with court rulings that havecome out since 1995 indicating that inorder to maintain minimal standards ofcare, a reasonable counselor will consultwith other professional counselors whenbreaking confidentiality. MK: Sure, and it also matches most, if not all, of the ethical decision-makingThe end of 'clear and imminent danger' models that are in texts and the literature. And in my opinion, consultation can bean ethics textbook, a journal article or atelephone conversation in addition to aface-to-face office visit. DK: That is really interesting. I hadn't thought of that. Being a baby boomer, Iusually think of face-to face consulta-tion. Section B.2.a of the new Code ofEthics specifies that counselors consultwith other professionals when in doubtas to the validity of an exception. Doesthat mean that if a counselor does notconsult when breaking confidentialitythat they have been unethical? In otherwords, are we at the point in the profes-sion where we are saying that if you areabout to break confidentiality, we knowyou have to consult and it is unethicalnot to do so? MK: The key phrase is \"when in doubt.\" Let's go back to the example ofthe client who says, \"I have a gun, andI'm going to go home and shoot my part-ner.\" To me, in that moment, that does notraise doubt about breaking confidentiali-ty. But, for example, when we talk aboutsomething like HIV and AIDS, it doesbecome grayer. For example, a client whosays they just found out that they are HIVpositive, are angry and upset, and aregoing to have unprotected sex with theirpartner and neighbor is a situation that Iwould run by a colleague to get someconsultation and feedback. I Next month: Updates involving romantic/sexual relationships Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.orgCounseling T oday IJanuary 11 Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 12BY STACY NOTARAS MURPHY When Rebecca Sears started presenting on Imago Relation-ship Therapy in St. Petersburg,Russia, five years ago, sheassumed her translator knewwhat she meant when she saidcounseling could help couples\"connect.\" Soon, however, theconfused faces of her studentshinted that something wasn'tquite making the transition fromEnglish to Russian. \"I eventually found out that they were translating the word'connect' into a word that hassomething to do with legs beingchained together,\" said Sears, aWashington, D.C.-based thera-pist, American CounselingAssociation member and facul-ty member of the Imago Inter- national Institute. \"It had a realnegative connotation, some-thing more like being burdened,held back or held down. I wasthinking there must be some-thing really powerful about thiswork because, even with thattranslation, they still wanted tohear more.\" Language translation is just one of the many challengesSears has learned to negotiatewhile presenting on the Imagoapproach each of the last fiveyears at an annual conflict-reso-lution conference in St. Peters-burg. The six-day conference,co-sponsored by the AmericanCommon Bond Institute and theRussian Harmony Institute,explores how conflict trans-forms all kinds of relationships, from the interpersonal to theinternational. The Imago model helps cou- ples connect more consciouslyby using intentional dialogue toinitiate safe communication. InRussia, Sears applies these prin-ciples to multiple scenarios forconflict resolution. By mirror-ing, validating and empathizing,conversation partners avoid see-ing one another as their ownprojections and instead deepentheir understanding for theother's point of view. Sears'2001 workshop on transformingconflict into compassion was sopopular that the conferenceorganizers continue inviting herback each year. Counseling as a new language During her workshops, Sears teaches the theory and thenrequests volunteers for dialoguedemonstrations. In the UnitedStates, most of the workshopparticipants are couples, but inRussia, most attendees are spon-sored by their employers andrarely know each other. Despiteboth this unfamiliarity and thelanguage barrier, Sears hasn'texperienced wait,\" wants to be theguinea pig.\" Sears also appreciates what she described as the Russianwillingness to approach educa-tion with a spirit of companion-ship. \"The entire conferencegroup really becomes like a lit-tle family,\" she explained.\"We're all in residence together,24 hours a day. It's totallyunlike an American conference.(In Russia) we're all going tothe sauna at night together andeating and drinking together.It's very intimate.\" Imago emphasizes the rela- tional interactions between peo-ple. As such, it demands that thetherapist step out of the\"expert\" role and act as a facili-tator. Sears said this differenceis particularly challenging inRussia, where the counseloroften is considered an authorityfigure. \"I've even observedsome difficulty in dealing with group dynamics at the confer-ence,\" Sears said, describing aroundtable discussion. \"It waschallenging for them to movefrom a cognitive level into amore personal discussion. TheWesterners seemed to do itmore easily, most likely becausewe've had more practice.\" Complicating matters is the fact that few Russian counselorshave had their own personalexperience of therapy. \"Some ofthe students have done counsel-ing with the faculty in their ownprograms,\" Sears said. \"It's atotal luxury to be able to do that.No one thinks about the conflictof interest because it's so rare anopportunity.\" Sears faces the same imbal- ance between the number offemale and male students inRussia that many counselingprograms experience in theUnited States. Last May, shehosted a post-conference train-ing session in which womenoutnumbered men by a ratio of4-to-1. She hopes that introduc-ing the material at an academiclevel will invite equal participa-tion between the sexes in thelong run. \"My experience is thatthe men at the daylong work-shop appreciate it as much as thewomen,\" she said. \"What weknow about all of this relation-ship stuff is that if something'snot working for one person, it'snot working for the other. If it'snot working for her, it's notworking for him; it's just adefense.\" Participation in Sears' work- shop is not limited to counselorsand psychotherapists. Attendeesalso include academics, educa-tors and civil servants, each ofwhom take Imago's communi-cation principles back to his orher own work environment. Theconferences have even inspiredSears' translator, a foreign lan-guages expert, to return toschool to study counseling. The enthusiasm of the infor- mation exchange has becomeone of the highlights of Sears'experience in Russia. She relat-ed the story of a Chechen jour-nalist who was reporting on theworkshop. He took Sears asideduring a break and implored her Comrades in compassion Counselor travels to Russia to make cultural connections Rebecca Sears\"Russians don't do therapy like we do,\" she said, \"and what isbeing done is on a very smallscale. Transportation andmoney to pay for such servicessimply do not exist. The psy-chologists there want to train intherapy and want it to occur, butmost have jobs at schools oruniversities.\" She added thatgovernment corruption and cul-tural stigmas continue to make mental health services difficultto obtain. Alcoholism and spousal abuse are major issues for the Russianpeople, Sears explained, so shehas been inspired to introducethe relational approach of Imagotherapy as a way of improvingquality of life. \"Just like every-where in the world, being in anintimate relationship is the hard- est thing you'll ever do,\" Searssaid. \"But because we're rela-tional creatures, we all long forit. Russia is a very difficultcountry to live in. The peopleare very connected, but they'revery alone.\" Sears has found consistent interest in the potential of theImago approach to change Rus-sia's political landscape by helping people see another per-spective. \"Russian historyoffers some fascinating exam-ples of how the spirit ralliesitself to be hopeful over andover again,\" Sears said. \"At theconferences they say, 'Comeback and help us,' and they just Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 13to record a video message to his wife begging her not to divorcehim. \"With tears in his eyes, heasked me to tell her that he'knew what to do now' and thatshe should give him anotherchance,\" Sears recalled. \"What inspires me is (the Russian people's) incredibleresiliency,\" she said. \"Therestill is the total faith and hope inthe human condition within acountry that has seen centuriesof anguish. There's a depth ofconversation, of connectednesswith Russians that I don't havein this country. I think that actu-ally comes out of the difficul-ties. People need to rely ontheir inner resources morebecause they don't have all ofthe things that help us avoidrelationship in this country. Theconversations I have with Rus-sians are 10 times deeper thanthe conversations I have with amajority of Americans \u2014 evenas a therapist.\" Counselor as diplomat With all the red tape involved in teaching halfway around theworld, plus the continuinginstability of the Russian econ-omy, Sears' commitment toteaching counseling abroad isvery much a labor of love.From navigating politicalwaters to ensure her visa toimporting appropriate studymaterials, she has invested herown time and money to makeconnections between cultures. Despite the costs involved, Sears said the mutual benefitscreated by her work in Russiainspire her to raise the neces-sary funds to return each time.Her workshop has grown annu-ally, with the number of newparticipants matching the num-ber of returning attendees.Sears is struck by how her rela-tively simple discussions aboutcommunication skills have gar-nered such interest. \"They really love this mater- ial. Under communism, theyreally couldn't have any suchthing as a personal problem,\"Sears explained. \"Psychologywas just an academic subject,because everything else wascollective and about the group.The individual was not impor-tant. Even the training pro-grams today are still very acad-emic. Cognitively, they know alot of theory and are very acad-emically minded, but clinical-ly, there is much learning leftto be done.\" Part of this lack of clinical awareness, Sears noted, relatesto the narrow demand forcounseling services due topolitical and economic factors.Continued on page 22 Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 14 Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 15The rainbow dog: A postmodern fableFinding Your Way - BY N. DEWAINE RICE Finding my way in the world of DSM diagnosis has been a struggle at best. By the time Ifinished my doctorate in 1980, Ihad been told many times thatone of the important differencesbetween counselors and othermental health professionals wasthat \"we do not label people.\" From 1980-1994, I worked as a university administrator andhad little contact with the coun-seling profession. I returned tocounseling in 1994, when I tooka faculty position teaching coun-seling and opened a small pri-vate practice. I was surprised athow much things had changed. Iquickly discovered that coun-selors not only label people, butwe often mislabel people toreceive insurance payments. Wedo research on \"upcoding\" and\"downcoding,\" but those arejust academic terms for lying. We still maintain a holier-than-thou attitude by blaming it onmanaged care and the evils ofDiagnostic and Statistical Man-ual of Mental Disorders diagno- sis, but we do play the game. Welobbied hard for our right to beincluded in third-party pay-ments and gladly accepted thecheck. I questioned if we hadsold our souls for money. I soon realized I was the one out of step with the times andeven took a couple of courses soI, too, could diagnose (label)people. Actually, I am rathergood at it. Last semester Iproudly taught our doctoratelevel course on diagnosis andmental health interventions. Ifind that DSM diagnosis is a helpful way of conceptualizingclients' problems, plus it givesus a common language to com- municate with other mentalhealth professionals, insurancecompanies and clients. It is hard to imagine develop- ing a treatment plan withoutsome system for conceptualiza-tion of the presenting problem.Yet, I still wonder if there wasn'twisdom in our antiquated posi-tion of not labeling people. Onecolleague explained to me thatwe still do not label people; welabel the disorder. Sounds likehypocritical semantics to me. Of course other mental health professionals make the sameclaim. The DSM actually makes that point itself. It is a veryimportant distinction. However,I fear that the client and societyoften miss the point. Just aspatients suffering from epilepsyquickly become epileptics, peo-ple suffering from schizophreniaquickly become schizophrenics.Many of us also contend that wedo not adhere to the medicalmodel. I guess we didn't readthe DSM manual very carefully. I still don't know my exact posi-tion on DSM diagnosis, but I do know it is a double-edgedsword. The following fablereflects some of my concerns. Once upon a time ... Once upon a time there lived a puppy named Postty. Posttywas full of life. He loved to run,jump and play, and he appreci-ated all of God's creation. Hewas very curious and continual-ly explored his world in searchof truth. One day after a rain-storm, Postty found a rainbow.He had always been afraid ofrainstorms but was fascinatedby the perfect curve of the rain-bow. He wondered where thebottom half of the rainbow was.He studied the gentle changesof colors. With great delight anda sense of accomplishment,Postty returned to his village toshare his wonderful discovery.He talked at great length aboutthe rainbow and its many fasci-nating colors. Since dogs arecolorblind, none of his friendshad ever seen a rainbow. Butfull of excitement, Postty con-tinued to talk incessantly abouthis rainbow. Thinking Postty was boasting and being pretentious, the otherdogs began to laugh and makefun of him. They called Posttythe rainbow dog. This hurt Post-ty's feelings and made him verysad and angry. He ran home to tell his mother, Fem, about therainbow. She understood every-thing and always listened toPostty. Nobody knew for certainwho Postty's father was, but hewas pretty sure he had one. Postty told his mother all about the rainbow and its beau-tiful colors. Fem listened withboth amazement and apprehen-sion. She often interrupted Post-ty to ask about the relationshipsbetween the different colors.Postty didn't understand hismother's many questions andbecame perturbed. During the months to come, almost everyone in doggy worldheard of Postty and his rainbow.Postty told the story every timehe got the chance. Those incharge eventually prohibited himfrom talking about it at puppyschool. The adult dogs becamevery concerned and wouldn't lettheir puppies play with Postty.When Postty did play with theother puppies, they treated himdifferently than before. He knewthey were talking behind hisback, and they often made fun ofhim to his face. Continued on page 24Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 16From the President Continued from page 5 I don't know is vast, but I endeavor to learn from others. Ibelieve the American Counsel-ing Association can be a vehiclefor all of us to learn about howcounseling is practiced in otherparts of the world. Learning through professional partnerships ACA has members through- out the world, and counselingassociations are alive and wellin Britain, Puerto Rico,Venezuela, Hong Kong, NewZealand and so on. ACA mem-ber Rita Chung of GeorgeMason University is originallyfrom New Zealand. She reportsthat the New Zealand Associa-tion of Counsellors is very pro-gressive in establishing ethics.The British Association forCounselling and Psychotherapyhas an annual presence at theACA Convention, as do mem-bers of the International Associ-ation of Counseling. The ACAInternational Committee isdesigned to foster relationsamong counselors from differ-ent parts of the world, facilitat-ing inclusion, respect and learn-ing across cultures. At theACA/Canadian CounsellingAssociation Convention in Montreal, March 30-April 3,International Committee Co-Chairs Mary Alice Bruce andDaya Sandhu will host a ses-sion. Presenters will includecounseling leaders from Africaand Latin America. In the past few years, coun- selors from Latin American haveorganized annual conferences toexchange information aboutcounselor training initiatives inMexico as well as Central andSouth American countries. Themost recent conference was inVenezuela at the end of Novem-ber. In recognition of the in-creased interest in counseling inLatin America, I appointed theTask Force to Explore Opportu-nities for ACA in Latin America.An article by Task Force ChairAndr\u00e9s Consol\u00ed appeared in theNovember issue of Counseling Today . Members of this task force are located in Guatemala,Puerto Rico and Mexico. ACA member Dan-Bush Bhusumane reports that a num-ber of countries in Africa havenational counseling associa-tions. These include the Bot-swana Guidance and Coun-selling Association, the Coun-selling Association of Nigeria,the Kenyan Association of Pro-fessional Counsellors, the National Guidance and Coun-selling Association of Zambiaand the Ugandan CounsellingAssociation. In addition, theAfrican for Guid-ance and Counselling continuesto encourage and support coun-selors in forming associations. There are also counselor train- ing programs in Korea, Gua-temala, Germany, South Africa,the Virgin Islands, Guam andother countries too numerous tomention. With many of theseprograms, ACA and ACA lead-ers have played a supportiverole. For example, at the Univer-sidad del Valle in Guatemala,program director and ACAmember program modeledafter CACREP standards. ManyACA members, including my-self, have gone there to teach.Many of us teach in Spanish,which is quite an adventure butalso an opportunity to stretch ourlinguistic skills. Your ACA leadership also rec- ognizes that the United States isa microcosm of individuals andcultures from around the world.Immigrants from Mexico andother parts of Latin America arethe most numerous new arrivals. With this in mind, the ACA Pub-lications Committee has pro-duced its first Spanish languagecounselor training com-plete with English subtitles andclosed captioning for the deaf.This product will be valuable topractitioners and counselor edu-cators, and can serve as a careerawareness tool with bilingualstudents. The DVD will pre-miere at the national conventionin Montreal. Cross-cultural learning I have always been cautious about imposing Western- orU.S.-created counseling modelson other countries. However,since counseling as a professionis still fairly new in some coun-tries, a lot of borrowing occurs.Our counseling texts are trans-lated and used to prepare futurecounselors in Korea, Brazil,Puerto Rico and other countries.My hope is that in the yearsahead, ACA will be able to sup-port country-specific counseloreducators to develop more cul-turally appropriate counselingmodels and publications. I amreminded of the work of anthro-pologist Edward Hall, who wasmost instructive about nonverbalcommunication and proxemics or the study of the use of inter-personal space. His researchindicated that the meaning ofcommunication behavior is var-ied; what is respectful in onecultural context may be insultingin another. In counseling cours-es, we teach about the value ofthe YA VIS client \u2014 one who isyoung, attractive, highly verbal,intelligent and socially oriented.But is this concept valued cross-culturally? The answer is a defi-nite \"no.\" We have so much toshare and learn from counselingacross the world. Context andcultural difference do matter. As we move into yet another \"new year,\" I hope you will seekout opportunities to learn aboutcounseling in another country aswell. In the short term, we willhave the opportunity to partici-pate in the first ACA conferencein Montreal. I encourage you tosit in on French and Spanish lan-guage sessions. Pay attention tothe nonverbal behavior as wellas to other communicationnuances \u2014 tone, use of spaceand body movement. In the spir-it of the conference theme, Ibelieve that culture-centered anddiversity counseling empowersall counseling professionals.Vive le difference . I Counseling. A better life for all.

But as evidenced by theEuropean Branch of ACA, aswell as efforts to develop tieswith multiple foreign profes-sional counseling associations,ACA doesn't view its missionas being confined to the bound-aries of the United States. Here is a glimpse at the inner workings, goals and achieve-ments of EB-ACA and ACA'sBritish counterpart, the is a voluntary, non- profit professional organizationdedicated to the support of Eng-lish-speaking counselors living and working in Europe. CharlesLatimer established EB-ACAnearly 50 years ago, and todaythe organization has more than200 members. Like ACA, the European Branch is managed by a Boardof Governors, a body of 10-12volunteers dedicated to main-taining the organization's exis-tence and professional activi-ties. The current Board of Gov-ernors is composed of coun-selors from various back-grounds, including schoolcounseling, addictions and sub-stance abuse counseling, coun-selor education, medical/well-ness counseling, mental healthcounseling, social work coun-seling, and marriage and EB-ACA provides itsmembers with an award-win-ning quarterly scholarlynewsletter, Neues Perspectives for the European Counselor , which covers issues and trendsin the field of counseling aswell as information regardingtraining/continuing educationopportunities. Being true to its motto of \"Stay Connected,\" EB-ACAalso publishes and distributes amembership directory to en-courage members to networkwith each other. \"We feel weprovide a sort of home base forEnglish-speaking counselorsliving and working in countrieswhere English is not the mainspoken language,\" said Board RebeccaBrickwedde. Modeled after structure, president each year. Butthe EB-ACA president also com-mits to representing the associa-tion the year prior to and the yearafter taking office. The organiza-tion's current president isFrankie Nielsen, a middle schoolcounselor with the Departmentof Defense.

We have a fantastic board,and we are really in good shapeand keep busy with LearningInstitutes throughout the year, aswell as a number of other ser-vices, including our newsletterand our website.\" Like Nielsen, the majority of EB-ACA members are Ameri-cans, many of whom workdirectly or indirectly with U.S.military forces serving overseasor with American universities inEurope. EB-ACA also has manymembers who have privatecounseling practices or whowork in other European agen-cies that serve the English-speaking community. \"We alsohave American members livingin the United States, many ofwhom once lived here in Europeor came to present a training(session) for us and wanted tostay connected to their overseascounseling friends,\" Brickwed-de said.

In the preface of their book, Duane Halbur and KimberlyVess Halbur express the hopethat readers will find their bookboth refreshing and meaning-ful. By book's end, the authorsmake good on that modest hopeand deliver much more. Theirtreatment of theory develop-ment \u2014 the perennial chal-lenge to every student coun-selor \u2014 is insightful, practicaland thought-provoking. The authors make a com- pelling case for jettisoning theinformal and sometimes inco-herent approaches found in ec-lectic styles of counseling. Theyargue that the marketplace, ethi-cal practice and responsible carerequire a professional account-ability that is easier to verify if acounselor follows the blueprintand insight provided by a theo-retical perspective. The authors believe the first step toward developing a theo-retical orientation is for nascentcounselors to know themselves.To this end, they provide struc-tured writing exercises, objec-tive personality assessments andguided reflections. The secondstep is to know the major,proven theories. The authorshave identified 15 theoreticalmodels, delineating each by itsphilosophy, goals of therapy andspecific therapeutic five overarching schoolsof thought: psychodynamic,behavioral, prag-matic and contrasting intro- spection (know yourself) andexploration (know the theory)come together in the most inno-vative offering of this text, theSelective Theory Sorter (STS).The sorter is a simple, self-scored tool will shape anddefine the often nebulous andambivalent thoughts counselingstudents have regarding theoret-ical orientation. While present-ed as just \"another tool for self-exploration,\" STS is clearly thekeystone of this endeavor. It isin the STS experience where thebeginning counselor's valuesand self-expression are givenform in a theoretical orientation. A number of counselors shy away from developing a domi-nant theoretical orientation. Per-haps they view the choice of atheory as subscribing to a type of constricting orthodoxy, be-lieving for instance that \"If I ampsychodynamic, I cannot bepragmatic\" or \"If I am pragmat-ic, I cannot be humanistic.\"Eclecticism prospers becausecounselors want to keep alloptions of therapy open forthemselves and their clients,using whatever techniques arebelieved to work in a given situ-ation. This is a respectable idea,but as these authors warn, itmay come at the price of effica-cy, ethics and professional iden-tity. Reviewed by Stephen G.

Unattended Sorrow: Recovering From Loss and Reviving the Heart By Stephen Levine, 2005, New York: Holtzbrinck Publishers, 225 pages, $23.95, ISBN: 13978-1- 59486-065-2. The impact of grief and loss is evident in every area of ourlives. No emotion is morecommon to our dailyexperience. StephenLevine, longafter and of grieving\"has ended, unattended sor-row lingers, accounting for ahost of physical, emotional andspiritual maladies. It is notuncommon for those with unre-solved grief to lean towardaddictions or self-destructivebehaviors. Levine offers exquis-itely sensitive insights into theprocess of grieving, covering itfrom a psychological as well asphysiological perspective, anduses an existential perspectiveto reveal meaning beyond suf-fering. He provides a profound-ly compassionate book thatoffers deep healing. Early in the book, Levine out- lines the dimensions of grief,describing how acute loss canbecome entangled with chronicgrief, magnifying our sorrow.He defines two kinds of chronicgrief. The first is incomplete orinterrupted grief from earlier loss. The second is inherent,ordinary grief that results fromunsatisfied desire, lost promisesand impermanence in the worldaround us, such as natural disas-ter, famine and war. Our chron-ic grief or \"unattended sorrow\"contains everything we havelost and all we will never have.The work described in the bookhelps to process the grief beforeit produces such emotions asanxiety, fear or anger. Levine states that feelings of loss do not go away; they godeeper, causing hard contrac-tions in the mind and body \"suf-fering.\" Sorrow causes a physi-cal \"hardening of the belly.\" Heoffers specific methods fortracking sorrow through thebody, paying particular atten-tion to using the breath to soft-en the pain and to let life backinto the body. Methods to openthe heart and soften the bellyare also described, such assinging, forgiveness and over-coming perfection. The final chapters address confronting our sorrows withmercy and self-acceptance tosmooth the path to healing theheart. Using a Buddhistapproach, Levine describes amethod of cultivating mercyand loving-kindness for our-selves. By observing ourattachment to desires or expec-tations, we can become mind-ful of the causes of suffering.Mindfulness allows us to movethrough fear and loss, becom-ing aware of the presentmoment and expanding thecontinued opening of the heart.As the heart revives, findingmeaning beneath the sorrow ispossible, and returning to asense of gratitude for all thathas been learned may arise.Levine gives us the sense there is meaning to the journeytoward our deepest healing aswe are able to go beyond whatwe know into the unknown,where all growth occurs. Levine has provided an exceptional resource with prac-tical applications in a reader-friendly style. Through itspages, he communicates deepawareness and genuine com-passion for the reality of thegrieving process. His years ofexperience working with deathand dying enable him to offerprofound and intense wisdomon the meaning of death. Thisis an excellent book for clientswho are experiencing loss.Counselors will find its contenthelpful in expanding theirawareness of the emotionalimpact of unresolved grief anduseful in its clinical methods torelieve suffering.

Murphy, 2006, Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Edu- cation Inc., 163 pages, $44, ISBN: 013188249X. Having worked as a school psychologist for 13 years, John Murphy is all too familiar with the challenges of working in a school set- ting. He under- stands that time is a limited resource and com- prehends the need to seize everyopportunity, even if it is in thehallway, lunchroom or parkinglot. In this three-part book, hepresents an easy-to-follow for-mat for incorporating solution-focused counseling into aschool setting. In part one, Murphy presents a case study to help the readerunderstand how solution-focused counseling is differentfrom traditional approaches. Healso reviews the research onwhat works in counseling,reminding us that client factorshave the largest impact oncounseling outcomes. In thefinal chapter of part one, Mur-phy explains how he drawsfrom the works of Milton Erick-son, the Mental Research Insti- tute and the work of Steve deShazer and colleagues at theBrief Family Therapy Center.He presents six assumptionsthat are based on these thera-peutic approaches. The assump-tions, which include \"If it does-n't work, do something differ-ent\" and \"A small change caninitiate a solution,\" inform thisapproach with middle and highschool students. In part two of the book, Mur- phy devotes a chapter to eachstep in the process. He explainshow to accept the client's posi-tion, match the client's lan-guage and use presuppositionallanguage to establish and main-tain relationships. Readers willfind his chapter on interviewingfor solutions particularly help-ful. He explains how to conducteach part of the interview andgives several sample questions.The remaining chapters on uti-lizing exceptions, utilizingclient resources and changingthe doing or viewing of theproblem are equally well done.Murphy provides detailed ex-planations and case studies tomake the material understand-able. He also provides practiceexercises at the end of eachchapter to help the reader im-plement the ideas. In the last part of the book, Murphy provides some trou-bleshooting tips for those timeswhen things aren't working andideas for implementing solution-focused counseling in otherareas of the reader's profession-al life. He also offers several re-sources in the appendix, includ-ing surveys, awards and lettersthat can be reproduced. The amount of detail and ex- planation, in combination withthe case studies, makes thisbook ideal for new school pro-fessionals, for professionalslooking for a new approach orfor counselors in training.

Efforts under way to increase visibility ofschool-employed mentalhealth professionals Recent natural disasters in the United States have alertedmembers of Congress and themedia to the need for qualityschool-based mental health ser-vices. Presented with an oppor-tunity to teach policymakersabout the professionals provid-ing these services, ACA isworking with other organiza-tions to explain the vital role of school counselors, schoolsocial workers and school psy-chologists. This effort is espe-cially critical now because anumber of bills are being draft-ed to enhance mental healthservices in schools. However,these bills do not appropriatelydistinguish between school-employed professionals andcommunity-based providers.

Inorder to have meaningfulaccess, people learned thatthey'd have to share. Other-wise, you won't have it.

Counselingas a of LatinAmerica's historical values.\" Montilla noted that coun-selors working with Latino populations can draw on aclient's community as an assetin their work. \"Latinos, bynature, are very relationship-oriented, a collectivist society,the idea of self-help is notmuch out there. It's very com-mon to seek help; the differ-ence is from where you seekthat help.\" Montilla advises that \"be- coming part of the family\"should be a key goal in coun-seling Latino clients. \"It isfrom the family that we drawour strength, it is in familywhere we celebrate ourachievement and where welament our losses,\" he ex-plained. \"We get sick in family,and we get healed in family.You don't want to betray thefamily by telling a strangerabout your personal story andfamily struggles. When thecounselor becomes a familymember by offering an envi-ronment of trust and respect,they become more effective.\" \"It's not just two people com- ing together, but a communitycoming together,\" Montillacontinued. \"When you arecounseling in the U.S. and yousee one Latino [client] there,with that one person there are at least 10 people also present.They may not be in the room,but they very much are part ofthe person's life. You have tokeep that in mind when youcounsel people in the communi-ty.\" Global factors U.S.-based counselors en- countering a growing Latinoclient population should besensitive to the way economicchallenges are changing theLatino family structure. \"Thetraditional idea where the wifestays home and the husbandworks is not common any-more,\" Montilla said. \"The twoof them are working. It's notnegative in most cases. Manyenjoy the space. When theycome together they reconnectin a powerful way, but that is afactor that presents itself in thecounseling room.\" As a result, many clients come to Montilla facing maritalproblems, sexual dysfunction,anxiety disorders and disciplineissues with children. He alsoreports their openness to com-bine medications with counsel-ing treatment, as many Latinocounseling clients first ap-proach physicians for assis-tance with emotional problems. Montilla is writing a collec- tivist theory of human person-ality. He urges counselors to besensitive around issues of dif-ferentiation. \"If you read theclose connections of most Lati-no families through the tradi-tional theories of counseling,you might see pathologies,\" hesaid. \"For example, the motherwill check on the adult daugh-ter by calling three or fourtimes a day. Some people mightsay those people are enmeshedor fused. They might see that aspathology and then work hardto help this person differentiate,to individuate and to separatein order to become anautonomous person. But thatreally could be destructive towhat the person is all about.\" Consoli noted that economic globalization is changing LatinAmerican cultures as much asLatino immigrants are chang-ing the United States. \"In bothsituations, people are strug-gling with making sense of col-lectivist traditions running intocapitalistic values \u2014 the powerof one as the unit of analysis ascompared to the family as theunit of analysis,\" he said. \"Peo-ple are finding themselveschallenged by these changes.This creates more of a need forcounseling, but a counseling model that is not extreme inone way or another \u2014 not justcollectivist or just individualist.It has to be something that tran-scends that dichotomy.\" For a culture so devoted to family and community, effec-tive integration may be ahealthier goal than accultura-tion or assimilation. \"There'squite a bit of research indicatingthat the people who achievesome degree of integration tendto be better off across all kindsof health markers,\" Consolisaid. \"Integration is an affirma-tion to both \u2014 that is, my cul-ture of origin and my host cul-ture. My sense, and the sense ofthe task force, is an affirmationthat culture is not static. Cultureis an evolving phenomenon. Weare transforming each otherthrough our dialogue, and wecan't be the same afterward.\" ILatin America Continued from page 9 Stacy Notaras Murphy, a candidate for a master of science degree in pastoralcounseling at Loyola College inMaryland, is a counselingintern at PC&CC Washing-ton, D.C.

He often day-dreamed about the rainbow and constant-ly counted the colors. He just wanted tomake sure they were all there. Posttyeventually got suspended from school,but he didn't care. The teachers didn'tunderstand truth anyway, and this gavehim more free time to look for rainbows.Apparently, there was more than one. Hevery seldom found an actual rainbow andnever found one when someone was withhim. Truth is so allusive. In a nearby community lived a wise old counselor named Dickey Dog. For-tunately, Dr. Dickey Dog was widelyrespected for his rational thinking andhis understanding of the complexities oflife's truths. He had helped many dogsidentify their problem behavior and cor- rect their faulty thinking. At the urgingof numerous friends, Fem took Postty tosee if Dr. Dickey Dog could help him,too. Postty eagerly told Dr. Dickey Dog about the rainbow. Dr. Dickey Dog be-came very concerned and asked Postty ifanyone else had seen the rainbow. De-spondently, Postty said no. Dr. DickeyDog then asked Postty what kind of rain-bow it was. Postty explained that themiracle of a rainbow was too marvelousto classify. The doctor next asked Posttyabout his relationship with his friendsand how he was doing in school. Posttybecame embarrassed and quit talking. Hedid not like Dr. Dickey Dog very much.Rumor had it that Dr. Dickey Dog hadonce told a group of puppies that therewas no Santa Claus. Postty couldn'trespect anyone who didn't believe inSanta, regardless of how rational that dog's thinking was otherwise. After numerous tests and days of observation, Dr. Dickey Dog told Fem hewould give Postty a diagnosis. Posttyhad never had a diagnosis before \u2014 hedidn't even know he needed one. Posttyheard Dr. Dickey Dog say it had some-thing to do with four DSMs and a TR.Postty wasn't even aware that he had oneDSM and certainly didn't know how toget rid of them. The astute doctor contin-ued to explain that Postty was terrified ofstorms and might be suffering fromPTSD, which apparently had somethingto do with the four DSMs. Postty becamemore confused, but he admitted that hetruly was scared of storms until the dayhe saw the rainbow. Now he was notscared of storms at all. But he was afraidto argue with Dr. Dickey Dog. At last the judicious doctor convinced Fem that Postty was sick. He had a dis-eased brain and needed inpatient treat-ment. Fem objected to leaving Postty buteventually agreed to do whatever it tookto cure him. Postty didn't have a fever.He didn't feel sick, but he was just apuppy. What did he know? Dr. DickeyDog gave Postty the following diagnosis.

After many weeks of psychotherapy and psychotropic drugs, Dr. Dickey Dogproclaimed Postty cured. He no longersaw rainbows. It was true! Postty hadn't seen a rainbow the entire time he wasinside the clinic. He secretly thoughtnothing as wonderful as a rainbow couldever be found in such a dreadful place. Fem rejoiced at his recovery and ran and told all her friends. They had a bigwelcome home party for Postty. But Post-ty seemed different. He no longer ran,jumped or played. He no longer seemedfull of life. He was no longer that curiouslittle puppy who always explored newfrontiers in search of truth. The teachersat school liked Postty much better now,but Fem became concerned that Posttywas unhappy. Dr. Dickey Dog said it wasdepression and could be treated withSSRIs, unless psychotic features devel-oped. Postty was so tired of hearing aboutthe alphabet that he began to hate all let-ters. But at least Postty no longer sawrainbows. As time went by, Postty became sad- der and sadder. One rainy day, Femcame home and found a note from Post-ty. It said Postty was convinced that therainbow was hiding on the other side ofthe moon and he had gone to find it. Femcried. Weeks went by, then months and years. Fem longed for the day Postty wouldcome home again. Secretly she hoped hewould bring his rainbow with him. ButPostty never returned. Fem became sosad that she would stay up at night andstare at the moon. After a time she beganto howl at the moon in hopes that Posttywould hear her. Fem's friends became concerned about her. They decided Fem would be happierif they joined her when she howled at themoon. Someone said if enough dogshowled at the moon that Postty wouldhear them and come home. Fem surehoped it was true. In a few weeks, word had spread throughout doggy world that Postty wason the other side of the moon. Soon dogsall around the world began to howl at themoon in hopes that Postty would hearthem. Sometimes to this very day you canhear a dog howling at the moon. Whenyou do, remember the story about Posttyand his rainbow. IFinding Your Way Continued from page 15 N.

She also dis-covered that the Vietnamese cul-ture was perhaps not ready forher message or for the guidanceshe wanted to offer. In one situation, she asked a group she thought was well-versed in modern therapy tech-niques who Freud was \u2014 butshe got no response. In othercases, segments of the mentalhealth industry were combative.\"No one was really ready tohear what I had to say. But therewas beginning to be an inter-est,\" she said. \"Some peoplesaw the value in new ways ofdoing things.\" That interest in her ideas grew as she continued to visit Viet-nam. In 2001, when she finallymoved to Vietnam, she wasgaining attention both there andin the West. American Counsel-ing Association member Patri-cia Stevens, then chair of theCounseling Department at East-ern Kentucky University, wasone of several experts whoheard Zinman-Schwartz's mes-sage, saw her clinic in travels toVietnam,or learned about herthrough press coverage and thebooks and articles she was writ- ing. \"When we visited Vietnamfor an International CounselingConference in Ho Chi MinhCity,\" Stevens said, \"she askedus to come see her clinic. I wasincredibly impressed with whatshe was trying to do. We thenasked her to come to the confer-ence to talk about counseling inVietnam.\" Stevens knew that other cul- tures faced similar pressures, butVietnam \u2014 rocked by the warand the ensuing U.S. economicembargo \u2014 was now rapidlybeing thrust into a new age.\"They are so quickly faced withall the issues we have dealt withfor 50 to 60 years,\" Stevens said.\"We've sort of come full circlein how we handle things \u2014looking toward traditional tech-niques. They understand thosetechniques but probably needmore. Libby is trying to takewhat works in an Eastern cultureand combine it with what mightwork from the West.\" Stevens said it is both fascinat- ing and challenging work, notingthat Zinman-Schwartz faces thesame opposition to new therapytechniques or approaches in thisculture as counselors in Westerncultures have faced for ages.BY JIM PATERSON The startlingly tall, thin young Vietnamese man was standingnaked in the middle of a busycity street talking to himself asmotorcycles and bicycleswhizzed by him. Perhaps evenmore peculiar was the reactionfrom others \u2014 there was none. Libby Zinman-Schwartz was watching the man out the win-dow of the old French villa inVietnam's Ho Chi Minh Citywhere she was staying duringone of her several visits to betterunderstand the country's tradi-tional healing techniques. Theexperienced American therapistand counselor was surprised bythe reaction from the other peo-ple on the busy street. And whenshe called the authorities, she gota similar response. \"The police and the local hos- pital just told me, 'He is notharming anyone. Leave himalone.' No one felt they shouldbe involved. That incident be-came part of my mission to bringpsychotherapy to this country.\" What Zinman-Schwartz found in that event was the culture'savoidance of certain seriousmental illnesses. It spurred aneffort by her that was contrary to\u2014 and conveniently connectedwith \u2014 her first mission, whichhad been to learn and put to useVietnamese methods of helpingpeople with emotional pain.Now she was beginning to real-ize that this culture, which hadfor so long treated emotional dis-tress with its mixture of Confu-cianism and Buddhism, wasbeing turned upside down by theinfluence of Western culture.Ironically, perhaps, the treat-ments she revered and came tostudy were not enough. \"Traditional methods for the health of the mind and the bodythat stress things like rest anddiet and herbal remedies \u2014 andeven just principled ways ofbehaving with kindness andcompassion to others \u2014 arewhat I wanted to learn,\" she said.\"They are secrets that have beenpassed along through genera-tions, and they work so beauti-fully. However, for emotionaldisorders and for treatment ofthings like schizophrenia or depression, there is no Viet-namese frame of reference.There is no treatment in thiscountry that really addressesthese problems.\" So Zinman-Schwartz moved permanently to this SoutheastAsian nation that shares astrained and sad history with theUnited States and began theprocess of introducing certainWestern therapeutic techniquesthat she thought would help. Shespoke to the health communityand opened a free clinic wherethe first therapy of this typecould be practiced in Vietnam.Gradually, her voice began topenetrate deeper into the culture. Where it began In contrast to the subdued peo- ple of Vietnam whom she sowarmly describes, Zinman-Schwartz is intense and ex-citable. She is passionate aboutthe things she holds dear \u2014 mostnotably her work and the peopleof this \"amazing\" culture. Sherattles out sentences vigorouslyin rapid fire, skipping from topicto topic and hardly catching herbreath. There is little doubt thather advocacy would benefit herchosen cause. Zinman-Schwartz received her undergraduate degree and mas-ter's in literature in the early1960s. She earned her doctoratein education and her master's inpsychology in 1982. She wasalso interested in traditionalforms of healing and how theymight be used to deal with emo-tional distress. She visited othernations to learn more about theiruse, spending time in severalCentral American countries andin Mexico. In 1996 she went toVietnam and immediately wasdrawn to the people. \"I fell in love with them,\" she said. \"This is the most support-ive, warm and caring cultureI've seen in all my travels. Theyare artistically gifted and have ahigh level of emotional intelli-gence. There is so much that isso interesting and attractiveabout these people.\" While on that first visit she found that there was much to Continued on page 33 When East meets West In the course of her quest to uncover traditional healing techniques, Libby Zinman-Schwartz has also introduced Vietnam to a new approach to counseling AACE holds conference; seeks officer nominations Submitted by Brad Erford berford@loyola.edu The Association for Assess- ment in Counseling and Educa-tion held a very successfulThird Annual National Assess-ment Conference at the Univer-sity of Georgia Athens.Thomas Harrington andWilliam Sedlacek keynoted assessment andnoncognitive college admis-sions assessment, respectively.Final arrangements are underway to hold the next annualconference in fall 2006 (dateand location to be announced).A \"call programs\" form from Brad Erford(berford@loyola.edu AACE members are encour- aged to attend the breakfast, receptionsand business meeting theAmerican Counseling Associ-ation/Canadian inMontreal (March 30-April positions: (two years),member-at-large for member-ship (three years) and member-at-large for publications (threeyears).

AGLBIC to play host to marriage ceremony Submitted by John Marszalek John.Marszalek@SSRC.MsState .Edu The Board of the Association for Gay, Lesbian and BisexualIssues in Counseling is pleasedto announce that AGLBIC willhost a same-sex marriage cere-mony on April 1 at theACA/CCA Convention inMontreal. A reception will fol-low the ceremony. All gay andlesbian couples who would liketo participate in the ceremonyshould contact President-ElectBrian Dew no later than Feb.15 at bdew@gsu.edu . AGLBIC is hiring a wed- ding organizer and officiant inMontreal who will handle alllegal paperwork for couples,including the filing of all mar-riage applications in Canada.Couples will be mailed a shortquestionnaire to complete andwill need to provide the wed-ding organizer with the re-quired information for thepaperwork. Couples are notrequired to arrive early to meetwith legal officials. Although AGLBIC cannot afford to pay for each couple'spaperwork and the officiant, itwill be funding the weddingreception and ceremony (e.g.,music, decorations and loca-tion). The cost for each couplewill depend on the number ofcouples who participate in theceremony. If five to 10 cou-ples participate, the cost willbe $400 Canadian dollars (ap-proximately $345 in U.S. cur-rency); if less than five cou-ples participate, the cost percouple will be $450 Canadiandollars (approximately $388in U.S. currency). Taxes arenot included in this price. Thiscost may seem somewhatexpensive. However, if a cou-ple went directly to the court-house in Montreal, it wouldcost them nearly $275, whichwould not include the paper-work submission, finding anofficiant and meeting earlywith legal officials.If you have any questions or if you would like to make adonation to help fund the cere-mony, please contact Presi-dent-Elect Brian Dew atbdew@gsu.edu or President Joy Whitman at jwhitman @depaul.edu .

In counsel-ing, humanistic approachesseek to understand more fullywhat it means to be human andexplore ways in which thisunderstanding can better thequality of human life. Human-istic counselors place greatvalue on the dignity and worthof all humans and the fullbreadth of human potential.They represent a holisticunderstanding of humanityand encourage the utilizationof the fullest breadth of humancapacity. The attraction of counselors to a wellness orientationevolves quite naturally fromthe humanistic roots that haveserved as an important founda-tion for modern counselingapproaches and initiatives. Awellness mindset establishesthe common ground betweenclient and counselor as eachtraverses the highs and lowsthat are part of the humanexperience. Neither is immuneto struggles, nor are theyexempt from the joys of suc-cess. Human pathways aremany, and each path is ladenwith twists and turns. Human-istic counselors embrace notonly the final destination butalso the journey itself.

EB-ACA provides review of conference Learning Institute Submitted by Peggy Krauss peggy.krauss@us.army.mil The majority of us attending the Learn- ing Institute on \"Counseling Aggressiveand Addicted Men\" at the annual confer-ence of the European Branch of ACA onNov. 5-6, 2005, nodded our heads in affir-mation that we are seeing many clientswith ineffective coping skills for anger.Nearly 30 Learning Institute attendeesbettered their understanding of angerdynamics, or what co-presenter Dave Jol-liff called the \"ego-driven power strug-gle.\" We heard many examples of howour community appears to be expressingits aggression. We compared similar sto-ries and expressed our concerns about theincrease of serious substance abuse bysoldiers returning to the battlefield for asecond time. We also discussed strategiesfor helping clients reframe their cognitivedistortions and examine their own rela-tionships and early influences. According to our presenters, a male child's very first experience kick-starts theprocess of environmental assimilation. Inco-presenter Andy Horne's research, heproposes a model to explain male transi-tion points and the major influences atthese times. Following are the negativerisk factors that appear to be at the core ofthe individual's personality development: INurturers \u2014 Missing an intimate fatherbond often results in a fear of intimacy.Self-reliance is reinforced continuallydue to the lack of connection. Ego satis-faction is gained and nurtured withoutlearning to cooperate with others. IRole models \u2014 When the child seekinga separate identity from his parents val-ues poor role modeling, the result canbecome rigidity in thought and action.Fantasy images of masculinity oftenbegin to color choices and preferences. IInitiators \u2014 With societal emphasis on \"initiations\" into manhood, such as glo-rification of binge drinking or antisocialbehavior as seen in gang identification,the risk increases for failure to developappropriate internal controls. IMentors \u2014 Failure to accept a guidinghand to learn how to appropriately copewith success, as well as disappointment,can result in development of stress.Young adults express such frustrationthrough anger, further distancing them-selves from others. IElders \u2014 Men who are unable to suc-cessfully internalize the knowledge andwisdom gained from others at this stagemay become self-centered. This qualityis often translated into perfectionism.Anger develops when the person isfaced with an incongruent reality. Jolliff reminded attendees that \"claim- ing the emotion is secondary to external-izing the cause\" for angry men. The pre-senters provided additional models to suc-cessfully teach angry and addicted menhow to recognize their feelings and toavoid the trap of blaming others. Our presenters explained that anger is also a cover for unhappiness. They rea-soned that men often hide their depressionand dissatisfaction while easily express-ing their anger. Violence becomes themagnification of the tension released fromthese hidden emotions. A reward cycledevelops after the energy is expended,which becomes self-reinforcing. Inter-rupting this cycle by holding our clientsresponsible for their feelings is integralfor the healing process to begin.

Thedemanding world of planners,e-mail and cell phones make itdifficult to live in the moment,so the lesson must be continual-ly relearned. I once saw a sign that read, \"You have to get out to get alife.\" I've found one of the keyelements for living in themoment is to get out and havean adventure each day. Thedebilitating thing about home-work, phone calls, e-mails andto-do lists is that they are con-tinually beckoning for you todeal with them. I am by nomeans advocating not doingyour homework, but I havelearned to prioritize times forboth my school life and person-al life. Sometimes it's necessaryto just do life with family,friends, the dog or even aloneby yourself. I have also learned to set pri- orities, because living in themoment means recognizing thatI can't do it all. Some daysdoing things with the family is the priority; other days thehomework must get done. Mychildren have taught me that ondays when homework mustcome first, it all goes muchsmoother if I tell them inadvance. They appreciate beingin the loop and included as partof the solution. Then there arethose days when family comesfirst. Often that means takingthem to where the laptop can nolonger lure me away. Just seeingthe laptop gets me thinkingabout school and distracts mefrom my family, so findingways to keep it out of my sightduring these family times isessential. Recognizing thosemoments when I \"have to getout\" has been enormouslyimportant in breaking my preoc-cupation with work and conse-quently missing preciousmoments with my family. Whenthat happens, no one is happy \u2014especially me. We do a lot of journaling in graduate school (that is proba-bly an understatement). Startingthe program, I never imaginedhow much self-reflection I would be doing. It was veryhard to do in the beginningwhen I just wanted to read abook, learn the principles andapply them. But journaling'svalue grew on me over time andhelped me learn to live in themoment. When thoughts andfears about the future crop up, Ijournal them. Writing thosethoughts on paper somehowgives them focus and gets me intouch with what I can do in thehere and now to deal with them.The process has helped me bepresent for my husband, chil-dren and dog instead of exhaus-tively ruminating on the future.Journaling has provided ahaven, a place for me to go anddo all my worrying so I can geton with life in the present. There was a time when I mis- takenly thought that living inthe moment meant not evaluat-ing or effectively planning forthe future. What I have actuallyfound is that living in themoment helps me balance myprofessional journey by think-ing about the future and actingin the present. There were many times previously when I hadbeen so lost in the future that Imissed out on what I couldlearn about myself and the fieldI love. Journaling has aided mein keeping those things in per-spective. Now as thoughts ariseduring the day, I journal, andleave the thoughts on paper.This process helps me to actrather than to ruminate andallows me to be present for thepeople and life that I love at theend of the day. Living in the moment has kept both of my passions alive,but I've found that I must con-sistently choose to live in thepresent. And that is the final keyelement \u2014 choice. Actively liv-ing in the moment through thechoices I make is what quietsthe internal struggle betweenmy passions. This is a new wayof thinking for me. It demandscontinually asking myself, \"Areyou living in the moment rightnow with your children, yourhusband and yourself?\" I hopemy professional journey will seta good and realistic example formy children. I used to believe that once your passion in life was found,the hard part was over. But thathas not proved true. The morepassions you add to your life'sequation, the more complicatedit becomes. My life wouldn't bethe same without my family,and I will be a better counselorand hopefully a better counseloreducator because of them. Theyencourage me to strive for the\"golden ring\" yet help me toremember what is ultimatelyimportant at the end of the day.Yes, the constant comings andgoings of a passionate life canbe exhausting, but just as waterrefreshes, this movement of lifealso energizes me \u2014 as long asI remember to live in the present Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 29Student Focus Continued from page 7 Rebecca Koltz ( koltzr@ uwstout.edu ) is a graduate student at the University ofWisconsin-Stout.

They decid-ed to limit the trip to seven days,reasoning that a two-week timecommitment was too difficult,especially given that the tripwas to take place in the middleof the semester and most partic-ipants were part-time studentswith jobs and family obliga-tions. \"Our idea was to do a nation- al pilot to see if this would workand perhaps open the door forother teams from other universi-ties,\" Bemak said. \"We all want-ed see if somethingthat was viable.\" Bemak alsocoordinated with the Mississip-pi Department of Mental Heathand the local Substance Abuseand Mental Health ServicesAdministration team. After the dates were finally nailed down, 14 of the 35 stu-dents who had originally ex-pressed interest committed togo. Bemak and Chung held anorientation on disaster work toinform the students about whatthey might encounter. After-ward, they gave the students theoption of changing their mindabout the trip, given that thework would be both mentallyand physically taxing. All 14students stuck by their commit-ment. The two supervising fac-ulty members and the studentswent to the campus computerroom and purchased their airlinetickets online that day. \"What was very interesting was that the other students inour program, because of oursocial justice mission, werevery willing to support this,\"Bemak said, adding that a num-ber contributed money and vol-unteered to pet or house-sitwhile their fellow students wereaway. Several pitched in by dri-ving their peers to the airport inBaltimore or loaning digitalcameras and video camcordersto those going on the mission.Bemak and Chung spoke totheir fellow faculty members,asking if they would be flexiblewith deadlines and tests for thestudents who were volunteer-ing. Again, the response waspositive. \"We had a whole grad-uate program community ofcaring,\" he said. \"Everyonejumped in to support it. Even avery well-known faculty mem-ber in the psychology depart- ment offered to buy us T-shirtsto show who we were.\" The T-shirts helped identify the stu-dents among the hundreds ofaid and relief workers in thecenters and shelters. Before leaving, team members met again for intense training indisaster relief counseling, usingmaterials from ACA, SAMHSAand the American Red Cross inaddition to the experiences oftheir two supervisors. The deployment The Mississippi Department of Health, which hadn't origi-nally been disposed to acceptingnonlicensed volunteers, was onboard and supporting theGeorge Mason University team.The director and workers ofProject Recovery, a govern-ment-funded state mental healthprogram, met team members atthe airport upon their arrival inMississippi and drove them tothe coast. \"That, to us, symbolized that there was a great need that theyare not able to serve with theresources they have,\" Bemaksaid. \"They welcomed thisteam, even though the studentswere not licensed. It was a veryspecial moment they createdbecause we were not the tradi-tional, licensed, two-weekteam.\" Frazier had arranged for the team to stay in tents outside alocal church. However, a freakcold snap sent temperaturesplunging into the 30s. TheSAMHSA team contactedBemak while en route to say itwas working to find an alter-nate location for the students tostay. When team membersarrived, they were told theycould stay in the same locationas the SAMHSA team \u2014 in asecure treatment facility formale adolescents. \"There was barbed wire and several locks and codes we hadto go through to get to our area,\"Bemak said. \"We had a buildingto ourselves because the facilitywas not full.\" Still, the quarterswere far from comfortable.Bemak slept in an isolationroom with little more than amattress on the floor. The stu-dents bunked up in pairs, mak-ing the best of the situation andtrying to prepare for the eventsto come. Katrina fatigue For the next week, the stu- dents were split up and scatteredalong the Mississippi coast at seven shelters and disasterresponse centers. Frazier ar-ranged for rental cars so stu-dents could drive back and forthto the locations. Cell phoneswere also donated so studentscould stay in contact withBemak and Chung. Most of the people the team members approached welcomedthe invitation to talk. At first,Bemak said, the students were abit hesitant about just going upand talking to those affected bythe hurricane. But by the end ofthe trip, they had seen 591clients. Chung and Bemakroamed from facility to facility,navigating piles of debris andnameless streets to make suretheir students were all right. \"(Team members) worked across ethnicities and races,facilitated dialog among thosein different ethnic backgroundsand had mini group sessions \u2014informally \u2014 as people andfamilies waited in lines for aid,\"Bemak said. \"We could havetripled our numbers and still notseen all those who needed help.The stories are profound. Thefrustration is endless. The men-tal health issues there are esca-lating. They call it Katrinafatigue.\" Every night after dinner, the group met for two to three hoursto debrief and share their experi-ences. They discussed victims'stories that had touched them aswell as their own emotions andstruggles. The counselor super-visors talked about specificinterventions and helpful skillsthe students could use. \"Every night they cried,\" Bemak said. \"They weremoved and pained by the sto-ries, but they grew significantlyas counselors.\" Many of thestudents stated that the experi-ence was different from any oftheir previous training, he said.According to Bemak, everystudent said they would haveagreed to stay through theThanksgiving holiday to help ifthey had known the true levelof need that still existed monthsafter the hurricane. \"They allsaid that it was a life-changingexperience,\" he said. On to Capitol Hill Since returning, the team has contacted government officialsand is scheduled to meet withmembers of Congress to furtherfocus attention on the need toprovide ongoing mental healthservices to the hurricane vic-tims. The aim is to create anational program with funding for other schools to send teamsof counseling students to theGulf Coast. \"There is so much devastation and everything is destroyed,\"Bemak said. \"We weren't awareof how bad it is and how hope-less and hurt a number of thepeople are. After the experience,we want to bring that awarenessback. The situation warrants acompletely different responsethan what we have been doing.The needs are far greater thanthe kinds of interventions we aremaking. We need to make amajor shift in how we approachit. One of those shifts can be ledby teams from universitiesgoing down there with graduatestudents and supervisors.\" Counselors in progress Following are the stories of two of the counseling graduatestudents who volunteered to goto Mississippi: Kelly Badger \"I was nervous to make the decision to go down to Missis-sippi due to us not knowingexactly what our role would be,(but) it was something that I justhad to do. You come acrossopportunities in your life thatyou make a personal connectionwith and it just feels right. It wasone of those situations. The peo-ple down there are in need, andI have the ability to go downand try and make a difference insome way.\" Badger was apprehensive about her ability to provideeffective trauma and disasterrelief counseling, even with herprofessors on hand to supervise.\"I knew that this would not bethe same type of counseling thatI have been doing as apracticum student in schoolcounseling, but my apprehen-sions were in not knowing whatthis type of counseling lookedlike. We read articles and metwith Dr. Bemak to discuss situ-ations we might come acrossand how to best handle them, but nothing can make you feelfully prepared. You learn to trustyour gut and believe that youhave the skills as well as theheart to help these people.\" After speaking to individuals affected by Katrina and hearingtheir stories, her concerns fadedand her professional skills andconfidence grew. The mostchallenging part for her wasdealing with the emotionsinvolved in this type of work. \"I don't think you can ever be fully prepared to experience theimpact that this devastation hason you, especially when you areworking so closely with theindividuals that it has impacted.It was crucial that we processwhat we had experienced to-gether at night back at basecamp because we were so busyduring the day, I never had achance to really feel what wasimpacting me and what effect itwould have on me.\" Badger was deeply touched that the individuals she talked tofelt comfortable enough to sharesuch private and painful storieswith her. \"Some individualswould hug you and tell you thatyou had made a difference tothem. With some individuals,you could tell a difference intheir demeanor toward the endof our time together. Some I willnever know if I made an impactat all, but I am confident thatthere were people I touched,people that feel reaffirmed andfeel heard because of me, andthat is the most rewarding gift Ihave ever received.\" One aspect that Badger said doesn't get much media cover-age is the fact that all the hurri-cane victims had some sort ofpersonal struggle or issue \u2014 nomatter how normal or ordinary\u2014 before Katrina hit; the stormjust exacerbated their pre-exist-ing problems. In addition, shesaid, life issues that residentsdealt with prior to Katrina, suchas health care, domestic vio-lence, poverty and discrimina-tion, are still there. People con-Counselors without borders Continued from page 1 Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 31tinue to deal with these issues, but they are now combined witha lack of shelter, food, clothing,jobs and overall security. \"They have life events that continue to happen and contin-ue to affect them in addition tothe devastation that they arefaced with (from the hurri-cane). One individual that real-ly opened my eyes to this was aman who had found out that hewas terminal and that his doc-tors were no longer going toactively fight the cancer in hisbody.\" He had learned this sev-eral days before talking withBadger but hadn't told his fam-ily because he didn't want toburden them. \"He said he didn't want to put anything else on their plate.He thanked me for listeningand told me how good it felt toget it out and to tell someone. Ican't tell you what a gift it wasfor him to trust me enough totell me such a personal storyand to feel safe enough in ourinteraction to do so.\" The experience has changed Badger professionally as wellas personally. \"I am definitely adifferent counselor, but evenmore so a different human being. These people have beensuch an inspiration for me.They are so strong and soresilient.\" She felt connected to those with whom she spoke and feelsa responsibility to do whatevershe can to continue providingsupport. \"This is going to take asignificant amount of time toheal. These people are in pain,they are frustrated, they areangry, and at the same time theyare proud and are full of internalresources that push themthrough. People I spoke withwere so thankful for our pres-ence in their community. Thereis a true need for continued sup-port from the mental healthcommunity.\" Badger encourages other graduate students to establishCounselors Without Bordersprograms and to volunteer in theGulf Coast region. \"You will notregret a moment of it. It is hard,it is emotional, it is draining.But it is all worth it. We weretold that this would be thetoughest work we might everdo, and I can say without adoubt it has been, but it has alsobeen the most rewarding experi- ence to date. I would not tradethat week of my life for any-thing.\" Marla Zometsky With all the discussion sur- rounding what Gulf Coast resi-dents need and how many ofthose needs are going unmet,Marla Zometsky thought it wasimportant for her, as a futurecounselor, to serve in a helpingcapacity. \"Particularly as some-one who can listen to their con-cerns, show that people do careabout what is happening to themand try to raise awareness thatthere is still a great need forassistance in this region, includ-ing mental health assistance.\"She also wanted to go for theeducational opportunity. \"Pro-fessionally, my reason for pur-suing a graduate degree in coun-seling was an interest in traumacounseling, and this project wasa great opportunity to personal-ly help those impacted by thehurricane and to obtain directcrisis counseling experience. Icould not have had a betterchance to learn while doing.\" She tried to prepare herself forthe destruction, but witnessing it in person was surreal, especiallywhen she saw small personalitems such as photos or booksamid piles of rubble that oncewere homes. \"Knowing thatmany of those I spoke with werestill \u2014 three months out fromthe hurricane \u2014 living in theircars, in shelters and in tents,(and) feeling that this was unac-ceptable and due to a true lackof political will on a grand scale,was personally challenging inthat I could not make the systemwork better for them in thatmoment. Person after personexpressed their frustration, fearand weariness trying to obtainshelter or trying to remain intheir current shelter until theirtrailer or more permanent hous-ing came through.\" She also struggled with the fact that once the GMU teamleft, no one would be there tocontinue providing needed men-tal health services. \"On my finalday, it was a challenge to leavethe DRC (disaster response cen-ter) knowing that another men-tal health worker would not bereturning the next day, that theywere needed and that furtherplans for their deployment were still under consideration. As Iwas leaving on the final day,one of the FEMA (FederalEmergency ManagementAgency) employees asked if Iwas returning soon and whethersomeone else would come thefollowing day. I had to acknowl-edge that I didn't know whenanother mental health workerwould come, but we were work-ing on it. That was difficult.While I tried to give them hope,I couldn't promise anything.\" Zometsky said many of the same people and families re-turned to the centers daily forassistance and to ensure theirinformation was kept up to date.Their anxiety, sadness and frus-tration levels were nearing theirlimits, and the student coun-selors tried their best to draw ontheir counseling skills and limit-ed experience to defuse the situ-ations any way they could. \"While I wasn't able to help them with their immediategoals, such as obtaining shelter,I was able to give them anempathetic ear and help themthink through their next steps Continued on page 32the young counselor's surprise, the woman replied, \"You are right! I havegotten a lot done!\" Zometsky said, \"Although she was still distressed, by the time it was her turn tomeet with the caseworker, she seemed tobe thinking more clearly and could pre-sent her information in a coherent man-ner.\" As the mother spoke to the FEMAcaseworker, Zometsky sat and talkedwith the daughter. The mother hadreferred to the daughter as \"resilient,\"and Zometsky asked the teen what shethought of this. \"The young woman felt it was not true and began to cry. She was still mourningthe loss of her father, who died a yearago. She shared with me how she hadlost the only things she had thatremained of him. Her friends were nowscattered across the country. She didn'tknow how to contact them. She feltalone and as if no one, including hermother, understood her. We talked aboutwhat that was like for her and how shewas dealing with all this loss. She toldme that she wrote music. I respondedthat she must be very talented and askedif she wrote about her feelings. She saidthat she did, but that people did not knowthey were her feelings. Again, I told herhow impressed I was and that sheseemed like such a unique and talentedyoung lady.\" Zometsky said that throughout her time with the daughter, she simply reflectedthe feelings she heard the girl express.That was all the girl needed to continueher story and feel that someone under-stood what she was going through. \"At one point this young lady asked if I was a counselor. I told her I was a'wanna-be' counselor and that I was intraining.\" The girl laughed at her jokeand told Zometsky she had talked withcounselors before but did not like them.However, she liked talking with Zometsky. \"I felt honored that we made a connec- tion, and I shared that with her andthanked her.\" Zometsky also gave thedaughter a list of hotlines she could callin the future if she wanted to talk tosomeone. \"I was touched by the entireexperience with that family. I spoke withthis young lady for approximately 45minutes. During the last 15 minutes, Ihad noticed that the mother had complet-ed her meeting with the caseworker.However, she sat several rows behind usin order to let her daughter continue talk-ing.\" Both the mother and daughterhugged Zometsky and thanked her forlistening. Though she made them feelbetter, Zometsky is under no illusion thatthe stress and anxiety the mother firstexpressed are permanently gone. Howev-er, for the brief time she spent with themother, Zometsky was able to help heraccomplish her tasks at the DRC in amore productive and calm manner. \"Furthermore, this young lady was able to express her sadness and not pre-tend that everything was OK. She had been feeling like no one cared about herand that she was alone. For a brief timeshe met with a stranger who allowed herto share how she felt, empathized withher and thought she was important. As afuture counselor, I have a new under-standing about what it means to be fullypresent and work in the moment. I havea new appreciation for the basic coun-seling skills \u2014 reflecting, paraphrasingand attending \u2014 and the enormousimpact they have on the clients and ourrelationship.\" Like Badger, Zometsky wants coun- selors and counseling students to beaware that a great need remains forcounseling volunteers in the Gulf Coast.\"I would also like disaster relief organi-zations and mental health associationssuch as the American Counseling Asso-ciation to know that graduate counselingstudents are an untapped resource thatshould be utilized,\" Zometsky said.\"The people in the Gulf Coast need ourhelp, and we as counseling traineesshould not be excluded when imple-menting a large-scale mental health cri-sis-counseling plan. Doing so con-tributes to a system that has left thou-sands of the affected without mentalhealth respite. Graduate counseling stu-dents can help fill the need. I believe thecounseling profession has an obligationto do everything possible to help fill thisdeficit, and recruiting graduate counsel-ing students is one option. Furthermore,it provides students with the hands-onexperience that will make them bettercounselors and future leaders in thesocial justice counseling movement.\" Zometsky continued, \"We need to fight Katrina fatigue. Do not be fooled intothinking that things are all better. Whilethis may be true for some, and I am grate-ful for the progress already made, thereare thousands and thousands that are stillwithout basic human services and whoare fearful for their future. We'll see themental health impact of Katrina for yearsto come.\" For more information on establishing a Counselors Without Borders programwith counseling student volunteers, con-tact Fred Bemak at fbemak@gmu.edu .

I tried to reinforce the per- sonal strengths I heard them express, givethem the opportunity to convey theiremotions and just simply be there forthem in those moments.\" She said sever-al FEMA workers, many of whom werefrom the affected areas and also dealingwith loss, relied on the mental healthworkers and asked them to speak directlywith distraught persons. In one such case, a FEMA worker asked Zometsky to speak with an incred-ibly anxious and distraught mother andher 14-year-old daughter. \"She was inline to learn the status of her travel trailer;her family was currently living in a shel-ter. I walked up and asked if I could sitnext to her. Before I could even finish mysentence asking how she was, she startedtelling me how worried she was that theshelter they were in would close and thatshe and her family would literally be liv-ing on the street. This wasn't an unfound- ed fear, as the previous two shelters theywere placed in had closed. This familyhad lost everything \u2014 their home, theirbelongings and their security. They hadno permanent place to live, and she hadanother child, a son, with Tourette's syn-drome. She was deeply concerned withhow a lack of structure and security wasaffecting her children.\" The women was so upset, she could hardly breathe at times, Zometsky said. \"Igently placed my hand on hers and askedher if we could take a deep breath togeth-er. She had so many things to take care ofand so much to worry about that every-thing was overwhelming her. So wewalked through each step she would takewhile at the DRC today. I reflected herfeelings and summarized the incredibleamount of work that she had alreadyaccomplished in such a short time.\" To Angela Kennedy is a senior writer at Counseling Today .

BACP has disbanded its RACE (Race and Cultural Education) division,given that the work and recommenda-tions of this group have been achievedand become ingrained into everydaypractice.\" Trauma counseling is also a high- priority issue in the United Kingdom,due in large part to the terrorist bomb-ings last year in London and to a stringof natural disasters around the world,including the Indian Ocean tsunami. \"Another subject is the rights and responsibilities, both legal and moral, ofyoung people,\" Jamieson said. \"Ageismand mental health is a very big issue inthe U.K. at present. Many older peoplesuffer from depression, and the 50-plusage group is one of the high-risk suicidegroups. Many mental health servicesignore older people's emotional needsand do not actively treat older people fordepression. The public is becoming much more aware of older people's mentalhealth issues, particularly treatable disor-ders such as anxiety and depression.\" Another issue that is starting to become widely discussed in both theUnited States and the United Kingdom isself-harm and self-mutilation. \"Self-harm is a very big issue in the U.K. atpresent,\" Jamieson said. \"Recent reportssuggest that up to one in 10 teenagersself-harm, and it is a very specializedarea for counselors. It seems that thisworrying trend is on the increase, and itwill be necessary for many more coun-selors to train in this area.\" Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 33 leads a team of 82 staff members to man- age the association's daily operations. \"BACP offers accreditation for individ- ual counselors and psychotherapists,supervisors and training courses,\" saidBACP Deputy Chief Executive AlanJamieson. \"Accreditation involves theassessment of practitioner training, super-vised practice, professional and personaldevelopment, theory and casework.Applicants complete an application formand provide a report from their currentsupervisor and ask for someone to pro-pose their application. Once submitted, anapplication is first checked for eligibility,and once this is achieved, at least twoassessors conduct a full assessment.BACP has procedures in place for ongo-ing quality assurance which apply to thisprocess.\" He noted that BACP also holdsthe United Kingdom Register of Counsel-lors. \"BACP is very much concerned withstandards and with public protection,\" Jamieson said. \"To this end, BACP is veryactively engaged in discussions with thegovernment on plans for the statutory leg-islation of counseling, psychotherapy andpsychologies \u2014 commonly called thepsychological therapies.\" Hot topics Regulation and standardized licensure are controversial topics in the UnitedKingdom, just as they are in the UnitedStates. Another major topic of interest inthe United Kingdom is diversity,Jamieson said, which encompasses itemsranging from disability and multicultur-alism to gay/lesbian issues and socialinclusion/social justice. \"The concept of multiculturalism is to a large extent widely accepted,\" he said,\"and diverse groups are well catered for inthe U.K., especially in relation to counsel- Along with that, she faces a culture steeped in a very different tradition. But Zinman-Schwartz has made in- roads, and her ideas have taken root andgained ground. She has been the onlyboard-certified Western counselor operat-ing privately in Vietnam and has served asa consultant for Western clinics and hospi-tals. For the first time in the country's his-tory, she offered training in Western psy-chotherapy at a local university. She hasalso gathered research on the relationshipbetween Vietnamese culture and psycho-logical disorders. In addition, Zinman-Schwartz has be- come a popular speaker at universities andhospitals and was recently asked to headthe Department of Psychotherapy in anew building at the Ho Chi Minh Univer-sity of Medicine and Pharmacology, oneof the nation's most prestigious schools.Her free clinic, which she operates fromher home, has also expanded, with facili-ties at a military hospital and a pediatricclinic. And more than 200 people attend-ed a two-part conference she sponsoredlast June. The approach Zinman-Schwartz came to understand that the Vietnamese culture might benefitfrom a new, unique way of counseling.\"There was not a psychological approachhere,\" she said. \"They had never seen psy-chotherapy practices. Some were fascinat-ed by the field, but no one had seen it.There was no infrastructure for it.\" But she also understood that the culture had traditions that were strong and potent.\"The family is at the center of Vietnameselife, and they all live together,\" she said.\"In that environment, children are nur-tured in this incredible way. There is noth-ing better for a child than that sort of nur-turing.\" She found some aspects of the cul-ture that she didn't like \u2014 a tradition ofphysical violence against women and chil-dren, for instance \u2014 but Zinman- Schwartz said the culture's mix of Bud-dhism and Confucianism generally createshappy, emotionally healthy people. However, she also discovered that more difficult issues needed additional attention\u2014 for instance, serious mental illnessessuch as schizophrenia and depression, aswell as issues resulting from the influenceof Western culture, including divorce and,among adolescents, drug abuse and sui-cide. Those problems got Zinman-Schwartz's attention, but she was deter-mined to treat them with respect for Viet-namese society's traditions. \"My Vietnamese student counselors and I have learned how to promote Westernideas with a deep and mindful respect forEastern values,\" she said, noting that sheoften uses and trains her staff in a few sim-ple techniques. Thus far she has trainedfive student counselors, and three more arein the process of being trained. \"There arehundreds waiting,\" Zinman-Schwartzsaid, \"but I still do not have the large roomI need to train with a one-way mirror andan audio hookup.\" She said clients are often receptive to new approaches to their problems andconstructive suggestions because their cul-ture treats authority and education sorespectfully. \"Vietnamese culture has alevel of politeness and generosity I'venever seen anywhere else,\" she said.\"When they learn about our approach,without exception, every client agrees.\" That counseling approach is something Zinman-Schwartz stumbled upon, but shenow believes it works particularly well inVietnamese society. She sits in on sessionsheld by her new counselors, along withother students and interpreters. She oftenoffers comments or seeks information dur-ing the sessions so that the new counselorscan receive direction and observing stu-dents can learn about the counselingprocess. They can also interject. \"While the translators were excellentEuropean flavor Continued from page 19 East meets West Continued from page 25 and I felt that I was well aware of the client-therapist communication processtaking place in front of me, eventually Ibecame more impatient and wanted tocheck what the client had said beforethe counselor responded,\" Zinman-Schwartz said. She began interveningwith questions and encouraged otherstudents to do likewise, especially whenclients proved comfortable with thepractice. \"The (counseling) model fused with the Vietnamese family and cultural life,\"she said. \"The extended family and trustit engenders is a foundation of Viet-namese life and social security. We sim-ply fit ourselves into that existing cultur-al construct of tolerance for inclusion ofothers. The shifting from one counselorto another and the different personalityof each prompts clients to react andreveal to us behavior we might not haveotherwise noted. What evolved is aprocess related to 'team theory' andother techniques that have been success-ful in group therapy. It was well suitedin Vietnam because of the critical linkby individuals to their families.\"Because of those strong ties to family, counselors often must introduce conceptssuch as countertransference, internalizingand interjecting parental figures and atti-tudes, Zinman-Schwartz said. Addition-ally, parents in Vietnamese culture fre-quently are excessively dependent ontheir children and overly involved in theirdevelopment, which can cause distress toboth parties. In addition, Zinman-Schwartz said, the counselors must try to combat onesignificant cultural problem \u2014 anunwillingness to express themselves.The counselors often simply attempt toget clients to be more open with theirfeelings. \"It is a process of seeing what works from both cultures and putting it to use,\"she said. \"And our clients are very com-fortable with that approach. It works.\" IAngela Kennedy is a senior writer at Counseling Today . Send comments about this article to akennedy@ counseling.org . Jim Paterson is a high school counselorand writer living in Olney, Md. Contacthim at T oday IJanuary 2006 34I became a counselor first as a volunteer trainer for an AIDSservice organization, then par-ticipated in a research study onmother-to-child transmission ofHIV wherein I had to pretestand post-test counsel them. Irealized how needed counselingservices in my country were,particularly because of theHIV/AIDS pandemic. In Zim-babwe, one in four adults is pre-sumed infected with the HIVvirus. I also became the univer-sity counselor and later devel-oped a popular bachelor of sci-ence counseling program. Before we stepped in with a baccalaureate counselor pro-gram, counseling was some-thing a psychologist, socialworker, nurse or the clergy didas an added responsibility withvery little professional coun-selor training given. A Tavistocksystemic counseling organiza-tion offered some training. Oth-erwise, counseling is largely inthe hands of family members,paraprofessionals and volunteerworkers. This has tended to rel-egate counseling as a garden-variety activity \u2014 somethinganyone can do. Most people in Zimbabwe do not seek counseling as under-stood in the West except forHIV/AIDS counseling. Fiveyears ago, those who soughtcounseling were the elite, butbecause we have counselortraining at all levels of the com-munity, in rural and urban areas,and in schools (peer counsel-ing), the demand for counselingservice is on the upswing. Wehad our first 509 B.S. counsel-ing graduates whom we trainedby distance learning who arenow trying to raise the bar forprofessional counselor services.We have enrolled over fiveyears at our open and distancelearning university, to date,almost 2,500 students \u2014 obvi-ously a phenomenal growthwith its own challenges. This isour attempt to professionalizecounseling and to advocate for amore equitable service for all. Iam currently collaborating withmy former students to establisha professional counselor associ-ation that is recognized by ourgovernment. There is a lot that counselors do to impact on lives in Zimbab-we. The mortality rate, especial-ly of the 15-to-49 age groups, isso high, the economy is at itslowest for various reasons, un-employment is unbelievablyhigh and the cost of living isbeyond everyone. I have alreadymentioned the devastating ef-fects of the HIV/AIDS pandem- ic, which is worsened by un-availability or shortage of costlydrugs. Counseling services areessential given such dismal con-ditions, which have eroded thecoping abilities of most people.The burnout to counselingproviders is also high. There is asense of hopelessness all round.Our situation easily compareswith the U.S. during the Depres-sion years, (but) unfortunatelywith very limited resources tobreak the vicious hold on lives. Ibelieve counseling gives manypeople hope and reinforces theircoping resources. I work withrape survivors and HIV/AIDSaffected and infected peoplewho have told me how even onesession of counseling makesthem face the future withcourage. In fact, counseling isclosely identified with HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe, probablyaccounting for the demand forits services here. The strength of the counseling profession lies with the coun-selors themselves. They arevery dedicated people who havegreedily acquired counselingskills and have not been afraidto practice wherever they areneeded, even without being paidfor their sterling services.Unfortunately, the resources forsupervision of practitioners arevery limited. There is no accred-iting body to oversee practice,but our graduates are heavilyinducted into the ethical guidesadapted from the U.K. andU.S.A. Counseling strength inmy country lies also in how cul-ture-specific it has becomebecause, like Christianity, it hasevolved to accommodate theneeds of the people. Research incounseling practice is still weak.There are many studies onHIV/AIDS counseling that havehelped to inform practice. That,I hope, will spill over into otherareas of counseling. The first challenge is to improve on our image of beingundervalued as professionals.We are not paid for our servicesin the same way a clinical psy-chologist is. We still have toconvince our market that weshould be paid at commensuraterates for our services. We haveto vigorously lobby for recogni-tion as professionals with ourgovernment. It is important to be part of the global village, including incounseling. We need to partici-pate at international counselingforums where we can share ourexperiences. I was particularlyoverwhelmed with awe when Iinteracted with professional counselors at the last ACA Con-vention in Atlanta in 2005. Ihope we will be able to forgemore links between counselorsin Zimbabwe and ACA. Ibelieve counseling can only ben-efit through learning theachievements and challengesfaced in other parts of the world.There are cultural and multicul-tural similarities and differencesthat need to be understood fromvarious perspectives. But thecounseling skills needed are thesame \u2014 empathy, genuineness,authenticity, being ethical inpractice. The theoretical frame-works we teach may be Ameri-can-Euro-centric, although thevariables that influence its prac-tice depend on the client andcounselor characteristics, cultur-al context and situation, as wellas the presenting problem. Inthat sense counseling in Zim-babwe is no different from coun-seling elsewhere. Carl Rogers isas much a counseling icon hereas elsewhere. We only need tonurture our own if the counsel-ing profession is to grow. Rachna Buxani, counseling coordinator,United Arab Emirates As a resident of the U.A.E., I found that there were not manyschools providing school coun-seling services, thus (they were)not able to cater to the personal,social and emotional growth ofstudents. Thus, I decided to takeone step toward that direction. There is definitely a stigma attached to seeking help from acounselor. This society believesin dealing with family issues inthe family itself and not sharingconcerns with others, whichmight harm the integrity of thefamily. Thus, people shy awayfrom contacting counselors forhelp. However, I have seen thischanging over time. Things aremuch better now than they werea few years back. Due to theawareness that professionals inthe field are trying to build,more people are becoming opento seeking help. I do think, how-ever, we have a long way to go. There are a lot of family and personal issues that the popula-tion has to deal with. The coun-try's economic development,the shift in family structure fromjoint families to nuclear familiesand larger numbers of women going out and earning a livingare a few of the reasons that(cause) stress. Thus, the role of acounselor is vital in helpingpeople cope with these changeseffectively. The counseling profession in this country is very raw. One ofthe main weaknesses of the pro-fession in this part of the worldis the total absence of any legis-lation that governs the ethicaldelivery of counseling servicesand professionals who enter thefield. Also, the lack of profes-sional development leaves verylittle scope for improvement inthe services being provided.There are no educational cours-es available for professionalswanting to enter the field ofmental health counseling,which restricts persons fromacquiring a formal education inthe country. The only way to geta degree in counseling is byleaving the country, which isnot always feasible or accept-able to all families. As a counselor working in school systems, I find it verystressful to work in an environ-ment that has no specific childprotection laws to deal withissues of physical and sexualabuse. The lack of awareness ofissues like learning disabilities,behavior problems, etc., makesit very tough to develop con-crete programs to help students.The concept of counseling isvery raw and, thus, we haveschools with one counselor to3,000 students, making it almostimpossible to cater to the needsof all the students who requireintervention. Also, the lack ofprofessional development andopportunities of interacting withother professionals leave youfeeling stagnated. I think it is essential for coun- selors to know how counselingis practiced elsewhere. Howev-er, it might lead to frustrationsbecause the structure to providethese services is absent. But Ithink we must learn and try toincorporate whatever we caninto our specific culture. It is also very important to note that counseling in theU.A.E. and among most Asiancommunities is looked upon assolution-focused. I come from abackground of training in theRogerian principles of counsel-ing, which I have found to workless here. In this part of theworld a counselor is lookedupon as a doctor who, by theend of the session, will havesome concrete ways for you tocope with the presenting situa-tion. That is very different from the Western principle of the pro-fession. The concept of long-term therapies is not accepted.People want brief, solution-focused intervention the majori-ty of times. Nuket Atalay, president, Foundation for theAdvancement of Counseling in Education(YORET Foundation), Istanbul, Turkey I am the president of the Foundation for the Advance-ment of Counseling in Educa-tion. This is my 17th year as afull-time volunteer. We pro-mote the counseling professionin Turkey and give trainingprograms when we can affordto do so. Turkey has a young popula- tion. Most of our counselorswork with children and youthservices. There are 19 universi-ties that give undergraduatecounselor training. Our coun-selors have no difficulty in find-ing jobs in public and privateschools, and sometimes in otherinstitutions. The pay is low, butit is so for most helping profes-sionals. Recently some coun-selors are going into privatepractice. They make moremoney, but there is no mecha-nism for licensing or monitoringof the quality of their work, norany attempt to encourage themto take supervision. This can bean ethical issue we are not ableto tackle yet. The number of counselors and psychologists is increasing, andthe demand is also growing. Theeducation system has acceptedus, and I believe counselorshave made some positiveimpact on reducing school vio-lence, helping families under-stand adolescent development,helping improve communica-tion, etc. Yet the shortcoming ison social workers. We have onlytwo universities that give socialwork degrees, and since thereare no social workers in theschool system, counselors takethe role of the social worker. Wehave many counselors who arewilling to work with childrenand families who have prob-lems. I believe that we needpeople with more specific skillson crisis management, on lead-Global perspective Continued from page 1 ership skills and on advocacy work. I belong to an international organization called CIF Interna-tional. We help exchange profes-sionals for short periods of time.Turkey is a national branch ofthe international organization.The cultural, social and profes-sional aspects of the exchangeprogram are valuable, and I wishcounselors could also have asimilar chance to visit eachother's countries, stay with hostfamilies, observe the servicesand learn from one another. Nadine Pelling, senior lecturer in counselling andpsychology, University ofSouth Australia, Adelaide How is counselling viewed in Australia? Viewed by possibleclients and consumers well \u2014 asaccessible and, I think, worth-while. Viewed with suspicion bypsychology/psychiatry \u2014another competing helping pro-fession added to the mix. Notseen as having much of aresearch base at present, but afew of us conducting research incounselling are trying to adjustthis. Also, a new internationalbut Australian-based journal,Counselling, Psychotherapy andHealth , is devoted to related research. Strengths include a young and energetic counselling base, ascounselling is a new and emerg-ing profession here. Strengthsalso include a focus on clientwork and applied aspects of theprofession. Weaknesses includea lack of a research basis and thefact that many in counsellingleadership positions are notactually counsellors but psy-chologists. Anyone can at thepresent can call themselves acounsellor in Australia, but thisis not true of psychology. Coun-selling is not regulated, but psy-chology is regulated. Challenges: Second-class citi- zenship often in psy-chology. decisionsversus the counsellors them-selves. Competition and politicsbetween/among the variouscounselling groups in Australia,mainly the Australian Coun-selling Association and the Psy-chotherapy and CounsellingFederation of Australia, whichrepresent equal numbers of Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 35 counsellors in the country but take somewhat different stancesregarding the regulation ofcounselling. Counselling isbeing forced to take on an Aus-tralian psychology flavour or anAmerican counselling flavourfor the sake of regulation versusdeveloping as a unique Aus-tralian profession which isgrowing and changing to suitunique Australian needs andwants \u2014 defined by counsellors(not psychologists) andclients/public. I have been trained in both the USA and Canada and think thatknowledge of other professionaldevelopments can help us devel-op to suit our own needs whilelearning from other's journeys. Iam a member of counselling andpsychology groups in NorthAmerica, the U.K. and Australiafor this very reason. I am also amember of the InternationalAssociation for Counselling andread its journal for this reason.The more knowledge the better!For more information on coun-selling in Australia, check outthe upcoming special issue ofthe International Journal of Psychology .Agostinho pro-president, (ISMAI) and counselor/psychotherapist in privatepractice at MEDICALIS,Porto, Portugal Back in my college training years, the 1960s, in Portugal,under (Antonio de Oliveira)Salazar's rightist authoritarianregime, we were not allowed tostudy social or behavioral sci-ences such as psychology, soci-ology or political science at thecollege level. This was eventu-ally one of the reasons why Iended up moving to the U.S. tostudy sociology, psychology,psychoanalysis, anthropologyand political science. Counseling per se does not exist in Portugal. To my knowl-edge, the only training programin existence in Portugal, both atthe undergraduate and postgrad-uate level, is at ISMAI, myhome institution. Both programs were established or revampedwith the help of several schol-ars, of which it is fair to mentionthe names of Dr. Richard Page(U.S.A.) and Dr. Peter Hawkins(U.K.). Unfortunately, somemembers of the psychologystaff did not welcome our move.It is too soon to know whetherour idea is going to make it ornot. My hunch is that since thecounseling and psychotherapy\"paradigm\" is spreading all overthe world, chances are it willmake it in Portugal as well,eventually. We have a very peculiar situa- tion in Portugal in that there areabout 15,000 psychology gradu-ates jobless (since the mid tolate eighties, when the first psy-chology graduates came into thejob market, psychology becamevery trendy). As a result of that,our graduates in (psychosocial)counseling are experiencing ahard time finding a job not onlybecause there are so many psy-chology graduates out of a jobbut also because they will getfierce opposition on the part ofthe psychology establishment. I have no doubt in my mindthat if the counseling graduates have a fair share of the job mar-ket, they will prove themselvesto be as competent as anybodyelse in the field of human/personal/professional develop-ment and mental health. Theproblem is how to get there ifone is not given a chance. Onething the counseling graduatesare doing is getting organized interms of a professional associa-tion that would enable them tobe known and defend them-selves from prejudices and un-fair treatment on the part ofsome ill-informed people andinstitutions. Since (counseling is) so new to the country, what we need todo is to offer proper training tothose who want such trainingand promote counseling, mak-ing it more visible through, forinstance, well-organized andwell-promoted internationalcongresses and workshops. Challenges: The Portuguese word for counselor ( conselheiro ) has a special connotation (spiri-tual or moral counselor), whichthese (secular) days is not tooattractive, I am afraid. Being that Portugal is a Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 36peripheral power, we tend to be influenced by the bigger powerssuch as the U.S.A. or the U.K.,to name but two. As far as Iknow counseling is well-estab-lished (and growing) in suchcountries. Therefore, if weproved to the Portuguese societyat large and the Portuguese col-lege establishment that that's thecase, I suspect we would have achance to turn things around. Jane Chiu, counselor, Taiwan I was inspired by my mentor in graduate school. He set anexample and let me witnesswhat a counselor was like, andI realized that I might learn tobe like him and contribute tosociety. We had counselor licensure passed in 2002. The professionis developing. However, itneeds a lot of improvement.Many differences among thisprofession, as well as from otherhelping fields, need to be clari-fied and respected. The generalpopulation cannot accept theidea of seeking help from anoutsider and keeps problems ordisturbances inside the familyunit. The counselor professionals are striving to popularize theprofession and are putting a lotof effort into training programsin academic (arenas) as well asin the communities. Thestrengths are advocating forminorities for better welfareand treatment, urging the gov-ernment to legalize related lawsand emphasize the importanceof mental health, attractingmore health professionals toget involved in a more unitedeffort, promoting the profes-sion's public image and recruit-ing more potential professionalhelpers to join us. A lot of workis needed for further improve-ment, such as continued educa-tion for professionals andtrainees, the splitting and dif-ferences among the relatedfields and professions, enhanc-ing academic and professionalstandards, encouraging clinicsand academies to engage inresearch and practice, etc. The general population is still hesitating to seek professionalhelp due to Chinese tradition onfamily issues and individual pri-vacy (or liability). We need toknow the global trend in this profession and how other col-leagues deal with differentissues so we can support and learnfromeachother. Maraj Ahmed, Internation- al Students Advisory Ser-vices, Karachi, Pakistan I was working as a profes- sional trainer in a large com-mercial bank in Pakistan andused to train newly inductedgraduates. I enjoyed discussingwith them their career objec-tives and guiding them. I real-ized that there is a great needfor career counseling servicesin Pakistan. This led me toentering into this profession. Ileft the bank in 2003 and startedcareer counseling services inthe name of International Stu-dents Advisory Services. I can particularly talk about educational and career counsel-ing in Pakistan. Yes, there is astigma attached with it. Somefake educational counselorshave defamed this field to someextent, but still there is a lot todo for genuine counselors in thisparticular area. People are nowrealizing the importance ofcareer counseling as the jobmarket is getting more competi-tive in Pakistan, and I can saywith great surety that in the nearfuture there would be a greatdemand of professional coun-seling services. Following are the three unusual situations we are fac-ing: IRestructuring of the com- mercial organizations ISaturation in the traditional job market, and some new typesof jobs are emerging IDifficulties in deciding edu- cational path With the existence of these problems, professional counsel-ing seems inevitable for the fol-lowing areas: educational/careercounseling, counseling for pro-fessionals and organizationalcounseling. Challenges: The profession is not popular among the peoplebecause of (a lack) of set rulesor any registering body for prac-ticing counselors. There is also alack of availability of counsel-ing courses or professionaltraining programs for skillsdevelopment. In some areas it is needed to know the practice being carriedon elsewhere in the world (e.g.,educational, career, organiza- tional counseling, etc.). But forthe areas like family or marriagecounseling, we need to useskills or techniques compatiblewith the traditions of the fami-lies and their religion. Eva Faillace, counselor and college adviser, Marymount School, Barranquilla, Colombia After teaching high school students for over 20 years andhaving obtained a M.Ed. degreein guidance and counseling, Ifound there was a great need fora local (as opposed to an import-ed) counselor in the schoolwhere I had been teaching, so Iwas given the position and havebeen now a counselor for 25years. Counseling as seen in the United States does not exist inColombia. Schools have psy-chologists on their staff. Nostigma is attached to counselingsince the profession as suchdoes not exist. Counselors can definitely make a difference since a schoolcounselor focuses more onadvising and orientation. InColombia, only schools that fol-low the American (besides thelocal) system of education havecounselors on their staff. TheColombian schools will havepsychologists. Trying to haveparents and teachers understandthe role of a counselor on theschool staff is probably the onlyreal challenge. Anne Kelliher, private practitioner and director of services, Kerry Counselling Centre, Tralee,County Kerry, Ireland In general, (counselling in Ireland) is now seen as anotherform of support. There is, ofcourse, resistance to it in somecircles, both professional andotherwise. (Counsellors canimpact lives in Ireland) by sup-porting clients to grow inawareness and break patternsthat are unhealthy, addictive, abusive, etc. (Also) by havingcounsellors who are sociallyaware and so include a widercontext in their counsellingspace, and by having counsel-lors who are trained to be awareof the spiritual core of theirclients and so support clientswho may wish to look at issuesin a deeper manner. (We have) excellent general theoretical and skills compo-nents to most accredited cours-es. There is room for researchimprovement. Only one generalcourse that has been accreditedhas a spiritual component to itscontent. This takes place atKerry Counselling Centre. Challenges: The rapid social and economic changes in thecountry and the ensuing chal-lenges. The Church scandals,mainly in the area of abuse, andmainly in the Catholic Church,and how this is affecting a popu-lation that was heavily church-going. The multicultural chal-lenges that are facing our profes-sion due to peoples from manyraces and cultures entering thecountry in huge numbers. I believe it is important for counsellors to know how peoplepractise elsewhere and to learnfrom that, especially where wecan learn about minority group-ings, culturally, sexually, reli-giously and what has beenshown to be best practice. Per-haps counselling is still differentin (Ireland) in that it is dominat-ed by a white, middle-classgrouping, mainly women, andmainly Catholic in name if notin practice. Gatis Lidums, private practitioner in Riga, Latvia,and part-time lecturer atthe University of Latvia(pastoral counseling andpsychology of religion) Currently in Latvia, there is some stigma attached to howcounseling is viewed. In myview it has to do with two mainreasons: IThere really is no adequate term in Latvian for counseling.A couple of terms are used(especially in the context of thecurrent Christian discourse), yetthose terms are not really widelyaccepted. All counseling in-evitably falls under the broadcategory of psychotherapy. IIn the Soviet era, if one went to therapy, it was most likelybecause the person was diag-nosed as mentally ill (the onlyexceptions to this rule werealcoholics and people with sexu-al dysfunction). Therapy underthe Soviet regime was only prac-ticed by a handful of psychia-trists and was considered a partof the larger psychiatric treat-ment plan. Once mentally ill, theindividual was almost withoutexception labeled \"crazy.\"Hence, the stigma. It has changed drastically over the last five to six years.Therapy has become increas-ingly popular, especially amongyoung professionals, familieswith \"problem children\" andpersons who have sufferedsome form of abuse. Counselors can have an impact in Latvia in severalways. The one that stands out inmy view is helping people tomore or less successfully copewith the fast pace of life and todeal with the effects of the\"shock therapy\" invoked by theforceful change from a socialistto a market economy. It alsohelps people to learn new/dif-ferent adaptive ways of relatingto other people in the fast-changing world. Most counselors I know are very well versed in different\"schools\" of psychotherapy andable to use a wide spectrum ofinterventions. Improvement isneeded in the area of nationallegislation that regulates the sta-tus of the counseling profession. The challenge that I myself feel from time to time is theuncertainty of my professionalfuture because of the absence ofregulatory instruments in theLatvian legislation. The Law ofPsychotherapy is currentlybeing debated for the third orfourth consecutive year. Thedebate is long and hard becausetwo different groups are lobby-ing two different approaches tothe particular law. One groupembraces the view that onlymedical doctors with specializedtraining are allowed to practicepsychotherapy. The other groupadvances the view that psy-chotherapy (counseling) is a freeprofession and can be practicedby any person with adequatetraining, regardless of theirbackground. At this point it isstill hard to tell which side willwin the debate. It is absolutely important, and even essential, for counselors toknow how counseling is prac-ticed elsewhere in the world. Global perspective Continued from page 35Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 37The world is growing smaller virtually every minute, and inthe global world of the 21st cen-tury, an effective counselor canno longer afford to be monolin-gual, monocultural, mono-theo-ry-based. Counseling is both anart and a science. As for the artpart of it, by being exposed tovarious ways of doing counsel-ing elsewhere, one's own \"art\"can only become richer andmore powerful. Most Latviancounselors/therapists I know areeither bicultural or even tricul-tural. I myself counsel people inthree languages, and I feelequally at home with all threelanguage groups' cultures. Andreea Szilagyi, associate professor atPolitehnica University of Bucharest, Romaniaand director, NBCC-Romania/NBCC-Europe In 1995, in the last semester of my university program (Facultyof Sociology, Psychology andSciences of Education), a pro-fessor created for the first timein Romania a class called\"School Counseling.\" I had thefeeling that counseling wouldbe something that I would reallylike to practice. I tried to find away to study the disciplinemore, but in Romania therewere no master's or doctoralprograms or even counseling lit-erature at that time. Fortunately,I found a professor who agreedto be my chair for an indepen-dent study and creative combi-nation of official course offer-ings for a Ph.D. program. As aresult, I was the first counselingdoctoral student and graduate inRomania in 1996. Counseling is not a recog- nized profession per se inRomania, although we have along tradition of vocational andeducational guidance. Counsel-ing is still an occupation or avocation, open mainly to psy-chologists, sociologists, socialworkers and education special-ists (for school counseling).However, there is an EducationLaw (1995) that recognizesschool counselors, and we havea Ministry of Labor network ofcareer offices within the labormarket. Because counseling is not a government or society recog-nized profession yet, it does nothave the power to promote itself. Therefore, we experiencerole confusion in relationshipwith some other helping profes-sions (psychology, social work)and also in relationship with ourclients (in schools: teachers andparents; within the labor mar-ket: unemployed, employers,companies, etc). As the popula-tion gains more independentthinking, counseling will bemore of an accepted process inour society. Just as counselingwas viewed with skepticism inthe U.S. a few decades ago, weknow that we will have thosesame hurdles to pass over. It is difficult to describe how counselors impact lives in Ro-mania, in that our practice is notwell-established. However, Ibelieve that school counseling isthe missing link between theschools/universities and thecommunities in Romania. I alsothink both school counselors andcareer counselors could offer adifferent perspective on the edu-cational and economic difficul-ties we face in a society markedby the transition from the com-munist regime to democracy.Poverty, unemployment, socialintegration and strong educa-tional programs are, in my opin-ion, just a few of the problemscounselors could solve. Strengths: IWe have (begun) improving counselors' attitudes own professionalization ISome very good education- al programs (master's level) IA Code of Ethics and Qual- ity Standards in Career Coun-seling (published by the Insti-tute of Educational Sciences) Needs improvement: IA better organizational structure. There is no estab-lished national association forcounselors (however, I am seek-ing to begin one) IA Code of Ethics good for all practicing counselors ISupervision and supervision of supervision ICounseling publications IMore research on counsel- ing in Romania Sometimes the academic com- munity and some other col-leagues (education specialists,psychologists) do not accept meas being a counselor or a coun-selor educator (as I identifymyself). I think that this reactionis quite normal due to the facts Ipresented above and because weare an emerging profession. I believe that especially in Romania, where counseling isstruggling to be a profession, itis crucial that our specialists areopen and interested in how counseling is viewed and prac-ticed around the world. Why?Because I think that our societyneeds this type of service andthere is no time to reinvent thewheel. I do not say that \"im-porting\" ready-made foreigncounseling models is the solu-tion, but adapting them to thecountry-specific needs and,later on, creating a pure Ro-manian counseling system if itis possible and necessary. I think there are also basic professional issues that can beaddressed by what we plan to dohere in Romania. That is to cre-ate standards of practice andtraining that allow us to usemodels like NBCC andCACREP to create our ownmodels for our own profession-alization. I have been fortunateto be able to learn much fromthe NBCC and CACREP boardsand staff that I can use here. Iam also grateful for the usefulinvolvement from NBCC-Inter-national in assisting us to createour own credentialing structure. Dan Guilfoyle, private practitioner, Sydney, Australia In recent years counselling has become more broadlyknown in Australian society be-cause of its prominence in anynews of natural disaster, wheretrauma counselling gets a men-tion in the news bulletins. Priorto, say, the last decade, psychia-try and psychology were indis-tinguishable to the vast majori-ty; the disrespectful term\"shrink\" was applied to both.Thanks to the emergence ofcounselling, all of these disci-plines have become more wide-ly perceived as less clinical andmore \"hands-on\" in the com-munity. As a consequence, thereis broad acceptance and dimin-ishing stigma. I have observed amajor shift over time as promi-nent celebrities get media expo-sure for \"coming out\" withdepression and the growth inawareness that the \"stigma\" ofmental disorder is exposed as adisorder in its own right. Counsellors can make a differ- ence to the lives of Australians ifthey demonstrate professional-ism and do not lose the momen-tum of the growing awareness.Tactics such as encouraging suf- to needs via talk-back recruiting prominent suffer-ers to the cause of raising publicawareness of the disturbinglylow government investment inmental health in this country areurgently needed. In most of the English-speak- ing world, the past two decadeshave seen falling investment inmental health as the budgetshave been eaten up by high-techdiagnostic equipment, etc., andmanpower has been slashed as afirst priority. This balance has tobe redressed, and counsellors arethe best witnesses to the eco-nomic cost of reactive ratherthan preventive orientation. Australia has gone from the shortest working week in theOECD to the longest workingweek, with the bulk of thechange occurring in the pastdecade, in the hands of a moreconservative government. Interms of social consequences,this has led to greater stresses onparents and less caring time forchildren, with disturbing escala-tion in divorce rates and youthsuicide. In the last month, statis-tics have revealed that the great-est cause of death in the maleyouth group (ages 10-15) is sui-cide. Such changes for theworse prompt the conclusionthat activism by counsellors as agroup and their professionalorganisations would benefit theAustralian society greatly. One of the reasons I joined ACA was that the organisationof our peak bodies vis-\u00e0-vis thespecial field affiliations of coun-sellors by preferred therapy ispoor. For example, there are twopeak bodies, one for careercounselling and the other for allthe rest. Counsellor education isvia the accredited preferred ther-apy groups, who have their ownidiosyncratic curricula withmuch useless and irrelevanttraining provided as core seg-ments, but mandated essentialfor successful accreditation. Theaccreditation bodies are oftenNGOs who employ counsellorsfrom their government fundingand appear to educate in theirown therapeutic preference anduse the accreditation schools asde facto recruiting pools. Hence,instead of a foundation general-ist first year, specialism exists atthe base and there is no indepen-dent external examination. It is hardly arguable that major gains are made by ourlooking outside of Australia fordifferent templates, consideringour own is so rubbery. Kay A. Crookendale, counselor, Barbados Though there is still some stig- ma, there is a growing accep-tance of counseling in Barbados,especially among younger peo-ple, who benefited from interac-tion with guidance counselors insecondary schools. TV programslike Dr. Phil seem to be con- tributing to greater awarenessand acceptability of the idea ofcounseling. Barbadians experience the same pressures of modern life asothers \u2014 family and relation-ship breakdown, job and finan-cial stress in the global environ-ment, etc. Problems are alsobecoming much more complexbecause of social change in thesociety. Systems of supportthrough extended family or reli-gion are less available, and pro-fessional counselors have be-come more and more necessaryand are more often sought out tohelp people negotiate throughcrises and transitions. There are more people enter- ing the field and seeking profes-sional training, as opposed tofunctioning as informal helpers.However, the biggest need is forproper regulation of the profes-sion (and) the establishment ofprofessional associations withthe power to enforce agreed eth-ical standards. Counselors alsoneed to undertake culture-spe-cific research and work toincrease public education aboutthe counseling process. The counseling process is still largely misunderstood in Barba-dos. People tend to look foradvice, a quick fix. It is oftendifficult to encourage clients tostick with the process untilchange is established. \"Payingto talk\" is sometimes not seen asvalue for money. No part of the world exists in isolation, and trends affectingone culture sooner or laterimpact on the rest of the globalvillage. This is especially true ofsmall island states like Barba-dos, which are heavily depen-dent on tourism. Counselingtheories, etc., must be adaptedto be relevant and effective inour reality. Caribbean culture isto some extent a hybrid betweenindividualism and collectivism.Our unique social and economichistory and small geographic Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 38size have produced a people who are intensely private.Establishing a counselor-clientrelationship of openness andhonesty, which will allow shar-ing at the deep emotional level,is therefore more difficult andmore time-consuming. Capt. Awang Rusli Bujang, head of Research and Training Branch,RBAF (Armed Forces)Counseling Center, Brunei Darussalam Generally, counseling is so- cially well-accepted and recog-nized at the national level. It isbecoming more and more pop-ular among our youngsters.They are willing to talk over aradio talk show on counselingmatters. A senior governmentofficer from time to time willmake remarks on the impor-tance of counseling for theschools, societies and govern-ment departments. The potential stigma would be that counseling is meant forpeople with problems whocan't manage their life proper-ly. At the end of the day, thereare people who restrain them-selves from seeing a counselorto avoid being labeled as\"problem people.\" I believethis is due to misunderstanding,or perhaps the counseling prac-titioners themselves don't real-ly do enough to make the gen-eral public understand better. Being willing to help is one thing, but doing it right is atotally different thing. Thesocieties here are rather conser-vative in their belief, and reli-gion has taught them well onconcepts of how to handle con-flicts, hardship and everydayissues, but it was mostly con- ceptual . Our approaches, which are proven practical, objective,effective and systematic, areappealing to them. There is a general belief that counseling really can helptoday's illness, and the policy-makers seem favorable to thisidea. It can be seen with theestablishment of counselingcenters within government de-partments, as well as formationof nonprofit organizations deal-ing with social issues who areoffering counseling services. But we really need to workhard on promoting the truepractice of counseling. To my knowledge, there are still very few military organiza-tions that let their own service-men (army, navy, etc.) handlecounseling professionally.Even in the U.S., counseling isdone by civilians (qualifiedcounselors) who are not mili-tary personnel. Being an armyofficer myself, we better under-stand the problems faced byour men. On the other hand, theestablishment of counselingwithin the military setting isalso a positive step toward inte-grating the human approachinto the regimental or militaryapproach. As a relatively new profes- sion here, the challenge wouldbe to make people understandwhat counseling is really aboutand to meet their expectation ofso-called successful help given.Being a small country and asmall population but with bigresponsibility (too often hold-ing one job with multipleroles), every counselor has tobe good at juggling betweentheir primary job, secondaryjob and lots of other responsi-bility. Certainly it's important to understand how counseling ispracticed in other parts of theworld. It helps us to under-stand, learn and appreciateeach other. How can we help tomake a difference when wedon't know the difference?Bruneians, as new practition-ers, can learn from Americanswho are far ahead of us. But there are some aspects which are \"too American\" tous, which are not really applic-able here. Most us here seegood social relationships, be itwithin the family or society atlarge, as fundamental. In otherwords, there's no way wewould jeopardize the relation-ship for individual sake, forexample. With those values,person-centered theories orthose emphasizing reflectiveapproach too often don't reallywork here. Apart from that, cul-ture and religion play an impor-tant role in our life. So we can'tafford to only be knowledge-able in counseling, but to knowand understand both culture(including the value system)and religion. Audrey M. Pottinger, lecturer and consultantclinical psychologist,Department of ChildHealth, University of theWest Indies, Mona,Kingston, Jamaica Whilst counselling as provid- ed by elders and spiritual advis-ers has always been an integralpart of traditional Jamaica, thisservice has become increasinglymore professionalized over thepast decade. This has been espe-cially attributed to the advent ofan undergraduate degree pro-gramme in psychology in theearly nineties at one of the mainuniversities in Jamaica. Not-withstanding, there is still a stig-ma attached to mental healthcounselling in Jamaica and theCaribbean. In my experience,however, a gradual acceptanceof counselling is being seenamong professionals and themore educated from within themiddle income and above cate-gory. There is still a genderdivide among this group, withwomen being more willing toseek out counselling. Griefcounselling relevant to traumat-ic loss is being increasinglyrequested by a wide cross sec-tion of the Jamaican populationregardless of socioeconomicstatus or education. One of the ways counsellors can make a difference inJamaica is by striving to main-stream their services. They canwork with the school systems toimplement programmes that canbe executed by teachers andschool counsellors (and) work inthe health care systems, includ-ing primary care facilities andhealth centres, with the aim ofintegrating mental health ser-vices in the existing services.This should result in reducingresistance to treatment as well aseducating practitioners fromother disciplines about mentalhealth care. They can also usethe media to educate the publicabout professional services andstandards as well as self-carefrom a mental health perspec-tive. This could also involveinforming media practitionershow to be more sensitive in con-ducting interviews with victimsof violent crimes. The small number of profes- sional counsellors (in Jamaica)allows for those in the profes- sion to know each other. Thisfacilitates an effective referralsystem among the professionals.It also allows us to better supporteach other. Whilst the smallnumbers provide an advantage,the lack of a larger pool of qual-ified persons can result in anincreased demand on the coun-selors themselves and their ser-vice. There is also a need forlicensing and accreditation toregulate the quality of servicesoffered to the public. Also, ascounselling is not covered byinsurance, this service can bequite expensive for clients. It is important for counsellors to not only liaise with their localpeers but also work collabora-tively at the international level.This provides an excellent op-portunity for exchange of ideas,beliefs and best practices in thepluralistic world we now existin. Multiculturalism exists inmost societies, and Jamaicansare known to be nomadic. Manyreside and/or acquire their ter-tiary education outside of Ja-maica, and knowledge of theircultural practices would there-fore facilitate effective and ap-propriate counselling responses. Amos A. Alao, director, Careers and CounselingServices, University ofBotswana, Gaborone Professional counseling (which some would refer to asthe Western approach to psy-chological counseling) is new inBotswana. However, I muststate that many Africans believein traditional counseling andstill patronize traditional heal-ers/counselors who are calledby various names in differentAfrican countries. In Botswana,they are called \" Sangoma \" or \"Dingaka Tsa Setso .\" While some feel comfortable with traditional counseling, pro-fessional counseling is viewedwith some suspicion, evenamong people with formal edu-cation. For example, in a recentstudy conducted by the Univer-sity of Botswana Careers andCounseling Center on theappraisal of its services to uni-versity students in 2005, the stu-dents gave a number of reasonswhy they have not utilizedcounseling services in the uni-versity. Out of 841 subjects classified as nonusers of ser-vices, 34.7 percent felt theycould handle their own prob-lems; 24.1 percent indicated thatthey seek spiritual interventionto their problems; 30 percentexpressed fear of confidentialityof issues discussed. Some sub-jects indicated that counseling isfor people with problems ofself-esteem. A high percentage(83.6 percent) of the nonusersindicated that not wanting oth-ers to see them coming for helphas prevented them from seek-ing help. The cultural belief thatone does not talk about his orher problems with strangers wasa concern for only 18.8 percentof the nonusers. Still, the need for counseling has been recognized in Bot-swana. This has resulted in theavailability of counseling pro-grams in various tertiary institu-tions in the country. Counselorshave a significant role to play onthe issues of HIV/AIDS in termsof pre- and post-HIV test coun-seling and eventual supportivecounseling for people who areHIV positive or living withAIDS and the affected. Coun-selors can play a significant rolein another concern in the country\u2014 relationship problems, whichsometimes result in the death ofone of the partners. The Botswana government has a laudable policy and pro-gram for the youth in the coun-try. The policy addresses majorconcerns such as unemploy-ment, alcohol and drug abuse,teenage pregnancy and (drop-ping out of) school. Counselorshave a significant role on issuesof youth to enable them to con-tribute economically and lead aproductive life, while limitingtheir involvement in crime andother negative and anti-socialbehavior. There is visible support for the training of counselors inBotswana. There are also shortcourses in counseling withfinancial support in terms ofattendance from the govern-ment. There is a need tostrengthen counseling as a pro-fessional association wheremembers could meet at regularintervals to foster their profes-sional development. Challenges include making clients see that counseling is agood option of receiving helpand correcting misconceptionsabout counseling that is West-ern-oriented and not suitable forAfrican clients. Global Perspective Continued from page 37Huda Husseini Bibi, associate professor ofeducation, Dar Al HekmaCollege (I am Lebanesebut working in Jeddah,Saudi Arabia) Counseling is viewed here the same as when it first startedin the U.S.A. 50 years ago.(That) is changing but veryslowly. Still many believe thatit is a luxury rather than anecessity. Counselors can have an impact by believing in theirmission as agents of change.Work hard and never give up.In addition, talk about it andpersuade as many as possible tobelieve in what they are doing.There is a lot of misconceptionabout this issue. Weaknesses are more than strengths at this time and place.However, it sometime takestwo or three to make a differ-ence. For example, as an asso-ciate professor in education atDar Al Hekma College, if thedean and the director believe inchange, together we can makea difference. We are thinking ofopening a graduate degree pro-gram of study next year, whichcould be the first of its kind inthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Challenges are many. As I mentioned, the idea of counsel-ing is new. We need awarenesscampaigns. We lack informa-tion concerning who is an ACAmember in our area. We needsupport from ACA profession-als to allow us to spread theseservices in our area well and inno time. Here we have thephysical facilities but notenough qualified human re-sources. The more we share counsel- ing practices the better wouldbe our services. Counseling inEurope is so different fromcounseling in China and that inMorocco and so on. In the Mid-dle East, as in other places inthe world, counseling practicesvalue the religious and ethnicpractices of Islam. We are in the process of pub- lishing a book of referenceabout counseling as viewed bythe Qura'n and Sunna. Thisbook will be translated intoEnglish as soon as it is finished.Giovanna Gianesini, marriage and family counselor, Ethica Counseling Center, Schio (Vicenza), Italy Initially trained as a clinical psychologist, I perceived coun-seling to be more effective andeasier to benefit from for themajority of distressed individu-als and couples experiencingrelationship difficulties or deal-ing with traumas and losses. The attitude toward counsel- ing and its potential effective-ness in Italy is negative. It isoften viewed as a behavioralmodification technique with nogrounded theoretical back-ground and short-term, ineffec-tive outcomes. The stigma isthat psychological problems anddifficulties can only be dealtwith one way \u2014 through long-term psychoanalysis. We needto develop better nonpatholo-gizing models of psychologicalinterventions that take intoaccount the nature, factors andeffects of psychological prob-lems. Today in Italy, counselingis a new profession, quiteunknown to the general public,and not yet legally certified.Universities are now offeringcourses and training in counsel-ing, but not yet a formal, distinctdegree. The situation will dra-matically improve when thecounseling gains legal recogni-tion as a distinct psychologicalintervention. The majority of individuals who may benefit from counsel-ing, especially couples andfamilies dealing with separationor divorce issues, are notreached and too often are leftalone or rely on unqualifiedsupport and help from otherprofessionals such as lawyers.Counseling can resolve rela-tionship conflicts and angerissues with former partners,improve communication andcreate healthy relationshipswith (parents) and children. Counseling has great potential in Italy, as the country is facingmajor changes in family struc-ture (reconstructed familieswith stepparents and stepchil-dren) and multicultural issues(interracial marriages). Theneed for psychological interven-tions that are solution-oriented,affordable and brief is reallyhigh. However, we need toimprove the quality of our train- ing as counselors and develop astandard for certification. Clients are increasingly multi- problem families, characterizedby concrete needs, emotionalproblems and multiracial/multi-cultural issues. They are seekingcounseling for assistance onbalancing cultural differencesand solving conflict after sepa-ration or divorce for child cus-tody and visitation rights. Thereis still a greater attention to indi-vidual pathology than on rela-tionship difficulties and, in cou-ple's therapy, to each partner'sstory rather than on the dynam-ic of their interaction. Whatneeds to be understood is that asmost relationship problems areperpetual problems to deal with,they don't get solved but getcoped with, and the more effec-tive and affordable treatment issolution-focused counseling ra-ther than psychoanalysis. Different cultures communi- cate in different ways. Mar-riages and families \u2014 all kindsof committed or everyday rela-tionships \u2014 are specific to eachculture. Counselors need tohave access to the repertoire ofemotional engagements andconnections in different coun-tries as they have a big implica-tion on key moments of intima-cy building, conflict resolution,coping mechanisms, ethicalstandards and psychologicaltreatments. My formal trainingand experience in the U.S. andmy bilingualism are fundamen-tal to my clinical practice inItaly today. Mari Sayama, therapist, Nishi-Ochiai Clinic, Tokyo, Japan The medical, educational and legal societies in Japan acceptand need counselors who workas specialists. On the otherhand, there are still a lot ofobstacles in establishing thesocial position of counselingdue to stigmas and misunder-standings. During the lastdecade, the educational pro-grams on counseling have grad-ually matured and improved inJapan. Before having such pro-grams, however, we hadresearch-oriented psychologyprograms only. The graduates ofthose programs worked as \"psy-chologists\" in some medicalfields. Other specialists (med- ical doctors, social workers,etc.) considered them as a\"tester\" at that time, and thismisunderstanding still remainsin the current social position ofcounselors. Since the psychology commu- nity in Japan has received a lotof influences from PsychoDynamics theory, people gener-ally believe that counselingalways involves \"sand box\" or\"analysis.\" Some people evenmistakenly believe that if theytake some personality exam oranalyze their past experiencesand know who they are, thentheir problems will be goneinstantly. Counselors in Japan can help clients who feel hopeless in theinconsistency between the con-servative views rooted in ourtraditional culture and the newviews based on individualismrecently imported to this coun-try. Moderation, cooperative-ness and obedience have beenregarded as virtues in Japanesecultural traditions. Today,many young people are suffer-ing from a dilemma betweentraditional duties to meet fami-ly expectations and the wishesto design their own lives them-selves. Through counseling, wecan make a difference in theirlives. We can help them to finda clue to start a new, active,constructive life without caus-ing unnecessary conflicts withothers having traditional viewsthat are still prevalent in thiscountry. Although Japanese tradition- ally don't want to reveal theirpersonal concerns to others, thenumber of clients who visitcounselors and talk about theirpersonal stories has been in-creasing. This shows how peo-ple need counseling even withinsuch a conservative culture. The current counseling edu- cation and licensure systems inJapan aren't enough to satisfythe needs. Immediateimprovements are necessary.We have a lot of universitiesproviding programs of counsel-ing education, but the quality ofeducational curricula is insuffi-cient. Counseling teachers insome universities don't havesufficient or appropriate clinicalexperiences, and some didn'teven study counseling in anyacademic institutions. More-over, every facility/university isbiased toward a particular fac-tion. It significantly limits stu-dents' skills and knowledge,and this is why Japanese coun-selors generally use techniquesin one discipline only. Each school or faction doesn't havemuch interaction with others, sothe counselors tend to workwithin their own very closedsociety. This problem makes itquite difficult to arrange appro-priate referrals and make appro-priate counseling plans fordiverse clients. One more problem: The tech- terms Japanese counselorsuse are usually jargons ratherthan professional words used inDSM or ICD. Therefore, other professionals such as psychia-trists, nurses and social workersdon't understand what the coun-selors are saying, which makesit difficult for counselors toshare information and worktogether with them. There are neither official licenses nor a compulsory boardof counseling in Japan, whichmeans Japanese \"counselors\"need not hold graduate-leveldegrees or clinical experiences.They only have unauthorizedcertificates issued by each fac-tion they belong to. Due to sucha messy situation, many clientswho want a qualified counselingservice, as well as students orprofessionals who seek an offi-cial license of counseling, oftenget confused and spend unnec-essary money and time. Work-ing in these conditions, I alwayspay extra attention to what othercounselors have (e.g., their edu-cational/clinical experiences,the ethical codes they hold, etc.)when I work with them. The employment status of counselors is not secure inJapan. Most Japanese coun-selors are hired as part-timeworkers whose income is gener-ally not sufficient to supporttheir family. And furthermore,we have no insurance for possi-ble risks in our professionalactivity. This may be one of thereasons why Japanese \"coun-selors\" have to do conservativecounseling only. There are almost no counsel- ing specialists in Japan. Wehave virtually no mental health,addiction or rehabilitation-spe-cialized counselors, and veryfew facilities have educationprograms on these specialcounseling needs. Therefore,the counselors are generallyreluctant to meet clients withserious problems such as drugabuse, suicidal risks and/ormental disorders. Historically in Japan, Bud- dhist priests played the role thata counselor plays in modernsociety. Even now, some people Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 39 Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 40choose going to a Buddhist tem- ple to talk with priests or to doZen meditation rather than ask-ing a counselor for help. Someof these clients tell us thatspending their time in the calm,silent environment of a templeis important for healing andencourages personal develop-ment. Japanese counselingincludes such self-reflection(called Naikan Therapy) inappropriate set-tings after eliminating reli-gious tastes. Rabbi Binyomin Adilman, lecturer and marriagecounselor, Jerusalem,Israel I was trained as an elemen- tary-level school teacher. Later Istudied for the Rabbinate, and Iam now a seminary-level lectur-er and educator. I found that Iwas called upon frequently as acounselor and thought I couldgive good advice. I was wrong,so I decided to learn counselingto be a more effective educator. Iwas trained as a marital and fam-ily therapist, and I love the work. I work with almost exclusive- ly strictly religious individuals.Counseling has been traditional-ly the province of rabbis. Coun-selors are now more accepted,especially when facing prob-lems that require more than thefine-tuning of communicationsand relationships. The academic world here in Israel is overwhelmingly psy-chodynamic. Nevertheless,practically speaking, Israel has agovernmental system which hasits roots in socialism, so socialworkers are the predominateand preferred mental health pro-fession. Counseling as we knowit has found its niche in the last20 years. I would venture to saythat the influx of Anglo-Jewishimmigrants has contributed tothe number of professionals andclients as well. Israel is still in many ways a country that embraces familyvalues. Much of modern cultureseems to diminish the impor-tance of these values. Coun-selors are able to help hold fam-ilies together and to help buildnew families. Additionally,counselors who have competen-cies in trauma work are greatlyneeded here.Israel has such an interesting blend of people who have comefrom all over the world to livehere and are thus different, yetintensely connected, since weare all Jewish. I believe thatbeing an effective counselor inIsrael surely requires multicul-tural competencies, regardlessof where or with whom onelives. Sailaja Menon, Dubai Community Health Centre(DCHC), United Arab Emirates A counselor or a psychologist is not the first referral sourcethat the community here turnsto. This is mainly due to theinbuilt, broad-based culturalnorm that when there is a prob-lem you turn to your family. Ican say this with some degree ofauthority, having lived nearly 20years in the Asia Pacific region,about 17 years in the UnitedStates and about a year in theGulf region. Also, there were noformal degrees or fields of studyin this specialized field inschools and universities in theGulf. However, the whole con-cept of counseling has madegreat strides in gaining recogni-tion in this country over the pastfive to six years. This can beattributed to increasing aware-ness and a growing multicultur-al community. Dubai in particu-lar in the U.A.E. is a very cos-mopolitan, multicultural citythat has a population in excessof a million and of which 80percent are expatriates. Thediversity has definitely con-tributed to better awareness ofthe benefits of counseling. Counselors have been able to impact lives in different ways inDubai \u2014 through media, arti-cles in local magazines andnewspapers, workshops andpresentations, and by develop-ing and implementing programsin the community. For instance,the Dubai Community HealthCentre, in partnership with poli-cymakers, schools, internationalorganizations and other educa-tion-related centres, launchedABLE, an organization to edu-cate and provide services onspecial needs for children. The strength of the counseling profession in this region, espe-cially at the centre where Iwork, is adopting a servicemodel of \"multidisciplinaryapproach in a nonclinical ambi- ence.\" This model gives a greatsense of comfort and creates anonthreatening, nonintimidatingenvironment for ourclients/community. They arestarting to comprehend whatcounseling and mental healthservices are and reap the bene-fits of this process. DCHC, a licensed clinical center by the Ministry of Healthand the Ministry of Education,functions out of a beautiful villathat has been remodeled andtransformed into a professionalclinical centre. When you walkonto the premises you will seefamilies lounging, congenialsupport staff attending to theneeds of waiting families, andchildren watching TV and play-ing with toys and activityblocks. This centre specializesin counseling, psychology, psy-chiatry, homeopathy, yoga,Reiki, special needs, schoolcounseling to name a select few.This homey, nonclinical ambi-ence with a holistic approach tomental health, special needs andalternative therapy has been akey factor in clients returning tothe centre for a committed treat-ment program. The centre's suc-cess has led to a growingdemand from clients to openbranches in Bahrain, Oman andAbu Dhabi. Counseling/psychological services are still a new andemerging field in this area. Uni-versities in the region do notoffer degrees in this specificfield, which has led to a short-age of qualified professionals,especially Arab females. Al-though we have an Emirate Psy-chological Association as a reg-ulating body in this field, thereis definitely a critical need forcontinuing education, betterawareness and marketing of thecounseling program, developingliterature and resource materi-als, well-equipped libraries, uni-versity degree programs, con-ferences and workshops. I think it is extremely impor- tant to know the different mod-els of services provided world-wide. The world is increasinglybecoming a global village withpeople from different cultures/ethnic backgrounds constantlymigrating out of their homecountry to other parts of theworld. Getting to know differentmodels of clinical services andtherapeutic approaches thatwork in different parts of theworld can be beneficial and canhelp in incorporating some ofthe best practices into yourmodel. As the world is moving toward a multicultural environ-ment, it is important that themodels of services also haveelements that are cross-culturalin nature. This will also create asense of comfort in clients. Cathy Morey, crisis intervention specialistwith Mission to the World,living in Honduras Actually, they don't know what a \"mental health coun-selor\" is here. Anyone who doesany counseling is referred to asa psychologist and mostly isused by children. It is rare thatan adult will seek help. With theinflux of foreigners, that viewappears to be changing. There are many \"street chil- dren\" here and much need forchild and teen counseling cen-ters to address drugs, sexual andphysical abuse, suicides, etc. Iam one of very few who willwork with children and teens inparticular. Areas that need improve- ment? Cross-cultural issues canalways be improved (includingbody language, tone of voice,male-female relationships, etc.).Religion also plays a big part intheir worldview here, so it toomust be incorporated into multi-cultural training. I grew up in Latin America (although I am an American)and so am familiar with what itis like being a minority. We havea host of different cultures in theU.S. Cultural sensitivity plays abig part in counseling tech-niques. We all have our ownstyle of counseling. However,we must always take into con-sideration the client's customsand cultural beliefs so as not toinsult them. What is \"correct\" inour culture is not always \"cor-rect\" in another! For example, itis accepted in this culture thatmen have several girlfriends inaddition to their wives. Often awoman might come to counsel-ing for depression. Our first \"redflag\" might be that her husbandhas a girlfriend, but that's notnecessarily an issue for the wife!We need to be sensitive to whatthe client thinks might con-tribute to the problem as well asunderlying/unspoken issues. Also, I think it would be won- derful to allow interns to dosome of their hours overseas. As of this minute, they cannot getcredit for this even if they areworking under a U.S.-licensedmental health professional. Iwould love to start a multicul-tural counseling training centerhere. Ngozi Osarenren, associate professor ofcounseling, University of Lagos, Nigeria Counseling in Nigeria is viewed as seeking advice from a\"stranger.\" The extended familysystem, the community leaders,religious leaders, etc., are con-sidered the right avenues fordiscussing whatever problemsany individual may be experi-encing. It is believed there is noproblem anyone will be goingthrough which the elders havenot handled previously; there-fore, people should take theirproblems to them and they willget a ready answer. When any-body goes to a counselor, itimplies that the person has norespect for family values. Counseling in Nigeria is seen as being synonymous with ad-vising students on career choice,subject selection and a school-specific programme. The Niger-ian National Policy on Educa-tion (1998) document recog-nized counseling thus: \"In viewof the apparent ignorance ofmany young about and in view of per-sonality amongschoolchildren, career officersand counselors will be appointedin post-primary institutions.\" However, this is changing because many people seem toappreciate the work of and theneed for professional coun-selors. The counselor, thoughstill viewed as a \"stranger,\" isnow a friendly, trusted and reli-able stranger. Many people goto the counselor whenever theyhave a need/problem and theyare attended to, but (this is done)as a social service rendered bythe counselor necessarily \u2014 notfee paying. The majority of theclients who patronize coun-selors do so willingly. Counselors can impact lives in Nigeria through the provisionof rehabilitative counseling ser-vices to displaced persons fromthe different ethnic and religiousconflicts in the country. Second-ly, involvement in handling Global perspective Continued from page 39Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 41issues/activities which members of their communities considerimportant \u2014 e.g., the street chil-dren, out-of-school youth, thedrop in school attendance of thegirl child in the northern partand boy child in the eastern partof the country, etc. Thirdly, pro-viding accurate information onthe causes of HIV/AIDS anddiscouraging the current attribu-tion to spiritual and evil attacks. There is increased awareness of the work of counselorsthrough the activities of theCounseling Association ofNigeria (CASSON), both at thenational level and the differentstate chapters. More people areinterested in studying counsel-ing both at the undergraduateand postgraduate levels (coun-seling is offered as a degreeprogramme in about 25 of the37 state and federal universi-ties, with over 10,000 registeredstudents in these institutions).In fact, the national president ofCASSON or a representative isincluded as a member of certaincommittees on educational andallied matters. The governmentendeavours to employ coun-selors in some key offices andorganizations (the NationalDrug Law EnforcementAgency, etc.). However, there is need for improvement in certain areas interms of the practice of counsel-ing in Nigeria. There is a needto improve the perception of thecounselor by the general public(so they will) realize that thecounselor is not just someonewho is expected to work in theschool system alone and give\"advice\" to students concerningcareers and maladjustmentproblems. In about 30 of the 36 states in the country, counselors stillhave full teaching loads in addi-tion to performing their func-tions as counselors. This partic-ular issue has been a very vex-ing one, creating a series of con-flicts between counselors andtheir school heads, with themajority of the counselors fac-ing constant threats of dis-missal. This situation has leftmany counselors confused andcompromised in the face of theincreasing rates of inflation andunemployment in the country.Oftentimes, students have diffi-culties going to discuss theirproblems with the counselor,who also doubles as a teacherand the disciplinarian. There isalso interference from schoolheads who insist on being fur-nished with the details of anycounseling interactions betweenthe counselor and the students. As a counselor educator, it is difficult to teach many studentswith very limited or near nonex-istent resources. I'm regularlyconfronted by former studentswho are not able to establish arelationship or congruence be-tween what they were taughtand the realities in the field. Another challenge is the issue of payment of fees for counsel-ing services. At the end of thesession, clients feel that \"thankyou\" and prayers are sufficientcompensation for the services ofthe counselor. Clients generallyconsider it unacceptable to payfees, and they grumble whenyou insist on payment. When theissue of fees is raised before thebeginning of the session, manyof them politely opt out, whileothers will leave promising tocome back, which never hap-pens. It is pertinent to mentionthat despite all the shortcomings,there are still many individualswho willingly come for counsel-ing and are also ready to pay forthe services. Maria Peristiani, Intercollege CounselingCentre, Nicosia, Cyprus In the past there was much more intense stigma surround-ing counseling in Cyprus, prob-ably linked to a number of rea-sons, including: IA clash between the role of a psychologist with the role ofconfessor (the latter was the jobof priests). IConfusion amongst people about a psychologist's role (asopposed to) that of a psychia-trist; believing that there was aproblem of mental illness ifyou visited one of the two. Itseems that people, mostlywomen, started visiting psychi-atrists with the transition fromtraditional society to a modernsociety. Intense social changeand urbanization beginning inthe 1960s (and especially afterthe 1974 war) and the accom-panying strains pushed clientsto psychiatrists initially andsubsequently to counselors. ITraditionally people would not \"expose\" their \"secrets\" out-side their families. Cyprus is a small society, and people even today want to retaintheir \"good name\" and image.So counselors need to be awareand sensitive to clients' fears ofexposure and to (their wish to) maintain confidentiality. Today the ignorance and prej- udice has declined through thehuge expansion of the mediaand the enhanced information tothe public about psychologicalissues and the role of the coun-selor. The stigma is also lesspronounced, and more peoplecome for therapy for a greatervariety of problems, includingmarital problems, extramaritalaffairs, learning difficulties, sex-ual problems, etc. The counselors in Cyprus can have an impact in empoweringwomen to lead a normal life. Itis mostly women who visitcounselors or psychiatrists, ob-viously as a consequence oftheir inferior status in societyand their many tensions. Forexample, they now have to sup-port children and family, begood housewives but also workand possibly become successfulin their career. Although womenhave undertaken more rolestoday, the truth is that attitudesand beliefs and values change ina much slower fashion. The counselors can also help men liberate themselves inaccepting their weaknesses andlimitations along with theirstrengths, and also in expressingtheir emotions. Men are themore privileged sex in Cyprus,but their problem is that they donot learn to express themselvesand their feelings, putting up amask of strength. Counselors are helping shift the focus from mental illness topersonal and interpersonal diffi-culties and thus minimizing thestigma. As many more coun-selors are now practicing inCyprus, they are offering to thecommunity the choice of psy-chotherapy in addition to phar-macotherapy. Through empow-erment, self-awareness and thesearch for solutions to theirproblems, people are mobilizingtheir inner resources and build-ing trust in themselves. The total lack of regulation of the counseling profession so farhas allowed large numbers ofgraduates in related areas toenter the profession. Despite theadverse conditions, there arecounselors who offer qualitywork and attend conferencesabroad and whatever is offeredon the island. The recent joiningof Cyprus to the EuropeanUnion will help raise the stan-dards and create professionalassociations at a faster pace. The total lack of regulation means that the profession wasswarmed by both good and badcounselors. The challenge is how to make the proper distinc-tions and establish the properstandards so as to safeguard thecredibility of the profession inthe long run. Another problemwe face is that there are very fewtrained supervisors, so the coun-selors feel isolated and degradedand lonely in their work. At thesame time, this situation leavesspace for malpractice. General-ly, there is lack of academic andprofessional stimuli in the coun-try. Very few conferences, train-ing programs or workshops takeplace. Regulation and the formation of an associationwould empower and unite coun-selors and offer them opportuni-ties for further professionaldevelopment. One way I believe counseling is different in Cyprus than insome other countries is that it isa very small island wherealmost everybody knows every-body else. So counselors herestruggle much harder to keep upwith the ethical guidelines of theprofession. Personal and profes-sional roles are sometimes unin-tentionally blurred; i.e., it is notuncommon for counselors tomeet clients in restaurants ormovies, or to be working withmore than one family memberor a client's friends. Edoardo Giusti, training counselor and psychother-apist, Rome, Italy Counseling in Italy is growing slowly. As a matter of fact, justrecently, different schools havestarted specific counseling com-munity empowerment trainingcourses over the territory. Coun-seling in Italy will become moreuseful with multicultural usersand when a higher collaborationwith medical staff and psychol-ogists starts developing. Youmust remember that it is only 15years that psychologists havebeen professionally licensed. Counseling is extremely use- ful in health promotion, psy-chopathology prevention andharm reduction. It needs to bedeveloped mostly in schools byappropriately trained teachers incounseling skills and supervi-sion. The next challenge to facewill be the creation of trainingprograms certified by publicinstitutions as well as privateprofessional associations. In Italy, we base our practiceon the European Association for Counselling- and British Asso-ciation for Counselling-recom-mended standards and ethicalcode. Counseling is in generalmore focused on practical expe-riential training and less on the-oretic factual knowledge. Kelly Metcalf, school counselor, Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands Saipan is technically a U.S. commonwealth, but it's veryseparated from the \"Americanculture.\" With the strong influ-ence of the local culture and thehigh Asian tourist population,plus many other cultures thatare here, it's really its owncountry. As far as how counsel-ing is viewed, to those whohave been educated in theSates, it is much more accepted.To those who have not beeneducated in the States, their cul-tural influence makes a big dif-ference on how they view coun-seling. Even if you're in theStates, I think the understand-ing of what general counselingis and how it can help is differ-ent from school counseling. Ithink there's still a lot of confu-sion in many schools as to whata counselor can do and how thatperson fits into the educationalsetting. Every school in theStates seems to have its owndefinition of school counseling,and that is the same for outhere. Bottom line, counseling isaccepted, but I would say mostpeople really don't know whatit is. My goal here was to set up a functioning ComprehensiveGuidance Program. I realizedthough that the things I neededto do that weren't always inplace: a functioning communi-cation system, rules, basic ideasof professionalism, etc. I had tostep back and say, \"This is whatI have to work with. How can Ihelp my kids with what I canand cannot change?\" Coun-selors give hope. I see myself asa safe haven for students, teach-ers and parents. A place whereyou won't be judged, disci-plined or laughed at (but in-stead) empowered and relieved.I see myself as a mediumbetween people or as a resourcefor more information. Coun- Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 42selors can make a huge differ- ence no matter where they are.It's all about redefining yourgoals once you see what you'reworking with and what the stu-dents need. Counselors can givehope to those who can't see lifegetting better. The main areas that I am con- stantly fighting for are ethicsand professionalism. Coun-selors are only successful whenthey maintain a certain level ofethical responsibility: confi-dentiality, accountability, etc.Everyone knows everyone onthis island, and it's very diffi-cult sometimes to work withparents or other agencies wherethey know who I am or theyknow who I'm talking about. Ihave a hard time working withsome people who don't under-stand why I can't tell themeverything about a student. I think it's important for counselors to understand howcounseling is practiced else-where. That's exactly why I'mover here and why I'm planningon going to another country. Iwant to see how other schoolsare run, how counselors are per-ceived around the world, howlaws are written for counselors.I want to see what works andwhat doesn't. I think it's vitalfor everyone to see how othercountries live and work, not justin counseling. You cannot fullyunderstand how you fit into theworld without going to othercountries. You must leave yourcomfort zone. Counseling is very influ- enced by one's culture, andevery counselor must under-stand her own culture beforecounseling those of other cul-tures. You want to make darnsure that you're always remem-bering that it's about what theclient thinks and wants, notwhat you want. Counseling is very different here in Saipan than in otherplaces because it is greatlyinfluenced by the culture. Ican't change the culture, and inorder for me to make any kindof impact, I had to accept that.What is important to me, theculture I grew up in, is notalways the same as the cultureof the student who walksthrough my door, and I have tohonor that.Anne Hyde, master's level counseling student atSeton Hall University(online program), Kenya Counseling is a relatively new profession in my country. Be-cause Kenya is a collective soci-ety, traditionally, problems havebeen solved at the family andcommunity level. There is still alot of stigma attached to seeinga counselor. Counseling is asso-ciated with AIDS, serious men-tal problems or substance abuseproblems. There are very fewpeople who will admit to seeinga counselor or even think aboutseeing one for the sort of prob-lems that people see counselorsfor in the U.S. However, the stigmatization associated with seeing a coun-selor is gradually eroding. It isironic in a sense that the onething that is doing a lot to publi-cize counseling is AIDS. Thereis a lot stigma attached to AIDS,which prevents a lot of peoplefrom disclosing their HIV-positive status for fear of socialrejection. Due to the heavy tollof the AIDS pandemic on thepopulation, people are encour-aged to take HIV tests as a wayto better manage their lives ifthey are infected and to takeprecaution if they are virus-free. Counseling is offered in cen- ters established around thecountry known as V oluntaryCounseling Testing Centers.These centers have by nongovernmentalorganizations through and T.V . advertisements.The need created by the AIDSpandemic has led to a mush-rooming of counseling schools.Local universities have alsorecently started offering degreesin school counseling. Because counseling is a rela- tively new profession in Kenya,there are so many areas in whichcounselors can make a differ-ence in people's lives. Kenyafaces a lot of problems arisingfrom poverty, disease, substanceabuse and gender violence,among many others. Currentlythere are no professional schoolcounselors. This role has tradi-tionally been served by teach-ers. School counselors can beespecially helpful to students,especially with their career deci-sions. The way the school sys-tem is set up, students choosethe universities they would like to attend and their careersbefore taking the final nationalexamination, whose resultsdetermine whether students willbe accepted in a particular pro-gram or not. The result is thatsome students tend to play itsafe, and some wind up choos-ing careers/programs for whichthey are overqualified. In addi-tion to this are the usual adoles-cent concerns such as peer pres-sure, teen pregnancy, substanceabuse, family problems, etc. Where people may not be able to afford individual counseling,group therapy \u2014 such as meet-ing people in church \u2014 is beingused, albeit very minimally, toaddress problems that affectpeople in general. There are many issues facing women and the girl-child inKenya. Such issues includeearly childhood forced mar-riages in some communities,high school dropout rates, fe-male genital mutilation, domes-tic violence, rape, depression,etc. Nairobi Women's Hospitalwas established a few years agoto cater to gender violence suchas rape and domestic violence.(This hospital also caters to menwho have faced sexual vio-lence.) In addition to treatment,these individuals are offeredcounseling. Alcoholism is also increasing- ly becoming a concern inKenya. Yet, there are very fewsupport groups in operation inthe country. In other words,there are so many areas in whichcounselors could impact peo-ple's lives. Thom Pannebakker, private practitioner, Maasbracht, Netherlands Being a professional counsel- lor in the Netherlands is stillbeing in the vanguard. The firstpioneer who introduced coun-selling as a therapy in theNetherlands was Wiebe Mons-ma. He started a private practiceand was the founder of the SCNInstitute. But nowadays coun-selling (the client-centeredapproach) is becoming moreand more widely known. Espe-cially in enterprises and schools,the counselling practice isincreasing. Also, health insur-ance companies do authorizecounselling in several cases andclients are getting (partial) com-pensation. I can say that coun- selling, because of the numberof students, is increasing as aprofessional therapy. In the Netherlands, coun- selling is being practiced in pri-vate practices. On the otherhand, integration in other pro-fessions is also taking place, liketeachers in schools who are get-ting extra time to practice coun-selling. Also in enterprises,especially in the personneldepartment, employees are get-ting the opportunity to studycounselling. Also, a lot of stu-dents are coming from out of themedical, penitentiary and pas-toral circuits. In the Netherlands, there is a lot of pressure on psychiatry andpsychotherapy. The number ofpatients is increasing, and so arethe waiting lists. Waiting forthree to six months for intake ora first session is common here.So counselling can have a veryimportant function in this situa-tion because there are a lot ofwaiting patients who can betreated by counselling therapy.As a matter of fact, a lot of thosepatients who have a pathologi-cal disorder and need treatmentand therapy by a psychiatrist ora clinical psychologist areblocked (by other waitingpatients). So counselling is ableto help shorten the waiting listsand to give adequate therapy tothose who need a short time intherapy and don't suffer from apathological disorder. In the Netherlands we have our counselling association, DeAlgemene Beroepsverenigingvoor Counselling (AbvC), ofwhich AbvC has about 450members and is still growingevery year. Of course we can'tcompare with ACA, but youmust have had a small start aswell. At AbvC, the priority is tosafeguard the quality of thecounselling in the Netherlands.Therefore, schooling and super-vision by the members havebeen required to get the yearlycredits for the license. In my opinion, it is really important for counsellors tounderstand how counselling ispracticed elsewhere in theworld. I have a lot of experiencein England. I run a postgraduatesupervision course at LeicesterUniversity and have met a lot ofprofessional counsellors overthere. I have seen that coun-selling as a common therapy iswidely known in England. Thatis the big difference betweenEngland, the U.S. and theNetherlands. Mostly we have toexplain the word \"counselling\" first and, after that, the impact(therapy/philosophy). For thecounsellors in the Netherlands,getting to know more about col-leagues and counselling abroadand (having) an exchange ofknowledge and informationseem Sapna Paliwal, psychotherapist and counselor, J.N. MedicalCollege, Aligarh, India I decided to enter the counsel- ing profession because it is afast-growing profession and hasa worldwide scope. Only in thisprofession do we jointly work tohelp each other beyond the lim-its of religion, colour, culture,country, etc. We are alwaysready to share our knowledgeand experience to benefit theother. With this profession wecome close to each other. Beinga counselor will help us and ourfamilies to live healthy lives. In general, a lukewarm atti- tude toward counseling stillexists in our country and may beattributed to the fact that it is aforeign concept. In addition,there is a significant amount ofconceptual confusion regardingthe term \"counseling\" and \"clin-ical psychology.\" The mostimportant reason for the not veryimpressive status of counselingin India is a lack of facilities fortraining professional counselorsand also the \"social stigma\"attached to receiving counselinghelp from the professionals.However, the scene is fastchanging, with several universi-ties offering specialization incounseling. Basically, in ourcountry, the counseling processis largely accomplished by theexchange of verbal communica-tion. Hence, it is often referred toas \"talk therapy.\" Our more traditional view on counseling is the strength of ourcounseling profession. As weknow, Lord Krishna was the firstcounselor, and Bhagwada Gitaembodies the finest principles ofcounseling. I think it is important to understand how counseling ispracticed elsewhere in theworld because we can learnhow (to better help our clients),what is new in counseling andwhat is more practical to be Global perspective Continued from page 41Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 43practiced. With sharing our knowledge and our viewsworldwide, we come to touchcountless experiences of thecounselor, from which we selectwhat looks most applicable. Marie-Dominique Le Bouteiller, counselor and psychotherapist practicing in Divonne-les-Bains (near Geneva,Switzerland) and living in Bourgogne, France There is no equivalent to a counselor in France. No univer-sities offer the kind of trainingoffered in the U.S. The closestequivalent to a counselor is apsychotherapist. Nonetheless,you should know that in Francethe profession of psychothera-pist is not yet regulated. There has been a developing interest in counseling/psycho-therapy in the past few years,although one still has to consid-er three very different attitudesin regard to therapy: ITherapy is part of the course for educated people when theyfeel it is needed and for peoplewell-established economically.Here one can almost say that inlarge cities, having a therapist isfashionable. It sounds a bit likea Woody Allen movie, but it is areality we have to take intoaccount! IFor lightly educated people (high school degree or nodegree at all except for specificmanual training), psychothera-py is still viewed as reserved forthe mentally disturbed. There isdefinitely a stigma attached tothe field of psychology, whichis quite often confused with thatof psychiatry. Nonetheless, oncein a while, we do get clientsbelonging to this category. Mostof the time they are referred bya trusted M.D. Still, they go (togreat lengths) so no one knowsabout their visit to the therapist.Such clients are nonethelessextremely keen at working hardon their therapy and are mostoften absolutely wonderful andoften terribly wounded peoplewho (come) to us after havingtried every other possibleavenue. ILast but not least, our strongest opponents and criticsare psychiatrists. They alsoreceive strong backup from the very members of the govern- ment working on defining thefield of psychotherapy today.As a whole, they place coun-selors at the level of cartoman- ciennes , or people reading cards. They have no trust andobviously no regard for ourtraining and capacities. Not sur-prisingly, in France 95 percent(if not more) of psychiatristsare exclusively Freudians. Thefew who are interested in otherforms of mental health care(CBT, Jungian, etc.) haveunfortunately kept the verysame attitude against coun-selors. This being said, psychothera- py is more and more acceptedby the general public, and it ishoped that one day it will cometo be considered in the sameway as it is in countries likeSwitzerland or the U.S.A. Counselors can make a differ- ence in France by beingexceedingly professional andserious. The need for peoplelike us exists. We need tobecome more visible, talk moreabout our profession and showthe general public what kind ofwork we do. In other words, weneed to demystify the profes-sion. We also need to organizemore at the local level. Onlythen will we be able to have asignificant impact on the men-tal health landscape. The humanity we bring to the field of mental health is proba-bly our biggest asset. To this Iwould add the space we giveour clients (something psychia-trists here have a hard time offering). Life today is oftenharsh, even if we do not live indeveloping countries: Competi-tion, job insecurity, relationalproblems, the world politicaland economic isola-tion, etc., all contribute to (thefragility of) individuals. Whatmost need today is a safe placeto unload, be listened to andhelped by well-trained profes-sionals who are not \"frighten-ing\" but warm and compassion-ate. It is essential for counselors to understand how counselingis practiced elsewhere. First,because as world citizens wehave to accept that multicultur-alism is more and more a fact inan ever greater number of coun-tries, and we all have to devel-op a feeling and understandingfor this unique condition. Andthe best way to understand is tolisten to the people who areoffering information. Books aregood, but nothing is better thanfirsthand accounts and sharingof experience. Second, I believe that as counselors we can (contribute)to world peace: When ourclients experience feeling betterbecause of the help we haveprovided, they leave havinglearned that 1) reaching out isworth it and 2) it is OK to askfor help and it is OK to receiveit. When through our servicesour clients define differentlytheir place within themselves,their family or their community,they also define themselves in alarger context where tolerance and understanding of differ-ences are a plus and not athreat. The best way to achievepoints 1 and 2 is to be able toshare and understand what ishappening elsewhere in thefield of mental health practice. Peter Bean, former lecturer in counselling,now in private practice inAdelaide, South Australia Counselling is becoming more accepted in Australia.There is an explosion of peopletraining to be counsellors butnot the same explosion of peo-ple requesting counsellors.However, it is more common(compared with 5-7 years ago)for people to seek counselingand not consider a stigmaattached to it, while society hasnot completely embraced it yet. As society continues to em- phasize the individual andrights of the individual, moreand more people are lookingfor connection, which unfortu-nately they no longer find soeasily in family, neighbour-hood, church or local commu-nity groups. So some are will-ing to pay for connection, or atleast someone who can helpthem move along the path ofconnecting with others. Coun- sellors can also help people tomove beyond the medicalmodel, where experts have theanswers or where a magic pillwill wash away all troubles. Strengths include increasing standards of training and thegrowth of umbrella organiza-tions to represent counselors.An area that needs improve-ment would be less politicalfighting between these umbrel-la organizations. Governmentrecognition of trained counsel-lors (apart from psychologists)would also be good. Challenges include making a living, a willingness of peopleto pay for services (trainingand experience). It constantlystaggers me that people willpay $200 to service their carregularly but expect help forrelational and emotional issuesto be cheap, cheap, cheap. We can all learn from each other, but there are major cul-tural differences between coun-tries which are often ignored(even between the U.S.A. and Australia). This often detractsfrom what could be valuablelearning experiences. One ofthe differences in Australia isthat brief therapy is brief (oneor two sessions); long-termtherapy is slightly longer (twoor three sessions).

Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 44Embracing the deep structure of multicultural counseling The multicultural counseling move- ment has taken center stage in the coun-seling profession. In doing so, it is trans-forming the way many persons thinkabout their roles as professional helpersand the types of competencies they needto acquire to foster the healthy develop-ment of larger numbers of people fromdiverse groups and backgrounds. While the movement continues to rev- olutionize the mental health professionsin general and the counseling professionin particular, it is disconcerting to notehow many people who view themselvesas multicultural advocates have lostsight of or perhaps never really under-stood the deep structure of the multicul-tural counseling movement. In thismonth's column, we discuss that deepstructure and include a description ofboth the goals and purposes of many ofthe pioneers of the multicultural coun-seling movement. We proceed by examining how the trend toward human diversity, diversitycounseling and human relations traininghas led many counselors to a more com-fortable and superficial understanding ofthe deep structure of the multicultural counseling movement. Last, we outline specific recommenda- tions that will help counselors reconnectwith the spirit and principles underlyingthe deep structure of this revolutionarymovement. Building a more sane and just society The genesis of the multicultural coun- seling movement can be traced to the cul-tural revolution of the late 1960s andearly 1970s. This was a time of greatchange in the United States, as many tra-ditional social institutions, policies andpractices were challenged by people inoppressed groups, especially African-Americans, who took part in the civilrights movement, and feminists, whosupported the women's rights movement. It was during this time that Black coun- selors and psychologists, as well as fem-inist advocates and persons from otheroppressed groups, described the manyways in which gender, cultural and racialbiases were embedded in all the theoriesof human development, counseling and psychotherapy. The early multiculturaland feminist counseling pioneers provid-ed a strong and consistent voice thatprotested overuse of these theories byhelping professionals. These theorieswere noted to result in ineffective andeven harmful psychological outcomes inmany instances when utilized amongwomen and persons of color. The early multicultural-feminist coun- seling pioneers underscored two majorfactors to substantiate their arguments.First, many of these pioneers pointed outthat the cultural/racial/gender-biased the-ories were harmful to persons in op-pressed groups. The professional prac-tices reflected a set of values, biases,preferences and worldviews that were inconflict with those held by persons fromoppressed groups. Persons from op-pressed groups were already psychologi-cally vulnerable because of the stressesthey experienced in their everyday lives.By imposing their conflicting cultural/racial/gender biases, it was believed thatcounselors further undermined the indi-vidual and collective strengths thatwomen and culturally/racially differentpersons brought to the counseling set-ting. This observation led some of theearly multicultural counseling pioneersto refer to counselors who insisted onusing culturally and racially biased theo-ries in their professional practices as\"tools of oppression\" and \"handmaidensof the status quo.\" That action underscores a second important observation made by pioneersof the multicultural counseling move-ment. Many counselors, they noted,seemed most interested in helpingclients make personal changes thatwould enable them to more effectivelyadjust to the status quo. In so doing, itwas thought that individuals wouldexperience more satisfying and produc-tive lives within the context of the exist-ing social order. From a multicultural perspective, there is a problem with this biased approach tohelping. Namely, many aspects of the sta-tus quo are not just; these aspects contin-ue to perpetuate various forms of racism,sexism and cultural oppression that areantithetical to the mental health and psy-chological well-being of culturally andracially different persons. The consistentassertion that it is unethical to use cultur-ally and racially biased helping theoriesto assist people in adapting to a status quothat is fundamentally in opposition totheir well-being is a key element of themulticultural counseling movement'sdeep structure. Biases built into society The deep structure of the multicultural counseling movement is grounded in aclear understanding of the various waysin which racism, sexism and other formsof cultural oppression are built into all thesocial, educational, professional, eco- nomic, religious and political institutionsthat constitute our contemporary society.These forms of cultural oppression arereflected in: IIncreasing levels of racial segregation in housing and public education IDisproportionate annual incomes of persons from different racial/ethnicgroups IThe continued violence that is imposed on women IInaccurate and negative ethnic/racial images in the media IThe disproportionate number of per- sons of color in our nation's prison sys-tem and on death row ISignificant health disparities among persons in different racial groups This list contains only a few examples; there are many others. From the inception of the movement to the present time, some multiculturalcounseling advocates have understoodhow the previously mentioned issuesrepresent deep structural problems thatadversely affect the development of mil-lions of people in our society. These indi-viduals also recognize that an extensiveand coordinated effort by large numbersof persons in the counseling profession isrequired to effectively address thesecomplex problems. This understandinghas led some persons in the multiculturalcounseling movement to acknowledgethat these structural problems are main-tained by what noted Black psychologyscholar Asa Hilliard calls \"pillars ofdominance.\" Hilliard points out thatthese pillars of dominance continue tonegatively impact every institution in oursociety, including the fields of counsel-ing and psychology. Pillars of dominance Contrary to what many people would like to believe, the mental health profes-sions have not made the sort of substan-tial progress that early multiculturalcounseling pioneers had hoped wouldoccur during the past 35 years. There isno doubt that progress has been made,both in the mental health professions ingeneral and in the counseling professionin particular. This progress has left manycounselors pleased with the accomplish-ments of what is now commonly referredto as the \"diversity counseling move-ment\" (a term many counselors seemmore comfortable using than \"multicul-tural counseling movement\"). Much of the success of the diversity counseling movement is tied to anincreasing awareness of, sensitivity toand respect for human diversity. Thisincludes but is not limited to: IHelping people gain a better under- standing of why it is offensive to useculturally and racially offensive termsin public IPromoting a better understanding of the types of competencies that counselorsDignity, Development & Diversity - BY MICHAEL D'ANDREA AND JUDY DANIELS Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 45need to acquire to work more effectively with persons indiverse groups IEstablishing various activi- ties in schools and communi-ties that affirm the culturalintegrity of culturally differ-ent persons in our society.This is notably reflected inthe celebration of Black His-tory Month in our schoolsand an increasing number ofGay Pride parades in ourcommunities While these and other similar efforts are useful in promotinghuman dignity through diversi-ty, we agree with Hilliard'sassertion that such achieve-ments represent relatively su-perficial accomplishments thatfall far short of the deep struc-ture of the multicultural coun-seling movement. Specifically,such achievements fail to sub-stantially affect the pillars ofdominance that continue toencapsulate our nation in gen-eral and the counseling profes-sion in particular. If multicultural counseling advocates are to more substan-tially impact the mental healthand psychological well-being oflarger numbers of persons whocontinue to be adversely affect- ed by the pillars of dominance,they must acquire a clearerunderstanding of the movement.Gaining this understanding ofthe deep structure of the multi-cultural movement and the pil-lars of dominance necessitatesexpanding our vocabulary andconceptual understanding ofother related issues. To assistcounselors, we briefly discusstwo terms that are beginning togain greater attention amongsome multicultural and socialjustice counseling advocates. Exploring hegemony, hegemonic structures and multicultural counseling The term hegemony is de- fined as the \"dominant influ-ence of one state or group overall others.\" Cultural critics suchas bell hooks, Cornel West andNoam Chomsky have docu-mented the many ways middle Christian cultural/racial the hege-monic thinking that character-izes our contemporary society.This sort of thinking leads to the development and maintenanceof \"hegemonic structures.\" Hegemonic structures refer to how hegemonic thinking leadsto the creation and maintenanceof institutions that make up theinfrastructure of a given societyto maintain the pillars of domi-nance that are fueled by a par-ticular set of cultural values,biases, preferences and world-views. Although some progresshas been made in understandinghow the counseling professioncontinues to perpetuate hege-monic structures within ourprofessional ranks, this under-standing is limited to a relative-ly small number of persons whoare cognizant of the multicul-tural counseling movement'sdeep structure. A few of the many ways that hegemonic structures and think-ing still exist in our profession: IContinued use of culturally biased counseling interven-tions in clinical practice IOngoing publication of coun- seling textbooks that providea superficial analysis of thecultural implications of coun-seling and human develop-ment theoriesIProfessional training pro- grams that continue to useculturally biased entranceexaminations in their selec-tion processes IProfessional accreditation and licensing bodies that continueto direct insufficient attentionto cultural/racial issues IThe tendency of counseling professionals to overgeneral-ize research findings that arenot representative of personsfrom culturally and raciallydiverse groups Further embracing the deep structure of the multicultural movement Recently, the American Coun- seling Association has madesignificant progress in acknowl-edging the pillars of dominancethat adversely affect the mentalhealth of millions of culturallydifferent and oppressed personsin our nation. This progressinvolved the advocacy efforts ofleaders in Counselors for SocialJustice who successfully se-cured the formal endorsementof the ACA Governing Councilfor eight multicultural-socialjustice resolutions. These reso-lutions impact that ableism,ageism, racism, classism, sex-ism, heterosexism, religiousbigotry, and war and violencehave on healthy human devel-opment. The resolutions also state the important role counselors canplay in ameliorating these un-healthy pillars of domination.To accomplish this, counselorswill have to address the hege-monic structures that sustainthese pillars of dominance and,more fundamentally, the hege-monic thinking that underliesthe creation and maintenance ofthese structures. In doing so, counselors will more fully realize the deepstructure of the multiculturalcounseling movement and moreeffectively foster the dignity anddevelopment of larger numbersof persons from diverse groupsthan ever before. I Michael members in the Depart-ment the University of Hawaii.Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 46Securing supervision experience for licensure Q:I have an M.A. degree in community counseling andwould like to sit for licensure.However, I am having anextremely difficult time finding ajob that provides me the oppor-tunity to accumulate supervisedhours in this area. Most of thejobs out here require a license,which I do not have. I am veryanxious to begin working so thatI might be able to help the men-tal health community in which Ilive. I graduated with a 3.8 GP A.If you have any suggestions orknow anyone out there whomight be able to assist me,please let me know. A:Yours is not a unique situ- ation. I hear from many newgraduates of counseling pro-grams who are having troublesecuring appropriate supervi-sion experiences so they canmeet licensure requirements.My best advice is this: 1. Contact the program direc- tor and/or other faculty fromyour graduate program to seekassistance in identifying a super- vision experience. 2. Contact your state licensure authority. In many cases, it willhave a list of approved supervi-sors in the state that you cancontact. 3. If you develop a supervision experience on your own, it's agood idea to clear it with thestate licensure authority to makecertain it meets the standards/expectations for licensure. 4. Don't be surprised if you have to pay for supervision.(Your faculty should be able toclue you in on prevailing rates inyour area.) V olunteer work inexchange for supervision mayalso be an option. Q:I am currently a graduate counseling student. I would liketo start a job in the field before Ibegin a practicum. Do you haveany suggestions as to the bestplace to \"put my foot in thedoor\"? I currently work in theDepartment of Veterans Affairsbut am not sure I want to stay in the federal government. A:Personally, I think an administrative position in anagency is great experience. Asyou've noted, the \"foot in thedoor\" approach is pretty goodwhen it comes to gainingpracticum opportunities. Inaddition, the administrative sideis important for anyone who hasgoals of management or privatepractice in his or her future.With your government experi-ence, assuming you've learnedhow to navigate federal pro-grams, you would be an asset tomany organizations. Q:I was reading the Septem- ber issue of Counseling Today , and I noticed an interesting arti-cle under the Career Corner. Iam both a member of ACA and agraduate student in a counselingprogram, and I am interested insubscribing to COUNSGRAD.Would you provide me with someinformation?

ICounseling Career Corner - BY AMY REECE CONNELLY Amy Reece Connelly is ACA's manager of Career Services. Contact her at acacareers@counseling.org . Private Practice in Counseling - BY ROBERT J. WALSH AND NORMAN C. DASENBROOK Q:I have interviewed (for employment) with a medical clin-ic. They would like to hire me.However, the issue of LCPC(master' s degree licensed coun-selor) nonpayment for Medicareseems to be the roadblock. Theyseem to have a large percentageof Medicare clients, and theybelieve they would lose moneyhiring an LCPC. Help! This ismy last effort to seek employmentwith this medical group. Do youhave any ideas? A:Medicare rules allow pay- ment to LCPCs if they are em-ployed by a psychiatrist under the\"incident to\" provision. (The fol-lowing is taken directly from thepolicy of Medicare management,Wisconsin Physicians Service.) \"Incident to\" services are de- fined as \"services or supplies fur-nished as an integral althoughincidental part of the physician'spersonal professional services\"(MCM 2050.1). The \"incidentto\" also applies for servicesfurnished \"incident to\" the pro- fessional services of nonphysi-cian practitioners. For the complete explanation, go to www.imhca.org/incident. html. Also, we would advise checking the rules in your stateand then presenting this informa-tion to the employer as reason tohire you. Good luck. Q:I have had my own practice for the past five years. Recently acolleague received her MSW, andwe are interested in creating apartnership. We are unsure howto go about establishing a part-nership with my existing prac-tice. Any information or sugges-tions you could provide would behelpful . A:Without knowing how your solo practice is presently set up,we can't say for sure, but let'sassume you are a sole proprietor(not a subchapter S or PC). Thesimplest and least expensivemethod is to set up a \"joint ven-ture\" with your social workerpartner. I have been in private practice with a licensed clinicalsocial worker for 23 years andwe have a joint venture. As I understand it from my accountant, in this type of part-nership you and your partner poola set amount of money to pay forcommon/shared expenses. Fromthis pool of funds, which are split50/50, you pay items such as rent,phone, utilities, office help, etc.These expenses are reported oneach of your taxes on schedule C.No other income or revenuesgenerated by you or your newpartner are comingled, thus eachpartner's income is based on pro-duction (number of clients treatedand fees collected) and notdependent on the other partner.As always, please consult youraccountant. Good luck in yournew venture. Q:I am having a difficult time gaining access to managed carecompanies if a new client wishesto see me and I am not with themanaged care company that han- Medicare nonpayment and the 'incident to' provision for counselorsdles the client' s mental health coverage. A:We have developed the fol- lowing strategy (we call it the\"Three-Part Response\") to re-spond to denials by an insuranceclaim or refusal to allow a clini-cian to be a member of a man-aged care panel. For the mosteffective response, all lettersshould be sent. 1. A letter is sent from the client (after a release signed by theclient) to the managed care orinsurance company explainingwhy he or she wishes to see thisparticular licensed therapist. Acopy is sent to the client's benefitsmanager. 2. The clinician sends an appeal to both the client's employer ben- efits manager and the managedcare or insurance company out-lining the clinician's credentialsand the reason why the client wasreferred to the clinician. 3. The clinician asks his or her state organization to develop aresponse to denials. This letteroutlines the type of license, thetraining and the extent ofpracticum involved. This is sentto the client's employer with acopy to the insurance or managedcare company. We've found this to be an effec-tive way to respond to denials. The clinician is usually listed asan \"ad hoc\" provider with theassigned new provider number.Many times, the clinician isincluded in the managed carecompany's database as a regularprovider.

Nicole Coleman per-formed an archival study of1,461 client records at a largeuniversity counseling center toevaluate three potential charac-teristics of dropout for clients onwaiting lists: waits of less thanthree weeks for counseling ser-vices versus waits of more thanthree weeks, problem types (edu-cational/vocational versus emo-tional/social) and client race(African-American and Euro-pean-American, by self-report). Most clients (73 percent) did return for counseling after beingplaced on a waiting list. Clientswho waited more than three weeks dropped out more fre-quently than those who waitedless than three weeks for coun-seling services. African-Ameri-can clients who waited threeweeks or less were more likelythan their European-Americancounterparts to drop out. Prob-lem type was not a significantpredictor of attrition. The researchers speculate on several reasons for the racial dif-ference they found. They also list12 strategies that might help sus-tain clients' connection to thecounseling center during thewaiting period between intakeand first session. The study isreported in the Fall 2005 issue ofthe Journal of ing(pages 107-117). ICounseling T oday IJanuary 2006 48Innovations in Counseling - BY SUSAN X DAY Despite efforts to curtail heavy drinking on college cam-puses in the United States, thehigh levels of alcohol con-sumption by college studentsappear to remain steady. Bysome definitions, approximate-ly 60 percent of college stu-dents are heavy alcohol users.Interventions for this behaviorusually regulate the times andplaces for drinking, providepunishments for alcohol-relat-ed misbehavior and violations,and mandate psychoeducationfor offenders. However, a stu-dent's readiness to change israrely considered in these ef-forts, even though it is general-ly accepted that a client's atti-tude toward the problem influ-ences which interventions willbe most effective. In the October 2005 issue of theJournal of Addictions and Offender Counseling (pages 22- 37), Todd Lewis investigatesseveral motivations behind col- lege drinking, including percep-tions of social norms (whatfriends and typical studentsusually drink) and stages ofchange (current feelings andthoughts about one's owndrinking habits and the desir-ability of change). Research showed that more ambivalence about one's alco-hol use, combined with percep-tions that close friends drinkheavily and experience conse-quences, is associated with acollege student's intensity ofalcohol use and consequences.That is, if students witness theirfriends drinking heavily \u2014even with bad results \u2014 theyare also likely to be heavydrinkers. Lewis explains how these re- sults translate into counselinginterventions that target stu-dents' motivations more closelythan they currently do. Understanding perimenopause Women in the United States between the ages of 45 and 55experience hormonal changesfor up to 10 years beforemenopause in a separate periodof the life cycle called peri-menopause. Irritability, depres-sion and anxiety, as well as feel-ings of loss brought on by enter-ing the second half of life, oftenspur women in perimenopauseto seek help for the emotionalside of these changes. But manyof these women don't under-stand the physical side. Andrew Daire and Heidi Fairall summarize this occur-rence in \"Sexuality and Peri-menopause: What CounselorsNeed to Know\" in the Fall 2005issue of ADULTSP AN Journal (pages 105-115).

ACA Foundation Message - BY JANE GOODMAN First, let me thank the many members of the counselingcommunity for your generosity.Your contributions of both timeand money have been exem-plary. The American CounselingAssociation Foundation hasasked for donations and youhave responded as we continueto raise funds this year for theCounselors Care Fund and ourother projects, including theGrowing Happy and ConfidentKids program. You have been reading about the Counselors Care Fund in anumber of issues of Counseling Today in part because so many of us are deeply committed tohelping \"our own\" directly, aswell as helping our colleaguesprovide assistance to the manypeople suffering from the recenthurricane disasters. I am pleased to note that at its most recentboard meeting, the ACA Foun-dation trustees approved amotion that established theCounselors Care Fund as a per-manent part of our activities.While there will unfortunatelybe other disasters, the ACAFoundation wants to be in aposition to help. We are delighted to provide funds to the worthy activities Ihave described, as well as anumber of other endeavors thatbenefit many aspects of our pro-fession. But, of course, we needyour continued support to do so.I have been touched by the giftsI have had the privilege ofreceiving this year on behalf ofthe ACA Foundation. However,we need lots more.

She alsoserves as ACA treasurer and is a past president of theassociation.Counselor generosity touches lives Matching interventions to motivations of college drinkersCounseling T oday IJanuary 2006 49 Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 50BY SCOTT BARSTOW, CHRISTOPHER CAMPBELL AND BRIAN ALTMAN At presstime, Congress was still considering budget recon-ciliation legislation that includ-ed language establishing Med-icare coverage of state-licensedprofessional counselors. Amer-ican Counseling Associationmembers are strongly encour-aged to check www.counseling. org/publicpolicy for updates on the status of this legislation andthe possible need for grass-roots support for this provision.This website and the relatedwebsite at http://capwiz.com/ counseling will include infor- mation regarding members ofCongress to contact and sug-gested messages for discussingthe issue. To help familiarize coun- selors with both Medicare andthe legislative process involvedin working to gain recognitionof counselors under this pro-gram, ACA's Office of PublicPolicy and Legislation offers alist of \"frequently asked ques-tions\" (and answers!). For more information, please contact either Brian A:Medicare is the federally run and financed health insur-ance program covering an esti-mated 40 million older Ameri-cans (age 65 and older) andAmericans with disabilities.Medicare is the single largesthealth insurance program in thecountry. It should not be con-fused with Medicaid, the healthinsurance program for low-income uninsured children andfamilies funded jointly by statesand the federal government.States control their Medicaidprograms, including eligibilityand benefits criteria, within cer-tain basic federal guidelines.Congress controls Medicare,although the program is admin-istered in each state by one ormore intermediaries. Q:How do I get a Medicare provider number? A:Right now, you can't. Cur- rently, psychologists and clini-cal social workers are the onlynonphysician mental health pro-fessionals covered under the program. Congress writesMedicare's benefit package. Atpresstime, Congress had yet topass (and the president had yetto sign) legislation establishingMedicare coverage of licensedprofessional counselors. The Senate has passed legisla- tion establishing Medicare cov-erage of state-licensed profes-sional counselors and state-licensed marriage and familytherapists, but this is only thefirst step in the legislativeprocess. Before any legislationcan be enacted, it must beapproved in exactly the sametext and format by three sepa-rate entities: the House of Rep-resentatives, the Senate and thepresident. (The House and Sen-ate can enact legislation byoverriding the president's veto,but this is a rare occurrence.) Q:Since Medicare coverage of counselors has passed theSenate, does this mean it' s goingto become law in a certainamount of time? A:No. The Senate has passed legislative language establish-ing Medicare coverage of coun-selors before, but without subse-quent House approval of thesame language. Each chamber(the Senate and the House ofRepresentatives) routinely pass-es legislation that the otherchamber chooses not to ap-prove. Simply because the Sen-ate has passed something does-n't automatically mean it'sgoing to become law. In this case, the Senate includ- ed a counselor coverage provi-sion in its broad budget recon-ciliation bill, S. 1932. TheHouse budget reconciliation billdoes not include this provision.At presstime, a group of Houseand Senate members was work-ing together to reconcile differ-ences between the two bills. Asmentioned previously, before abill becomes law, the sameexact language must be passedby both the House and the Sen-ate and then be signed by thepresident. The House and Sen-ate conferees on the budget rec-onciliation legislation are work-ing through a long list of con-tentious issues. ACA is working alongside the American Mental Health Coun-selors Association and theAmerican Association for Mar-riage and Family Therapy to seethat the counselor/MFT cover-age provision is retained in theconference report (the name for the compromise version of thelegislation written by theHouse-Senate conferees) devel-oped on the budget reconcilia-tion legislation. Q:If the Medicare language passed by the Senate on coun-selor coverage is enacted,which counselors would be cov-ered? A:The provision passed by the Senate would establishMedicare coverage of state-licensed professional counselorswho have obtained the highestlevel of licensure. Thus, the pro-vision would not apply to anymental health counselors instates without licensure (Cali-fornia and Nevada). Schoolcounselors would receive reim-bursement for services providedto Medicare beneficiaries only ifthey were licensed in their stateas independently practicingmental health counselors. Q:What groups are opposing this provision? A:The only groups we know of opposing Medicare coverageof licensed professional coun-selors and marriage and familytherapists are the American Psy-chiatric Association and theNational Association of SocialWorkers. The opposition ofthese two groups is disappoint-ing, if not surprising. The American Psychiatric Association has a long historyof opposing efforts to expanddirect access to nonphysicianproviders (including psycholo-gists, clinical social workers andlicensed professional coun-selors) under Medicare andother public health programs. The National Association of Social Workers appears to sharethe American Psychiatric Asso-ciation's desire to protect itsmembers' \"turf\" at the expenseof patient access to services.This is despite the strong simi-larities in counselor and socialwork training standards and thefact that clinical social workersare routinely licensed with sig-nificantly less actual graduatecoursework than licensed pro-fessional counselors. Many \u2014 ifnot most \u2014 graduate programsin social work give students asmuch as a full year of credit forbachelor's level coursework. Q:If counselor coverage is enacted, when would it go intoeffect?A:Most likely sometime in 2007. Under the legislationpassed by the Senate, coverageof state-licensed professionalcounselors would begin Jan. 1,2007. However, House and Sen-ate conferees on the measurecould change this date. In addi-tion, the U.S. Department ofHealth and Human Services andits Centers for Medicare andMedicaid Services will needtime to develop regulationsimplementing this and any otherchanges in Medicare law. Theregulatory process is sometimespainfully slow. Q:Would getting Medicare coverage affect reimbursementunder Medicaid? A:Only indirectly. As noted above, states control their Med-icaid programs and have freereign to cover (or not cover)many services and populations.Under federal law, state Medi-caid programs must coverphysicians' services, but theyare not required to cover psy-chologists' services or those ofother nonphysician mentalhealth professionals. Recentbudget shortfalls have forcednearly all states to cut back ontheir Medicaid programs. However, Medicare coverage will help demonstrate to stateofficials that counseling is alegitimate mental health profes-sion. This, combined with coun-selors' cost-effectiveness, maycause more states to establish orexpand coverage of counselorsfor their Medicaid beneficiaries. Q:How would this affect pri- vate health plans? A:Again, only indirectly. Changing the benefit packageof one of the primary publichealth insurance programsdoesn't mean that private sec-tor plans have to change any-thing. However, they will like-ly be more inclined to recog-nize and reimburse licensedprofessional counselors if theyknow we're covered underMedicare. Medicare law pro-hibits \"Medicare+Choice\" managed care plansfrom discriminating againstproviders on the basis of theirtype of license. Q:How much does Medicare pay? A:Medicare is not known for its generous reimbursementrates, and one of the major pol-icy discussions taking place isthe extent to which Medicare's small payments to providersare leading them to stop seeingMedicare clients. Medicarepays for services through acomplex fee schedule that takesinto account the difficulty ofthe service provided, the re-sources necessary to providethe service and geographic costfactors. Medicare generally pays 80 percent of the cost of outpatienttreatment, with the beneficiaryresponsible for the remaining20 percent. However, for out-patient mental health treatment,Medicare only pays 50 percentof the cost, with the beneficiaryresponsible for the other half.This inequitable copaymentrequirement remains un-changed in both the House- andSenate-passed bills. The Senate's bill would pay state-licensed professionalcounselors and marriage andfamily therapists at the samerates as clinical social workers.If and when this provision isenacted into law, counselorscan find out what Medicarepayment rates are for outpatientmental health services in theirarea by contacting their state'sMedicare carrier. Q:Can I do anything to help Medicare coverage of coun-selors become law? A:We think so! As stated previously, either check the ACA website at www. counseling.org/publicpolicy or contact Brian Altman withACA's Office of Public Policyand Legislation at 800.347.6647 ext. 242 or via e-mail atbaltman@counseling.org to get an update on the status of thislegislation.

Bill Thomas)and Energy and CommerceCommittee (Rep. Joe Barton)to express support for Medicarecoverage of licensed profes-sional counselors.

The competitionengages graduate counselingstudents (master's and doctorallevel) in critically analyzing apotential ethical case and creat-ing an appropriate ethical deci-sion-making plan to respond tothe ethical situation. The ACA Ethics Committee will begin accepting registra-tions for its second annual virtu-al case study competition formaster's and doctoral level stu-dents in counselor educationprograms beginning Feb. 1. Theregistration deadline is noonEastern time on Feb. 15. Team structure and rules Members of the Ethics Com- mittee will create two mock eth-ical scenarios, one for master'sstudents and one for doctoralstudents, with each addressing acurrent ethical issue facing thecounseling profession. Teamsmay be composed of three tofour master's students or threeto four doctoral students en-rolled in the same counseloreducation program. Master'sand doctoral student teams willbe judged in two separate cate-gories. Each team must alsohave a faculty member to serveas an administrative contact per-son for the institution. Otherpertinent information regardingteam structure and rules: 1.

He was alsoinstrumental in efforts to establish aNative American vice president withinAMCD and went on to serve in thatcapacity. \"I have known hundreds of ACA mem- bers over my 30-plus years with the asso-ciation, and there is nobody I respected ortrusted more than Roger,\" said Janet WindWalker Jones, a former Native Americanvice president in AMCD. \"In my experi-ence, he was a man of deep convictionsand very private ways. He lived his beliefsand honored his ancestors and his peopleevery day. He steadfastly walked the pathof his people and his convictions, andconstantly did things for others withoutcalling attention to himself for it.\" She continued, \"Roger gave all that he had within him to his students, his readers,his professional colleagues and hisfriends. All he asked for in return washonesty and integrity in what others saidand did. He was multicultural within him-self and very proud of his native ancestry,just as I am. He worked tirelessly fornative people, for social justice in theworld, and for social justice and multicul-tural awareness in the counseling profes-sion. ... He walked his path true to theend, left much good behind and sits in aseat of great honor with his ancestors.\" John Joseph Peregoy, an assistant pro- fessor in the Department of Counseling,Leadership, Adult and Higher Educationat Morehead State University, also formeda bond with Herring. \"It was in Pittsburgh for the ACA Conference in the 1990s\"when they first met, Peregoy said. \"Weboth were at an AMCD mixer and justkind of ran into each other, both smokingtobacco. We eyed each other to see if therewas any recognition. We introduced our-selves and of course talked Indian issues.But before we got to the topical discus-sion, and after I introduced myself, hesaid, 'Oh, you wrote \"Stress and theSheepskin\" (the title of my dissertation).You did a real nice job on it.' Well, let metell you, as a new Ph.D. at the time, I wasimpressed that anybody read it, let aloneRoger Herring, a pioneer in championingissues of American Indian mental healthand school counseling issues. \"Since that time, Roger and I had devel- oped a good working relationship, valuingeach other's opinions on professionalissues, issues in Indian country and sim-ply the mundane. I will miss him. I havesmoked the pipe and prayed for his spirit'sjourney to the other side. He has had animpact on many people in ACA and inAMCD. His legacy will live on.\" Herring was the recipient of numerous awards throughout his career, includingthe ACA Research Award in 1999 and theCounselors for Social Justice 'OhanaAward for his efforts in the area of cross-cultural counseling in 1993. \"As you can readily see, Roger was not only a prolific writer,\" Runion said. \"Hewas also extensively involved in histeaching, presenting, service to his profes-sional organizations and his academiccommunity, and service to his personalcommunity of Native American Indians.He will be sorely missed not only for hisprofessional contributions but also for allhis contributions to his university commu-nity, to native-born communities and,most importantly of all, missed as afriend.\" Said Ginter, \"I want to end by saying that Roger taught me the importance ofperseverance. That embracing a purposein life and then approaching that purposewith steady persistence enables one towithstand many of the difficulties, dis-couragements and obstacles associatedwith being human. And most important,this approach to life can enable us toreveal what has been referred to as the'better angels of our nature.'\" Herring's surviving family members include his wife, Cynthia Maughn Her-ring; his mother, Willie Mae Herring; adaughter, Cassandra Ford; and a sister,Judy Herring Wallace. IRoger Herring, professor emeritus of counselor education at the University ofArkansas-Little Rock, an American Coun-seling Association author and a notedauthority on multicultural and NativeAmerican issues in counseling, died Nov.8, 2005, in Laurnburg, N.C. He was 61. Herring taught at Arkansas-Little Rock from July 1989 until his departure lastsummer. \"The focus of his higher educa-tion career was to promote greater aware-ness of and appreciation for the needs ofour ethnically and culturally diverse pop-ulation with a particular emphasis onNative American Indians, his own cultur-al background,\" said Keith B. Runion, aprofessor in the Department of Counsel-ing, Adult and Rehabilitation Education atUALR. Runion said Herring was a mem-ber of the Catawba tribe. During his time at UALR, Herring also proved to be a prolific writer. He authoredtwo books for ACA \u2014 Multicultural Counseling in Schools: A SynergeticApproach and Career Counseling in Schools: Multicultural and Developmen-tal Perspectives . He was also well-known in counseling circles for authoring twoother books, Counseling With Native American Indians and Alaska Natives and Counseling Diverse Ethnic Youth: Syner-getic Strategies and Interventions forSchool Counselors . In addition, he co- authored a book of poetry, Corners of the Heart , with Vada L. Singletary. His love of writing also carried over to journal articles. \"To give you a sense ofjust how productive he was,\" Runion said,\"he published, by my admittedly incom- plete count, at least 66 articles or contribu-tions to edited works. He is having at leastone article published posthumously. ...One element of all this publishing thatRoger was tremendously proud of washow often he was cited by other authors.Once again, by my assuredly incompletecount, this occurred at least 87 times.Many of the authors are principal writersin the field of counseling.\" In addition,Herring had previously served as editor ofthe Journal of Humanistic Counseling, Education and Development , published by the Counseling Association for Hu-manistic Education and Development,and was a member of the ACA Publica-tions Committee. \"Roger was able to write about things that were meaningful to readers becausehe wrote about things that were meaning-ful to him,\" said Earl J. Ginter, consultingeditor for ACA's Journal of Counseling & Development . \"Early in Roger's life, he was driven to understand 'who he was,'which initially led him to seek affiliationwith his mother's Cherew tribe. At anearly age Roger became acutely aware ofthe profound effects of racial and classdiscrimination, and as a result dedicatedhis life to helping adolescents, and others,expected to lose in a conflict because ofsocial or political injustice. Roger is awonderful example of how lookinginward can lead one to discover a reasonfor writing. These are the types of writerswho leave a lasting mark on the profes-sional literature.\" Author and educator Herring dies at age 61 UALR professor wrote extensively on both multicultural, Native American issues Counseling T oday IJanuary 2006 57and 1977, respectively. Naturally creative, she was an artist and painter. She lovedreading, movies and music, and was anavid swimmer and diver who once wasfeatured in an old-time newsreel film. Niel Carey came to value Pinson- Millburn as a friend and colleague dur-ing his time as the state coordinator ofcareer education in Maryland and lateras the first executive director of theNational Career Development Associa-tion. In particular, he recalled her workas a member of the Maryland StateDepartment of Education's career edu-cation team. Pinson-Millburn played amajor role in planning and producing theMaryland TV series Calling Careers , he said, and contributed to several impor-tant career education publications,including Career Education: What It Is and How to Do It . \"Maryland's career education program received nationalrecognition,\" Carey said, \"and Nancy'sdiligent and creative work was clearly amajor factor in that success.\" \"When I became NCDA's executive director and was given the responsibilityfor establishing an NCDA office at ACAheadquarters,\" Carey continued, \"Nancybecame a constant source of information,encouragement and support. Her doorwas always open, and her expertise inmatters related to legislation, ethics, cer-tification, accreditation or publicationswas impressive and very helpful. ... Forme, Nancy Pinson-Millburn will serve asa role model of the dedicated counselingprofessional whose work and service hashad a major positive impact on our pro-fession, on those we serve and on thelives of her friends and colleagues.\" \"If it were not for Nancy,\" said Lee Richmond, a past president of ACA, \"Iwould never have gotten involved inNCDA, ACA, NBCC, Shedid the same for Richmond andPinson-Millburn also teamed up (alongwith Michael Bender) on the bookCareers, Computers and the Handi-capped . \"Mike and I needed someone who could really edit and really write,\"Richmond said. \"Nancy was that person.\" \"Here is what I know of Nancy,\" Rich- mond continued. \"She was not only intel-ligent, but also sharp. She could be fear-less. She enjoyed giving others a leg up,and she loved the counseling profession.\" Pinson-Millburn also treasured her relationships, both personal and profes-sional, said Nancy K. Schlossberg, pro-fessor emerita in the Department ofCounseling and Personnel Services at theUniversity of Maryland and author ofRetire Smart, Retire Happy: Finding Your True Path . When Schlossberg joined the faculty at the University of Maryland in1974, Pinson-Millburn was working onher dissertation. Schlossberg served asher doctoral adviser, and they becamegood friends. In the mid-1990s, after Pin-son-Millburn left ACA, she went to workfor Schlossberg at the university's Centerof Human Services Development. \"Ourlives were interlaced \u2014 both our person-al lives and our professional lives,\"Schlossberg said. \"Nancy was a personwho was very much a part of my life andone of the most supportive people I'veknown. She just kept the relationshipmoving all the time. Nancy was the kindof person who sent cards, sent notes, sentflowers. She didn't do shortcuts (in herrelationships).\" Survivors include her beloved husband of 24 years, George P. Millburn; her threeadult children, Mark Pinson of Weymouth, George P. Millburn Jr. ofOrange, Calif.; and six grandchildren. A memorial service celebrating her life was held Dec. 3, 2005, at the MemorialChapel on the University of Marylandcampus. The family has established the Nancy M. Pinson-Millburn Memorial Scholar-ship in Counselor Education at the Uni-versity of Maryland to honor her legacyas a leading counselor education advo-cate. Contributions should be sent to:Nancy M. Pinson-Millburn MemorialScholarship Fund in Counselor Educa-tion, c/o College of Education, Building, University of Maryland,College Park, MD 20742. ACA con-tributed the first gift to the memorialscholarship in appreciation of the contri-bution that Pinson-Millburn made both tothe association and the profession ofcounseling. \"Nancy was an energetic, inquisitive and thoughtful person who led with dis-tinction and intellect,\" said Richard Yep,who worked for Pinson-Millburn at ACAbefore becoming the association's execu-tive director. \"She brought an energy andprofessionalism that we had not seen inawhile. She related well to all of us,regardless of whether we were older oryounger than she was, and she was cer-tainly knowledgeable on the issues.\" INancy M. Pinson-Millburn, 78, a nationally known counseling executiveand consultant, died of cancer-relatedcomplications on Nov. 24, 2005, at theKline Hospice House in Mount Airy, Md. Before retiring in 1994, she served as a senior consultant to the Center of HumanServices Development at the Universityof Maryland-College Park, where sheworked to recognize and support thegrowing number of grandparents andother kinship caregivers nationwide whoare raising their grandchildren due toparental failure, neglect or illness. Previ-ously, she had served for seven years asan assistant executive director at theAmerican Counseling Association, whereshe had responsibility for eight profes-sional departments. Earlier in her career, Pinson-Millburn had worked for the state of Maryland invocational guidance and research, train-ing counselors and educators in the state's24 school systems. Following her 11-yeartenure in state government, she worked atthe University of Maryland, where shewas program director for all U.S. RegionIII rehabilitation training programs. Sheheld principal responsibility for a majornational study of blindness and visual ser-vices, with emphasis on affected residentsin Pennsylvania. The study's findings andrelated reports are still being utilized asbaselines for current research with thesepopulations. Pinson-Millburn came on board at ACA (then the American Personnel andGuidance Association and later the Amer-ican Association for Counseling andDevelopment) as an Institute for Educa-tion and Learning intern under formerExecutive Director Chuck Lewis. \"Shehad a deep commitment to everything shewas doing,\" Lewis remembers. \"I can'tsay it enough, she was exceptionallybright. She was an outstanding person.\" When Joe McDonough became the association's executive director, he chosePinson-Millburn as an assistant executivedirector. \"I found her to be a very capableperson and one I'm going to miss,\"McDonough said. \"She was a person whogot things done. I think she was veryesteemed by her colleagues every placethat she worked.\" That esteem was aresult not only of her knowledge and abil-ity, he said, but of the way she treatedpeople. \"She cared a lot about the peoplewho worked for her and paid attention towhat they said,\" McDonough related.\"She was an extremely caring person.That was one of her best attributes. It would be hard to find a person whowould say anything negative about her.\" Nettie Baldwin, who worked side-by- side with Pinson-Millburn in the earlynineties as an assistant executive directorat ACA, also remembers how well herformer colleague related to others.\"Beyond her accomplishment as a schol-ar and researcher,\" Baldwin said, \"Nancyhad people skills. She had those qualitiesthat reached out to people. She wasalways accepting, inviting and encourag-ing. You respected her, and she respectedyou. That crossed all barriers.\" Baldwin also recalled Pinson- Millburn's love of dance and the specialrelationship she shared with her hus-band, George Millburn. \"Nancy had aspirit about her,\" Baldwin said. \"Sheseemed to be very happy. She just knewhow to live. She also was a person whohad the courage to speak out about whatshe believed, and she took risks.\" Pinson-Millburn coauthored and edited eight books and numerous journal articlesabout counseling, supervision and careerdevelopment. She traveled extensivelyand was active internationally as aspokesperson for responsible and ethicalcounseling practice. Her advocacy forpolicy supporting underserved popula-tions led to national legislation ensuringthe inclusion of counseling services inmany federally funded educational pro-grams. Among the commendations shereceived were eight awards from her pro-fessional colleagues and citations fromthe U.S. Department of Education, thePublic Broadcasting System, Pi LambdaTheta, Who' s Who in the East and the Institute for Educational Leadership. She was a national board-certified coun- selor with Maryland licensure and a mem-ber of ACA, the American PsychologicalAssociation and the National MentalHealth Association. She also served on theeditorial boards of three American coun-seling journals and one international jour-nal based in the Netherlands. Pinson-Millburn, a resident of Freder- ick, Md., and Venice, Fla., was born onDec. 17, 1926, in Newtonville, Mass. Shegraduated from Florida State Universitybefore pursuing positions in education,including as a physical education andmodern dance teacher at the WashingtonCathedral School for Girls.
