Enforcement of these requirements has nearly eliminated vaccine-preventable diseases that in the past caused significant illness and death. This success is the direct result of the tremendous partnerships that have developed among school and child care facility personnel, health care professionals, and parents. This updated version of the Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual (Third Edition) was prepared as a guide for the many individuals who have a role in ensuring our children are protected from vaccine-preventable diseases. It was designed to standardize procedures and problem-solve complex issues so that school and child care facility laws and regulations could be implemented in a consistent manner. We recognize that immunization schedules are very complicated and, at times, consultation with the Alaska Immunization Program will be required to determine if a child has met requirements or if additional immunizations are needed. If you have any questions concerning immunization requirements, please call the Alaska Immunization Program at (907) 269-8000, or contact your local public health clinic. Thank you for your continued support and commitment to ensure that Alaska's children do not suffer the consequences of diseases that can be prevented safely and effectively.Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third EditionAlaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third EditionSchool and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual: A Guide for Implementing Alaska's Immunization Requirements TABLE OF CONTENTS Page I.

Why does Alaska have school and child care facility immunization requirements? Before immunization requirements for school and child care attendance were strictly enforced, many Alaska children suffered from vaccine-preventable diseases. The effects of these vaccine-preventable illnesses ranged from minor inconveniences to death; at a minimum, they disrupted school and child care attendance and caused logistical problems for parents. The goal of the immunization requirements is to assure that all children receive maximum protection against these preventable diseases. How does the State determine the required immunization schedule? Alaska's immunization schedules are based upon the \"Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule\" developed by the national Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The ACIP's membership includes representatives from both public health and the private medical sector (including the American Academy of Pediatrics). To establish Alaska's schedule, the Alaska Immunization Program evaluates the ACIP recommendations and determines their appropriateness/feasibility for Alaska's unique situations. Why are immunization requirements different from state to state? Each state considers the ACIP recommendations and evaluates them in light of their own circumstances and available resources. This allows variation between states based upon local needs. Who is responsible for proper immunization compliance? Parents/Guardians: Are responsible for obtaining all age appropriate immunizations for their children and providing valid immunization records to the school/child care facility. Principal/Preschool, Head Start or Child Care Facility Operator: Has the responsibility to ensure children attending the school/child care facility are in compliance with Alaska immunization requirements. This includes assuring that parents have submitted complete and valid immunization records, that these records are on file at the school or child care facility, and that follow-up with parents to obtain additional information (records or doses) is accomplished, when necessary. Shall not allow a child to attend the facility until he/she is in compliance. Shall exclude non-compliant children and notify parents or guardians in person, by phone, or in writing (certified letter, if necessary) that their child is non-compliant with the survey. Should submit Alaska Annual Immunization Self-Assessment Survey.Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third Edition Page \u00181 Exemptions may be granted for medical or religious reasons. What criteria are used to determine if a child is in compliance with Alaska's immunization requirements? In order to determine if a child meets the requirements of Alaska immunization regulations, the following must be considered: the child's age; whether the child attends school (K-\u0018\u0018) or a licensed child care facility/certified preschool/Head Start program; whether the child's vaccine history indicates: (a) verification by a medical provider (b) complete dates for all doses received (c) sufficient spacing between doses. These variables make it difficult to describe all possible situations that a school or child care facility might encounter in its efforts to maintain compliance with the regulations and limit the spread of vaccine- preventable diseases. If you have questions about a child's record, please call the Alaska Immunization Program at \u001869-8000 for consultation.Which vaccines are needed for a child or student to meet Alaska immunization requirements? The following chart outlines current vaccine immunization requirements. Additional criteria must be considered to determine the appropriate number of doses for each child. (Outlined in the following section.) Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Requirements1 (# doses required varies/see next section) VaccineFacility Type School Care Facility/ Head (DTP, DTaP, DT, Td) Measles/Mumps/Rubella (MMR) Hepatitis Hepatitis B Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) Varicella (\"chickenpox\") Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third Edition Page \u0018Why do children of different ages need different types of vaccines or different numbers of doses? Optimal response to a vaccine depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the vaccine and the age and immune status of the recipient. Recommendations for the age at which vaccines are administered are influenced by age-specific risks of disease, age-specific risks of complications, ability of persons of a given age to respond to the vaccine, and potential interference with the immune response by maternal antibody. In general, vaccines are recommended for the youngest age group at risk for developing the disease who can develop an adequate antibody response to the specific vaccine. Are the immunization requirements different for children attending a certified preschool versus those in a licensed child care facility? No. There is no difference in the immunization requirements mandated for these two types of facilities. How are school/child care facility records verified by the Department of Health and Social Services? Annual assessment of the immunization status of children in Alaska's schools and child care facilities has greatly reduced the number of vaccine-preventable diseases occurring in the State. Although a portion of schools/child care facilities receive on-site assessments from Immunization Program staff, it is not possible to visit all facilities each year; thus, the self-assessment program plays a critical role in determining the immunization status of Alaska's children. It also provides schools/child care facilities with a means to check the records of children in attendance and assure their protection against disease. Self-Assessment Program Each year all schools and child care facilities receive an Alaska Annual Immunization Self-Assessment Survey form. This form may be filled out by hand or computer-generated using a FREE software application (Self ImmAGE ) available from the Alaska Immunization Program. The information provided is evaluated to monitor compliance with state immunization regulations. Individual self-assessment results may be reported to the appropriate licensing/certifying agency or department and summary information is reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Because the self-assessment survey is completed and submitted to the Immunization Program by school and child care facility staff, the results from the self-assessment may vary from those found by the auditors during an on-site audit. For this reason, self-assessment compliance rates and on-site audit compliance rates may differ.Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third Edition Page \u0018On-Site Audits Each year a number of schools, preschools, and child care facilities are visited by state immunization staff who review records to ensure children meet immunization requirements. The goal of these visits is to assure adequate protection of Alaska's children while improving immunization procedures. A major emphasis of these visits is to provide assistance in solving any immunization problems . Upon completion of the review, an exit interview with appropriate facility staff is conducted to discuss the findings and answer any questions. A list of children identified as not meeting requirements, including an explanation as to what is needed, is left with the facility. A list indicating these children have been brought into compliance with the immunization requirements must be submitted to the Immunization Program within 30 days after the audit. A final report of the facility's immunization compliance status is submitted to the appropriate licensing or certifying agency and, in the case of public schools, to the superintendent of the school district. Where should the completed audit/self assessment reports be sent? All immunization reports should be sent to: Alaska Immunization Program \u001860\u0018 \"C\" Street - Suite 5\u00180 Anchorage, AK 9950\u0018 How should a facility report the occurence of a vaccine-preventable disease? School and child care immunization requirements have nearly eliminated vaccine-preventable childhood diseases. However, outbreaks still occur and can cause mild to serious illnesses, which result in lost time from school/work for children, parents, and teachers/facility staff, as well as cause potentially high medical expenses. Health professionals, including those in school and child care settings, are required to report certain infectious diseases to public health authorities. (A complete list of reportable diseases may be obtained from the Alaska Section of Epidemiology.) Schools and child care facilities without health care providers on site are requested to report diagnosed or suspected vaccine-preventable disease, especially those accompanied by rash and fever, by calling (907) \u001869-8000 during business hours or \u0018-800-\u001878-008\u0018 after hours.Alaska Immunization Requirements: Reference ChartsAlaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third Edition Page 5What are the names of some common vaccines/vaccine combinations\u00b6 that might be found on a child's immunization record, and what diseases do they protect against?

Doses received after the \"maximum\" intervals are medically acceptable and bring the child back into agreement with compliance standards. TO DETERMINE IF A CHILD'S IMMUNIZATIONS ARE in compliAnce , PLEASE REFER TO THE CHARTS ON THE FOLLOWING SIX PAGES.Why does the medically recommended schedule for vaccines differ from the school and child care facility compliance requirements? What is the difference between when a vaccine is medically recommended and what is required to remain in compliance with Alaska Immunization Regulations? State of Alaska law requires that Alaska children be appropriately immunized in order to attend school or child care. The legal requirements for COmPLIANCE with the immunization standards represent the minimal acceptable immunization standards. This differs from the mEDICALLY rECOmmENDED schedule, which represents the ideal time for a child to receive an immunization. Medical recommendations are based on the time schedule that has been shown to be effective in protecting children from vaccine-preventable diseases. School and child care compliance standards utilize the medical recommendations, but they allow some leeway both before and after the recommended schedule. EXAMPLE: The medical recommendation calls for a second dose of DTaP to be given 2 months after the first dose. however, the interval may be as little as one month and still provide adequate protection for a child. Therefore, to remain in compliance , the dose should be received at least one month after the previous dose. Since the recommended time for receipt is \u0018 months, compliance standards allow for this \u0018 month interval plus an additional month to ensure the child has had adequate time to visit a health care provider. IIlustration: DTaP#1 DTaP#2Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third Edition Page 8For compliance purposes (applies to charts on pages 8-10): Age = age in calendar weeks or months ( e.g., \"by 6 wks of age\" or \"by \u0018 mos of age\") Interval between doses calculated as \u00188 days = \u0018 month \"maximum\" (under Required spacing) - refers to the maximum time period before a child who has not completed the required number of doses would be \"out of compliance.\" Doses received after the \"maximum\" intervals are medically acceptable and bring the child back into agreement with compliance standards.

(Although varicella immunization or a history of varicella disease is not required for children in grades K- \u0018\u0018 in a school setting, it is required for children of any age attending a licensed child care facility .) \"Kindergarten\" - For the purposes of these guidelines, a \"child in kindergarten\" is one who was born by August \u00185th at least five years prior to kindergarten entry. For example, a child entering kindergarten in \u0018005 must have been born before August \u00185, \u0018000.

Hib vaccine has almost completely elimi - nated the incidence of Hib disease in this country. Appropriate use of this important vaccine requires consideration of several factors, including: AGE - Both the child's current age and the age at which he/she received prior doses affect the recom - mendations for future doses of Hib vaccine. BRAND OF VACCINE USED - At least three brands of Hib vaccine currently are licensed in the United States. For children beginning Hib immunization in infancy, two brands require \u0018 total doses, while one requires only \u0018. For purposes of compliance , the \u0018-dose schedule shown below will be used, regardless of the type of vaccine received. Child Care, Preschool, & Head Start Page 3 of 3 Alaska Immunization Compliance Standards FOR CHILD CARE FACILITIES, PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS, AND HEAD START PROGRAMS Note: HIB is required only for children under 5 years of age Dose #Hib CURRENT AgeRequired spacing minimum maximum 16 wks - 59 mos Not valid before 6 wks of age By \u0018 mos of age 26 wks - 11 mos \u0018 mo after #\u0018 \u0018 mos after #\u0018 \u0018 after #\u0018 \u0018 mos after #\u0018 and by \u00186 mos of age 36 wks - 11 mos Not counted for compliance if received before \u0018\u0018 mos of ageNot applicable 12-59 mos \u0018 mos after #\u0018 (Not counted for compliance if received before \u0018\u0018 mos of age)\u0018 mos after #\u0018 and by \u00186 mos of age An additional dose is required if: Minimum spacing requirements are not met. An additional dose is NOT required if: Child received at least one dose between \u00185-59 mos of age. Child received at least \u0018 valid doses before \u0018\u0018 mos of age and an appropriately spaced \u0018rd dose between \u0018\u0018-\u0018\u0018 mos of age. Child is 5 yrs of age and older. + If a child received dose # \u0018 after \u0018\u0018 mos of age, a minimum of \u0018 mos is required between dose #1 and #2. To remain in compliance, the child must receive dose #2 a maximum of \u0018 mos after dose #\u0018 and by \u00186 months of age. If this child receives dose #\u0018 at least \u0018 mos after dose #\u0018, no additional doses are needed.Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third Edition Page \u0018\u0018How do I use the Hib chart (on p. 10) to determine compliance? (1) Determine how many valid doses ( i.e., those meeting minimum age and spacing standards) a child has received. (2) Go to the next dose number on the chart. (For example, if a child's record indicates he has received one valid dose, go to the information about dose #\u0018.) (3) In the appropriate dose number row, find the child's current age to determine the minimum/maximum spacing standards necessary for compliance. EXAMPLES: SAM: Current Age - \u00180 mos Hib vaccine history - \u0018 dose at \u0018 mos of age (\u0018) Sam has received one valid dose. (\u0018) Go to the row for the next dose (#\u0018). (\u0018) Choose the appropriate age range (6 wks-\u0018\u0018 mos) and then go to the spacing columns. It has been more than \u0018 month since Sam received dose #\u0018, so he is beyond the minimum spacing. It also has been more than \u0018 months since he received dose #\u0018, so he has passed the maximum for compliance. Result: Sam is out of compliance and must receive his \u0018nd dose at this time. MARY: Current Age - \u0018\u0018 mos Hib vaccine history - \u0018 dose at each of these ages - \u0018 mos, \u0018 mos, 8 mos (\u0018) Mary has received \u0018 doses of vaccine. However, not all of them count for compliance. (See below.) (\u0018) Go to the row for dose #\u0018. Mary received her \u0018rd dose before she was \u0018\u0018 months of age, so it cannot be counted for compliance . (\u0018) Since Mary still needs a valid dose #\u0018, in the dose #\u0018 row, choose the appropriate age range (\u0018\u0018-59 mos) for her current age, and then go to the spacing columns. (\u0018) It has been more than \u0018 mos since Mary received dose #\u0018, so she has passed the minimum spacing requirement. (5) It has been more than \u0018 mos since Mary received dose #\u0018, but she is not yet \u00186 mos of age. Result: Mary may receive her \u0018rd valid dose now or at any time before \u00186 months of age. If she has not received the dose before she reaches \u00186 mos of age, she will have passed the \"maximum\" and will be out of compliance. BILL: Current Age - \u0018\u0018 mos Hib vaccine history - \u0018 dose at \u0018\u0018 mos of age (\u0018) Bill has received \u0018 valid dose. (\u0018) Go to the row for the next dose (#\u0018). (\u0018) Choose the appropriate age range (\u0018\u0018-\u0018\u0018 mos), then go to the spacing columns. (\u0018) It has been more than \u0018 month since Bill received dose #\u0018, so the chart appears to indicate that he may receive his next dose now. However, the footnote (+) refers to the special circumstances represented by Bill. Because he received his \u0018st dose after \u0018\u0018 mos of age, at least 2 mos are required between his \u0018st and \u0018nd doses. Result: Bill currently is in compliance. As soon as \u0018 months have elapsed since his \u0018st dose, he needs to receive his \u0018nd dose of vaccine. If he has not received the \u0018nd dose by \u0018 months after #\u0018, he will be out of compliance. As shown in the footnote, Bill's \u0018nd dose will complete his Hib requirement; no additional doses will be needed. JOHN: Current Age - \u00186 mos Hib vaccine history - No prior doses of vaccine (\u0018) John has never received any Hib vaccine. (\u0018) As noted in the chart footnotes, one dose received after \u00185 mos of age completes the series. Result: John needs one dose of vaccine now, and then his Hib immunization requirement will be met. He needs no further doses.

RECORDS What records are required for school/child care entry? All children enrolled in public/private schools, licensed child care facilities, certified preschools, and head Start programs muST have an immunization record that is medically verified and which documents all doses and dates for all required vaccines received . Before a child enters a school/child care facility, parents must present his/her immunization record that provides: the name of each required vaccine; the date (month/day/year) of each dose received; written verification of all doses by a physician, clinic, or other authorized medical provider. NOTE: Unverified records or records signed only by a parent/guardian are not valid documentation of immunizations. What is meant by a \"medically verified record\"? The parent or guardian of the child must provide a copy of a shot record verified by a medical provider that indicates the date(s) of all immunizations the child has received. School immunization records signed by a school nurse are considered medically verified records. School immunization records that are not verified by a clinic/health care provider are not \"medically verified,\" and additional records will be needed. A facsimile (\"fax\") record from a medical provider is acceptable as a verified medical record. can an immunization record be verified by telephone with a medical provider 's office? No. A valid written immunization record must be maintained on file at the school or child care facility. [Note: A facsimile (\"fax\") record from a medical provider is acceptable as a verified medical record.] Should a facility consider a partial record and/or statement signed by a physician stating \"All doses received\", \"Complete\", \"Up to Date\", \"Primary series complete\", or other similar statements to be a valid immunization record? No. Statements about immunizations that do not contain dates for each vaccine received are NOT adequate for attendance or as a medical exemption. The parent should contact his/her physician and request a new record documenting all vaccinations and dates administered. Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third Edition Page \u00186can a school or child care facility maintain immunization records in a computer database onl Y? No. Although a computerized file may be developed for the convenience of the school/child care facility, a copy of a written immunization record verified by a medical provider also must be maintained for each child in the facility. Can a child be admitted to a child care facility provisionally, while waiting on an immunization record? All children admitted to child care facilities are required to have an immunization record upon entry. The only potential exceptions to this requirement are: 1) Alaska Immunization regulation \u0018 AAC 6\u0018.\u001850(c)(\u0018) states that children are allowed to be placed in the facility for one visit only . The parent or guardian must provide the child care facility with an appropriate immunization record on the second visit. 2) If a child registers for child care entry in a community where regular medical services are not available on at least a weekly basis, he/she may be provisionally admitted for a reasonable time for the prevailing circumstances, but not exceeding 60 days after enrollment (\u0018 AAC 6\u0018.\u001850). Any such provisional exceptions must be reported by the child care facility to the Alaska Immunization Program at 269-8000. Can a child be admitted to a school provisionally, while waiting on an immunization record? All children admitted to school are required to have an immunization record upon entry. The only exception in which provisional admittance may be allowed is if a child registers for school in a community where regular medical services are not available on at least a weekly basis. He/she may be provisionally admitted for a reasonable time for the prevailing circumstances, but not exceeding 90 days after enrollment (\u0018 AAC 06.055). Any such provisional exceptions must be reported by the school to the Alaska Immunization Program at 269-8000. Are transfer students required to provide immunization documentation before being admitted into a new school? Yes. Before entry , all children transferring from one Alaska school to another or from schools outside Alaska to an Alaska school are required to provide the new school with a date and dose specific, medically verified immunization record. (Note: School immunization records signed by a school nurse are considered medically verified records. School immunization records that are not verified by a clinic/health care provider are not \"medically verified,\" and additional records will be needed.)Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third Edition Page \u00187What should be done if a parent is adamant that his/her child has been vaccinated, but the record was lost or cannot be obtained? Children without records cannot be admitted . It is the parents' responsibility to have medically verified immunization records for their children. Several options are available to the facility/parent in this situation. The parent can call his/her child's primary health care provider and obtain a new record. A child may be vaccinated (in an age appropriate fashion) with one dose of each required vaccine. The facility then has the responsibility to follow up with the parent to ensure that written records or additional vaccines are received in a timely manner. (See pp. 8 - \u0018\u0018.) It is the parents' responsibility to provide the valid immunization records. Proof of immunity may be obtained through laboratory testing, as outlined on p. \u00180. A medical exemption may be obtained, if appropriate, from an Alaska-licensed medical doctor (MD), doctor of osteopathy (DO), advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) or physician assistant (PA). Other health care providers, such as registered nurses, chiropractors and naturopaths are not authorized to sign medical exemptions. The Medical Exemption Form on p. \u00187 can be used for this purpose. (If exemption forms are not used, refer to the exemption section on p. \u00189.) Alaska immunization regulation \u0018 AAC 6\u0018.\u001850(c)(\u0018) states entry for one day only is allowed for a child attending a child care facility for the first time. This child must have a valid immunization record on the second visit to the facility. Are child care facilities required to maintain immunization records for children who also attend school? Yes. A current immunization record must be maintained on EVE rY child attending the child care facility. Are child care facilities required to maintain varicella and Hib immunization records for children who also attend school? Regardless of their age, children who attend a licensed child care facility must have a record indicating varicella vaccine has been received or documenting a history of varicella disease. School-aged children do not need documentation of Hib immunization because hib vaccine is not given to children five years of age or older. (For more information, see \"Important Notes about School-age Children in a Child Care Setting\" on p. 9.) Are schools required to maintain immunization records for preschool children? Yes. Preschool children attending a public or private school must have an immunization record on file with the school. Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third Edition Page \u00188Are schools required to assure that correspondence students and/or students who participate in organized school-sponsored activities (e.g., band or an athletic team) meet state immunization requirements? Students who attend school ONLY by correspondence are not required to be immunized. However, all students who PHYSICALLY attend school (including \"correspondence\" students who might attend for short periods of time) or participate in organized school activities must meet Alaska immunization requirements. When should immunization records be reviewed to determine \"out of compliance\" status of children? The time to first assess a child's immunization status is upon school/child care entry. At that time, a listing should be established to serve as a reminder tool for children needing additional doses of vaccine at a later date. This would provide facilities with an easy method for determining \"out of compliance\" status based upon their own reminder system. A facility also might need to take into account the availability of health care services, i.e., more remote locations with infrequent health care access might want to check on compliance status immediately before the arrival of the health care provider, so that children in need of immunizations could be brought up to date. When should records be reviewed to determine compliance with the 10-year Td (tetanus- diphtheria) booster? There is no minimum spacing requirement for this booster. Therefore, a child is in compliance with Alaska immunization law until 10 years have elapsed since his/her last DTaP (or other diphtheria-tetanus vaccine formulation). Schools may establish their own methodology to determine that all students have received a Td booster within the previous 10 years. many find this is most easily accomplished by reviewing a particular cohort such as a grade, age, etc., and notifying parents that a booster is due. However, keep in mind that children remain in compliance with Alaska immunization law and cannot be excluded unless 10 years have elapsed since the last DTaP (or other diphtheria-tetanus vaccine formulation) was received. Exclusion prior to \u00180 years for this immunization is not supported by Alaska's immunization requirements. How should a facility deal with an immunization record from a foreign country, i.e., when the record is in a foreign language or is not date/dose specific? Immunization requirements are the same for all children. Translation support for foreign records is available through the Immunization Program at (907) \u001869-8000. Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third Edition Page \u00189EXEMPTIONS Are there any allowable exemptions to Alaska immunization requirements? Alaska's School and Child Care Immunization Regulations (pp. \u00187-\u00180) allow limited exemptions to the immunization requirements, when submitted with the following designated information: a) Medical - a statement signed by a medical doctor (MD), doctor of osteopathy (DO), advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) or physician assistant (PA) licensed to practice in Alaska affirming that in his/her professional opinion immunization would be injurious to the health of the child or members of his family or household. b) Religious - an affidavit signed by the child's parent or guardian affirming that immunization conflicts with the tenets and practices of the church or religious denomination of which the applicant is a member. NOTE: Personal or philosophical exemptions are NOT accepted. The Immunization Program encourages use of the medical and religious exemption forms found on p. 37 (medical) and p. \u00188 (religious). Although the form itself is not required for either type of exemption, a religious exemption request must contain the exact wording as detailed in the immunization regulations. A list should be kept of all exempt children , including those children in a waiting period. In the event of an outbreak, these children must be quickly identified and encouraged to receive appropriate vaccinations or be excluded. Which state regulations require that an Alaska-licensed mD, Do, Anp or pA sign the medical exemption? The state regulations that deal with medical exemptions are 4 AAC 06.055(b)(2) and 4 AAC 62.450(c) (\u0018). See pp. \u00187-\u00180. What should be done when a child did not receive a needed immunization because he/she was sick? The child's mD, DO, ANP or PA must provide a written medical exemption statement to the parent. The parent/guardian is responsible for providing a copy of this medical exemption statement to the school/ child care facility, where it will remain on file. Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third Edition Page \u00180What should be done if parents do not want their child(ren) to receive a required immunization because they think the child is already immune, either by having the disease or from a prior immunization? It will cause no harm to the child to receive a vaccine for a disease to which he/she is already immune. However, if a parent prefers that the child not receive additional immunizations, immunity may be proven as follows: FOR VARICELLA (\"chickenpox\") ONLY: If a parent reports that his/her child has already had chickenpox, varicella vaccine is not needed. A parental report of chickenpox should be documented in the facility record and the child's medical record. Children in a child care facility who have never been vaccinated against chickenpox or never had the disease will need the immunization. DISEASES OTHER THAN VARICELLA: A child must have either the required immunizations or must have laboratory-confirmed (usually this requires a blood test) immunity against a specific disease. PROCEDURE FOR CLAIMING LABORATORY-CONFIRMED IMMUNITY : (1) The child must receive appropriate laboratory testing ( i.e., antibody levels indicating immunity to the specific disease) verified by an Alaska-licensed medical doctor (mD), doctor of osteopathy (DO), advanced nurse practitioner (ANP), or physician assistant (PA). (Note: The State of Alaska does not provide free antibody testing except in the circumstances of an ongoing outbreak.) (2) An Alaska-licensed MD, DO, ANP, or PA must evaluate the laboratory result to determine if it indicates immunity. If the medical professional determines the result shows immunity to a disease, he/she should give the following to the child's parent/guardian: A copy of the laboratory report and A cover note stating the child does not need additional doses of the specified vaccine because the child is already immune to the disease in question. (3) The parent must submit both the laboratory report and the cover note to the child's school or child care facility to meet the immunization requirement. What if parents sign a religious exemption statement because the law does not allow for personal or philosophical exemptions? All religious exemptions must be documented on the \"Religious Exemption Form\" (sample, p. \u00188) or contain the exact exemption wording found in \u0018 AAC 06.055(b)(\u0018) or \u0018 AAC 6\u0018.\u001850(c)(\u0018) . The parent or guardian must sign the statement which states \"I/We affirm that immunization conflicts with the tenets and practices of the church or religious denomination of which the applicant is a member.\" A parent who signs such a statement based upon philosophical opposition to immunization is in violation of Alaska law. Does a religious exemption form have to be notarized? Alaska Immunization regulations \u0018 AAC 06.055(b)(\u0018) and \u0018 AAC 6\u0018.\u001850(c)(\u0018) state that immunization requirements do not apply if the child has \"an affidavit signed by his parent or guardian affirming that immunizations conflict with the tenets or practices of the church or religious denomination of which the applicant is a member.\" The state-recommended Religious Exemption Form (p. \u00188) provides the format for acknowledgment of the affidavit by a Notary Public. Exemptions that lack a notary's signature will not be classified as being \"out of compliance.\" School districts, private schools, and child care facilities should develop their own policies about whether they will accept religious exemptions that have not been signed by a notary public.Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third Edition Page \u0018\u0018VACCINES Why are children in a child care facility, preschool program, or Head Start program (i.e., prior to kindergarten entry) not required to have a Dt ap booster after they turn 4 years of age even though they are sometimes in a facility with children in grades kindergarten and higher who are required to have an additional dose after 4 years of age? The standard medical recommendation is for a child to receive a dose of DTaP at some point between 4-6 years of age. This dose boosts/strengthens immunity that was developed as the result of previously received doses. Although the medical recommendation is based upon an age range, the rEquIrEmENT is based only upon kindergarten entry (i.e., a grade rather than an age cohort) because operationally, this is often the most readily accessible time at which to check the child's record. Why should a child receive no more than 6 Dt ap immunizations (regardless of spacing) before 7 years of age? When administered too frequently, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (the \"DT\" portion of the vaccine) can produce increased rates of reactions in some persons. These reactions are thought to result from the formation of \"antigen-antibody complexes.\" If a child has received at least 6 doses of vaccine, it is likely at least some of the doses were given at sufficient intervals to be effective. Therefore, 6 doses are sufficient, and this limit reduces the chance of the occurrence of a vaccine reaction. Since a child needs at least 4 Dtp/Dt ap and at least one dose should be after the 4th birthday, should a parent just delay getting the 4th Dtp/Dt ap until after the child is 4 years of age? No. For adequate protection against diphtheria (D), tetanus (T), and pertussis (P), children should adhere to the recommended schedule and receive a full series of 4 DTP/DTaP before their 4th birthday. This is especially important because the impact of these diseases can be most damaging when a child is younger. Children 4 years of age must have four appropriately spaced doses of DTP/DTaP (unless they are in a \"waiting period\" before they may receive additional doses) to remain in compliance for admission into a licensed child care facility, certified preschool program, or head Start program. is a record indicating receipt of fractional (split) doses of Dt ap acceptable? No. While not a recommended procedure, some records may show the standard DTaP dose of 0.5 ml was cut in half. For immunization requirements, fractional doses that add up to 0.5 ml may NOT be counted as one dose. If this has occurred, the immunization must be repeated. Why is Hib vaccine not recommended for a child 5 years of age and older? recommendations for the age at which vaccines are administered are influenced by many factors, including the age-specific risks of disease and disease complications. hib disease is uncommon in persons 5 years of age and older. Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third Edition Page \u0018\u0018Are both IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine ) and OPV (oral poliovirus vaccine) acceptable for meeting the polio immunization requirement? Either vaccine may be counted toward meeting the polio immunization requirement. is there a minimum spacing requirement between doses of mmr and varicella if they are not given at the same time? For compliance, there is no minimum spacing required between these two vaccines. However, general medical recommendations advise a minimum spacing of \u00188 days between administration of MMR and varicella vaccine if not given at the same visit. If you have questions about possible discrepancies between compliance and medical recommendations, call the Alaska Immunization Program (\u001869-8000) for guidance. can mmr vaccine and/or varicella be given at the same time as ppD? Yes, if they are given on the same day. If they are not given on the same day: The mmr and/or varicella may be given at any time AFTEr the PPD. The PPD should be delayed until at least 4-6 weeks after the mmr and/or varicella. (MMR/varicella immunization may temporarily suppress the Tb skin test reactivity.) Is it acceptable for children to receive separate antigens (e.g., separate vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella) or must they receive combination vaccines such as \"mmr\"? It is acceptable for a child to receive protection against diseases through either individual antigens or equivalent combination vaccines, when they are available. However, combinations are preferred because using single antigens requires more doses be given over a longer period of time, greatly increasing the possibility that a child will remain unprotected. Combination vaccines such as mmr, DTaP, and DTaP- HepB-IPV are in general use throughout the United States. chi If a child lacks a single antigen (e.g., pertussis) from a vaccine that usually is given in combination with other antigens (e.g., Dt ap), what actions should be taken? Any child who does not have the required number of antigens should be referred to his/her medical provider. The child will need to obtain either (a) the needed antigen or (b) an exemption from the needed antigen. Why is rubella vaccine recommended but not required for children over 12 years of age? When the Alaska immunization laws were passed in \u0018977, it was not known if vaccinating women of child - bearing age with rubella posed a risk to the fetus, should a woman become pregnant. Evidence obtained since then has not substantiated this concern. However, current law provides authority only to strongly recommend children over age \u0018\u0018 receive rubella vaccine. Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third Edition Page \u0018\u0018Which vaccines are contraindicated for pregnant teens? Although there is no evidence that any \"live\" vaccine (i.e., measles, mumps, rubella, varicella) causes birth defects, the theoretical possibility exists. Therefore, live vaccines generally should not be given to pregnant females. however, \"inactivated\" vaccines such as tetanus/diphtheria (Td) present no problem to a pregnant woman or her fetus and may be safely administered during pregnancy. Females who are not adequately immunized and become pregnant should discuss immunization issues with their physician or other health care provider. If it is determined that vaccines are contraindicated, a valid medical exemption must be provided by a MD, DO, ANP or PA. SPACING Why is it important to check minimum spacing between vaccine doses? Although a consideration of spacing makes the analysis of a child's immunization record more complicated, it is critically important in determining if the child is adequately protected. The required spacing between vaccine doses is based on the body's ability to respond to the immunization. If this minimum spacing is not maintained, the body may be unable to build the proper antibody response and the child will not be protected. Therefore, when the Immunization Program conducts audits and determines children received immunizations at less than the minimum intervals, the immunization is not counted and must be repeated. Acceptable spacing between immunizations is shown on pp. 8 - \u0018\u0018. is a 4-day grace period allowed when counting minimal intervals between vaccine doses? No. A 4-day grace period will NOT be honored in determining compliance with Alaska immunization requirements (ref. Epidemiology Bulletin No. \u0018\u0018, June \u00187, \u001800\u0018). http://www.epi.hss.state.ak.us/bulletins/docs/b\u001800\u0018_\u0018\u0018.htm Why must vaccines be repeated if received before the minimum age or minimum interval between doses? Children who receive vaccines before the minimum recommended age or minimum interval between doses might not develop an adequate antibody response to the immunization. For example, a child temporarily retains antibodies from its mother against certain diseases, which can interfere with the effectiveness of some types of vaccines. Therefore, even though a child physically received a \"shot\", it may have been ineffective in protecting him/her against disease. If vaccines are given \u0018 or \u0018 days before the minimum required age or minimum interval, \"only \u0018 day early\" would easily slip to \"only early\" to \"only \u0018 or \u0018 weeks early\", etc., until a child would be unprotected. By consistently maintaining the minimum age requirement and minimum interval for all vaccines, children are assured of protection. Refer to charts on pp. 8 - \u0018\u0018 for minimum spacing requirements.Alaska School and Child Care Facility Immunization Manual Third Edition Page \u0018\u0018What is the appropriate timing/schedule if a vaccine dose must be repeated? Because it may have been ineffective, a dose is considered \"invalid\" if it is given before the minimum age or minimum interval from a prior dose. This invalid dose does not meet Alaska immunization requirements and must be repeated. Recent medical recommendations have noted that the timing for repeating the vaccine should be when at least a minimum interval has passed since the \"invalid\" dose. Therefore, for auditing purposes, the Alaska Immunization Program will count from the invalid dose when determining whether the compliance \"maximum\" has been surpassed. This allows providers the greatest amount of time to bring a child into compliance. If a child's immunization record indicates the dose was previously repeated and it was at least a minimum interval from the last valid or invalid dose, it will be considered compliant and will not be required to be repeated. How do I count days when considering immunization spacing? Count the date of birth or the date of the latest immunization as \"day 0\", the next day as \"day \u0018\", and continue sequentially from there. Do children need to repeat an entire vaccine series if their immunizations were not given according to the \"compliance\" schedules shown on pp. 8-13? NO. In general, any doses given after the minimum acceptable age and with proper spacing between doses may be counted toward completion of a vaccine series. It is not necessary to restart the series of any vaccine due to an extended interval between doses. For example, a child may have received dose #\u0018 of hepatitis B at birth and dose #\u0018 at 6 months of age, but never received dose #3. The minimum interval of one month required between the first two doses was met. Even though the child is now beyond the \"maximum\" period listed on the compliance charts (pp. 8 - 13), it is perfectly valid to receive dose #3 at this time to complete the series. mEDICALLY, there is no such thing as a maximum time period between doses; a vaccine series may be continued at any point in time without re-starting the entire series. For COMPLIANCE purposes, \"maximum\" is an operational term established to provide schools and child care facilities a cut-off point at which time they can determine they have waited \"long enough\", and now a child needs to be brought up to date. A vaccine given AFTEr this time period has expired is completely medically effective, however, and acceptable for compliance purposes. What should be done if the immunization record shows that vaccines were received at intervals (months or years) longer than those recommended. As noted in the previous question, all doses given at intervals longer than recommended should be counted, as this does not lessen the effectiveness of the vaccine. It is not necessary to repeat the series. What should be done if a child's record indicates a 3-dose series of hepatitis A? For compliance purposes , the Alaska Immunization Program will accept \u0018-\u0018 doses of any formulation of hepatitis A vaccine received after \u0018 year of age, as long as any \u0018 of the doses are separated by at least 6 months.
