Learn how to connect to your own good medicine and discover the powerful energy healing that will bring authentic wellness, health, hope, and joy into your life. Hilary Crowley is the resident energy healer at a general family medical center in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Working alongside surgeons, physicians, nurses, and holistic practitioners, she uses energy medicine modalities and hands-on techniques to facilitate her clients' healing. In this book, Hilary sheds light on questions surrounding energy medicine by sharing stories from cases including cancer battles, suicide attempts, and chronic pain. She shares how to find healing through the good medicines in your own cabinet: things like connection, grace, forgiveness, creativity, and more. In a healthcare system that has become increasingly focused on specialization and treating specific ailments or organs, the concepts of energy medicine and treating the whole patient are, unfortunately, often lost. Hilary aims to revolutionize the conversation about our body and spirit in the healthcare industry by speaking directly to patients and medical providers. Our bodies have the power to heal, and simply need guidance and awareness to access this vital energy for prevention and recovery. Through practical insights, inspiring stories, and thoughtful questions posed to the reader, this book is more than a guide to energy healing; it offers you the key to unlocking your good medicine cabinet and discovering holistic health and wellbeing.
