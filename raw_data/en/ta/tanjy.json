While the [Intelligent Medicine Starter Kit](https://drhoffman.com/intelligent-medicine-starter-kit/) provides a good foundation for health, those looking to safeguard their immune systems will benefit from additional focused supplementation. Over the years I have refined my list of top supplements offering the greatest boost for your immune system when it is most needed. My patients and listeners who have followed this regimen report remarkably few instances other than the mildest respiratory infections.

Xlear Nasal Spray: Airborne pathogens, particulates, and allergens enter our bodies through the nose and mouth where they are then absorbed, which can create an immune reaction which leads to a cold or flu. Xylitol in Xlear retards the formation of biofilms which perpetuate sinus problems. I recommend it to my patients during cold, flu, and allergy season. Transfer Factor (take one, twice daily), a colostrum-derived product that boosts the vigilance of white blood cells, and olive leaf extract (Olivir, take one, twice daily) that is rich in oleuropein, a potent natural antiviral The powerful combination of immune-enhancing herbal extracts in ViraCon (take two, twice daily) helps to increase cytokines and the production of other important immune factors. Aller-C (take two, 2-4 times daily) combines Isoquercitrin for superior bioavailability with vitamin C for immune support, citrus bioflavonoids to help maintain capillary stability, and bromelain for inflammatory support. Quercetin (take two, twice daily between meals) is a potent bioflavonoid that promotes healthy enzyme levels and supports normal sinus and respiratory function. It also helps support stable mast cells to promote inflammatory balance. NAC (take one, 1-2 times daily with food) supports healthy mucosal lining in sinus and respiratory systems, and proper lung function.
