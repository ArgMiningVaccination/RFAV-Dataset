Since ancient times, humans have used herbs and [supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm) to treat every conceivable illness. Even today, neither [influenza](https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm) nor coronavirus [vaccinations](https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm) are 100 percent effective, so your immune system can use all the help it can get. Let's look at some of the best antiviral herbs you can take to stay healthy. Many different herbs and [supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm) have been used as medicinal treatments for years. Some of the best antiviral herbs and supplements have even been used therapeutically to manage symptoms of coronavirus. NAC to astragalus 1. NAC Your body naturally produces the amino acid N-acetylcysteine (NAC). When this amino acid is metabolized, it becomes the powerful antioxidant glutathione. NAC can kill [viruses](https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) and reduce inflammation. It thins [mucus](https://www.medicinenet.com/treating_congestion/article.htm) in the [lungs](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm) of those with upper respiratory illnesses, and it's even attracted attention as a [COVID-19](https://www.medicinenet.com/wuhan_coronavirus_2019-ncov/article.htm) treatment. A study found that NAC treatment stopped the [SARS](https://www.medicinenet.com/severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars/article.htm)-CoV-2 (COVID) virus from spreading. NAC may inhibit the \" [cytokine storm](https://www.medicinenet.com/cytokine_storm_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)\" caused by hyper-inflammation. This \"storm\" can cause significant tissue and organ failure, possibly resulting in death. Another study discovered that NAC suppressed replication of the human [flu](https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm) A virus. As part of a study, NAC was given to [breast cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_facts_stages/article.htm) patients for two to three weeks. NAC decreased quantities of MCT4, a \"transporter\" cell that transfers energy from neighboring cells to [cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm) cells.
