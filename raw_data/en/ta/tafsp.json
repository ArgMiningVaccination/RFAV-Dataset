Talks from the years between 2001, when ST&B's webcasts begin, and 2009 are notable for ranging over a wide range of subjects, from animal emotions to the parking garage, community gardens to the fate of the Mayans. Speakers included the curator of the National Herb Garden, NASA astrobiologists and physicists, the Director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at NIH, and the founder of Kinko's. Highlights include Jane Gooddall on endangered animals (2009), Judith Jones on her book The Tenth Muse (2007), Bob Ryan on being a meteorologist (2006), and Paul Krugman on The Great Unraveling (2004). Jane Goodall--primatologist, conservationist and humanitarian, whose work with wild chimpanzees in Gombe, Tanzania, is known throughout the world--talks about these inspiring success stories and the efforts of dedicated environmentalists. Judith Jones, vice president and senior editor at Alfred A. Knopf, was the winner of the coveted James Beard Lifetime Achievement Award and editor of culinary luminaries such as Julia Child, James Beard, Madhur Jaffrey, Marcella Hazan, Edna Lewis and Joan Nathan. Bob Ryan, chief meteorologist at NBC4 (WRC-TV), discussed weather forecasting. Eric Grissell, entomologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, gives a lecture and slide show on his book, \"Insects and Gardens: In Pursuit of a Garden Ecology.\" Grissell suggests it might be time to declare a truce with insects in the garden.
