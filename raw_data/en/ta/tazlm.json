Since then, his research has been mainly devoted to developing stochastic models and statistical methods related to the analysis of infectious diseases data. Over the past 30+ years, his research has focused on estimating parameters related to the direct, indirect and overall effects of vaccines and vaccination programs. These methods have been applied to data from observational studies and clinical trials on influenza, pneumococcal, rotavirus and other infectious diseases. Dr. Haber was the principal investigator on four NIH R01 grants and on numerous other grants and contracts. He published over 130 peer-reviewed papers and a few book chapters. Dr. Haber taught courses in probability theory, statistical inference, and on analysis of categorical, survival and infectious diseases data. He directed numerous PhD dissertations and master's theses.
