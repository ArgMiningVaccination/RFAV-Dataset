Quinoa pancakes Makes 8 120g Quinoa flakes 2 medium eggs 1/2 tsp gluten-free baking powder 120ml of milk or milk alternative Coconut oil Read more Place all the ingredients except the coconut oil in a tall jug and process with a hand blender until a thick mixture of dropping consistency develops. Warm a small amount (about 1/2 a tsp) of coconut oil in a heavy bottomed frying pan over a medium heat. Carefully drop spoonfuls of the mixture into the hot pan to form individual pancakes about 8cm across. This amount of mixture will make 8 pancakes so you will probably need to cook them in 2-3 batches. Remember to add a small amount of coconut oil to the pan between batches to prevent sticking. As the pancakes cook, bubbles will rise to the surface. Once golden on the underside (about 4-5 minutes) turn over using a fish slice and cook for a further 1-2 minutes. Keep the pancakes warm in a low heat oven until you are ready to serve. Great served with blueberries, honey cinnamon and cashew nut cream as a dessert or delicious breakfast! This recipe is from CNM lecturer Holly Taylor Lemon Balm: The Perfect Herb for Exam Nerves Lemon Balm acts on a part of the brain called the GABA system to cause mild sedation. However, at the same time it increases acetylcholine in the brain, a chemical which results in relaxed alertness and improved memory function, thus creating a perfect mental state for exams. Read more Recommended dosage: - Herbal Tea: 1 teaspoon of dried lemon balm per cup or 1.5 tablespoons of fresh lemon balm per cup - Ready-made tincture: 1 in 5 strength 2-6 mls three times a day - There are a number of proprietary capsules and tablets also available in reputable stores, but choose whole herbs in preference, for a balanced medicinal effect. Everyone is different and you should try it out before the exams to see what your own optimal dose is within the dose ranges given above. Lemon Balm's positive effect on memory has been highly regarded for hundreds of years and now modern science has confirmed the mechanism for these effects, making it a perfect herb for exam nerves. Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis) is a member of the mint family and contains a range of volatile oils and acids which are responsible for its medicinal effects, including anti-viral and anti-inflammatory effects. You can grow this hardy perennial in a large pot outdoors. Pick the leaves in the afternoon before flowering when the oils are at their highest. Steep the leaves in hot but not boiling water for 4-5 minutes and make sure you cover the tea to prevent the oils escaping. Remember to pick enough leaves for drying before it is in full bloom in late spring/early summer. The dried herb will keep in a dark airtight container for up to one year. CAUTION If you have thyroid disease or are taking medication, do not take Lemon Balm except under specialist supervision from a professional Natural Health Practitioner.

Luckily, Chinese Medicine has a simple solution. One of the most useful Acupuncture points for the treatment of hay fever symptoms can be safely and effectively used with acupressure. The point 'Large Intestine 21 is called 'Welcome Fragrance', and it benefits the nose and treats nasal problems of all kinds. As well as hay fever it can be used for nasal congestion, runny nose, sinusitis, rhinitis, sneezing and so on. It is useful whether the problem is acute or chronic. Read more The point is easily located on either side of the nostrils, in the naso-labial groove (the lines that run from the nostrils down to the corners of the mouth.) To use this point apply firm pressure with your fingertips for a minute or two, or until the point feels slightly sore or you feel a sensation of warmth or tingling. If you like, you can also apply small circular rotations instead of direct pressure - do whatever feels best. Blocked noses can sometimes clear instantly using this point! This point is often used by acupuncturists when dealing with hay fever, but an acupuncturist will also be able to work on the underlying causes as well as tailor a plan to address your particular symptoms. If you suffer badly with hay fever or rhinitis, it is well worth looking up a good acupuncturist for some advice! See your health professional for personalised advice. This tip comes to you from Neil Kingham ( [www.qi-therapies.com](http://www.qi-therapies.com/)), a Chinese Medicine practitioner and CNM lecturer. He works with acupuncture, massage, and nutrition, and is based in Bristol and Portishead. Homeopathy for mild sunstroke Sunstroke, or heatstroke (not to be confused with sunburn), is an illness caused by lasting exposure to very hot temperatures or dehydration. It can also be triggered if the body's own temperature regulation mechanisms fail to work properly. Read more Just a rise of a couple of degrees in the body's regular temperature can have extreme effects on the way the metabolism works, manifesting itself as dizziness, fatigue, a headache, rapid pulse, rapid breathing, and muscle cramps, and the body cannot cool itself. The effects can damage organs, so seek urgent medical attention if symptoms are severe. Avoid getting sunstroke by not over-exerting yourself in very hot temperatures, seeking the shade, wearing a hat, and drinking plenty of clean water. For mild symptoms, take measures to reduce your temperature at once, such as lie in the cool with legs raised, take a cool bath, and sip cool water. Homeopath Rebecca Johnson who has been practicing for 7 years, says that many people find the Homeopathic remedy Belladonna 30c, to be a fantastic aid to addressing the symptoms of mild sunstroke. Or, if the symptoms seem worse with movement and there is great thirst, then Bryonia 30c is more appropriate. Homeopathic preparations, usually in pill format, are widely available in health stores across the UK. Make sure that you buy the recommended potency (in this case 30c). They are delicate and need careful handling. Follow the advice on the pack. Whilst taking them, avoid coffee, mint, camphor, menthol and eucalyptus. Enjoy your holidays! Always seek personal advice from your health professional.

The antioxidants contained in Elderberry help stimulate the immune system and its powerful anti-inflammatory properties can help reduce aches, pains and fever. Read more Do not eat it raw or it could be toxic. Where appropriate, I supply an Elderberry Tincture to my patients (\u00a36 for a 50ml bottle plus p&p), and advise them to take 15-20 drops four times a day in a little water for five days as soon as they feel the symptoms of flu coming on, to help reduce the symptoms and speed recovery time. Elderberry can also be taken preventatively at a lesser dose (15 drops twice daily). Always consult with a qualified herbalist for specific advice before taking herbal medicines.

By Gemma Hurditch Naturopath & Director of Nutrition at CNM Natural holiday health & first-aid Some top tips to naturally help with common holiday ailments. Travellers' Tummy, Travel Sickness, Sunburn, Stings. Avoid travellers' tummy by topping up your good bacteria with a probiotic for two to four weeks before you travel and then continue while on holiday. Read more Ginger is an absolute must in the battle against travel sickness.. Grate half an inch of ginger with a teaspoon of honey into a mug of boiling water and sip when cool. If you have a history of travel sickness, try taking a zinc supplement for a week before you travel. If travelling by air, then manuka honey lozenges can help to prevent 'ear-pop' on take-off and landing. They also create a barrier to germs circulating on flights and calm and soothe dry mouth and throats in air- conditioned environments. Try to avoid getting sunburned, but if you do, then try a tepid bath with three to four chamomile teabags for mild cases. Try applying aloe vera gel two to three times a day as it has proven pain relief and anti-inflammatory properties and is extremely effective at calming the skin. Get immediate medical help if you feel very nauseous, dizzy or start vomiting. Beach or pavement cafes are prime sites for wasp and bee stings. For wasp stings, mix a teaspoon ofsalt with a few drops of vinegar for instant relief. For bee stings, remove the stinger carefully with tweezers, cut a raw onion in half, hold it to the sting for up to 15 minutes - this should provide immediate relief and help with the swelling. To keep other bugs at bay use a repellent with acitronella or tea-tree base. See your natural health professional for any health related questions.
