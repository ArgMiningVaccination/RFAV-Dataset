The plants themselves will be celebrated, with some discussion of their effects on mind and body. We will move gently through the mood spectrum: citrus for invigoration, rose and geranium for self-love and nurture, finishing with lavender for relaxation; meditating on each in turn. Essential oils will play a part through self-anointing (applying on pulse points) and diffusion. For meditation: although it is a generally safe and enjoyable practice, we ask that you check with your GP concerning any mental health conditions before booking. Further instructions will be sent to ticket holders in advance. Oxford Botanic Garden - 5 June "}
