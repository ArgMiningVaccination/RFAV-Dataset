By [Christina Marino](/experts/christinamarino) \u2014 Written on Nov 26, 2014 Functional medicine is a form of alternative medicine that is based on the essentials of Chinese medicine, modern western concepts and highly advanced medical and scientific research. Practitioners of Functional medicine study and explore the effects of environment agents, [lifestyle](/super-tag/lifestyle) choices, dietary habits and physical factors on the gastrointestinal, immune, and cardiovascular systems of the body in order to prevent and treat [health](/taxonomy/term/33369) issues. How is Functional Medicine different from conventional medicine? Functional medicine aims at identifying the factors that can contribute to a health issue instead of traditional medicine that primarily deals with treating the symptoms (or masking the effects of underlying disease process). Functional medicine utilizes the fundamental approaches in the identification and screening of risk factors that may lead to diseases (long before the symptoms of illness become evident). People who adopt functional medicine tends to live a longer, healthier and happier life filled with [ love](https://www.yourtango.com/love-dating-how-to-love-yourself-find-the-one-online-dating-confidence-video). Due to in-depth and system-oriented approach, both practitioner and patient enjoys a more healthy and positive therapeutic partnership as opposed to traditional medicine. The practitioners tend to spend time with their patients, paying attention to their case histories and discussing the factors that can influence pathogenesis of complex and chronic diseases. According to several research scientists, concepts of functional medicine are geared more towards the health care needs of 21st century. Functional medicine targets the whole individual rather than focusing on just symptoms. For example; meet Karen, Kim and Patrick who shares a common complaint\u2014heartburn or dyspepsia. The intensity of discomfort is moderate to severe and is interfering with their personal, social and professional aspects of life. \u2014Karen is a stock broker who works around the clock. A lot of times she doesn't even get time to take a proper lunch break. \u2014Kim is a thin, lean and attractive woman in her 30s. She is a yoga instructor who just loves coffee (needless to say she needs a lot of it to remain functional throughout her tiring schedule). \u2014Patrick on the other hand is a stay-home dad who spends most of his day in front of the television or computer. He writes for a marketing company and has recently adopted smoking. Imagine if three individuals visit a healthcare professional for the management of heartburn, it is very likely that all three patients will receive an antacid to suppress the disabling symptoms of heartburn and to maintain the quality of life. But is this the right course of action? It is very likely that these individuals are experiencing the symptoms due to their lifestyle choices, dietary or genetic factors. Every individual is different and therefore should be treated differently (according to the nature of illness and pathogenesis of the symptoms). It is quite possible that practitioner of functional medicine approach the symptom of these patients differently. He may advise Patrick to quit/ control smoking, Kim to control her caffeine intake and Karen to modify her lifestyle to have ample time for rest, relaxation and regular nutritious meals. It is sufficient to say that functional medicine has successfully transformed the focus of medical practice from disease-centered to patient-centered approach. Why do we need Functional Medicine? Due to several epidemiological, behavioral and environmental changes, today the need of a more schematic and preventive medical approach has become overwhelming. A few of these factors are: Related Stories From YourTango: - A rising prevalence and incidence of complex and chronic diseases like diabetes, cancer, mental illness, auto-immune disorders like arthritis etc. - Most of the physicians follow acute system of care.
