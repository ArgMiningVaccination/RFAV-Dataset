All students are expected to seek help, support, guidance from their faculty, instructors and supervisors when necessary. Students are expected to attend their classes and clinical placements. Attendance Policy for classes will be listed in each course syllabus. Any excessive absences (in didactic and clinical classes) will delay a student's completion of th e graduate program. All students are required to meet with their faculty advisor prior to registration for the following semester to review KASA outcomes and coursework and progress toward graduation. Students are also required to meet with the Director of Clinical Education once a semester to review their clinical outcomes, clinical experience to date, discuss future clinical placement, and progress toward graduation. 4 All students are expected to attend and participate in all scheduled classes, clinical sessions, dates, and meetings as deemed necessary and appropriate by the professors or supervisors. Attendance is mandatory. Students cannot miss more than one didactic class per semester without penalty (unless they are attending their clinical experience i n Clinical I or Clinical II, their grade is not affected) , otherwise their grade will be affected. If a student is absent more than three didactic classes in a course during a semester, a student will be recommended for a leave of absence, INC, or Failing grade in the course , depending on the circumstances. For additional information about a course attendance policy refer to the course syllabus. Students are expected to attend their clinical placement the amount of days/times agreed upon (with the site supe rvisor and the DCE ) for the entire semester. A student cannot modify or reduce their schedule witho ut discussion with the DCE and site s upervisor. If a student is absent from their site, they must make up the days/times at the site. The clinical dates, times, and sessions to participate are determined by either the DCE and/or the site supervisor based on caseload, clinical schedule, and didactic course schedule. The student is to arrive on time to the site and active participation in miscellaneous tasks may be required (documentation, billing, meetings) beyond the end time of the clinical day. If a student is absent 7 or more days from their site, they will earn a failing grade and must repeat the clinical (the following year). Two latenesses equates with on e absence for their clinical site. 1.5 Director of Clinical Education Responsibilities The Director of Clinical Education will serve as the program's liaison between the program and the Clinical experience s. This person is the primary contact between the site supervisor/instructor and the program.

The process of validating student learning outcomes for the knowledge and skills required for entry into professional practice will consist of a variety of formative and summative assessments such as: course exams, student self -evaluation of student learning outcomes; instructor evaluation of student learning outcomes; semester meetings with advisor to track progress towards completion of CFCC requirements and graduation requirement s; mid -term and end of semester clinic evaluations, pass rate on the Praxis examination in SLP; student program clinical portfolios; and solicited feedback from employers, advisory committee, external supervisors, and alumni; as well as professional involv ement and expertise of the program faculty and ensuing discussions at faculty meetings and at the annual retreat. The student will be expected to meet the knowledge and skills competencies for each course. The instructor for the course will provide the st udent with the knowledge and skills outcomes for the course. The student will review the knowledge and skill areas at the midterm and final examination timeframes. If the student does not meet the knowledge and skills in an assignment/course, the student i s expected to complete an \"remediation\" assignment. This assignment is designed in collaboration with the instructor. After the student achieves the knowledge and skills necessary for the assignment/course, the grade does not change. The program will use a variety of mechanisms to provide and document regular feedback to students regarding their progress in achieving the expected knowledge and skills in all academic and clinical components of the program. For the academic program: Instructors will provide students with formative mid -semester and final evaluations of student learning outcomes as part of each course and within each clinic experience (HHS 581: Clinical I, HHS 582: Clinical II, HHS 583: Clinical III, HHS 584: Clinical IV and HHS 585: Clinical V, Clinical in the Schools). In addition, students will have semester meetings with their assigned advisor. During these meetings, the student and advisor will review the following forms: Evaluation of Student Learning Outcomes for each course; Student Se lf-Evaluation of Student Lea rning Outcomes for each course, Generic Skills Inventory form , and Clinical Self -Evaluation form completed by the student, as well as the student's program portfolio. Students are expected to complete a site evaluation/superviso r evaluation after each clinical in CALIPSO. Student learning outcomes and the clinical evaluations forms will be aligned with the knowledge and skills delineated in the KASA. During the review of the aforementioned forms, the student and advisor will discuss and document the student's current knowledge and skills on the KASA. During this meeting the advisor and student will also update the student's Planned Course of Study form which includes ASHA CCC requirements, program degree requirements, state lic ensure requirements, state teacher certification requirements, and/or other program certifications. At this time the Planned Course of Study form is also updated and signed and dated by the advisor and student, as well as the Semester Clock Hour form. The original of these forms will be placed in the student's file and the student will be provided with a copy of 27 the forms to retain in their program portfolio. Other mechanisms that will be used to provide and document regular feedback to students regardin g their progress in achieving the expected knowledge and skills in the clinical components of the program include: o weekly meetings with their clinic supervisors; o written feedback following clinic sessions or portions of clinic sessions that the clinic su pervisor observed, mid-term and end of the semester meetings where the clinic supervisor and student review the Clinical Self -Evaluation form completed by the student clinician in conjunction with Student Clinician Evaluation form completed by the supervis or. 3.2 Policies for Intervention and Remediation and Probation Students are expected to complete their KASA form after the completion of each course where they met the learning outcomes. The instructor will complete Evaluation of Student Learning Outcomes Fo rm and return it to the student. If the student requires a Remediation plan, the Remediation form will be used. Students will be placed on Probation for demonstrating any violation of the ASHA Code of Ethics or unprofessional behaviors in the program, as w ell as obtaining one C+ or lower in a didactic course or a B - or lower in a clinical course. Students will be removed from probation after a full semester of grades higher than B - in didactic courses and B in clinical courses. Dismissal from the program If a student earns two failing grades in didactic and/or clinical classes, the student is dismissed from the program. Maximum Time to Degree A student can take up to 5 years to complete Track I, II or III of the program. After five years, the student will b e dismissed from the program Leave of Absence A student may request or require a Leave of Absence which has to be approved by the chair and the Dean's office. A Leave of Absence can be taken for up to one year. If a student does not return to the program a fter one year, the student will be dismissed from the program. 3.3 Academic aspects of the program: A student will be expected to successfully attain all the knowledge and skills/competencies for each of the didactic and clinical courses. Students must earn a grade of \"B - \"or higher in all didactic courses and demonstrate mastery of the required knowledge and skills for that subject ar ea. If students earn a C+ grade or lower or does not master the required knowledge and skills for that subject area, they must c omplete an assignment to acquire the knowledge and skills which they did not achieve in the course. The faculty instructor in collaboration with the chair of the program and the student will develop a remediation plan for the student to achieve the knowled ge and skills. If a student earns a second grade of C+ or lower in didactic courses, they will be dismissed from the program. If a student receives a grade of B - or higher but does not demonstrate mastery of all the Knowledge and Skills, the faculty instru ctor in collaboration with the chair of the program and the student will develop a remediation plan for the student to achieve the knowledge and skills. If a student earns a grade of an F in any course, they are dismissed from the program. 3.4 Clinical aspect s of the program: A student will be expected to successfully attain all the knowledge and skills/competencies for each of the clinical courses. Students must earn a grade of \"B \"or higher in all clinical course and demonstrate mastery of the required knowl edge and skills for that subject area. If students earn a B - grade or lower in any clinical or does not master the 28 required knowledge and skills for that subject area (midterm or final performance evaluation), the student must complete a remediation plan to acquire the knowledge and skills and earn the clinical clock hours from the failed clinical. The Director of Clinical Education and the clinical supervisor in collaboration with the Chair of the program and the student will develop a Remediation plan for the student to achieve the knowledge and skills. Also, the student will then have to repeat the clinical course when it is offered again and may not be enrolled in a clinical course the following semester. If a student earns a second grade of B - or lower in a clinical course, the student will be dismissed from the program. If a student receives a grade of B or higher but does not demonstrate mastery of all the Knowledge and Skills, the clinical supervisor in collaboration with the director of clinical edu cation and the program chair will develop a remediation plan for the student to achieve the knowledge and skills. The faculty instructor will ensure that the remediation plan designed will be implemented, documented and provided to students. After the stud ent completes the remediation plan and achieves the desired competencies, the faculty advisor documents this within the student's file. The chair will ensure that these policies and procedures will be applied consistently across all students who are identi fied as needing intervention. All remediation plans will be submitted to the chair who will review and sign off on the plans once the faculty instructor has approved it. All the faculty will review the plans yearly during the faculty retreat to ensure that the plans are consistent in rigor and expectations. 3.5 Summative Assessments of the Program The program will use midterm and final course evaluation, evaluations from clinical sites, supervisor evaluations, student program completion rates in the three tra cks, PRAXIS scores, and employment rates, and exit and alumni surveys to evaluate program quality. The chair will discuss instructors' syllabi, midterm and final course evaluations with them to determine what possible changes are necessary to ensure that c ourse content is of appropriate quality, currency and effectiveness. The program will evaluate the currency and effectiveness of all aspects of the program in faculty meetings, annual retreat and meetings with advisory committee. The chair and the faculty will review the student graduate rates, PRAXIS scores, and employment rates at program meetings and the annual retreat to determine if any modifications are necessary in the program. The program will engage in a systematic self -study at an annual faculty r etreat. The faculty and chair will review the mission and goals of the program, curriculum, formative and summative assessment measures, and program outcome data to note if any modifications in the program are required. Students are required to complete two summative assessment measures prior to being eligible for graduation: 1. A Capstone Research Project which is the summative measure for the program. Students are required to complete a project in the second year of their graduate program. This course will provide the students the necessary tools to prepare and present a professional poster illustrating their research study. Students will write a research paper summarizing their capstone project for submission to a journal or for a professional presentation . A year -long Capstone Research Project is one of the summative measures for the Stony Brook University Graduate program in Speech Language Pathology. Students begin their capstone experience when they enroll in HHS 551 Research Methods and Resources in Co mmunication Sciences and Disorders during the spring of their first year. Students conclude their Capstone experience in HHS 594 Capstone Project in Speech Language Pathology and Praxis Examination Preparation in the spring of their second year. During HHS 551, students are expected to complete the following: Students will complete an on -line Human Subjects training in the course. Link to be provided. Students will create a group of 5 students who they will work with to develop and complete the research project. A research mentor will be assigned to each student group by the summer. A meeting will be scheduled with the mentor where the group of students will propose (five students) potential topics for research project. Students will arrange a schedule to m eet with their mentor during the semester. Each member of the group will have designated roles/responsibilities. One group member will be the 29 facilitator for the group. This student will be responsible for setting up the zoom invites, creating a folder in google drive including but not limited to the meeting minutes, literature, the timeline for the study, IRB proposal, letters of permission, copy of survey or other instrumentation, if applicable Students are expected to meet with their group separate from meeting with their mentor during the spring and fall semesters. Mentor meetings will occur approximately every 2 weeks in the spring and the following fall semesters. Each student group will submit a literature review, research question and method for rev iew, in addition to an IRB application by the end of the spring semester. Students are encouraged to use information from the library presentation that was held during the first semester and/or contact the librarian for information related to conducting li terature review and referencing with Endnote as well as using APA format (7th edition). Each student will find and select a minimum of 6 research articles on the topic of choice. It is recommended that students use a shared document as to avoid repetition of articles. The group will then work together to prepare a 5 - 8-page literature review. This document synthesizes all the papers read by the students in a research group into one cogent review, culminating in the purpose, rationale, research questions(s) , and hypotheses. Each student group prepares a Method section. Each student group submits an IRB application by the end of HHS 551. During the fall prior to HHS 594, students are expected to: Test their research hypotheses/carry out their research study. Meet with their mentor every 2 -3 weeks as well as meet with their group separate from their mentor. During HHS 594, in the spring, students are expected to: This course will provide the students the necessary tools to prepare and present a professional po ster illustrating their research study. Students are required to write a paper summarizing their capstone project for submission to a journal or an abstract for a professional presentation to an association, for example, ASHA, NYSSLHA, or another organizat ion. Additionally, each student group should submit an abstract of 200 words to their mentor and capstone instructor 2 months prior to the presentation date. Create a professional poster with literature, research question/hypotheses, methodology (participa nts, materials and procedures), results (statistical analysis, tables and figures), discussion (clinical implications, limitations, and future research). The students will present their posters to the department and School of Health Sciences. Each member o f the group should be prepared to present part of their presentation. Each student group should prepare a handout which should be submitted for approval to their mentor and capstone instructor one month prior to the presentation. The rubrics for this summa tive assessment are in the appendices. 2. An e-Clinical Portfolio which is a summative assessment for the clinical component of the program. Students are expected to organize clinical evidence in a binder, including, Midterm and Final Evaluations for a ll Clinicals, Research Training Certification (RCR and Human Participants Training), Capstone Project Paper, Evidence - Based Practice Presentation s, Resume, Diagnostic Evaluation, and one written sample from each clinical. Each semester during the student's advisement session, the student will bring his/her/they portfolio for the advisor to review. During the student's last semester, prior to graduation, the advisor will review the student's portfolio to ensure that all the clinical evidence is pres ent. The chair will review and sign off that he/she/they reviewed the student's clinical portfolio. Students will use a software program such as digication (not google drive or one drive) to create their clinical portfolios -- https://stonybrook.digication.com/app/ 30 Chapter 4 - Graduation Requirements 4.1 Graduation Requirements 1.

Examples of identifying information includes name, social security number, address, email, employer/school, etc. Students should not discuss clients/patients by name with anyone besides their clinical supervisor/instructor and the Director of C linical Education. This includes conversations on texts, emails, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, blogs, etc. Students cannot take pictures of clients/patients. Students are encouraged to discuss their clients/patients and clinical issues with fellow students and professors in courses, behind closed doors. Violations of client/patient confidentiality are very serious and can lead to dismissal from the program. Students are expected to complete an annual HIPAA Training. 5.8 FERPA Refer to the following link for information - https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/registrar/policies/ferpa.php. All faculty, staff and students will complete a FERPA training during the program . 5.9 Health Clea rance for Students All students must complete the Health Clearance form annually and other health related items, and a background check in Castlebranch by the beginning of their first semester. Students will have opportunities to observe and interact with clients/patients during their first clinical. Students are also required to update the form if any changes occur. Students should refer to the school's policy and will be using Castlebranch to upload this information. If a student is not cleared in Castl ebranch, this will delay their clinical start date and their grade in any of the clinical courses. 5.10 Policy for maintaining confidentiality Students are expected to maintain confidentiality in oral and written communication, as well as, report writing, wi th their site supervisors. Students are expected to follow policies and procedures for confidentiality in report writing as designated by their placement site. Students will have both stony brook.edu and stony brook medicine.edu email accounts. While stude nts are enrolled in Clinicals I and II, Audiology Clinical and Diagnostic Clinical, they will be sending correspondences, as well as, reports about clients/patients without any PHI information (name, address, etc...) using their stonybrookmedicine.edu (secur e server) account to their site supervisor. 1.Students who choose to be placed at a facility that requires a criminal history record check may object to completing the process. Such students may select, but shall not be guaranteed acceptance to an alternate clinical site, and may not be able to complete program requirements needed for graduation. 2.Criminal history screening includes a review of criminal convictions and probation. The following factors will be considered for individuals with criminal history: The n ature of the crime and its relationship to the position The amount of time elapsed since the occurrence The number of convictions The age of the person at the time of occurrence Whether accepting the individual for clinical instruction would pose an unreas onable risk to the facility, its employees or its patients Any information produced by the person regarding their rehabilitation and good conduct 3.Students may provide consent for criminal background checks through the CastleBranch portal. 4.CastleBranch wil l analyze the criminal history report and determine if a student has a criminal conviction. CastleBranch will notify the respective Health Sciences School representative for any student with a criminal conviction. 5.The School representative will initiate a meeting with the Criminal Background Clearance Committee 5.11 Castlebranch and Policy for student criminal background checks and drug screening Stony Brook University Health Sciences Schools are dedicated to preparing students in a variety of careers in medical facilities , social services organizations, and other institutions. The Health Sciences Schools require that all students participating in internships, practicums, clinical rotations, or otherwise working at Stony Brook Medicine facilities or other clinical training sites comply with the placement requirements of each respective clinical facility. Clinical sites increasingly request students to complete criminal background checks and drug screening to meet the requirements for placement. To facilitate placement at a clinical facility, the Health Sciences Schools will collaborate with CastleBranch, Inc. to help students obtain criminal background checks . CastleBranch is a vendor that specializes in higher education screening. Take a moment to review the C astlebranch presentation: https://healthprofessions.stonybrookmedicine.edu/sites/default/files/CastleBranch%20Presentation. pdf Students will set up student -pay accounts with CastleBranch to complete criminal background checks and drug screening that are required by clinical sites. Students will be responsible for paying CastleBranch directly and entering into an End User Agreement to gove rn their use of the system. Stony Brook University will not process payments. The Health Sciences Schools will certify students' eligibility for clinical placements based on the results of CastleBranch's criminal background checks and drug screening. CRIM INAL BACKGROUND CHECKS (Hereinafter referred to as \"Committee\"). 6. The Committee shall consult with the Office of General Counsel to review the student's criminal history and determine their eligibility for placement at the designa ted clinical site. 3435 35 DRUG TESTING 8. Students who choose to be placed at a facility that requires drug testing may decide not to consent to the screening. Such students may select, but are not guaranteed acceptance to an alternate clinical site, and m ay not be able to complete program requirements needed for graduation. 9. Students may provide consent for Drug Screening through the CastleBranch portal. 10. CastleBranch will analyze the toxicology report and determine if a student is eligible for placement at a clinical site. 11. The Health Sciences Schools will use CastleBranch's determination to certify that a student is eligible for placement. The drug testing services include a Medical Review Officer that will contact any student with a \"non - negative\" test to determine if there is an explanation (prescription, etc.). If a student has a New York State Medical Marijuana Card, the prescription will be verified by Stony Brook Medicine. 12. Upon request, subject to applicable confidentiality laws and Stony Brook Univer sity policy, the Health Sciences Schools will provide a written statement to indicate a student has completed drug screening and is eligible for placement. 13. The State of New York defines professional misconduct under New York State Education Law \u00a76530. Prof essional misconduct includes impairment resulting from being a habitual abuser of alcohol or drugs that impair a practitioner's judgment and performance (New York State Education Law \u00a7\u00a76530(7) and (8)). Professional misconduct also results from \"...being convicted of committing an act constituting a crime under New York State Law, or federal law or of the law of another jurisdiction ... which, if committed under the laws of the State of New York, would have been a crime under New York State law\" (New York State Education Law \u00a76530(9)). 14. Students who receive adverse results for toxicology screens and/or criminal background checks may be barred from clinical placements. This will impede a student's ability to complete a degree and/or obtain licensure in the student 's chosen field. Eligibility for licensure may depend upon work experience, completion of didactic and clinical education, not having a criminal record, and being free of illegal drugs and/or habitual alcohol abuse. Students are responsible for understandi ng the requirements of certification exams and licensure that are subject to change depending on the applicable certifying boards or agencies. 15. Generally, clinical sites will decline a student's application for a clinical placement if the student has had a positive toxicology screen and/or a record of criminal convictions nexus to the nature and scope of work at the facility. These determinations are fact and site-specific and may depend on the laws of the jurisdiction in which the site is located. The Unive rsity will not recommend students for clinical placement without the appropriate clearances. If a student is found to be ineligible due to the results of a toxicology report or criminal background check, the University will withdraw its recommendation rega rding the student's placement at the clinical site. If the adverse result(s) are discovered while the student is placed at the clinical site, the University will notify the clinical site and will remove the student from their placement. 16. The Office of Stude nt Affairs will: (1) offer resources to the student through the University's Counseling and Psychological Services (\"CAPS\") and the Center for Prevention and Outreach (\"CPO\") to assist the student, and/or (2) offer a meeting with University's Student Suppo rt Team in the Division of Student Affairs to provide resources and guidance. The student may also be offered participation in educational workshops/classes, such as the University's Substance Education course, to support healthy decision -making. Students are strongly recommended to avail themselves of all of the resources offered. Students enrolled in some non-matriculated programs may be ineligible to participate in CAPS or CPO resources but are encouraged to seek assistance through their faculty advisor. 7. Upon request, subject to applicable confidentiality laws and Stony Brook University policy, the respective Health Sciences School will submit a written statement to the clinical placement site that the criminal background check was conducted and that the student is eligible for placement. Ineligible students shall not be assigned to a clinical placement site. 36 The OIG is permitted to exclude individuals for the following conduct: Misdemeanor convictions related to health care fraud not involving federal or state funded programs, Misdemeanor convictions related to unlawful manufacturing, distributi on, prescription or dispensing of controlled substances, Conviction relating to obstruction of an investigation or audit, Suspension, revocation or surrender of a license to provide health care for reasons bearing on professional competence or performance or financial integrity, Provision of unnecessary or substandard services, Engaging in unlawful kickback arrangements, or Defaulting on a health education loan or scholarship obligations. 17.A student with a positive toxicology screen will be prohibited from participating in cli nical placements. As a result, the student may be unable to meet course objectives for classroom or clinical requirements. This may also affect eligibility for graduation and licensure. Students should consult their bulletins or their academic advisor regarding any academic consequences. 18.The Director of Health Sciences Schools Compliance shall consult with General Counsel, the Chief Compliance Officer, and the Senior Vice President for Health Sciences before a clinical placement affiliated is notified that a student is ineligible for placement due to toxicology or criminal background check results. 19.Students are to immediately disclose any convictions to their Program Directors. The respective School shall initiate a Committee meeting to review any student convictions. 20.The Health Sciences Schools shall maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect student information. STUDENT EXCLUSION SCREENING Stony Brook Medicine facilities, and other organizations affiliated with Stony Brook University Health Sciences Schools as clinical training sites may face civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal or state health care programs, including Medicai d and Medicare if students assigned to those sites are ineligible to participate in such programs. Therefore, all Health Sciences students shall be screened to identify persons who have been determined to be ineligible. Students shall immediately disclose any debarment, exclusion, suspension, or other event which make them ineligible to participate in federal or state health care programs. Students shall immediately report such events to their Program Directors and the Office of Health Sciences Schools Com pliance. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) is required to exclude individuals for the following conduct: Medicare or Medicaid fraud, Other healthcare fraud, theft or financial misconduct, Patient abuse or neglect, Felony convictions related to health care fraud, or Felony convictions related to unlawful manufacturing, distribution, prescription, or dispensing of controlled substances. 37 5.12 Office Hours Policy Faculty are expected to maintain weekly in person/virtual office hours. Students may visit their instructor to discuss course content , learn more about faculty research, and discuss other aspects of the graduate program in speech - language pathology. All faculty are expected to hold at least 1-2 hours of in person /virtual office hours per week (per course) for the duration of the semester in which the course is being taught. It is recommended that faculty supplement traditional office hours with virtual office hours (eg. Google Meet, Zoom ) and/or with by appointment options. All office hour options should be listed on the syllabi and published on any relevant course platforms. 5.13 Graduate Student Proficiency in English Screening Procedure and Position Statement Position Statement It is the position of the American Speech -Language -Hearing Association (ASHA) that \"students and professionals in communication sciences and disorders who speak with accents and/or dialects can effectively provide speech, language, and audiological services to persons with c ommunication disorders as long as they have the expected level of knowledge in normal and disordered communication, the expected level of diagnostic and clinical case management skills, and if modeling is necessary, are able to model the target phoneme, gr ammatical feature, or other aspect of speech and language that characterizes the client's particular problem. All individuals speak with an accent and/or dialect; thus, the nonacceptance of individuals into higher education programs or into the professions solely based on the presence of an accent or dialect is discriminatory. Members of ASHA must not discriminate against persons who speak with an accent and/or dialect in educational programs, employment, or service delivery, and should encourage an underst anding of linguistic differences among consumers and the general population.\" American Speech -Language -Hearing Association. (1998). Students and professionals who speak English with accents and nonstandard dialects: issues and recommendations [Position Statement]. Available from www.asha.org/policy.

All students are expected to respect facu lty, staff, fellow colleagues, clients, caregivers, and other professionals during their interactions. If a student violates professional behaviors, as indicated by the ASHA Code of Ethics, and the policies/procedures of the program, the student is at risk of being dismissed from the program. It is expected that all students attend their placement from the beginning of the semester to the end of the semester, regardless of them obtaining the required amount of hours for the placement/graduation. If a stude nt is going to be absent from their placement for any reason the student must notify the placement and the DCE at Stony Brook University of their absence in writing. The number of days the student attends placement depends on various factors including site requirements first and foremost, knowledge and experiences needed by the student, and hours required for that placement. This communication must be agreed upon by all parties -site supervisor, supervisor at Stony Brook University and the student prior to t he placement beginning. All students are expected to attend and participate in all scheduled clinical sessions, dates, and meetings as deemed necessary and appropriate by the site supervisor. The clinical dates, times, and sessions to participate are deter mined by the site supervisor based on caseload, clinical schedule, and didactic course schedule. The student is to arrive on time to the site and active participation in miscellaneous tasks may be required (documentation, billing, meetings) beyond the end time of the clinical day. These professional behaviors are indicated within a student's performance evaluation and grade for the clinical course. Students may be removed from a site due to unprofessional/unethical behavior on the part of the student or 41 supervisor, as well as health or safety. A student cannot choose to leave a clinical site without a process involving the DCE, the Chair of the department and Site Supervisor. If a student chooses to leave a clinical site on their own, they will fail the cli nical and not receive another clinical placement that semester. This will in turn delay their graduation. If a student is asked to leave the site due to their unprofessional/unethical behavior, the student will not be placed at another site that semester a nd their graduation will be delayed. The student will be placed on probation in the program. If the student is removed from the site due to a cause that is not their own, a second placement is not guaranteed that semester and can impact their graduation. If a student violates professional behaviors, as indicated by the ASHA Code of Ethics, and the policies/procedures of the program, the student will be placed on probation from the program. Dress Code Students are expected to wear appropriate attire during all clinicals (on -campus and off campus clinical experiences). Students are required to purchase scrubs (one pair burgundy for SBSH and black for SBUH) , white staff length labcoat, and liability insurance prior to the beginning of Clinical I. Students must be neat and clean including hair and nails. Students should avoid jewelry and tight clothing that can impact working in a professional practice. In consultation with the site supervisor, the student clinician will maintain professional appearance and dre ss based on the site (i.e. scrubs or business casual) throughout the clinical experience. The student should have their ID badge and it should be visible at all times during the clinical experience. Access to Computers and Storage There are computers loca ted in the library which is the building next to Atlantic Hall. In Atlantic Hall, students are not allowed in the faculty pantry area. Students have their own workspace and have access to a microwave in the library. 5.19 Communication, Social Media and Cell Ph one Policy Communication and Email Professional courtesy and professional behaviors are expected of students in the classroom, clinical sites, and in online communications. All written communication exchanges must contain an appropriate salutation, be well - written, respectful, and with a signature.

Students will also have access to Stony Brook medicine email accounts for when they are enrolled in Clinicals I, II, Audiology Clinical, and Diagnostic Clinical in order to maintain confidentiality for communications and report writing with their site su pervisors. Please review https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ombuds/resources/quick -tips/quicktipcommunication Students will also have access to stonybrook medicine email accounts for when they are enrolled in Clinicals I, II, Audiology Clinical and Diagnostic Clinical in order to maintain confidentiality for communications and report writing with their site supervisors. If a student is not able to attend a clinical session, date, or meeting due to an emergency, the student must contact the site supervisor, clinical instructor for seminar, and DCE to communicate the inability to attend and complete any additional sessions, clinical projects, and/or research assignments in lieu of missed clinical sessions and dates. If a student is unable to attend a class or meeting due to an emergency, the student must contact both the course instructor and chair to communicate the inability to attend and complete any addit ional coursework and/or research assignments in lieu of missed class sessions and dates. Social Media The Speech -Language Pathology program recognizes that social networking websites and applications, including, but not limited to, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snap Chat, YouTube and blogs, are a common form of communication. There is potential for misinterpretation of the relationship or the potential sharing protected information via these sites. Students are reminded that that should have NO expectation of privacy on these sites. Students need to be aware that posting certain information is a violation which can be penalized. Offenses could be considered non-academic misconduct or violation of professional behaviors and subject to program procedures and may result in dismissal from the program. Students must adhere to the ASHA Code of Ethics. The SLP department currently has a Facebook and Instagram accounts ( https://www.facebook.com/SLPSBU/ and https://instagram.com/sbuslp2020?utm_medium=copy_link ) The following is a list of online behaviors that are considered violations of social media policy and will result in a student bei ng placed on probation and then potentially being dismissed from the program : 42 1. It is a HIPAA violation if you mention a patient/client with enough information that the person might be identified. This includes posting of images. 2. Posting on social media the names, negative comments or criticisms of faculty, staff, or any clinical or university personnel is not acceptable. 3.

The Atlantic Ocean helps bring afternoon sea breezes that temper the heat in the warmer months and limit the frequency and severity of thunderstorms. Severe thunder storms are not uncommon, especially when they approach the island from the mainland areas of the Bronx, Westchester County and Connecticut in the northwest. Measurable snow falls every winter and in many winters one or more intense storms (called a Nor'eas ter) produce blizzard conditions with snowfalls of 1 -2 feet (30 - 60 cm) and near -hurricane force winds. Long Island is somewhat vulnerable to hurricanes. Its northern location and relatively cool waters tend to weaken storms to below hurricane strength by the time they reach Long Island, although despite this, some storms have made landfall at Category 1 or greater strength. In the wintertime, temperatures are warmer than areas further inland (especially in the night and early morning hours), sometimes causing a snowstorm further inland to fall as rain or mixed precipitation on the island. For weather -related information and/or school closings, monitor the SB Advisory page or call: 631-632-SNOW (7669) | 631-444-SNOW (7669) Students are required to sign up for alerts on the following site for information about weather emergencies: https://www.stonybrook .edu/commcms/emergency/alerts/ 5.24 Critical Incident Management and Emergency Communications Members of Stony Brook's Emergency Management Team have been working with Administration on a review of policies, procedures and programs to respond to and manage critical incidents on campus. The review addresses risk assessment and mental health issues, emergency response, communications technology and other general recommendations. The following is a summary of the assessment and actions taken to date. Please note that this list is not inclusive of all actions that can and will be done in the future, as this will be a continuous improvement process. Emergency Communications 1. Stony Brook has a Communications Plan for emergency responders using cell phones, pagers , email and portable radios to ensure communications and interoperability with each other and external agencies such as the Suffolk County Police and local fire departments. Emergency information is communicated to the campus community by way of our fire a larm systems, e -mail, web site, campus cable TV system and radio station (WUSB 90.1 FM) and external media sources. 2. Text, Voice and E-mail Messaging : Stony Brook has implemen ted a mass notification system with a private vendor to provide urgent communications to members of the campus community. Stony Brook University officials can also generate emergency messages by utilizing NY Alert, a similar system developed by the State Emergency Management Office (SEMO). 3. Outdoor Warning Siren: Stony Brook University has installed an outdoor siren alert on the University's main campus. While some individuals may hear the siren indoors, the siren is designed to be heard OUTDOORS ONLY. In the event of a true emergency that presents a safety concern, the University will sound the outdoor siren alert, which will last 60-seconds, and the following actions should be taken: 45 S STOP Stop what you are doing. O OBSERVE Observe your immediate surro undings for danger. S SHELTER Seek shelter and additional information. 4. Digital Signage: A software package has been purchased and new digital signage is being planned for installation in large assembly areas in campus buildings. The LCD displays will be centrally controlled with content directed to a particular geographic area. 5. Voice Fire/PA Systems: Fire alarm systems on campus are being upgraded to add additional voice -capable systems and to optimize their voice capability. This will allow us to br oadcast an alternate emergency tone and voice message over the speaker system. 6. Campus Safety Website : A new Campus Safety \"Staying Safe on Campus\" website has been established as a resource for the campus community. The website has links to important emergency, safety, security, health, counseling and other information. 7. An Emergency Command Vehicle (SUV), equipped with communications equipment will be used as a mobile command post at major incidents where University officials will work together in a unified command with external agencies. Emergency Management and Response 1. Stony Brook University has a comprehensive Emergency Management (All Hazards) Plan that establishes the policy, procedures, and organizational structure to respond, control and recover from emergency situations, using the National Incident Management Training System (NIMS). 2. An Emergency Operatio ns Center (EOC) is used by a team of University Officials, the Incident Commander, and Command Staff to evaluate situations and plan for the effective management of the people, organizations, and resources utilized in response to emergencies. 3. Emergency Responders, including University Police Officers, Fire Marshals, Building Managers, Safety Wardens, and Residential Hall staff respond to and evaluate emergency situations using the Incident Command System (ICS). 4. Critical Incident Plans and Training: Our University Police Department, in partnership with the Suffolk County Police Department (SCPD), has reviewed Critical Incident Response Plans and provided training to all UPD Officers for \"active shooting\" situations. In addition, UPD Officers have received training on the National Incident Management System (NIMS), Mental Health Disorders, Firearms Training and Incident Response. Table -top exercises are frequently conducted as part of an effort to better p repare our Emergency Responders for an actual event. 5. Fire Safety: Our University Fire Marshals have recently expanded operations to provide fire safety coverage round - the-clock (24/7). Fire Marshals are highly trained for response to fires, fire alarms, hazardous material incidents, technical rescues, and other emergencies. They work closely with local volunteer fire departments which facilitates the response and recovery from emergency situations. A number of fire prevention activities are held annually during the month of September during Campus Fire Safety Month.

All individuals speak with an accent and/or dialect; thus, the nonacceptance of individuals into higher education programs or into the professions solely based on the presence of an accent or dialect is discriminatory. Members of ASHA must not discriminate against persons who speak with an accent and/or dialect in educational programs, employment, or service delivery, and should encourage an understanding of linguistic differences among consumers and the general population.

This form is to be used primarily as a self -assessment tool by students. Rank each core ability within the shaded box in accordance with the descriptors below the numbered line. The ranking represents a continuum for expected student progress during the academic portion of the curriculum. A separate form will be used for self -assessment during the clinical portion of the program. The descriptors below the boxes serve as examples of the behaviors expected for that part icular ability. The ranking is to be completed by each student: - Each Fall and Spring semester. - Prior to required faculty/student advisement conferences. Students may enter the program with several of these abilities fully developed. Other abilities may require further development. Ranking should be done accordingly. Students are expected to submit this form prior to their scheduled advisement session. Students should use feedback from multiple sources when self -assessing. When asked, students shou ld be able to support their rankings with specific program related examples. Feedback might come from: - Written comments - Non-verbal messages - Self awareness - Faculty - Supervisors - Classmates A different self -assessment form is used for the clinical education phase of the program. 77 Adapted from: Model for Ability -Based Assessment in Physical Therapy Education, WW May, et al.
