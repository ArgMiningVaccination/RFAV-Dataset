How does the treatment work? Sterile, single-use, very fine needles are inserted at acupuncture points on the body, according to traditional Chinese medicine. It is suggested that these needles stimulate the central nervous system, releasing neurotransmitters and hormones that carry signals to different parts of the body, depending upon the acupuncture points selected and techniques used. A trained acupuncturist determines the specific treatment based upon a clinical assessment, the relevant points for the diagnosis and the proper type of stimulus for each point. Needles, once positioned, may be moved or twirled, with heat incorporated as appropriate. Electroacupuncture, which involves passing a low-frequency electrical current between pairs of acupuncture needles, may also be used. Because acupuncture needles are extremely fine, you will typically experience little or no discomfort as they are inserted or removed. Some people may feel a tingling or heaviness. Treatment is 30-90 minutes. It may be administered once, several times or more, depending on the condition. Who benefits from acupuncture? Acupuncture has shown benefits in treating low-back pain, neck pain, and osteoarthritis or knee pain. People who experience tension headaches and migraine headaches may see positive results from this form of treatment. Many other conditions may benefit from acupuncture treatment, alone or in conjunction with related care, including: - Arthritis - Asthma - Cancer treatment - Constipation/ Diarrhea - Digestive Disorders - Nausea - Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) - Painful Periods - Sciatica Services Acupuncture uses small needles inserted into specific acupoints on the body to treat various conditions. Electroacupuncture is a variation of acupuncture where a small electrical current is passed between pairs of acupuncture needles, augmenting the use of regular acupuncture. A recent study by Samueli Institute researchers has shown that repetitive electroacupuncture releases a kind of natural opioid that lowers blood pressure. The results suggest this therapy may be effective in treating clinical hypertension with few, if any, side effects.
