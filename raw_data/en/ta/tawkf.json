Social media provides its worldwide users with an instantaneous means for connecting and sharing news/ beliefs/hearsay - whether truthful or false. Global pandemics and disease outbreaks typically lead to infodemics - social media exacerbates infodemics through quick connectedness and unvetted echo chambers Healthcare providers can utilize social media tools and resources to combat vaccine misinformation.Misinformation Curr Opin Pediatr 2022, 34:156 -162 Government of the District of Columbia23Research has shown that Russian bots and troll farms, in conjunction with Russia's foreign broadcast network RT, have pushed anti -vaccination messages on a large scale on Western social media. These messages may be part of a broader effort to strategically undermine public health in both the developed and developing world. Examples: In the Democratic Republic of the Congo during both the 2014 and 2019 Ebola outbreaks, campaigns argued that foreign medical workers were spreading the disease, contributing to attacks that killed or wounded dozens of medical workers. Disinformation campaigns argued alternately that COVID -19 was an American -developed weapon or caused by 5G cellular networks has also been pushed by Russian bot networks.
