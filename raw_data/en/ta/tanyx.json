For example, if you plan to begin medical school directly after graduating from UCLA, you must submit your application at the end of your junior year. This timeline is meant to provide a general idea of what to expect during the medical school selection process, but is not exact and some schools may differ. For specific application dates and deadlines, visit the [Medical School Admission Requirements](https://apps.aamc.org/msar-ui/#/landing), the [AMCAS website](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/article/participating-medical-schools-deadlines/), and the websites of your potential medical schools. - May: AMCAS opens. Students can start begin entering their information into the medical school application. - June: First week of June, AMCAS submission begins. Since medical schools review and applicants on a rolling basis, it is advisable to submit your application as early in the cycle as possible. - June-August: A few weeks after you have submitted your AMCAS application, individual medical schools will begin sending secondary applications to the applicants they wish to consider. Aim to complete and submit within two weeks of receiving them. - August-March: Interviews. - February: Can anonymously indicate which school you are planning to enroll in using the [Choose Your Medical School (CYMS)](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/article/amcas-choosing-your-medical-school-tool/)tool, but may continue to interview and hold your acceptances at other schools. - April 30: Your \"Plan to Enroll\" indication in CYMS will no longer be anonymous. Beginning on April 30 you must hold an acceptance at only one institution, though you may remain on multiple alternate lists. - April-July: Acceptance, waitlist, and rejection notifications will be sent up until the beginning of medical school. As soon as you receive an offer from your preferred institution, withdraw your application from all other institutions and select \"Commit to Enroll\" in CYMS. Become familiar with Application and Acceptance Protocols for [admission officers](http://students-residents.aamc.org/admission-off)and [applicants.](http://students-residents.aamc.org/applicants) - August - Begin Medical School! Helpful External Links (not affiliated with UCLA) Entrance Exam The [Medical College Admission Test\u00ae (MCAT\u00ae)](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/taking-mcat-exam/about-mcat-exam/) is a standardized, multiple-choice examination designed to assess your problem solving, critical thinking, and knowledge of natural, behavioral, and social science concepts and principles prerequisite to the study of medicine. The [MCAT exam tests content](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/article/whats-mcat-exam/) found in introductory-level courses at most undergraduate institutions, including biology, general and organic chemistry, and physics, as well as first-semester biochemistry, psychology, and sociology. Financially disadvantaged applicants can apply for the MCAT Fee Reduction Program. [Medical School Admission Statistics by MCAT Section Scores](https://www.sairo.ucla.edu/2018-amcas-score) - View how UCLA students' and graduates' MCAT scores correlate with admission to medical schools. When should I take the MCAT? At the latest, the MCAT should be taken by May of the year you apply to medical school. It is recommended to take the MCAT even earlier (fall or winter before applying) so that you have time to take the exam again if you would like to try to improve your score. Medical schools will see your scores from every time you have taken the MCAT and each program views and considers the scores differently. For this reason, it is important not to take the MCAT until you are fully prepared and as comfortable with the content as possible. Most medical schools only accept MCAT scores within two years of the exam date, though some accept them for three years.

Gather Transcripts AMCAS requires one official transcript from each U.S., U.S. Territorial, or Canadian post-secondary institution at which you have attempted coursework, regardless of whether credit was earned. To determine whether or not an official transcript is required for one of your undergraduate institutions, consult the [AMCAS Applicant Guide](https://students-residents.aamc.org/content/downloadable/2231/). Transcripts must be sent directly from the registrar's office. For additional information on transcript submission please visit [https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/article/section-4-course-work/](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/article/section-4-course-work/) and [https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/faq/amcas-faq/](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/faq/amcas-faq/). Letters of Recommendation In most cases, medical schools request a minimum of three recommendations: two from science professors and one from a non-science professor or an extracurricular supervisor. Unless specifically instructed not to send additional letters , competitive applicants commonly send as many as five to six recommendations, including those from additional academic sources, clinical mentors, supervisors in extracurricular activities, and research sources. AMCAS accepts applicants' letters of evaluation via the [AMCAS Letter Service](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/article/amcas-letter-service/) and distributes them to participating medical schools electronically. This service enables letter authors to send their letters to AMCAS rather than to each individual school. Letter writers may submit letters through the [AMCAS Letter Writer Application](https://services.aamc.org/letterwriter/), [Interfolio](https://www.interfolio.com/dossier/), or by mail. Some schools request a Committee Letter. UCLA does not provide a Committee Letter and, therefore, it is not required as part of your application.
