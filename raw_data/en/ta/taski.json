ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words) These guidelines will assist trans it agencies in developing drug and alcohol testi ng programs that comply with regulations of t he Federal Transit Administration (FTA). These regula tions were first published in the Federal Register on February 15, 1994, as Prevention of Prohibited Drug Use in Transit Operations (49 CFR Part 653) and Prevention of Alcohol Misuse in Transit Operations (49 CFR Part 654), and later revised and combined into one regulation (49 CFR Part 655) on August 1, 2001. These guidelines are directed to transit agencies receiving federal funding under sections 5307, 5309, and 5311 of the Federal Transit Act, a nd section 103(e)(4) of title 23 of the U.S. Code. In addition, these guidelines will assist state agencies that receive FTA funding and contract ors who perform safety-sensitive services for transit agencies. These guidelines provide a comprehensive, up-to-date summary of the regulatory require ments, incorporating into one publication all of the guidance the FTA has issued over the past several years including technical assistance, letters of interpretation, audit findin gs, newsletters, training classes, and public speaking engage ments. The pertinent regulations are cr oss-referenced throughout the text and are reprinted in their entirety in Appendix I. Forms, checklists , and lists of additional information and services are provided throughout the docume nt. The companion volume to this guide ( Best Practices manual) discusses \"best practices\" used by em ployers to establish and maintain compliant testing programs. 15. NUMBER OF PAGES 752 14.

INTRODUCTION Section 1. PURPOS E AND S COPE OF TH ESE GUIDELINES The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) recognizes that prohibited drug use and alcoho l misuse affect everyon e in the United States. In response to passage of the Omnibus Transportation Em ployee Testing Act of 1991, FTA published two regulations in February 1994, prohib iting d rug us e and alcohol m isuse by transit em ployees and requiring th at transit agencies test for prohibited drug use and alcohol m isuse. These regulations were published as 49 CFR Part 653, Prevention of Prohibited Drug Use In Transit O perations , and 49 CFR Part 654, Prevention of Alcohol Misuse in Transit Operations . These regulations were updated on August 1, 2001, and consolidated into one regulation. The new regulation, 49 CFR Part 655, Prevention of Alcohol Misuse and Prohibited Drug Use in Transit Operations, incorporates guidance that FTA previously issued th rough letters of interpretation, newsletters, training cl asses, and co mpliance audits. In addition, the Department of Transportation (DOT) issued 49 CFR Part 40 Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs , on Decem ber 1, 1989, which prescribed testing m ethods. Following the publication of several am endments, letters of interpretation, and DOT program guidelines, the regulation underwent a m ajor revision. The revised 49 CFR Part 40 was published on Decem ber 19, 2000, with an effective date of August 1, 2001. Com plete copies of the regulations are located in Appendix I. To assist transit ag encies in implementing these regulations, FTA and DOT have developed a com plement of technical ass istance too ls includ ing procedural m anuals and reports, training workshops, videos, sem inars, and Web- based resources. Central to this technical assistance effort is FTA's publication of the Chapter 1. Introduction 1-1 August 2002 Implementation Guidelines for Drug and Alcohol Regulations in Mass Transit , Best Practic es manual, and the quarterly FTA newsletter Drug and Alcohol Regulation Updates . These guidelines provide a comprehensive, up-to-date summ ary of the regulatory requirem ents, incorporating into one publication all of the guidance F TA has issued over the past several years through technical assistance, le tters of interpretation, audit findings, newslette rs, training classes, and public speaking engagem ents. Together, th ese thr ee pu blica tions w ill provide covered em ployers with the necessary in formation to becom e and rem ain compliant with the regulations. The ultim ate goa l for FTA and the U.S. tr ansit industry is to achieve a drug- and alcohol- free workforce in th e interest of th e health and safety of e mployees and the public. Other resources are discussed in Section 3 of this ch apter. These guidelines explain the various elem ents of a com pliant program and contain examples of docum ents, checklists, forms, and procedures that m ay be used by individual transit system employers in formulating their program s. The following required elem ents of a drug and alcohol program are discussed: Implem entation Guide lines Policy and procedure developm ent These guidelines are written to ass ist employers in developing com pliant program s based on the revised FTA and DOT rules. Em ployers with well- established drug a nd alcohol testing program s can also use these guide lines to assess their level of compliance, validate policies and procedures, and identify areas that require modification based on the revised FTA and DOT rules. Employee and supervisor education and training Testing categories Drug testing procedures Alcohol testing procedures Substance A buse Professionals (SAPs) Record keeping and reporting All FTA-covered em ployers were requir ed to b e in com pliance with th e revised DO T procedures for drug and alcohol testing (49 CF R Part 40) and the FTA regulations on the prevention of alcohol m isuse and prohibited drug use (49 CFR Part 655) by August 1, 2001. These requirem ents are unaffected by the size of the transit agency, the num ber of vehicles in the fleet, or the num ber of e mployees. All covered em ployers who perform FTA safety-sensitive duties following these dates, must be in com pliance prior to conducting these du ties. Chapter 1. Introduction 1-2 August 2002 Transit em ployers m ay go beyond these requir ements to inco rporate add itional features (such as Em ployee Assistance Program s and additional testing circum stances) that are not m andated by FTA regulations. Additional provisions that go beyond the regulatory requirem ents m ust be clearly represented as features included under the authority of th e transit agency and not the FTA-m andated program . For exam ple, if you test for drugs other than the specific five that FTA requires, you must make the employees aware that they are being tested for those ad dition al drugs under the autho rity of the trans it agency, no t FTA. A separate s pecim en must also b e collected to analyze the additional drugs. Policies and procedures beyond the regulatory scope are not addressed in this manual to avoid confusion and misinterpretation over which provisions are requirem ents of the regulation and which are additional features. Discussion of best practices an d exam ples of additional policies and procedu res are inclu ded in the Best Practic es manual th at serves as a sis ter docum ent to this publication. Best Practices The Best Practices manual was published to supplem ent the Im plem entation Guidelines by providing exam ples of \"real world\" policies, procedures, sam ple form s, and narrative descriptions of approaches that have been successfully used by transit employers to effectively m anage their drug and alcohol testing program s. Though the regulations are very comprehensive and address each of the m ajor com ponents of a legally defensible program , the regulations represent only the m inimum requirem ents. Transit em ployers are en couraged to develop a program that goes beyond these minimum requirem ents to reflect the unique nature of the em ployer, operating environm ent, labor/m anagement relationsh ip, and exis ting polic ies and procedures. The exam ples provided in the Best Practic es manual r epresent m aterials that transit em ployers have f ound effective to help them efficiently m anage their program s, and to com ply with the regula tions. In som e cases, m ultiple exam ples are given to address th e sam e issue or requ irement. These best p ractices are not required m ethods of i mplementation, but are examples of how som e system s have dealt with p articula rly difficult is sues. Updates New sletter The Im plementation Guideline s is a comprehensive summ ary of the regulations and supercedes previous guidance provided by FTA. Gi ven the dynam ic nature of the drug and alcohol testing industry and the practical insights obtained following implementation of the regulations, it is expected tha t additiona l clar ification s, correction s, explanati ons, and procedural guidance will be necessary overtim e to supplem ent these guidelines. Consequently, FTA publishes a quarterly newsletter entitled, FTA Drug and Alcohol Regulation Updates, which keeps covered em ployers informed of the regu latory clarificatio ns, Chapter 1. Introduction 1-3 August 2002 corrections, and any new FTA interpretations. The newsletter is a continuance of the guidelines, and as such, each page of the newsletter references the section of the guidelines to which it relates. To be added to the m ailing list f or the newsletter, please register on FTA's homepage (transit-saf ety.volpe.dot.gov) or fax your request to FTA's Office of Safety and Security at (202) 366-7951. If you would like a ddition al copies of these guidelines, you m ay reproduce as m any copies as you need. You m ay also download copies from the FTA's Office of Safety and Security homepage. A list of Web addresses is provided in the Sample Docum entation section of this chapter. Section 2. HO W TO US E THES E GUIDELINES These guidelines are a ready reference for those in the trans it industry who must develop and im plement program s to control substance abuse. The guidelines are organized b y subject, an d each subject is addressed in the genera l order it would be confronted in the actual for mulation and implementation of a drug and alcohol program . Each m ajor subject is discussed in a separate section. Corresponding reference docum ents, for ms, and checklists are included in the Sam ple Docum entation section at the end of each chapter. These materials were design ed to m eet the minimum regulatory requirem ents contained in 49 CFR Parts 40 and 655. Material in the Appendices am plifies basic information in the guidelines, identif ies ad dition al resources or ref erences, and provides specific detailed inform ation on subjects that m ay be ancillary to the guidelines or applicab le only to certain situations or transit operations. You should read Appendix H, \"Term s and Defi nitions,\" first if you are unfam iliar with som e of the language used. The inf ormation in this d ocument addresses only the regulatory m inimum and does not cover any add itional aspects of a substance abuse m anagem ent program. The inform ation presented, however, is essential in developing and assessing a com pliant, comprehensive, and defensible program . These guidelines do no t take precedence over or alter any requirem ent established under FTA or DOT regulations. Certain key words are used throughout the text to assist you in differentiating between required program elem ents and optional suggestions for a better program . Section num bers from the regulations are also used to m ore clearly define regulatory requirem ents. For exam ple, \u00a7655.4 means this regulation is specifically mentioned in 49 CFR Part 655, Section 4. Similarly, \u00a740.25 references 49 CFR Part 40 Section 25. To clarify som e difficult subjects and give practical guidance on how to address many of these issues, explanatory flow charts, d ecision trees, ch ecklists, and tables have been provided in these guidelines. Chapter 1. Introduction 1-4 August 2002 Recommend ation: Know the Regulations Every transit employer's Drug and Alcohol Program Manager (DAPM ) should read and re-read the regulations several times. If poss ible, the DAPM should participate in periodic conferences, workshops, and information al meeting s on the subje ct as they become available. The DAPM should ask questions of other transit system program managers, State Department of Transportation staff, the FTA Office of Safety and Security staff, as well as other people in the community that have knowledge of the subject. With each new reading, questions, or discussion, subtle ties of the regu lation will be uncovered a nd new or differ ing interpr etations will be fo und. The process should be considered ongoing and requires a certain degree of tenacity. An ongoing effort to know and remain up-to- date with th e regula tions is ess ential to maintain a compliant program. Section 3. OTHER RESOURCES While every attem pt has been m ade to make these guidelines com plete, FTA has produced ad dition al manuals, train ing aids, and inform ational report s to further assist trans it em ployers in the successf ul implementation of a compliant program . For instance, Chapter 6 \"Types of Testing,\" provides a general discussion on the random testing portion of your drug and alcohol program . However, FTA published a separate publication, the Random Dr ug Testing Manual , to provide detailed guidance on how to im plement a comprehensive and defensible random drug testing regim en as part of an overall substance abuse m anagem ent program. The USDOT, Office of Drug and Alcohol Program Compliance also publishes procedural g uidelines for service agents including collection s ite personnel, Medical Review Officers (MRO), and Substance Abuse Professionals (SAP). W here appropriate, these addi tional resou rces are identified. The Sam ple Docum entation section at the end of this chap ter contains a list of sources of addition al information that you may wish to acquire to assist in the implementation and evaluation of your substance abuse m anagem ent program. The FTA Drug and Alcohol Regulation Updates newsletter is another source of inform ation, as it announces the publication of new materials an d includes a list of resource materials that is kept current. Regulatory Text Statem ents in this m anual tha t refer to regulatory requirements contain the words \" shall \" or \" must : (e.g., \"A substance abuse m anagem ent program shall includ e policy statem ent...\"). Program elem ents not explic itly required by regulations, but suggested as an integral part of successful implementation are generally addressed using the word \" should .\" Optional elem ents, or those prog ram features that have several acceptable alternatives, are norm ally expressed by use of the word \"may.\" FTA's W eb site (www.fta.dot.gov) can also be accessed to obtain accurate and up- to-the-m inute inform ation about the FTA drug and alcohol tes ting regulations and related topics. This site provides various links which access inform ation from different FTA offices. You can read FTA's mission statem ent, strategic plan, news releases, calendar of events, regional office inform ation, and m essages from the Adm inistrator. Chapter 1. Introduction 1-5 August 2002 Under \"Offi ces,\" you can visit the O ffice of Chief Counsel to view FTA's drug and alcohol testing letters of interpretation and the Federal Register where you can download the exact text of relevant regulatory changes and FTA interpretations. The interpretations clarif y and explain FTA's regulatory intent regarding actual, practical, and operational problem s experienced by transit employers. You can also obtain infor mation directly from the Office of Safety and Security by accessing \"Program Managem ent\" and then \"Safety.\" Or, you can visit the National Transit Library to perform searches on key words or topics. Direct hom epage addresses for these and other relevant W eb sites are provided in the Sam ple Docum entation section at the end of this chapter. The FTA also provides technical assistance through training workshops and seminars. Through the Transportation Safety Institute (TSI), F TA provides a course on substance abuse program manage ment and self-assessm ent. The course provides an overview of the regulations including all updates, relevant FTA interpretations, the audit process, and best practices. The workshop for mat prom otes a high level of interaction and includes hands-on use of a program self- assessm ent checklist. T he TSI cours es are provided on a cost-recovery basis with enrollm ent controlled by the host. For m ore inform ation regarding these courses, call TSI at (405) 954-3682. FTA also periodically offers regional sem inars that provide an overview of the regulations. These sem inars are des igned to accomm odate large numbers of atten dees and are p resented in a lecture h all format. Chapter 1. Introduction 1-6 August 2002 Sample Documentation Chapter 1.

REGULATORY OVERVIEW Implementing or updating an FTA- required drug and alcohol program may require you to m odify existing substance abuse policies and program s, or in som e cases, develop entirely new programs. Since the critical prog ram elem ent is drug and alcohol testing of employees in position s that requ ire the perf ormance of safety-sensitive functions. It is in this context that you must formulate drug and alcohol policies, comm unicate them to your em ployees, and conduct drug and alcohol tests. The goals of these activ ities a re to enhance worker productivity and safety and to ensure positiv e acc eptance of the program . In keeping with the stated objective of enhancing productivity and safety, you are encouraged to m ake your drug and alcohol program an integral part of your overall system safety program plan. Failure of an em ployer to develop a program and im plement the program in compliance with this reg ulation m ay result in the suspension of federal tr ansit funding. Section 1. WHAT THE REGULATIONS REQ UIRE The FTA regulations require the following program elements be implemented: A policy statem ent on prohibited drug use and alcohol m isuse in the workplace including consequences (see Chapter 4, \"Policy Developm ent and Communication\"). An e mployee and supervisor education and training program (see Chapter 5, \"Train ing\"). A drug and alcohol testing program for prohibited substances for employees and applicants for Chapter 2. Regulatory Overview 2-1 August 2002 employm ent in saf ety-sensitive position s (see Chapter 6, \"Types of Testing,\" Chapter 7, \"Drug Testing Procedures,\" and Chapter 8, \"Alcohol Testing Procedures\"). Violations Throughout this docum ent, you will see references to \"violations\" of or \"violating\" the requirements. These terms will re fer to any sa fety-sensitiv e employee who has: A verif ied positive drug test An alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater Refused to subm it to a te st Adulterated or substitu ted a specim en Referral of the em ployee who has violated the drug and alcohol regulations to a Substance Abuse Professional (see Chapter 9 \"Substance Abuse Professional, Rehabilitation and Treatm ent\"). Adm inistrative procedures for record keeping, reporting, releasing inform ation, and certifying co mpliance (see Chapter 10, \"Adm ents\"). Section LITY Who Must Participate? Any recipient or subrecipient of federal financial assistance under 49 United States Code (USC) Sections 5307, 5309, or 5311 of the Federal T ransit Act as am ended, or any recipient of federal financial assistance under Section 103(e)(4 ) of Title 23 of the United States Code m ust com ply with these regulations (\u00a7655.3). Generally, these are transit agencies that receive FT A funding and state agencies that ass ist in distribu ting FTA funding to transit agencies. Section 5310 operators that do not receive any Section 5307, 5309, or 5311 funding are exem pt from the FTA drug and alcohol regulations, but m ay be covered by the Federal Mo tor Carrier S afety Adm inistration's (FMCSA) drug and alcohol testing regula tion if the vehicle operators are required to hold Comm ercial Driver's Licenses (CD L). Chapter 2. Regulatory Overview 2-2 August 2002 The regulations also apply to any contractor w ho perform s safety-sensitive functions for a recipi ent or subrecipient of federal assistance as defined above. Exem pt are contractor s of rural operators, including those that receive Section 5311 funding and operators that serve populations under 200,000 and receive funding through the Section 5309 discretionary capital funding program and the Section 5307 urban funding program , including Job Access. Some transit agencies co uld be affected by drug and alcohol testing regulations of m ore than one USDOT modal agency. These include transit agencies operating ferry boats, com muter railroads, or vehicles that require operators to hold Commercial Driver's Licenses (CDLs). In th ose cases, F TA has coordinated respon sibility with the other m odal agencies to m inimize overlapping requirem ents. U.S. Coast Guard. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) will be d eemed in concurrent com pliance with the testing requirem ents of 49 CFR Part 655 when they com ply with the USCG's chem ical and alcohol testing requirem ents. However, f oper ations will r to F TA's random alcohol testing requirem ents because th e USCG does not have a sim ilar requirem ent. Federal Railroad Administration. The Federal Railroad Adm inistration (FRA) and FTA have agreed that commuter railroad operators who receive FTA funds a re exem pt from com pliance with FTA's testing regulations. However, these operators m ust certify to FTA as specified in Section 655.83 that they ar e in f ull com pliance with th e FRA substance abuse regulations set forth in 49 CFR Part 219 for its railroad operations. A sam ple certification le tter can be found in the Sam ple Docum entation section at the end of this chapter. The recipien t must follow Part 655 requirem ents for its non-rail saf ety- sensitive operations, if any. Commercia l Driver's Licenses. The Federal Mo tor Carrier S afety Adm inistration (FMCSA) and FTA have agreed that transit agencies with safety- sensitive em ployees holding CDLs are covered by the FTA drug and alcohol regulations. However, individual CDL holders remain subject to FMCSA sanctions and other ram ifications for FMCSA rule violations, which are not included in the FTA drug and alcohol regulations (i.e., loss of CDL for one year following a positiv e alco hol tes t of 0.04 or greater). The regulations prom ulgated by each of the USDOT m odes a re very sim ilar and address the sam e basic principles. However, the regulations are different in that they reflect th e operating environm ent and regulatory authority unique to each m ode. Si nce m any transit system s are associated w ith oth er entities that fall under the FMC SA rule, they have assum ed incorrectly that a program that is com pliant with on e modal administration's regu lation will a lso be in compliance with the other's regulation. The regulations are s imilar, but they are not identical. The prim ary areas of difference b etween the F TA and FMCSA regulations are summ arized in th e Sample Docum entation section at th e end of this chapter. Chapter 2. Regulatory Overview 2-3 August 2002 What happens in these cases? The public transit industry is complex, representing a variety of operating environm ents, system designs, modes of operation, and organizational structures. As such, several issues h ave arisen rega rding the app licab ility of the FTA regulations in different situations. The following guidance is provided on the m ost commonly raised of these issues. Contractors Covered Under the Regulations of Other Modes. Many trans it sys tems contract with saf ety- sensitive co ntractors wh o are alread y required to com ply with the drug and alcohol testing regulations of other modes (i.e., FMCSA). If these contractors are ab le to s egregate the employees who provide transit service from those who perf orm saf ety-sen sitive functions for the other modes, the employer is required to establish program s for each g roup of em ployees allowing for the corresponding differences in the m odal rules. However, if the contractor's employees perform safet y-sensitive functions for both transit and another mode, the employer m ust determ ine which m odal adm inistration regulates the majority (>50 percent) of the em ployees' who perf orm saf ety-sen sitive functions covered under the USDOT. Once determ ined, em ployee will be sub ject to pre-em ploym ent and random testing under the regulatory authority of the prim ary m odal adm inistration. The assignm ent of regulatory authority for reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing will depend on the function an employee is perform ing at the tim e of the incident/accident. Return-to-duty and follow-up tests will be assigned to the modal adm inistration that generated the initial po sitive tes t resu lt. Brokerages and Human Service Agency Transportation Coordination. Agencies th at prov ide several transportation program s under one umbrella su ch as a brok erage o r a human service trans porta tion coordination system need only test the public transportation com ponent of the services as long as the servi ces are distinctly separate. Specifica lly, if there is no interm ixing of funds or personnel, the services are considered separate and the non-FTA funded transportation program s are not subject to FTA's drug and alcohol testing rules. However, if the program is integrated, the service is provided under contract interchang eably, and/or the service is funded all or in part by federal transit funds, the se rvice providers are included. The only ex ception is w hen the brokerage is set up as a user-side subsidy program where the passengers choose which servic e provide r they will us e. In this c ase, th e service pro vider is exe mpt because the broker or ag ency has no contract with the service provider, and no control over the passengers' decision- making. In situations w here there is some minimal overlap of duties or shared responsibilities of staff (i.e., backup driver in an em ergency, shared dispatcher), FTA considers th is \"incidental overlap,\" and does not require coverage of the individuals perform ing the incidental job functions. Pass-Through Funding . In situations w here a trans it system serves only as a conduit to pass-through non- FTA funding to anot her transportation Chapter 2. Regulatory Overview 2-4 August 2002 agency, FTA has concluded that the latter is not covered by the regulations. The pass-through funds must be clearly identified and distinct from other FTA funds. Taxicab Operators. The regulations apply to taxicab operators when the trans it provider enters in to a contrac t with one or m ore entities to provide taxi servic e as pa rt of the pub lic trans it service. Drug and alcohol testing rules do not apply to taxicab operators when service is provided where patrons are allowed to choose the taxicab com panies that will pro vide the serv ice. Charters, Vehicle Leas es, and Motor Pools. Transit sy stem s will sometimes form ally or inf ormally le ase their revenue service vehicles to provide charter services or to supplem ent hum an service transportation program s. In som e cases, th e arrangem ents are m ade on an incidental or ad hoc basis. In others, the arrang ements are well es tablished, formalized, and provided on a routine basis. The regulations state that the drug and alcohol rules apply to any entity that perform s a safety-sensitive function (i.e., operation of a revenue service vehicle, including when not in revenue service) consistent w ith a specific understanding or arrangement. The understanding can be a written contract or an inform al arrang ement between the parties. Consequently, transit system s that have established an ongoing relationship with other agencies o r com panies to provide revenue service vehicles, m ust require that these entities estab lish an d maintain drug and alcohol testing program s compliant with the FTA regulations f or the portion of the business that uses these vehicles. In instances where vehicles are provided on a one-tim e or incidental basis, and there is no ongoing relationship (i.e., m ayor drives a bus in a parade, radio personality drives a bus during a vehicle rodeo), the regulations do not apply. Section 5310 Specializ ed Transportation Program. Since th e FTA regulations apply only to recipients of Section 5307, 5309, or 5311 funding, or any recipient of federal financial assistance under Section 103(e)(4) of Title 23 of the U.S. Code, those ope rators receiving only Sect ion 5310 funding are not requ ired to com ply with th e FTA testing regulations. However, those Section 5310 recipients who have drivers holding CDLs m ust comply with FMCSA's drug and alcohol testing program s (49 CFR Part 382). Chapter 2. Regulatory Overview 2-5 August 2002 Section 3. SAFETY-SENSITIVE FUNCTIONS Operating a nonrevenue service vehicle that requires drivers to hold CDLs. Controlling dispatch or move ment of a revenue service vehicle. Since job duties and responsibilities of dispatchers vary by tran sit sys tem, each employer must decide whether the agencies' dispatcher perfor ms any functions that would pose a substantial immediate threat to public safety if im paired by drugs or alcohol. If the em ployer decides there is no threat, the dispatcher should be excluded. If the em ployer determ ines the dispatcher could im pact public safety, those i ndividuals should be included. Maintaining revenue s ervice vehicles or equipm ent used in revenue service including repairs, component overhaul, and rebuilding. The rule req uires that all maintenance contractors who stand in the shoes of an urbanized system serving a population of 200,000 or more to perf orm engine repair, revenue service vehicle repair, equipm ent repair, and com ponent rebuild/ overhaul must have a com pliant program that m eets th e sam e standards as the transit sy stem . A written contract between a grantee and its contractor is not required for the rule to apply. What Employees are A ffected? Employees of FTA recipients, subrecipients, and contractors who perform safety-sensiti ve functions must be included in an FTA com pliant substance abuse m anagem ent program (\u00a7655.4). F TA defines \"safety-s ensitive\" functions as follows: If the gran tee routinely u ses the same contractor for overhaul/rebuilding work, and the contractor expects to perfor m the grantee's overhaul/rebuilding Operating a revenue service vehicle including when not in revenue service. Chapter 2. Regulatory Overview 2-6 August 2002 Supervisors of e mployees in these categories, who do not them selves perform these functions, are excluded. Only supervisors who perform one of the safety-sensitive functions are covered. work based on a past relationship, then the con tractor is co vered under the rule. The rule does not apply when overhaul/rebuilding work is done on a one-tim e, incidental or em ergency basis, where there is no long-term contract or ongoing relationship between the grantee and its contractors. Maintenance work covered under the m anufacturer's warranty is excluded. Recommend ation Determine W ho is Safety-Sensitive Transit systems often have sev eral employee job classifications that, on the surface, do n ot appear to be safety- sensitive (i.e., secr etary, bus washer, general manager). However, a syste m should not rel y on job titles alone, but rather consider the actual j ob fu nctions that each employee perfor ms when determining their safety-s ensitive status . For example, a secretary w ho fills in for a dispatcher du ring lunch breaks, a bus washer who drives the r evenue servic e vehicles fro m the storage area to the wash bay, or a general manager who occasionally switches out vehicles, sho uld all be conside red safety-s ensitive ev en thoug h this s afety function would n ot necessaril y be reflected in their job title. Only the f irst-tier m aintenance contractors are included, thus, maintenance subcontractors (e.g., second tier) are not covered by the regu lations. See the decis ion tree provided in the Sam ple Docum entation section at the end of this chapter for furthe r clarification. FTA excludes m aintenance contractors that perform services for grantees that receive funding under Section 5309, 5307, and 5311 and serve an area under 200,000 in population. Volunteers are exem pt from the FTA drug and alcohol testing requirem ents unless they are required to operate a vehicle that requires a C ommercial Drivers License. FTA defines volunteers as non-em ployees who perform a service as a charitab le act witho ut the exp ectation of receiving benefit. Th ose who provide charitable services in return for som e benefit (i.e., workfare, community service as an altern ative to a crim inal sentence, academ ic credit, or paym ent by another agency) rem ain covered by the rule. Volun teers who rec eive m ileage reimbursement only are not considered to receive a benefit and as a result, are not covered. H owever, volunteers who receive rem uneration in excess of th eir personal expenses incurred while Providing security and carrying a firearm on transit vehicles, transfer points, and transit facilities op en to the pu blic. This does not include transit administration buildings and garage security. Sim ilarly, local law enforcem ent officers who provide security services for transit system s as part of their everyday po lice activities and who are not under the day-to-day control or direct supervision of the transit sy stem , are not covered by the FTA regulations. Chapter 2. Regulatory Overview 2-7 August 2002 perform ing the volunteer service are considered a covered em ployee. Figure 2-1 shows a process you can follow to determ ine whether an em ployee perform s a safety-sensitive function. Figure 2-2 gives further details on the categories of e mployees working in position s that are conside red saf ety- sensitive. Since job titles and corresponding duties are not consistent from syste m to system , individual job functions should be considered, rather than job titles. If an individual perform s any of the safety- sensitive job functions, then that individual should be cl assified as such. Chapter 2.

Safety-Sen sitive Employee Matrix Chapter 2. Regulatory Overview 2-10 August 2002 Section 4. EM PLO YER RESPONSIBILITI ES Establish Drug and Alcohol Program Manager Each transit em ployer covered under the FTA regulations should have one individual designate d as the Drug and Alcohol Program Manager (DAPM) who is responsible for adm inistering the program . The DAPM responsibilities are often assigned to an existing em ployee with othe r related duties in hum an resources, personnel, or risk manage ment. Often the DAPM is responsible for record keeping, preparation of the annual Managem ent Inform ation System (MIS) report, administering and scheduling the random testing process, a nd serving as the Designated Em ployer Representative (DER), or liaison with the drug and alcohol testing service agents. Even though not required, identifying a D APM as a single point of contact for the program is a critical com ponent of a successful testing program. Policy Sta tement You m ust adopt a policy statem ent on substance ab use in th e workplace (\u00a7655.15). At a m inimum, the policy must includ e the f ollowing: Identity of the person, office, branch, and/or position designated by the employer to answer questions about the em ployer's anti-drug use and alcohol m isuse program . The categories of e mployees who are subject to testing. A description of the prohibited behavior and conduct. A description of the specific circum stances under which an employee will b e tested (pre- employm ent, random , etc.). A description of the testing procedures that will be used to test for the use o f illega l drugs and alcohol m isuse, protect the em ployee and the in tegrity of the testing process, safeguard the validity of the test resu lts, and ensure the test resu lts are attributed to the co rrect em ployee. A statem ent of the requirem ent that a covered em ployee subm it to drug and alcohol testing. A description of the kind of behavior that con stitutes a r efusal to tes t, and statem ent that a r efusal constitu tes a violation of the policy. Chapter 2. Regulatory Overview 2-11 August 2002 A description of the consequences f or violating the drug and alcohol regulations including the mandatory FTA requirem ents, and the consequences for an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04. A detailed discussion on the specific requirem ents of the drug and alcohol program policy statem ent is provided later in Cha pter 4, \"Po licy Develop ment and Comm unication.\" An e mployer may impose additional requirem ents as long as the employee is infor med that the additional requirem ents are included under the employer's authority and the provisions are not contrary to, or inconsis tent with the p rovisions s et forth in the rule. Education and Training You m ust provide educational materials th at explai n the requirem ents of the FTA drug and alcohol testing regulations (\u00a7655.14) and your policies and procedu res to m eet these requirem ents for all safety-sensitive employees. Inform ation on the effects and consequences of substance abuse on personal health, safety, and the worksite, as well as in dicato rs of substance ab use, must be provided. Supervisors must receive additional training on the physical , behavioral, and perform ance indicators of substance abuse and alcohol m isuse if they are responsible for determ ining when a reasonable suspicion test is required. Chapter 5, \"Training,\" provides greater detail on the training requirem ents for employees and supervisors. Testing You m ust establish a drug (\u00a7655.21) and alcohol (\u00a7655.31) testing program that follows FTA regulations for drug testing (Chapter 7, \"Drug Testing Procedures\") and alc ohol testing (Chapter 8, \"Alcohol Testing Procedures\"). T he types of tests are: Pre-em ent Contractor Overs ight FTA recipients/sub recipients are fully responsible for the com pliance of their safety-sensitive contractors. Theref ore, each system should have a procedu re to ensure that all covered contractors comply with the ru les. T he FTA regulation (\u00a7655.73(i)) allows em ployees to disclose drug and alcohol testing inform ation, including individual test results, to th e state oversight agency or grante e requ ired to cer tify com pliance to FTA. Transit system s should not assum e that contractors are knowledgeable about the regu latory requir ements or that they have com pliant policies or program s. If contractors are unwil ling or unable to comply with the regu lations, the tran sit system must discontinue using the contractor f or the perform ance of sa fety- sensitive du ties, or they will jeopard ize their FTA funding. See Chapter 12 for additional infor mation. Service Agent Overs ight Transit em ployers are responsible for the in tegrity of their drug and alcohol Chapter 2. Regulatory Overview 2-12 August 2002 testing program and the quality of testing services pro vided by service agen ts. Consequently, transit em ployers m ust monitor the quality of its testing se rvice agents inclu ding collection sites, m edical review officers, and substance abuse professionals. The em ployer should not assum e that its service agents are following the correct procedures defined in 49 CFR Part 40, or that they are truly knowledgeable about the FTA regulations. Instead, employers should provide sufficient oversight to ensure compliance and to tak e corrective action when warranted. Com pliance with the s tate or loc al requirem ent is an obstacle to accom plishing and executing any requirem ent of these regulations. However, these regulations do not preem pt any state crim inal laws that impose sanctions for reckless conduct leading to loss of life, injury, or dam age to property. Some states have enacted laws perm itting the use of \"medicin al marijuana\" when recomm ended by a physician. The federal governm ent does not recognize the m edicinal use of marijuana as a legitim ate m edical explanation, and as such, any positive result attr ibuted to su ch use will b e considered a violation of these regulations. Administrative Requirements You m ust mainta in ce rtain testing records (\u00a7655.71). Such records and other personal data associated with the testing program are subject to certain conditions for release. Annual reports summarizin g the te st results m ust be prepared, an d upon requ est, subm itted to FTA (\u00a7655.72). You must certify compliance with the reg ulations eac h year (\u00a7655.83). Further discussion of the administrative requirements are found in Chapter 10, \"Adm inistrative Requirem ents.\" Section 5. STATE AND LOCAL ISSUES Preemption The FTA regulations (\u00a7655.6) preem pt any state or local law, rule, regulation, or order when: Litigation Com pliance with both the state or local requirem ent and these regulations is not possible; or Occasionally, FTA em ployers ' drug and alcohol testing program s are challenged in court. If litigation could affect the federal dr ug and alcohol testing program or individual FTA-assisted Chapter 2. Regulatory Overview 2-13 August 2002 You m ay expand upon the regulatory requirem ents to tailor a program to m eet specific needs. However, your policy should be very specific about what activities are conducted under federal regulations and what activities are conducted under your system 's own authority. projects, the em ployer should notify FTA immediately. Early notification of potentially significant litigation provides FTA m ore options and opportunities to defend its program s. Even if FTA does not par ticipate directly in the litig ation, FTA can provide background information and technical assistance. Do not notify FTA about routine personnel m atters or minor accidents, but the appropriate FTA regional counsel or the Office of the Chief Couns el should be notified once it becom es clear that an F TA program or regulation is at issu e. A summary of relev ant cou rt rulings is provided in the Sample Docum entation section of this chapter. Going Beyond the Regulatory Requirements Whenever you expand your drug and alcohol program beyond the regulatory requirem ents and include aspects not specifically required by the regulations, you m ust ensure that the em ployee is aware of which parts are FTA regulatory requirem ents, and which are your ow n extensions beyond the regulation. For exam ple, if you wish to test nonsafety- sensitive em ployees you m ay do this under your own authority, but you m ust establish a separate testing pool of those employees. Section 6. WHAT THE REGULATIONS DO NOT REQUIRE The FTA regulations focus on public safety, and therefore, they do not address a num ber of concerns co nsidered internal affairs of transit agencies. Som e of the issues that are not included in the F TA regulations are: The FTA Best Practices manual is an excellent resource for identifying efficient and effective practices th at meet and go beyond the regulatory requirem ents. The m anual contains sample policy language, for ms, training aids, and procedures. The FTA does not require testing of nonsafety-sensitive employees (although you m ay choose to do so under your own separate author ity). Testing for Other Substances The FTA does not require that you provide an Em ploye e Assistance Program (EAP) (although you m ay and are encouraged to do so). Although FTA regulations only require urine testing for five specified drugs and breath testing for alcohol, you may wish to include other substances that may be prevalent in your local area. Most testing laboratories offer urine- testing protocols for dozens of drugs including a panel of nine typical \"drugs of abuse\" (amphetam ines, cocaine, marijuana, opiates, phencyclidine, The FTA does not require a second-chance policy or employee rehabilitation and reinstatem ent (although you m ay do so). Chapter 2. Regulatory Overview 2-14 August 2002 methadone, m ethaqualone, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines). Recently, laboratories have developed testing protocols for the drug E cstasy (methylenedioxym ethamphetam ine, or MDMA). If you wish to test for other than the five drugs specified by the regulation, you m ust collect a separate urine spe cimen in addition to th e FTA specim en and notify the em ployee that this specim en is being tested under company authority. The testing m ust be kept separate to ensure that the integrity of the FTA-m andated tests are not compromised. Providing an Employee Assistance Program Employee Assistance Program s are not required by the FTA regulations. However, many em ployers provide these services, which are valued as a cost- effective employee benefit. In m any cases, EAPs provide SAP services. EAPs are traditionally offered by the em ployer, by a health care provider under contract with the em ployer, or by a health care provider no t affiliated with the em ployer. If an EAP is available, it should be noted in the po licy statem ent. Section 7. TH E CONS EQUENCES OF FAILURE TO CO MPLY Each recipient of FTA funds under 49 U. S. Code 5307, 5309, or 5311 or under 23 U.S. Code 103(e)(4) must certify compliance with these requirem ents on an annual basis or lose its elig ibility f or FTA federal funding (\u00a7655.82). Entities that receive FTA funding through Section 5307 and Section 5309 in urbanized areas certify as part of their annual list of Certif ications and Assura nces f or FTA Grants and Cooperative Agreem ents. If a state certifies a tran sit sys tem's compliance, then it is responsible to ensure th e system is complying with the requirem ents. Subsequently, the state DOT's m ust certify annually on behalf of their Section 5311 and Section 5309 recipients whose funding they adm inister. Since rural system s do not necessarily receive funding on an annual basis, FTA recomm ends that states should require annual letters from each of its current subrecip ients certifying com pliance with the drug and alcohol testing regulations. A sam ple letter is prov ided in the Sa mple Docum entation section chapter. A Section 5307, 5309, or 5311 subrecipient, through the adm inistering state, is subject to funding suspension (\u00a7655.82). A recipient is subject to criminal sanctions and fines for false statem ents or m isrepresentation under 18 U.S. Code 1001. Chapter 2.

Regulatory Overview 2-23 August 2002 Relevant Court Rulings 1. Liability of Service Agents Yasuko Ishikaw a v. Lab One In a high ly publicized co urt cas e (Yasuko Ishikaw a v. Lab One ), a jury aw arded a Delta Air Lines flight attendant $400,000 after a drug-t esting laboratory incorrectly reported that she had subs tituted a sp ecimen. Under DOT regulations, a su bstitu ted sp ecimen is consider ed a test ref usal. Consisten t with ai rline policy, the f light a ttendant was fired even though she insisted she never took drugs and did not alter her urine specim en. Subsequent investigation found that the labo ratory had not followed govern ment standards or their own internal testing protocols for conducting valid ity tests and had incorrectly reported the result as sub stituted whe n in fact it was not. Validity tes ts are used to determ ine if the specim en provided consists of norm al hum an urine or whether the specim en was s witched, ad ulterated, or altered in som e fashion. The tests m easure the pH creatin ine concentra tion an d specific g ravity of the specim en. Validity testing was not a required part of the DOT testing p rocedur e at the tim e of the tes t and therefore, the error was not a violation that resulted in the loss of the laboratory's Departm ent of Health and Hu man Services (DHHS) certification. However, the f light a ttendant sued th e laboratory and Delta. The case ag ainst Delta was dropped, but the case against the laborat ory was heard in a Portland, Oregon court. The jury found that the laboratory was negl igent and awarded the flight attendant financially. Even though the num ber of cases that this laboratory procedural error m ay have affected is believed to be low, the ex act number of individuals that m ay have fa llen victim to this faulty testing is unknown. The DOT be lieves this case is im portant becau se it holds serv ice agen ts accountable and lets them know there is the potential for a significant financial cost associated with mistakes that affect the livelihoods of DOT-cove red workers. Given this verdict, the pool of potential plaintiffs could increase significan tly. This case was also a p rimary im petus for the inclusion of validity testing in the revised Part 40 regulations. As soon as the DHHS publishes its m andatory gu idelines, v alidity testing tha t meets thes e federal guidelines w ill be a requ ired com ponent of DOT testing. Any laboratory that m akes a mistake of this m agnitude in the future will al so be subject to a Public Interest Exclusion (PIE)(Part 40, Subpart R). The DHHS insp ected all certified laboratories and took corrective action as necessary to rem edy proce dural e rrors. All cer tified labora tories are curren tly believed to b e in com pliance. 2. Medicin al Use of Marijuana United States v. Oakland Canna bis Buyers' Cooperative, et al Chapter 2. Regulatory Overview 2-25 August 2002 On May 14, 2001, the U.S, Suprem e Court ruled that m arijuana m ay not be distributed to individuals for m edical reasons. The case, United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative, et al. , was decided by a unanim ous vote. Even though several states allow patients with a doctor's recomm endation to gr ow, possess, and use the drug for pain, the Suprem e Court reiterated that there is no curren tly accepted m edical use recognized by federal law. Since federal la w classifies m arijuana as an illegal substance and offers no medical exceptions, the court ruled that distribution of the drug is illegal. The ruling did not address or change existing state laws tha t allow the m edicina l use o f marijuana, however, it d oes mean that m arijuana m anufacturers and distributors m ay be prosecuted a t the f ederal level. Ea ch state will n eed to determine how this ruling im pacts their resp ective state laws. 3. Employee Reinstatement - Public Policy Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. United Mine Workers of America On Nove mber 2, 2001 the United States Suprem e Court decided the Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. Un ited Mine Workers of America case in which the petitioner asked the co urt to clarify when courts can overrule arbitrator s' decis ions when they are contrary to public policy consid erations. In this case, an arbitrator reinstated a coal company truck drive r to his saf ety-sensitive position on two s eparate occa sions f ollowing positiv e dru g tests f or marijuana, co ncluding tha t the em ployer did no t have \"jus t caus e\" to discharg e the em ployee. The court concluded that th e reinstatem ent of the em ployee was not contrary to public policy since the Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations leave disciplinary action up to the discretion of the em ployer. The re gulations state the c onditions under which an individu al who viola tes the rules (i. e., positiv e test resu lt) m ay be retu rned to saf ety- sensitive po sition s. Sin the co llective ba rgain ing agreem ent gran ted th e arbitra tor authority to interpret the m eaning of t heir contract's language, including such words as \"just cause\" and the em ployee was required to successf ully c omplete the return -to-duty process, the arbitrator did not act ou tside th e sco pe of his c ontractually delegated authority and did not violate any law or regulation. The arbitrator's aw ard is consistent with DOT rules requiring com pletion of substance abuse tr eatm ent before returning to work following a positive te st resu lt. 4. Dispatchers - Safety Sensitive Gonz alez v. Metropolitan Transportation Authority The California cas e, Gonzalez v. Metropolitan T ransportation Authority , was f iled in April 1996 on behalf of a radio dispatcher and instructor em ployed by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA). The distri ct court dism issed the com plaint, which ch alleng ed the grante e's policy, and the plaintiffs appealed. The Chapter 2. Regulatory Overview 2-26 August 2002 plain tiffs agreed th at their pos itions were not saf ety-sen sitive and consequently should not be subject to FTA drug or alcohol testing. On April 14, 1999, a unanim ous panel of the 9th Circu it revers ed and sent the case ba ck to the trial c ourt to revie w the design ation of disp atchers as s afety-sensitiv e workers. The appeals court stated, \"We do not know, from the record we h ave, whether the em ployees at issue would pose a substantial im mediate threat to public safe ty if im paired by drugs or alcohol, or whether the proce dure for testing them would be reasonably effective for finding out if they are im paired, or whether the tests as perform ed were an undue invasion of their privacy. Facts m ight be proved under th e com plaint that would entitle plaintiffs to relief.\" The em ployees challenging the tes ting have the burden of proving the case. Until th is matte r is u ltimately reso lved, FT A grantees, sub recipients, (and their cover ed contractors) must continue to im plem ent FTA's drug and alcohol testing regulations, includ ing th ose af fectin g dispatchers. 5. Random Testing - Federal Law Supercedes State Law O'Brien v. MBTA On Dece mber 4, 1998, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld a federal Dis trict Cour t decision that p ermitted the Massachus etts Bay Trans porta tion authority (MBTA) to conduct random drug and alc ohol testing of transi t police. In this case, O'Brien v. MBTA , two transit p olice officers cont ended that MBTA's drug testing program violated their rights under f ederal law and the Massachuset ts Declaration of Rights. The Court of Appeals con cluded that by accepting federal tran sit assis tance, Massachusetts officials must abide by the c onditions that Congress attached to them , one of which m andates random drug and alcohol tests for e mployees who perform safety- sensitive functions. The Court of Appeals stat ed that because the Ac t includes an express pre-em ption provision, contrary state law could not stand as an obstacle to the testing protocol. 6. Employee Reinstatement - ADA Discrimination Claim Wilson v. S EPTA and TWU Philadelphia Local 234 Wilson v. SE PTA and TWU Philadelphia Local 234 was f iled in f ederal District Cou rt in Philadelphia by a bus operator who was fired af ter twic e testing pos itive f or alcoh ol. He alleged that his firing was discrim ination under the Am ericans with Disabilities Act (ADA). SE PTA (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority ) moved to dism iss the com plaint, argu ing that the p laintiff was not a qualified individual with a disability at the tim e SEPTA discharged him . In a ruli ng dated January 26, 1999, the court declined to dism iss the com plaint. The court found that the em ployee met the definition of \"disabled\" for establishing a prima facie case of discrim ination under the ADA in co nnection with his discharg e from SEPTA. The ultim ate issue of whether the f iring was dis ability discrim ination is yet to be determ ined by the court. Chapter 2. Regulatory Overview 2-27 August 2002 Chapter 2. Regulatory Overview 2-28 August 2002 Because FTA has consistently held that th e determination to retain or discharge an employee for having tested positive is a loca l decision, this opinion is not viewed as establishing a conflict between the ADA a nd FTA's drug and alc ohol testing rule. 7. Unreasonable Searches and Seizures Claim Dwan, et al. v. MBTA Dwan, et al. v. MBTA , filed as a Memorandum of D ecision (civil Action No. 95-12430- 6AO) addressed the claim that the MBTA test ing program violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution that prohibi ts unreasonable searches and seizures. The plaintiff asserted that he did not occupy a sa fety-sensitive position. The court held that maintenance functions performed by the plaint iff (i.e., repairing and installing body panels and welding and repairing vehicle understructure) were consistent with the regulatory definition of a safety-sensitive position and thus, including the plaintiff in the random testing program does not violate the Fourth Amendment. Additionally, other requirements impo sed by the MBTA that exceed the FTA requirements but do not conflict or interfere with the requirements of the rule, were challenged. The court concluded that the diffe rences between the explicit requirements of the regulations and the MBTA program as adopted appear to be authorized in 49 CFR Part 653.11 and thus, the plaintiff's claim had no merit. Chapter 3 . PROGRAM FORM ULATI ON AND REVISION Following the initia l publica tion of the regulation in 1994, most transit em ployers worked aggressively to develop comprehensive drug and alcohol testing program s to address the regulatory requirem ents. Originally, im plementation of the program was phased in with the large system s required to im plem ent first (1995), and the sm all operators required to follow a year later (1996). The implem entation deadlines for all covered em ployers have long passed; all covered em ployers are now required to be in com pliance. New transit operations, contractors, or employers that are new to public transit are requir ed to b e in com pliance with th e regulations before they assum e any safety- sensitive responsibilitie s. These em ployers must either form ulate a program if none exists, or revam p an existing drug and alcohol testing program to m eet FTA requirem ents. Covered employers with existing FTA program s may also find that their program s require periodic fine-t uning, revision, or overhaul depending on the extent of changes in regulations, organizational structure, policy, collective bargaining agreements, and/or internal procedures. For those employers who are establishing new FTA-compliant drug and alcohol testing program s or those who are revam ping an existing program , the recomm ended first s tep is to id entify and assem ble key personnel who are responsible for developing and im plem enting the program . The early involvem ent of transit manage ment, employees, and labor organizations and their continued involvem ent throughout the im plem entation Chapter 3. Program Formulation 3-1 August 2002 process ensures that all critical concerns are addressed and im proves the chances for acceptance and support o f the new/revised program . The program should be presented in a positive, proactive m anner as the product of a visible, agency-wide effort. Section 1. TAS K TEAM Experience has shown that implementation of a new program or revision to an existing one is best achieved when a task team is for med and given responsibility for for mulating or revising the policy and implem enting the drug and alcohol program , with managem ent guidance and approval. The com position of the team will depend on the size of the organization. In m edium- to large-sized system s, representatives from each of the following disciplines should be included if possible: managem ent, legal, m edical personnel, operations, maintenance, and labor relations. The team in unionized system s should include one representative from each bargain ing un it, and at least one employee representative from the general work population. You may also wish to include representatives from your consortium /third party adm inistrator or service agents (e.g., MR O, SAP) if you have already obtained their services. In sm all system s with lim ited staf f, the team should include at le ast a driver and/or a maintenance em ployee. Sm all system s that are part of a city or county departm ent may also wish to include legal counsel and someone from the pers onnel departm ent. Program Manager. The trans it system 's drug and alcohol program manager (DAPM) should lead the team . The DAPM should be knowledgeable about the transit system 's operations, hum an resources, drug and alcohol program and regulatory requir ements. The DAPM will be u ltimately responsible for the formation, implementation, and day-to-day manage ment of the program . The DAPM needs sufficient autho rity to direct the program and m ust have easy access to senior manage ment, union representatives, and first-line wo rkers. Task Team Responsibilities. The prim ary resp onsibility of the ta sk tea m is to develop an action p lan for accom plishing the program 's goals and objectives, thereby ensuring the successful implem entation or revision of the program . The action plan should include: a list of necessary tasks, the assignm ent of individuals responsible for tasks, and a tim e schedule for com pletion. Other duties of the task team may inc lude: Helping res olve loc al policy issues ; Providing input into the developm ent or revision of the employer's drug and alcohol testing program policy; Establishing roles and responsibilities of individuals responsible for developing procedures for the transit system 's drug and alcohol testing program ; Identifying and evaluating potential service agents, testing pools, consortia, or other program s that may be bene ficial to the em ployer; Providing input into procurem ent of equipm ent and contract services for specim en collection, laboratory testing, MR O services, BATs, and SAP and/or consortia; Assisting in em ployee awareness and supervisor training; and Chapter 3. Program Formulation 3-2 August 2002 Assisting in the im plem entation and evaluation of the overall drug and alcohol testing program . Recommend ation Positive Approach Support for the drug and alcohol testing program should be embraced by top management and filtered down through the ranks of the transit system. The transit system management and board should recognize that the implementation of a comprehensive drug and alcohol program will be a gr eat benefit to their employ ees. A good program will imp rove public safety, employee safety, and employee morale. In addition, the program will deter prohibited drug use and alcohol misuse, and will provide a mechanis m to identify and help those employees with substance abuse problems. When presented in this positive manner, the program will have a gre ater like lihood of being accep ted with little oppositio n from the employees or union. Section 2. ACTION PLAN The actua l time that a system will need to form ulate or revise its program will vary depending on the local circum stances and current status of its substance abuse managem ent program . Addition al time may be required if your current substance abuse manage ment program is inconsistent with the FTA regulations or if labor/m anagement issues are unresolved. F igure 3-1 shows a suggested schedule for critical program formulation activ ities. N ew transit sy stem s or safety-s ensitiv e contractors should initiate their action plan well in advance of system /contract start-up, as each m ust have their com pliant program s in pla ce pr ior to the perform ance of safety-sensitiv e functions. Figure 3-2 shows a suggested schedule for critical program review activ ities. Chapter 3. Program Formulation 3-3 August 2002 Figure 3-1. Suggested Schedule for Crit ical P rogram Formulation A ctivities Chapter 3. Program Formulation 3-4 August 2002 Figure 3-2. Suggested Schedule for Cr itical P rogram Review Activities Chapter 3. Program Formulation 3-5 August 2002 Chapter 4 . PO LICY DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNICATION The FTA regulation req uires that ev ery covered em ployer including direct recipients, sub-recipients, and safety- sensitive contractors that have safety- sensitive em ployees develop a com pliant policy on prohibited drug use and alcohol misuse in the workplace. The rule also requires that the policy statem ent be written and m ade available to ev ery safety-sensitive em ployee. You should use this cha pter as a che cklist of the item s that should be includ ed in your policy. Only an employer can establish a policy for its em ployees. Therefore, contractor employees sh ould not be placed under an agency's policy. The agency, however, can dictate through its contract, the m inimum requirem ents of the contractor's policy and can require approval authority. Agen cies that co ntract out their saf ety-sensitive functions and have no safety-sensitive em ployees are not required to have a policy statem ent. Section 1. REQUI RED PO LICY STATEM ENT The em ployer's Drug and Alcohol Program Manager (DAPM) should guide the developm ent of the initial draft and any subsequent revisions. D epending on the structure of the agency, the DAPM may wish to solicit input from em ployees, labor organizations, other m anagem ent personnel, and service agents as described on page 2-1 of the Best Practices manual. FTA suggests that an em ployer's policy statem ent incorporate its position an d inform ation on all m ajor aspects of its drug and alcohol program . Part 655 specifies the minimum requirem ents that m ust be included to be considered com pliant. FTA acknowledges that policy statem ents are written for m any various target audiences, including em ploye es, unions, the legal system , etc. Therefore, Chapter 4. Policy Developm ent and Communication 4-1 August 2002 employers m ay expand and im prove upon the policy as appropria te to addres s these audiences. This is a cceptable as lon g as FTA's requirem ents are m et and the employer's provisions are noted accord ingly. Thus, system s with detailed policies m ay continue to use them , but volum inous policies are not required by FTA. The required elem ents of a policy are discussed in the following sections. Identify Co ntact Perso ns You m ust identify the person, office, branch, and/or position to answer employee questions about the drug and alcohol program , with the telephone number and office location clearly indicated. In m ost cases, the contact person will be the em ployer's DAPM. Employee Categories Subject to Testing Employees who perform safety- sensitive functions m ust be tested under the FTA regulation. Policies m ust identify the saf ety-sensitive functions tha t are covered and the em ployee's positions that are subject to testing. Most em ployers attach a list of func tions and position titles to avoid policy revision every tim e they make personnel changes (see Chapter 2, \" Regulatory Overview,\" f or safety-se nsitive definition ). Participation as a Requirement of Employment The policy should state that participation in the agency's prohibited substance testing program is a requirem ent of each safety- sensitive em ployee and, therefore, it is a condition of em ploym ent. Prohibited Behavior Employers must specify the em ployee behaviors that the FTA rules prohibit. The policy m ust also id entify the tim es when safety-sensitive em ployees m ust comply with the drug and alcohol rule. Use of illega l drugs is pr ohibited at all tim es. An e mployee m ust not consum e alcohol while perform ing a safety- sensitive function (\u00a7655.32). Performing a saf ety-sensitive function is defined as any tim e the employee is actually perform ing, ready to perform , or immediately available to perform such functions. Employees are prohibited from consum ing alcohol 4 hours prior to performing a saf ety-sensitive function (\u00a7655.33). Employees must not consum e alcohol for 8 hours following an acciden t unless the em ployee has already undergone a post-accident test (\u00a7655.34). Employees are also prohibited from consum ing alcohol during the hours the em ployee is on-call (\u00a7655.33(b)). Employees are prohibited from performing a saf ety-sensitive function while having an alcohol Chapter 4. Policy Developm ent and Communication 4-2 August 2002 concentration of 0.04 or greater (\u00a7655.31). Employees with an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04 m ay not be allowed to perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions until a subse quent te st measures less than 0.02, or the em ployee has been rem oved from duty for at least 8 hours. In addition, the policy may also incorporate policy la nguage required by the Drug-Free W orkplace Act (DFWA) of 1988 that requires direct recipients of $25,000 or more of fede ral funds to prohibit any em ployee fr om engaging in unlawfully m anufacturing, distributing, dispensing, possessing, or using controlled substances in the workplace. Som e employers have chosen to establish a single po licy that m eets the requ irements of the FTA drug and alcohol testing regulations and the DFWA. Others have chosen to m aintain two separate policy statem ents that address the requirements of the two ru les. Circumstan ces for Tes ting The FTA requires drug and alcohol testing for s afety-sens itive em ployees in specific circum stances: reasonable suspicion, post-accident, random , return to duty, and follow-up. Drug tests are required for pre-em ploym ent. Alcohol tests are p ermitted by Part 655, but are not required. If pre-em ploym ent alcohol tests are performed, the em ployer m ust com ply with the requirem ents in Part 655.42. A detailed discussion of each testing procedure is provided in Chapter 6, \"Types of Testing.\" Your policy must define these circum stanc es in suf ficient deta il to inf orm the safety -sensitiv e em ployee about what trigg ers the tests. Behavior That Constitutes a Test Refusal (Random, Reason able Suspicion, Post-Accident, Retu rn-to-Duty, Follow- Up) Behavior That Constitutes a Test Refusal Drug Test Alcohol Test Failure to appear for a test i n the time fra me specified by the em ployer. X X Failure to remain at the testing site until the testing process is co mpleted. X X Failure to provide a urine speci men, sal iva, or breath speci men, as applicable. X X Failure to provide a sufficient volum e of urine or breath without a vali d medical explanation f or the failure. X X Failure to un dergo a m edical exam ination to verif y insufficient volum e. X X Failure to cooperate with a ny part of the testing process. X X Failure to permit the observation o r monitoring of speci men donation when so required (\u00a740 .67(l) and \u00a740.69(g)) X X Failure to take a second test required b y the em ployer or collector. X X A drug test result that is verified by the MRO as adulterated or substituted. X Failure to sign the certification on Step 2 of the Alcohol Test Form . X Behavior that Constitutes a Test Refusal The policy must describe behavior that constitutes a refusal for both drug and alcohol tests [40.191,655.15( g)]. The chart above lists the behavior s that constitute a test ref usal for all tes ting catego ries e xcept for pre-em ploym ent. Chapter 4. Policy Developm ent and Communication 4-3 August 2002 Since applicants are not yet employees, the definition of a test refusal for a pre-em ploym ent test is lim ited by comparison since applicants m ay have legitim ate reasons for failing to appear. For exam ple, the individual m ay choose another job or decide they no longer want the position. In these situations, it w ould be unfair to qualify the failure to app ear as a test refusal with the subsequent consequences. In addition, there m ay be legitim ate circum stances where an applicant co uld leav e a collection s ite before the test actually comm ences. Consequently, an applicant refuses a pre-em ploym ent test only if he/she f ails to complete the tes t once the collectio n process has begun (i.e., acceptance of the collection container). If the applican t leaves the c ollection s ite prior to th e completion of the test, or takes another action listed above, the applicant has refused a test with corresponding DOT- mandated consequences. However, if the applic ant lea ves the s ite bef ore the te st begins or does not appear for the pre- employm ent test, the test is not refused and there are no DOT c onsequences. Additionally, with a pre-em ploym ent test that requires a medical exam ination for the Medical Review Officer (MRO) verification process or when required by the Designated Em ploye r Representative (DER), the employee is deem ed to have refused to test only if the m edical exam ination was conducted following a contingent offer of e mployment. Testing Pro cedures The policy must describe the testing procedures and explain that the procedures protect the employee an d the integrity of the drug and alcohol testing process, safeguard th e valid ity of the te st results, and ensure the tes t resu lts are attributed to the correct employee. To m eet this requirem ent, the policy statem ent needs only to reference th at the employer will ab ide by 4 9 CFR Part 40 as amended. It does not need to include detailed discussions of the testing procedures. By referencing this inform ation, your policy will be sho rter, les s cumbersom e, and easier to keep current. Employers must, however, ensure that the current version of Part 40 is available for review by employees when requested. Employers have taken different approaches to this requirem ent. W hile som e include Part 40 by reference only, others include g reater de tail in their po licy statem ent, or develop procedure handbooks that supp lement their p olicy (see th e Best Practic es manual). Any of these m ethods is acceptable as long as th e minimum requirem ents are add ressed. Consequences of Drug Use and the Misuse of A lcohol The policy must contain the consequences for a safety-sensitive employee who violates the rule. Violations occur when an em ployee: has a ver ified positiv e drug test result; has a confirm ed alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater; or refuses to su bmit to a tes t (see definition above). This includes the m andatory requirem ent that su ch a s afety-sens itive em ployee be removed i mmediately from his or her position, and be referred for evaluation by a substance abuse pr ofessional (SAP). Additionally, the polic y must specify the consequences for a covered em ployee who Chapter 4. Policy Developm ent and Communication 4-4 August 2002 Inclusion of Policy on P rescription and Over-the-C ounter Med ications has a confirm ed alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04. This includes the m andatory requirem ent that the individual be rem oved from safety- sensitive duties until the next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than 8 hours following the test, unless a retest measures less than 0.02. Although not addressed in the FTA drug and alcohol testi ng rules, the FTA encouraged all g rant recipients in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter to edu cate trans it operato rs about the risks of using prescription and over-the-counter m edications. Grantees were encouraged to include policy provisions regarding an employee's use of over-the counter and prescription medications that could jeopardize public safety. Any further action (e.g., suspension, termination) taken aga inst the em ployee is left up to the discretion of the em ployer, consistent w ith law. W hatever the employer authorized consequences m ay be, these actions m ust be clearly described in deta il in the policy. F or every prohibited behavior co vered in the p olicy, there should be a corresponding consequence. The policy should state that these additional actions are im posed under employer authority, and are not m andated by FTA. Section 2. ADDITI ONAL EMPLOYER PROVISIONS The policy statem ent m ay provide additional detail or include additional requirem ents not m andated by FTA, as long as those provisions are identified as being included under the em ployer's own authority. T he additi onal provisions must not contradict, discourage, or in any way confuse the m inimum FTA requirem ents. Section 2.2 of the Best Practices manual addresses som e of these additional provisions and provides exam ples of polic ies. Specifically, the policy should address medications that cause drowsiness, impair cognitive or m ental abilities. FTA recomm ends that s afety-s ensitive em ployees enter into a dialogue with their physician or pharm acist regarding the side effects of medications and inqui re about potential alternative tr eatm ents tha t will no t jeopardize the individual' s ability to perf orm job functions safely. The list is not definitive or all-inc lusive, but it is p rovided for general awareness. T he best source of additional infor mation on these or other prescriptions and over-the-counter medications is your MR O. There are several m ajor policy initiatives, however, that FTA and/or the DOT have identified for consideration when e mployers form ulate their policy statem ents. These policy initiatives are discussed in the following section. Chapter 4. Policy Developm ent and Communication 4-5 August 2002 Stand-Down Waivers Under the DOT rule, the prohibition of stand-downs is narrowly defined and associa ted w ith th e notif ication of the employer of a positive laboratory test result without MR O verification. This provision does not im pede an em ployer's policies that require the rem oval of e mployees from safety-sensitive duties for any other reason not specifically addre ssed in the regulation. The term \"stand-down\" refers to an employer practice of temporarily removing an em ployee fr om the performance of safety-se nsitive dutie s after le arnin g that the in dividua l had a confirmed laboratory po sitive drug te st, but before the MRO has com pleted the verification process. Removal from Duty Follow ing a Post- Accident or Reasonab le Suspicion Test Historically, stand-downs have been prohibited under the DOT regulation, and they continue to be so under the new rule. MROs are not perm itted to inf orm employers of a laborato ry positiv e test until the MR O has deter mined if there is a legitim ate medica l expla nation f or the test result and has verified the test as either positiv e or n egativ e. This prohibition is based on the prem ise that standing-down an em ployee before the MRO verification process is complete is prem ature, and could undercut the rationale for the MRO review. It could com promise confidentiality, and m ay unfairly stigm atize the em ployee as a drug us er. Some transit em ployers have established a policy under their own authority that requires em ployees be rem oved from safety- sensitive service pending drug and alcohol test results f ollowing accidents and reasonable suspicion determ inations. This practice is not considered a stand-down under the D OT rule, as the \"event\" was the reason for the person being rem oved from duty, not the laboratory test result. In this case, the employer has no knowledge of the drug test result, only that a drug test was required. T his practice is not prohibited by FTA, but is encouraged due to liability considerations. Recognizing, however, that som e employers advocate stand-downs to enhance saf ety and reduce liability, the new DOT rule (\u00a740.21) includes a mechanis m for e mployers, on a case-by- case bas is, to seek waiv ers if certain conditions are m et. Specifically, the employer must have a w ell-founded stand- down plan that effectively protects the interests of the em ployees including confidentia lity, and the f acts m ust represent a genuine and plausible safety concern. Removal of Employees From Duty While Awaiting Split Specimen Test Results Employers have also been confused by how the stand-down prohibition relates to the practice of re moving em ployees from duty following a non-negative test result (i.e., positive, adulte rated, substituted), while awaiting the split s pecim en test result. Once the M RO has completed the review process and verified a test as non-negative, the em ployer is required to imm ediately remove the em ployee f rom safety-se nsitive duties. The em ployee's rem oval cannot be delayed while awaiting the split specim en result. Thus, this is not a stand-down as defined in the DOT rule as the laboratory test resu lt has already been verified by the FTA anticip ates that f ew trans it employers will be ab le to m eet the string ent req uirements deline ated in the waiver request process, and therefore, no policy o r procedura l change will res ult. Chapter 4. Policy Developm ent and Communication 4-6 August 2002 MRO before the em ployer is notified of the te st result. Second Chance versus Z ero Tolerance Once the FTA m inimum consequences are m et for a non-negative test result, FTA holds no position on th e discip line th at employers establish for test refusals, positiv e test results, adu lterated or substituted specim ens. Som e employers practice zero-tolerance and discharg e any employee who has a non -negative tes t result. Others operate under a second chance policy that allows em ployees who viola ted the rule to re turn to a saf ety- sensitive po sition af ter successf ully completing the return-to-duty process. Still others establish some hybrid policies based on past practice, employer philosophy, and labor/managem ent agreem ents. Employers must reflect the em ployee consequences within the policy and clearly identify each as being provided under the employer's own authority. This decision has far reaching im plications and m ust be well thought out. There is no best or recomm ended disciplinary policy. Americans w ith Disabilit ies Act an d Drug-Free Workplace Act Provisions If you develop a policy that includes components of the Drug-Free W orkplace Act and the Am ericans with Disabilities Act (ADA), you should review Chapter 13, \"Drug-Free W orkplace Act of 1988,\" and Appendix C, \"Am with Disabilities Act Discussion.\" Section 3. PO LICY ADOPTI ON A final review of the draft policy and/or policy revisions should be conducted by your legal representative and by your labor relations or personnel officer. This lega l review is to en sure tha t there are no conflicts between the policy provisions, the FTA requirem ents, and other state and local laws. (Note: The F TA rule preempts contrary state and/or local laws.) The labor relations/personnel review should identify and resolve any conflicts between the policy and existing labor agreem ents or personnel policies. T he requirem ents of the FTA regulations are not subject to bargaining. You should allocate sufficient tim e for this review and approval, and you should notify your governing board in the early stages of the policy developm ent process that its app roval will be required. The local governing board of the employer must officially adopt the policy and any substantive revisions m ade thereto. The governing board of the em ployer m ay take m any form s depending on the organizational structure and legal form ation of the agency. A list of the m ost common governing boards is provided on the following page. Chapter 4. Policy Developm ent and Communication 4-7 August 2002 Organiz ation/Agency Governing Board Municipality City Council County County Comm issioners Regional Transit Authority Board of Trustees For-Profit C orporation Board Non-Profit Corporation Board Partnership Partners Sole Proprietor Owner In the event the em ployer has no governing board or the governing board does not have policy approval authority, the highest-ranking official with authority to approve the policy can do so. Section 4. PO LICY COMMUNICATION Once you have developed or revised your agency's polic y and it has been adopted, you m ust make sure that employees are aware of the policy an d subsequent changes, an d the ef fect it will have on them. You must provide materials (or notify em ployees of the availability of material) explain ing the regulations, the policy, and the corresponding procedures to each safety- sensitive em ployee and representatives of employee organizations (\u00a7655.16). A sample Program Notif ication letter th at satisfies this requirem ent is provided in the Sample Docum entation section of this chapter. Informing Current Employees o f Policy Requirements and Revisions How you communicate this inform ation to your covered em ployees is your choice and is not dictated by the regulation. You can use any or all of the mechanis ms available at your organization to educate your em ployees about the regulatory and em ployer policy requirem ents. The following m ethods have been used su ccessfully : Orientation sessions Written m aterials Interactive forum s Informational m aterial displays Ongoing dialogue am ong safety- sensitive em ployees, labor representatives, first-line supervisors, and m anage ment. FTA strongly encourages each em ployer to have each em ployee sign a \"Confirm ation of Receipt\" for m acknowledging receipt of the policy and the regulation summary. A sample for m is provided at the end of this section. If you brief em ployees as a group, you should have each employee sig n an attend ance r oster and m aintain the lis t in your records. Do not confuse the requirem ent to notify safety-sensitive em ployees about your Chapter 4. Policy Developm ent and Communication 4-8 August 2002 Labor Involvement policy with the requirement to form ally train certain em ployees and supervisors in selected aspects of your drug and alcohol program . See Chapter 5, \"Training,\" for an explanation of your training obliga tions. Implementation of the FTA- mandated drug and alcohol program is not subject to bargaining, unless the tr ansit agency chooses not to accept FTA operating or capital funding. Even then, the em ployer may fall under the regulatory authority of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Adm inistration (FMCSA). Only those policy provisions included under the em ployer's own author ity are subjec t to c ollective bargaining. You can include other item s in your policy orientation sessions. One suggestion is to provide an open forum where top managem ent, union officials, laboratory representa tives, and/or a substance abuse professional m ay answer questions regarding the policy, its implications, testing procedures, or available em ployee ass istance. Be su re that persons answering questions about the policy and regulations are com pletely knowledgeable concerning the program . Avoid generalities, vague answers, opinions, and guesses. If a specific issue is not resolved or addressed by the policy, say so. If you do not know the answer to a question, ass ure the audience that yo u will get an answ er as soon as possible, and be sure to follow-up. Union or employee leadership m ust be notified of the em ployer's anti-drug and alcohol m isuse policies and procedures and any subsequent changes m ade in the program . It can be advantageous to involve the union o r employee leadership in the policy formulation/revi sion process. Your employee representatives m ay actively support the drug and alcohol program and may offer to assist in the adm inistration of employee support program s (i.e., Alcoholics Anonym ous, Em ployee Assistance Program s). For a m ore detailed discussion of labor involvem ent practices, see Section 3.1 of the Best Practices manual. Manageme nt Commitment FTA suggests that top m anagem ent should demonstrate its personal comm itment and support of the program by communicating the policy to employees, which will s et an exam ple, and ensure fair and im partial im plementation. Managem ent assurances of strict confidentiality are k ey elem ents in prom oting the program . Senior transit officials should understand the program thoroughly and should know about the effects of substance abus e, the requirem ents of the regulation, and the prescr ibed d isciplinary actions. A po sitive attitude toward a dr ug- and alcohol-free work site should be communicated at every opportunity and will help to achieve a successful program . Applicants for Employ ment You m ust make sure that all safety- sensitive ap plican ts are fully aware of the transit system 's comm itment to a drug- and alcohol-free workplace. Add a statem ent similar to th e one belo w to all notices of safety-sensitive positions: The (Transit Agency) has established the goal of a 100 percent drug- and alcohol- free workplace. Applicants will be required to undergo drug testing prior to employment and will be s ubject to further drug and alcohol testing throughout their employment. Chapter 4. Policy Developm ent and Communication 4-9 August 2002 In addition, the em ployee application form should contain a statem ent in which the prospective em ployee agrees to follow the transit system 's drug and alcohol policy and subm it to drug and alcohol testing if performing a saf ety-sensitiv e function. Current em ployees who are transferring to a safe ty-sensitive function must also be m ade awar e of these policies. Further details on pre-employm ent testing are found in Chapter 6, \"Types of Testing.\" Contract Service Prov ider Notifica tion The rules require th at each recip ient cer tify that it c omplies with the ents of the regulations (\u00a7655.83). If a recip ient uses a contract service provider or m aintenance provider, these contractors must also be in com pliance, unless th ey are m ainten ance contractors who work for Section 5311 subrecipients or Section 5307 or 5309 recipients that serve populations under 200,000. Since the regulation covers contract personnel w ho are \"standing in the shoes of\" the tran sit sys tem safety-sen sitive employees, it is th e recip ient's responsibility to ensure that contract organizations com ply wi th the regulations. The safety-sensitive functions covered for contract personnel are the sam e, except for the exclusions noted. T hese em ployees may be full- or part-tim e workers of the contractor. Examples o f Covered Safety-Sens itive Contractors Contractor Function (Stands In the Shoes of FTA Section 530 7, 5309, or 5311 Recipients) Covered Not Covered Fixed Route Service X Demand Response/Par atransit X ADA Co mplementary Paratransit X Turn-Key Service Providers X Brokerage Se rvices\u2014 Broker/Dispa tcher Chooses Service Provider X Passenger Ch ooses Service Provider X Intercity Service Provider X Maintenance Service for Section 530 7 and 530 9 Recipients that Serve Populatio n Greater than 200,000 X Maintenance Service for Section 531 1 Subrecipients and Section 5 307 and 5309 Recipients that Serve Populations Less Than 200,000 X Warranty Work X Vehicle Manufacture/Remanufacture X Facility Cons truction Workers X Security Services (with Firear ms) for Vehicles, Bus Stops, Term inals X Security (with Firear ms) for Vehicle Stora ge, Buildings, and Grounds X Engine and C omponent Rebuilding a nd Overhaul X Chapter 4. Policy Developm ent and Communication 4-10 August 2002 Do not assum e that your contractors are knowledgeable about the regulatory requirem ents or that they have com pliant policies or program s. It is the FTA recipient's responsib ility to take the necessary actions to en sure the contractor's compliance. Inform contractors of the record keeping and reporting requirem ents and your intent to m onitor compliance. It is your responsib ility to oversee and ensure th at each contractor is com pliant. You m ust certif y tha t they are in complianc e and ensure that they h ave com pleted their annual MIS Reports and subm itted th em to FTA as appropriate (see Chapter 10). You should notify a ll contract service and covered m aintenance providers in writing of the regulatory requirem ents and the need f or them to comply with th e minimum requirem ents. Your procurem ent and contract docum ents should include specific language outlining the com pliance regula tions with the ag ency's regu latory compliance as a condition of contract award, and sta te tha t failure to remain com pliant will result in contract term ination. You m ay also wish to provide th em with the n ecessa ry tools and technical assistance needed to develop and m aintain a com pliant program , such as the f ollowing: Section 5. POLICY UPDATES Given the complexity of the regulation, diversity of the tran sit industry, regulatory emphasis on testing technology, and the illegal drug trade, all em ployers covered under the F TA regulation should anticipate that po licy modif ication s will be req uired. Employers should stay up to date with the requirem ents, FTA letters of interpretation, and DOT/FTA guidance. Policy changes should be made as appropriate. Provide each contractor with a copy of the regulatory requirem ents, these Implementation Guidelin es, other FTA publications and resources as appropriate, and the transit system 's policy statem ent, including a description of the program 's intent and im plications. Anytim e an em ployer makes substantive changes in the policy, it must be officially approved by the governing board and communicated to all employees. Th e date that the policy was last revised and approved should be clearly indica ted in the policy. Employers should review their policy at least once p er yea r to de termine if modifications are necessary. Have each contractor s ign a \"Confirm ation of Receipt\" form acknowledging receipt of the policy and the regulations. Invite the co ntrac tor to p articipa te in the transit sy stem 's testin g and training program . Provide the contract or with a lis t of consortia/third party administrators (C/TPA) tha t can prov ide the necessary services to ens ure that the contractor is in com pliance. Chapter 4.

Policy Development and Communication 4-17 August 2002 Sample Program Notification Letter\u2014New Policy/Program Dear (Safety-Sensitive Employee) or Union Representative) : The Federal Transit Administration has recently revised and consolidated its drug and alcohol regulations into one new regulation entitled, Prevention of Alcohol Misuse and Prohibited Drug Use in Transit Operations (49 CFR Part 655). (Transit Agency) is required to comply with this regulation, and we must issue a policy prohibiting illegal drug use at all times by our safety-sensitive employees. In addition, alcohol consumption by our safety-sensitiv e employees is prohibited while performing, and for 4 hours prior to performing safety-sensitive functions. Alcohol use after an accident is also prohibited. Tests must be conducted in six specific situations to determine whether an employee has used alcohol or drugs. The procedures and technology we will employ in this testing are specified in a Department of Transportation regulation, Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs (49 CFR Part 40). The regulations are very specific regarding what (Transit Agency) must do to comply. We have developed a policy and procedures list that will apply to you based upon the job functions you perform at (Transit Agency) . To help you and your representatives bette r understand our policy and procedures, the following information will be available at all times in the (Drug and Alcohol Program Manager's/General Manager's/Legal/Labor Relations/Human Resources/Medical) Office: 1.

If you have any questions regarding these regulations or (Transit Agency's) policy and procedures, please contact (Name of Contact Person) at (Telephone Number of Contact Person) . Sincerely, General Manager Enclosure(s) Chapter 5 . TRAINI NG The regulations do not require you to provide any educati on or training for non- safety-sensitive em ployees, nor do they require supervisory training for supervisors who will not be dete rmining when to administer a reasonab le suspicion test. Similarly, the regulations do not require refresher tra ining for safety-sen sitive employees. You are encouraged, however, to provid e addition al training beyon d the requirem ents of the regulation under your own authority. Training and educating your workforce and supervisors are m ajor com ponents of a successful drug and alcohol testing program . The benefits of the program are enhanced when your employees and supervisors understand your policies and procedures, why they are being im plem ented, and what their responsibilities are. Well-trained em ployees and supervisors help you achieve your safety goals and maintain program integrity, which reduces your program costs a nd liabilities, and improves company m orale. The FTA regulations require specific training for safety-sensitive em ployees and their supervisors. Section 1. TRAINI NG FOR SAFETY-SENSITIVE EMPLO YEES The FTA drug and alcohol testing regulation (\u00a7655.14) requires each covered employer to establish an education and training program for all covered em ployees. The program m ust include a general education component, training for all safety- sensitive em ployees, and training for all supervisors and/or other com pany officers The requirem ents with which you must comply are summ arized in this ch apter and corresponding sam ple course outlines are also provided in the Sam ple Docum entation section. Chapter 5. Training 5-1 August 2002 If you provide an Em ployee Assistance Program (EAP), the EAP should be able to provide you with information and educational m aterials. In fact, your contract may require the EAP to supply and distribute them . Also, your health insurance carrier or local government m ental health agencies m ay have educational m aterials available to distribut e to your workforce. authorized by the em ployer to m ake reasonable suspicion determ inations. Education The general educati on component of the program (\u00a7655.14(a)) requires each employer to display and distribute inform ational m aterial about the effects of drugs and alcohol to every covered employee. In addition, each em ployer m ust display and distribute a community service hot line telephone num ber (if available) to help em ployees who m ay be experiencing problem s with prohibited drug use or alcohol m isuse. Community service hot line telephone numbers are available through a number of sources (see Figure 5- 2). If you cannot locate a local num ber, there are seve ral national hot line num bers that you can provide to your em ployees. Many of these numbers are toll free. In most cases, these national organizations can direct your employees to local services, including servic es for those witho ut insur ance coverage. Appendix F of these guidelines includes inform ation about drug and alcohol use that you m ay wish to incorporate into your educational program and inform ational materials. S uggested other sources of inform ation are shown in Figure 5-1. 1. National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug I nformation (NCADI) , PO Box or ( 301) 468-2600.

Substance Abuse Aw areness Training The regulation (\u00a7655.14(b)) requires that you provide a m inimum of 60 m inutes of training to all saf ety-sensitive em ployees on the effects and consequences of prohibited drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environm ent. This training m ust also address the signs and symptom s that m ay indicate drug use (\u00a7655.14(b)). Training safety-sensitive em ployees on the effects and consequences of alcohol misuse is not required by the FTA regulation. However, infor mation concerning the effects of alcohol m isuse on the individual's health, work, and personal life, as well as signs and sym ptoms of an alcohol problem , must be provided as part of the general education program as discussed previously (\u00a7654.14(a)). Typically, training is provided in a classroom setting with an instructor present to answer questions and f acilita te discussions. Som e employers use interactive technologies that do not require a live instructor. Cons ult Section 3.2 of the Best Practices manual for additional inform ation regarding training practices and instructional aides. Chapter 5. Training 5-3 August 2002 The 60 m inutes of awareness training is required only once in the em ployee's tenure with the company. One hour of training should be considered a minim um. The tim e may be exceeded if necessary. Because of the volum e of infor mation that m ust be covered, som e transit agencies have found 2 to 3 hours to be m ore appropriate. Depending on the em ployee- manage ment relationship and the unique needs of the em ployer's workforce, the employer may also choose to exceed the minimum requirem ent by providing refresher training. If an em ployer does so, the em ployer m ust specify that the additional requirem ents are set forth under the em ployer's authority and not the FTA. For system s establishing new drug and alcohol testing program s, the em ployee training should occur before the tim e of program inception. For system s that have program s established and have already conducted their initial employee training, no additional training is required, ex cept for new hires or transf ers into saf ety-sen sitive position s. However, m any system s have found it beneficial to provide em ployee New hires should receive copies of your drug and alcohol program notification, policy, and education materials. In most cases, th e 60 minutes of train ing are incorporated into th e employee orientation. Section 2. TRAINI NG FOR SUPERVISORS You m ust provide additional training for supervisors or other company officials who are au thorized to determine when it is appropriate to adm inister reasonable suspicion drug and/or alcohol tests. Supervisors play a critical role in administering the program policies; and they are responsible for m aintaining safety and productivity. Supervisors m ust determ ine when an employee's speech, behavior, body odor, or appearance provides \"reasonable suspicion\" that the em ployee has used or consum ed prohibited drugs or alcohol in violation of the FTA regulation. A reasonable suspicion determ ination requires that a drug and/or alcohol test m ust be administered. Only one supervisor's opinion is necessary to require a reasonable suspicion test, so it is importa nt that you provide adequate tra ining to d etermine when a tes t is needed. Employers who wish to have m ore than one supervisor involved in the decision- making process m ay do s o as long as those involved have received the requisite training and have drawn their conclusion based on their own observations. briefings in response to major regulatory or policy changes. Chapter 5. Training 5-4 August 2002 Supervisor training m ust include 60 minutes of training on the physical, behavioral, and performance indicators of probable drug use, and at least 60 m inutes of training on the physical , behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of probable alcohol m isuse. Therefore, a total of 120 minutes is required. Before m aking any reasonable suspicion determ inations, supervisors and other company officials are required to com plete the necessary training. The training is only re quired once an d there is no regulatory requirem ent for refr esher training. These requirem ents should be considered m inimums. Under their own authority, employers are allowed to exceed these requirem ents, and they m ay require training th at exceeds 2 h ours in length and/or require periodi c refresher training. Training Agenda See Exhibit 5-3 in the Sample Docum entation section of this chapter for a proposed agenda on supervisory training. The agenda com plies with the regulations and assum es that the alcohol and drug program training will b e conducted concurrently. Training elem ents that are not specifically required by the regulations are marked as optional. To im prove effectiveness, your training program may be expand ed to in trodu ce the purpose of the regulation and to review the testing requirem ents and the disciplinary procedures adopted by your agency. In addition, you m ay include a discussion of confrontation and docum entation procedures, and rehabilitation and treatm ent options, if they exis t. Your supervisors should understand all of these topics to administer the program effectively. To help you prepare your training sessions, Appendix F of these guidelines contains descriptions of the effects and behavioral indicator s of alcohol and prohibited substances. Record Keeping Requirements You m ust maintain detailed records of both your employee and supervisory drug and alcohol training fo r 2 years (\u00a7655.71). You m ust keep copies of all your training materials including attendance rosters, dates and tim es of training, and certifications of training com pliance. Your drug and alc ohol training records should be stored either with your other training records or in the agency's drug and alcohol testing program files. Section 3. PRESCRIPTION AND OVER-THE-COUNTER DRUGS The FTA drug and alcohol testing regulations do not address the use of prescription and over-the-counter (O TC) medications. However, on May 22, 2000, the FTA iss ued a \"Dear Colleague\" letter to all grant recipients encou raging them to educate transit operato rs about the risks associated w ith th eir use. Specifically, grantees are encourag ed to: 1) review curren t polic ies with re gard to operator's use of over-the-counter and prescription Chapter 5. Training 5-5 August 2002 medications which could result in public safety being jeopardized; and 2) immediately institute educational program s that address the potential dangers of taking certain types of m edications. The educational program s should address m edications that cause drowsiness or could im pair the operator's cognitive or mental abilities. As pa rt of the educational program , encourage safety-sensitive employees to enter into a dialogu e with th eir physician or pharm acist regarding the side effects of medications and to inquire into potential a lternative trea tments that will not jeopardize safe job perform ance. The best source of inform ation on prescription and over-the-counter medications is your MR O. Section 4. SOURCES OF TRAINING Training is available from m any sources . Some transit system s conduct substance abuse training in-house, while others contract with extern al trainers for th e service. Th e approach y ou choose will depend upon the training resources available within your com pany, both in term s of staff time and expertise. Som e of the external sources you m ay consider in selecting someone to develop or deliver your alcohol misuse and prohibited drug training are listed in Figure 5-3. You m ay choose to use company st aff for so me training and outside experts for other training. 1. Your EAP provider 2. Mental health professionals 3. Drug and alcohol treatm ent specialists 4. Pharm acists 5. Toxicologists 6. Nurses and physicians 7. Consultants specia lizing in the field of substance ab use in th e workplace 8. Local law enforcem ent drug awareness s pecialis ts 9. Your state alcohol and drug clearinghouse which m ay maintain a speaker's bu reau or list of consultants 10. Nonprofit organizations in your state 11. National organizations and their local affiliates such as the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence and the Em ployee Assis tance Professionals Association and their state and/o r local chapters 12. Larger transit system s near you that provide training to their em ployees and supervisors Figure 5-3. External Sources of T rainers Chapter 5. Training 5-6 August 2002 Whom ever you select to provide your training, you should ensure that the instructor will adhere to your outline and provide the training supportive of your policy and program s. Although a trainer may have an off-the-shelf curricu lum, that curriculum will be of little us e if it does not meet the requirem ents of the regulations or of your system . At a m inimum, the curriculum will need to be tailored to ref lect the provisions of your policy and procedures, your discipline policy, and your EAP, if any. For this reason, you m ay want to have som eone from your hum an resources, medical, or labor relations departm ent work with the outside expert in developing and presenting the training sessions. Important cr iteria to con sider in selec ting a tr ainer are : Workplace experien ce with trans it or similar indu stries; Concern with safety, cost reduction, productivity, liability, and public image, as well as em ployee welfare; Understanding of the applicable FT A and DOT regulations and how to handle em ployee attitud es and concerns regarding drug and alcohol testing; Training style, platform skills, techniques, tools, and m ethods appropriate to adult learning, including appropriate and high- quality audio/visual m aterial, handouts, role playing, and case studies; Willingness to learn abo ut your transit system, its operations, policy, program s, values, and culture; and Flexibility, professionalism , and tact in handling diverse opinions and needs of resistant em ployees, assertive m anagers, supervisors, executives, and union representatives. FTA sponsored the production of a training a id for transit su perviso rs that describes the signs and sym ptoms of prohibited drug use. This training program , entitled \" Identification of Drug Abuse and/or Alcohol Misuse in the Workplace: An Interactive Training Program ,\" demonstrates the m anifestation and behavioral cues of drug use and alcohol misuse, and the procedures supervisors should use to m ake fair and reliable reasonable suspicion te sting referrals. A copy of this training program including video and leader's guide can be obtained by faxing a request to the F TA Office of Safety and Security at (202) 366-7951. Section 5. DRUG- FREE WORKPLACE ACT TRAI NING Provisions of the FTA regulation affect only cover ed saf ety-sen sitive em ployees. You are not required to test or to train any employees who are not safety-sensitive. However, the Drug-Free Workplace Act (DFW A) requires that a ll direct recipients of $25,000 or more in federal funds ins titute an ongoing substance abuse awareness program . The act requires that efforts be made to ensure that the drug-free m essage is ever present in the workp lace, and it extends to all em ployees of a covered organization not just those who are deem ed safety- sensitive. For this reason, you m ay wish to train your entire workforce on the im portance of maintaining a drug-free workplace, and on the resources that you have available to help Chapter 5. Training 5-7 August 2002 employees who have problem s with prohibited drugs. Of course, you must m ake clear which parts of your policy and testing program apply to em ployees who are covered under the FTA drug and alcohol testing regulation and w hich parts apply to those who are not. Given the DFW A requirem ent for the establishm ent of an \"ongoing\" substance abuse awareness program, you m ay also wish to retrain em ployees and supervisors on a regular basis. In addition, if your system has regular safety m eetings, you m ay wish to include discussions of substance abuse to keep the issue in your em ployees' minds. Section 6. SERVICE AG ENT TRAINING REQ UIREMENTS You m ust ensure tha t the servic e age nts who provide the testi ng services for your agency are appropria tely educated an d trained. This includes urine specim en collectors, b reath alcoho l techn icians (BAT), screen tes t technicians (STT), Medical Review Officers (MRO), and Substance Abuse Professionals (SAP).

Questions and Answers Chapter 5. Training 5-20 August 2002 Exhibit 5-4 REASONABLE S USPICION TRAINING POINTS OF EMPHASIS Remember that the Primary Issue is Safety. Employees who are believed to be under the influence of a prohibited substa nce are an imm ediate hazard to them selves and others. Managem ent's in ability to substantia te the obj ective f acts asso ciated with the reason able suspicion determ ination or concern for a grieva nce or other employee action should be secondary to assuring safety. Inquire and Observe. Ask the em ployee to exp lain the su spected behavior and to describe the events that took place from his or her perspective. A persuasi ve explanation should not deter or prevent you from requiring a te st if you have a reasonable be lief that prohibited drug use or alcohol m isuse is a factor. Denial shou ld be an expected reactio n. If an em ployee knows he/she will test positive, he/she m ay give several explanati ons and protests in an attempt to avoid testing. As a result, a reasonable suspicion decision m ust be based on ob jective observations. R emember, a request for a urine sp ecim en or a breath te st is no t an accu sation; it is m erely a request for addition al objective data. To the em ployee, a requ est for a specim en m ay feel like an accusation; so it is im portant to stress that this is m erely a reque st for additional data. Explain also that the incident and the test results will be handled with st rict confidentia lity. Som etimes, it may be necessary to calm the situation by telling the employee, \"I'm glad to hear your explanation, and in light of the circum stances, I want to verify what you have just told m e.\" Isolate and Inform the Employee. Remove the em ployee fr om the vehicle or public locations. E xplain that you believe he/she m ay not be fit for duty and you are requesting him or her to accompany you to the collection site. Inf orm the e mployee of the consequences of refusal and that he or she is being relieved from duty. It is im portant to r espect the dign ity and conf identiality of the em ployee during th e interview. Review Findings. During the conversation, observe physic al and m ental sym ptoms. Be sure to docum ent any characteristics that either support or contradict the initial inform ation. The FTA regulation only requires that one superviso r make the reason able su spicion referra l. If possible, a second supervisor should be consulted. The conf irmation by a second supervisor creates greater objectivity, provides ad dition al obs ervation, an d generally s trengthens the reliability of the reasonable suspicion determ ination. Make the Reasonable Suspicion Decision. Anonym ous tips must be taken seriously, but should not be the sole reason to in itiate a request for a reasonable suspicion test. Hearsay is not an accep table basis for a reasonab le suspicion refe rral. If witnesses saw a specific ev ent or behavior, the supervisor should ask them to desc ribe what they saw. Questions a supervisor might ask an em ployee are: How far away were they? How long did they observe the person? Chapter 5. Training 5-21 August 2002 Chapter 5. Training 5-22 August 2002 What, if anything, caused them to believe it was substance-abuse-related behavior? On what basis did they reach their conclusions? The supervisor should observe the employee. What can the supervisor observe and objectively document as it relates to physical si gns and symptoms, emotional state, physical evidence, and related facts? The reasonable susp icion determination must be made based on the trained supervisor's observations. Transport the Employee. Although the FTA regulations do not specify that the employee must be transported, it is unwise to allow an employee suspected of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs to proceed alone to the collection site or to drive home. He or she could be a danger to self or others. In a ddition, the employer's exposure to li ability is great if damage or injury occurs. Accompanying the employee to the collection site also assures that there is no opportunity en route for the employ ee to ingest or acquire anythi ng that could affect the test result. The direct or immediate supervisor of the employee must not serve as the collection site person for drug or alcohol tests (\u00a7655.53). Document Events. Record the behavioral signs and symptoms that support the determination to conduct a reasonable suspicion test, and maintain those records for a minimum of 2 years. The signs and symptoms to look for are more fully described in Appendix F. Chapter 6. TYPES OF TESTING Six types of testing are required by Subpart E (49 CFR Part 655) of the FTA drug and alcohol rule. The six categories include: Pre-em ploym ent (drug test only) Reasonable suspicion Post-acciden t Random Return- to-duty Follow-up In addition to these six types of testing, transit system s with over 2,000 covered safety-sens itive em ployees are also required to perform blind sam ple testing as a quality assurance measure for th e testing lab oratory (\u00a740.103). Section 1. PRE-EM PLOYM ENT TES TING The purpose of pre-em ploym ent testing is to identify applicants who have exhibited high risk behavior (i.e., consum ed a prohibited d rug) in th e recent past. This behavior can im pact the workplace and presents an unacceptable safety risk to the employee, coworkers, passengers, and the general public. Pre-em ploym ent testing identifies those em ployees who could bring a substance abuse probl em into your transit agency. Pre-emp loyment Drug Testing The FTA regulation (\u00a7655.41) requires that a ll app licants f or employm ent in saf ety- sensitive po sition s or in dividua ls being transf erred into saf ety-sensitive positions from non-safety-sensitive positions must be given a pre-em ploym ent drug test. Applicants m ay not be assigned safety- sensitive functions unless the individual has a verified negative test result. When an existing cov ered em ployee has not performed a safety-sensitive function for 90 consecutive calendar days and the employee has not been in the em ployer's random testing pool during that tim e, the employee is required to take a pre- employm ent drug test and obtain a negative test resu lt prior to the r eassignm ent of safety-sensitive duties. The reason f or the Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-1 August 2002 Prior to conducting a pre-em ploym ent test, the em ployer m ust infor m the applicant or em ployee in writing of the testing requirem ent (\u00a7655.17). If a pre-em ploym ent drug test is cancelled, the em ployer shall require the employee or applicant to subm it to and pass another test. Figure 6-2 illustrates th e drug tes ting program for a pre - employm ent test. 90-day absence is not a consideration. Thus, employees that are off duty for sickn ess, vacation, jury duty, leav es of absence, worker's compensation, Fa mily Medical Leave, or any other purpose that extends 90 days or m ore will be sub ject to the p re- employm ent test if the employee has been removed from the testing pool. Employers should rem ove covered employees from the random testing pool for any testing period (i.e., quarter, m onth, week) for which the employer knows the em ployee will not perform any saf ety-sens itive du ties. Pre-emp loyment Alcoh ol Testing Pre-em ploym ent alcohol testing is not required, but an em ployer m ay choos e under FTA authority to conduct pre-em ploym ent alcohol testing followi ng the procedures set forth in Part 655.42 and Part 40 (Subparts J through N). If the em ployer chooses to conduct pre-em ploym ent alcohol testing, the applicant must have a negative alcohol test (<0.02 BAC) before the individual is assigned safety-sensitive duties. The employer can conduct a pre-em ploym ent alcohol test only afte r making a contingent offer of e mploym ent (or transf er) requiring a negative alcohol test result. The decision to conduct pre-em ploym ent alcohol tests m ust be consistent and reflect equal treatment for all covered employees. For example: If an employee is on extended wor ker's compensatio n leave for a n antic ipate d period of 6 months, the employee m ay be removed from the employer's random pool for the duration of the six months (i.e., six monthly testing periods) to avoid dilution of the pool. Since the 6-month period is longer than 90 days, the employee w ould be requ ired to take a pre-employment drug test prior to reassignment of safety -sensitive duties at the end of the 6-month period. On the other hand, if an individual has called in sick and the duration of the illness is un known, but it is like ly that the individual w ill return to work within the quarterly testing peri od, the individual should not be removed from the testing pool. If the illn ess exten ds past 90 d ays, the employee would not receive a pr e- employment test b ecause they remain ed in the employer's testing pool. Similarly, any applicant who undergoes a pre-em ploym ent test, but is not actually assigned safety-sensitive duties within 90 days from the date of the test, will have to be retested with negative test resu lts prior to the applican t's first performance of safety- sensitive duties. Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-2 August 2002 1. Alcohol test results of 0.04 alcohol concentration or greater; Previous DOT Employer Record Check Section 40.25 of the revised DOT drug and alcohol testing rule states that all DOT covered em ployers m ust make a good faith effort to obtain drug and alcohol testing records for the previous two years for all applic ants s eeking saf ety-sensitiv e position s. All DOT covered em ployers include those employers who fall under the regulatory authority of FTA, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Adm inistration (F MCSA), Federal Aviation Adm inistration (FAA), Federal Railroad Adm inistration (FRA), U. S. Coast Guard (USCG), and pipeline safety (RSPA). 2. Verif ied pos itive drug tests; 3. Refusals to test; 4. Other violations of FTA/DOT r ules; and 5. As appropriate, docum entation of the successful com pletion of DOT return-to-duty requirem ents including follow-up te sts. If the previous em ployer does not have this inform ation, this docum entation m ust be obtained from the employee. Employers that fall under the FTA author ity must adher e to the f ollowin g requirem ents: Require each applicant or employee transfers for s afety- sensitive po sition s to co mplete a written cons ent tha t allows their previous em ployers to release drug and alcohol testing inform ation to you. A sample form is provided in the S ample Docum entation section of this chapter. If the applic ant/tr ansferee ref uses to provide this written consent, you must not perm it him/her to perform safety-sensitive functions. If possible, obtain and review this inf ormation bef ore the employee perform s safet y- sensitive functions. If this is not possible, you m ust make and docum ent a good faith effort to obtain the infor mation. If you have not m ade a good faith effort, you must not allow the employee to perform safety- sensitive functions after 30 days from the date on which the employee first perform ed safety- sensitive job duties. You m ust also ask all applicants /transferees w hether he/she has tested positive, or refused to te st within the past 2 years on any DOT pre- employm ent drug or alcohol test administered by a DOT-covered employer for which they did not get the job. Subm it the applican t/tran sferee's written consent along with a request for infor mation to each of the DOT-regulated em ployers who have employed the applicant/transferee for any period during the 2 years before the date of the individual's application or transfer. The following infor mation must be obtained: Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-3 August 2002 If infor mation obtained from a previous em ployer includes any drug or alcohol test inform ation that indicates a non-negative test result or violation of the DOT/FTA r egulations, you m ust not allow th e em ployee to perform safety-sensitive duties unless you have obtained docum entation that the employee has com plied with the re turn- to- duty requirem ents including SAP assessm ent, successful treatm ent, negative return-to-duty test, and follow-up sts. All inf ormation rec eived and docum entation of good faith efforts m ust be kept as a confidentia l record and maintained for a m inimum of 3 years. Likewise, if you are requested to provide inform ation regarding a previous em ployee and the em ployee has provided written consent, you are required to provide the requested infor mation. The inform ation must be released in a co nfidentia l manner and you m ust maintain a written record of the inform ation released. Hiring Follow ing a DOT Rule Violation The FTA regulations prohibit you from assigning an individu al to a saf ety-sensitive position who has previously violated any DOT drug and alcohol regulations, unless that person has succes sfully com pleted the DOT return-to-duty process and has a negative pre-em ploym ent test. You m ay becom e aware of a violation by an applicant or existing employee through a self confession, previous em ployer record check, previous pre-em ploym ent test, or other means. The return -to-duty process includes the referral to a SAP for evaluation and completion of the recomm ended treatm ent program . Before assigning the individual to safety-sensitive duties, you m ust accept responsibility for th e completion of the recomm ended follow-up testing plan, if applicable. Also, you may require the applic ant to adhere to an y afterca re treatment recommendations. SAP Referrals for Pre-employmen t Non- Negative Test Results The DOT regulations require that all covered em ployees as w ell as applicants who violate a DOT drug and alcohol regulation (i.e., posit ive test resu lt or refusal) m ust be provided a list of Substance Abuse Professionals that are readily available to the em ployee/applican t. See Chapter 9 of these Guide lines f or more inform ation regarding the roles and responsibilities of the S AP. Pre-emp loyment Tests With Insufficien t Volume If an applicant is unable to provide a sufficient amount of urine to perm it a drug test (i.e., 45 mL) the collector m ust follow Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-4 August 2002 the \"in sufficient vo lume\" procedu res defined in \u00a740.193, and later described in Chapter 7. If, when foll owing these procedures, the applican t is still una ble to provide a sufficient specim en, the employer must direct the applicant to obtain an evaluation from a licensed physician within 5 days. The physician must be acceptable to the MRO and have expertise in the relevant medical field. The physician m ust ascertain if there is a m edical condition that w ith a high degree of probab ility, precluded the applicant from providing a sufficient am ount of urine. Addition ally, th e physician must determ ine if the applican t's m edical condition is the resu lt of a serious, perm anent, or long-term disability. If so, the MRO or evaluating physician m ust determ ine if there is c linical ev idence of illicit drug use. The MRO/physician m ay conduct an alternative test (e.g., blood test) as part of the m edical evaluation. If there is no evidence of illega l drug use, the MRO must report the test result as negative, thereby allo wing the ap plican t to be assigned safety-sensitive duties. The employer must m ake the applicant a conditional offer of e mploym ent before the medical evaluation, consistent with provisions of the Am ericans with Disabilities Act. Pre-emp loyment Test Refusals An applicant is considered to have refused a test only if the donor has comm itted to the proc ess and the co llection has comm enced (i. e., the applicant accepts the collection cup), and then fails to cooperate with or com plete the collection process as defined in \u00a740.191 and further described in Chapter 7. If the applicant does not appear at all for the pre-em ploym ent test, leave s the collectio n site, o r fails to cooperate before the test commences, he/she has not refused a test because the test has not yet com menced. Section 2. REASONABLE SUSPICION TESTING The FTA regulations (\u00a7655.43) require a safety-sensitive em ployee to subm it to a test when the employer has reasonable suspicion that the em ployee has used a prohibited drug or has m isused alcohol. The request to undergo a reasonable susp icion test must be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulab le observations concern ing the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odor of the safety-sensitive employee. Reasonable suspici on testing provides manage ment with a tool to identify affected employees who m ay pose a danger to them selves and others in their perform ance of safety-se nsitive functions. Em ployees may be at work in a condition that raises concern regarding their safety or productivity. A supervisor or other company official m ust determ ine if reasonable suspicion exists to conclude that substance abuse or alcohol m isuse may be causing the behavior. Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-5 August 2002 Any supervisors or other com pany officials who m ay be called upon to m ake this determ ination, m ust be trained in the facts, circum stances, physical evidence, physical signs and sym ptoms, or patterns of perform ance and/or behavior that are associated w ith use. Sup erviso rs must also know the proper procedures for confronting and referring the em ployee for testing. If supervisors or other company officials are not trained, or are not fair and ob jective in requesting reasonable suspicion tests, employee complaints of harassm ent m ay result. Be careful not to expect that training alone will make your supervisors experts in detecting substance abuse. Even with training, the overt signs and sym ptoms of substance abuse can often be m asked and may be subtle enough to avoid direct detection. T raining is described in more detail in Chapter 5, \"T raining.\" If one supervisor or other com pany official, trained to identify the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use, reasonably concludes that objective f acts may indicate drug use or alcohol m isuse, this is sufficient justif ication for testing. A final practical check is whether th e supervisor would have been less responsible in not taking action than in asking the employee to subm it to testing. Rem ember, safety is the f irst pr iority. The supervisor's decision should pass the \"reasonable prudent individual\" test, which sim ply means a sim ilarly tra ined and experienced supervisor, being reasonable and prudent and havi ng observed and noted the sam e facts, signs, an d circum stances could have reached th e sam e conclusion. Hunches and \"gut feelin gs\" are no t valid in making a reasonable suspicion determ ination. A reasonable suspicion referral m ust be based on a trained supervisor's specific, contem poraneous, articulab le observations concern ing the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odor of the covered em ployee. Reasonable suspicion referrals m ay be triggered by incidents and com plaints by other em ployees or passengers during the workday. In this situation, the supervisor must investigate th e claim s and m ake the reasonab le suspici on decision based on his/her own observations, not hearsay. It is imperative that reasonable suspicion decisions be m ade quickly and correctly based on the objective facts th at are p resent at the tim e of the observation. Only one trained supervisor or com pany official is required to m ake a reasonable suspicion determ ination. However, the pream ble to the regu lation clarifies th at employers are perm itted to requ ire two or more supervisors to m ake referrals as long as each is trained and each m akes the direct observation leading to the reason able suspicion d etermination. A reasonable suspicion test for drugs can be conducted anytim e a covered em ployee is on duty. Employers sh ould clearly define Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-6 August 2002 An accident (\u00a7655.4) is d efined as an occurrence associated with the operation of a vehicle in which: for employees what is m eant by on-duty (e.g., report tim e, clock tim e, etc.). However, a reasonable suspicion test for alcohol can only be conducted when the observations are m ade during, just preced ing, o r just after the perform ance of safety-sensitive functions. If a reasonable suspicion alcohol test is not conducted within 2 hours following the observations that led to the determ ination, the em ployer must document the reason for the delay. If an alcohol test is not administered within 8 hours following the determ ination, the employer must ceas e attem pts to adm inister the test and docum ent the reasons for the delay that resulted in the cessation of the test. An individual dies; An individual suffers a bodily injury and imm ediately receives m edical treatm ent away from the scene of an acciden t; The m ass transit vehicle involved is a bus, electric bus, van, or autom obile in which one or m ore vehicles incurs disabling dam age as the resu lt of the occu rrence and is transpo rted away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle; or Figures 6-3 and 6-5 at the end of chapte r, illu strate the rea sonable susp icion testing processes for alcohol and drugs. The m ass transit vehicle involved is a railcar, trolley car, trolley bus (on a fixed guideway or overhead wire), or vessel, and is rem oved fr om operation. This definition does not include rubber-tire look-alike historical trolley buses that operate on surface roads withou t a fixed guideway. These vehicles are considered buses under the previous definition. Section 3. POST-ACCIDENT TES TING The FTA regulations (\u00a7655.44) require testing for prohibited drugs and alcohol in the cas e of certain transit acciden ts or inciden ts that meet the FTA def inition. There is a significant d ifference between reasonable suspicion testing and post- acciden t testing. Reason able susp icion requires som e indication of probable linkage between behavior or events and substance abuse before a test can be requested. Post- acciden t testing is m andatory for accidents where there is loss of life associated with the operation of a revenue service vehicle. Post- acciden t tests are required for other n onfatal acciden ts unless em ployee perform ance can be discounted com pletely as a contributing factor. Damage that preclud es the departure of any vehicle from the scene of the occurrence in its usual m anner in daylight hours after simple repairs is known as \"disabling damage.\" Disabling dam age includes damage to vehicles that could have been operated, but would have caused further damaged if s o operated. Disabling dam age does not include damage that could be rem edied te mporarily at the scene of th e occurrence withou t special tools or parts, tire disablem ent without other dam age even if no spare tire is available, or dam age to headlights, taillights, Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-7 August 2002 Fatal Accid ent turn signals, horn, or windshield wipers that makes the m inoperative. Whenever there is a los s of hum an life, each surv iving safety-se nsitive em ployee operating th e mass transit veh icle at the tim e of the accident m ust be tested. Safety- sensitive em ployees not on the vehicle (e.g., maintenance personnel), whose perform ance could have contributed to the accident (as determ ined by the transit agency us ing the best inf ormation ava ilable at th e tim e of the acciden t), must also b e tested. Vehicles co vered in clude a bus, electric bus, van, autom obile, rail car, trolley car, trolley bus, or vessel that is used for m ass transpo rtation or f or ercial m otor vehicles and vehicles used by arm ed security personnel. Thus, accidents involv ing superviso r or general m anager vehicles that are not used to transport passengers do not m eet this definition and do not justify a post-accident test under this regulation. Post-accident drug and alcohol testing of the operator is not required under the FTA regulations if the covered em ployee is tested under the fatal accident testing requirem ents of the Feder al Moto r Carrier Safety Adm inistration rule (49 CFR Part 389.303(a)(1) or (b)(1)) by a law enforcem ent officer. An \"occurrence associated with the operation of a vehicle\" means that the acciden t or incident m ust be directly related to the m anner in which the drive r applies the brake, accelerates, or s teers the v ehicle. Operation of a vehicle does not include operation of the lift. An acciden t could be the resu lt of a collision w ith ano ther v ehicle or pedestrian, or it could be associated with an incid ent that occu rs on the vehicle without any contact with another vehicle (e.g., a passenger on the bus falls due to the manner in which the v ehicle was op erated ). Nonfatal Accident Following nonfatal accidents, em ployers shall tes t each saf ety-sen sitive em ployee operating th e mass transit veh icle at the tim e of the accident unless the em ployer determ ines that the covered em ployee's perform ance can be completely discounted as a contribu ting facto r to the accident (\u00a7655.44(a)(2)). A decision m ust be m ade using the b est inform ation available at the time of the decision. The term \"completely discounted\" does not address preventability, chargeab ility, or acc ident fault, but rathe r assesses if the em ployee in any way contributed to the accident. For non-fatal accidents, the em ployer shall tes t any other saf ety-sensitiv e employee whose perform ance could have contributed to the accident, as determ ined by the em ployer using the best inform ation available at the tim e of the incid ent. Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-8 August 2002 Nonfatal accidents involving a bus, electric bus, van, or automobile m ust meet the definitio n of an accident for thes e types of vehicles (injury or disabling dam age) to be considered an accid ent. For thes e vehicles, \"removal from operation\" is not a criteria for a post-accident test. Thus, employers that tak e a road surface v ehicle (i.e., non-fixed guideway) out of service without m eeting the ot her criteria (i.e., disabling dam age or bodily in jury th at requires im mediate m edical treatm ent away from the scene) m ay not conduct a post- acciden t test under FTA authority. T he portion of the definition that addresses \"rem oval from operation\" is the portion that deals only with vehicles on fixed guideways (i.e., rail car, trolley car, trolley bus) or vessels. The definition for these vehicles does not include disabling dam age. Other Accidents (Non-DOT) Other acc idents tha t do n ot meet thes e criteria m ay be conducted under the employer's own authority, but not under the authority of the FTA regulation. Thus, employers that choose to test for accidents that m eet a property dam age threshold, backing accidents, etc., must do so under their own authority using non-DOT form s. All Acciden ts Post-accident drug and alcohol tests must be perform ed as soon as possible following th e accid ent. If an alcohol test is not adm inistered within 2 hours following the acc ident, the em ployer m ust still attem pt to adm iniste r the test, and must also prepare and m aintain on f ile a re cord sta ting the reason(s) the test was not prom ptly administered. This docum entation requirem ent should not be m isconstrued to mean that employers have 2 hours to get an alcohol test conducted. To the contrary, the 2-hour provision only triggers when docum entation of the delay is required. The alcohol test must be conducted as soon as possible following the accident. If an alcohol test is still no t adm inistered within 8 hours following the accident, the em ployer shall cease attem pts to adm inister an alcohol test and shall m aintain re cords on why the test was not perform ed. Likewise, if a drug test has not been perform ed within 32 hours, the em ployer m ust cease attem pts to conduct the drug test and docum ent why the test was not adm inistered. Employers must ensure that testing services are available at all tim es and in all locations wh ere saf ety-sensitive functions are performed. Unavailability of testing sites is an u nacceptable explanation for not conducting a test. Em ployers should review their opera tions to deter mine if there are locations or tim e periods that cannot be served by the prim ary collection site. If gaps in testing coverage exist, the em ployer must estab lish alternativ e procedu res in anticipation of accidents during th ese tim es. If procedures are not established in advance, the em ployer m ay be unable to adm inister required tests. The circum stances that require a post- acciden t test for drugs are the sam e circum stances that require a post-accident test for alcohol. Theref ore, every accident that m eets th e FTA accid ent definitio n must result in both a drug and alcohol test. The only circumstance where a drug test would be conducted, but not an alcohol test, is in the rare event the em ployee is unav ailable (e.g., unconscious, incarcerated) for an alcohol test during the 8-hour window, but is available within the 32-hour window for drugs.

Types of Testing 6-10 August 2002 In the rare event that an em ployee is unable to p erform a post-acc ident tes t within the required tim e period (i.e., 8 hours for alcohol and 32 hours for drugs) due to circum stances beyond the em ployer's control, the results of a blood, urine, or breath alcohol test conducted by a federal, state, or local official having independent authority for the test, will be considered to meet the req uirements for a post-acc ident test. The test m ust conform to the applic able f ederal, sta te, or loca l testing requirem ents and m ust be obtained by the employer. Circum stances beyond the employer's control m ight include instances where the employee is incarcerated, unconscious, or requires m edical treatm ent that precludes the FTA testing. Testing for drugs and alcohol follow ing an accid ent must be perform ed as soon as possible following the accident, but should in no way delay necessary m edical attention for injured p eople or p rohibit a saf ety- sensitive em ployee from leaving the s cene of an accident to obtain assis tance o r necessary em ergency medical care. However, the saf ety-sensitive em ployee must rem ain readily available, which means the transit agency know s the location of the safety-sensitive em ployee. Em ploye es that leave the scene of the accident p rior to subm itting to the test without notifying the employer of his/her location m ay be deem ed to have refused the test. If a collision/incident does not m eet the FTA accident definition (\u00a7655.4) or if the definition is m et, but the em ployer completely discounts the em ployee's perform ance as a contributing factor in a non-fatal accident, the decision not to administer a drug and/or alcohol test must be docum ented in detail, including the decision-m aking process used to reach the decision not to test. Results fro m tests adm inistered by law enforcem ent personnel m ay not be used if the em ployer could have, but did not perform its own test. T his provision does not perm it employers to ignore their obligation to test, nor does it prohibit duplicated post-accident testing. In such cases, it is e xpected that the em ployer will conduct FT A drug and alcohol tests, while law enforcem ent officials conduct tests under their own authority. In instances where law enforcem ent test results are accepted in lieu of FTA test results, the employer must docum ent the circum stances which prevented the FT A drug and alcohol tests from being conducted. This provision im poses no requirement on federal, state, or lo cal officials to perform post-accident testing for FTA covered employers. Em ployers should not assum e that law enforcem ent personnel routinely perform post-accident testing or tha t law enforcem ent officials will m ake test results readily available to them. Most law enforcem ent agencies will require a Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-11 August 2002 subpoena or official re quest to release test results to employers. Procedures Follow ing an Accident The steps to f ollow in a p ost-ac cident situa tion a re summarize d as f ollows: 1. Treat any injury firs t. The acciden t victim s' physical health is always a higher priority than conducting a substance abuse test. 2. Cooperate w ith law enforcement officials. Allow local la w enforcem ent to conduct their investigation. For purposes of their investigatio n, the police m ay require a test for a legal de termination of the presence of drugs or alcohol. Remember that you cannot use the results of a test given for law enforcem ent purposes un less th e employee is unavailable for FTA testing during the designated tim e period following the accident. You must use due diligence to adm inister post-accident tests in accordance with FTA's regulations. 3. Determine if the incident meets th e FTA definition of an accident . Based on the inform ation available at the tim e of the incident, determ ine if it meets the FTA criteria for an acciden t. For a nonfatal acciden t, determ ine if the oper ator can be completely discounted as a contributing factor. Determ ine if any other covered em ployee besides the driver could have contributed to the acciden t. Determ ine whom to test. 4. Explain the need for testing. Tell the em ployee(s) that a test is required by FTA regulations to be conducted. Point out to the em ployee that a negativ e finding will ob jectiv ely put to rest any suspicion of drugs and alcohol as a cause of the accident. 5. Conduct tests promptly. The FTA regulations require that specim en collection be perform ed as soon as possible, but no later than 8 hours for alcohol and 32 hours following the acciden t for drugs. 6. Document the test decision promptly. As soon as practical following th e accid ent, document the reason why a test was conducted or why one was not. Figures 6-3 and 6-5 at the end of this chapte r, illu strate the post-ac cident testing processes for alcohol and drugs. Section 4. RANDOM TESTI NG The FTA regulation (\u00a7655.45) requires random testing of drugs and alcohol for all safety-sensitive em ployees. Random testing can identify em ployees who are using drugs or misusing alcohol, but are able to use the predictability of other testing m ethods to escape detection. More importantly, it is widely believed that random testing serves as a strong deterrent against em ployees beginning or continui ng prohibited drug use and m isuse of alcohol. Transit agen cies m ust use a scientifically valid random -number selection m ethod to selec t safety-sensitiv e employees. Valid methods include the use of a random- number table or a com puter-based random - number generator that is m atched with safety-sens itive em ployees' iden tification numbers (i.e., security ber, payroll number, or other em ployer identification num ber). Picking numbers from a hat or other m anual techniques are not accep table due to inh erent o r perceived Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-12 August 2002 Even though the alc ohol testing rate was origin ally es tablishe d at 25 percent, the alcohol testing rate was lowered to 10 percent in 1998 based on industry-wide violation rates below 0.5 percent for the two consecutive preced ing y ears. The alcohol testing ra te will be incre ased back to 25 percent if the violation rate is grea ter than 0.5 percent but less than 1 percent for any single year. The alcohol rate can increase to 50 percent if the viol ation rate exceeds 1 percent in any given year. The alcohol violation rate is calculated each year by adding the n umber of positiv e rando m tests to the num ber of refusals of random tests and dividing the sum by the to tal nu mber of random tests attem pted (com pleted plus refused). biases in the process. To be considered scientifically valid, each covered em ployee must have an equal chance of being picked each tim e selections are m ade. Testing Rates The num ber of random drug tests to be conducted each year m ust equal at least 50 percen t of the tota l num ber of safety- sensitive em ployees subject to drug testing, included in the testing pool. A slightly higher percentage (+5%) should be tested to provide for cancelled tests. The number of random alcohol tests conducted each year must equal at least 10 percent of the covered employees included in the pool. If the trans it sys tem joins a co nsortium for random -number selection, the annual rate may be calculated for each individual consortium organizational m ember or for the total num ber of safety-se nsitive em ployees within th e consortium (see Chapter 1 1, \"Consortia and Third Party Adm inistra tors\"). Industry- wide Positive Random Test Results Alcohol Random Testing Rate Drug Random Testing Rate Less than 0.5% 10% 25% Greater than 0.5 % but less th an 1% 25% 25% Greater than 1% 50% 50% The FTA's random alcohol and drug testing rates m ay be adjusted based on analys is of positiv e drug and alcoho l violations rates for th e entire transit industry (\u00a7655.45(d)) as reported in the annual industry-wide Managem ent Inform ation System report. If the transit indu stry as a whole gener ates a rando m positive d rug tes t result of less than 1 percent for two consecutive calendar years, FTA m ay reduce the drug testing rate to 25 percent. FTA may not lower the drug testing rate below 25 percent. If, subsequently, the random positiv e dru g test rate ev er exce eds 1 percen t during any single calendar year, the drug test rate will be increased back up to the 50 percent level. A summa ry of the rates is presented in the followin g chart. Note: To reduce t he testing rate the i ndustry -wide positive rates must be at the designated level for 2 consecutive years, while the rate wil l incre ase if the positive test rate raises one level during any single year . The m inimum annual percentage rates will be pub lished in th e Federal Register each year for the following calendar year and noted in the FTA Drug and Alcohol Regulation Updates . The rates will be applicable f or the calendar year beginning on January 1 of the calendar year following publication of the random testing rates. The rates are con sidered m inimum s. Employers who choose to test at higher rates m ay do so Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-13 August 2002 as long as the testing rate is addressed in their policy statem ent. Calculation of the Number of Random Tests The m ethod used to figure the actual number of random tests needed has confused many in the industry, often resulting in under-testing by m any and som e unnecessary over-testing by others. Transit system employee bases often fluctuate over the course of a year due to term inations, new hires, or seasonal variations due to weather, school/university sessions, or tourist seasons. Consequently, the size of the random testing pool also fluctuates. Some transit system s have established the size of their pool by estim ating the number of safety-sens itive em ployees employed as of January 1 (or any other arbitrary date) of each y ear. This m ethod is incorrect. T o clarify this issue, a s tep-by- step m ethod of calculation is provided in Figure 6-1. Only com pleted tests can be used to meet the random test rate. Thus, if any of the individuals selected during the current test period were not te sted or the test was cancelled, an adjustm ent must be made when calculating the number of tests to be perform ed during the ne xt testing period to ensure th at the required rates are ach ieved within th e year. Progr ess toward ra te achievem ent should be monitored throughout the year to avoid the need to make one major adjustm ent at the end of the year. Also, consortia use the sam e method of calculation. The em ployer and consortium must have p rocedures in place to ens ure that the pool is u p-to-date before each draw, and to inform the random selector of cancelled or incom plete tes ts that will r equire an adjustm ent in the num ber of draws made for the next testing period. A reporting requirem ent in the MIS Drug and Alcohol Data Collection form s has also caused confusion in determ ining the number of random tests needed. These forms require each em ployer to repo rt the number of covered em ployees that were employed in each safety -sensitive fun ction. The MIS form requires that the num ber of covered em ployees reported be a cumulative total of all employees perform ing safety- sensitive functions over the course of the reporting year. Given employee turnover, cumulative totals usu ally exceed th e num ber of safety-sensitiv e positions since th ey count all individuals that fell under the FT A regulatory authority sometim e during the year. Many people have assum ed that the random test rate should be based on this cumulative total. This is not the c ase, and would result in too m any tests for system s with larger staff turnover. Rather, you should use the m ethod described in Figure 6-1, which reflects the fl uctuation in staffing levels. Random Te sting Pool Management All saf ety-sensitive em ployees in the random pool m ust have an equal chance of being selected for testing and shall rem ain in the pool, even after be ing tested. It is possible for som e employees to be tested several tim es in one year, and other employees not to be tested for several years. Depending on the size of the safety-sensitive employee pool, num bers m ay be selected on a periodic basis, us ually daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Selections should be made as frequently as possible, but not less often than quarterly (see chart on page 6- 16). Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-14 August 2002 1. Determ ine how frequently random draws ar e made (daily, weekly, m onthly, quarterly, etc.). This is the testing period. 2. For each testing period, d etermine the num ber of safety-sensitive em ployees that are in the pool. Be sure to update the file prior to the random draw to ensure that all new hires and indiv iduals placed in to active status have been added to the pool, and those who have been discharged or put on inactive status have been rem oved. 3. Calculate the num ber of tests to be perf ormed during the testing period as follows: a. Multip ly the num ber of safety-sens itive em ployees in the poo l at the b eginning of the testing per iod by the req uired testing rate (50 percent for drugs and 10 percent for alcohol). b. Divide the total by the num ber of testing pe riods in the year (quarterly = 4; m onthly = 12; weekly = 52; and daily = 365). The result is the num ber of tests to be perf ormed for that testing period. T his method is demonstrated in the table provided below. Testing Period Safety- Sensitiv e Employees in Period (A) Test Periods Per Year (B) Random Rate Drug (C) Random Rate Alcohol (D) # of Drug Tests Required (A*C)/B # of Alcohol Tests Required (A*D)/B Quarter 1 160 4 50% 10% 20 4 Quarter 2 126 4 50% 10% 16 4 Quarter 3 62 4 50% 10% 8 2 Quarter 4 168 4 50% 10% 21 5 Total Year 65 15 4. Once the number of tests pe r testing period has been cal culated, the total should be adjusted for cancelled tests. Figure 6-1. Method for Calculatin g the Number of Random Tests Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-15 August 2002 Suggested Frequencies of Random-number Selections Random Tests Per Year Frequency of Random - number Selections 1-11* Quarterly 12-51 Monthly 52-364 Weekly >364 Daily * Small systems that cond uct few tests per year may need t o conduct more tests to ensure t he testing is sprea d throughout t he year. Once an employee is selected, the employer should schedule the collection within th e testing pe riod (i.e., week, month, quarter) and m ake sure the em ployee is not inadver tently notif ied of the te st until it is time to proc eed to th e collection s ite. Tests should be perform ed eve nly throughout the testing per iod to elim inate predictab ility. If the em ployee is off-duty or otherwise unavailable at the tim e the em ployer desires to conduct the test, the test should be postponed u ntil the em ployee is on-d uty, if the test can be perfor med during the testing period for which the number was selected. The only explanation for selecting another number and substituting a replacem ent for the original individual is in the rare e vent the origin ally se lected em ployee will no t work (or perform safety-sensitive duties in the case of an alcohol test) during the entire testing period. Logi stical difficulties, operational requirem ents, or com plicated personnel issues that m ake the testing process m ore difficult are not acceptable reasons for choosing a replacem ent. Likewise, convenience of the em ployer, collection facility, or mobile testing unit should not influence whom to test. Anytim e the or igina lly selec ted employee is n ot tested, the employer should docum ent the reason for not testing and address the individual's unavailab ility during the whole testing period. All saf ety-sensitive em ployees m ust be included in the random pool. Thus, the random pool should be purged prior to each testing period to ensure that the random process will not be com promised. All new hires and tr ansfers into a safety-sens itive position since the last draw m ust be added to the pool. Sim ilarly, all covered em ployees that have retired, quit, are on leave or been fired, or otherwise expected to be unavailable throughout the testing period must be removed from the pool. If the transit agency decides to random ly test non-safety-sensit ive em ployees, those employees must be placed in a separate pool and tes ted under the tran sit ag ency's authority, and not under the authority of the DOT and FTA. Once the list of e mployee identification numbers has been developed, use it for random selection. One way to do this is to contract out the random -num ber selection process. Preferably, the contractor organization would only have the numbers and would not be able to corre late th em with any em ployee nam e. If an outside service agent is used for this purpose, care must be taken to ensure that the random -number draw is communicated to the Design ated Employer Representative in a confidential manner. Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-16 August 2002 In many small trans it system s, every employee is considered s afety-sens itive and is included in the random pool. If, as a result, the employer's D APM is in the random pool, som eone outside of the pool must be responsible for perform ing the random -number selection. The trans it system 's DAPM is also usually the contact person to whom the random selections are reported and who schedules the tests for all em ployees. However, when the DAPM's num ber is random ly selected, another system employee or responsible indi vidual (e.g., the county personnel director) should be designated as the contact. This person should schedule and notify the D APM of the need for the test, and ensure that the test is perform ed immediately upon notification. The DAPM should be subject to the sam e level of disclosure as others that are selected for testing. Scheduling Random Te sts The test dates m ust be spread reasonably throughout the year so as not to establish a predictable pattern (e.g., the first Tuesday of each m onth) (\u00a7655.45(g)). The number of tests conducted weekly, monthly, or quarterly should rem ain relatively constant to the extent possibl e reflecting seasonal variations in the em ployee base. Conducting all of your tests in one month, for exam ple, does not achieve the goal of unpredictable testing. Likewise, the testing should be perform ed on different days of the week. Most im portantly, however, random testing m ust be conducted at all tim es of the day when safety-sensitive functions are perform ed. This prevents em ployees from coordinating their drug and alcohol use to the random testing schedule. To be effective, employees should be on-notice at all tim es that they cou ld be tes ted an ytime they are on duty, day or night. If employees can pred ict when tests will not b e performed due to em ployer policy, operational logistics, un availability of collection sites, etc., th e ran dom program will be compromised. Random drug tests can be conducted at any tim e the em ployee is on duty. An employee who m ay be called on to perform a safety-sensitive function at any tim e and who is receiving pay for such tim e, is on duty for the purpose of random drug testing. Random alcohol tests, however, can only be conducted just before, during, or after the employee is perform ing safety-sensitive duties. W hen em ployees are scheduled to perform a safety-sensitive function period ically or as need ed, the em ployee must be subject to rando m testing ev en if the occurrence is rare o r sporadic. The process must be unannounced as well as unpredictable. O nce the em ployee has been notified that he/she has been selected for testing, he/she should report immediatel y to the co llection s ite. Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-17 August 2002 Employees are not to be given any advance notice. When developing a random testing program , you should establish a standard procedure and practice f or notifying employees who have been selected. In scheduling tests, be careful not to provide any indication of when the testing will occur. Every effort should be made to provide the m aximum privacy possible. Em ployees should be individually and discretely notif ied to r eport to the colle ction site. Assure those em ployees selected for testing that this is a routin e rand om test. Th ey should not feel that they have been singled out for testing for reas onable suspicion or for som e other unstated reason. Flowcharts detailing the random testing process m ay be found at the end of this chapter. The FTA Random Drug Testing Manual , published in Septem ber 1991, describes the random selection process in detail. Consult this publication when choosing an approach to random testing, deciding when to test, and developing the selection and notification procedures. Section 5. RETURN-TO-DUTY TES TING Before any employee is allowed to return -to-duty to perf orm a saf ety-sensitive function following a verified positive drug test result, an alcohol result of 0.04 or greater, a refusal to subm it to a test, or any other activity that violates the regulations, that em ployee m ust first be evaluated by a SAP and pass a return-to-duty test (\u00a7655.46, \u00a740.285). This test and the SAP's evaluation of an individual's return-to- duty status provides some degree of assurance to the em ployer that the ind ividual is pre sently f ree of alcohol and/or any pr ohibited drugs and is able to return to work without undue concern about continued substance abuse and public safety. Recommend ation Random Testing One of the most sensitive types of testing is random testing. Indeed, i f your system is challenged o n a ran dom t est, you may be required to d emonstrate that you are pr operly applying a va lid rand om selection methodology. Small trans it system s may be best ser ved by contracting out the random sele ction process. Part of the responsibility t hat can be contracted out involves maintaini ng the random te st pool by using unique identification numbers from each member syste m to update the pool membe rship. Because emp loyees of all system s are pooled to gether, the po ol is large en ough that the predictability of the test is lessened. Likewise, since no manage r at any of the transit syste ms is inv olved in the s election process (all selections are done in a controlled access area of the consort ium manage ment company), no employee nee d fear that he or she has be en unfairly singled out for testing . Many alcohol or drug users are \"polyusers;\" that is, they use both alcohol and drugs. T herefore, the DOT regulations allow the e mployer to administe r return-to - duty tests for both drugs and alcoho l, even though the original infraction was due to alcohol or drugs only. Before a return-to-duty test is perform ed, the em ployee m ust be evaluated by a SAP to determ ine if the em ployee has successfully followed all the re commendation s for action by the SAP, including participation in any rehabilitation program . The SAP must recomm end an education or treatm ent program in response to every referral. Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-18 August 2002 Before m aking the return-to-duty recomm endation, the S AP must obtain docum entation from the recomm ended treatm ent program and confer with treatm ent professionals regarding the em ployee's progress. T he SAP m ust also conduct a face-to-face clin ical interview with th e employee to determ ine if the em ployee has complied with the recomm endations. Based on input from the SAP, the return- to-duty d ecision m ust ultim ately be m ade by the em ployer. If the SAP does not believe the individual has successfully complied with the recomm ended treatm ent program , the em ployer m ust not allow the em ployee to return to his/he r safety-sensitiv e duties. See Chapter 9 for a m ore detailed discussion on the ro le of the SAP. Once the SAP has determ ined that the employee has successfully com plied with the treatm ent recomm endations and the employer has decided the individual can return to work, a re turn-to-duty test must be perform ed. The em ployee m ust have a verified negative drug test result and/or an alcohol test result of less than 0.02 to return to a safety-sensitive f unction. If a drug test result is cancelled, the employer shall require the employee to subm it to and pass another drug test. If an em ployee is unable to provide a sufficient amount of urine to perm it a return- to-duty drug test (i.e., 45 m L), the collector must follow the \"in sufficient vo lume\" procedures defined in \u00a740.193 and later described in Chapter 7. If when following these pro cedures, the employee is still unable to provide a sufficient specim en, the employer must direct the em ployee to obtain an evaluation from a licensed physician within 5 days. The physician m ust be acceptable to the MRO and have ex pertise in the field. T he physician m ust ascertain whether there is a m edical condition that with a high degree of probability precluded the em ployee from providing a sufficient amount of urine. Addi tionally, the physician must determ ine if the em ployee's m edical condition is the resu lt of a serious and perm anent or long-term disability. If so, the MRO or evaluating physician m ust determ ine if there is c linical ev idence of illicit drug use. The MRO/physician m ay conduct an alternative test (e.g., blood test) as part of the m edical evaluation. If there is no evidence of illega l drug use, the MRO must report the test result as negative, thereby allowing the employee to be assigned safety-sensitive duties. Figures 6-4 and 6-6 at the end of this chapte r, illu strate the return-to -duty testing processes for alcohol and drugs. Section 6. FOLLOW-UP TES TING Required Testing Once allowed to return-to-duty, an employee shall be subject to unannounced follow-up te sting f or at least 12 bu t not more than 60 m onths. The frequency and duration Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-19 August 2002 of the f ollow-up testing will be recomm ended by the S AP as long as a minimum of six tests are perform ed during the first 12 months after the em ployee has returned to duty (\u00a7655.47, \u00a740.301). Six tests the first year should be considered a minimum and should be the exception, not the rule. Every case should be decided on its own m erits based on the unique circum stances of the individual. The SAP m ay recomm end follow-up testing of employees beyond the 12-month requirem ent (\u00a740.307). Follow-up testing must not exceed 60 m onths from the tim e the em ployee returns to duty, but can be terminated a nytim e after the f irst 12 months if the SAP determ ines testing is no longer required. To be effective, follow-up testing should be conducted frequently. Depending upon the SAP's evaluation and recomm endation, testing m ay be conduc ted with varying frequency (weekly, biweek ly, or m onthly) at the outset, and m ay be reduced to m onthly or quarter ly testing as th e first com plete yea r of recovery is approached. If the em ployee is subject to drug follow-up te sts, the SAP m ay also recomm end the em ployee take one or m ore follow-up alcohol tests w ith a required result less than 0.04. Conversely, the em ployee is subject to alcohol follow -up tests, the SAP may recomm end that the em ployee take one or more follow-up drug tests with a verified negative result (\u00a740.307(c)). The SAP wi ll docum ent his/her recomm endations in a w ritten f ollow-up testing plan that the em ployer is requ ired to follow. The plan will not provide actual test dates, bu t instead wi ll give direction on frequency and duration of the required testing. The em ployer may not im pose additional testing requirem ents beyond the SAP's follow-up testing plan. The S AP recomm endations are non-negotiable. Only the SAP m ay modify hi s/her evaluation and recomm endations based on new or additional infor mation. Follow-up tests m ust be unannounced with no predictable pattern. No one can substitute any other test (e.g., treatm ent tests, rando m tests) fo r a follow-up test, and you cannot count a cancelled test as a completed follow-up tes t. Cancelled follow- up tests m ust be recollected. Follow-up testing is separate from and in addition to the regular random testing program . Employees who are subject to follow-up te sting m ust also rem ain in the standard random pool and m ust be tested whenever th ey are s elected, even if this means being tested twice in the sam e day, week, or m onth. Follow-up testing bo th motivates th e employee to rem ain free of any prohibited substances and provides you with assurance that the person has not resum ed drug use or alcohol m isuse. However, depending on the individual, the substance of abuse, and the effectivenes s of treatm ent, the relap se rate might be high. Employers and em ploye es should also be aware that the follow-up testing plan follows the em ployee to subsequent DOT covered em ployers and/or through breaks in service. The SAP m ay conclude that the employee has successfully dem onstrated compliance even though the em ployee has yet to com plete th e entir ety of the ed ucation or treatm ent program . The SAP then m ay recomm end that the em ployee con tinue in an afterca re pro gram in addition to the f ollow- Chapter 6. Types of Testing 6-20 August 2002 up testing program . The SAP m ust docum ent the recomm endations. Upon receiving a recomm endat ion for aftercare from the SAP, the em ployer is en couraged to cre ate a r eturn- to-duty contract w ith the employee that requ ires the em ployee to comply with the aftercare recomm endations. Such a contract spells out desired em ployee perform ance goals and obligations (e.g., remaining free of prohibited substances, complying with aftercare recomm endations ) and clearly s tates the con sequences if the employee fa ils to adhere to the provisions of the contract. If a return-to-duty agreem ent is created, the em ployee is obligated to comply with the SAP's recomm endat ion for these services [40.303(c)].

Chapter 7 . DRUG TES TING PROCEDURES Ampheta mines (e.g., racem ic ampheta mine, dextroamphetam ine, and m ethamphetam ine). Under the F TA drug testing regulation for safety-sensitiv e em ployees, you are required to conduct laboratory testing of urine specim ens for five types of drugs (\u00a7655.21). Identification of either a drug or its m etabolite in the u rine indicates recent use of the drug. A m etabolite is a m odified form of a dr ug that has been chem ically altered by the body's m etabolic system. Depending upon the drug and the person's usage habits, the detection period ranges from less than one day to a m onth or m ore. The Departm ent of Health and Human Services (DHHS) establishes the m inimum thresho ld levels for each of the five drugs tested under USDOT testing program s including the FTA. Minim um levels are established f or both the initial sc reening tes t and for the confirm atory test. The m inimum thresholds are established at lev els high enough to prevent a po sitive reading for secondhand smoke or incidental contact with one of the substances. To obtain a positive test result, the indiv idual would need to actually consum e a quantity of the substance (i.e., smoke, inject, ingest) that is consistent with illegal drug use. The FTA regulation requires testing for the followin g drugs (or their m etabolites ): Marijuana Cocaine A comm on m ethod of marijuana consum ption is the ingestion of food products, such as brownies, that have had marijuana added to the ingredients. Also, some manufacturers have begun to m arket food products containing hem p seeds or extracts. These products m ay have THC Opiates (e.g., heroin, m orphine, codeine) Phencyclid ine (PCP) Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-1 August 2002 (Delta 9-tetrahydroca nnabinol-9 carboxylic acid, th e active ingred ient in m arijuan a) levels high enough to result in a positive test result for m arijuana. Sin ce thes e pro ducts do not constitute a \"legitim ate medical explanation\" for the pres ence of THC in an individual's specim en, test results will be confirm ed as positive if they exceed the minimum thresholds established with corresponding FTA and em ployer consequences. Part 40.151(f) states that the Medical Review Officers (MRO) \"must not accept an as sertion of consum ption or other use of a hemp or other non-prescription marijuana-related product as a basis of verifying a m arijuana test negative.\" This also in cludes the m edicinal use of marijuana that m ay be perm itted by som e states, but is not recognized by federal law. Laboratory testing Medical Review Officer (MRO) Substance A buse Professional (SAP) If you do not have qualified individuals on staff, you will need to identify qualified service agen ts to prov ide each of thes e services. You m ay purchase the services of each agen t individually, or you m ay wish to purchase services from a consortium or third party adm inistra tor (C /TPA) that pac kage two or m ore services together for one price. Chapter 11 provides a detailed discussion of the use of C/TPAs, the services they provide, and their lim itations. Each of the above services is discussed individually in this section. Section 2. SPECIMEN COLLECTION If you choose to test for other drugs, such as barb iturates, stim ulants, you m ay do so as long as the tests for those additional drugs are performed separately from the FTA test. Such testing is outside the scope of the FTA regulation and is entirely at the discretion of the transit sy stem . Perform ing tests separately m eans that you m ust obtain a separate urine specim en from the employee and process that specim en with its own non- federal custody and control form . Employees must be notified whether they are being tested under the FTA required program or the em ployer's program . Collect ion Sites. All urin e specim ens must be collected at an appropriate colle ction site. A coll ection site is defined (\u00a740.3) as \"a place sel ected by the employer where em ployees pres ent them selves for the purpose of providing a urine specim en for a drug test.\" You are re quired to designate one or m ore sites, depending on your needs. Collection site services must be available while saf ety-sensitiv e functions are perform ed. Subsequently, m any employers have found it necessary to contract w ith more than o ne collectio n site o r obtain supplem ental on-call coll ection services to ensure that all tim e periods are covered. Section 1. OBTAINING PROGRAM SERVICES Typically, collection sites are located at physician's offices, comm ercial collection sites, m obile vans, or a local hospital or clinic; howe ver, the re is no requirement that a collection site b e located at a m edical facility. Any location th at meets the minimum requirem ents specified in S ubpart D of Part 40 m ay be used. In establishing an effective drug testing program , you will need to utilize c ertain specialized s ervice agents to perform various functions. These include the following: Specim en collection Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-2 August 2002 Recommend ation Multiple Coll ection Sites Many transit systems have found t hat one collection site is not enough to meet the total testing requirements for their agency. Employers have often found that collection sites have limited hours of operation and therefore can not conduct tests during all days and times tha t safety-sensitive functions are being perfor med. In response, agencies have contracted with secondary collection sites to supplement th e primary collection site. Sometimes, the supplemental sites are hospitals or c linics that h ave extended work hours or are willing to provide services on an on-call basis. Other syst ems have contracted with off-duty nurses or other medical personnel to conduct after -hour collections on transit system premise s. Some transit system s may wish to estab lish co llection sites on their own prem ises. On-prem ise collection sites m ay also be used during tim es when comm ercial or third party sites are unavailable (e.g., nights, weekends, holidays). Regardless of where the colle ction site is located, it m ust meet Departm ent of Transportation guidelines established in \"Procedures for Transportation W orkplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Program s\" (49 CFR Part 40, Subpart D). The regulation (\u00a740.41) requires, in part, that the collection site provide all necessary personnel, materials, equipm ent, fac ilities, and storage space necessary to condu ct the test consistent w ith the regulations. At a minimum, the site m ust provide a privacy enclosure for urinati on (preferably a single- toilet room having a full-length privacy door), a su itable clean w riting surface, and a water source for hand washing, which if practicable, should be outside the privacy enclosure. If a water so urce is p resent insid e the privacy enclosure, th at water sou rce as well as other substances that could be used for adulte ration and subs titution (e.g. , water faucets, soap dispensers) m ust be secured, and m oist towelettes m ust be provided for hand washing outside the privacy enclosure. No one but the donor m ay be present in the privacy enclosure during the collection, except for th e observer in the even t of a directly observed collection. If a multi-stall restroom facility is us ed, the site m ust provide substantial visual privacy su ch as a pa rtial-length doo r, all water sources in the restroom must be secured, and bluing agent m ust be added to the othe r toilets, or th ey must be secured to prevent acce ss. Addition ally, a m ulti-sta ll facility requ ires that a person of the sam e gender or a m edical professional m onitor the collection. The m onitor enters the room with the donor, but rem ains outside the stall and does not watch the employee urinate into th e collection cup (\u00a740.69). A multi- stall collec tion is the on ly tim e a m onitor is perm itted. A m onitored colle ction is significantly different from an observed collection, which is disc ussed later in this chapter. Collection site operators must take necessary steps to prevent unauthorized access to the collection facility that could compromise a collection 's integrity. Access to the site m ust be restricted during specim en collection to ensure privacy and prevent the collector fro m becom ing distracted. Lim ited access signs m ust be posted. Addition ally, ac cess to co llection materials and specim ens m ust be restricted. Only specim en donors, collectors, other collection site workers, DERs, e mployee and em ployer representatives, and DOT agency rep resentatives are autho rized to enter any part of the site in which ur ine specim ens are collected or stored. The colle ction site m ust have a policy and procedures in place to prevent anyon e else from enterin g the collection area. All Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-3 August 2002 authorized individuals are under the supervision of the collector at all tim es when in the co llection area. T he collecto r may remove any person who obstructs, interferes with, or causes a delay in the collection process. Recommend ation Mobile Collectors Have Li mitations Many transit systems and state consortia use mobile collectors to collect urine and breath specimens for the FTA drug and alcohol testin g program. Mobile collectors are often associated with or under contract to third party administrators who provide all the testing servic es as part of a turnkey package. The mobile collectors are often conside red an economical method for o btaining collection servi ces in ar eas, times, or situations that have limited collection site alternatives. In most cases, mobile collectors notify the transit system when they will be on-site for random test collections. Many transit systems and statewide consortia find t his arrangement convenient as the mobile collector takes over many of the administrative responsibilities associated with the program. In most cases, mobile collectors provide a collection ser vices that are compliant with the FTA drug and alcohol testing regulati ons. However, FTA-regulated employers must carefully monitor the polici es and practi ces of mobile collectors. A primary concern is the predictability and pattern of testing that is often charact eristic of mobile collectors. To economically provide testing services, mobile collectors typ ically attempt to schedule collections in the most cost-efficient manner possible. Subsequently, collectors often ride a circuit from transit system to transit system, and so patterns develop. Additionally, mobile collectors that are not clos e to the transit system cannot respond in a timely manner for post-accident or reasonabl e suspicion tests. Since an incident triggers the need for a test, and t he transi t system must respond immediately, prior arrange ments for a collector within close proximity is nece ssary. Collection Site Person nel. A collector is a trained person who instru cts and assists employees at a collectio n site, receiv es and makes an initia l inspe ction of the urine specim en provided by those em ployees, and initiates and com pletes th e Federa l Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (CCF). Only individuals that m eet the m inimum requirem ents for collectors defined in Subpart C of 49 CFR Par t 40 are authorized to collect u rine specim ens for DOT drug testing. The m inimum requirem ents that a collector m ust have in order to perform their duties include basic inform ation, qualification training, initial proficiency demonstration, refresher training, and error- correction training. These requirem ents are discussed in Chapter 5, S ection 6 of this docum ent. The DOT does not require or provide collector certif ication, but instead requires that collectors have docum entation that they ha ve m et the appropriate training requirem ents. If an individ ual becom es a collecto r after August 1, 2001, he/she must m eet the training and proficiency dem onstration requirem ents prior to perform ing any DOT collections. Individuals who served as collectors prior to August 1, 2001, but have not m et the m inimum training requirem ent have until January 31, 2003 to be trained. All collectors m ust have refresher training within 5 yea rs from the date th ey co mpleted their initia l qualif ications training an d every 5 years th ereafter. The imm ediate or direct supervisor of an employee may not serv e as a collecto r for that em ployee (\u00a7655.53). Additionally, the employee may not be the collector of his or her own urine specim en. The Urine Specimen Collec tion Gu idelines also recomm ends that a collector should not be related to the em ployee (e.g., spouse, ex- Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-4 August 2002 5. Secure toilet tank top or put bluing agent in the tank water. spouse, relative) or a close personal friend. The guidelines go on to suggest that to avoid any potential appearance of collusion or impropriety, a saf ety-sensitive em ployee subject to the DOT dr ug testing rules should not be a collector, an observer, or a monitor for co-workers who are in the sam e testing pool or who work together with that employee on a daily basis. 6. Ensure that undetected access is not possible. 7. Secure areas and item s that can be used to conceal con taminants (i.e., vanities, trashcans, paper towel holders). 8. Recheck each colle ction f acility following each collectio n. Each collector m ust maintain docum entation of their initial qualifications training, proficiency demonstration, refresher training, a nd error-correction training and provide this docum entation upon request to DOT agency representatives (i.e., auditors, triennial reviewers), and to employers and/or C/TP As using their services. Collectors m ay only conduct one test at a tim e (unless the donor is in an extended wait tim e associated with the insufficient volum e procedure described later in this chapter). T he collecto r must, to the greatest extent possible, keep the donor's specim en within full view of the donor and the colle ctor un til the spec imen is sea led. Only the collector and the don or are allow ed to handle the specim en before it is sealed. The colle ctor m ust rem ain at the collec tion site and be in personal control of the specim en throughout the collection process. The collection site p ersonnel are responsible for maintain ing the integrity of the spec imen colle ction and transfer process, ensuring the security of the specim en, and ensuring the dignity and privacy of the donor. Collectors should conduct their duties with professionalism and avoid any remarks that m ay be construed as accusatory or otherwise offensive or inappropriate. As the em ployer, you are ultim ately responsible for the collection process and as such you should m onitor collection sites closely and require docum entation that collectors have m et the m inimum requirem ents. Contracting for this service removes your staff from direct involvem ent in the co llection and testing process and turns th ese functions ov er to im partia l, outside technical person s who have no direct relationship with your employees. Contracting f or collec tion services, however, does not relieve you from responsibility for ensuring tha t the com plete collec tion ents established by FTA and DOT (\u00a740.15(c)). To deter donors from tampering with their specimens, the specim en collector m ust perform the following tasks prio r to each and every co llection : 1. Secure water sources by turning off water or taping handles to prevent opening faucets. 2. Put bluing a gent in the toile t bowl and swish to ensure dispersion throughout the bowl. 3. Remove all soap, disinfectants, cleaning agents, or other possible adulterants. 4. Inspect the s ite to ensur e that no foreign or unauthorized substances are present. Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-5 August 2002 Supplies. The following supplies and docum ents will be ne eded at ea ch collection site you use. The laboratory with which you contract usually provides these supplies. The collection kit has been standardized and the specifications are def ined in Appendix A of Part 40. Single-Use Collection Cups - The cups m ust be plastic and large enough to easily catch and hold at least 55 m L of urine. The cups m ust have graduated volum e markings clearly noting levels of 45 m L and above. The cups m ust have a temperature strip attached that can provide temperature readings between 90 \u00b0F and 100 \u00b0F. The cups must be individually wrapped or have a peelable, sealed lid (m uch like an orange juice container) or other visible tam per-evident system . Plastic Spec imen Bottles - The plastic spe cimen bottles must be large enough to hold at least 35 m L of urine and must have a screw-on or snap-on cap that p revents seepage during shipm ent. The bottles m ust have clear markings indicating the 30 m L level for the prim ary specim en, and the 15 mL level for the split sp ecimen. The bottles m ust be designed so that the required tamper-evident tape bottle seals fit with no damage to the seal when applied or initialed. The bottles m ust be wrapped in a sealed plastic bag, shrink wrapped, have a sealed lid, or be packaged by som e other easily visible tam per-evident system . The plastic m aterial m ust be leak resistant. Leak-Resis tant Plas tic B ag - The plastic bag must have two sealable compartments or pouches that are leak resistant. One pouch m ust be large enough to hold tw o specim en bottles and the other large enough to hold the CCF paper work. Once closed, the bag m ust be tam per- evident. Absorbent Mater ial - Each kit m ust contain enough absorbent m aterial to absorb the contents of both specim en bottles, and the m aterial must be provided in the plastic bag pouch that holds the specim en bottles. Shipping Container - The shipping container must be designed to adequately p rotect the sp ecim en bottles from dam age during shipping. Federal Drug Testing C ustody and Control Form (CCF)- This form must be used to docum ent every urine collection re quired under the DOT testing program . The five-part form must include the nam es, addresses, telephone numbers, and fax num bers of the em ployer and the MRO. The CCF documents the chain of custody and is legal evidence tha t the repor ted test resu lts apply to the donor. The Federal CCFs cannot be used for non-DOT urine collections. Furtherm ore, non- federal CCFs cannot be used for DOT urine collections. The CCF form was revised on June 23, 2000. Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-6 August 2002 Collection Process. Specim en colle ction is the m ost critical aspec t of the drug testing program . There is a greater opportunity for hum an error or compromising an em ployee's privacy and dignity in th e collection process than anywhere else in the drug testing process. However, the strict m aintenance of the specim en chain of custody and personnel training can m inimize the problem s and number of test cancellations resulting from flawed specim en collections. Em ployee confidence in, and accep tance of, the testing process is enhanced when the collection is conducted w ith efficiency and professionalism . You should, therefore, ensure th at the collectio n site p ersonnel rigorously follow DOT guidelines for specim en collection. The DOT requires the new version of the CCF to be used for all DOT covered tests collected after July 31, 2001. Use of a non-federal form or an old version of the form for a DOT collection b y mistake is not a fatal flaw that will resu lt in a cancelled test if the prescrib ed corrective actions (\u00a740.205(b)) are taken. Tamperproof Sealing System - Pre- printed seals/labels are provided as part of the C CF. Once applied to the specim en bottles, the seal ensures that the spec imen bottle has not been opened or tampered with. The label also id entifies the bo ttle with a unique identifying num ber identical to that appearing on the CCF. Writing Instrum ents - An indelible pen or other instrum ent suitable for making perm anent m arkings on labels and seals and for legibly completing the urine custody and control form should be provided. An overview of the key steps and criteria for the collection process follows. Trained collectors who perfor m DOT collections must precisely follow these steps. Fo r specific requirem ents, refer to ation Written Instructions/Checklist Written instructions should be provide d for collection site personnel. T he instruction s should descri be in detail t he procedures for collecting an d transportin g specimens, and completing the custody and control form. These instructions shoul d be available at all times for reference and may be provided in a checklist format to all ow the technician to indicate when each step in the collection process has been accomplished. 1. The arrival tim e of the e mployee should be noted and com pared to the employer-designated arrival tim e to determ ine if the em ployee arrived within th e specified time allowed. I f the em ployee arrived late, the collector m ust imm ediately notify the DER. The tim e noted should be the tim e the em ployee arrives at th e colle ction site, not the tim e the collection begins as there m ay be delays a t the colle ction site tha t are out of the control of the em ployee. Written instr uctions s etting f orth the employee responsibilities for the drug test are provided on the back of the CCF. Exam ples of em ployee and collection site personnel w ritten instructions are provided in the Sam ple Docum entation s ection of this chapter. 2. Following the em ployee's arrival at the collec tion site, the co llector must begin the collecti on process without undue delay. If there is a waiting line for services, em ployees awaiting a test should be m oved t o the front of the line, only to be disp laced by Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-7 August 2002 individuals with em ergency or life- threatening conditions. Testing should not be delayed because the employee indicates that they don't believe they can provide a specim en. If this is the case, th e collecto r should follow the \"insufficient volum e\" procedures. L ikewise the test should not be delayed to await union representation. 3. In the event both drug and alcohol tests are required, the alcohol test should be conducted first, if possible. 4. The collecto r must inspect the collection room befo re and after each specim en collection. Any unauthorized persons and m aterials that cou ld be used to ad ulterate the specim en must be rem oved. Access to the room must be restricted while the collectio n is tak ing place. The collector m ust make sure all collection su pplies are av ailab le, the area is properly secured, water sources are secured, and bluing agent is pla ced in all toilets a s describ ed previously. 5. The collecto r must verify the iden tity of the em ployee through the use of an official p hoto iden tification card issued by the em ployer or a federal, state or local governm ent (e.g., driver's license). Faxes or photocopies of identification are not acceptable. If photo identification is not available, verification by a transit agency rep resentative is acceptable, but cannot be m ade by a coworker or other em ployee being tested. If the identity of the em ployee cannot be verified, the collector m ust contact the DER imm ediately to verify the employee's identity. 6. The collecto r must explain the basic collection p rocedures to the employee and show the employee the written instructions provided on the back of the Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control form. 7. Only Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control for ms can be used. If non-Federal for ms are used for a federal DOT test, the test will be cancelled un less co rrective procedures are followed. The preprinted specim en ID num ber must be checked to be sure it m atches the specim en ID num ber on the preprin ted specim en bottle s eals. The collector should m ake sure that the laboratory's, em ployer's, and MRO's name and address are correctly printed on the f orm. Some colle ction sites do testin g for a number of clients, and problem s with billing and reporting can occur if the wrong for ms are used. The collecto r must com plete S tep 1 of the for m by entering the employee's identificatio n num ber, reason for the test, drug test to be perform ed, and the collection site inform ation. Refusal to provide a social security num ber is not a test refusal, but the collecto r must m ake note of such in the rem arks section of the for m. 8. The collecto r must direct the employee to rem ove outer clothing (coveralls, sweaters, jackets, vests, hats, etc.) an d to leav e these garm ents along with other personal belongings (purses, briefcases, backpacks ) outside the p rivacy enclosure. If requested, the employee should be provided a receipt for item s left. Employees are allowed to k eep the ir wallets. Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-8 August 2002 9. The collecto r must direct the employee to em pty his or her pockets and display the item s. If the collector sees noth ing that could be used to adulterate the specim en, the em ployee will be allowed to p lace the items back into th eir po ckets and p roceed with the collection. If any item s are id entified that cou ld be used to tam per with a spec imen, the collector will secure the item until the test is com plete. If the collector d etermines that the items were apparently brought to the collec tion site to adu lterate the specim en, the collector will perform an observed collection. 10. The colle ctor will h ave the employee rinse his or her hands with water and dry them . 11. Either the employee or the collector will select and unwrap the collection cup in front of the employee. The colle ctor will direct the employee to the privacy enclosure taking only the collection cup. Th e collector will instruct the em ployee to provide at least 45 m L (about 1\u00bd ounces) of urine and not to flush the toilet. The c ollector sho uld explain that the tem perature of the specim en must be taken as soon as possible following the void and the specim en should be returned to the collector as soon as the specim en has been obtained. T he collector m ay establish a reasonable amount of time for the em ployee to be in the privacy enclosure as long as the em ployee is told in advance of the tim e lim it. 12. After the employee giv es the specim en to the collector, the collector will check the temperature of the specim en, check the sp ecim en volum e, and inspect the s pecim en for adulteration or substitution. Both the collector and the em ployee should m aintain visual contact with the sp ecimen to the greatest extent possible until the labels/seals are placed o ver the specim en bottle caps. If practical, th e collecto r may perm it the employee to wash his or her hands right after the employee gives the collection container to the collector as long as the em ployee and the collector can still m aintain v isual contro l of the specim en. If not, a m oist towelette may be provided. 13. The tem perature of the s pecim en must be taken within 4 minutes of receiving the specim en. The temperature must be between 90.0 \u00b0 and 100.0 \u00b0F. If the specim en is outside the acceptable tem perature range, the collector will imm ediately begin Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-9 August 2002 a new collection under direct observation as described later in this ch apter. 14. If the em ployee is unable to provide at least 45 m L, the collector will discard the specim en and follow the insufficient volum e procedures describ ed later in this ch apter. 15. If during the collection process, the collector notices any conduct that clearly indicates an attem pt to substitu te or adultera te a specim en, the collection process must be completed and then the collector m ust imm ediately begin a new collection under direct observation as described later in this ch apter. In addition, the colle ction site te chnic ian must visually exam ine the specim en for any unusual color, sedim ent, or other signs of tam pering, and note the results on the custody and control form . If it is apparent that the em ployee has tampered with the sp ecim en, the collector m ust imm ediately begin a new collection under direct observation. 16. If the em ployee refuses to cooperate with the collection process including conducting a new test under direct observation, the collec tor will immediately inform the DER and docum ent the noncooperation on the Feder al Drug Testin g Custody and Control form. 17. In the presence of the donor, the collector will pour the urine into two specim en bottles. T hirty (30) m L will be poured into the prim ary specim en or \"A\" bottle and the cap will be p laced and secured on the bottle. T hen the collector will pour at least 15 m L into th e split specim en or \"B\" bottle and th e cap will be placed and secured on the bottle. 18. The colle ctor will s eal and label the spec imen bottles in the presence of the donor. The preprin ted la bel(s ) with the sam e specim en identif ication num ber as the custody and control form will be rem oved f rom the f orms and attached to the sp ecim en bottles. The colle ctor will ensu re that the \"A\" label is placed on the prim ary specim en and the \"B\" label is placed on th e split specim en. The colle ctor will then write th e date on the seals and then req uest th e em ployee to initial the la bels ver ifying that the specim en is his/hers. The employee must be present to observe the sealing of the bottles. The em ployee m ust initial the labels after they have been attached to the bottle, not before. 19. The rem aining steps of the Federal Drug Testing C ustody and Control for m (CCF) must be completed. The colle ctor will direct the employee to read, sign, and date the certification statem ent, and provide date of birth, printed nam e, and day and Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-10 August 2002 evening con tact telepho ne numbers in Step 5 of Copy 2 of the CCF. The signa ture atte sts to the auth enticity of the s pecim en and inform ation provided and the integ rity of the collectio n process. Refusal to sign the form does not con stitute a ref usal to test, but should be noted by the collector in the rem arks section of the for m. The em ployee is not to put any additional personal inform ation on the CCF. The collector m ust instru ct the em ployee not to list any m edications that he or she is currently taking on the C CF. The em ployee m ay make notes of medications on the back of the employee copy (Copy 5) of the CCF for his or her own personal use, but they m ust not be conveyed to anyone else in the drug testing process. 20. The collecto r com pletes the collector's portion of the CCF by printing his/her nam e, date and time of the collection, entering the nam e of the courier/delivery service and signing the certification statem ent. The CCF is check ed to m ake sure it is complete and legib le and the employee is provided Copy 5 of the form . 21. Both the prim ary specim en and the split sp ecim en m ust be sealed along with Copy 1 of the CCF in the appropriate pouches of the plastic bag. The em ployee will be notified that he/she can leave and the plastic bag will be readied for shipping to the laboratory (e.g., using shipping containers and following procedures defined by the courier service). The specim en should be placed in se cure sto rage until picked up by the courier/delivery service. 22. Copy 2 of the CCF will be sent to the MRO and Copy 4 of the CCF will be s ent to the DER within 24 hours, or the next business day. The specim en must be shipped to the laboratory as soon as possible, but no later than the 24 hours or the next business day. Any urine specim en rem aining after the specim en bottles have be en filled and sealed should be discarded. If the agency tests for drugs other than those specified by the FTA regulation, a com pletely separate urine collection w ith its own non-federal custody and control form is required. Split Sample. As described, the DOT drug testing process requires that the urine specim en be split and po ured in to tw o specim en bottles. The sp lit sp ecim en process p rovides th e em ployee with the option of having an ana lysis of the s plit sample perform ed at a separate DHHS laboratory should the prim ary specim en test result com e into question. The em ployee has 72 hours after being infor med by the MRO of a non-negative test resu lt (i.e., positiv e, adu lterated, sub stitute) to r equest a test of the sp lit sample. Insuffic ient Volume (\u00a740.193, \u00a740.195). If an em ployee is unable to provide 45 mL of urine, the collec tor will discard the s pecim en and instru ct the employee that he/she has up to 3 hours to provide another specim en with sufficient volum e. The 3-hour time period begins when the ins ufficient qua ntity o r empty cup is presented to the collector. During the 3- hour period, the em ployee m ay consum e up to 40 ounces of fluid distributed reasonably throughout the period. T he em ployee's Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-11 August 2002 refusal to drink is not considered a test refusal. However, if the 3 hours have expired and the em ployee refused to m ake the attem pt to provide a new urine specim en, this is cons idered a test refusal, th e process must be discontinued, and the collector m ust notif y the D ER. If reattem pts are m ade that also resu lt in insuf ficient urine vo lumes, the spe cimens must be discarded. Under no circumstances can a collector com bine urine co llected from separate voids to create one specim en of sufficient volum e. The only tim e a speci men with insuf ficient volum e would be m aintained is if a tem perature reading could be obtained and the reading was out of range or there were visible signs of tampering or adulte ration. The colle ctor will com plete the proc ess with the ins ufficient spe cimen, initiate a new collection under direct observation and send both specim ens to the laboratory f or analysis. If the 3 hours have passed and the employee is still unable to provide an adequate sp ecim en, the insufficient specim en shall be discarded, testing discontinued, and the DER notified. After consulting with the MR O, the em ployer must direct the em ployee to obtain a m edical evaluation from a licensed physician who is acceptable to the MRO, and has exp ertise in the m edical issues rais ed by the em ployee's failure to provide a sufficient specim en. The evaluation must be m ade within 5 business days of the initial collection effort. The medical evaluation m ust determ ine if the employee has, or with a high degree of probability could have, a m edical condition that could have precluded the em ployee from providing a sufficient am ount of urine. A medical condition includes an ascertain able physiolog ical cond ition (e.g., urinary dysfunction) or a m edically docum ented pre-existing psychological disorder, but does not include unsupported assertions of \"situational anxiety\" or dehydration. If no m edical explanation is found, the MRO will determ ine that the employee refused the test. If a m edical explanation is found, the MRO will deem the te st can celled f or all test catego ries except for pre-em ploym ent, return-to-duty, For pre-em ploym ent, return-to-duty, and follow-up tests, th e licensed physician making the m edical evaluation m ust also determ ine under the direc tion of the MRO, if the m edical condition is a serious and perm anent, or long-term disability that is highly likely to prevent the em ployee from providing a sufficient urine specim en in the future. If so, the MRO must determ ine via a medical evaluation and consulta tion with the individual's physician if there is clinical evidence that the individ ual is an illicit d rug user. The medical evaluation m ay include conducting an alternative test (e.g., blood) as part of the m edical process used to determ ine clinical evidence of drug use. If no evidence of illicit d rug use is found, the MRO m ust report the test as negative. If evidence is found, the MRO m ust report the test as cancelled. Observed Collec tions. Procedures f or colle cting u rine spec imens shall allo w individual privacy unless there is a reason to believ e that a particul ar individual may alter or substitute the spec imen to be provided (\u00a740.67). In the follo wing circum stances, the collectors are required to com plete the f irst collection and imm ediately require a second collection m ade under direct observation: The em ployee has presented a urine sample that f alls outs ide the norm al temperature range (90.0 \u00b0 to 100.0 \u00b0 Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-12 August 2002 Observed collections m ust be perform ed with no adv ance notice to the em ployee. The direct observation must be conducted by a person of the sam e gender as the employee being tested. The sam e gender requirem ent also applies to m edical professionals who are observers. The observer can be a different person from the collector and is not required to have any special training or certification s. The observer m ust follow the verbal instructions of the collector. T he reason for the direct observation m ust be explained to the em ployee. The observer must directly watch the urine stream go from the employee's bo dy to the co llection container. F). The collector does not take the employee's body tem perature, but immediately requires another collection under direct observation. The collector observes conduct or materials th at clearly in dicates an attem pt to s ubstitu te or adulte rate th e sample (e.g., substitutes urine in plain view, blue dye in specim en presented, etc.). In the follo wing circum stances the MRO will direc t the em ployer to have the employee immediately retes ted und er direct observation. The em ployer is required to comply with the MRO's request. Dilute Specimens. A dilute sp ecim en is a specim en with creatin ine and specific gravity valu es that are lo wer than ex pected for hum an urine. If th e test is reported as a dilute positive, the test should be treated as a verif ied pos itive test resu lt. If the tes t is reported as a negative dilute, the em ployer may, but is not required to direct the employee to take another test. The retest must not be conducted under direct observation. W hatever the em ployer's policy in this regard, all em ployees must be treated the sam e for this purpose and must be inform ed in advance of the retest policy. If the em ployer requires a retest following a negative dilute test resu lt, the retest must be conducted w ith no advance notice. T he result of the second test becom es the test of record and there is no opportunity for a third test, even if the second is also dilute. The laboratory reported to the MRO that a specim en was invalid, and the MRO determ ined that there was not an adequate m edical explanation for the resu lt; or The MRO had to cancel a tes t when the prim ary specim en was verified as positiv e, adu lterated, o r substitu ted because the split spec imen was unavailable f or testing (i.e., the sp lit specim en leaked, was lost, or inadvertently discarded). In the follo wing circum stance, the employer may authorize an observed colle ction : The em ployee has previously been determ ined to have used a controlled substance w ithout m edical authorization and the particular test is being conducted under the FTA regulation as a return-to-duty or follow-up te st. Section 3. LABORATORY TES TING The scientific techniques used in drug testing ar e virtually error-free when properly applied. The com bination of i mmunoassay screening with confirm ation by gas chrom atography/m ass spectrom etry (GC/MS) makes the possibility of error Previously, em ployers were allowed to conduct observed collections for tests following a previous dilute specim en. As of August 1, 2001, this practice was prohibited. Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-13 August 2002 All labo ratories that con duct drug te sts under the D OT-covered program must comply with both the D OT requirem ents set forth in Subpart F of Part 40, and the DHHS requirem ents. extrem ely remote. In the past, m ost errors in test resu lts were the res ult of hum an error in specim en handling, docum entation, or validity testing, all of which have been reduced in recent years by using detailed tes t protocols, scrutiny of testing regim es, and string ent qu ality control checks. Each transit system should enter into a contra ct for prim ary lab oratory serv ices tha t specifically states th e activities to be perform ed and the cost for such services. Transit system s should also enter into a contract with at least one additional laboratory f or split sam ple analysis and to serve as a backup in case problem s arise with the prim ary lab. The regulation does not specify whether the em ployer or the employee decides which DHHS-certified lab is used f or the split spec imen so it re mains a local d ecision. However, it he lps to identif y the possible labs in advance to m ake establishing custom er accounts and billing practices eas ier, whereas failure to do so in advance m ay result in testing delays and billing m istakes. Prior to finaliz ing th e contract with the laboratory, the DAPM and employee representative m ay want to personally inspect the laboratory. All drug testing under the FTA regulations must be completed in a laboratory certified by the DHHS u nder the National Laboratory Ce rtification Pr ogram (NLCP). These laboratories have been rigorous ly inspected an d tested and m eet the highest s tandards for an alytical competence. A list of DHHS-certified laboratories (current as of the date of publication of these guidelines) is provided in Appendix D. This list is updated on a m onthly basis and is printed in th e Federal R egister the first week of each m onth by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adm inistration (SAMHSA) . The list should be checked monthly as new laborat ories are added and others are removed. To verify the certification status of a laboratory, D HHS has also established a telephone HELPLINE at (800) 843-4971. The list is also maintained on the f ollowing W eb site: http://health.org/workplace. Specimen I nspection. The DOT regulation requires the lab to f irst ins pect each specimen and the C CF for fatal and correctab le flaws. If no fatal flaw exists, but correctab le flaws are fo und (see Section 5 of this ch apter), the lab m ust docum ent the flaw and take corrective action as defined in \u00a740.205. Validity Te sting. Specim en validity testing is the evalua tion of the specim en to determ ine if it is consiste nt with nor mal human urine or if cer tain adulterants or foreign substances were added to the urine, the ur ine wa s diluted, or the spec imen was substituted. At the tim e these Guidelines were publis hed, labor atories wer e permitted to conduct validity testing as part of the DOT testing process. As soon as the DHHS Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-14 August 2002 publishes its final ru le establishing the standards for determ ining the validity of urine specim ens under the Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Pro grams, it is a nticipated th at the DOT will make the va lidity testing of every specim en a m andatory portion of the drug testing process. Each prim ary specim en will be teste d for creatinin e, pH, and a dulterants. If the creatinine level is less th an 20 m g/mL, the specif ic gravity of the s pecim en will also b e measured. If the creatinine concentration is less than 20 mg/ mL and the spec ific gravity is less than 1.003, the specim en is considered d ilute. If the specim en is super dilute with a crea tinine concentr ation of less than or equ al to 5 m g/mL and the sp ecific gravity is less than or equal to 1.001 or greater than or equal to 1.020, the specim en is considered substitute, as the hum an body is incapable of providing a specim en with those quantifications. The rule doe s not spec ifically lis t the adulterants that will be tested for, but instead requires (\u00a740.91) that the laboratories test for substances identified and published by the DHHS. A specim en is considered to be adulterated when the specim en's physical characteristics are ou tside the norm al expected ran ge for hum an urine, a su bstance is pres ent th at is no t exp ected in hu man urine, or a s ubstance is present at concentrations so high that it is not consistent w ith hum an urine. Drug and Drug Metabolite Testing. The labora tory must test f or the f ollowing five drugs or their m etabolites using the testing protocols and m inimum cutoff thresholds defined in \u00a740.87: m phetam ine, and metham phetam ine). The initial tes t is an immunoassay test. If any prohibited drug or its m etabolite registers above the cutoff level on the imm unoassay screen, an aliquot of the sam e urine specim en must be confirm ed by using a technique called gas chrom atography/m ass spectrom etry (GC/MS). The initial te st resu lt is b ased on the ability of antibodies to recognize drugs in biological fluids. Imm unoassay tests, called screens, are sim ple to run and are often autom ated, and are r elatively inexp ensive. The confirmatory tests are m ore accurate, more tim e consum ing, r equire sophisticated laboratory equipm ent, and thus are more expensive than imm unoa ssay screens. The only conf irmatory test perm itted by 49 CFR Part 40 is G C/MS. Test Results. The laboratory m ay only report the te st resu lts to the designa ted Medical Review Officer (MRO). The test results will be reported to the MRO as negative, negative\u2014 dilute, positive, positiv e-dilute, adulter ated, substituted, or invalid. An invalid test is one where the urine specim en contains an unidentified adulterant or an uni dentified interfering substance, has abnorm al physical characteristics, or has an endogenous substance at an abnorm al concentration that prevents the laborator y from com pleting or obtaining a valid drug test result. The laboratory m ust confidentially transm it the test resu lts to the MRO in a timely m anner (i.e., the sam e day that the test resu lt is reviewed by the lab 's certifying scien tist). E xcept f or opiate pos itives with morphine or codeine levels at 15,000 ng/m L or above, test results will not be provided with quantitative v alues unless a sp ecific request is m ade by an MRO. Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-15 August 2002 Type of Drug or Metabolite Initial Test Cutoff Levels Confirmation Test Cutoff Levels (1) Marij uana Met abolites Metabolites (Benz oylecgonine) 300 150 (3) Phencyclidine (PCP) 25 25 (4) Am phetamines (i) Amphetamine (ii) Methamphetamine 1000 500 500a (5) Metabolites (i) Codeine (ii) Morphine orphine 2000 2000 10b Opiate levels above 15,0 00 ng/m L will b e autom atically reported b ecause the responsibilities of the MRO and e mployee change with opiate levels this high. In this case the burden of proof shifts to the employee to provide a verifiable m edical explanation for such high levels. Split Specimen Testing. The primary laboratory must provide secure sto rage for the split s ample f or 1 yea r if the pr imary specim en is positiv e, adu lterated, o r substituted. If directed by the MRO, the prim ary lab oratory shall f orward the split specim en bottle, with s eal intact, a copy of the MRO request, and a copy of the custody and control form to a different DHHS- approved laboratory. If the split sp ecimen is unavailable for testing, the lab m ust provide as much inform ation as possible to the MRO regarding the cause of the unavailability. In the c ase of a positive test re sult, th e second lab must test the specim en for the presence of the drug(s)or drug m etabolite independent of the cutoff levels. If the presence of the substance(s) is found, the prim ary test will be conf irmed positiv e. If the te st fails to reconf irm the pres ence of the drug/m etabolites tha t were repo rted p ositive by the prim ary lab, the second lab m ust conduct validity test ing on the split to determ ine if the spec imen was adulte rated o r substituted. If the sp lit does not reconfirm the pres ence of the drug/m etabolite a nd there is no evidence of adulteration or substitution, the resu lt will be repo rted to the MRO, the te st will b e cancelled, and the failure to rec onfirm will be repor ted to the DOT Office of Drug and Alcohol Policy and Compliance (ODAP C). Where a prim ary test res ult shows th e specim en was adulterate d or substituted, the second lab must test the split specimen in the sam e manner as th e primary to determ ine if the spec imen was adulte rated o r substituted. If the adulteration or substitution is found, the prim ary test result will be conf irmed. If not, the resu lt will be reported to the MRO, the test cancelled, and the failure to reconf irm will be repor ted to the ODAPC. If the split is unava ilable for testing and, therefore, cannot be us ed to reconfirm the prim ary test result, the p rimary test will b e cancelled an d the MRO will direc t the employer to have the em ployee retested under direct observation. Split specim en test results can only be reported to the MRO. Specimen S torage and Record Keeping. All confirm ed non-negative specim ens must be retained by the laboratory in long-term frozen storage for a minimum of 1 year. The laboratory must provide sem i-annual summation reports consistent w ith 49 CFR Part 40, Appendix B reporting requirem ents to each covered employer for whom they conduct testing. The summaries m ust be sent by January 20 a Specim en must also c ontain a mpheta mine at a concentration of greater than or equal to 200 ng /mL. b Test fo r 6-AM in the specim en. Cond uct this test only when specimen cont ains morphine at a conce ntration great er than or equal to 2000 ng/mL. Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-16 August 2002 for the preceding 6 m onths ending on Decem ber 31 and July 2 0 for the preceding 6 months ending on June 30. Employers or C/TPAs that have fewer than 2000 DOT-covered em ployees are not required to perform blind specim en testing. Section 4. MEDICAL REVI EW OFFICER The FTA regulation req uires that all drug testing laboratory results m ust be reviewed by a qualified MRO. The purpose of this review is to verify and validate test results. The MRO is to serve as an independent, impartial ga tekeeper resp onsible f or the accuracy an d integ rity of the drug testing process. As such, the MRO is required to perform the following functions (\u00a740.123): An MRO is defined in the regulation as a licensed physician responsible for receiving and reviewing laboratory results generated by an em ployer's drug testing program and evaluating m edical explanations for certain drug test results. The MRO m ust be knowledgeable about and have clinical experience in contro lled substance abuse disorders. T he MRO m ust have the appropriate m edical training to interpret and evaluate laboratory confirm ed positive test results and be knowledgeable about alternative m edical explanations for laboratory confirm ed test results. The MRO must be aware of issues relating to adulterated and substituted specim ens and possible m edical causes for invalid test results. Receive th e results of drug tests fro m the labo ratory. Conduct adm inistrativ e review of the CCF to ensure it is legib le, accurate, and signed by the laboratory's certif ying sc ientist. Che ck for fatal and correctable flaws. Take action to imm ediately correct correctable flaws. If appropr iate, th e MRO may request the laborato ry to analyze the original specim en again to verify the accuracy of the repo rted test resu lt. Provide feedback as appropriate to the DER and service ag ents regarding perform ance issues. Report m ajor problem s to the ODAPC and FTA as appropriate. As discussed in Chapter 5, MROs must know the DOT MRO Guidelines, Part 40 and applicable DOT agency rules (i.e., FTA Part 655). MROs m ust receive qualification training and com plete at least 12 hours of professional developm ent hours of continuing education that is relevant to MRO functions during each subsequent 3- year period. The MRO or his/h er staff m ust make at least three attem pts to contac t the employee spaced reason ably over a 24-hour period, including the day and evening using the telephone numbers listed on the C CF. All Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-17 August 2002 attem pts to c ontact the e must be docum ented. The MRO verif ication interv iew with the em ployee m ust be made by telephone or in person. The MRO must tell the employee that the tes t result was p ositive, adultera ted, substituted, or invalid and the basis for the test result (i.e., presence of drug or adulterant, or validity test results). The MRO m ust explain the verification process and the potential need for further m edical evaluation. The MRO must warn the em ployee before any m edical inform ation is discussed th at the MRO must disclose to third parties (i.e., employer, SAP, NTSB, DOT, FTA) without the em ployee's consent for drug test result inform ation and medical inform ation affe cting the performance of safety-se nsitive duties that the em ployee provides. If, after m aking a reasonable effort, the MRO is unable to reach the individual directly, the MRO shall contact the DER/DAPM. The DER should m ake at least three attem pts to contact the em ployee within a 24- hour period. If contact is m ade, the DER must instruct the employee to contact the MRO i mmediately (no longer than 72 hours) and explain the consequences of failing to do so. If the em ployee fails to co ntact the MRO within 72 hours, th e test will be verified as a no-contact positive. If, after m aking reasonable efforts for a 24-hour period, the DER is unable to co ntact the em ployee, th e employer may leave a message for the em ployee instructing him/her to contact the MRO and place the employee on tem porary unqualified status or m edical l eave. If 10 days pass with no em ployee contact, the MRO will verif y the test result as a no-conta ct positive. All attem pts to contact the employee m ust be docum ented. The MRO will review and inte rpret an confirm ed non- negativ e (i.e., positiv e, adulte rated, substituted, invalid) test by (1) reviewing the individual's m edical history, including any medical records and biom edical infor mation provided; (2) affording the individual an opportunity to discuss the test result; and (3) verifying the authenticity of all m edical records (i.e., prescriptions, m edical procedures) the em ployee provides. The MRO may contact th e employee's physician or other relevant m edical personnel for further inform ation. Based on the inform ation that was provided and verified, the MRO must decide whether th ere is a legitim ate medical explanation for the result, including legally prescribed m edication. If contact is m ade, the MRO m ust provide the em ployee with the opportunity to discus s the test result on a confidential basis. If the employee declines to discuss the test result with the MRO, the tes t will b e verif ied as a no-conta ct positiv e test result. If the em ployee wishes to talk to the MRO, the MRO staf f may schedule the interview, but m ust not gather any m edical inform ation or inform ation concerning possible explanations for the test result. The staff m ay advise an em ployee to have m edical inform ation ready to present to th e MRO. Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-18 August 2002 Chapter 7.

MRO Verification Fl owchart: Verification Process Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-21 August 2002 The MRO will verify the test result as either negative, positive, test cancelled, or test refused. Cancelled tests include invali d tests and tests with fatal flaws or uncorrected correctable flaws. Test refusals include adulterated and substituted tests. The MRO must report each verified test result and other relevant information to the DER in a timely and confidential manner. The employer must be notified of a verified positive, adulterated, or substituted test result immediately by telephone or other electronic means, so the employee can be removed from safety-sensitive duties immediately. The hard copy documentation of the test result provided by the MRO should follow later. The employer must not delay the removal of the employee from safety-sensitive duty while awaiting receipt of the hard-copy documentation of the test result. Likewise, removal of the employee from safety-sensitive duties must not be delayed pending the split specimen analysis. The MRO must notify each employee who has a verified non- negative test result that the employee has 72 hours in which to contact the MRO to request a test of the split specimen. The MRO must tell the employee how they can be contacted during the 72-hour period. The request may be verbal or in writing. If the employee requests an analysis of the split specimen within 72 hours of having been informed of a verified non-negative test, the MRO shall direct the laboratory, in writing, to ship the split specimen to another DHHS-certified laboratory for analysis. The split specimen test must be performed as soon as possible. The employee is not required to pay for the test before the test takes place. However, consistent with employer policy, the employer may seek reimbursement for the cost of the test once the test has been performed. If the analysis of the split specimen fails to confirm the presence of the drug(s) or drug metabolite(s) found in the primary specimen, or if the split specimen is unavailable or inadequate for testing, the MRO shall cancel the test and report the cancellation and the reasons for it to the DOT, the employer, and employee. If the split is unavailable for testing the MRO will direct the DER to send the employee for a retest under direct observation. If the employee has not contacted the MRO to request the split test within 72 hours of being notified of a verified positive drug test, the employee may present to the MRO information documenting that serious illness, injury, inability to contact the MRO, lack of actual notice of the verified positive test, or other circumstances that unavoidably prevented the employee from contacting the MRO in time. If the MRO concludes that there is a legitimate explanation for the employee's failure to contact the MRO within 72 hours, the MRO shall direct that the analysis of the split specimen be performed. If the MRO concludes that there is no legitimate explanation for the employee's failure to contact the MRO within 72 hours, then the Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-22 August 2002 MRO is not required to direct the analysis of the split specimen to be performed. The MRO must maintain all necessary records and protect the employee's privacy and testing program confidentiality. The MRO must confirm a positive test result for m arijuana, cocaine, am phetam ines, and/or phencyclidine unless the em presents a ate m edical the pres ence of the drug/m etabolite in his/her system. The burden of proof is on the em ployee to prov ide necessary docum entation of the m edical explanation. This information m ust be presented at the time of the verif ication interv iew with the MRO. If a valid m edical explanation is provided, the MRO m ust verify and report the test as negative. If not, the MRO m ust verify and report the test result as positive. If the laboratory reports a positive test result for opiates, the MRO m ust review the laboratory results to determ ine if 6- acety lmorphine (6-AM ) was present in the specim en: if so, the test must be verified positiv e. If 6-AM is not present, bu t the codeine or morphine levels are above 15,000 ng/m L, the burden of proof is on the employee to provide docum entation of a legitim ate medical explanation. If the concentrations are less than 15,000 ng/m L, the burden of proof is on the MRO to determ ine if there is c linical ev idence of illegal drug use. To accom plish this task, the MRO must conduct or require another physician to conduct a face-to -face exam ination of the em ployee. If no clinical evidence is found, the MRO m ust verify the test result as negative. If a specimen is determined by the laboratory to be adulte rated or substituted, the MRO will prov ide th e em ployee with the same opportunity to explain the test result as if it were po sitive. Thus , the MRO should explain the test results to the em ployee and offer the employee the opportunity to present a leg itimate m edical exp lanation f or the laboratory validity, or adulterant test result. In the case of an adulterated specim en, the em ployee has the burden of proof to demonstrate that the adulterant entered the specim en through physiological means. In the case of a substituted specim en, the em ployee must dem onstrate that he/she can produce a urine specim en through physiological m eans that has creatinin e and specific g ravity levels that fall within the criteria of a substitute specimen. If the explanation appears reasonable, the employee will hav e up to 5 days to undergo a medical exam ination by a qualified m edical phy sician, accep table to the MRO, to evaluate and consider any evidence that the em ployee pres ents. The evidence m ust be gathered using appropriate methodology and controls to ensure its accura cy an d reliability. The em ployee must dem onstrate th at the cited m edical condition actually results in the physiological production of urine m eeting the creatinine and specific gravity criteria. The MRO may change a verified test result (\u00a740.1 49) only if addition al inform ation is obtained from the e mployee, laboratory, or other s ource (e.g., prescribing physician) that im pacts the MRO's determ inatio n. The MRO has the so le authority under the regulation to m ake medical determ inations, and as such is the only one that m ay change a verified test result. An arbitrator or employer is not perm itted to overturn the m edical judgm ent of the MRO regarding whether there is a legitim ate medical explanation for a non- negative test result. The MRO may only cons ider test resu lts in the ve rification p rocess that wer e obtained in acco rdance with Part 4 0. Thus, res ults of tests conducted by othe r entities or tests using hair or blood specim ens cannot be used by the MRO. Likewise, DNA test results m ust be ignored. The MRO must not play a role in any disputes with the employer regarding the circum stances leading up to the test, nor should he/she be sym pathetic to employee assertions of inadvertent contact, unknowing use, or other explanations that do not constitute a legitim ate m edical use. The MRO cannot accept any explanations for the presence of phencyclidine or 6-AM in a specim en. Nor is it possible to have a urine specim en with bleach, soap, or glutaraldehyde or one without creatinine. MROs cannot take into consideration the use of marijuana under \"m edicinal m arijuana\" state laws that are not recognized by the DOT or the use of he mp products. Not all physicians have the specific clinical experience or knowledge necessary to becom e MROs. The basic knowledge requirem ents, qualifications training, and continu ing education req uirements will further lim it the ava ilability of MROs. However, there are a nu mber of MRO trade associations that offer the required training and cer tification prog rams to interes ted physicians. Each of these organizations offer listings of qualified MROs that could serve as a starting point when an agency tries to identify a new or replacem ent MRO. These organ izations are listed in the following ch art.

Review qualifications, medical licen se, m emberships, d ates of qualification training and subsequent continuing education training, and other relevant training and experience to ensure m inimum standard s are m et; 2. Have the MRO describe his or her methods for rem aining infor med of MRO policies and practices (e.g., attend ing co nferences, a ddition al training, m emberships, newsletters, etc.); 3. Check references for sim ilar work perform ed; 4. Assess ability to work with collection sites, testing laboratories, Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-23 August 2002 If the em ployer has an F TA-approved stand down policy (see discussion in Chapter 4 of these gu ideline s), the MRO m ust wo rk closely with the em ployer and the laboratory to work out reporting procedures, tim elines, and verification logistics. substance abuse professionals, and individual employees; assess the proposed method of notifying employees of verif ied po sitive test results and the m ethod used to afford employees the opportunity to discuss test resu lts; Section 5. CORRECTABLE AND FATAL FLAWS 5. Assess the a vailab ility a nd cost f or expert testimony for associated court cases; and Fatal Flaw s and Test Cancellations. Any tim e a service agent, em ployer, or other entity involved in the testing process becom es aware of an error in th e testing process, it m ust be docum ented. Most problem s that arise in the collection process are correctable following procedures established in \u00a740.205. However, there are four errors that canno t be corrected if they occur, and are not followed by a retest. DOT has identif ied th e following e rrors and omissions as \"fatal flaws \" that m ust result in a specim en being rejected by the laboratory (\u00a740.199). 6. If not based locally, have the MRO indicate ho w face-to-face m edical evaluations with em ployees will be conducted (i.e., an opiate positiv e, insufficient volum e) and how the MRO will coordina te with the DER/DAPM and local substance abuse professionals. When the services of an MRO have been retained, the em ployer should be sure to: Define procedures for disclosure of verified non -negative tes t resu lts to the em ployer, and the co nfidentia lity that is requ ired for m edical information not spec ifically related to the use of drugs; 1. Specim en identification num ber on the specim en bottle does not m atch the specim en identification num ber on the custody and control form . 2. Collector's printed name and signature are both missing from the custody and control form. Notif y the MRO of the specim en collection sites, laboratories, and SAPs used by the em ployer; 3. Prim ary specim en volum e is less than 30 m L and the split specim en cannot be re-designated as the prim ary specim en. Provide the MRO with copies of the employer's policy and procedures manual; Make sure the MRO has a copy of the regulations (49 CFR Parts 40 and 655) and the DOT MRO Guidelines; and 4. Specim en bottle seal is broken or shows evidence of tam pering and the split specimen cannot be re- designated as the prim ary specim en. Specify reporting procedures and record keeping requirements. In addition, the MRO must cancel a test when the f ollowing situa tions ex ist. In som e cases, as designated below, the MRO m ay Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-24 August 2002 2. The em ployee's s ignatu re is om itted from the cer tification s tatement and the \"em ployee refused to sign\" is not stated in the rem arks section. direct the D ER to have the em ployee sent for a rete st. 1. The test is reported as \"Invalid.\" The test m ust be cancelled and the employee must be retested under direct observation. 3. The certif ying scien tist's signatu re is omitted on a non-negativ e test resu lt from the lab oratory. 4. A non-DOT or an expired DOT custody and control form is used for a DOT collection when otherwise th e testing proc ess followed is in accordan ce with the DOT procedures. 2. The test is reported \"Rejected for Testing\" because of an uncorrected correctable flaw. A retest is not required. 3. The Prim ary is positive, but the sp lit fails to reco nfirm. A retest is no t required. Cancelled Tests. A cancelled tes t is neither positive nor negative. The cancelled test is to be treated as if the test never occurred. In situations w here a negative test result is required (i.e., pre-em ployment, return-to-duty, or follo w-up), another test must be perform ed. A c ancelled test does not count toward the em ployer's m inimum random test requirem ent. Additionally, a cancelled test does not provide a valid basis for an em ployer to conduct a non-DOT test under com pany authority. 4. The prim ary specim en is adulterated or substitu ted and the sp lit fails to reconfirm . A retest is not required. 5. The prim ary specim en is positiv e, adulterated, or s ubstituted and the split spec imen is unava ilable. A retest is required under direct observation. 6. The exam ining physician indicates that there is a legitim ate m edical explanation for insufficient volum e. A retest is n ot requ ired. If the specim en tem perature on the CCF was not checked and there is no entry regarding the tem peratur e being out of range in the Rem arks sec tion o f the f orm, corrective action m ust be taken, but the error is not sufficient to cancel a drug test. Correctable Flaw s. Other errors m ay occur in the testing process that do not impact the accuracy of the tes t; therefore, they can be corrected. When the laboratory identifies a correctable flaw, the labo ratory must m ake every attem pt to correct th e problem following the procedures outlined in \u00a740.205. A correctable flaw that is not corrected will result in a cancelled test. Correctable flaws includ e: No person m ay declare a tes t cancelled based on an error that does not have a significant adverse effect on the right of the employee to have a fair and accurate test. Mistak es that do not resu lt in a cancelled te st and do not require corrective action include the followin g: 1. Minor adm inistrative m istakes such as om itting an iddle 1. The the ce rtification sta tement on the CCF. Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-25 August 2002 2. An error that does not affect employee protections, such as the failure to add bluing agent to the toilet bowel; 3. Collection o f the specim en by a collector that has not m et the training requirem ents; 4. A delay in the collection process; 5. Verification of a test result by an otherwise qualified MR O who has not m et the train ing requ irements; 6. Failure to perform an obs erved or monitored collection when one is required, or perform ing an unauthorized collection; 7. Use of a facility that do es not m eet the m inimum requirem ents; 8. Omission of courier name on the CCF; 9. Inadvertent inclusion of personal inform ation on the CCF; or 10. Claim s that the em ployee was improperly selected for testing. Section 6. EMPLOYER RESPONSIBILITI ES Employers are responsible for ensuring that a ll aspects of the drug testing program comply with 49 CFR Par t 40. Even though employers m ay hire one or m ore service agents to per form the testing f unction s, the employer cannot delegate the responsibility for com pliance. An FTA recipient or subrecip ient whose service agents do not meet or who violate applicable requirem ents and procedures of Part 40, m ay be deem ed out of com pliance and su bject to losing their FTA funding. All written or unwritten contracts, agreem ents, or arrangements with s ervice agents concerning the provision of DOT drug and alcohol testing services are deem ed, as a m atter of law, to require compliance with all applicable DOT and FTA drug and alcohol testing regulations (\u00a740.11). Employer Actions. With th e publication of the new DOT rule on the Procedures f or Transportation W orkplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Program s (49 CFR Part 40), the wide range of test results and corresponding em ployer actions have been clearly defined and standardized. Figure 7-3 is provided on page 7-28 as a quick reference of test results and subsequent em ployer actions. For f urther explanation, the regula tory text should be consulted. Once an employer is notified by the MRO of a verified positive, adulterated, or substituted test result, the em ployer must immediately rem ove the em ployee fr om safety-sensitive job duties. The em ployer must not wait f or the wr itten repor t from the MRO or the test resu lt from the split specim en. The em ployee cannot be returned to saf ety-sensitive duty u ntil the em ployee has succes sfully com pleted the return -to- duty process as defined further in Chapter 9 of these guidelines. If an em ployee's test result is negative dilute, the employer m ust determ ine if a retest is required as defined in the employer's policy statem ent. If the MRO reports the test result as invalid, the employer must imm ediately send the Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-26 August 2002 employee for a retest under direct observation without any advance notice. The em ployer cannot add any additional consequences to an invalid test. If a test is cancelled w hen a negative tes t is req uired (i.e., pre-em ploym ent, return-to-duty, follow-up), the em ployer m ust send the employee back for another test, not under direct observation. The em ployer is not allowed to a lter a drug te st resu lt once the result has been verified by the MRO. Chapter 7.

Drug Testing Procedures 7-30 August 2002 Collection Site Checklist (To be used by Speci men Collection Pers onnel) 1. Record the employee's arrival tim e at the co llection site. Notif y the trans it agency if the employee fa ils to repo rt or arrives late. 2. Prepare the collection site. Ensu re that all collection supplie s are available, the area is properly secured, water sources are s ecured, and bluing agen t has been placed in the toilets. 3. Begin the test without undue dela y. If an alcohol breath test is to be perform ed, conduct it prior to collecting the ur ine spec imen. 4. Verify the identity of the em ployee through the use of an offi cial picture identification or verification by a transit offici al. Provide a copy of your id entification if the em ployee requests you to do so. 5. Explain th e collection p rocess to the em ployee a nd review the instructi ons on the back of the CCF with the em ployee. 6. Check to see if the inform ation provided in St ep 1 of the CCF is accu rate: specim en ID number, laboratory name and address, em ploye r's nam e, address, telephone and fax num ber, MRO na me, address, telephone and fax num ber; employee ID num ber; reason for the test; test to be perform ed; and collection site inform ation. 7. Request that the em ployee check h is/her bel ongings, includ ing unnecessary outer garm ents, purses, and briefcases. The em ployee m ay retain his/her wallet. If the employee requests it, provide a receipt for his/ her personal belongings. 8. Direct the employee to em pty hi s or her pockets and display the item s. Assess the item s to ensure th at no item s are presen t that could be used to adulte rate the specim en. If nothing is present, the em ployee should be al lowed to return the item s to his/her pockets. Refusal to empty one's pockets con stitutes a tes t refusal. If an item is id entified a s a potential adulterant, but appears to be inadvertently br ought to the site, secure the item and continue with the test. If the it em appears to be brought to the site with the intent to adulterate the specim en, a direct observation co llection should be conducted. 9. Request the em ployee to rinse his/he r hands with water and dry them . 10. Provide the em ployee with a specim en bottle or allow him /her to choose one and direct him/her to the privacy enclosure. Instruct th e employee to provide a specim en of at least 45 mL. Also, advise the employee not to flush, a nd to re turn th e specim en to the collec tor as soon as possible so that the tem perature of th e specim en can be checked. Do not enter the enclosure. You should not observe the spec imen collection unless special circum stances exist. You m ay set a reasonable tim e lim it for the em ployee to be inside the privacy enclosur e. Notif y the e mployee of the tim e lim it. 11. If the em ployee refuses to provide a specim en, or otherwise f ails to cooperate with the process, inform the e mployer and docum ent the refusal on the custody and control form. Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-31 August 2002 Collection Site Checklist (cont.) (To be used by Speci men Collection Pers onnel) 12. After you receive the specim en, check the specim en temperature as soon as possible, but no more than 4 m inutes after the em ployee hands you the specimen. Check the specim en volum e, and inspect the specim en for evidence of adulteratio n or substitution. If the temperature of the specim en is outside the acceptable range (90.0 \u00b0to 100.0 \u00b0F), require the employee to provide another specim en under direct observation. If the te mperature is within range and everything else appears satisfactory, check the appropriate boxes on Step 2 of the CCF regarding tem perature a nd the type of collection. 13. If there is an y reason to s uspect adu lteration or su bstitu tion, require the employee to p rovide another specim en under direct observation. 14. Break the seals on the specim en bottles and pour the first 30 mL of urine from the collection container into the prim ary specim en bottle. Pour the rem ainder (a t least 15 mL) into the split specim en bottle. 15. Rem ove the tam per-evid ent seals fro m the CCF and place them on each bottle. The \" A\" label should be placed on the prim ary specim en and \"B\" label should be p laced on the split specim en. The seal should be centered over th e lid/cap and down the si des of the bottle to ensure the lid/cap cannot be rem oved without destroying the seal. W rite the date on the seals. Requ est th e em ployee to in itial the seals attach ed to th e bottle. 16. To the greatest extent possible, keep the specim ens in your a nd the em ployee's view prior to sealing and labeling the specim en. 17. Direct the employee to read, sign, and date the certific ation statem ent and provide the date of birth, printed nam e, and day and evening contact telephone num bers in Step 5 of Copy 2 of the CCF. 18. Com plete th e collecto r's portion of the CCF, ensure that all copi es of the CCF are legible and complete, and package the specim en along with Copy 1 of the CCF in the plastic bag, and prepare the specim en for shipm ent. Provide C opy 5 of the CCF to the em ployee and then excuse him /her. 19. Send Copy 2 of the CCF to the MR O, Copy 4 to the DER, and m aintain Copy 3 at the collection site for at least 30 days.. The specim ens and CCF must be shipped within 24 hours or the next business day. Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-32 August 2002 Employee Specim en Collection Checkli st (For Employees Required to Provide Urine Specimens for Drug Testing) 1. Report to the specim en collecti on site as soon as possible af ter receiving notification. Refusal to report for collection within the ti meframe defined by your em ployer or refusal to cooperate with th e collection p rocess will be con sidered a tes t refusal. 2. Show the collection site personnel an official photo identification card. 3. Check your outer garm ents with the collection site personnel fo r safekeeping. You have the right to retain your wallet and to ask for a r eceipt for your belongings. Display your pocket contents to the collector. Allow the collector to secure any unacceptable item s with your other belongings. 4. Rinse and dry your hands. 5. Obtain or observe the collector obtaining a wr apped specim en container and break or watch the collector break th e seal on the collection container. 6. Proceed to the privacy enclosure and provide a s pecim en in the collectio n contain er. At leas t 45 m L of urine are required for analysis. Do not flush the to ilet. Return the specim en to the collector as soon as possible af ter completing the void. If an insufficient am ount of urine is provided, th e orig inal sp ecim en will be discar ded and you will be given u p to 3 hours and allowed to consum e not more than 40 ounces of fluids to provide another specim en. Do not tamper with the spec imen or m ake substitu tions. The specim en will be visually insp ected f or unusual color and sedim ent. 7. The tem perature of the s pecim en will be m easured and m ust fall within an acceptable range. If the tem perature falls o utside the acceptab le range, you will be required to provide an other specim en under direct observation. If the co llector notices any signs of adulteration, substitution, or tam pering with the specim en, the collector will require you to provide another specim en under direct observation. Refu sal to cooperate with the request for a new colle ction u nder dir ect o bservation will be de emed a test re fusal. 8. Give the specim en to the specim en collecti on personnel and watch the collector break the seal on the s pecim en bottles, pou r the specim en into the p rimary and split specim en bottles, seal and label them . Initial the labels verifying that the specim en is yours. 9. Read, sign, and date the certificat ion statem ent, and provide your date of birth, printed nam e, and day and evening contact telephone num bers in Step 5 of Copy 2 of the CCF. 10. You m ay wish to indicate on the back of your copy (Copy 5) of the custody and control form any m edications you are currently using. This li st may serve as a m emory jogger in the event a Medical R eview Officer calls you to discuss the results of your te st, but this is not required. Do not put any personal inform ation on any other copy of the CCF. 11. Watch the c ollector com plete the co llecto r's portion of the CCF and place the specimen bottles and Copy 1 of the CCF inside the leak-resistant plastic pouch. Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-33 August 2002 12. You m ay now wash your hands and the collecto r will ins truct you that the collection p rocess is over and you m ay leave. The results of the laboratory analysis will be forwarded to your employer's MRO. If the results are negativ e (no drugs detected), the MR O will notif y your employer. If the laboratory confirms a positive result (drugs detected), or as adulterated or substituted s pecim en, the MRO will contact you at the telepho ne num ber you provided to give you the opportunity to discuss the test resu lts and to subm it infor mation dem onstrating a medical explanation for the test results. Chapter 7. Drug Testing Procedures 7-34 August 2002 Instructions for Completing the Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form A.

ALCO HOL TES TING PROCEDURES The FTA regulation (49 CFR Part 655) requires that you conduc t breath alcohol testing on safety-sensitive em ployees consistent w ith 49 CFR Part 40, Subparts J through N. The alcohol test consists of an initial scre en test, that if not negativ e, is followed by a confirm atory test. A breath alcohol test m easures the alcohol in a volum e of breath expressed in term s of gram s of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Alcohol is the intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or other low molecular w eight alcohols. The test measures the concentration of alcoh ol regardless of its source. Thus, it will detect alcohol consum ed as a beverage, candy, food, m edicine, or other product where the quantity of alcohol results in a breath alcohol concentrati on above the m inimum cut-off levels. Only saliva and breath tests using approved devices are authorized by the DOT for alcohol screen tests, and only breath tests are authorized for confirm atory alcohol tests. Urine and blood tests are not allow ed for DOT covered alcohol tests. The FTA regulation (\u00a740.23) prohibits any em ployer from allowing an employee with an alcohol con centration of 0.04 or greater to p erform any safety-sensitiv e duties until he/she has been evalu ated by an SAP and has passed a return-to-duty test. An e mployee with an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, must be rem oved from duty for 8 hours or until a retest shows an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02. Section 1. ALCOHOL TESTING DEVICES The initial screen test m ay be conducted using an evidential breath testing device (EBT) or a n on-eviden tial alcoho l screen device (ASD) using breath or saliva. The confirm atory test can only be conducted using an EBT. Alcohol Screen Devices (ASD) (\u00a740.3). An ASD is a breath or saliva device, other Chapter 8. Alcohol Testing Procedures 8-1 August 2002 The Confor ming Products List (CP L) of EBT devices that was current as of the date of this docum ent's publication is provided in the Sam ple Docum entation sec tion o f this chapter. When viewing the CPL, special note should be m ade that only those devices listed without an as terisk (*) are authorized for use in confirm atory alcohol testing under the DOT alcohol testing program . NHTSA will occ asionally p rint updates to the ir CPL of EBTs in the Federal Register. This list can be found at: www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/alcohol/blood. htm. than an EBT, that is approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Adm inistration (NHTSA) and placed on a confor ming products list (CPL) for such devices. At the tim e of publication, the CPL had 16 testing devices that had been approved as ASDs. Two of these were saliva tests and 14 were non-evidential breath tests. ASDs m ay only be operated by trained and qualified Screen Test Technicians (STT). Only ASDs on the NHTSA confor ming products lists that have instru ctions f or them included in Part 40 may be used to conduct DOT alcohol screening tests (\u00a740.229). An ASD can only be used for a screen test and m ay not be used for a confirm atory test. For confirmation tests, EBTs must be able to : Print e ach te st resu lt in tr iplicate o r three consecutive identical copies; Evidential Breath Testing Device (EBT) (\u00a740.231). An EBT is a device that measures an em ployee's alcohol concentration. It m ust be able to distinguish alcohol fro m acetone at the 0.02 alcohol concentration level. EB Ts m ust be capable of conducting air blank tests and external calibration checks, and they m ust be approved by NHTSA and operated by qualified and trained Breath Alcohol Technicians. Assign a unique num ber to each completed test, a llow th e BAT and the em ployee to read the num ber before each test, and print the number on each copy of the resu lt; Print on each copy of the result the manufacturer's nam e for the device, the device's serial num ber, and the time of the test; Distinguish alcohol from acetone at the 0.02 alcohol concentration level; Test air blanks; and Perform external calibration checks. Each EBT device m ust have a manufacturer-developed quality assurance plan approved by NHTSA (\u00a740.233). The plan m ust include the following: A designated m ethod or m ethods to perform external calibration checks of the device; Chapter 8. Alcohol Testing Procedures 8-2 August 2002 Specified m inimum intervals for perform ing extern al calibration checks that account for different frequencies of use, environm ental conditions (e.g., tem perature, altitude, hum idity), and contexts of operation (e.g., stationary or m obile use); Specified to lerances on an extern al calib ration c heck within which the EBT is regarded to be in proper calibration; and Specified inspection, m aintenance, and calibration requirements and intervals for the device. The regulation specifically requ ires that the em ployer com ply with the NHTSA- approved quality assurance plan by ensuring that the external calib ration checks of each EBT are perfor med as describ ed in the manufacture r's plan and that the EBT will be taken out of service if any external calib ration c heck resu lts in a reading outside the to leran ces for the device. The E BT cannot be p laced back in to serv ice un til it has been repaired and has had an acceptable extern al calibration check. The em ployer must also ensure that the inspection, maintenance, and calibration of each EBT is perform ed by the m anufacturer or a maintenance repres entative cer tified by the device's m anufacturer or an appropriate state agency . The em ployer m ust als o maintain rec ords of the e xterna l calibration checks of th e EBT and store the EBT in a secure place when not being used. If the employer delegates these duties to a service agent, the employer rem ains responsible for ensuring that thes e requ irements are m et. Provisions should be m ade for a backup EBT for ti mes when the prim ary EBT is unavailable, out of calibration, or being serviced. You could acquire a second instrum ent, arrange for a \"loaner,\" or arrang e to u se another transit agency or DOT em ployer's EBT when necess ary. Other DOT em ployers m ight include school bus agencies, trucking companies, airlines, railroads, city/county public works departm ents, etc. Section 2. ALCOHOL TESTING PERSONNEL Screen Tes t Technicians (STT) and Breath Alco hol Technicians (BAT) are the only people authorized to conduct DOT alcohol tests. STTs m ay conduct screen tests only, whereas a BAT can conduct both screen tes ts and conf irmatory tests. Screen Test Technician (40.213). To serve as an STT, an individual m ust have basic knowledge about the alcohol testing process as specified in 49 CFR Part 40 and current DOT alcohol testing program guidance m aterials. The STT m ust have qualif ications training th at follows th e DOT Model STT course, or an equivalent. The STT must dem onstrate proficiency in following th e alcoho l testing procedures and in the operation of the alcohol screen device that he /she will be us ing. Prof icien cy will be dem onstrated by com pleting five consecutive error-free m ock tes ts under the direct observation and scrutiny of a qualified monitor. If the alcohol screen device that the STT will be using indicates readings by changes, contrasts, or other readings in color, the S TT m ust demonstrate as part of the proficiency dem onstration that he/she is able to discern the changes, contrasts, or readings correctly. STTs are required to undergo refresher training every 5 years and error correction training anytim e a mistak e results in a cancelled test. See Chapter 5 for a more detailed discussion of the STT training requirem ents. Chapter 8. Alcohol Testing Procedures 8-3 August 2002 Breath Alcohol Technician (\u00a740.213). Breath alcoh ol techn icians m ust know the alcohol testing rule a nd the alcohol testing program guidance m aterials published by the DOT Office of Drug and Alcohol Policy and Co mpliance (ODAPC). These m aterials can be obtained at www.dot.gov/ost/dapc. BATs m ust receive qua lifications training that is in a ccordance with the DOT Model BAT course, and be \"trained to proficiency\" in the ope ration of the EBT he/she will b e using as well as the alcohol testing procedures specified in the regulation. The DOT Model course or equivalent must provide training in th e principles of EBT methodology, operation, and calibration checks. In addition, the BAT must com plete training on the funda mentals of breath analysis for alcohol content, the procedures required for obtaining a breath specim en, and interpreting and recording EBT results. The BAT must dem onstrate com petence in the operation of the specific EBT he/she will use. Pr oficiency de monstration s must include seven consecutiv e error-free mock collections perform ed before a qualif ied monitor. Th e BAT will also be r equired to receive refresher training every 5 years and error-correction training anytim e a mistak e results in a cancelled test. See Chapter 5 for a more detailed discussion of the BAT training requirem ents. If one BAT is selected as the prim ary EBT operator, provisions should be m ade for backup services. Each BAT/STT is required to m aintain docum entation showing that he/she h as succes sfully et all th e requirem ents. This docum entation must be made available to em ployers and DOT representatives upon request. Em ployers should periodically check their service agent's reco rds to ensu re that the m inimum training and proficiency dem onstration requirem ents are being m et. The imm ediate or direct supervisor of an employee cannot serve as the BAT or STT for that em ployee's tes t. Law enforcem ent officers who have been certified by state or local governm ents to conduct breath alcohol tests on the EBT or ASD that was used for the test are deem ed to be qualified as BATs and are not required to com plete the DOT training r equirements. I f local law enforcem ent agencies will be us ed to conduct alcohol testing services under the DOT regulations, the alcohol testing devices utilized sho uld be check ed agains t the NHTSA confor ming products list to determ ine if they qualify as EBTs. Section 3. ALCOHOL TESTING SITES Alcohol Testing Site (\u00a740.221). Alcohol test sites shoul d provide visual and aural privacy. The alcohol test can be perform ed in a m edical facility, em ployer's facility, a mobile colle ction facility (e.g., a van equipped for alcohol testing) or any other facility m eeting the privacy requirem ents. EBTs and ASDs can be purchased and operated directly by the transit system or any service agent wil ling to perform breath testing services. If possible, alcohol tests should be perform ed at the sam e location used to co llect urine for drug tests. By conducting the alcohol and drug tests in the same location, the tim e and logistical Chapter 8. Alcohol Testing Procedures 8-4 August 2002 problem s associated with the collection process will be m inimized when an employee will b e taking both an alco hol and a drug tes t. Rem ember, in instances where a drug and alcohol test will both be conducted, the alcohol test is to be perform ed first and without undue delay. Recommend ation Locating Rural Alcohol Te sting Sites The number , location, and availability of alcohol breath testing services may be li mited, especially in very rural areas. Employers who are experiencing diffi culty finding alcohol testing sites may wish to joi n forces with other transportation employers in y our region to purchase EBT and BAT services as a group (see Chapter 11,\"Joining a Consortium).\" Transportation employers may include transit system s, trucking firms, school bus o perations, or o ther agencies that have drivers holding CDLs. In very rural areas, some transit agencies conduct their own initi al screens using inexpensive s aliva ASDs, and then using local law enforcement agencies to conduct confirmatory tests using their EBTs. This arrangement is less expensive for the transit syste m because they need not purchase or maintain an EBT. Yet, it i s not a burde n on the local law enforcem ent agency since they will be called upon on only in the rare event that the initial screen indicates a breath alcohol co ncentration of 0.02 or greater. This approach wil l only work if the local law enforcement agency agrees and the confirmatory test can be performed within 30 minutes of the scr een test. This metho d shoul d be i mplemented with caution to av oid any perce ption of testing as a \"police\" action. However , where there are no alternative s, use of local law enforcement agencies may be the only w orkable optio n. In unusual circum stances (e.g., accident, reasonab le suspicion ) when an alcoh ol testing site m eeting th ese requirem ents is not available, th e alcoho l test can be con ducted in a m anner that provides the em ployee with privacy to th e grea test ex tent p ractica ble (i.e., back of a supervisor's car at an acciden t scene). Testing s ites must have the necess ary personnel, m aterials, equipm ent, and facilities to conduct the te st. The testing site must prevent unauthorized individuals from entering the testing area. The only people who should be authorized to enter the testing site are the employees being tested, B ATs, STTs, and other alcohol testing site workers, DERs, and DOT agency repres entatives. Employee representatives should be allowed to enter only if authorized by the employer's policy or labor m anage ment agreem ent. Anyone entering the site must be supervised by the BAT/STT, and he/she m ay be removed f rom the site an ytime the BAT/STT believ es the individua l is obstructing, interferi ng with, or causing unnecessary delays in th e testing process. No one other than the BAT/STT, e mployee, and/or DOT agency rep resentative m ay actually witness the testing process. Any e mployer, new or existing, that needs to es tablish a lcoho l testing s ervices within its se rvice area sh ould consid er the following procedures for identifying potential vendors: The EBT and ASDs m ust be stored in a secure place when not in use. The site m ust be secured with no unauthorized access at any tim e the EBT is unsecured or when testing is occurring. The BAT m ust conduct only one test at a tim e and m ust not leave the te sting site while the prepar ation s for testing or th e test itself are in progress. 1. Develop specifications for EBT/ASD and BAT/STT services consistent with 49 CFR Part 40. Estim ate the number and types of tests to be perform ed throughout the year. Specify the hours of required Chapter 8. Alcohol Testing Procedures 8-5 August 2002 availability and the need for backup equipm ent and trained personnel. 2. Confer with other em ployers in your region who must purchase alcohol testing services to satisfy DOT regulations. Determ ine how these employers are m eeting the requirem ent for testing. Identify potential co ntract ors and consortia (private and public) for testing services. 3. Investigate the current and potential availability of EBT/ASD and BAT/STT servic es in th e loca l community and evaluate the level of interest in the provision of testing services. 4. Select an alcohol co llection site. If possible, the alcohol specim en collection site should be the sam e as the drug specim en collection site. 5. Develop a contract that specifies the obliga tion o f the colle ction site to maintain equipm ent quality standards and BAT/STT qualifications, refresher, and error- correction training consistent with 49 CFR Part 40 throughout the duration of the contract. Require that sufficient records of the quality control m easures, equipm ent calibration, and training be provided for docum entation. Section 4. ALCOHOL BREATH TES TING PRO CESS The following procedures m ust be used to conduct the alcohol breath test: Preparation (\u00a740.241). Upon arrival at the alcohol collection site, the em ployee must check in to have his/her arrival tim e noted. If the em ployee arrived late as determ ined by the em ployer, the B AT/STT must notify the DER i mmediately and follow the DER's instru ctions. A la te arriv al may be cons idered a test refusal. As soon as the em ployee arrives at the testing site, the testing process should begin without undue delay. If both a drug and alcohol test are to be perfor med, the alcohol test is to be conducte d first unless practical considerations warrant otherwise. T he process is not to be delayed to await an employer or em ployee representative. The em ployee m ust provide positive identificatio n to the BAT/STT. The identification can be a com pany photo identificatio n card or a photo identification card is sue b y a federal, s tate, o r local governm ent (e.g., driver's license). F axes and photocopies of identification will not be accepted. Positiv e iden tification by an official em ployer representative (e.g., superviso r) is accep table. If the em ployee does not produce the proper identification, the BAT/STT m ust contact th e DER to verif y the id entity of the em ployee. The BAT/STT will explain the tes ting procedure to the em ployee and show him/her the instructions on the back of the alcohol testing for m. The new Alcohol Testing Form, (ATF) printed as Appendix G of Part 40, must be used for all DOT covered alcohol tests perfor med since February 1, 2002. Only the DOT ATF can be used for a DOT alcohol test. The DOT ATF cannot be used for non-DOT alcohol tests. A copy of the ATF is provided in the Sample Docum entation section of this chapter. Chapter 8. Alcohol Testing Procedures 8-6 August 2002 The BAT/STT com pletes Step 1 of the ATF by f illing in the inf ormation re garding the em ployee, em ployer, DER and reason for the tes t. The em ployee is d irected to complete Step 2 of the ATF and sign the certification. If the em ployee refuses to sign the ce rtification in Step 2 of the proce ss, it will be con sidered a test ref usal, th e test will be halted, an d the DER will be no tified immediately. Screen Tests. The scre en test will b e given with an EBT or ASD. If an EBT or non-evidential breath testing device is used (\u00a740.243), an individually wrapped mouth piece will be selected by the BAT/STT or the em ployee. The m outhpiece will be attached to the device, and the em ployee will be instr ucted to b low forcefully into th e mouthpiece for 6 seconds, or until th e device indicates that a sufficient am ount of breath has been obtained. The displayed result will be shown to the em ployee. The test results will be recor ded on the ATF. If a saliv a ASD is used for the screen test (\u00a740.24 5), the STT will check the expiration date on the device and show it to the em ployee. The pack age will b e opened in the p resence of the employee, and the STT will of fer the d evice to the em ployee, instru cting h im/her to ins ert it in to his /her mouth until it becom es satura ted with saliv a. If the test does not ac tivate, or the employee chooses not to use th e device, th e STT will insert the device into the em ployee's mouth and gather the saliva. Upon rem oval of the device f rom the m outh, the STT will check to see if the device was activated. If so, the STT will await the appro priate tim e defined by the m anufacturer and then read th e result displayed. In all cases, the result m ust be read within 15 m inutes of the test. T he STT will show th e result to th e em ployee and enter the r esult on th e ATF. If the te st cannot be completed, one reattem pt is allowed. If the reattem pt is not successful, the em ployee m ust be directed to take a new test imm ediately using an EBT. Confirmation Test (\u00a740.251). If the result of the screen test is an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02, no further testing is req uired, and th e BAT/STT will report the re sult to the D ER as a negative test. The employee m ay then return to his/her safety-sensitive position. If the result of the screen test is an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a confirm ation test m ust be perform ed. The confirmation test m ust be conducted at least 15 m inutes, but not m ore than 30 minutes, after the com pletion of the screen test. Th is delay prev ents any accum ulation of alcohol in the m outh from leading to an artificially high read ing, as any residual amount of al cohol left in the m outh will dissipate prior to the confirm ation test. Chapter 8. Alcohol Testing Procedures 8-7 August 2002 At the conclusion of the screen test, the BAT/STT will inf orm the em ployee of the need to conduct a confirm ation test and instruct the em ployee not to eat, drink, or put any object or substance in his or her mouth. The BAT/STT w ill also instr uct the employee not to belch to the extent possible while awaiting the conf irmation test. The BAT/STT must inform the em ployee why the waiting period is needed and that while it is in th e employee's b est interes t to follow the ins tructions, the test will be cond ucted a t the end of the waiting period, even if they are disregarded. If more than 30 m inutes have elapsed since the time of the screen tes t, the cause for the delay m ust be docum ented, but the test rem ains valid. Before the c onfirmation test is administered, the BAT shall conduct an air blank on the EBT in the presence of the employee. If the reading is greater th an 0.00, the BAT shall conduct one m ore air blank. If the second air blank reading is greater than 0.00, the EBT m ust not be used to conduct the test. The confirmation test is conducted using the sam e procedures as the screening test. A new m outhpiece will be used and ins erted into th e EBT. The em ployee will b e instru cted to blow f orcefully in to the mouthpiece for at least 6 seconds, or until the device in dicates it has an adequate breath sam ple. The result on the display must be shown to the employee. The result and unique test num ber that the EBT prints out m ust also be shown to the em ployee. The BAT wi ll sign and date the form . If the test result is less than 0.02, the test is over, the employer will be given his/her copy of the ATF, and the em ployee will be dism issed. If the test result is 0.02 or above, the BAT will instruc t the employee to sign and date the certification statem ent on Step 4 of the ATF (It is not a test ref usal if the employee refuses to sign Step 4 of the ATF). The BAT will imm ediate ly transm it the results direc tly to the D ER so the e mployee can be imm ediately rem oved from safety- sensitive du ties. The BAT will attach the alcohol test result prin tout directly onto the ATF with tamper eviden t tape (unle ss the results are p rinted directly on the form ). If the initia l and conf irmatory test res ults are different, the confirm ation test result is deem ed to be the final result. An employer cannot take action against an em ployee under these regulations f or a positive screen test (i.e., 0.040 or greater) when the confirmatory test resu lt is nega tive ( i.e., 0.039 or less ). If the alcohol tes t is positive, the em ployer should m ake arrangements to drive the employee from the collectio n site to avoid liab ility. Reporting. The BAT will transm it all results to the DER c onfidentially (in writing, in person, by telephone, or other electronic means). In the event an individual must be removed from safety-sen sitive duties (0.02 or above or test refu sal), the BAT will notify Chapter 8. Alcohol Testing Procedures 8-8 August 2002 The DOT and the FTA do not require pre-em ploym ent alcohol testing. H owever, if a DOT covered agency chooses to perform pre-em ploym ent alcohol testing, it may do so a s long as the DOT testing procedures are followed. (\u00a7655.41). Applicants who do not appear for a pre- employm ent alcohol test or leave the colle ction site pr ior to c ommencem ent of the alcohol testing process are not deemed to have refused a pre-em ploym ent alcohol test. the em ployer's repres entative imm ediately. The DER must have a m echanism to estab lish the identity of the BAT when test results or o ther conf idential information is provided over the phone or electronically (e.g., passw ord). The E BT will pro duce a printou t of the tes t resu lts in tr iplica te or print three consecutive identical cop ies of the resu lts. The three copies of the printout will be a ttached to each of the three copies of the ATF. Copy 1 m ust be retained by the BAT, Copy 2 m ust be provided to the employee, and Copy 3 must be tran smitted to the em ployer. Insufficient Volume (\u00a740.263; \u00a740.265). If an e mployee attem pts and fails to provide enough breath, the BAT must instru ct the em ployee to make anoth er attem to pr ovide a suf ficient b reath specim en. The BAT should provide additional instruction on the technique that should be followed and coach the em ployee through the process. If the second attem pt is unsuccessful, the BAT may provide another opportunity to the em ployee to provide a specim en if the BAT believes it is lik ely tha t the next attempt would be successful. Test Refusal (\u00a740.261). Similar to drug testing, there are a num ber of behaviors defined in the regulati on that con stitute an alcohol test refusal. These are listed below. Failur e to ap pear f or the test within the tim eframe defined by the em ployer. Failur e to remain at the testing site un til the testing proc ess is complete. If the individual is still unable to provide a sufficient breath sp ecim en, the BAT m ay attem pt to o perate the E BT in m anual m ode, or they m ay use a saliva ASD, if available. If attem pts are still unsuccessful, the BAT/STT will contac t the DER and note the insufficient volum e on the ATF. The employer must then inform the e mployee that he/she has 5 days to obtain a m edical evaluation from a licensed physician to determ ine if the insuf ficient volum e had a valid m edical explanation. Failure to attem pt to provide a specim en. Failure to provide sufficient breath with no valid m edical explana tion f or the inab ility to provide the required specim en. Failure to undergo a m edical exam ination associated with insufficient volum e procedures. Failur e to sign the ce rtification on Step 2 of the ATF. Failur e to co operate with the colle ction p rocess. The physician has to be acceptable to the employer and must have expertise in the medical issu es related to the insuf ficient volum e. The physician shall determine if a medical condition is present, and if so determ ine if the condition has, or with a high degree of proba bility could have, precluded the em ployee from providing a Anytim e an em ployee exhibits any of these behaviors, the BAT/STT m ust immediately term inate th e test, notif y the DER directly, and note the test refusal on the form . Chapter 8. Alcohol Testing Procedures 8-9 August 2002 sufficient amount of breath. A m edical condition includes any ascertainable physiological condition or a m edically docum ented pre-existing psychological disorder. This does not include unsupported assertions of \"situational anxiety\" or hyperventilation. The extern al calib ration check of the EBT produces a resu lt outside the allowed to lerance levels. In this case, every test result of 0.02 or above obtained on the E BT since the last v alid external calibra tion che ck will be cancelled (\u00a740.2 These resu lts are cons idered \"fata l flaws\" and cannot be corrected. The test is cancelled and considered neither positiv e nor negativ e. Cancelled te sts must be rep orted to the DER within 48 hours of the cancellation. The em ployee must be treated as if the test never occurred. If the em ployee needs a negative test result for a return -to-duty or follow-up test, a retest m ust be perform ed. Otherwise, a retest following a cancelled test is prohibited. A cancelled test does not count toward the m inimum random testing rate requirem ents. If no valid m edical explanation is f ound, the insufficient volum e is considered a tes t refusal. If a valid m edical explanation is provided, th e test will b e cancelled. Incomplete or Cancelled Tests (\u00a740.267). To protect the integrity of the test and to ensure accurate results, the procedu res for conducting an alcoho l breath test are rigorous. Alcohol confirm ation tests are consider ed invalid when the f ollowin g occurs: A saliva test is used f or a screen tes t after its expiration date, the waiting time specified by the manufacturer is not adhered to, or the device is not activ ated; Other problem s that occur are considered correctable. If the BAT/STT becom es aware of a problem during the testing process, the BAT/STT m ust try to correct the problem immediately and, if necessary, repeat the test. If a test is repeated, the BAT/STT i s not lim ited to the num ber of attem pts that can be m ade to com plete the te st as lo ng as the employee is m aking a good faith effort to provide the breath specim en. If a testing device is inoperable, efforts must be m ade to locate another testing device to com plete the te st. The BAT does not wait 15 m inutes between the screen ing an d confirmatory tests ; A valid air blank test is not perform ed before each confirm ation test; The air blank conducted before the confirm ation test has a reading other than 0.00; The EBT f ails to pr int th e confirm ation results; If the BAT/STT or em ployer becom es aware of a \"correctable flaw\" that has not already been corrected, the individual must take all practicable action s to co rrect the p roblem so that the test is not cancelle d. If these problem s are not corrected, the test m ust be cancelled. The sequential test num ber on the EBT is not the sam e as the num ber on the printout, or the alcohol concentration displayed on the EBT is different f rom what was printed out; or Chapter 8. Alcohol Testing Procedures 8-10 August 2002 All written or unwritten contracts, agreem ents, or arrangements with s ervice agents concerning the provision of DOT drug and alcohol testing services are deem ed, as a m atter of law, to require compliance with all applicable DOT and FTA drug and alcohol testing regulations (\u00a740.11). Exam ples of errors that require corre ctive action includ e the f ollowing: The BAT/STT does not sign the ATF; If the em ployee fails to sign Step 4 of the ATF, and the BAT/STT neglec ts to n ote such in the Remarks section of the A TF; and Employer A ctions. Once an em ployer is notified by the BAT/STT of a confirm ed positiv e alco hol tes t result ( 0.04) or a test refusal, the em ployer must imm ediately remove the em ployee f rom safety-se nsitive job duties. The em ployer m ust not wait for the written report from the BAT. The employee cannot be returned to safety- sensitive du ty until the e mployee has successf ully com pleted the retu rn-to-duty process as defined further in Chapter 9 of these Guide lines. The BAT/STT uses a non-DOT alcohol testing for m for a DOT test. All \"fatal\" and \"correctable\" flaws must be docum ented. No person concerned with the testing process including the em ployer, employee representative, arbitrator, etc., may declare a tes t cancelled based on a mistake in the process that does not have a significant adverse effect on the right of the employee to a fair and accurate test. Thus, minor adm inistrative m istakes or an error that does not affect em ployee protections cannot be used as grounds to cancel DOT test resu lts. A test result that is 0.02 or greater, but less th an 0.0 4 is not a po sitive test un der the regulations and, therefore, does not have the same consequences. Since the test result is also non-negative, the employee m ust be removed f rom saf ety-sen sitive duties and cannot be allowed to return until the next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than 8 hours. The em ployee m ay perfor m safety-sensitive functions earlier if a retes t indicates an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02. Because an alcohol test result in this range is not positive, em ployers m ay not impose any additional consequences under FTA authority. However, em ployers m ay establish consequences for a non-negative test resu lt under the ir independent authority that is othe rwise consis tent with law. For exam ple, som e employers discipline employees that have been rem oved from duty because of a non-negativ e test result as an unexcused absence and not as a violation of the FTA drug and al cohol testing rule. Section 5. EMPLO YER RESPONSIBILITI ES Employers are responsible for ensuring that all aspects of the alcohol testing program are in com pliance with 49 C FR Part 40. Even though employers may hire servic e agen ts to pe rform the testin g functions, the em ployer cannot delegate the responsibility for com pliance. An FTA recip ient o r subrecip ient whose service agents do not m eet, or who violate, applicable requirem ents and procedures of Part 40 will be deem ed to be out of compliance and subject to losing their FTA funding. Chapter 8. Alcohol Testing Procedures 8-11 August 2002 The summary on the following page provides a quick reference of test results and subsequent em ployer actions. For m ore explanation, the regula tory text should be consulted. If a test is cancelle d when a negative test is required (i.e., re turn-to-duty, follow-up), the em ployer m ust send the em ployee back for another test. The em ployer cannot add any consequ ences to a cancelled tes t. The employer is not allowed to alter an alcohol test resu lt once confirm ed by the BAT. In addition to stipulating the consequences of a positive alcohol test result, em ployers should clearly specify in their com pany plan other em ployee actions that are prohibited by the FTA regulation. Prohibited employee conduct includes the following: Using alcohol while perform ing safety-sens itive f unction s; Using alcoh ol within 4 h ours prio r to perform ing safety-sensitive functions; Performing a saf ety-sensitive function with an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater; Consum ing alcohol while on-call; and Using alcohol within 8 hours following a covered accident unless the em ployee has alread y taken a post-accident alcohol test. Employers must not perm it a safety- sensitive em ployee to perform a safet y- sensitive function if that em ployee has violated any of these provisions. Em ployers should also estab lish co nsequences for each of the prohibited behaviors. Chapter 8.

Frank, Office of Resear ch and Traffic R ecords, Res earch and Evaluation Di visio n (NTS-31), National Highway Traffic Safety Administratio n, 40 0 Sevent h Street, SW., Washington, DC 366- 5593. SUPPLEME NTARY INF ORMATION : On August 2, 1 994, Model Specifications for Screening Devices to M easure Al cohol in Bodil y Fluids were published in t he Federal Register (59 FR 39382). In these model specifications, NHTSA recognized indus try efforts t o develop new technologies. T hese specifications established perform ance criteria and methods for testi ng alcohol screening devices using either breath or other bodil y fluids to m easure al cohol content . NHTSA established these spe cificat ions to support State laws t hat target youthful offenders (i.e., ``zero tolerance '' laws) and the Department of Transportation' s wor kplace alcohol testing pro gram. NHTSA published its first CPL for screening devices on Decem ber 2, 1994 (59 FR 61923; with a correction in 59 FR 65128). Five devices were on that first list. On August 15, 1995, N HTSA amended its CPL of screening devices to measure alcohol in bodil y fluids in the Federal Register (60 FR 42214) by addi ng two additional de vices to the list, thereby bringing the list to seven devices. Chapter 8. Alcohol Testing Procedures 8-19 August 2002 Since the publication of that list, five add itional de vices have be en evaluated at the Volpe National Transportation S ystems Center in Cam bridge, MA an d found to con form to the model specifications. Accordingly , these five devices, listed in alphabetical order, are being added t o the CPL. The first n ew listing is the ``Alcohol TM'' disposable breath alco hol tubes manufactured by Akers Laboratories, Inc., of Thorofare, NJ. The se are disposa ble tubes that use a potassium dichrom ate color change t o indicate whether the BAC of a breath sam ple is above the 0.02 threshold. These devices passed all requirements of the m odel sp ecifications except when read under sodium vapor lighting conditions. Hence, they are approved for use except under sodium vapor lighting conditions, and the manufact urer's pa ckage insert specif ies this lim itation. The second new listing i s the Alco Check 9000 m anufactured b y Alco Check International o f Hudsonville, MI. This devi ce differs fro m the Alco Ch eck 3000 D.O.T. and the Alco Screen 3000 (the same device sold u nder two different names) in that it allows for the storage and retrieval of test data by use of an add ed memory chip. As the Alco Ch eck 30 00 D.O.T. an d the Alco Screen 3000 alr eady conform to these model sp ecific ations, and the a dded memory chip does not change the alcohol- measuring capabilit y of the device, NHTSA did not require the new Alco Check 9000 to be r etested before listing it on this CPL for screeni ng devices. The third new device on the CPL is the ABI (Alcoh ol Breath Indicator) manufactured by HAN International Co. Ltd. of Seoul, Korea. This is an el ectronic device with a two-digit n umerical display that uses a semi-conductor sens or. The last two devices are the ``PAS IIIa'' and the ``PAS Vr '' manufactured by PAS Sy stem s International, Inc. of Fredericksburg, V A. These ar e both electronic devices that use a fuel cel l sensor with a two-digit num erical display. The PAS IIIa and PAS Vr are modifications of two different passive alcohol sensors made by the same co mpany, but with a disposable m outhpiece added so that a n appropriate d eep-lung air sam ple can be obtained for breath measurem ents. Two housekeeping item s are also addressed in this notice. First, the co mpany previously listed as STC Diagnostics, Inc. has changed its nam e to OraSure Technolo gies, In c. and the new CPL reflects the inclusion of t he new co mpany name in addition to t he old one. The name of its prod uct, the Q.E.D. A150 Saliva Al cohol Test, remains the same. Second, there are a nu mber of handheld bre ath test devices on the NHTSA CPL for Ev idential Breath Tester s that frequently are used as screening devices. It should be noted that any devi ce on the m ost recent NHTSA CPL for EBTs which was published on Jul y 21, 2000 (65 FR 4541 9) that w as tested against the 199 3 Model Specifications for Evidential Breath Testers (58 FR 48 705) also full y meets the requirem ents of the Model Specifications for Screening Devices that Measure Al cohol i n Bodil y Fluids. Bot h procedures evaluate the perfor mance of instrum ents at the 0.020 BAC level. Chapter 8.

The devi ce is being listed on this C PL with the understanding that the manufacturer will specify in written instructions accom panying the product t hat the device should not be used under sodium vapor lighting conditions. It passed the testing under all other conditions. \\3\\ While the ALCO-SCRE EN 02TM saliva-alcohol screening device manufactured b y Chem atics, Inc. passed the re quirements of the m odel sp ecific ations when tested at 40 deg.C (104 deg.F), the manufacturer has indicated that the device cannot exce ed storage tem peratures of 27 deg.C ( 80 deg.F). Instructions to this effect a re stated on all p ackaging a ccompanying the device. Accordingly , the device should not be stored at tem peratures above 27 d eg.C (80 deg. F) and, if the device is stored at or below 27 deg.C (80 deg.F) and used at higher te mperatures (i.e., within a m inute), the devices met the model sp ecifications and the results persi sted for 10- 15 m inutes. W hen these devices w ere stor ed at or below 27 deg.C (80 deg.F) and were equilibrated at 40 deg.C (104 deg.F) for an hour prior to sample application, the devices fai led to m eet the model specifications. Storage at tem peratures above 27 deg. C (80 deg.F), for even brief periods of ti me, may result in false negative readings. \\4\\ While this device passed all of the re quirement s of the m odel sp ecifications, readings shoul d be taken onl y after the tim e specified by the manufactur er. For valid re adings, the us er should foll ow the manufacturer's instructions. Readings should be taken one (1) m inute after a sample is introdu ced at or above 30 deg.C (86 deg.F); readings sho uld be ta ken a fter two (2) minutes at 18 d eg.C-29 deg. C (64.4 deg.-84. 2 deg .F); and readings shoul d be taken after five (5) m inutes when testing at tem peratures at or below 17 deg.C (62.6 deg.F). If the re ading is taken before five (5) m inutes has elapsed under the cold conditi ons, the user is likel y to obtain a reading t hat underestimates the actual saliva-alcohol level. Chapter 8. Alcohol Testing Procedures 8-21 August 2002 Note that the device made by Akers Laboratories, Inc. is a single-use, disposable breath te st device. The devices manufactured by Chem atics, Inc., OraSure Technologi es, Inc., Roche Diagnostic System s, Inc., and STC Technologies, I nc. are all single-use, dispo sable saliva alcohol test devices. The other devices listed are el ectronic breath testers. Those manufactured by PAS System s Inter national, Inc. use a fuel-cel l sensor, whereas those manufact ured by Alco Check International, Guth Labora tories, Han International Co., Ltd. , Repco marketing, Inc., and Sou nd Off, Inc. use sem i-conductor sensors.

ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice amends the Conforming Products List for instruments that conform to the Model Specifications for Evidential Breath Testing Devices (58 FR 48705). EFFECTIVE DATE: July 21, 2000. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. James F. Frank, Office of Traffic Injury Control Programs, Impaired Driving Division (NTS-11), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, D.C. 20590; Telephone: (202) 366-5593. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : On November 5, 1973, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published the Standards for Devices to Measure Breath Alcohol (38 FR 30459). A Qualified Products List of Evidential Breath Measurement Devices comprised of instruments that met this standard was first issued on November 21, 1974 (39 FR 41399). On December 14, 1984 (49 FR 48854), NHTSA converted this standard to Model Specifications for Evidential Breath Testing Devices, and published a conforming Products List (CPL) of instruments that were found to conform to the Model Specifications as Appendix D to that notice (49 FR 48864). On September 17, 1993, NHTSA published a notice (58 FR 48705) to amend the Model Specifications. The notice changed the alcohol concentration levels at which instruments are evaluated, from 0.000, a test for the presence of acetone; and expanded the definition of alcohol to include other low molecular weight alcohols including methyl or isopropyl. On June 4, 1999, the most recent amendment to the Conforming Products List (CPL) was published (64 FR 30097), identifying those instruments found to conform with the Model Specifications. Since the last publication of the CPL, two (2) instruments have been evaluated and found to meet the model specifications, as amended on September 17, 1993, for mobile and 45420 Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 141 / Friday, July 21, 2000 / Notices non-mobile use. They are: (1) Intoxilyzer 400PA manufactured by CMI, Inc. of Owensboro, KY. This device is a hand-held breath tester with a fuel cell alcohol sensor. (2) Alco Sensor IV-XL manufactured by Intoximeters, Inc. of St. Louis, MO. This device is a hand-held breath tester with a fuel cell alcohol sensor that is microprocessor controlled. It is designed to minimize operator involvement in performing the test and processing the test data. The CPL has been amended to add these two instruments to the list. In accordance with the foregoing, the CPL is therefore amended, as set forth below.

Chapter 9 . SUBSTANCE ABUS E PROFESSIONALS, REHABI LITATION, AND TREATMENT duty proces s. The SAP is the \"gatek eeper\" of the return-to-du ty process and is responsible for protecting public safety to the greatest extent po ssible by professionally evaluating the em ployee and recom mending appropriate education/treatm ent, follow-up tests, and aftercare in the event th e employee return s to pe rform ing safety-sen sitive functions. The FTA regulations require that any individu al who has a pos itive drug te st, a breath alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater, or refused a te st, m ust imm ediately be rem oved from his/her safety-sensitive position [\u00a76 55.61]. In addition, h e/she m ust be advised of the resources available to evaluate and resolve p roblems associated with drug abuse or alcohol m isuse, including the nam es, addresses, and telephone numbers of substance abuse professionals (SAP) and counseling and treatm ent program s. Em ployers must provide these services to their em ployees even if their policy is to term inate employees who violate the drug and alcohol regulations. Previously, the regulations that covered the SAP functions were defined in the various m odal adm inistration (e.g., F TA) drug and alcohol tes ting regulations. However, with the publication of the revised DOT regulations on drug and alcohol testing procedures (49 CFR Part 40), the SAP qualif ications, roles, resp onsibilities, and procedures were relocated in Subpart O of Part 40. If you allow em ployees to return to duty following a positiv e test result or test refusal, the individual cannot be allowed to return to a s afety-sens itive position until he/she has com pleted the SAP evaluation, referral, edu cation /treatm ent, and return-to- August 2002 9-1Chapter 9. S ubstance Abuse Professionals, Rehabilitation, and Treatm ent Section 1. SAP QUALIFICATIONS A substance abuse professional (SAP) must have th e following creden tials [\u00a740.281]: (1) An SAP must be a licensed physician (Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy); or a licensed or certified psychologist; a licensed or certified social worker; o r a licensed or certified em ployee assis tance p rofessional; o r an alcohol and drug abuse counselor certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors Certif ication Comm Reciprocity Consortium /Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse (ICRC). (2) The SAP must have knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatm ent of substance abuse-related disorders, and m ust have knowledge of the SAP's role in the protection of public safety. The SAP must be well infor med about Part 40 and the pertinent DOT agency (i.e., FTA) regulations. Every SAP must have his/her own copy of The Substance A buse Professional Guideline s published by the DOT Office of Drug and Alcohol Policy and Com pliance (ODAPC) in August 2001, and must be aware of any significant changes to the regulations and/or Guideline s. (3) In addition, SAPs m ust com plete qualifications training. S APs currently practicing have until Decem ber 31, 2003 to obtain the training, whereas individuals wishing to begin SAP practice after December 31, 2003 must meet the training requirem ent before perform ing SAP functions. Please refer to Chapter 5 for inform ation on qualification training. (4) Following the qualifications training, the individual must satisf actorily com plete an exam ination that is given by a nationally recognized professional or training organization. The exam ination must cover all elem ents discussed in the qualifications training, and the test m ust be validated by a test evaluation organization. (5) SAPs m ust also successfully complete 12 hours of professional developm ent training or C ontinuing E ducation Units (CEU) every 3 years following th e com pletion of the initial qualificat ions training. The CEUs must be relevant to the perform ance of SAP duties and includ e materials co ncerning new technologies, interpretations, recen t guidance, rule changes, and other S AP issues. A prim ary SAP should be selected w ho will be resp onsible f or providing s ervices to your em ployees. This professional should be encouraged to learn about your operations and the safe ty-sensitiv e functions that your employees perform . Such August 2002 9-2Chapter 9. S ubstance Abuse Professionals, Rehabilitation, and Treatm ent knowledge will be a m ajor ass et when assessing the needs of your em ployees and their ability to perf orm safety-sens itive duties. Backup SAPs should also be selected to provide assessm ents whe n the prim ary SAP is not available. MROs, other physicians, community m ental health centers, Employee Assis tance Prog rams (EAP), universities, private practitioners, and trad e associations may provide you with a list of possible SAPs in your area. Section 2. SAP RO LES AND RESPONSIBILITI ES Any tim e an em ployee or applicant tests positiv e for drugs or alcohol, or refu ses a test, the em ployer is required to imm ediately remove the individua l from safety-se nsitive duties and make an SAP ref erral. Addition al consequences are left to the discretion of the individual employer. Som e employers provide a second chance, while others adhere to a zero-tolerance policy and discharg e the em ployee. The role of the SAP varies depending on if the em ployee is terminated o r allowed to return to duty. Employers that have zero-tolerance polic ies (i.e., first positiv e results in termination) m ust provide the em ployees a list of SAPs that a re readily ava ilable with names, addresses, and telephone numbers [\u00a740.287]. Applicants who test pos itive or refuse a test must al so be provided a SAP list. Em ployers with z ero-tolerance polic ies are not required to provide a SAP evaluation or any subsequent recomm ended education or treatm ent. The em ployer is only required to make a ref erral to a q ualified SA P. If the individual chooses to make an appointm ent and follow through with the assessment and subsequent treatm ent, he/she does so on their own at their own expense, and without any participation by the em ployer. Employers with second chance policies, however, must provide a SAP list and ensure that em ployees have completed the SAP evaluation, referral, educ ation/treatm ent, and return-to-duty process before the individual can be allowed to perf orm saf ety-sen sitive job duties [\u00a740.291]. Who pays for SAP evaluations and services is up to em ployer discretion, and is not dictated by the re gulation. In som e cases, SAP assessm ents are covered under health care benefits. The decision of who pays is also open to collective bargaining. When an e mployee is ref erred to a S AP, the SAP m ust carry out the responsibilities defined in S ubpart O of Part 40. Initial SAP Evaluation [\u00a740.293]. Make a com prehensiv e face-to-face assessm ent and clin ical evaluation to determ ine what lev el of assis tance th e employee needs in resolving problems associated w ith alcohol use or prohibited drug use. T he evaluation should be comprised of a standard psychosocial history, an in-depth drug and alcohol use history, and current m ental status. The evaluation should provide a diagnosis, treatm ent recommendations, and a treatm ent plan that m ust be follow ed by the employee. August 2002 9-3Chapter 9. S ubstance Abuse Professionals, Rehabilitation, and Treatm ent Education/Treatment Program Referral [\u00a7 40.29(c)(d )]. Refer the employee to an appropriate education and/or treatm ent program that m eets the unique needs of the individual and to the greatest extent possible will allow the individual to return to a safety-sensitive position without undue concern for public safety. An education/treatm ent program must be recomm ended for every individual that is assessed. T he SAP m ay not determ ine that education/treatm ent is not required. The recomm endation m ust be provided to the employer in a written report. Follow -up Evaluation [\u00a740.301]. Conduct a face-to -face follow-up evaluation to the ac tively participa ted in and succ essfully complied with the recomm ended education/treatm ent program . This evaluation m ust be completed before an employer can return an employee back to work. The evaluation should ascertain if the employee has successf ully com pleted the education/treatm ent program , has a prognosis fo r success, an d has dem onstrated subsequent behavior al changes. The evaluation must be based upon written reports from, and personal comm unication with, the education/treatm ent provider and the em ployee clin ical interview. This evaluation should not be viewed as a cursory administrative review, but should determ ine if the em ployee can reas onably be ex pected to return to safety-sensitive duties without undue concern for public safety. If the SAP determ ines th at the em ployee has not dem onstrated successful compliance and rem ains a risk to public safety, the SAP must recomm end that the em ployee not return to duty at that time and the em ployer is prohibited from returning the em ployee to safety-sensitive job duties. How the employer responds is the em ployer's decision and should be defined in the employer's policy and/or labor m anagem ent agreem ents. Thus, som e employers m ay instruct the SAP to conduct additional follow-up evaluations w hile other employers may take personnel action against the employee. If the SAP has dete rmined that the employee has m ade suffi cient progress, the SAP m ay recommend that the em ployee be allowed to r eturn to saf ety-sens itive duties. In either case, the SAP must provide a written report to the em ployer highlighting the clinical evaluation results, subsequent recomm endation, and if appropriate, aftercare recomm Once the SAP has determ ined that the employee has successfully com plied with the pres cribed education /treatm ent program , the em ployer m ust make the final decision about wheth er the em ployee will b e perm itted to return to th e performance of safety-sensitive functions subject to company policy and collective bargaining agreem ents, as appropriate. If the em ployee will be a llowed to retu rn to work, th e employer must ensure th at the em ployee takes a return-to-duty test for drugs, alcohol, or both. If the em ployee's initial test was positiv e for drugs, at a m inimum the retu rn- to-duty test must be ne gative for drugs. If the em ployee's in itial tes t was positiv e for alcohol, at a m inimum the return-to-duty test must be an alcohol test w ith an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02. August 2002 9-4Chapter 9. S ubstance Abuse Professionals, Rehabilitation, and Treatm ent Follow -up Testing Plan [\u00a740.307]. If a recomm endation is m ade to le t the e mployee return to duty and the return-to-duty test is negative, the SAP m ust develop a follow-up testing plan for the em ployee returning to work. The SAP m ust determ ine the num ber and frequency of follow-up tests and whether the tests should be conducted for The requirem ents of the SAP's follow- up testing plan follow the em ployee to subsequent em ployers or through breaks in service [\u00a740.305]. drugs, alcohol, or both. The plan should be developed based on the unique circum stances of the individual. Aftercare [\u00a740.303]. Individuals enrolled in outpatient program s, self-help groups, etc., m ay be allowed to conduct the follow-up evaluation and the return-to-duty test p rior to com pletion of the f ull range of recomm ended education and/or treatm ent. This would only occur if the SAP believes that the em ployee has reached a critical point in their treatm ent program and m ade significant progress in their rehabilita tion where they no longer pose a risk to public safety. For exam ple, an employee enrolled in an 8-week out-patient program who reaches a critical tu rning point in h is/her life in week six m ay be evaluated by the SAP and allowed to re turn to duty prior to completion of the 8-week program . At a m inimum, the f ollow-up testing plan m ust consist of at least six tests in the first 12 m onths following the em ployee's return to saf ety-sen sitive duties. A f ollow- up testing plan that m eets only these minimums should be considered a rarity rathe r than a rule as the f ollow-up pr ogram should be unique to the individual and should be aggressive enough to deter and detect use of alcohol and prohibited drugs by the em ployee. The follow-up testing process sho uld serve as an essential component of the em ployee's rehabilitation process. Follow-up testing can last up to 60 months, but can be term inated by the SAP anytim e following the initial 12 m onths. However, employees who are actively enrolled in a n in-pa tient or a par tial in- patient program should not be considered eligible to re turn to du ty prior to prog ram completion. The SAP should not establish the actual test d ates, as the SAP will not nec essarily b e knowledgeable about the em ployee's work schedule. T herefore, the responsibility to schedule and carry out the follow-up tests is the em ployer's. Follow-up testing should be spread throughout the year, and be unpredictable and unannounced. Follow-up testing is in addition to random testing. August 2002 9-5Chapter 9. S ubstance Abuse Professionals, Rehabilitation, and Treatm ent In the ev ent individu als are allowed to return to duty prior to completion of their education/treatm ent program , the SAP is required to recomm end a n aftercare program that, am ong other things, will require the employee to com plete the tre atment program after returning to duty. Similarly, th e SAP is required to recomm end a n aftercare program for those individuals who have com pleted an education/treatm ent program , but are believed by the SAP to be in need of additional treatm ent or support to assist him/her in m aintaining sobriety or abstinence from drug us e following their return to duty. The SAP recomm endations for aftercar e must be inc luded in the written report provided to the employer following the follow-u p evalua tion. The DOT regulation [\u00a7 40.293] also states that when an em ployee has tested positiv e or r efused a dru g test, the S AP may consult with the MRO who verified the test to obta in information pertin ent to the evaluation. The MRO and SAP are free to discuss the test result , quantification levels (if already obtained by the MRO), and any other m edical inform ation relevant to the case. Release of this inf ormation does not require the employee's consent. The SAP may also communicate with education and/or treatm ent providers without employee consent regarding confidential information that is re levant to th e follow-up evaluation process. Employers are not required to follow the aftercare recommenda tions, but they are strongly encouraged to include them as part of a return-to-duty agreem ent or contract with the em ployee [\u00a740.303]. If the employee fails to follow the aftercare recomm endations, he/she m ay be subject to disciplinary action by the em ployer for failing to follow the conditions outlined in the re turn-to-duty agree ment. SAP Limitations [\u00a740.29(f)]. When making recommendations for education/treatm ent, SAPs are prohibited from considering em ployee claim s that the testing process was unju st or in accurate. As professionals, SAPs m ust not be swayed by statem ents from employees that attempt to lessen the seriousness of a DOT rule violation or the SAPs own personal opinions about the justification or rationale for the test. The S AP must assum e that a v erified positiv e test result has co nclusiv ely estab lished that the em ployee violated the DOT drug and/or alcohol rules. The SAP clinical reco rds for each employee must be m aintained in accordance with federal, state, and local laws regarding record m aintenance, conf identiality, and release of infor mation. In addition, these records m ust be m ade availab le to D OT agency rep resentatives and repres entatives of the Natio nal Transpo rtation Saf ety Board in an accident investigation, upon request. Once an SAP has m ade his/her evaluation and inform ed the em ployer in writing of their recomm endation, the employer (and em ploye e) is prohibited from seeking a second opinion. Only the SAP who m ade the initia l evaluation m ay modify the evaluation and recommendations based on new or addition al information. The SAP m ay also provide written reports directly to the em ployer without a signed release from the em ployee. Upon the employee's request, the SAP must make a copy of all S AP reports available to the employee except for inform ation regarding the follow-u p testing pla n. Records will a lso be released to other third parties (e.g., subsequent em ployers) with a written release from the em ployee. Confidentiality [\u00a740.311]. SAPs adhere to various federal and state laws and rules, codes of ethical standa rds, and certification and licensing board requirem ents lity. selor relationship is waiv ed if the employee poses a clear and imm inent danger to self or others, if there is known or suspected ch ild or el der abuse or neglect, when m edical records are court-ordered by a judge com pelling disclosure, or when the counselor seeks m edical or legal advice. Education/Treatment Options [\u00a740.293(c)(d)] . Appropriate education options m ay include, but are not lim ited to, self-help groups (e.g., Alcoholics Anonym ous), comm unity lectures w here attendance can be independently verified, and bona fide drug and alcohol education courses. Treatm ent options m ay include, but August 2002 9-6Chapter 9. S ubstance Abuse Professionals, Rehabilitation, and Treatm ent are not lim ited to, in-patient hospitalization, partial in-pa tient counseling program s, and aftercare. SAPs should be careful to assess the effectiveness of the program in term s of effecting actual rehabilitation of the individual rather than enrolling an individual in a detoxification program . A detox program works to rem ove the drugs/alcohol from a person's system , but does little to im pact future usage. An effective rehabilitation program , on the other hand, alters an indi vidual's behavior, changes their outlook on life, and im pacts their future life choices. A person that successfully com pletes an effective rehabilitation program has a m uch greater chance of rem aining drug and alcohol free. SAPs m ay not provide treatm ent to employees whom they have assessed, nor may SAPs have any financial or other ties to treatm ent providers who are treating employees the SAP referred. The rules, however, do not prohibit the SAP from referring an em ployee for assistance to 1) a public agency operated by a state, county, or municipality; 2) the employer's con tracted treatm ent provider; 3) the single substance abuse inpatient treatm ent program made available by the em ployee's insu rance coverage plan; and 4) the only education program reasonably lo cated with in the general commuting area. If the only treatm ent program available to the employee through the em ployee's insurance coverage is not considered by the SAP to be an effective or suitab le pro gram, the SAP should not recomm end t he covered program , but should identify other m ore appropriate program s even if not covered by the employee's insurance. SAPs should have a working knowledge of quality pr ogram s and qualif ied counselors, as well as insurance, benefit plans, em ployee's ability to pay, em ployer treatm ent contracts, and paym ent requirem ents. The SAP should know the employer's policies regarding paym ent for treatm ent and use of l eave (e.g., sick leave, vacation, leave without p ay) for treatm ent. Section 3. EM PLO YEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS Program s that address substance abuse problem s in the workplace are often referred to as Em ployee Assistance Program s, or EAPs. EAPs help em ployees and fam ily members with personal and behavioral problem s, including, but not lim ited to, health, m arital, financial, alcohol, drug, legal, and e motional s tress tha t may adversely affect job perf ormance, productivity, and m ost importantly, safety. All sizes and types of employers have instituted EAPs because they can help save money through decreased absenteeism, fewer accidents, reduced use of insurance benefits, savings in worker's com pensation claim s, fewe r grievan ces arbitrations, as . confiden tial record keeping, determ inatio n of suitability to r eturn to work, and recommendation for follow-up testing), and the additional cost to expand an existing EAP to includ e SAP services are lower than the initia l costs to es tablish a new August 2002 9-7Chapter 9. S ubstance Abuse Professionals, Rehabilitation, and Treatm ent SAP, m any em ployers have looked to their EAPs for SAP services. On the surface, th is appears to be a wise decision. However, many transit system s have found that an EAP m ay not be the best environm ent to find SAPs who are philosophically aligned with DOT program s, and they m ay not be the best location to house SAP services. FTA audits frequently found that SAPs in general misunderstand their role as the gatekeep er of the retu rn-to-duty process, and therefore, co mprom ise the integ rity of the process and public safety. This misunderstanding is associated with the philosophical m isalignment of EAP counselors and SAPs. EAP counselors are often viewed as advocates for the employee and as such, attem pt to return em ployees who have tested positive back to duty as soon as possible. This approach is consistent w ith the training that counselors often receiv e that em phasizes getting the person back into a stable work environm ent as soon as possible, where they m ust be accountable. This philosophy, however , is contrary to the basic prem ise upon which the SA P's function was estab lished. Due to the safety- sensitive na ture of the po sition s the employees fill, the SAP should be very conservative in his/her assessm ent of the employee and the progress m ade in education/treatm ent program s. \"Putting in the tim e\" is sim ply not enough for an individual returning to a safety-sens itive position. S imilarly, if the SAP rushes the return-to-duty test, the employee m ay be putting the public at risk. The SAP must not release the individual to com e back to work until the SAP has a reas onable level of assurance that the individual will stay drug and alcohol free based on the individual's attitude, support struct ure, participation in the treatm ent program , motivation, and demonstrated behavior changes. The SAP is the advocate for the public interest, not the employee. Given this difference of philosophical viewpoints, som e transit system s have chosen to separate the S AP function from the EAP function. In the trad itional role, the EAP re mains available to em ployees to help them deal with issues in confidence and, if needed, self refer to a treatm ent program for drug or alcohol problems. The SAP does not becom e involved unless there is a po sitive test resu lt or a tes t refusal on a DOT test. However, if an FTA rule violation occurs, the individual falls under the purview of the SAP and m ust be subject to the consequences and return-to-duty process defined in the regulations that were summarized previously in this chapter. By separating the functions, the credib ility a nd ef fective ness of the EAP program as an em ployee benefit is not compromised, and the seriousness and rigor of the SAP process is not diluted. Employees can better u nderstand the roles of the two entities rather than being confused by one counselor that pr esents two different approaches, standards of confidentiality, and advocacy depending on whether th ey act as the EAP counselor or the SAP gatekeeper. If separation of the functions is not possible, the SAP should be cautioned about the difference of approach, philosophy, and confidentia lity tha t defines the two roles. Employees should also be m ade aware of the differences. August 2002 9-8Chapter 9. S ubstance Abuse Professionals, Rehabilitation, and Treatm ent Self Referrals. One of the positive outcom es of the FTA drug and alcohol testing program is that it m akes e mployees aware of the effects and consequences of prohibited drug use and alcohol m isuse on personal health, safety, and the work environm ent. Em ployees are also aware of the consequ ences should they test p ositive or refuse a test under the employer's policy. As a result, individuals with drug or alcohol problem s may seek help to address their problem s prior to being detected through the employer's FTA drug and alcohol testing program . Employees are m ore likely to seek help if they can do so in a confidential manner, where th e program s are easy to access. Thu s, transit employers hav e found that EAP program s serve an im portant role in term s of s elf-referrals. If the em ployer encou rages self- referrals, the process m ust be clearly defined, with the elim ination of as m any barriers as possible. The em ployee should be m ade aware of the co nfidentia lity protections, nature of m anagem ent reports, treatment requirem ents, testing requirem ents, leave policy, and interrelation ship with th e FTA testin g program . Employees should know that self- referral does not in any way shield them from FTA tests or the co nsequences for a positiv e resu lt. The em ployee should be made aware if they will be rem oved f rom duty, assigned non-safety-sensitive tasks, or be allowed to continue with their regular job duties duri ng their sel f-referred treatment period. The em ployee must be inform ed if they will be required to participa te in an after care program and if they will be required to sign a return-to-duty agreem ent. Section 4. DR UG AND ALOCHOL REHABI LITATIO N AND TREATMENT As noted earlier, the FT A regulations do not require you to provide or pay for rehabilitation and treatment programs. However, rehabilitation and treatm ent program s are often an integral part of successful substance abuse program s. Additionally, research and experience have demonstrated that such program s can be highly cost-effective. The decision to provide rehabilitation to affected employees should be made with both the em ployer and employee's needs in m ind. Two basic types of treatm ent are available that include various inpatient and outpatient s ervices. Inpa tient treatm ents often involve a 1- to in the hospita l or r esiden tial treatm ent center and may be recommended for the m ore severely addicted person. Outpatient treatm ent is appropriate for persons who are employed and can benefit from education and behavior modification to rem ain drug- and/or alcohol- free. Outpatient s ervices predom inate in the transit industry; 75 percent of persons receiving treatm ent for drug addiction and/or a lcoholism are tre ated as ou tpatien ts. Intensive In patient Ser vices. Inpatient centers treat dependent people with physical and/or psychological complications. Patien ts in intensiv e treatment m ay need supervised detoxification and m ay suffer physical withdrawal symptom s. As part of treatment, patien ts will a ttend edu cation and awareness lectures and group therapy sessions. F requently, fam ily m embers are involved in treatm ent since dependency affects the e ntire family. Residential intens ive in patien t treatment m ay last f rom 1 to 4 weeks. August 2002 9-9Chapter 9. S ubstance Abuse Professionals, Rehabilitation, and Treatm ent Intensive Outpatient S ervice s. These services treat depende nt patients who ha ve fewer physical or psychological complicatio ns. They offer effective and less expensive alterna tives to residen tial care for individuals with rela stable hom e environm ents and supportive em ployers. The patien t receives education, g roup therapy, and individual counseling for up to 10 weeks, with m ost sessions scheduled in the even ings (generally three ses sions per week). These program s often require som e family involvem ent. Costs are generally one-third to one-half of intensive inpatient treatment. Outpatien t Follow -Up Services. Patients discharged from intensive treatm ent may need further help. This m ay be an outpatient follow-up program lasting several months to a year or m ore. One visit per week is typical. Many inpatient and intens ive ou tpatient tre atment plans include weekly follow-up sessions at no additional cost. Your SAP will d evelop a treatment program that best m eets the needs of the employee in a cost-effective m anner. The SAP should take the following issues into consideration when evaluating a treatm ent program 's effectiveness and m aking a treatment ref erral. Cost . High cost does not guarantee effectiveness. Conduct a cost comparison of program s. Cost dispar ities m ay result due to the number of professionals per bed, hours of one-on-one counseling and group therapy, days of treatm ent, amount of a ftercare counseling, or extent of other m edical resources utilized. Reputation . Ask other substance abuse professionals and form er program participants for their candid opinions. Staff qualifications . A quality program should have a balance of professionals. Nurses, physicians, psychologists, social workers, and formerly dependent counselors should staff intensive inpatient program s. There should be m edical manage ment of detoxification. All professional staff should be state- certified treatm ent specialists or counselors interning for certification. \"Whole person\" approach . Chemical dependency is caused by many factors - childhood developm ent, psychological instability, heredity, social environm ent, and lifestyle behaviors. A quality p rogram should m eet all needs - physical (diet and exercise), social (com munication skills), psychological (individual and group counseling), intellectual (education and awareness sessions), and spiritua l. Although treatm ent and rehabilitation is not required under the F TA regulations, a policy, which tries to reclaim hum an resources, should be carefully considered. At first glance, it m ay seem inappropriate to allow anyone to work again who has demonstrated a high-risk behavior such as drug or alcohol abuse. However, trained, skilled labor is a valuable resource, which demographic studies indicate m ay become incre asingly difficult to obtain and retain. You should consider employee replacem ent costs, as well as th e impacts on work productivity and m orale as you evaluate the cost-effectiv eness of re habilita tion s ervices.

ADMI NISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS FTA-covered em ployers m ust maintain certain records docum enting their testing program consistent with the requirements set forth in Subpart P of Part 40 and \u00a7655.71. These DOT and FTA requirem ents specify the type of records that must be kept and the corresponding length of tim e they should be maintained. These requirem ents should be considered m inimums. Sometimes, additional records are ne eded to com plete a paper trail and thoroughly docum ent the decision-m aking process. Sim ilarly, employers m ay extend the record retention period to coincide with tim elines for other data uses. F or exam ple, the statute o f limitations f or acc idents in som e states m ay exceed th e minimum retention requ irements for post-accident records set forth in the FTA regulations. Theref ore, it m ay be prudent for the em ployer to establish a record retention polic y that addresses both the FTA m inimum requirem ents, and other potential needs for the infor mation. The regulation [\u00a7655.71] clearly specifies that reco rds m ust be m aintained on test results, the testing process, return-to-duty process, and em ploye e training. In addition, you m ust submit annual reports to FTA regarding testing program activities and results. The regulations specify record keeping requirem ents for both employers [\u00a7655.71 and \u00a740.333] and service [Part 40 Subpart P]. Section 1.

These general records include the following: Current policy statem ent listing effective date and the governing board's approval (e.g., resolution/minutes); em ployee and new hire policy receipt acknowledgem ents. Previous policy statem ents listing effective dates and the corresponding governing board approvals; employee and new hire po licy receip t acknowledgm ents. Training records documenting employee training and supervisor reasonable suspicion training. Docum entation should include training agendas with major topics, corresponding tim e allotments, instruc tor, an d roste r of attendees by date. If possible, employers should keep copies of training m aterials used. The employer should also docum ent that em ployees were notified of hotlin e numbers and ke ep copies of infor mational displays and handout m aterials with dates of distribution or display [\u00a7655.71(c)(4)]. Credentials docum enting that each service agent m eets the minimum ents for basic knowledge, qualifications training, certification/exam ination, error- correction training, and refresher training. If the service agents maintain the se reco rds, the employer should perform and keep documents of periodic spot checks to en sure that th e minimum requirem ents are m et. Log of Evidential Breath Testing Device external calibration checks [\u00a740.333]. Managem ent Inform ation System annual reports [\u00a7655.71(c)(5)]. Safety-sensitive con tractor oversight docum ents, including proof of policy adoption, training, use of qualified service agents, rand om selection process, record keeping, and test results. A com pliance check list (see Sample Docum entation section at end of this chapter), and/or periodic inspection records are useful. Random selection process with docum entation of scientific validity of m ethodology used. The em ployer should also keep docum entation of all random numbers drawn with explanation for any test not conducted [\u00a7655.71(c)(1)]. Employers m ay also wish to m aintain docum entation explaining why jobs were designated safety-sensitive positions. This explanation m ay also be incorporated into individual job descriptions. In addition to the gene ral reco rds, th e employer must keep individual test records specific to each covered em ployee. These records m ay be kept in alphabetical order by employee, or by test category. Flow charts showing docum ent flow for each category of test are sho wn in the Sa mple Docum entation section at the end of th is chapter. Chapter 10. Adm inistrative Requirem ents 10-3 August 2002 Pre-em ploym ent test records should include docum entation that written notice of the drug test requirem ent was given to each applicant, the DOT Chain of Custody and Control (CCF) form , and the test result. If possible, the em ployer should note when the ap plican t was assigned safety-sensitive duties. Also, the em ployer m ust keep copies of the em ployee consen t forms requir ed to o btain test ults from previous D OT-covered em ployers, docum entation of the employers good faith effort to obtain the inform ation from the previous employers, and previous em ployer responses w ith corresponding docum entation [\u00a740.25; \u00a740.333]. Random test records should include the CCF f or all d rug tes ts, the MRO test resu lt report, and the ATF f or all alcohol tests [\u00a7655.71(c)(1)]. Post-accident test records should include a ref erence to the acciden t (i.e., accident num ber, location, date) to ensure tha t the test rec ords are attributed to the corresponding acciden t. The reco rd must state the decision-m aking process of why a test was or was not conducted [\u00a7655.44(d)]. The record m ust docum ent the reason for any delay that caused an alcohol test to occur more than 2 hours from the tim e of the accident, or that caus ed test attem pts to cease because the alcohol test was delayed m ore than 8 hours from the time of the accident [\u00a7655.44(a)(2)(ii)]. The record should also include docum entation of the reason for any delay that caused test attem pts to ceas e because the drug test was delayed m ore than 32 hours from the tim e of the accid ent. The docum entation should also include the CCF with corresponding drug test result, and the ATF [\u00a7655.71(c)(1)]. Reasonable suspicion test records should include the supervisor's docum entation of the observation or event, which trigg ered th e reason able suspicion determ ination, the nam e of the em ployee involved, the date and time of the observation, the safety- sensitive function being perform ed at the tim e of the observation, circum stances of the observation, and the obje ctive f acts that led to the determ ination. The record should also include the CCF, docum entation of the drug test result, and the ATF [\u00a7655.71(c)(1)]. The record m ust state the reason for any delay that caused an alcohol test to occur m ore than 2 hours from the tim e of the observation, or that caused test attem pts to cease because the alcohol test was delayed m ore than 8 hours from the time of the observation. The record should also include docum entation of the reason for any delay that caused test attem pts to cease becau se the drug test was delayed m ore than 32 hours from the time of the observation. Positiv e test result records should be maintained in individual em ployee files for at least 5 years. Po sitive drug test records must include the CCF, docum entation from the MRO indicating the test resu lt, split specim en test results, if any, and SAP referral [\u00a7655.71]. If po ssible, service agent credentials or pertin ent infor mation should accom pany the positive test re sult. Positiv e alcohol test records ( 0.04) m ust include the ATF and the SAP referral. If possible, EBT calibration docum entation and BAT Chapter 10. Adm inistrative Requirem ents 10-4 August 2002 certification should also accom pany the ATF. Test records indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, must also be m aintained for 5 years. Em ployee test refusa ls should also be maintained in individual em ployee files for at least 5 years. Test ref usal docum entation should include the DAPM, supervisor, collector, an d/or BAT statem ents of facts and circum stances related to the refusal [\u00a7655.71(c)(2)]. Documentation associated with a substitute or adulterated specim en should include the CCF, MRO's report of results (including the assessm ent of the referral physician, if appropriate), split specim en results, if any, and SAP referral. In instances of insufficie nt volume , the employer should m aintain the CCF and docum ent the sele ction and evaluation of the referral physician, a nd the MRO's final determ ination of whether an existing medical condition caused the insufficient volum e [\u00a7655.71(c)(1)]. If the em ployer has a second chance policy, the employee file must includ e the SAP's initial assessm ent, recomm endation for treatm ent, reas ent, and th e release to work docum entation. The file m ust include the CCF, drug test result, and ATF for the return-to-duty test, as well as the SAP's recommended follow-up testing plan and subsequent CCFs, test results, and ATFs for the corresponding follow -up tests [\u00a7655.71 (c)(3)]. Records reg arding pos itive tes t resu lts, test refusals, and em ployee dispu tes that are associated w ith individual em ployees must be m aintained f or at le ast 5 year s. File m anagem ent methods are discussed in Section 4.5 of the Best Practices m anual under \"Record Keeping Methods.\" Appendix B of the Best Practices m anual contains examples of for ms and m aster logs used to docum ent the various types of tests conducted. These form s and logs are discussed in Section 4.1 of the m anual under the different types of testing. If properly maintained, these records provide a comprehensive paper trail that documents and supports all testing decisions and m akes program oversight, adm inistration, and production of annual reports easier. All FTA drug or al coho l test reco rds must be kept in a secure location with controlled access [\u00a7655.71(a)]. Most employers have found that keeping their FTA drug and alcohol te sting records in a separate lo cked file cab inet is the easiest way to m eet this requirem ent. Thes e records should also be m aintained separate f rom personnel records and medical records to ensure that no unauthorized persons have access to tes t resu lts. Th e em ployer must clearly def ine who will h ave acce ss to the files and for what purpose. In m ost cases, access to tes t resu lts is lim ited to one or two people within an organization, m ost commonly the DAPM and his/her assistant. Otherwise, access to inform ation should be restricted to all agency em ployees. This bar to inf ormation inclu des all syste m employees, union representatives, manage ment, supervisory personnel, and board m embers. Individuals within the organization should onl y be privy to the inform ation on a \"need to know\" basis. Thus, in the case of a pending dism issal or disciplinary action due to a positive test, the employee's supervisor who nor mally handles dism issals would need to know the reason for th e dism issal and therefore, it would be appropriate to inform the superviso r of the positiv e test resu lt. Care should be taken, however, to ensure the test results do not becom e \"comm on knowledge\" due to any action or comm ent Chapter 10. Adm inistrative Requirem ents 10-5 August 2002 Laboratories m ust maintain non-negative specim ens in secure, lon g-term frozen storage for a m inimum of 1 year [\u00a740.99]. If the prim ary specim en is non-negative, the split spec imen m ust be stored f or at least 1 year or for the sam e period of tim e that the prim ary specim en is retained. The laboratory must retain all record s pertaining to each sp ecim en for a m inimum of 2 years [\u00a740.109]. The records and specim ens m ust be m aintained for a longer period if requested by the em ployer, em ployee, MRO, or DOT agency. by m anagem ent personnel. See discussion on confidentiality and inform ation disclosu re later in this ch apter. If a consortium is used to adm inister the employer's testing program , the e mployer may arrange to have the consortium maintain som e or all of its records. It is no t necessary, u nder thes e circum stances , for the em ployer to m aintain a duplic ate set of records, however, it m ay be in the employer's best interest to keep copies. See Chapter 11 of these Guideline s for a more detailed discussion of possible roles and responsibilities of consortium s. Regardless of who m aintains the em ployer's records, it is the em ployer's respon sibility a cu rrent records are kept that co mply with FTA regulations. Laboratories m ust produce and retain an aggregate statistical sum mary of drug test results for each em ployer on a sem i-annual basis [\u00a740.111]. The inform ation required for the summ ary is presented in the Sam ple Docum entation section of this chapter. The summary for the period beginning on January 1 through June 30 of each year m ust be reported to em ployers by July 20 of the same calendar year. Summaries covering the period from July 1 through December 31 must be reported by January 20 of the next calendar year. The laboratory m ust also maintain the se summ ary reports f or at least 2 years. Checklists of how long you should retain each of your records can be found in the Sample Docum entation section of this chapter. Service Agent Record Keeping Requirements. The various serv ice agents participating in the DOT drug and alcohol testing process also h ave specific record keeping requirem ents. The lab summ ary reports m ust not include any em ployee specific inform ation or inform ation upon which an em ployee's identity can be inferred. Thus, laboratory reports will not be se nt to em ployers that have fewer than 5 aggregate test results. Collection sites m ust keep copies of Copy 3 of the CCF for at least 30 days [\u00a740.73(a)(9)]. Specim en collectors must maintain rec ords documenting their credentials including qu alifications training, proficiency dem onstration, refresher training, and error co rrection training. These reco rds m ust be m ade available to employers and DOT age ncy representatives upon request [\u00a740.33(g)]. Sim ilarly, BAT/STTs must also mainta in docum entation of their credentials and m ake them available to em ployers or DOT agency representatives upon request [\u00a740.213(g)]. Medica l review of ficers must m aintain docum entation of their credentials including medical licenses, qualifications training, and continuing education credits [\u00a740.121(e)]. These reco rds m ust be m ade available to employers and DOT age ncy representatives upon request. Substance abuse professionals must also maintain and m ake their credentials and training docum entation available upon request [ \u00a740.281(e)]. In Chapter 10. Adm inistrative Requirem ents 10-6 August 2002 addition, SAPs m ust maintain copies of all reports provided to em ployers for a period of 5 years. Additional clinical records m ust be m aintained in acco rdance with federal, state, and local laws that govern confidentia lity and inf ormation disclosure [\u00a740.311(g)]. Section 2. CONFI DENTIALITY AND ACCESS TO RECORDS The FTA regulation [\u00a7655.73] states that test results m ay be released only when required by regulation or when the employee provides specific written consent, which means that the em ployee m ust indicate in his/her written statem ent the specific information that is to be rele ased, th e identity of the person to which the inform ation is to be released, and the specified tim e period. Vague, ill-defined, open-ended, or blanket statem ents of release are prohibited. The following circum stances requir e spec ific written c onsent: Employers and service agents shall release inform ation or copies of records regarding an em ployee's test results to a third party only as directed by specific written consent of the em ployee. Upon written request, employers must prom ptly provide any em ploye e with any and all records pertaining to his/her use of drugs or misuse of alcohol including test results. The only record that m ust be withheld from the employee is the SAP recomm ended follow-up testing plan [\u00a740.329]. The release of inform ation to the em ployee cannot be delayed pending paym ent for reproduction. Records m ust be released to subsequent em ployers upon receipt of a request that is acco mpanied by a written consent from the em ployee. The em ployer should release only the spec ific inf ormation f or the specific time period that is delineated in the request and should only be released to the person expressly authorized to receive the inform ation identified on the requ est. Specific written con sent is not required in the follow ing circum stances: Employers and service agents m ay disclos e information rela ted to a tes t result to the em ployee or the decision-m aker in a lawsuit (e.g., wrongful discharge), grievance (e.g., arbitration), or other p roceeding initiated by, or on behalf of, the employee tested. This includes worker's compensation, unem ployment com pensation, or other proceeding rela ted to a benefit sought by the em ployee when the drug or alcohol test results are pertinent to the proceed ing [\u00a740.323(a)(1)]. The inform ation may only be released to parties to the proceed ing. Employers and service agents m ay release test infor mation in a crim inal or civil action when a court of competent jurisdiction d etermines that it app lies to the case and issues an order directing the employer to produce the inform ation. The employer may release the inform ation only with a binding stipulation that the decision-m aker to whom it is r eleased will m ake it available only to parties to the proceed ing [\u00a740.323(a)(2)]. Employers and thei r serv ice agen ts must rele ase information to the National T ransporta tion Saf ety Chapter 10. Adm inistrative Requirem ents 10-7 August 2002 Board (NTSB) on any post-accident test performed for an accident under NTSB investigation. Employers and service agents shall make available copies of DOT- covered drug and alcohol testing program records when requested by DOT, any DOT agency with regulatory authority over the employer or any of its employees, or to the s tate o versigh t agency authorized to oversee rail fixed guideway system s. Employers and service agents m ust also disclose any and all drug and alcohol testing inform ation required under Part 655 to the state oversight agency or g rantee required to certify compliance to FTA on their beh alf. Thus, state departm ents of transpo rtation that adm iniste r rural public transit program s under Section 531 1 may have access to its subrecipient's drug and alcohol testing records to ensure com pliance. Similarly, grantees that contract out safety-sensitive functions to contractors can rev iew the contractor's drug a nd alcohol testing program records to m onitor compliance. Employers s hall m aintain records in a secure m anner, so that disclosure of inform ation to unauthorized persons does not occur. Release of infor mation under any other circum stance is prohibited by the regulations [ \u00a7655.73(a); \u00a740.231]. Besides the employer, the collection site, laboratory, Medical Review Officer, and Substance A buse Professional m ust also adhere to strict confid entiality requirem ents. The testing laborator y is prohibited from releasing individual te st results to anyone except the d esignated M RO. The MRO and the BAT should only report individual employee's test results to designated employer representatives and to the individual w ho was tested. MROs are also required to release drug test results and m edical infor mation to the employer, health care provider, SAP, DOT agency, or NTSB without the em ployee's consent, if the MRO determ ines the person is medically unqualified to perform safety- sensitive duties or poses a significant safety risk [\u00a740.327]. MROs, l aboratories, and SAPs are required to provide em ployees with copies of any reco rds pertaining to their drug and alcohol testi ng records within 10 days of receiving a written request fro m the employee. These records should be provided free of charge except for reproduction costs. The laboratory inform ation must be provided to the employee via the MRO. All reco rds including notes and checklists m ust be released except for those covered by other laws pertain ing to conf identia lity and the release of clinical reco rds. SAP recomm ended follow-up testing plans m ust not be released to em ployees. Employers and service agents m ust provide access to all facilities used to conduct DOT drug and alcohol testing functions by DOT or FTA agency representatives (e.g., auditors). The FTA representative m ust be given access to all written, printed, and computer-based records, rep orts, files, materials, data, docum entation, agreem ents, contracts, policies, and procedures. Laboratories m ust not, however, release or provide a specim en or a part of a specim en to a third party without first obtaining written consent from ODAPC. If a lab receiv es a court o rder to release a sp ecimen, the laborato ry must tak e necessary legal steps to contes t the issuance of the order. Chapter 10. Adm inistrative Requirem ents 10-8 August 2002 To ensure confidentia lity is not violated, it is the em ployer' s resp onsibility to clea rly define who will receiv e test resu lts and for what purposes. Anytim e an em ployer or servic e agen t release s information to a third party without the em ployee's specific written cons ent, the em ployer or serv ice agent m ust immediately notify the employee in writing of the re lease. The release of test results is only one concern. Y ou m ust also be sensitive to employee expecta tions o f conf identia lity in other aspects of a drug and alcohol program . For exam ple, if it becom es widely known that an em ployee has taken a reasonable suspicion te st (even if the test resu lt is negative), that em ployee m ay feel that his/her privacy has been violated. Likewise, if referrals to a tre atment program for rehabilitation becom e a topic of gossip, employees m ay lose faith in your program and becom e distrustful of m anage ment. Therefore, confidentia lity should be applied to all aspects of your substance abuse manage ment program , particularly with respec t to id entifying sp ecific ind ividuals. The general guideline is to apply the sam e high regard for privacy and confidentiality that you would want and expect for yourself. Previously, all grantees, subrecipients, and safety-sensitive contractors covered under the F TA regulations were required to subm it their reports to F TA each year. However, with the publication of 49 CFR Part 655, FTA changed the way system s are to report. Under the new rule, all covered employers are still required to com plete an annual MIS report, but only those employers who are random ly selected are required to subm it their reports to F TA. The sam pling procedure used stratifies the transit agencies in to four groupings: top 40 urban, other large urban, sm all urban, and rural transit agencies. Safety-sens itive contractors are in clude d in the grouping for the transit agency they s erve. All of the top 40 trans it agencies and their safety-s ensitive contractors are required to report every year and are not included in the sam pling process. Fo r the rem aining agencies, a sampling method used renders a 95 percent confidence interval at the +/- 0.5 percent precision level. As a result, in 2001, 70 large urban, 55 sm all urban, and 188 rural agencies were random ly selected. Including the 40 largest system s, a total of 353 transit agencies were selected for reporting. When safety-sensitive contractors were added, a total of 802 em ployers were required to subm it MIS reports for calendar year 2001. Section 3. REPORTING FTA requires that tran sit agencies prepare ann ual repo rts summarizing test results [\u00a7655.72] for each calendar y ear. The inf ormation is u sed to m onitor th e success of the FTA drug and alcohol testing program and to determ ine the annual random drug and alcoho l testing rates for future years. The standard Managem ent Inform ation System (MIS) reports th at must be used are contained in 49 CFR Par t 655, Appendix A. The for ms can also be downloaded from FTA's hom epage at http://transit-safety.volpe.dot.gov/D AMIS. Chapter 10. Adm inistrative Requirem ents 10-9 August 2002 The list of random ly selected transit agencies is created at the end of each calendar year. Each of the selected employers is sent a notification and reporting package directly. Section 5311 subrecip ients are con tacted directly with a separa te notif ication to th eir respective state. The selected employers are requ ired to subm it their reports using the MIS form s in their packag e, or subm it their respon ses electronically. Many em ployers have found that the use of master lo gs that are u sed to track drug and alcohol tests throughout the year can ease the task of com pleting the MIS reports. Instead of wading thr ough individual test records, the m aster logs can sim ply be consulted for the necessary inform ation. Master logs can also b e used to ass ist the DAPM in overseeing and m anaging the program . The accuracy of the data reported an d the statistica l validity of the sam ple selec tion method is critical as the infor mation obtained is the basis for establishing future minimum random drug a nd alcohol testing rates. Once the MIS rep orts are received from the selected em ployers, an av erage random positive test rate is calculated for each of the four tran sit size grouping s. The test rates are weighted based on the estim ated number of individual drug tests for each gro up. The overall weighted average is th e value us ed to determ ine the minimum random rate. If the weighted average random rate for drugs is 1.0 percent or more, the m inimum drug rando m test ra te will r emain at 50 percen t. If the weighted average rate is les s than 1.0 percent for 2 consecutive years, the minimum random rate will b e lowere d to 25 percent. If it subsequently, rises above 1.0 percent for any single year, the m inimum drug rando m test ra te will r ise ag ain to 50 percen t. If the weighted averag e rate for alcoh ol remains below 0.5 percent, the m inimum alcohol rand om test rate will rem ain at 10 percen t. If the weighted average rate exceeds 0.5 percen t, but is below 1.0 percen t for 1 year, the m inimum alcohol random rate will be incre ased to 25 p ercent. If the weighted av erage rate fo r alcoho l exceeds 1.0 percent for a single year, the m inimum alcohol random rate will be established at 50 percen t. Each of the selected em ployers m ust subm it their annual reports to FTA's Drug and Alcohol Managem ent Inform ation System office by March 15 following each calendar year. States m ust review the reports of their Section 5311 subrecipients for accuracy prior to the ir subm ittal to FTA. Employers have the option to subm it their responses in hard copy or CD-ROM. Internet reporting will be an option in the future. If an em ployer is a m ember of a testing consortium , that cons ortium must provide the required inform ation to the em ployer. The em ployer m ay either com pile its annual report from reports provided by the consortium , or the em ployer m ay require the consortium to prepare the annual report. In either cas e, the em ployer m ust reserv e adequate tim e to review the data provided by the consortium and subm it its report by March 15. Even if the consortium maintains the em ployers' record s and prepares the employers' reports, the employer is still responsible for the re port's accuracy and timely submission. Section 4. CERTIFICATI ONS Urban system s that receive funding directly through Section 5307 or 5309 from Chapter 10. Adm inistrative Requirem ents 10-10 August 2002 If you receiv e more than $25,000 in funding directly from FTA, you m ust also certify com pliance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988. A copy of the required Drug-Free W orkplace Act certification is included in Chapter 13. The certification is norm ally subm itted to your regional FTA office at the sam e time as, and as part of, your gr ant application. S ee Chapter 13 for a detailed discussion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988. FTA m ust certify annually that they are in compliance with the alcohol and drug testing regulations as part of their Annual L ist of Certif ications and Assura nces f or FTA Grants and Cooperative Agreem ents. Rural system s that receive FTA Section 5311, 5307, or 5309 funding through a state departm ent of trans portation do not certify direc tly to FTA; rathe r the sta te must cer tify annually on their behalf. Most states require their subre cipients to ce rtify com pliance as part of the state annual grant subm ission. In instan ces where a rural system does not subm it a grant application annually, the state should requ ire annual letters from each, certifying compliance with the drug and alcohol testing regulations. Section 5. SANCTIONS If you do not institute a program including all of the elements required by the applicable regulations, your agency can lose its FTA funding. Sample letters of certification can be found in the Sa mple Docum entation section of Chapter 2, \"Regulatory Overview.\" You should be very careful in preparing both your reports and your certifications. Neither should be prepared or signed casually. It is especially im portant to ensure that your governing board or senior officials who will sig n (or autho rize you to s ign) annual reports and certifications are f ully inform ed on a regular basis about the status and activities of the program . Your certification m ust be authorized by your governing board (if you have one), or by another authorized official. You should review your program and ensure its compliance prior to signing.

CONS ORTIA AND THIRD PARTY ADMI NISTRATORS Implementing your drug and alcohol program is a significant undertaking as it involves planning, contracting, administrative, legal, and m onitoring efforts. Even large tran sit agen cies find these responsibilities am ong the m ost complex and dem anding elem ents of their saf ety program s. Sm all transit agencies m ay be m ore seriously challenged. One way to reduce program burdens and associated costs that trans it agencies and transportation em ployers have tried successf ully is the f ormation of consortia and the use of third party adm inistrators to adm inister and obtain testing and related services. C onsortia/Third Party Adm inistrators (C/TPA) are defined in \u00a740.3 as service agents that provide or coordinate the provisi on of a variety of drug and alcohol tes ting services to employers. Consortium s typically perform administrative tasks con cerning the operation of the em ployer's drug and alcohol testing program s. This term is usually applied to groups of e mployers who join tog ether as a s ingle entity to administer the DOT drug and alcohol testing program s of its mem bers. TPAs usually provide a com plete package of s ervices that include m ost aspects of drug test ing, alcohol testing and program adm inistration. These services are provided under one contract and for a set price. Third party administrators have different form s and may be called by different nam es. In general, there are two types of TPAs known as \"turnkey vendors\" and \"service bro kers.\" Each type of TPA provides testing servi ces to clients under Chapter 11. Joining a C onsortium 11-1 August 2002 one contract, and bills clients for a variety of services in one invoice. Lower costs Greater exp ertise Reduced adm inistrative burden Turnkey vendors offer a prepackag ed set of services to th e consortium for a fixed price. The servic es typ ically includ e MRO, laboratory, and collection sites. In contrast, a service broker selects individual service agents, defines services to be provided, and negotiates rates for the consortium . Random Pool Maintenance and Selection Reduced lia bility Conf identiality Low er Costs. Because of overhead (e.g., training, record keeping, reporting, billing, and adm inistrative activities) collection sites, drug testing labo ratories, MROs, and SAPs incur sm aller per unit costs when they contract with large employers than when they contract with smaller, individual ones. Consequently, a small em ployer m ay not be able to buy some services. For example, a contract for fewer than 10 tests per year m ay not justify a laboratory's proposal effort. The goal of using a C/T PA is to make service contracting and m onitoring easier. Pref erably, all service issues are handled through a si ngle contact person working for the C/TPA. The C/TPA should be accountable for the perform ance and com pliance of all service agen ts. Trans it agencies, however, cannot legally delegate their compliance responsib ilities to their C/TPA, since the em ployer rem ains ultim ately responsible fo r the ag ency 's compliance. In the m ajority of cases, however, services can be purchased even though the price m ay be higher f or small employers. The per unit cost to an organization purchasing fewer services (for exam ple, drug tests) m ay be significan tly greater th an the per un it costs to a large organization buying more identic al serv ices. FTA encourages transit agencies to form or join consortia and to purchase testing services from a TPA. State departm ents of transportation have also taken an aggressive role in prom oting the form ation of consortia for use by the small urban and rural program s they administer. Exhibit 11-1 in the Sam ple Docum entation section at the end of this chapter describes different exam ples of state involvem ent in consortia developm ent. A consortium allows several organiz ations to com bine their serv ice needs and buy in larg er quantities for a better price. In addition, spreading administrative and other costs am ong more agencies m ay further redu ce th e total cost of drug a nd alcohol testing. Actual savings are determ ined by: 1) the number of consortium mem bers; 2) the total num ber of covered em ployees; 3) the frequency of testing; and 4) the extent of services provided. Savings may be used to offset the cost of employing a professional m anager. Section 1. ADVANTAGES OF CONS ORTIA Transit agen cies that form or join consortia generally do so for one or more of the following reasons: Chapter 11. Joining a C onsortium 11-2 August 2002 Greater Expertise. The FTA and DOT regulations are not sim ple. Although the regulations were carefully crafted, exp erience ind icates that yo u may encounter s ituations where it is not clear what your responsibilities are under the regulations. The regulations purposely leave m any de cisions to local manage ment, which should be included in policy statem ents and operating procedures. Beyond this, no one can anticipate ev ery situation that will arise. keeping and reporting can each be tim e consum ing activities. Together, these activ ities c an be dauntin g to a syste m that wants to operate a first-class safety program . Pooling Resources - An Example A consortium of seven transit agen cies was established to pool talents to meet the FTA reg ulations. Due to the geographic closeness and density of populati ons served by the transit agencies, the consortium members found it helpful to collectively develop as much of the drug and alcohol testing program as they could. Each member contributed its own special areas of exp ertise. The consortium members worked collectively to develop co mmon RFPs , contract specifications, and common language for policy statements. Each transit agency devel oped its own policy and program using parts of the consortium-developed m ateria l. It was especial ly valuable to pool employees a nd obtain better pr ices fo r services like collections and laboratory analysis. A nother advantage was that it gave the organizations a chance to hear other's opinions on how to implement the regulations, as well as differen t \"readings\" or understandings of the regulations. This consortium approach for develop ing a drug and alcohol pro gram is a model o f how multip le trans it agencies, pooling limited resources, can build stronger programs than they could by themselves. Few transit s ystem s can afford to hire a full-tim e DAPM t o adm inister its program . In m ost cases, the administration of the agency's drug and alcohol program is delegated to som eone in the organization who has m any other responsibilities. This is especially true in sm all rura l transit system s. Joining a consortium allows employers to pool resources to hire a professional m anager with specialized knowledge and experience. The consortium manager can devote his/her full attention to the testing requirements, and can provide oversight to the drug and alcohol program s of m ember organizations. Depending upon the size of the consortium , the manager m ay be full or part-tim e, and his/her salary, as well as consortium expenses m ay be recovered with testing cost savings. Reduced Administrative Burden. The adm inistrative burden of operating a program that com plies with th e regulations can be substantial. Procuring services, training em ployees and program personnel, m aintaining colle ction e quipm ent and f acilities, maintaining the random pool, completing random selection and notification, assuring qu ality, and record A consortium can m anage m any of these prog ram-related ac tivitie s. By pooling adm inistrative functions, a consortium may save its m embers tim e Chapter 11. Joining a C onsortium 11-3 August 2002 and effort. Because the services are provided for all em ployers, individual costs to an employer m ay be less than if each em ployer were to provide these services on its own. Random Po ol Maintenance and Selection. Beyond cost savings and expertise co mes practica lity in maintaining a random pool and selecting employees for random tests. This can be particula rly dif ficult f or small syste ms. With only one saf ety-sensitive employee, it is clear who will be selected. The regulations perm it consortia to pool the safety-sensitive em ployees of members for the purposes of random testing. Thus, testing at the required rates is e asier, and the re is less predic tability regard ing who will be tested. Larger pools adm inistered by a third party are also perceived by employees as being m ore objective and impartial, s ince the s election pro cess is outside the direct control of the employer. Therefore, the em ployee is less likely to charge abuse or harassm ent. Reduced Liability. Transit operato rs are righ tly concerned about testing prog ram liabilitie s. The FTA regulations were desi gned to reduce your risks if you are in full compliance with the regu lations. Exposure may relate to either employer action or t echnical liability. Employer action liability corresponds to the norm al risks of all employers in the course of their busin ess. This would include such item s as discrim ination, sexual harassm ent, wrongful discharge, and harassm ent for referring personnel for drug or alcohol testing. Technica l liability r efers to the potential exposure of operating a testing program , including im properly disclosing test results, improperly colle cting /testing spe cimens, and misrepresenting test result consequences. Although employers cannot legally contract away their responsibility to comply with the DOT regulations, a consortium can distance em ployers from the actual op eration of th e testing program , thereby lim iting an em ployer's exposure to technical liability. For exam ple, a well-m anaged consortium may reduce liab ility f or improper disclosure of individual test results, improper collection procedures, and mishandling conf identia lity and s ecurity of testing records. Confidentia lity. Having a consortium manage parts of a testing program with its own separate staff m ay enhance th e impartiality, professionalism , and conf identia lity of the testing program , thereby reducing employee apprehension regarding the inappropriate release of testing inform ation. Employers should be diligent in selecting a consortium and m onitoring perform ance. Em ployers should consult their attorneys for specific inform ation regarding how to structure and operate a consortium to decrease liabilities. Chapter 11. Joining a C onsortium 11-4 August 2002 Section 2. CONSIDERATIONS IN ES TABLISHING CONS ORTIA Although there are m any advantages, particula rly for small transit ope rators, to establish consortia, the advantages have a \"cost.\" Consider those costs to your organization prior to establishing or joining a co nsortium and allow f or the following: Shared design Reduced co ntrol Financia l considera tions Adm inistrative burden Shared Design. Often, em ployers establish the consortium 's operating policies and procedures by consensus. This process enables the consortium to achieve its various goals while addressing the needs of its individual members, which will req uire som e level of com promise. Consequently, you m ay need to com promise on som e elem ents of your program design and confor m to the design wishes of other consortium members. For exam ple, you m ay join a consortium that provides services that comply with the FTA and DOT regulations, but m ay not provide other elem ents that you consider im portant (e.g., m onthly random number selections rather than quarterly). Accordingly, you may need to contract for these services on your own, or settle for a less than optim um design. Reduced Control. By joining a consortium , each em ployer loses operational autonom y over its testing program . If you operated your own program , your agency's DAPM would be solely responsible for its administration following policies and procedures under your sole control. This will not b e the case in a consortium . As a result, it will b e more dif ficult and tim e consum ing to effect changes in the program . Conversely, the consortium may make changes that you do not agree with, but are powerless to avoid. In addition, tim ely services m ay be difficult to ensure, such as obtaining records or resolving problem s. Your best protection against reduced control is a sound c ontract with the consortium . While you still m ay not be able to effect cha nges by yourself, you can ensure com pliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You might also lim it the consortium 's ability to make changes without your approval and provide for prom pt withdrawal if warranted. Financial C onsiderations. Although a consortium should reduce your substance abuse program costs, financial risks do exist. Failure of som e consortium members to pay their costs may increase the burden on others under some consortia m odels. Consortia usually require a membership fee when you join, in addition to paym ents for testing services. This fee m ay include the provision of initial serv ices such as p olicy developm ent or educational m aterials. Charging a m embership fee is a reasonab le and common practice, and in virtu ally all cases th e membership fee will be less than the in itial inve stment of an in-house program . Nonetheless, the membership fee m ay be several tim es the cost of a single drug test, and sm all agencies that anticipate joining consortia should expect the fee and budget accord ingly. Chapter 11. Joining a C onsortium 11-5 August 2002 Mem bers of a consortium that incorpor ate all of its m embers into a single random pool m ay not be able to anticipate th e exact num ber of rando m tests that will be conducted on their employees. Even though the pool as a whole m ust meet the m inimum criteria for drug and alcohol tests (50 percent for drugs and 10 percent for alcohol), individual employers may have m ore or fewer tests given the \"luck of the draw.\" For exam ple, a trans it system with 10 safety-sensitive em ployees would conduct 5 random tests if they were in a random pool of their own. However, this sam e system may conduct seven tests one year and two tests the next as part of a larger consortium . This uncertainty can m ake budgeting difficult. Shared Compliance. Each consortium member will im pact the random testing rate compliance of the other m embers. If the consortium as a whole m eets the cr iteria, then all members are in com pliance. However, if the consor tium falls short of the minimum requirem ents, then all members are out of compliance. Therefore, if you belong to a consortium with em ployers that do not conduct all their rando m tests, rou tinely pu rge their employee lis t, or comm unicate cancelled or om itted tests with the pool administrato r, the conso rtium will not meet its goals and all m embers will b e out of com pliance. This risk can be minimized by aggressive program manage ment and by establishing pools of like-m inded em ployers. Administra tive Burden. The amount of ti me and effor t required to administer a consortium depends upon its size, type, and availab le expertise. Generally, consortia require a great deal of tim e to establish and m aintain. The program requires the dedication and ongoing commit ment of m any people. Problem solving is a tim e-consum ing task and requires significant effort by members. Also, a growing m embership requires in creased inv estments in administration and problem -solving effort s. Section 3. C/TPA LIMITATIONS The C/TPA and/or individual service agents m ay perform most tasks needed to com ply with th e regu lations (see Exhibit 11 -2 in the Sam ple Docum entation section at the end of this chapte r). T he choice of which tasks will be delegated to a C/TPA, however, is left to the discretion of the em ployer. However, there a re som e limitations on the function s that a C/TPA or servic e agent can perform (\u00a740.355). A C/TPA or serv ice ag ent m ust not do the following: Require an employee to sign a consent, release, waive r of liability, or indem nification agreem ent for any part o f the drug or alcohol testing process covered by Part 40; Act as an in termediary in the transm ission of drug test results f rom the labo ratory to the MRO; Transm it drug test resu lts directly from the laboratory to the em ployer--all employer interaction with the laboratory must be through the MRO; Act as an in termediary in the transm ission of alcohol test Chapter 11. Joining a C onsortium 11-6 August 2002 results ( 0.02) between the BAT and the DER; Act as an in termediary in the transm ission of individual SAP reports to the em ployer; Decide when reasonable suspicion, post accident, return-to-duty, and follow-up tests are n eeded; Make a determ ination that an employee has refused a drug or alcohol test (except for the MRO in the case of an adulterated or substituted test); Act as the D ER; Send additional inform ation to a labo ratory besides the laboratory copy of the CCF; Impose conditions or requirem ents on em ployers not authorized by the regulations; or Inten tiona lly delay th e transm ission of drug or alcohol test results or related docum ents due to a paym ent dispute. Section 4. TYPES OF CONS ORTIA Consortia can provide the sam e services as those available through separate or individual contract arrangem ents (e.g., education and training, specim en collection, laboratory analys is, M RO services ). There are a number of consortia m odels, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Drug and alcohol testing consortia are structured and m anaged in m any different ways. To a large extent, the differences relate to the level of manage ment services the consortium provides. In reviewing consortium models, distinguish betw een the administrative serv ices the consortium provides and the testing services the consortium procures. Adm inistrative services include: organizing the consortium and developing a written agreem ent a mong members, developing bids for testing services and contracting with selected servic e agen ts, m onitorin identifying and implem enting correctiv e action s when necessary, and record keeping and reporting. T esting services include: urine specim en collection, laboratory analys is, M RO services, BAT/STT alcohol testing services, and in som e cases, SAPs. Three consortium models for administrative services are: Purchasing cooperative Separate m anagem ent entity Managing partner Purchasing Cooperative. In a cooperative purchasing model, the consortium seeks services at a reduced price by taking advantage of large- volum e buying power and m anagem ent efficiencies. The consortium negotiates terms and conditions w ith service agents, but generally provides no other manage ment services. Once a suitable pricing schedule is estab lished, s ervice agents deal directly with each ind ividual participa ting agency. Although the purchasing cooperative model should help sm all agencies obtain needed services at reduced prices, it generally does not provide the administrative services required of a Chapter 11. Joining a C onsortium 11-7 August 2002 complete drug and alcohol testing program , such as m onitoring service agents, training, record keeping, etc. This m odel, although in use today by several trans it agen cies, is not technically considered a consortium under the F TA regulations, since the participating agencies have no ongoing relationship beyond the initial purchase arrang ement. Separate M anagement Entity. In a separa te managem ent entity m odel, the consortium provides m ore extensive manage ment functions for m ember agencies. The consortium m ay assist member agencies by m onitoring and training em ployees, preparing reports, and procuring testing services at reduced prices. Member agencies sign an agreem ent, which specif ies the manage ment responsibilities of the consortium , how costs will b e shar ed, and how testing will b e achieved. Often, a state trans it ass ociation or a state departm ent of transporta tion ta kes the lead in establishing the consortium. The lead agency m ay hire staff and manage the program itself, or m ore commonly, contract with a TPA to perform managem ent functions and procure testing services from individual service agen ts. This m odel requires strong leadership and agency comm itment. A consortium adm inistrator who is knowledgeable about the testing regulations, contracti ng, and the needs of the consor tium members is requ ired to provide oversight of the TPA or individual service agents. The cost of managing and operating the consortium is in addition to the cost of purchasing drug and alcohol testing services. However, the adm inistrative co sts are spread am ong the m ember agencies. Either conso rtium staff or a TPA obtain testing services. In-house manage ment requires a staff large enough to o versee each of the individual service contracts, process billing, and perform adm inistrativ e functions of the consortium . Hiring a TP A allows for a single point of c ontrol between the consortium and the individual service agents. The TPA should have demonstrated expertise with the DOT testing program . The TPA is essentially a general contractor, who subcontracts with other service agents to provide the full package of testing services required. The separate m anagem ent entity model provides m embers with manage ment expertise and avoids the costs each mem ber woul d otherwise be forced to absorb in the hiring or training of its own expert. W hile this m odel provides expertise and f lexibility in manage ment, this high level of service may be expe nsive. Also, TPAs have limitations (previously discussed in Section 3) that m ust be taken into Chapter 11. Joining a C onsortium 11-8 August 2002 Managing Partner. In a r model, typ ically sm aller tran sit agencies co ntract for services with a larger organization that is also subject to USDOT testing regulations. This could be a city or county, transit agency, or school district. The larger organization utilizes its staff and resources to m anage its own testing program , and simultaneously provides staff tim e to the other en tities in ad ministering their testing program s. This is typically done on a fee basis, thereby providing an econom ic benefit to both the m anaging partner and the other m ember entities. The larger organization becom es the managing partner with the responsibility of ensuring the testing needs of its smaller partners are m et. The m anaging partner m odel could be an option for an agency that cannot afford their own professional m anagem ent of the drug and alcohol testing program . However, the sm aller a gency m ust be willing to give up control and m ay becom e overdependent on the m anaging partner's knowledge and expertise. consideration. Thus, the m ore diverse the needs of the c onsortium members, the m ore dif ficult th is model will be to implem ent ef fectively. If you believe the separate entity model is best, you can either create a new one, or join an existing one. If you join an existing consortium , rem ember that other transportation modes subject to their own USDOT regulations m ay have regulatory requirem ents that differ from those of the tr ansit industry. You must ensure that the cons ortium will always comply with the FTA regulations in all resp ects. In addition, if the existing consortium does not provide all required services, you m ust make separate arrangem ents for those services. Your system m ight provide them internally or purchase th em elsewhere. Form ing a new consortium may be best to ensur e that the co nsortium will be fully com pliant with FT A regulations. If you pursue this m odel, you will need to identify other tran sit agencies interes ted in participating. Your personal network, state transit asso ciation, or state departm ent of transportation m ay be useful in identifyi ng other interested trans it agencies, jus t as they m ight be useful in helping you identify existing consortia that you m ight choose to join. If you are a sm all transit operator with a neigh boring large trans it sys tem, the m anaging partner m odel m ay be an attractive ch oice. Contact the larg e trans it ope rator to d etermine how that operator is m eeting the drug and alcohol regulations. Many la rge agencies have had their own program for m any years, and they m ay be able to accomm odate your needs without a lot of effort or expense. In most cases, estab lishing a consortium will r equire forming a le gal entity. The consortium would probably operate as a nonprofit corporation. T he consortium would have power to conduct business, enter into contracts, and legally represen t members according to a charter and bylaws. A governing board of the m embers would be responsible for supervising the consortium . Chapter 11.

T his distance m ay minimize issues concerning confidentiality or the in tegrity of the testin g process. Although consortium membership may offer significant ad vantages, th ere are also potential disadvantages, which should be considered. C onsider available resources and your need or desire for sp ecific se rvices before deciding to join a consortium . Does the consortium have members regulated by other DOT agencies ? First, identify your agency's specific needs: Will the consortium be comprised of members that fall under the FTA, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Adm inistra tion (FMCSA), other m odal adm inistrations, or som e combination thereof ? While the te sting requirem ents by them selves have essentially parallel components, there are differences in policy orientation that should be taken in to considera tion. Will this im pact the quality of service you are provided? Consider the num ber and types of tes ts you will b e conducting, where the testing will be pe rformed, and the hours when testing m ay be required. T he num ber of tests n eeded will be an indicator of the am ount of time required to oversee the program and determ ine potential cost savings that may be achieved in a consortium . The random selection process must be acceptable. W ill a larger pool ensure the credib ility o f the test? W ill confidentiality be enhanced? Will em ployees per ceive the selection process to be objective? Next, find out what staffing, financial, and legal resources are available internally. Your staff's size, expertise, an d their availability will determ ine how m uch of your testing program can be in-house. Testing program s require a significant am ount of time to set up. Efforts must be m ade to train supervisors and em ployers, procure servic es, m onitor s ervice agent perform ance, oversee billing, and prepare reports. The size of your service area will af fect y our needs. Are service agen ts read ily available in your service area, or do you need help identifying s ervice agents that are willing and able to meet all of your needs? The f inancia l resou rces a vailab le to your agency are another factor. W hen analyzing co sts, cons ider the cos t per Chapter 11. Joining a C onsortium 11-11 August 2002 test and the adm inistrative costs. Given the existing dem ands on your staff, it may be less expensive in the aggregate to purchas e adm inistrative services f rom another entity rather than providing those services on an in-house basis. You should also consider if your agency has the necessary legal resou rces and expertise av ailab le to gu ide the developm ent and im plem entation of your program. Is it better to have an independent, professional third party involved to help with program compliance? Exhibit 11-3 (located in the Sam ple Docum entation section) defines consortium responsibilities for the four major program parts. Which of these functions can your agency perform ? Which should be left to a C/TPA? After evaluating your needs and available res ources, th en decide if consortium membership is the best option for your orga nization. There are no uniform criteria for answering this question. In the end, your agency is responsible for full im plementation of your drug and alcohol testing program, regardless of whether or not you contract for individual testing services. If, after weighing the ad vantages an d disadvantages, you determ ine a consortium membership is the best approach, decide whether to join an existing consortium , or if you need to work with others to develop a new consortium to m eet your specific needs. The Drug and Alcohol Consortia Manual , prepared for the Ohio Departm ent of Transportation in 1996 and reprinted and distributed by the FTA, provides guidance on how to design, establish, and administer a drug and alcohol testing consortium . This publication should be consulted for additional background infor mation, sample procurem ent docum ents, contracts, m ember agency Mem orandum of Agreem ent. Section 6. THE IM PORTANCE OF YOUR CONS ORTIUM CONTRACT Regardless of the consortium model you select, you should realize that you are en tering into a con tractual relationship, and your interests should be protected. Although you are following the regulations through a consortium , you rem ain responsible to FTA for compliance. This m eans that if the consortium is im plementing som e aspect of the program incorrectly, your system is im plem enting it incorrectly. You should exercise due d iligence in selecting a consortium , and in monitoring its operations. Federal law prohibits FT A from funding your transit syst em if it is out of compliance with alcohol m isuse or prohibited drug regulations. Therefore, you m ust exercise your best manage ment practices both before and after you select or establish a consortium . Depending on your needs and those of other consortium members, you m ay purchase a variety of required or optional services offered by the consortium . Som e consortia require members to purchase all their serv ices, where others allow you to buy only those you need. Consortium assistance might include the following: Policy developm ent Chapter 11.

National and regional C/T PAs provide services of varying quality. Some are ex cellent and m ay provide you with a better program than you could operate on your own.

Joining a C onsortium 11-17 August 2002 Exhibit 11-1 Role of State DOTs in Consortia Formulation In the i nfancy of the DOT drug and alcohol testing program, several DOTs fo rmed advisory panels to i dentify some of the key issues facing transit operators, notably small t ransit operat ors in very rural areas. Many concluded that a consorti um approach would represent the best solution, and worked with the transit systems to de termine service needs, test vo lumes, and ot her specifics. State DOTs have also hel ped establish consortiu ms by providing grants to tra nsit districts or associations t o orga nize an d manage co nsortiums. For example, in one case a transit district repre senting several tr ansit agencie s within a state developed a request for proposal (RFP) for turnkey management of a TPA. After mailing RFPs to prospective vendors, the transit district and the state DOT jointly interviewed four finalists and chose a TPA. The transit district monitors the program and the TP A, and receives summary statistical reports. The TPA provides all servic es incl uding random selection, collection and laboratory services, MRO, BAT, and liti gation sup port. The TPA also provides a 24- hour hotline staffed by knowledgeable professionals ready to respond to any employee testing situation. The consort ium manager says she \"wo uld not run a program any other way tha n with a consortium and TPA\" bec ause the appr oach promot es high ce, consistency, and confidentialit y. In a nother state, the DOT needed to h elp transit op erators who had n o progra ms. M otor carriers in the state had be en subject to FHW A/FMCSA drug testi ng regulati ons for some time and had com plied with th ose regulation s through the establishment of a co nsortium managed by one of the mo tor carrier co mpanies. Th e DOT approached the con sortium to det ermine wheth er it could serve the transit industry. The consortium agreed. In a relativ ely short time, policies were developed and inf ormational and educ ation materials were printed and distribut ed to all t he transit systems. Personnel from the consortium and t he DOT delive red training sessions regionally. Despite the fact that parts of the state are quite rural, the consortium is able to provide one to three collection sit es in 30- to 50-mile radii from each transit system. The c onsortium added mobile vans for collection. The unions have been very supporti ve of the state program and of the consor tium. There have been no labor disagreement s over the program.

PROGRAM MONI TORING As a result, transit system s should period ically assess th e compliance of their program , re-evaluate their program needs, assess their level of sa tisfaction with curren t service agen ts, and apraise the prog ram's benefits. As an FTA grantee/sub recipient, yo u can contract out your drug and alcohol testing program functions, but you cannot contract away your com pliance responsibilities. If your service agents do not perform testing services consistent with the regulations, your agency's good faith effort is not a defense to a DOT enfor cement action [\u00a740.15(c)] (i.e., loss of FTA funds). You are always accountable for noncomp liance, whether it's your own program , or you outsource to contra ctors who perf orm saf ety-sen sitive functions. You m ust ensure tha t contractors meet the reg ulatory requ irements an d their respective s ervice agen ts have the required qualifications. In order to rem ain in compliance, you m ust take whatever action is neces sary to ensure co mpliance. Section 1. PROG RAM MANAGEMENT Prior to im plem entation of their drug and alcohol testing program s, many transit managers expressed concern regarding the cost of the program and the subsequent burden it would have on their operating environm ent. Now that several years have passed, m ost of these concerns have not materialized or have been overcom e. For the m ost part, testing program s are operating smoothly and have becom e part of the Chapter 12. Program Monitoring 12-1 August 2002 standard operating pr ocedures of transit system s, large and sm all. However, you should objectively evaluate your program to ensure that policies and procedures have been updated and its integ rity rem ains intac t. Age ncies often find that as dr ug and alcohol testing program s becom e engrained within an organization, com pliance can be compromised over tim e as the program evolves and com ponents are m odified to reflect the o perationa l realities of the system . If the DAPM is not diligent in his/her oversight re sponsibilities, the program may be m odifie d out of compliance. Seem ingly sim ple and innocuous changes m ay have significant implications. Thus, a comprehensive assessm ent is recomm ended. FTA has produced a self- assessm ent checklist that can be us ed to identif y inco rrect or om itted com ponents of a program , or as an oversight tool to assess compliance. A copy of this checklist is provided in Appendix J. DAPMs m ay also wish to periodically assess the co st and bene fit of the program . This information can be helpful for board members, system managem ent, elected officials, and others who wish to quantify the cos t-effectiven ess an d overall worth of the program . Assessing the program period ically based on ac tual expe rience will ensure that the true benefits and costs to the organization are being identified. The cost- benefit analysis should include at a minimum the out-of-pocket cost of the program , employee productivity, number of positiv e test results, na ture of acciden ts, absenteeism , worker's compensation claim s, and insurance prem ium savings. Other intangibles that may be assessed include em ployee morale, union/m anagem ent relations, agency/m anagem ent credibility, pub lic relations, and system image. Section 2. SERVICE AG ENT MONI TORING Since the regulations were first published, the testing industry has gone through an evolution with service agents entering and leaving the m arket, while others have m erged to form large consortia or third party adm inistrators (C/TPA ). At the sam e time, the transit industry has matured through its increased knowledge and experience base. T he regulations m ake it clear that em ployers are respon sible for ensuring their service ag ents m eet the qualifications set forth in Part 40. An employer also has an affirm ative responsibility to get needed inform ation from service agents to docum ent compliance. Service age nts must follow the DOT regulations (Part 40). H owever, the employer rem ains accountable to DOT/FTA for com pliance. Failu re of the service agent to im plement any aspect of Part 40 as required, results in the noncom pliance of the employer. All agreem ents and arrang ements, written or unwritten, between employers and service agents concerning the implementation of DOT drug and alcohol testing requ irements are deem ed, as a m atter of law, to require com pliance with all applicable provisions of the DOT/FTA drug and alcohol testing re gulations [\u00a740.11(c)]. Even though the regulation does not stipulate how an e mployer should monitor its se rvice a gents, th e following ac tivities have become standard industry practice: Conduct periodic m ock collections to identify procedural flaws. Chapter 12. Program Monitoring 12-2 August 2002 A PIE is a serious action that the DOT takes to protect the publ ic interest and to ensure that covered em ployers deal only with responsible service agents. The DOT intends to use PIEs to rem edy situations of serious noncom pliance, but not as punishm ent. The process for initiating a PIE is described in the chart on the f ollowing page. Conduct periodic review of service agen t employee credentials including training docum entation. Investigate any em ploye e reports of flawed procedures. Provide service agents w ith copies of appropriate D OT guidelines, regulations, and related m aterials. The scope of a PIE can reach beyond the service agent in question to other divisions such as othe r corpor ate d ivision s, affiliates, individu als, or serv ice ag ents th at are involved with or affected by the noncom pliance that is the basis for the PIE. The duratio n of a PIE will b e betwee n 1 and 5 years. Although not a regulatory requirem ent, recomm end that service agents hold memberships with the ir respec tive in dustry' s trade association or otherwise demonstrate m ethods for remaining up to date. Monitor cancelled tests and require detailed explanations for each. Service agents who receive a PIE will be placed on a \"List of Excluded Drug and Alcohol Service Agents\" published on the DOT's W eb site at: www.dot.gov/ost/dapc and in the F ederal Register. The service agent m ust also notify in writing each of its DOT regulated em ployers for which it perform s services of the PIE. The notice must be sent within 3 business days from issuance of the PIE. Include m inimum perfor mance standards in contracts that provide disincentives for cancelled tests or non- perform ance. If a service agent is unwilling or unable to perf orm their du ties c onsisten t with the regulations, cancel thei r contract and obtain service elsewhere. Once an employer is not ified that one of its service agents has received a P IE, the employer must stop usin g their services no later than 90 days after the DOT has published th e notic e in the Federal Register or posted it on its W eb site. Under Subpart R of Part 40, em ployers also have another rec ourse. If a service agent fails or refuses to provide testing servic es con sisten t with the regulatio ns or fails to cooperate with D OT or e mployer oversigh t activitie s, the DOT m ay institu te a Public In terest Exclu sion (PIE) tha t excludes that vendor from partic ipating in the DOT's drug and alcohol testing program . There must be serious uncorrected noncompliance violations that affect safety, test results, privacy, employee due process, integrity of the testing program , or a lack of cooperation with the DOT to warran t the issu ance of a PIE. The issuance of a PIE does not result in the cancellation of drug or alcohol tests conducted by the service agent. Chapter 12. Program Monitoring 12-3 August 2002 Steps to Initiate a PIE 1. The noncompliance issue is brought to the attent ion of the Office of Drug and Alcohol Policy and Co mpliance (ODAPC) or the drug and alcohol program manage r of a DOT agency. Em ployers covered under the FTA regulations should contact Mark Snider, Office of Safety and Security at (202) 366-2896. 2. The DOT agency will co nduct fact-fi nding to determ ine the extent and nature of the noncom pliance issue. Infor mation will be ob tained le sou rces and the servic e agen t will b e contacted to obtain relevant inform ation. 3. If the situation warrants, the in itiating official will send a correction notice to the servic e age nt iden tifying the spec ific area s that must be corrected to avoid a PIE proceed ing. 4. If the service agent does not m ake and docum ent changes within 60 days of the notice, the initiating o fficial will start a PIE proceeding by sending the service agent a Notice of Proposed Exclusion (NOPE). The NOPE will s tate the f actual bas is for initiating th e PIE and th e initia ting officials recomm endation for the sc ope and duration of the PIE. 5. The inform ation presented in the N OPE will be provided to the ODAPC Director or his/her designee for consideration when determ ining whether to issue a PIE. The servi ce agent m ay contest the proposed PIE within 30 days of receip t of the NOP E. The burden of proof is on the initiating official to dem onstrate (by a preponderance of the evidence) that the serv ice agen t is in serious noncom pliance with the regulations. The PIE proceedings will be conducte d in a fair and inform al manner. 6. Based on the inform ation provided, the ODAP C Director or his/her designee will determ ine if a PIE is warranted, its scope and duration. The determ ination will be m ade within 60 days of the date of record completion. The service agent will receive written notice of the PIE. Section 3. CONTRACTOR OVERSI GHT As the FTA grantee/sub recipient, yo u are fully responsible for the com pliance of your system with the drug and alcohol testing regulations, including your contra ctors who perf orm saf ety-sen sitive job functions. While m aintenance contractors for FTA recipients of Section 5309 and 5307 funding that serve a population of 200,000 or less (as d elineated by the FTA apportionm ent definition) and Section 5311 rural funding recipients are exem pt, all others m ust meet the sam e standard of compliance as the grantee/subrecip ients them selves. Therefore, you m ust oversee your contractors to ensure co mpliance an d certify their com pliance to FTA as part of your annual com pliance certification. You should not assum e that your contractors are know ledgeable of the regulatory requirem ents or that they have compliant policies or program s. Even though the regulation do es not specify the nature or extent of your oversight duties, it is your responsibility to take whatever action s are n ecessary to ensure their Chapter 12. Program Monitoring 12-4 August 2002 compliance. You are encouraged to communicate the requirem ents to your contractors, and if neces sary, prov ide them with tools and technical assis tance, s uch as the followin g: Provide copies of the regulations (Part 655 and Part 40). Provide copies of resource materials: Implementation Guideline s; Best Practic es manual; Random Drug Testing Manual; and the FTA Drug and Alcohol Regulations Update. Provide contractor DAPMs with education and training on the regulations. Offer substance abuse awareness training to s afety-sens itive employees. Offer reasonable suspicion training for supervisors. Provide assistance in establishing a scien tifically valid rand om selection p rocess. Develop specification and evaluation criteria for service agents. Conduct a detailed policy review. Assist in the estab lishm ent of record keeping procedures. Assist in the preparation of MIS reports. If your contractor(s) is unable to comply, you m ay include them in your own program (e.g., random selection process, testing services). U nder this scenario, the contractor w ill still be responsible fo r program adm inistration, but you will have greater con trol over the technical asp ect of their testing program . You should also conduct ongoing oversight of your contractor(s) to ensure that their program s remain in com pliance. Oversight functions m ight include requiring and m onitoring periodic (e.g., m onthly, quarterly) managem ent reports on policy modification s, changes in service ag ents, training, and the num ber, type, and results of tests. You can also perform mock audits on contractors m imicking the FTA audit process (see Chapter 14 for inform ation on the audit process). The Best Practices manual also discusses contractor oversight and provides exam ples of contactor oversight checklists in Section 4.2 and Appendix C. This checklist can be used to structure the contract or review, docum ent your oversight efforts, and identify areas that require correc tive action. If your agency has direct oversight responsibilities, you m ay also directly access contractor employee records including test results. You m ust take whatever action s are necessary and appropriate to ensure contractor com pliance. If a contractor is unwilling o r unable to c omply with the regulations, you m ust discontinue using this contra ctor f or safety-sensitive dutie s, or jeopardize your FTA funding. Contractors that bid on safety-sensitive work should be considered non-respons ive if they do not have or are not able to establish an F TA- compliant drug and alcohol testing program . Section 4. STATE OVERSIGHT OF S UBRECIPI ENT The FTA regulation (\u00a7655.81) requires that each grantee in cluding states, en sure that recipients of funds under 49 U.S.C. Chapter 12. Program Monitoring 12-5 August 2002 5307, 5309, 5311, or 23 U.S.C. 103( e)(4) comply with this part. T he regulation (\u00a7655.82(c)) also requ ires that each state certify com pliance on behalf of its subrecipients of these funding program s. In order to provide the certification, the state must ensure that each su brecip ient is in compliance with Part 655 and Part 40. If a subrecip ient is not in co mpliance with the regulations, the state m ay suspend its funding. FTA does not specify what actions must be taken by states to ensure subrecipient compliance, but they are encouraged to develop an oversight program that provides a reason able level of con fidence that their subrecip ients are com plying before th ey certify com pliance. Successful oversight activities include policy review, ongoing training, technical assistance and compliance checklists. The Best Practices manual provides add itional inf ormation and exam ples of monitoring f orms and checklists fo r state DOTs (Section 4.2 and Appendix C). Policy r eviews are inf ormative, and several states evaluate th eir sub recipient's polic ies to m ake certain that ev ery system has a policy in place and that its contents comply. These states have found the reviews usef ul becaus e they often reveal th e nature and extent of a subrecipient's compliance problem s. Inform ation sharing and training are also effective ov ersigh t activ ities. Mos t states have provided som e level of training for their subrecipients. A few states have supplem ented their in itial training by providing refresher courses to inform subrecipients of regul atory changes, new interpretations, and ways to avoid common mistakes. Several states have also developed resource lib raries that are available to subrecipients and have dissem inated inform ation through newsletters, alerts, em ails, and faxes. Some states have developed m onitoring program s that require subrecipients to complete comprehensive checklists and provide docum entation showing how they complied with each regu latory requ irement. A review of the check lists enables the state to identify problem s and require the subrecip ients to tak e corrective actio ns. Other states have included abbreviated testing program checklists in their ongoing regulatory com pliance review process. Regardless of the m ethods used, each state should be comm itted to the p rogram and should take their oversight responsibilities seri ously. Oversight program s that successf ully identify problem areas and initia te cor rective actions will enhance th e integ rity of each subrecipient's testing program , minimize com pliance issues, avo id potential legal conflicts, and improve the overall effectiveness of the program . Chapter 12. Program Monitoring 12-6 August 2002 Chapter 1 3. THE DRUG- FREE WORKPLACE ACT OF 1988 Congress enacted the Drug-Free Workplace Act (DFW A) of 1988 on Nove mber 18, 1988. This act (Pub. L. 100- 690, title V, subtitle D) requires direct recipients of $25,000 or more of fede ral funds to certify that they will provide drug-free workplaces for their employees. Th e certification is a precondition for receiving a contract or grant from a federal agency. Agencies receiving large urban or discretionary funds (Section 5307 or 5309) direc tly from FTA must com ply with the DFWA. They m ust certify com pliance in th eir annual grant application certification and assurances. Rural transit system s that receive Section 5311 and/or Section 5309 funding are subrecipients of FTA as the funding program s are adm inistered through their respective state DOTs. Most state DOTs pass along the certification requirem ent to their subrecipients and require a com pliance cer tification in the ir annual grant applications. Even though this act addresses drug use in the federal workplace, it is sep arate and distinct from the FTA drug and alcohol testing rules. Compliance with one does not necessarily m ean com pliance with the other; nor does one supercede the other. Most transit system s will have to comply with both. The Drug-Free W orkplace Act of 1988 is reprinted in Appendix I of these guidelines. Section 1. REQUI REMENTS To com ply with the a ct, recip ients must certif y that they will p rovide a drug -free workplace b y doing the f ollowing: Publish and distribute a written policy on substance abuse that notifies employees that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, August 2002 13-1Chapter 13. The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 Section 2. GRANT CERTI FICATION possession, or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in the workplace. For the purp oses of this act, th e term \"grant\" includes only dir ect assis tance from FTA to a grantee. If a federal agency provides financial ass istance to a state, which in turn passes th e assistan ce to a trans it agency, only the state ag ency that receives th e ass istance direc tly (and not the loca l transit age ncy) is required to m ake a drug-free certification under the regulation. Make an ongoing, good faith effort to maintain a drug-free workplace. Establish an ongoing employee education program that infor ms employees of the dangers of drug abuse, the employer's w ritten policy provisions, the availability of drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistan ce pro grams, and the possible penalties for drug abuse violations occurring in the workplace. Every gran tee, excep t a state, m ust certify for each grant. A state m ay elect to make a single annual certif ication to the FT A, rather than m aking a separate certification for each grant. Require each em ployee to abide by the company's written policy and to notify the transit agency within 5 days of any criminal dru g statu te con viction for a violation occurring in th e workplace. The FTA DFW A certif ication is pro vided as Exhibit 13-1 in the Sample Docum entation section. Notify the federal governm ent of eac h violation within 10 days of notification of the violation. Section 3. SANCTIONS The im position of sanctions under DFW A requires a w ritten determ ination of violation from the federal \"agency head\" or de signee. The first ground for sanctions is false certification (e.g., an em ployee awareness program was never established). The second is failure to com ply with the requ irements of the certification (e.g., the em ployee awareness program was not ongoing). The third is \"such a num ber of em ployees of the grantee\" have been convicted of crim inal drug statute violations occurring in the workplace \"as to indicate th at the gran tee has failed to make a good faith effort to provide a drug-free workplace.\" Within 30 days following conviction, impose sanctions on the em ployee. These sanctions incl ude (1) appropriate personnel action against the em ployee, up to and including term ination; or (2) requiring the em ployee's satisfactory participa tion in a reh abilitation program approved by a federal, state, or local health, law enforcem ent, or other app ropriate agency. The DFWA does not require or sanction any drug testing. However, the DF WA and the FTA drug and alcohol testing regulation (49 CFR Part 655) com plement one another. Most em ployers write one policy statem ent that addresses the requirem ents of both. In addition, the DFWA exceeds the edu cation and awareness training requirem ents specified in Part 655 by requiring that the education effort be ongoing. Employees' crim inal dru g statu te violations occurring out side the workplace do not trigger sanctions. Likewise, em ployees' drug abuse in the workplace withou t crim inal convictions do not trigger sanctions. August 2002 13-2Chapter 13. The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 Violations of the act m ay result in: (1) suspension of grant paym ents; (2) suspension or term ination of grants; or (3) suspension or debarm ent of the recipient. The decision of which sanction or sanctions to apply in a particular case is left to the discretion of the FTA. A debarred rec ipient is in eligib le for any award from a federal agency during the term of the debarm ent, which m ay be up to 5 years. The agency head m ay waive a particular grant, suspension if it is determ ined by the agency head that s uch a waiver would be in the pu blic inte rest. This autho rity canno t be delegated to any other federal official. The DFWA does not require em ployers to test for drugs and alcohol or pay for rehabilitation. August 2002 13-3Chapter 13.

SUBS TANCE ABUS E MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT AUDI T The prim ary intent of the Om nibus Transportation Em ployee Testing Act of 1991 is to achieve a drug- and alcohol-free transpo rtation workf orce in the inte rest of the hea lth an d saf ety of employees and the public. The resulting regulations (49 CFR Parts 40 and 655) are designed to deter and detect the illegal use of drugs and m isuse of alcohol by safety-sensitive transit employees. When the regulations were initially published, FTA undertook an aggress ive outreach effort to assis t grante es/sub recip ients in com plying with the new rules. To determ ine com pliance, FTA's Office of Safety and Security began auditing grantee drug and alcoho l testing program s in March, 1997. The audits give FTA the opportunity to provide extensive technical assistance and to obtain a better understanding of the difficulties that grantees encounter when im plementing the rules. In the first 5 years, FTA conducted 335 Substance A buse Managem ent Oversight audits including 105 transit system s, 20 states, and 2 10 state subrecipients an d contractors. The FTA audits as sess c ompliance with FTA drug and alcohol testing regulations (49 CFR Part 655) and appropriate provisions of the DOT testing procedures (49 CFR Part 40). A team of experts, including FTA and Volpe Center staff and private consultants, perf orm the audits. The audit team typically con sists of three to eigh t auditors who spend 2 to 4 days on site Chapter 14. Adm inistrative Requirem ents 14-1 August 2002 The on-site portion of the audit begins 7 weeks f ollowing the f irst notif ication. Every effort is m ade to schedule audits to avoid conflicts with other FTA oversight efforts such as trien nial reviews, financial manage ment oversight reviews, or state manage ment reviews. T he audit is scheduled so as not to be an undue burden, but once the dates are set, they are firm and not negotiable. depending on the size and com plexity of the trans it sys tem. The audit p rocess is comprehensiv e in nature, inclu ding a rev iew of each grantee/sub recipient's p olicies, pro cedures, and record keeping. Each agency's service agents inclu ding collection sites, m edical review officers, substance abuse professionals, and third party adm inistrators, if appropriate, are also interviewed and a mock collec tion is p erformed. Complete audits are also perform ed on a select num ber of grantees /subrecip serv ice agents. These contracto rs are h eld to the same standards as th e direct grantees/sub recip ients. The audit no tification letter will outline the schedu le of the audit as illustrated in the Audit Tim e Line char t on the f ollowing page. The letter will also include an agenda and summ ary of expectations for the audit. The on-site r eview will take 2 to 4 da ys to com plete. The audit team generally completes all on-site questioning and record review within 3 days. On the fourth day, the team com piles the report and the final report is provided to the grantee during an exit interview held on the fifth day. Following the exit interview, you and your safety- sensitive co ntractors an d service ag ents will have 90 days to respond to the audit and resolve any identified def iciencies associated w ith your drug and alcohol testing prog ram. Additio nal audit res ponses may be required following the 90-day period if audit findings have not been com pletely addressed to the sa tisfaction of the FTA. The FTA wi ll notify you of your compliance status within 30 days after receiving a completed response. Transit system s are selected for audits through a process that ensures a repres entative cro ss section of FTA recipients including system size, location, and m ode of operation. System s with compliance issues identif ied in FTA Triennial Reviews or MIS reports will also be candidates for a detailed FTA audit. Transit system s that have previously been audited m ay be selected for a re-audit. Re- audits are lim ited in scope and address the non-com pliant issues identified in the original audit. A detailed discussion of re- audits is provided in Section 5 of this chapter. Section 1. AUDI T TIME LINE The audit process was designed to be completed in 22 weeks. The process is initiated onc e the gr antee is notif ied o f selection, and ends when the grantee receives a lette r of com pliance from FTA. Grantees /subrecip ients are notified d irectly. State DOTs are notified of rural sys tems selected for an audit. Chapter 14.

Americans w ith Disabilities Act Discussion This discussion is reproduced from the February 15, 1994 Federal Register (59 FR 7311) for your reference. The Departm ent referenced here refers to the Departm ent of Transportation. The DOT Office of the Chief Couns el was consulte d to determ ine the continued applicability of the paper. The conclusion was that the paper was still va lid an d appr opriately described the relationship between the ADA and DOT drug and alc ohol testing. Therefor e, it is reprinted herein without any m odification. The Americans w ith Disa bilities Act and DOT Drug and Alcohol Testing The Am ericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) (Pub. L. 101-36) does not, in any way, preclude or interfere with em ployers' com pliance with the D epartm ent's new or existing drug and alcohol testing regulations. However, Title I of the ADA, which prohibits discrim ination against a \"qualified indi vidual with a disability,\" m ay affect the personnel actions an employer might wish to take with respect to so me individuals who tes t positiv e for alcohol o r drugs, or otherwise violate the prohibitions of th e Departm ent's drug and alcohol rules. Title I cove rs employers who have 15 or m ore employees f or more than 2 0 calenda r weeks in a year (\u00a7101 (5)(A)). (U ntil Ju ly 26, 1994, only empl oyers with 25 or m ore such em ployees are covered.) Covered em ployers m ay not discri minate against a qualified individual with a disability with respect to app lications, hiring, advancem ent, di scharge, compensation, or other terms, conditions, or privileges of employm ent (\u00a7102(a)). Before discussing the effect Title I may ha ve on an em ployer's personnel action following a positiv e DOT-m andated drug or alco hol tes t or other violation s of DOT drug and alcoh ol rules, it is im portant to note the specifi c ADA provisions that address DOT drug and alcohol rules. The ADA specifically authorizes em ploye rs covered by DOT regulations to require their employees to com ply with th e stand ards es tablis hed in those regulations, includ ing complying with any rules that ap ply to em ploym ent in saf ety-sen sitive position s as defined in the DOT regulations (\u00a7104\u00a9(5)(C)). By authorizing empl oyers to require em ployees to comply with the standards in DOT rules, this provision authorizes com pliance not only with testing provisions of the rules, but also of other drug- and alcohol -related provisions that affect safety-sensitive em ployees (e.g., pre-duty abstinence, on-the-job us e). The legality under the A DA of e mployer com pliance with DOT drug and alcohol requirem ents, other than those concerni ng testing, is underlined by several other provis ions of Title I. A n employer may prohibit the us e of drugs and alcohol in the workplace, m ay require that em ployees not be u nder the influence of alc ohol, or be engaging in the illegal use of drugs in the workplace, and m ay require that em ployees confor m to the requirem ents for the Dru g-Free W orkplace Ac t (Pub. L. 100-690, Title V, Subtitle D) (\u00a7104(c)(1-3)). Concerning drug and alcohol tes ting and its consequences, the statute further provides that nothing in T itle I shall be construed to encourage, prohibit, restrict, or authorize the oth erwise lawful exerc ise by en tities subjec t to the jur isdiction of the Departm ent of Transportation of authority to (1) test em ployees of such entities in, and applicants for, positions involving safety- Appendix C. ADA Discussion C-1 August 2002 sensitive duties for the illegal use of drugs and for on-duty im pairm ent by alcohol; and (2) remove such persons who test positive for ill egal use of drugs and on-duty im pairment by alcohol pu rsuant to paragraph (1) fro m safety-s ensitive duties in im plementing subsection (c). (Subsection (c) includes the statutory language cited above [\u00a7104(e)]. These ADA provisions clearly specify that the A DA does not interfere with the com pliance by covered em ployers with DOT regulations concerning drug and alcohol use, including re quirem ents for testing and for removing persons f rom safety-sens itive positions who test pos itive for dru gs or alcoho l. Under the ADA, an em ployer is not viewed as \"discr iminating\" for f ollowing the m andates of DOT drug and alcohol rules. In considering the effects on the personnel ac tions that em ployers choose to take after a safety-sensitive em ployee tests positive for drugs or alcohol or otherwise violates DOT drug or alcohol rules, it is im portant to note that th e ADA's prohibition of e mploym ent discrim ination applies only with respect to a \"qualified individual with a disa bility.\" The ADA specifically provides that an em ployee or applicant who is cu rrently engaging in the illegal use of drugs is not a \"qualified individual with a disability\" (\u00a7104(a)). The ADA does not protect such an employee fr om adverse personnel actions. For pur poses of the ADA, the drugs that trigger this provision are those that the us e, possession, or distribution of which is prohibited by the Controlled Substances A ct (\u00a7101(6)). The five drugs for which DOT m andates tests fit this definition (alcohol is not a drug covere d by the C ontrolled Substances Act). What does \"currently engaging\" in the illega l use of drugs mean? According to the Equal Employm ent Opportunity Comm ission (EEOC), whose rules ca rry out Title I, the term \"currently engaging\" is not intende d to be lim ited to the use of drugs on the day of, or within a matter of days or weeks of, the em ployment acti on in question. Rather, the provision is intended to apply to the illegal u se of drugs th at ha s occurred recen tly enough to ind icate that the individual is actively engaged in such conduct (56 FR 35745-46, July 26, 1991). It is clear that an indiv idual who has a positiv e result on a DOT-m andated drug tes t is cu rrently enga ging in th e illegal use of drugs. Therefore, under Title I, an em ployer may discharge or deny employm ent to an indiv idual who has a positiv e result on a DOT-m andated drug tes t. This provision, that an individual who is currentl y engaging in the illegal use of drugs is not a \"qualified individual with a di sability\" does not apply, of c ourse, if the individual is erroneously regarded as having engaged in the illegal use of drugs. In addition, if an individual, even a former user of illega l drugs, is not c urrently en gaging in the illegal us e of drugs and ( 1) has successf ully com pleted a supervis ed rehabilita tion program or otherwise has been successfully rehabilitated, or (2) is participating in a supe rvised rehabilitation prog ram, the individual can continue to be regarded as a \" qualified individual with a disabilit y,\" if the individual is otherwise entitled to th is sta tus (\u00a71 04(b)). An em ployer may seek reasonabl e assu rance that an individu al is not currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs (i ncluding requiring a drug test) or is in or has com pleted rehabilitation. Som e employers (EEOC uses the exam ple of a law enforcem ent agency) m ay also be able to im pose a job quali fication standard that would exclude som eone with a history of drug abuse if it can show that the standard is job-rela ted and consistent with business necessity (56 F R 35746, July 26, 1991). Appendix C. ADA Discussion C-2 August 2002 Unlike the situation with respect to current use of illegal drugs, the use of alcohol contrary to law, federal regulation, or em ployer policy does not deprive an individu al of status as a \"qualified individual with a disab ility\" that he or she would otherwise have under Title I. An individu al is protec ted b y Title I, ho wever, only if the indiv idual has a d isability in th e first place. (This is also true with respect to a form er drug user or any other individual who seeks the protection of the ADA.) To have a disability, an individual must have a \"physical or m ental impairm ent that subs tantially lim its one or m ore major lif e activitie s of such indiv idual, a re cord of such im pairm ent, or being regarded as having such im pairm ent\" (\u00a71(2)). W hile, as the EEOC notes in I regu lation, \"indiv iduals disabled by alcoho lism are accorded the s ame protections accorded o ther ind ividuals with disabilities\" (56 FR 35752, July 26, 1991), not all individuals who use alcohol in violation of the law, federal regulation, or em ployer policy are \"disabled by alcoholism .\" The courts interpreting section 504 of th e Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (with which ADA employm ent provisions are intended to be consis tent) have concluded th at alcoholism can be a disability which m ay call for reason able accommodation. See e.g., Walker v. Weinb erger, 600 F.Supp. 757 (D.D.C., 1985); Walters, 596 F.Supp. University of Wisconsin, 665 F.Supp. 1372 (W .D. W is., 1987), aff'd 841 f.2d 737 (7th Cir., 1988); Richardson v. Postal Service, 613 F.Supp. 1213 (D.D.C., 1985); and, Sullivan v. City of P ittsburg, 811 F.2d 171 (3rd Cir., 1987). The logic of the ADA and EEOC's regulatory pr ovisions im plem enting the statute, suggest that in determ ining whether an em ployee or applicant who has a positive r esult on a DOT- mandated alcohol test or otherwise violates a DOT alcohol rule is disabled by alcoholism , the employer would answer to questions. First, doe s the individual have a physical or m ental impairment; e.g., is the individua l an alcoholic? (People who te st positive for alcohol are not necessarily an alcoho lic.) This question would probably have to be answered with the assis tance of a physician or substance abuse professional. Second, if the individual is an alcoholic, does this im pairment substantially lim it a m ajor lif e activity or is it (even erroneously) regarded as substantia lly limiting a m ajor lif e activity ? This question would be answ ered on a case-by-case basis, follow ing EEOC's guidelines (see 56 FR 35740-44, July 26, 1991). Under DOT's alcohol prevention rules, it is required that these determ inations be m ade by or in cooperation with the substance abuse professional following a positive test or rule violation. The determ ination of whether an individual is a qualified individual with a disability is m ade in two steps: (1) whether the individual has the appropriate education, experience, skills, and licen ses, and meets the o ther pre requisites of the position ; and (2) whethe r the ind ividual can perform the essential functions of the job de sired or held with or without reasonable accomm odation. Essential functions are th e functi ons that the individu al holding th e position must be able to perform unaided or with reason able accommodation. Several factors are considered in determ ining whether a job functi on is essen tial, includ ing whether the employer actually requires em ployees in the position to pe rform the function, whether the position exists to perform the function, whether th ere are other em ployees who c ould perform the function, and whether there is a high degree of expertise or skill required to perform the function. Appendix C. ADA Discussion C-3 August 2002 If the individual is qualified and determ ined to be disabled by alcoholism, then the em ployer may not discrim inate against the individual on th e basis of his or her disability, and if job perform ance and behavior are not affected by alcoholism , the em ployer must m ake \"reasonable accomm odations\" to the individu al's know n physical o r mental lim itation s, unless the em ployer can dem onstrate that doing so would im pose an \"undue hardship\" on the em ployer's business. The selection of an appropria te \"reasonable accommodation\" is done on a case-by-case basis, as EEOC guidance provides (see 56 FR 35744, July 26, 1991). Reasonable accomm odation for an individual disabled by alc oholism could include su ch actions as referral to an Em ployee Assistance Program or other re habilitation program, pr ovision of rehabil itation services, and giving an employee sufficient tim e to dem onstrate th at rehabilitation has been successful. See, e.g., Washington v. Department of Navy, 30 M.S.P.R. 323 (1986); Swafford v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 18 M.S.P.R. 481 (1983). Even when an individual is disabled by alcohol ism, however, the em ployer is not required to provide a reasonable accomm odation that creates an \"undue hardshi p.\" U ndue hardship involves significan t difficulty or expense in, o r resulting from , providing an accommodation. EEOC describes an undue hardship as \"an accommoda tion that would be unduly costly, extensive, substantial, or disruptive, or that would fundam entally alter th e nature or operation of the business\" (Id). This concept ta kes into account the financial re sources of the em ployer (e.g., an accomm odation that would be reason able for a large business m ay be an undue hardsh ip for a small busine ss). But the concept is n ot limited to financial difficulty. For exam ple, if a sm all truck ing co mpany determ ined that the accomm odation that o ne of its driv ers need ed for an alcoholism -related disab ility was leng thy in-p atient rehab ilitation, company m ight not only find the accomm odation beyond its f inancial resources , but also too disruptive of its operations (i.e., a tem porary replacem ent woul d have to be hired or the work of the firm be reduced significantly). Under Title I, an em ployer m ay hold an em ployee who engages in the illegal use of drugs or who is an alcoholic to the sa me qualification standards for employm ent, job perform ance, and behavior as it holds other em ployees, even if any unsatisfactory perfor mance or behavior is related to the drug use or alcoho lism of the em ployee (\u00a7104(c)(4)). For exam ple, if a s the result of alcoholism, an e mployee is ch ronically late or absent, or makes frequent job errors, the employee would be subject to personnel action on the sam e basis as any other em ployee who exhibited sim ilar behavior for other reasons. (However, if th e alcoholic employee were subjected to personnel actions th at were not used against non -alcoholic employees who were chronically late or absent, or m ade fre quent job errors, then th e alcoholic employee m ight have a cause of action under the ADA.) The employer is not precluded fro m acco mmodating this alcoholic employee, but is not required to do so. It should also be pointed out that the ADA does n ot preclude an em ployer fro m disciplining or dism issing an em comm its a viol ation of the employer's conduct and perform ance standards, even if the individual is an alcohol ic or has another disability. For exam ple, a violation of a DOT operating adm inistration's alc ohol m isuse rules (e.g., a test dem onstrating a prohibited alcohol concentrati on) could be a violation of the em ployer's perform ance and Appendix C. ADA Discussion C-4 August 2002 conduct rules, for which the em ployer's policy co uld call for the em ployee's dism issal. This result would not violate the ADA. There are also situation s in which meeting qu alification standards of DOT safety rules, or having a valid license or certificate from a DO T operating adm inistration is an essential job qualification. If a truck driv er does not m eet FHWA qualif ication standards to obtain a Comm ercial Driver's License from a state, or if a pilot does not qualify for an FAA medical certificate, that ind ividual is no t a \"qualified individual with a disab ility,\" even if the reason for the failure to meet DOT qualif ications is a cond ition that an employer m ight be required to accomm odate under the ADA. The l egislative hist ory of the ADA specifica lly recognizes this special statu s for DOT qualification standard s (see Senate Report 101-116 at 27, August 30, 1989). Another issue that has been raised in context of the relationship between the ADA and alcohol testing concerns whether an alcohol test is a \"m edical exam ination.\" Non-regulatory guidance issued by the E EOC suggests that \"a test to determ ine an individual's blood alcohol level would be a 'm edical exam ination' a nd only could be required by an em ployer in confor mity with the ADA.\" It should be pointed out that this statem ent does not, at face value, apply to breath testing (or other m ethods that do not involve blood sam ples) for alcohol. The EEOC has not determ ined whether it views br eath testing for alcohol as a \"m edical exam ination.\" The Departm ent of Transportation takes the position that alcohol te sting under the program required by these rules is not properly viewed as a required medical exam ination. It is not the collection of a breath or body fluid sam ple that m akes a test \"m edical\" in nature. The tests in question are solely for the pur pose of determ ining whether an employee has violated a DOT- mandated safety requirem ent. The tests are not us ed for any diagnostic or therapeutic purpose. They are not intended to ascerta in whether an employee has any medical condition, and they will not be used for such a purpose. Under th ese circum stances, the policies underlying the ADA provision s on medical ex aminations do not apply . Because o f the uncertainty th at may be created by the EEOC guidance, how ever, it is u seful to consider the im plications of regarding alcohol tests as \"m edical exam inations.\" (The Departm ent is working with the EEOC to resolve this uncertainty.) Even if alcohol tests were considered \"m edical exam inations\" for ADA pu rposes, the effects on com pliance with DOT-m andated alcohol testing would be m inimal. Medical exam inations are perm itted by the ADA if m ade after a conditiona l offer of em ploym ent. The pre-employm ent testing approach set forth in the rules clearly fits this m odel. For this reason, as well as for reasons of efficiency, the Departm ent believes that conducting pre-em ploym ent testing after an offer of e mploym ent, but before the first perfor mance of a safety-sensitive function, has m uch to recomm end it. In addition, EEOC has stated to the Departm ent that, because of the statutory requirem ent in the Om nibus Transportation Em ployee Testing Act of 1991 for pre-em ploym ent testing, EEOC does not object to pr e-offer alcohol testing under the DOT rules m andated by this statute. Other types of testing m andated by thes e rules, such as reas onable suspicion, post- accident, and random testing, are likewise acceptable under ADA. (See 29 CFR 163 0.15(e), which m akes com pliance with the requirem ents of federal law or regulation a defense to an Appendix C. ADA Discussion C-5 August 2002 Appendix C. ADA Discussion C-6 August 2002 allegation of discrimination under Title I of th e ADA.) Congress passed the Omnibus Act more than a year after it passed the ADA, and the form er statute's specific mandates for various types of testing clearly, as a matter of statutory in terpretation, would prevail over any contrary inferences anyone would attempt to draw from the more general provisions of the latter. A related issue concerns the confidentiality of the records of alcohol tests. To the extent that an alcohol test is regarded as a medical examination, the records of the test would be \"treated as a confidential medical record\" under the ADA (see \u00a7102(c)(3)(B) of the ADA). Under this provision, records of a medical exam ination are required to be kept in a separate medical file. The purpose of any requirements for confidentiality of a medical record is to safeguard the employee's right of privacy with respect to pers onal medical information. An employee may, of course, waive such a right. (As a general matter, medical confidentiality provisions allow a patient to permit medical information to be pr ovided to third parties.) The DOT rules, by requiring the employee to consent in writing, to th e provision of test records to subsequent employers or third parties, are fully consiste nt with normal medical confidentiality waiver practices and with the ADA. It would clea rly be anomalous to vi ew a medical records confidentiality provision as prohibiting an empl oyee from voluntarily agreeing that a previous employer or physician could send a medical r ecord to a current em ployer or physician.

Laboratories certified through that program were accredited to conduct forensic urine drug testing as required by U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations. As of that date, the certification of those accredited Canadian laboratories will continue under DOT authority. The responsibility for conducting quarterly performance testing pl us periodic on-site inspections of those LAPSA-accredited laboratories was transferred to the U.S. DHHS, with the DHHS' National Laboratory Certification Program (NLCP) contractor cont inuing to have an active role in the performance testing and laboratory inspection processes. Other Canadian laboratories wishing to be considered for the NLCP may apply directly to the NLCP contractor just as U.S. laboratories do. Upon finding a Canadian laboratory to be qualified, the DHHS will recommend that DOT certify the laboratory (Federal Register, 16 July 1996) as meeting the minimum standards of the \"Mandatory Guidelines for Workplace Drug Testing\" (59 Federal Register, 9 June 1994, Pages 29908-29931). After receiving the DOT certification, the laboratory will be included in the monthly list of DHHS certified laboratories and participate in the NLCP certification maintenance program. Appendix E Conforming Products List of Evidential Breath Measurement Devices Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 141 / Friday, July 21, 2000 / Notices 45419 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [Docket No. NHTSA-00-7570] Highway Safety Programs; Model Specifications for Devices To Measure Breath Alcohol AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice amends the Conforming Products List for instruments that conform to the Model Specifications for Evidential Breath Testing Devices (58 FR 48705). EFFECTIVE DATE: July 21, 2000. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. James F. Frank, Office of Traffic Injury Control Programs, Impaired Driving Division (NTS-11), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, D.C. 20590; Telephone: (202) 366-5593. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : On November 5, 1973, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published the Standards for Devices to Measure Breath Alcohol (38 FR 30459). A Qualified Products List of Evidential Breath Measurement Devices comprised of instruments that met this standard was first issued on November 21, 1974 (39 FR 41399). On December 14, 1984 (49 FR 48854), NHTSA converted this standard to Model Specifications for Evidential Breath Testing Devices, and published a conforming Products List (CPL) of instruments that were found to conform to the Model Specifications as Appendix D to that notice (49 FR 48864). On September 17, 1993, NHTSA published a notice (58 FR 48705) to amend the Model Specifications. The notice changed the alcohol concentration levels at which instruments are evaluated, from 0.000, a test for the presence of acetone; and expanded the definition of alcohol to include other low molecular weight alcohols including methyl or isopropyl. On June 4, 1999, the most recent amendment to the Conforming Products List (CPL) was published (64 FR 30097), identifying those instruments found to conform with the Model Specifications. Since the last publication of the CPL, two (2) instruments have been evaluated and found to meet the model specifications, as amended on September 17, 1993, for mobile and 45420 Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 141 / Friday, July 21, 2000 / Notices non-mobile use. They are: (1) Intoxilyzer 400PA manufactured by CMI, Inc. of Owensboro, KY. This device is a hand-held breath tester with a fuel cell alcohol sensor. (2) Alco Sensor IV-XL manufactured by Intoximeters, Inc. of St. Louis, MO. This device is a hand-held breath tester with a fuel cell alcohol sensor that is microprocessor controlled. It is designed to minimize operator involvement in performing the test and processing the test data. The CPL has been amended to add these two instruments to the list. In accordance with the foregoing, the CPL is therefore amended, as set forth below.

Fact Sheets Drug Detection Period s Detection periods vary; rates of m etabolism and excretion are different for each dru g and use. Detection periods shou ld be viewed as estim ates. Cases can always be found to contradict these approxim ations. Drug Detection Period Amphetamines Am pheta Cannabinoids (Marijuana) Casual Use Chronic Use 2-7 days Up to 30 days Ethanol (Alcohol) 12-24 Phencyclidine (PCP) Casual Use Chronic Use 2-7 days Up to 30 days Appendix F. Fact Sheets August 2002 F-1Alcohol Fact Sheet Alcohol is a socially accept able drug that has been consum ed throughout the world for centuries. It is consid ered a recreational beverage when consum ed in m oderation for enjoym ent and relaxation during social gatherings. However, when consum ed prim arily for its physical and mood-altering effects, it is a substance of abuse. As a de pressant, it slow s down physical responses and progressively impairs m ental functions. Signs and Symptoms o f Use Dulled m ental processes Lack of coordination Odor of alcohol on breath Possible constricted pupils Sleepy or s tuporous con dition Slowed reaction rate Slurred sp eech (Note: Except for the odor, th ese are general sign s and sym ptoms of any depressant substance.) Health Effe cts The chronic consum ption of alc ohol (average of three servings per day of beer [12 ounces], whiskey [1 ounce], or wine [6 ounce glass]) over time may result in the fo llowing health hazards: Decreased sexual functioning Dependency (up to 10 percent of all people w ho drink alcohol becom e physically and/or mentally dependent on alcohol a nd can be term ed \"alcoholic\") Fatal live r diseases Increased cancers of the mouth, tongue, pharynx, esophagus, rectum , breast, and malignant melanom a Kidney disease Pancrea titis Spontaneous abortion and neonatal mortality Ulcers Birth defects (up to 54 percent of a ll birth defects are alcohol related) Appendix F. Fact Sheets August 2002 F-2Social Issues Two-thirds of all hom icides are comm itted by people who drink prior to the crim e. Two to three percent of the driv ing population is legally drunk at any one tim e. This rate is doubled at night and on weekends. Two-thirds of all Am ericans will be invol ved in an alcoho l-related vehicle accid ent during th eir lif etimes. The rate of s eparation an d divorce in fa milies with alcohol d ependency problem s is 7 times the av erage. Forty percent of fa mily court cas es are alcohol problem related. Alcoholics are 15 tim es more likely to comm it suicide than are other segments of the population. More than 60 percent of burns, 40 percent of falls, 69 percent of boating accidents, and 76 percent of private aircraft accidents are alcohol related. The Annual Toll 24,000 people will die on the nation's highway s due to the legally im paired driver. 12,000 m ore will die on the nation 's highways due to the alco hol-affected driver. 15,800 will die in non -highway accid ents. 30,000 will die due to alcohol -caused liver disease. 10,000 will die due to alcohol-induced brain d isease or su icide. Up to anoth er 125,000 will die due to alc ohol-related conditions or accid ents. Workplace Issues It takes one hour for the average person (150 pounds) to process one serving of an alcoholic beverage from the body. Impairment in coordination and judgm ent can be objectively m easured with as little as two drinks in the body. A person who is legally intoxicated is 6 tim es more likely to have an accident than a sober person. Appendix F. Fact Sheets August 2002 F-3Amphetamine Fact Sheet Ampheta mines are central nervous system stim ulants that speed up the m ind and body. The physical sense of energy at lower doses and th e mental exhilaration at higher doses are the reasons for their abuse. Although widely prescr ibed at one tim e for weight reduction and m ood elevation, the legal use of a mpheta mines is now limited to a very narrow range of m edical conditions. Most am phetam ines that are abused are illegally m anufactured in foreign countries and sm uggled into the U.S. or clandestin ely m anufactured in crude laboratories. Description Ampheta mine is sold in counterfeit capsul es or as white, flat, double-scored \"m ini- bennies.\" is us ually taken by m outh. Metham phetam ine is often sold as a cream y wh ite and granular powder or in lum ps, and is packag ed in alum inum foil wraps o r sealable plastic bags. Metham phetam ine m ay be taken orally, injected, or snorted into the nose. Trade/street nam es include lcobese, Desotyn, Detedrine, Chetrol, Ritalin, Speed, Meth, Crank, Crystal, Monster, Black Beauties, and Rits. Signs and Symptoms o f Use Hyperexcitability, restlessness Dilated pup ils Increased heart rate and blood pressure Heart palpitations and irregular beats Profuse sweating Rapid respiration Confusion Panic Talkativenes s Inability to c oncentr ate Heightened aggressive behavior Health Effe cts Regular use produces strong ps ychological dependence and in creasing tolerance to the drug. High doses m ay cause toxic psycho sis resem bling schizophrenia. Intoxication m ay induce a heart attack or stroke due to spiking of blood pressure. Chronic use m ay cause heart and bra in dam age due to seve re constriction o f capilla ry blood vessels. Appendix Fact Sheets August 2002 The euphoric stim ulation increases impulsive and risk-taking behavi ors, including bizarre and violent acts. Withdrawal from the drug m ay result in severe physical and mental depression. Workplace Issues Since am phetam ines alleviate the s ensation of fatigue, they m ay be abus ed to increase alertness because of unusual overtim e dem ands or failure to get rest. Low-dose amphetam ine use will cau se a shor t-term improvem ent in m ental and phy sical functioning. W ith greater use or increasing fatigue, the effect reverses and has an impairing effect. Hangover effect is char acterized by physical fatigue and depression, which m ay make operation of equi pment or vehicles dangerous. Appendix F. Fact Sheets August 2002 F-5Cocaine Fact Sheet Cocaine is used m edically as a local anesthe tic. It is abused as a powerful physical and mental stimulant. The entire central nervous syst em is energized. Muscles are m ore tense, the heart beats f aster and stronger, and the body bur ns m ore energy. The brain experiences an exhilaration caused by a large release of neurohormones asso ciated with mood elevation. Description The source of cocaine is the coca bush, gr own almost exclusivel y in the mountainous regions of northern South Am erica. Cocaine Hydrochloride - \"snorti ng coke\" is a white to crea my granular or lum py powder that is chopped into a fine powder before use. It is snorted into the nose, rubbed on the gums, or injected in veins. The effect is felt within m inutes an d lasts 40 to 50 m inutes per \"line\" (about 60 to 9 0 milligrams). Co mmon paraphernalia includ e a single-edged razor b lade and a sm all m irror or piece of sm ooth metal, a half straw or m etal tube, and a small screw cap vial or folded pa per packet con taining th e cocaine. Cocaine Base - a sm all crystalline rock about th e size of a small pebble. It boils at a low temperature, is not soluble in water, and is up to 90 percent pure. It is heated in a glass pipe and the vapor is inhaled. The ef fect is felt w ithin 7 seconds. Comm on paraphernalia includes a \"crack p ipe\" (a sm all glas s smoking device for vaporizing the crack crystal) and a lighter, alcohol lamp, or small butane torch for heating. Trade/street nam es include Coke, Rock, Crack, Free Base, Flake, Snow, Sm oke, and Blow. Signs and Symptoms o f Use Financial problem s Frequent and extended absences from meetings or work assignm ent Increased physical activity and fatigue Isolation and withdrawal from friends and norm al activities Secretive behaviors, frequent nonbusiness vi sitors, delivered packages, phone calls Unusual defensiveness, anxiety, agitation Wide mood swings Runny or irritated nose Difficulty in concentration Dilated pupils and visual im pairment Restlessn ess Form ication (sensation of bugs crawling on skin) High blood pressure, heart palpit ations, and irregular F. Fact Sheets August 2002 F-6 Paranoia Profuse sweating and dry m outh Talkativenes s Health Effe cts Research su ggests th at regular cocaine use m ay upset th e chemical ba lance of the brain. As a result, it m ay speed up the aging proce ss by causing irreparable damage to critical nerve cells. The onset of nervous sys tem illne sses such as Parkinson' s disease cou ld also occur. Cocaine use causes the heart to beat fast er and harder and rapidly increases blood pressure. In addition, cocaine causes spasm s of blood vessels in the brain and heart. Both effects lead to ruptu red vessels causing strokes or heart attacks. Strong psychological dependency can occur with one \"hit\" of crack. Usually, m ental dependency occurs within days (crack) or within severa l months (snorting coke). Cocaine causes the strongest m ental dependency of any known drug. Treatm ent success rates are lower th an for other chem ical dependencies. Cocaine is extrem ely dangerous when take n with depressant drugs. Death due to overdose is rapid. The fatal effects of an overdose are not usually reversible by m edical intervention. The num ber of cocaine overdose deaths has tripled in the last 4 years. Cocaine overdose was the second m ost comm on drug em ergency in 1986 - up from 11th place in 198 0. Workplace Issues Extrem e mood and energy swings create instab ility. Sudden noises can cause a violent reaction. Lapses in attention and ignoring warning si gnals greatly increase the potential for acciden ts. The high co st of cocaine frequently l eads to work place theft and/or dealin g. A developing paranoia and withdraw al create unpredictable and som etimes violent behavior. Work perform ance is characterized August 2002 F-7Cannabinoids (Marijuana) Fact Sheet Marijuana is one of the most m isunderstood an d underestim ated drugs of abuse. People use marijuana for the ildly tranqu ilizing and m ood- and percepti on-altering effects it produces. Description Usually sold in plas tic sa ndwich bags , leaf marijuana will ran ge in colo r from green to light tan. T he leaves are usually dry and br oken into sm all pieces. The seeds are ov al with one slightly pointed end. Less prevalen t, hashish is a com pressed, som etimes tarlike substance ranging in color from pale yellow to black. It is usually sold in sm all chunks wrapped in alum inum foil. It m ay also be sold in any oily liquid. Marijuana has a distinctly pungent arom a rese mbling a com bination of sweet alfalfa and incense. Cigarette papers, roach clip holders, and sm all pipes m ade of bone, brass, or glass are commonly used. Sm oking \"bongs\" (large bore pipes for inhaling large volum es of smoke) can easily be m ade from soft drink cans and toilet paper rolls. Trade/s treet nam es include Ma rinol, THC, Pot, Grass, Jo int, Reefer, Acapulco Gold, Sinsem illa, Thai Stick s, Hash, and Hash Oil. Signs and Symptoms o f Use Reddened eyes (often masked by eyedrops) Slowed speech Distinctive odor on clothing Lackadais ical \"I don 't care\" attitude Chronic fatigue and lack of m otivation Irritating cough, chronic sore throat Health Effe cts General When m arijuana is sm oked, it is irritati ng to the lungs. Chronic sm oking causes emphyse ma-like conditions. One joint causes the heart to race an d be overworked. People with undiagnosed heart conditions are at risk. Marijuana is commonly cont aminated with the fungus Asperg illus, which can cause serious respiratory tract and sinus infections. Marijuana smoking lowers the body's imm une s ystem response, m aking users m ore susceptible to infection. The U.S. gove rnment is actively re searching a possible Appendix F. Fact Sheets August 2002 F-8connection between m arijuana sm oking and th e activ ation o f AIDS in positiv e human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV) carriers. Pregnancy P roblem s and Birth Defects The active chem ical, tetrahydrocannabinol (T HC), and 60 other related chem icals in marijuana concentrate in the ovaries and tes tes. Chronic smoking of m arijuana in m ales causes a decrease in sex horm one, testosterone, and an increase in estrogen, the fem ale sex horm one. The result is a decrease in sperm count, which can lead to tem porary sterility. Occasionally, the onset of fem ale sex characteristics including breast developm ent occurs in heavy users. Chronic smoking of m arijuana in females causes a decrease in fe rtility and an increase in testosterone. Pregnant wom en who are chronic mariju ana sm okers have a higher than norm al incidence of stillborn births, early term ination of pregnancy, and hi gher infant m ortality rate during the first few days of life. In tes t anim als, THC causes birth defects, including m alformations of the brain, spinal cord, forelimbs, and liver and water on the brain and spine. Offspring of test anim als who were exposed to marijuana have fewer chromosom es than norm al, causing gross birth defects or death of the fetus. Pediatrician s and surgeons are concluding that the use of m arijuana by e ither or both parents, especially during pregnancy, leads to specific birth def ects of the infant's feet and hands. One of the most common effects of pren atal cannabinoid expos ure is underweight newborn babies. Fetal exposure m ay decrease visual f unctio ning and causes other ophthalm ic problems. Mental Function Regular use can cause th e following effects: Delayed decision-m aking Diminished concentratio n Impaired ering learning Impaired sig nal detectio n (ability to detec t a brief flash of light), a r isk for users who are operating machinery Impaired tracking (the ability to follow a moving object with the eyes) and visual distan ce m easurem ents Appendix F-9 Erratic cogn itive functio n Distortions in tim e estimation Long-term negativ e effects on m ental function kn own as \"acu te brain syn drome,\" whi ch is characterized by disorders in m emory, c ognitive function, sleep pa tterns, and physical conditions Acute Effects Aggressive urges Anxiety Confusion Fearfulness Hallucin ations Heavy sedation Immobility Mental dependency Panic Paranoid reaction Unpleasant distortions in body im age Workplace Issues The active chem ical, THC stores in body fat and slowly releases over tim e. Marijuana smoking has a long-term effect on perform ance. A 500 to 800 percent increase in THC concentr ation in the past several years m akes smoking three to five joints a week today e quivalent to 15 to 40 joints a week in 1978. Com bining alcohol o r other depressant dr ugs and marijuana can produce a m ultiplied effect, increasing th e impairing effect of both the depressant and m arijuana. Appendix F. Fact Sheets August 2002 F-10Opiates (Narcotics) Fact Sheet Opiates (also called narcotics) are drugs th at alleviate pain, de press body functions and reactions, and when taken in large doses, cause a strong euphoric feeling. Description Natural and natural derivatives - opi um, m orphine, codeine, and heroin. Synthetics - m orphone (Num orphan), and oxycodone (Percodan) May be taken in pill form, s moked, or inject ed, depending upon the type of narcotic used. Trade/street nam es include Sm ack, Horse, Emma, Big D, Dollies, Juice, Syrup, and China W hite. Signs and Symptoms o f Use Mood changes Impaired m ental functioning and alertness Constric ted pupils Depression and apathy Impaired coordination Physical fatigue and drowsiness Nausea, vom iting, and constipation Impaired res piration Health Effe cts IV needle users have a high risk for contrac ting hepatitis and AIDS due to the sharing of needles. Narcotics in creas e pain toleran ce. As a result, people could mo re severe ly inju re them selves or fail to seek m edical attention after an accid ent due to the lack of pain sensitivity. Narcotics' e ffects are multip lied wh en used in c ombination with othe r depressan t drugs and alcoho l, causing increased risk for an overdose. Social Issues There are over 500,000 heroin addicts in the Un ited States m ost of whom are IV needle users. An even greater num ber of m edicinal narcot ic-dependent persons obtain their narcotics through prescriptions. Appendix F. Fact Sheets August 2002 F-11 Because of toleran ce, there is an ever-incr easing need for m ore narcotics to produce the same effect. Strong m ental and physical dependency occurs. The com bination of tolerance and dependency creates an increasing finan cial bu rden for the user. Costs for heroin can reach hundreds of dollars a day. Workplace Issues Unwanted side effects such as nausea, vom iting, dizziness, m ental clouding, and drowsiness place the leg itimate user and a buser a t highe r risk for an accid ent. Narcotics ha ve a leg itimate m edical use in alleviating pa in. W orkplace use m ay cause impairment of physical and m ental functions. Appendix F. Fact Sheets August 2002 F-12Phencycli dine (PCP) Fact Sheet Phencyclidine (PCP) was originally developed as an anesth etic, but th e adverse s ide effects prevented its use except as a larg e anim al tranquilizer. Phencyclid ine acts as both a depressant and a hallucinogen, and som etimes as a stim ulant. It is abused prim arily for its variety of m ood- altering effects. Low doses produce sedati on and euphoric m ood changes. The m ood can change rapidly from sedation to excitation and agitation. Larger doses may produce a com a-like condition with m uscle rigidity and a blank stare with the eyelids half cl osed. Sudden noises or physical chocks m ay cause a \"freak out\" in which the person has abnorm al strength, extrem ely violen t beha vior, and an inability to s peak or com prehend co mmunicatio n. Description PCP is sold as a cream y, granular powder and is often packaged in one-inch square alum inum foil or folded paper \"packets.\" It may be m ixed with m arijuana or to bacco and s moked. It is som etimes com bined with procain e, a local anesthetic, and sold as im itation cocaine. Trade/street nam es include Angel Dust, Dust, and Hog. Signs and Symptoms o f Use Impaired coordination Severe conf usion and agitation Extrem e mood shif eye movem ents) Dilated pup ils Profuse sweating Rapid heartbeat Dizziness Health Effe cts The potential for accid ents and overd ose em ergencies is high due to the extrem e mental effects combined with the anesthetic effect on the body. PCP is potentiated by other depressant drugs, including alcohol, increasing the likelihood of an overdose reaction. Misdiagnosing the hallucinations as LSD indu ced, and then treating with Thorazine, can cause a fatal reaction. Use can cau se irreversib le memory loss, personality changes, and thought disorders. Appendix F. Fact Sheets August 2002 F-13Appendix F. Fact Sheets August 2002 F-14 There are four phases to PCP abuse. The first phase is acute toxicity. It can last up to 3 days and can include combativeness, catatoni a, convulsions, and coma . Distortions of size, shape, and distance perception are common. The second phase, which does not always follow the first, is a toxic psychosis. Users may experience visual and auditory delusions, paranoia, and agitation. The third phase is a drug-induced schizophrenia that may last a month or longer. The fourth phase is PCP-induced depression. Suicidal tendencies and mental dysfunc tion can last for months. Workplace Issues PCP abuse is less common today than in recent y ears. It is also not generally used in a workplace setting because of the se vere disorientation that occurs. Appendix G Questions and AnswersAppendix G. Questions and Answ ers GENERAL ISSUES Q. Under w hat authority d id FTA create this rule? A. The Om nibus Transportation Em ployee Testing Act of 1991 has given FT A the necessary statu tory au thority to req uire its g rantees to im plem ent both drug and alcohol testing program s. This act also gives th e FTA specific statutory authority to pre-em pt inconsistent State or local laws with regard to drug and alcohol testing. Q. How will the Federal T ransit Adm inistra tion ensure com pliance w ith the regula tions? A. Recipients of Federal funds m ust certify a nnually that they are in com pliance with these regulations. False certification is a violation of federal law. Each recipien t must com plete annual reports summ arizing the results of its drug and alcohol testing program s, and upon request, subm it the m to FTA. A full review and evaluation of the perform ance of gr ant recipients is conducted every 3 years under FTA's Triennial Review process. In addition, the FTA conducts drug and alcohol oversight com pliance audits on a random basis. All f our processes will be used to determ ine com pliance. Q. Who w ill re gulate emp loyees subje ct to the ju risdict ion not only of the FTA but also of other modes as w ell? A. The FTA ha s resolv ed ju risdictional issues with other m odes having concurrent jurisdiction over tr ansit em ployees. In gener al, the FTA rule will app ly to saf ety-sen sitive em ployees of its grantees, except for ferryboa t operators covered under the U.S. Coast Guard. The details of this deferral m echanis m are spelled out in the FTA rule. Q. What are the consequences if employers do not comply w ith the FTA drug and alcohol regulations? A. Com pliance with these regulat ions is a condition of FTA fund ing. Failure to im plement drug and alcohol program s pursuant to the regulations may result in suspension or term ination of FTA funding. Q. Contract employees a re deemed to \"stand in the shoes\" o f covered employees. How does this impact the user-side subsidy pr ograms? Are taxi drivers, dispatchers, and mechanics subject to the FTA rule? Would a ll taxi drivers in a firm be subject to testing even if only a small part of their business involved a user-side subsidy supported through an FTA progr am? A. To the extent that a taxi com pany does not provide service under an arrangem ent with an FTA recipient, but is chosen by a passenger, it w ould not be subject to the rule. If, however, the taxicab com pany or private operator provide s service under an arra ngem ent with an FTA Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-1 August 2002 recipient, and som eone other than the passenger chooses the provider (i.e . broker, dispatcher) it is covered by the rule as a contractor, as de fined by the rule. In such cases, the taxi company may wish to designate only certain driv ers to provide such services, in which case only those designated drivers would be subjec t to the ru le. Ta xi opera tors that a re independent contractors for a ta xi company that is under contr act to an F TA recipient. Operators m ust ensure th e com pliance of m aintenance providers that \"s tand in the shoes\" for the operator. Section 5311, 5307, and 5309 system s, with service populations less than 200,000, are exem pt from the m aintenance requirem ent. Q. What is FTA's definition of an accident? A. FTA has defined \"accident\" to distinguish am ong different kinds of mass trans it veh icles. The definition states that an accident occurs when a road veh icle (whether a m ass tran sit vehicle or another vehicle, su ch as a private auto mobile) su ffers disabling dam age and is towed away from the scene of the accident. In addition, if other types of vehicles (e.g., rail, vessel) are rem oved from revenue s ervice as th e result of the occurrence, an \"acciden t\" is deem ed to take place. Q. If a passenger has a heart attack on a tr ansit vehicle an d dies, is a post-accident test required? A. No, the fatality was not associated with the operation of the vehicle. Q. How does the FTA det ermine w ho is covered by this rule? A. The FTA de termined that job function rather than job title wa s critic al to transit saf ety because each trans it sys tem uses its own job classification categories. FT A concluded that five job functions were critical to saf ety - operating, m aintaining, and controlling the move ment of a revenue service vehicle, m aintaining revenue service equipm ent, security personnel w ho carry firearm s, and holders of CDLs who operate nonrevenue service vehicles. However, the em ployer must ultim ately determ ine the job c ategories that d irectly impact the safe operation of revenue service vehicles. Q. Are supervisors also co vered by this rule? A. Supervisors are included only if they perform one of the fi ve designated safety-sensitive functions. Q. Are volunteers included under this rule? A. No, unless the volunteer receives remuneration in excess of their actual expenses or the volunteer is required to have a CDL to operate the em ployer's vehicles. Q. If a trans it operator ha s contract employees that perfor m safety -sensitive func tions, do they have to be tested? Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-2 August 2002 A. Yes, except contract m echanics who perfor m work for system that serve populations of 200,000 or less, this includes Section 5311, 5307, and 5309 recipients. Q. Transferees are included under pre-employment testing. When do you test a transfer employee? A. When an e mployee transfers from a non-safe ty-sensitive position to a safety-sensitive position, he must be tes ted prior to the firs t time he perform s a safety-s ensitive function. Q. Must a supervisor use personal obser vations as a determinant for a reasonable suspicion referra l? A. Yes, the sup erviso r's de termination must be m ade based on specific, contem poraneous, articulable observations con cerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odor of the employee. All these determ inants are short-term indicators of prohibited drug use or alcohol misuse. He nce, long-term indicators such as absenteeism may not be used as a basis for a reasonable suspicion determ ination. Hearsay or observations m ade by others m ay not be a determ inate unless verified by the supe rviso r's direct p ersonal observations. Q. After an accident, w hat is the emp loyer' s immediate responsibility u nder the rule? A. After a fatal acciden t, the em ployer must tes t the safety-sens itive em ployee (operator) o n duty in th e vehicle at the tim e of the acciden t. Then the em ployer m ust determ ine whether to test other safety-sensitive em ployees who m ay have contributed to th e accident. After a nonfatal accident, the employer m ust determ ine whether to test safety -sensitiv e em ployees on duty in th e vehicle at the tim e of the acciden t or who m ay have contributed to the accident. In both fatal and nonfatal accidents, the em ployer must test the em ployee as soon as possible, following an acciden t, but no later than 8 hours for alcoho l and 32 hours for drugs. Q. Can an employee leav e the scene of an acci dent before taking a drug or alcohol test? A. An e mployee m ay leave the scen e of an accid ent, without bein g tested, as long as he rem ains readily available for testing. That m eans that the supervisor must know the whereabouts of the em ployee until he is tested and that the em ployee is av ailable to be tested imm ediately after being notified by the em ploye r (within 32 hours of the accide nt for drug testing and/or 8 hours for alcohol testing). Q. Does the rule apply to Indian tribal governmen ts? A. Yes. As a general m atter, statutes apply to Indian nations or trib es unless: (1) the law touches exclusive rights of self -governance in purely intram ural matters; (2) the application of the law would abrogate rights guaranteed by Indian treaties; or (3) there is proof by legislative history or som e other m eans that Congress intended the law not to apply to Indians on their reservations. In this regard, there is no legislative history indicating congressional intent not to appl y the act to Indian tribes. FT A concludes that the act w ould preem pt Indian law. Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-3 August 2002 Q. Can transit operators receive w aivers from the requirement of thes e rule? A. No. The Omnibus Transportation E mployee Tes ting Act does not give the FTA authority to \"waive\" any particular requirem ent of this rule. Q. Which DOT rule applies to Sectio n 5310 recipients, FTA, or FMCSA? A. Employees of Section 5310 recipients are not covered by FTA's rule, but are covered by FMCSA if t he driver of the vehi cle is required to have a CDL. Q. Light rail systems that share tracks w ith the general ra ilroad systems are covered by the FRA. Whose rule applies if an empl oyer has employees covered by more th an one DOT modal administra tion? A. If a recip ient operates a railroad as w ell as other mass transit servic es, its railroad operations are subject to FRA's rule, while its nonrailroa d mass transit operato rs are subjec t to the FTA rule. Q. What about employers who operate ferry v essels that a re regulated b y the United States Coast Guard (U SCG)? A. FTA has determ ined that ferry operations that receive federal transit funds and com ply with the USCG chem ical testing and alcoh ol testing requirem ents at 46 CFR parts 4 and 16, and 33 CFR part 95 will be in concurr ent com pliance with the con trolled subs tance te sting requirem ents of 49 CFR part 655. The ferry operato rs will also be in concurrent com pliance with m ost of FTA' s alcohol testing requirem ents; however, they are requir ed to continue to comply with FTA' s random alcohol testi ng requirem ents under 49 CFR part 655.45 because random alcohol testing is a st atutory requirem ent for FTA reci pients, and the USCG does not have a substantially sim ilar provision. RANDOM RAT ES Q. What is the random testing rate for drugs and ho w is it determined? A. The random drug testing rate is set at 50 percent. However, the rate m ay be lowered to 25 percent if the violati on rate is less than 1.0 percent pe r year for 2 consecutive years. Q. What is the random tes ting rate fo r alcohol an d how is it determined? A. The rule requires em ployers to random ly test for alcohol at 25 percen t. However, the rate may be lowe red to 10 percent if the violation rate is less than 0.5 percent per year for 2 consecutive years. It m ay also be increased to 50 percent, if th e violation rate is equal to or greater th an 1 percen t for one year . FTA will publish a no tice in the Federal Register annually announcing its random alcohol testing rate based on the data collected from the Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-4 August 2002 transit industry. The rate is calculated and im plem ented indus try-wide, and not on the basis of any individual em ployer's rate. TESTI NG PROCEDURES Q. If an ap plicant tests positive, do I have to refer him/her to a SAP? A. Yes, You m ust provide the ap plicant with a list of SAPs. Once the list is provided, you have fulfilled you r oblig ation. Q. If the employee receiv es a verified positive drug test result or a brea th alcohol test result o f 0.04 or greater, is the employee subject to referra l to a SAP and/or rehabilitation? A. Yes, he or s he must be referred to th e SAP. If the em ployer has a \"secon d chance\" p olicy, the em ployee m ust com plete the return-to- duty process, including SAP recommended education or treatment prior to b eing reass igned to saf ety-sen sitive duty. Paym ent for the education/treatm ent is a local policy decision. Q. Will it be p ossible for a n agency to belong to one consortium for alco hol test ing and a second consortium for drug testing? A. Yes. This decis ion rem ains with the trans it operator. It m ay be based on any negotiated labor-m anagem ent agreem ent, and the operator's budgetary conditions. Q. Is an emplo yer required to keep a n SAP on retainer o r can the employer refer a n employee to a list of SAPs, but have no formal connection w ith the SAPs? A. The relationship an em ployer has with the SA P is left up to the em ployer. Evaluation and rehabilitation m ay be provided by the em ploye r, (e.g., an EAP program ), by an SAP under contract with the em ployer, or by a SAP not affi liated with the em ployer. The only requir ement is tha t the S APs listed m et the m inimum requirem ents specified in the regula tions. The choice a nd assignm ent of costs will b e dete rmined by labo r/managem ent agreem ents and the com pany's policies. Q. The rule mandates a minimum o f six (6) foll ow-up tests in the fir st 12 months follow ing an employee's return to duty. Can these foll ow-up tests be counted tow ard the number needed for random tes ting? A. No, follow-up testing cannot be counted toward the num ber needed for random testing. Q. The rule specifies a minimum of s ix (6) fo llow-up tests in 12 months after an employee returns to d uty. Are employees w ho return to duty also returned to the general random testing pool? A. Yes. The employee is returned to the random pool upon returning to duty. Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-5 August 2002 Q. If an emplo yee changed jobs prior to the completion of th e SAP recommended follow - up testing p lan, w hat testing w ould be re quired of the new employer - just a pre- employmen t test or a continuation of the follow -up test? A. The new employer would require a pre-em ploym ent test and would have to continue the follow-up testing. Q. If an employer conducts road tests on applic ants prior to hire, do they have to have a drug test be fore the roa d test is giv en, even though they have not been hired? A. Yes, operation of a revenue se rvice vehic le is consider ed a saf ety-sensitive function even if the vehicle is not in revenue service. Q. The rule requires referral to a SAP. If any employer's policy is to fire all emplo yees who receive verified positive d rug test results or tests for alcoho l at 0.04 or a bove, what is the p urpose of th e SAP? Must an emplo yer refer prior to dis missal? A. Any e mployee who is covered by FTA's drug and alcohol regulations and has a verified positiv e dru g test o r alcohol tes t result of 0.04 or greater m ust be referred to an SAP. This does not preclude th e employer from applyi ng ad dition al con sequences, e.g., imm ediate dism issal, to the affected em ployee. Howe ver, it must be clearly understood that the employer is doing so under its own com pany po licy, and not any federal authority. F or the employee to be able to return-to-duty for a nother DOT covered em ployer, the em ployee m ust be able to sh ow that they fulfilled a S AP's treatment re commendation an d met the re turn-to - duty requirem ents of 49 CFR Part 40. Q. Can an employer conduct both a drug test and alcohol test under the return-to-duty provision? A. An e mployer m ay, based on the recommendati ons of the SAP, subject an em ployee who previous ly had a verified positiv e dru g test resu lt to a return -to-duty alco hol test. In addition, an em ployer m ay, based on the recommendations of the SAP, subject an em ployee who previously had an alcohol test result at or greater than 0.04 to a return-to-duty test for prohibited drugs. Q. Can a traffic cita tion b e used as a reason for a post-acc ident test? A. No. Traffic citations are not included as part of the post-accide nt testing criteria established by FTA. Q. If an emplo yee is required to submit to foll ow-up testing for a positive drug test, can he or she be required to also submit to follow -up testing for alcohol also? A. If the SAP thinks it is ap propriate, then the em ployer m ay test for drugs and alcohol on follow-up. Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-6 August 2002 Q. After being notified by a Medical Review Officer (MRO) if a verified positive dr ug test, an employee has 72 hours to requ est that the split sa mple be tested . When does the 72- hour period begin and end? A. The 72 hours begin when the em ployee has been notified by the MRO. The 72-hour tim e period includes both holidays and w eekends. TRAI NING Q. Why are you requiring training for mass transit employees on drug use but not on alcohol misuse? A. Among m any em ployees, inform ation about drugs - what they are, what their effects are, what legal consequences for their use are - is less likely to be a m atter of comm on knowledge than inform ation about alcohol and it s misuse. Training is m ore useful when it fills what m ay be an inf ormation gap. Q. Employees are to be provided w ith material s on the drug and alcohol testing policies and procedures. What materials should be provided to contract employees? Do they get the ma terials fro m the FTA recipient o r from their ow n firm? W hat if the p olicies of the opera tor differ from th e subcontractor (i.e., the recip ient provides rehabilitation for its safe ty-sensitive employ ees, but the subcontracto r fires all driv ers w ho fail a drug test)? Whic h policies will pr evail? A. The FTA drug and alcohol rule requires an employer to m ake available to every safety- sensitive em ployee, a policy statem ent describi ng the em ployer's prohibited drug and alcohol misuse program s. The rule does not preclude the em ployer from having sanctions under its own authority in addition to those m andated by FTA, but it must be clearly defined as separate from FTA's requirem ents. Likewise, th e rule does not precl ude the recipient from stipulating consequences as part of its c ontractual relationship w ith the subcontractor. Q. The rule specifies a certain number of hours of train ing for employees and supervisors. Are these h ours of tra ining a one-time requi rement or are they period ic? What would happen if a supervisor changed jobs? Would additional training hours be required? A. The training requirem ents in the rule ar e one-tim e requirem ents. W hile it could be considered \"best practice\" to provide refreshe r training, the rule does not elaborate on this issue, and a ddition al training is lef t to the dis cretion of the e mployers. I f a superviso r becom es responsible for m aking reasonable susp icion referrals, that sup ervisor m ust receive additional training. If a supervisor cha nged em ployers, the new FTA-covered em ployer would be required to provide training for the su pervisor. The fa ct that the supervisor had training at the previous employer is not relevant. Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-7 August 2002 Q. How much training are employers re quired to provide under these regulations? A. No specific training is required for safety-s ensitive em ployees for alcohol m isuse; however, 60 m inutes of instruction is re quired for e mployees on prohibite d drug use. Supervisors who make reasonable suspicion determ inations m ust receive 60 m inutes of training for drugs and 60 m inutes to detect the signs and symptom s of alcohol m isuse for a com bined total of 2 hours. RECORD KEEPING Q. The rule mandates the retention of many reco rds for vary ing periods of time. W ho would be responsible fo r mainta ining the reco rds of an agency that ce operation - especia lly private nonp rofit ag encies that have no direct connection w ith a successor agency? A. Recipients have the ultim ate responsibility to maintain the reco rds. In the case of a defunct agency, the recip ient wo uld be respo nsible to FTA f or maintaining th e rec ords. The company should ensure that this req uirement is met in the event of the s ituation des cribed above. A possible repository of these records could be the state DOT or its legal counsel. Q. The confidentiality of tests is an in tegral part of the overall pr ogram. Can results of alcohol or d rug tests be kept as part of a p ermanent perso nnel file, es pecially if the files contain oth er materia ls that are p art of a grievance or termination process? A. Employers are required to m aintain drug and alcohol testing r ecords in a s ecure m anner, so that disclosure of information to unauthorized persons does not oc cur. It is suggested that test results be m aintained in a confidential drug and alcohol file separate from personnel files to ensure employee privacy and preven t unauthorized inform ation disclosure. Q. How should forms be filled out w hen one person performs several safety-sens itive functions? In small agencies a sup ervis or may be a backu p driver or a driver may double as a dispatcher. A. The em ployee should be accounted f or in whichever safety -sensitiv e function constitu tes the most of his or her on-duty tim e. REHABILI TATION Q. Does the FTA require treatment o r rehab ilitation as a mandatory requirement of a transit operator's substance abus e program? If so, w ho pays? A. The FTA does not require re habilitation for e mployees. If an em ployee undergoes treatm ent, the rule does not address the issu e of who should pay for it. We believe that this issue should be decided at the local level. Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-8 August 2002 DRUG T ESTING Q. Is testing for additional drugs authoriz ed? M ust a separate specimen be obtained? A. Under 49 CFR part 40, an em ployer m ust test for the following drugs: marijuana, cocaine, ampheta mines, opiates, and phencyclidine. An employer m ay not test for any other substances under DOT authority. 49 CFR part 40 does not, however, prohibit an em ployer from testing for other controlled substances as long as that testing is done under the authority of the employer . Employers in the transportation industry who establish a drug testing program that tests beyond the five drugs currently required by 49 CFR part 40 must also make a clear distinction to their em ployees what testing is required by DOT authority and what testing is required by the com pany. Additionally, em ploye rs must ensure that DOT urine specim ens are co llected in acco rdance with th e provision s outlined in 49 CFR part 40 and that a separa te specim en collection process including a separate act of urination is used to obtain specim ens for com pany testing program s. PREP ARATION FOR TESTI NG Q. Does the regulation require the drug test ing custody and control form to have a pre- printed specimen ID n umber? A. 49 CFR part 40 does require use of a federal drug testing custody and control form that has a unique preprinted specim en identification num ber on all cop ies of the f orm. The label o n the specim en bottle m ust also bear th e sam e specimen identification num ber as that on the custody and contro l form accom panying the specim en. I f the specim en identification num ber on the bottle and on the custody and control fo rm do not m atch, the specim en's chain of custody is broken and the test is cancelled. Q. Can the drug testing custody and control form be used for non-DOT tests? A. Employee drug testing conducted under local, state, or private authority should not be represented to the em ployee as being federally mandated or required. The use of the custody and control form required under 49 CFR part 40 c onveys that the testing is being conducted in acco rdance with applicable federal regu lations . Thus a DOT for m can not be used for a non-DOT test. Q. Is the collection of blood or hair auth orized? Can blood or hair specimens be supported by the drug testing custody and cont rol form? Can blood or hair test results be used to take DOT-requi red administrative actions? A. The collection of blood or hair for drug tes ting under DOT authority is not authorized. Therefore, while a com pany, under its own author ity, m ay require a blood or hair specim en to be collected and tested for drugs and/or alcohol under certain circum stances, it is not Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-9 August 2002 acceptable f or the com pany-requ ired blood or hair specim en to be supported by the sam e custody and control form that acco mpanies a DOT-required urine specim en. Under no circum stances can the results of the blo od or hair test be used to take adm inistra tive or disciplinary action against an em ployee using DOT authority for the reasons cited above. Q. How and to whom are drug testing custody and control forms distributed? A. The only acceptable procedures for handling th e custody and control form as specified in 49 CFR part 40 (\u00a740.73) are as follows: Parts 1 m ust accom pany the urine specim en in a sealed contain er to the labo ratory; Part 2 (MRO) m ust be sent from the collection site d irectly to the physician (MRO); Part 3 is retained by the collec tion site personnel; and Part 4 is provided to the em ployer representative, and Part 5 is gi ven to the donor at the collection site. Q. Must the collector provide a real n ame on the collector certifica tion s ection of drug testing custody and control form? A. The intent of the DOT drug testing custody form is to provide com plete docum entation of the specim en collection process, including the nam e of the collector and the location of the collection site. The collection site p erson w ho receives the urine specim en from the donor should be identified by nam e on the block spec ifying \"collector's nam e.\" Use of a \"code nu mber, or oth er substitu tion for the co llector's nam e is not acceptab le. The collector's nam e should be th e sam e as that appearing on th e identification each collector is required to m ake available to the donor, if so requested. Q. Are middle names requ ired on the dr ug testin g custody and control form? A. 49 CFR part 40, Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs , specifies that the custody and control form used to document DOT- mandated drug testing shall provide space for collector, donor, and laboratory certifying scientist nam es and signatures. The regulation does not specify that a m iddle nam e must be used. The intent of the regulation is to provide for the identification of the pers on(s) signing the certification statem ents. The use of supplem ental instruct ions on the custody and control form (e.g. further defining nam e to include first, m iddle, last), does not impact on the security, identification, or integrity of the urine speci men and should not be used as a basis for invalidating the specim en results. Q. Is the MRO name required on the drug testin g custody and control form? Can the MRO's co mpany name be used instead? A. The regulation, 49 CFR Part 40.45 (c) (2), spec ifies that the MRO info rmation m ust include the specific physician's nam e and address, as opposed to only a generic clinic, health care organization, or com pany nam e. Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-10 August 2002 SPECIMEN COLLECTION PROCEDURES Q. Is the collector's name required on th e drug testing custod y and control form? A. Pursuant to 49 CFR part 40, the collector's na me and signature are required as part of the collection p rocess. This is neces sary to ensu re the integ rity of the testing p rocess and to initiate the chain of custody. It is the Departm ent's position that an i ndividual subm itting to testing under this rule shall have a reciprocal right to know th e collector's nam e and to see the collec tor's work iden tification Q. May donors be required to strip, w ear a hospital gow n, or empty pockets? A. The Departm ent's procedures for trans portation workplace drug tes ting program s contained in 49 CFR part 40, December 1, 1989, \u00a740.61(f)(3 )(4) states: \"You m ust not ask the employee to rem ove other clothing (e.g., shirts, pants, dresses, underwear), to rem ove all clothing, or to change into a hospital or exam ination gown ( unless the urine collection is being accom plished s imultaneou sly w ith a DOT agency-au thorized m edical exam ination). You m ust direct the em ployee to empty his or her pockets and display the item s in the m to ensure that no item s are present which could be used to adulterate the specim en. If not hing is there that can be used to a dulterate a specim en, the em ployee can place th e item s back into his or her pockets. As the em ployee, you m ust allow the collector to m ake this observation.\" Q. Is a consent form autho rized? A. Consent for ms are prohibited by 49 CFR Part 40.355 (a) Q. Is the donor's presence required when the collector prep ares a specimen for shipment? A. The tam per-proof seal placed on the specim en bottle m ust be affixed in th e presen ce of the donor, but the regulation is clear that the dono r does not have to be present when the specim ens are prep ared f or shipm ent to the labor atory. In fact, the rule allows the use of shipm ent containe rs that accomm odates m ultiple specim en bottles. It would be im possible to have m ore than one donor witness the sealing of their specimen bottles in one shipm ent container w hen collectors are re stricted by rule to adm inister to only one donor at a tim e. Q. What should donors do if specimen collection p rocedures a re not being follow ed? A. Under DOT agency regulations, the employer is responsible for ensuring that specim ens are collected in accordan ce with 49 CFR part 40. If the em ployees subject to DOT- mandated drug testing regulations believe that collection procedures are not being followed as prescribed in 49 CFR pa rt 40, they should so in form the e mployer. If the em ployer does not respond to the com plaints and take appropriate corrective actions, th e employees m ay seek resolu tion of their com plaints throug h a DOT ag ency that has regulatory authority over the employer. Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-11 August 2002 Q. In a post-accident situation requiring both a company test and a DOT test, w hich should be conducted first? A. In a post-accident situation in which dr ug/alcohol testing is required under com pany authority or policy, and DOT m andated tests ar e required, the DOT tests must be conducted first. Q. Is failure to check the temperature box on the Drug Testing custody and control form considered a fatal flaw ? A. In acco rdance with 49 C FR part 40 Section 40.65 , the collector is to ch eck the tem perature of the spec imen to ensure the integ rity of the sp ecim en. The fact that it was checked should be marked appropriately on the custody and control form . Inadvertently not marking the temperature taken box, in and of its elf, does not constitute a \"fat al flaw\" in the DOT chain of custody process. However, a corrective action on the part of the collector m ust take place. REPORTI NG AND REVIEW OF RESULTS Q. When can the MRO notify an employer of a positive drug test resu lt? A. The MRO may not notify the em ployer of a positive test until he/she has verified the test as positiv e. Verification require s that the MRO review the chain of custody docum entation, contact the employee, offer the employee the opportunity to expl ain the test result, review any docum entation of a legitim ate medica l expla nation f or a positiv e test, and dete rmine that the positive resulted from unauthorized use of a controlled substance. T he MRO is not required to delay verification pending the outco me of the split analysis. Upon verification, the MRO shall notify the em ployer of the positiv e result, and the em ployer shall then rem ove the em ployee from their safety-sensitive dutie s/position. Once having received notice of a verified pos itive result from the MRO, the em ployer shall not delay removal of the employee from safety-sensitive du ties pend ing the outcom e of the reana lysis or the s plit analys is. In a cas e where th e em ployee refuses to speak to the MRO, or the MRO and the em ployer are unable to co ntact the em ployee, th e MRO m ay veri fy the test result witho ut speak ing to the employee. Q. Please explain the release of drug te st results for unempl oyment co mpensation . A. The provisions of 49 CFR part 40 do not perm it the em ployer, sim ply on the basis of a claim for une mploym ent com pensation being filed, to pr otest in full from the outset, citing the positiv e dru g test and f urnishing all r elated docu ments. If the em ployee's dism issal is based on m isconduct as defined in com pany policy, an d the em ployee protests the dism issal for cause, the employer m ay introduce drug test inf ormation during the hearing or appeal process as evidence of violation of the company policy prohibiting drug use. The drug testing laboratory m ay release drug te st infor mation to the decision-m aker in a proceed ing initiated by o r on behalf o f the em ployee and arisin g from a certified pos itive drug test. Drug test results m ay be released by the laboratory to the em ployer at the hearing Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-12 August 2002 or appeal process, but not at the initial fili ng for benefits. Docum entation of the Medical Review Officer's verification of a certified laboratory result is available to the em ployer and the em ployee. The DOT regulations do not requ ire that em ployees who test positiv e be discharg ed, only that they can not perform safety-sens itive f unction s until again qualif ied in accordan ce with the applicable provisions of the regulations. Accordingly, any decision to discharge an employee who tests positive m ust be based on so me grounds independent of the positive test result (an employer policy, for example). If a discharged employee late r asserts in a claim for une mploym ent com pensation that he/she had not violated the com pany policy on drug use, inform ation about the results of a drug test could be introdu ced by the em ployer. Additionally, the DOT has no opinion on the stat e's ruling on the em ployee's en titlement to unem ployment com pensation. LABORATORIES Q. Why use DHHS-certified laborato ries? A. DOT requires that all drug testing mandated under the provisions of its drug testing rule m ust be conducted in DHHS- certified laboratories. DOT decided to requ ire the use of DHHS- certified laboratories for drug te sting m andate in the regulated industries for several reasons. Most sign ificantly, the DHHS standards for certification and the proficiency testing requirem ents com prise the m ost stringent labo ratory accred itation program available in analytical forensic toxicology for urine dr ug testing. Additionally, the DHHS-certification program provides for standardization of la boratory m ethodology and procedures, ensuring equal treatment of all sp ecim ens analyze d. And finally, the use of DHHS-certified laboratories provides a standard th at has withstood the test of le gal challenges in federal drug testing. Q. Is use of a consortium to conduct random testing allow ed? A. The Departm ent allows and even ad vocates the use of a consortium to assist sm aller companies in com plying with the cu rrent drug tes ting regulations. W hile it is true that in a combined employer pool, som e employers will ha ve a higher percentage of their em ployees selected for testing than others in a g iven 12- month period, ov er tim e this will even ou t. Additionally, the Departm ent believes that th e deterrent effect of random drug testing remains as powerful in a com bined employers po ol as it would be in a stand-alone single company pool. W ith this in m ind, the Depart ment has determ ined that com bining employer pools within a consortium m eets the spirit and intent of the drug testing regulations and is, therefore, p ermissible. Q. Can an employer combine DOT and non-DOT random pools? A. While it would seem advantageous f or an employer to com bine all em ployees in to on e random testing pool, this m ove could dilute the num ber of DOT-covered em ployees who would actually be tested. For exam ple, in a pool that is com prised of 50 DOT-covered Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-13 August 2002 employees and 50 non-DOT e mployees, and assum ing a testing rate of 50 percent, it is possible that no DOT-covered em ployees would be tested (100 em ployees, 50 tests, all 50 tests conducted on nonDOT e mployees). The like lihood of this happening, albeit rem ote, is possible under a truly random scheme. On the other hand, keeping the above two classes of employees in separate pools assures that at least 25 of the tests conducted by the company will be cond ucted on DOT em ployees. It is th is assurance tha t ultim ately m andates DOT- covered em ployees remain in separate random pools. Q. Can an employer combine emplo yees covered by different operatin g administration rule into a single pool for random testing? A. The Departm ent has determ ined that it is perm issible for an employer to com bine covered employees from different operating adm inistra tions, (e.g. Federal Moto r Carrier's Safety Adm inistration, Coast Guard, and Federal T ransit Adm inistration) into a single selection pool for the purpose of conducting random drug tes ting under DOT authority. W hen exercising this option, however, the em ployer mu st ensure that the random testing rate is at least equal to the h ighest rate requ ired by each of the operatin g adm inistrations. Q. Is it permissible to sep arate union and no nuni on employees, both covered by DOT, into stand-alone pools? A. The Departm ent has determ ined that it is perm issible for an employer to separate union and nonunion employees into separate pools for the pur pose of random drug testing. If using this approach, th e em ployer must ensure that the employees from each pool are tested at equal rates. For exam ple, if pool \"A\" consists of 50 nonunion employees a nd pool \"B\" consists of 50 union employees, the em ployer must ensure, if te sting is done at a 50 percent rate, that 25 tests are con ducted annu ally on em ployees from each pool. Q: If an a pplicant ad mits to te sting positive on or refusing to take a pre-emplo yment te st within the past 2 years, must the ap plicant be held out of safety-sensitive duties if he or she did not complete the return-to- duty process (i.e., the SAP process)? A: If the ap plican t adm its tha t he or she had a positive or a re fusal to te st result on a p re- employm ent test, the em ployer is not perm itted to use the app licant to perf orm safety- sensitive duties until and unless the applican t doc uments succ essful com pletion of the return - to-duty process. This Part 40 requirem ent applies whether or not the pre-employm ent positiv e or refusal occurred before, o n, or after A ugust 1, 200 1. Should no proof exist that the return -to-duty proces s was succes sfully com plied with by the applicant, a current return- to-duty process m ust occur before the indi vidual can again perfor m safety-sensitive functions. Q: When a n employee leaves an employer fo r a period of time (but n ot exceed ing 2 years) and returns to that same employer, must the employer on ce again seek to obtain informa tion it may hav e received previously from other employers? Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-14 August 2002 A: No. If the inform ation rece ived previously is still on file with the em ployer, the employer need not seek to obtain the testing data again. However, the employer m ust seek inform ation from all other em ployers for whom the em ployee perform ed safety-sensitive duties since the employee last worked for the em ployer. Q: Because Part 40 req uires co llectors, MR Os, BATs and STTs, and SAPs to maintain their ow n training reco rds, can employers or training entities refu se to provide these service agents their tra ining records? A: No. Employers and trainers who provide training for these se rvice agents m ust not withhold training docum entation f rom them when they have successfully com pleted the training requirem ents. If a collector, BAT, STT, MRO, or SAP is not in po ssession of training docum entation, he or she is in violation of Pa rt 40. Therefore, Part 40 does not perm it the withholding of such docum entation from these service agents. Q: Is error correction training required if a drug test is can celled due to a specimen havin g an insufficient amount of urine? A: If the laboratory finds there is an insu fficient am ount of urine in the prim ary bottle for analys is, the labora tory will r eport to the MRO th at the specim en is \"reje cted for testing\" (unless the laboratory can rede signate the specimens). Subs equently, the MRO must cancel the test. The MRO should seek to determ ine (w ith the assistance of the laboratory) if the specim en leaked in transit or if not enough ur ine was collected. Specim en leakage while in trans it to a laborato ry will not cause a cance llation requiring the collector to have error correction training. If the labor atory finds no evidence of leak age, indications would be strong that the collector failed to collect the appr opriate am ount of urine. If this were the case, the collector would need error correction training. If specim en leakage is a recurrent problem for a collection site, the MR O may be wise to inquire whethe r or not the shipping contain ers used are sufficient to adeq uately protect the specim ens or whe ther or not collectors are securing th e bottle lids properly. Q: Where c an billing information be entered o nto the Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (CCF)? A: 40.45(c)(1) states that the CCF my include bi lling inform ation if the infor mation is in the area outside the border of the fo rm. Therefore, if account codes or collection site codes are entered, they m ust be placed outs ide the border, only. CCFs with this inform ation pre-prin ted inside the border (i.e., in the Step 1 box) m ay be used until the supply of these form s is exhausted. CCFs produced or re-ordered af ter February 15, 2002, m ust not have this information inside the bo rder. No cor rective ac tion is needed nor will a re sult be im pacted if the CCF contains this inf ormation ins ide th e border. However, em ployers and service providers may be subject to enforcem ent action if this requirem ent is not m et. Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-15 August 2002 Q: What actual address is required for \"Collect ion Site Address\" in Step 1 of th e CCF, and what teleph one number should the collector p rovide? A: The collection site address s hould reflect the location where th e collection takes p lace. If the collection takes place at a clin ic, the actual address of that clinic should be used: not a corporate or a \"m ain office\"address o f the clin ic/collection co mpany. If the collectio n takes place on -site at the em ployer's p lace of business (e .g., a bus term inal, a rail yard), the actual address of the em ployer site should be used. If the collection takes place in a \"m obile unit\" or takes p lace at an accid ent site, th e colle ctor sh ould ente r the actua l location add ress of the collection (or as near an appr oxim ation as possible, under the ci rcum stances). The required collector telephone number should be the num ber at which it is m ost likely that the laboratory, MRO, or e mployer, if necessary, m ay contact the collector an d the collector's supervisor. Pre-printing certain inform ation onto the CCF is problem atic if the information is subject to change. Q: Can a collector ma rk through pre-printe d employer, MRO, collection site, and/or laboratory information on the CCF if that in formation is not accurate for a particular colle ction? A: Yes. W hen the co llector has no \"blank\" CCFs and the C CFs on-hand contain in accurate pre- printed em ployer, MRO, collection site, and/ or laboratory inform ation, the collector is perm itted to \"line throug h\" the in accurate information and ins ert legib ly the proper inform ation. The likelihood of a collection site having CCFs with inaccurate inform ation increases with unexpected collection events (e.g., em ployee arrives unannounced for post- acciden t testing). If the specim en will be s ent to a laboratory different tha n the one pre- printed on the available CCF, it becom es important for the co llector to m odify the CCF so that it r eflects the nam e and address o f the labor atory to which the spec imen will ac tually be sent. It is also im portant for the collector to line through any pre-pr inted billing code and insert the appropriate on e, if it is available. Finally, labo ratories should honor collection site requests to provide an adequate num ber of \"blank\" CCFs for use during unexpected colle ction e vents. I t is importa nt to note that the DOT per mits overprinting or pre-printing of CCFs in an ef fort to str eamline the e ntire testing process, not to lim it the distribution of the forms to collection sites. Q: If the p rimary labo ratory mus t redesignate bottle B for bottle A, can the lab oratory test the specimen if only 15 mL of urine is present in the redesignated bottle A? A: The Departm ent tion only in lim ited circum stances - one such occurrence would be if the A specimen has leaked in transit, leaving only the B specim en to be tested. In such a case, th e laboratory should test the rede signated specim en despite the fact that, under norm al circum stances, a suffi cient am ount of specim en would not have been available for testing. Q: Must a certifying scientist's signature be on Copy 1 of the CCF if the drug test result is negative? Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-16 August 2002 A: The certifying scientist's signature m ust be on Copy 1 of t he CCF for non-negative results only. Theref ore, the certifying scientist m ay simply initial (and date) the C CF when the test result is n egative. Q: Must an employer or C/TPA who is required to sub mit blind specimens to laboratories send adulterated or substituted blinds if the employer or C/TPA is not yet havin g specimens undergo validity testing? A: At the present tim e, validity te sting rem ains an em ployer option. Therefore, if an employer or C/TPA required to subm it blind specim ens is not conducting validity testing during the course of its norm al testing, the em ployer or C/T PA needs not send adu lterated o r subs tituted blind specim ens to the laboratories used. However, if an employer or C /TPA conducts validity testing, adulterated or substituted blind specim ens must be sent to the laboratories used. Part 40 requires that approximately 75 percent of the blinds m ust be blank (i.e., contain ing no drugs, nor adulte rated or substitu ted); 15 per cent must be positiv e for one or more drugs; and 10 percent m ust be adulterated or substituted. If the em ployer or C/T PA is not exercising the option to conduct validity test ing, approxim ately 75 percent of blinds m ust be blank and 25 percent must be positive for one or m ore drugs. Q: Is it app ropriate for the MRO to attemp t to contact th e employee after normal office hours? A: Yes. Copy 2 of the CCF contains spaces for the em ployee's daytim e and evening telephon e numbers. We expect MROs or their s taffs to attem pt to contact the employee at the evening phone num ber if the em ployee is not available at the daytim e num ber. Q: May th e MRO rep ort an \"interim\" or \"pre liminary\" test result to the emplo yer (or C/TPA) w hile aw aiting receip t the MRO copy and/or the laborato ry result? A: No. An MRO m ust not repor t tests re sults u ntil and unle ss he or she has rec eived all required inform ation from the collection site and labor atory. This m eans the MRO m ust have Copy 2 or a legible copy of Copy 2 (or any legible c opy of a CCF pa ge signed by the em ployee) and must have the drug test re sult (sent in the a ppropriate m anner for negatives and non- negatives) from the laboratory. An MRO se nding \"in-progress\" negative or non-negative results will be considered to be in violation of Part 40. Q: Can someone other than the employee dire ct that an MRO have the employ ee's split specimen tested? A: No. Because the sp lit spec imen exists to prov ide the em ployee with \"d ue process \" in the event th at he or she des ires to challen ge the prim ary specim en's results, only the em ployee can request that the split speci men be tested. In addition, an employer or a union (or other labor r epresentative) m ay not act on the beha lf of the em ployee in r equesting tha t the split specim en be tested. The em ployee must m ake the request directly to the MRO. Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-17 August 2002 Q: Can a split specimen be sent to a second laboratory tha t is under the same corporate title as the primary laboratory? A: Yes. The rule requires the split specim en to be tested at a different or second HHS-certified laboratory. For exam ple, if the prim ary specim en was tested at XYZ Laboratory in Dallas, TX, the split specim en may be sent to XYZ La boratory in Chicago, IL. HHS certifies each laboratory separately and on its own m erits. Laboratories on the HHS listing of certified laboratories, and those under the same corpor ate title are indiv idually certified and are considered separate and unique from one another. Q: Can the MRO require an emplo yee's split s pecime n test request to be in w riting rather than verbal? A: 40.171(a) states that the em ployee's request may be verbal or in writing. Therefore, the MRO m ust accept a verbal requ est. Th e MRO may ask the employee for written docum entation, but m ust imm ediately honor the verbal request. An MRO should always docum ent whether o r not an em ployee reques ted to have the s plit tes ted. The MRO must docum ent the date and tim e of the employee's request. Q: Do the 5 days w ithin w hich an employee is given to ob tain a medical evaluation after providing an insufficient amount of urine or breath include holidays and w eekends, or does this refer to 5 business days? A: The 5-day lim it for obtaining an exam ination by a licensed physician refers to business days. Therefore, holidays and weekend days should not be included in the 5-day tim e frame. Q: Is error correction training required if an alcohol test is cancelled due to equipment failur e? A: Nor mally, equipm ent failure will not requ ire the BAT to have error correction training. However, if it is d etermined that the equipm ent failu re was re lated to the BAT's f ailure to properly m aintain equipm ent (e.g., the EBT), error correction training w ould be in order. In addition, error correctio n would be required if the BAT does not attem pt to accom plish the test following equipm ent failure using anothe r device - provided th at ano ther dev ice was reasonab ly availab le. Q: Is an employer co nsidered to be in comp liance w ith Part 40 if E BTs are not available within 30 minutes of an alcohol screening test location? A: An e mployer is not considered to be in co mpliance if an EBT is not available for use within 30 m inutes to confirm the screening test. Ho wever, there m ay exist unusual circum stances (e.g., post-accident testing) in which an EBT is not available within the appropriate tim e frame. In such a case, the em ployer would not be considered out of com pliance with the regulation if docum entation exis ts showing a \"good faith\" effort to get an EBT. [It is important to note that most operating adm inistrations give employers up to 8 hours to administer the appropriate alcohol test following a qualifying acciden t.] Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-18 August 2002 Q: May an employer conduct follow -up testin g under company authority that goes beyond the follow -up testing w hich the SAP determines necessary? A: No. The regulation (at 40.307(d)(4)) and SA P guidelines state that employers must not impose additional testing requirem ents that go beyond the S AP's follow-up testing plan. This includes additional testing requirem ents under com pany authority. In addition to follow-up testing and random testin g, an em ployer has oth er means available to ascertain an employee's alcohol- and drug-free perform ance and functions. The em ployer can choose to monitor the em ployee's com pliance with the SAP's recommendations for continuing treatm ent and/or education as part of a retu rn-to-duty agreement with the em ployee. The employer can conduct reasonable suspicion test ing if the em ployee exhibits signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol use. T he em ployer can m eet regularly with the em ployee to discuss their continuing sobriety and drug-free status. The Depa rtment is not opposed to an employer discussing his or her desires for havi ng more than the m inimum rule requirem ent (i.e., 6 tests in the first yea r) for follow-up testing with SA Ps they intend to utilize. Q: If an employee requests his/h er records from the MRO, do these records include the MRO's notes and comments or on ly copies o f the CCF and laboratory result? A: In general, the MRO should pr ovide all records that are availabl e related to that employee, to include written notes, checklists, or comm ents. All of this infor mation was obtained from the employee or from appropriate individuals or organizations (with the em ployee's authorization) or from docum entation provi ded by the em ployee. Consistent with appropriate m edical record constraints, the MR O may need to withhold or interpret sensitive medical, psychiatric, and m ental health record inf ormation. Q: Can an employer w ishing to conduct pre-employment alcohol testing, do so? A: A DOT- regulated employer (except under USCG a nd RSPA rules) wishing to conduct pre- em ploym ent alcohol testing under DOT au thority m ay do so if certain conditions are m et. The testing m ust be accom plished for all ap plicants (i.e., the em ployer cannot select for testing som e applicants and not others) a nd the testing must be conducted as a post-offer requirement (i.e., the em ployer needs to inform the applicant that he or she has the job if he or she passes a DOT alcohol test) In addition, the testing and its cons equences m ust com ply with requirem ents of Part 40. Q: Can the employer act as a Design ated Employer Representative (DER), as opposed to appoin ting another employee to play this role? A: The employer (e.g., the owner of a sm all business) m ay act personally as the DER. The employer m ay also appoint an employee or em ployees to play this role. The DER m ust exercise hi s or her authority to rem ove an em ployee from safety sensitive functions either directly or by causing th e employee to be rem oved fr om perfor ming these functions (e.g., by having the em ployee's supervisor effect the actual rem oval). The employer m ay not delegate the DER ro le to a service agent. Only the em ployer or an Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-19 August 2002 actua l employee of the em ployer may perf orm this f unction. The Departm ent will not authorize a \"DER-for-hire\" concept (e.g., a pers on under contract by several com panies to serve as their DER), eith er. Q: If a C/TPA is hired as an \"independent safe ty consultant\" that executes all aspects of the employer's safety and drug and alco hol testing programs, can the C/TPA act as a DER? A: Service agents are prohibited from acting as DERs under any circum stances. The fact that an organization that is ca lled an \"independent safety consultan t\" acts as a consultant to an em ployer for purposes of executing a drug and alcohol testing or safety program does not m ake it any less a service agent. It is still prohibited from acting as a DER. Q: Can union hiring h alls, driver-leasing comp anies, and other entities have a stand-dow n policy, or is the ability to obtain a waiver for this purp ose limited to actual employers? A: The rule perm its \"employers\" to apply fo r a stand-down waiver. It does not perm it any other e ntity to do s o. Only entities th at are viewed as \"e mployers\" f or purposes of DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regula tions can apply for stand-down waivers. If a DOT agency rule provides that hiring halls, leasing agencies, etc., are treated as em ployers, such organizations coul d apply for a stand-down waiver. Q: Does an employer need a stand-down waiver in order to implement a policy that requires employees to cease p erforming safety-sensitive function s follow ing a reasonable suspicion or post-accident test? A: \u00a740.21 requires an employer to obtain a waiver to do one very specific thing: rem ove em ployees from perfor mance of safety-sensitive functions on the basis of the report of confirmed laborator y test resu lts that hav e not yet been verified by the MRO. An e mployer does not need a \u00a740.21 waiver to take other actions involving the perfor mance of safety-sensitive functions. F or exam ple, an em ployer could (if it is not prohibited by DOT agency regulations and it is consiste nt with applicable labo r-managem ent agreem ents) have a com pany policy saying that, on th e basis of an event (e.g., the occurrence of an acciden t that requires a DOT post-acciden t test, the find ing of reasonable suspicio n that leads to a DOT reasonable suspicion test ), the em ployee would imm ediately stop perform ing safety-sensitive functions. Such a polic y, which is not triggered by the MRO's rece ipt of a confirm ed laboratory test result, would not require a \u00a740.21 waiver. It would not be appropriate for an em ployer to rem ove em ployees from perform ance of sa fety-sensitive functions pending the result of a random or follow-up test, s ince the re is no trigg ering event to which the action could rationally be tied. Q: When an employer is inquiring about an applicant's previous DOT drug and alcohol test results, is the employer required to send the inquiry via certified mail? A: No. Certified m ail is not requir ed. The em ployer can m ake th is inquiry through a variety of means, including m ail (certified or not), fax, telephone, or em ail. Howe ver, the em ployer Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-20 August 2002 must provide the form er em ployer the signed release or a faxed or scanned copy of the employee's signed release. The form er employer must respond via a written response (e.g., fax, letter, em ail) that ensure s confidentiality. The em ployer should docum ent an attempt or attem pts to contact and contact s with previous em ployers, no m atter how they were m ade, so that it can show a good faith effort to obtain the required inform ation. Q: When a previous employer receives an inquiry from a new empl oyer for drug and alcohol testing information, does th e previous employer provide information it may have receiv ed from oth er employ ers in the pa st? A: As an employer, when you receive an inquiry about a form er employee, you m ust provide all the inform ation in your possession concerning the em ployee's DOT drug and alcohol tests that occurred in the 2 years preceding the inquiry. This includes inform ation you received about an em ployee from a for mer employer (e .g., in response to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Adm inistration's pre-em ploym ent inquiry requirem ent). It is not a violation of Part 40 or DOT agency rules if you provide, in a ddition, inform ation about the employee's DOT drug and alcohol tests obtained from former em ployers that dates back m ore than 2 years ago. Q: If a collector makes a mist ake resulting in a cancella tion of a test before he or she has obtained qualification training (e.g., in th e period before January 31, 2003), does he or she have to obtain erro r correction training un der \u00a740.33(f)? A: Yes. If a collecto r makes a m istake th at causes a test to be cance lled, the collector m ust undergo error correction training (even if th e collector has yet to undergo qualification training). T here are no excep tions to this requirem ent. Q: A collector w ho is notified that he or sh e made a mistake has 30 d ays in w hich to obtain error correction tra ining. Can the collect or continue to p erform DOT collection s during this 30-day period? A: Yes. A collector m ay continue to perform DOT collections during this period. After 30 days have elapsed following the notification to the co llecto r of the need to obtain error correction training, th e collector is no longer qu alified to conduct DOT collection s until and unless he or she has successfully com pleted error correction training. As provided in \u00a740.209(b)(3), collection of a specim en by a collector who ha s not m et training requirements does not result in the cancellation of the test, assum ing the coll ection is otherwise proper. However, use of an unqualified collector can re sult in enforcem ent action. Q: Who is responsible for no tifyin g a collecto r that error correction training is needed? A: The MRO, in canceling a drug te st, will d etermine if the collec tor is at f ault. W hen the MRO reports the c ancelled te st to the em ployer, the M RO will note the r eason f or the canc ellation and that, if appropriate, it was the result of co llector erro r. Th e em ployer or serv ice ag ent (e.g., MRO, C/TPA) designated by the em ployer is responsible for notifying the collection site of the er ror and th e retraining req uirement; and for ensurin g that the training takes p lace. Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-21 August 2002 Q: Must collectors, BATs, STTs, MROs, a nd SAPs maintain documentation of meeting training requirements on their persons? A: These individuals are responsible for m aintaining documentation that they currently m eet all training requirem ents (see, for example, \u00a740.33(g)). However, they are not required to keep this docum entation on their person. T hey m ust be able to produce this docum entation within a short, reasonable tim e of a request by a DOT representative or an em ployer. Nothing precludes an organization (e.g., a collection site) from also main taining a file of the training records of its personnel, if it wishes to do so. Q: What d oes the rule require w ith respect to the qualifications of persons w ho train collectors? A: Part 40 does not specify any set of specific qualifications f or persons w ho train collectors. The training m ust cover the item s required by Part 40. Q: Does a person w ho monitors p roficienc y demonstrations as a part of collector qualification training have to be a qualified co llector? A: Yes. It is very im portant for persons who m onitor m ock collec tions to have a thorough \"book\" and practical knowledge of relevant DOT rules and pro cedures. It is also very important that, before determ ining whethe r trainees have successfully com pleted a proficiency dem onstration, the m onitor have experienced and successfully com pleted the same training that collectors have to undergo. Consequently, mock collection m onitors have to meet collector qualification training requirements. In addition, the m onitor m ust meet any one of three other requirem ents. The m onitor can be a qualified collector who has regularly conducted D OT drug testing collections for a least a year before serving as a m onitor, or the monitor can be a qualified collector who has had a \"train-the-trainer\" course. Such a course could include the m andatory elem ents of collect or qualification training as well as ins truction on how to conduct training effectively, or the monitor can be a qualified collector who has conducted collector training under P art 40 for at least a year befo re serving as a m onitor. Monitors in the second and third categories do no t need to practice actively as collectors, so long as they have m et collector qualification re quirem ents. Individuals acting as collectors prior to August 1, 2001, have until January 31, 2003, to m eet qualification training requirem ents. In the m eantim e, such collector s can serve as monitors even though they m ay not have m et the qualification and m ock collecti on requirements (so long as they m eet any one of the three other requirem ents). Q: How should the employer's decision to have a C/TPA act as intermediary in the handling of drug test results be documented? A: W hen an em ployer chooses to use the C/TPA as the interm ediary in the transm ission of the MRO's verified drug test resu lts, this decision should be co mmunicated from the em ployer to the MRO and the C/TPA. W e advise the MRO to obtain som e docum entation of the employer's decision prior to sending results th rough the C/TPA. Docum entation could be in the form of a letter, an em ail, or record of a telephone conversation with the em ployer. DOT Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-22 August 2002 also recomm ends that MROs m aintain listings of the nam es, addre sses, and phone num bers of C/TPA points of contact. Q: May th e MRO's a ddress entered on th e CCF be a post office box number only? A: No. The address m ust contain at least a num ber and street address. The reason for this requirem ent is that CCFs are often delivered by courier or m essenger services who do not deliver items to post office box addresses. The po st office box can be included, but not in lieu of the num ber and street address. Q: May a D OT urine specimen be obtained vi a catheterization from a patient w ho is catheteriz ed as part of a medica l procedure or who is unconscious? A: No one is ever pe rmitted to obta in a urine sp ecimen for DOT testing p urposes f rom an unconscious individu al, whether by cathe terization or any other m eans. No one is perm itted to catheterize a conscious em ployee for the pur pose of collecting urine for a DOT drug test. However, if a person has been catheteri zed for medical purposes (e.g., a conscious, hospita lized patien t in a post-ac ciden t test situation), it is pe rmissib le to use urine colle cted by this m eans for DOT testing purposes. A ll necessary docum entation for a DOT collection must be provided (e.g., the CCF). In a ddition, an em ployee who nor mally voids through self-catheterization is required to provide a specim en in that m anner. Q: Part 40 directs the collector to discard the firs t specimen if the temperature w as out of range or th e specimen show ed signs of tampering and the employee refused to p rovide a second specimen under direct observation. Th e Urine Specimen Collection Guid elines [at Section 8, Directly Observed Collection, N umber 7] in dicate tha t, in such a situation, the first specimen should be retained and sent to the laboratory. Which requirement is correct? A: W hen a specim en is out of tem perature range or shows signs of tam pering and the em ployee refuses to provide a second specim en under direct observation, it is cons idered a refusal to test. The collector does not retain the first specim en, but dis cards it. The requirem ent in the Urine Specim en Collection Guidel ines, Version 1.0, to retain th e specim en and send it to the laboratory, was inserted inadve rtently. Urine Specim en Collection Guidelines, Version 1.01, contain the proper procedur es as directed by 40.65. Q: Can the monitor (or direct observer) o f a collection be a co-w orker or immediate supervisor of the emp loyee? A: The imm ediate supervisor of a particular empl oyee m ay not act as the collecto r when that employee is tested, unles s no other c ollector is a vailab le and the superv isor is pe rmitted to do so under a D OT operating adm inistration's dr ug and alcohol regulation. T he imm ediate supervisor m ay act as a m onitor or observer (i f sam e gender) if there is no alternate m ethod at the collection site to conduct a m onitored or observed collection. An employee who is in a safety-sensitive position and subject to the DOT drug testing rules shoul d not be a collector, Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-23 August 2002 an observer, or a m onitor for co-workers w ho are in the sam e testing pool or who work together with that em ployee on a daily basis. Q: Afte r the laborator y reports a test r esult, someone (e.g., the em ployer, a service agent) discovers that the CCF listed the wrong reaso n for the test (e.g., the C CF says the test was a pre-employment test w hen it w as actua lly a random test). How is this corre cted and by w hom? A: This is another example of an error that doe s not have a significant ad verse effect on the right of an e mployee to have a fair and accurate te st (see \u00a740.209). The test is not cancelled as the result of such a m istake. W hile concerned part ies m ay wish to correct the faulty description of the reason for the test, Part 40 does not re quire a correction to be m ade. Em ployers or their designated servic e agents should ensure that appr opriate changes are docum ented (e.g., for MIS rep orting pu rposes). Q: Must a n MRO use the full 24 -hour period to contact the donor if the MRO is sure that the donor is not and w ill not be ava ilable a t the phone numbers provid ed by the donor? A: 40.131(a)(1) states that if th e phone num bers provided by th e donor are wrong, an MRO m ay contact the DER to inform the donor to contact the MRO without waiting the full 24 hours. If the MRO discovers th at phone nu mbers provi ded by the d onor will no t perm it the MRO to contact the donor within the 24-hour period, the MRO m ay contact the D ER immediately. For exam ple, the MRO m ay discover that the em ployee is not expected to be available for another 5 days at the number provided. Q: Can arbitrators change or overturn the MR O's determination about the verification of a test result? A: No. The MRO is the only person authorized to change a verified te st result (see \u00a740.149(c)). The MRO can do so with respect to a verifi cation decision he or she has m ade, in the circum stances described in \u00a740.149. An arbitrat or is som eone who derives his authority from the employer, or from a labor-m anage ment agreem ent. The arbitrator cannot exercise authority that the em ployer coul d not exercise on its own. The arbitrator could not overturn a decision of the MRO concerning a test verifica tion any m ore than the employer could on its own. This prohibition applies to substantive de cisions the MRO m akes a bout the m erits of a test (e.g., with respect to whet her there is a legitim ate medical explanation for a positive, adulterated, or substituted test result or whether a medical co ndition precluded an individual from providing a sufficient specim en). An arbitr ator could determ ine that a test result should be cancelled because of a defect in the drug testing process involving th e MRO (e.g., that the MRO failed to afford the em ployee the opportuni ty for a verification interview). But an arbitrator could not overturn the substantiv e judgm ent of the MRO about whether, for exam ple, the inf ormation subm itted by the em ployee constitu ted a leg itimate m edical explanation. Q. What is an employer to do if an arbitrator 's decision claims to overturn the result of a DOT drug or alcohol test on grou nds contrary to DOT regulations? Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-24 August 2002 A: There co uld be ins tances in which an arbitrato r makes a decision that purports to cancel a DOT test for reasons that the DOT regulation doe s not recognize as valid. For exam ple, the arbitrator m ight m ake a decision based on a disagreem ent with an MRO's judgm ent about a legitim ate medical explanation (see \u00a740.149) or on the basis of a procedural error that is not sufficient to cancel a test (see \u00a740.209). Su ch a test result rem ains valid under DOT regulations, notwithstanding the ar bitrator's decision. Conseque ntly, as a m atter of federal safety regulation, the employer m ust not return the em ployee to the perform ance of safety- sensitive functions until the em ployee has co mpleted the return-to-duty process. The employer may still be bound to im plem ent the pe rsonnel policy outcom e of the arbitrator's decis ion in s uch a case. This can res ult in h ardship for the e mployer (e .g., being required to pay an individual at the sam e time as the De partment's rules preven t the individual from perform ing the duties of his job). Q: Is it acceptable for an MRO to transmit a number of reports of d rug test results per page to the employer, ra ther than one per page? A: The Departm ent recommends that MROs use C opy 2 of the CCF as the m eans of r eporting all drug test results to employe rs. However, if you use a wri tten report (all results) or an electronic report (negative resu lts) m eeting all the requireme nts of \u00a740.163, rather than using Copy 2 of the CCF for this purpose, you m ust put only one such report on each page. T his will he lp to prevent inad verten t breaches of confidentiality b y the em ployer resu lting from photocopyin g a multiple result repo rt and put ting a copy in th e file of each em ployee involved. Q: If the MRO uses a w ritten report instead of a copy of the CCF to report results to employers, how should those reports be signed ? A: The MRO m ust sign all reports of non-nega tive results (i.e. , positiv es, refusals, tes ts canceled, and invalids). The MRO or an MRO' s staff m ember may rubber stam p and initial negative results. The rubber stam p should identify the MRO. E ach written report should be dated and indicate the address of the MRO. Q: May an employer h ave a policy of declin ing to hire ap plicants w ho have a negative dilute test result on a p re-employment drug test? A. The Departm ent's rules do not require an em ployer to hire anyone. T hat is an employer's decision. While \u00a740.197(b) authorizes an em ployer to obtain one additional test following a negative dilute result (in pre-em ploym ent or othe r testing s ituations ), a ne gative d ilute test result is a valid negative test for DOT's purpos es. Because a n egativ e dilu te tes t resu lt is a negative test for DOT pr ogram purposes, the em ployer is authorized to have the applicant begin perform ing safety-sensitive functions. If the em ployer declin es to h ire the applicant in this situation, the em ployer's decision is ba sed solely on its own policy. The em ployer cannot claim that its action is requ ired or authorized by DOT rules. Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-25 August 2002 Q: If a collector makes an error o n a CCF an d the collector is not av ailable to sign a corrective statement (e. g., collector on vacat ion, no longer w ith the company), ca n the collector's s upervisor sign the co rrectiv e sta tement for th e collector? A: If the error was the use of a non-DOT for m (to include use of the old Federal CC F), the collector o r the collecto r's supervisor m ay sign the correctiv e statem ent ex plain ing the circum stances of why a non-DOT form was used. If the m issing inform ation is the printed name and signature of the collector, neither th e collector nor the supe rvisor m ay supply the missing inform ation. This is a fatal, uncorrect able flaw. If the CCF contains the printed name of the collector, but the si gnature is m issing, the collector or the collecto r's sup ervisor may attest that that collector perform ed the coll ection, but did not sign his or her nam e. If the employee's signatu re is om itted and there is no notation in th e \"Rem arks\" line, on ly the collector can provide th e corrective statem ent. The colle ctor's supervisor cannot sign the correctiv e statem ent. Q: Is it acceptable to affix printed alcohol test results on the back of the Alcohol Testing Form (ATF) rather than on the fro nt? A: \u00a740.243(f) instruct the x the printout of the inform ation from the alcohol testing device to the designated sp ace on the ATF. The designated space on the ATF is on the front of the form. That is wher e BATs and STTs should affix the printouts. However, because th e instructions on the ATF al so perm it the printou t to be affixed to the back of the ATF, the Departm ent has no objections to having the printouts on the back of the ATF. Q: Suppose the SAP fails to make the re quired recommendation fo r education and/or treatment of an employee w ho has violated a DOT agency drug or alcohol testing rule, and simply sends the employee back to the employer for a return-do-duty (RTD) test. What is the employer to do? A: The em ployer should not adm inister an RT D test under these circum stances. The employer should refer the em ployee back to the SAP with direction to prescr ibe education and/or treatm ent and conduct a re-evalu ation of the em ployee to dete rmine whether the em ployee has successfully com plied with the S AP's instru ctions. If th e em ployer has com pounded the problem by having conducted the RTD test and return ed the em ployee to safety-sens itive duties (i.e., only realizes that a m istake has been m ade som e time after the fact), the e mployer should work with the SAP to \"go back and do it right.\" This m eans that the em ployee should be removed from perform ance of safety-s ensitive functions, referred back to the SAP for an education and /or treatm ent prescrip tion, an d re-ev aluated by the S AP for successful compliance. Following the receipt of a successful com pliance report from the SAP, the employer would conduct another RTD test before returning the em ployee to perform ance of safety-sensitive functions. Q: What is meant by \"SAP's ow n letterhead? \" Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-26 August 2002 Appendix G. Questions and Answers G-27 August 2002 A: By \"SAP's own letterhead\" we mean the letterhead the SAP uses in his or her daily counseling practice. If the SAP is in private practice, the SAP should use the letterhead of his or her practice. If the SAP works as an employee assistance professional for an organization, the SAP should use the employee a ssistance program's letterhead. If the SAP works for a community mental health servic e, the SAP should use the community mental health service's letterhead. The Department wants to avoid a SAP network provider requiring the SAP to use the prov ider's letterhead rather than that of the SAP. The Department wants to avoid another service agen t contracting the SAP's services to require the contracted SAP to use the service agent's letterhead. The Department wants to avoid any appearance that anyone changed the SAP's recommendations or that the SAP's report failed to go directly from the SAP to the employer. The Department does not want the SAP to use a \"fill-in-the-blanks\" or \"check-the-appropriate-boxes\" type of pre-printed form, including any that are issued to the SAP by a SAP network provider, to which the network or SAP would affix the SAP's letterhead information. The SAP must generate and complete all information on the SAP report. Q: If an MRO knows the identity of a phy sician responsible for determining whether a DOT-regulated employee is physically qualified to perform safety-sensitive duties (e.g., under Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regulations for physical qualifications of motor carrier drivers) for another company, can the MRO report drug test results as well as medical information to that physician? A: Under \u00a740.327(a), an MRO must report drug te st results and medical information to third parties without the employee's c onsent, under certain circumstances spelled out in the rule. Under \u00a740.327(b), a physician responsible for dete rmining the medical qua lifications of an employee under an applicable DOT agency safety regulation is a party to whom the MRO is instructed to provide this info rmation. Consequently, if an MRO knows the identity of such a physician - even if the physician performs this function for a different employer - the MRO would provide the information. However, the MRO is not required to affirmatively seek out such physicians. Q: When records are stored and transferred electronically, how should they be made available to DOT representatives? A: The obligations of employers and service agents to make records available expeditiously to DOT representatives applies rega rdless of how the records are ma intained. All records must be easily and quickly accessible, legible, and formatted, and stored in a well-organized and orderly way. If electronic reco rds do not meet these criteria, then the employer or service agent must convert them to printed document ation in a rapid and readily auditable way.

[65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41950, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.5 Who issues authoritative inter\u00ad pretations of this regulation? ODAPC and the DOT Gen\u00ad eral Counsel provide written in-49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) terpretations of the provisions of this part. These written DOT interpreta\u00adtions are the only official and authori\u00adtative interpretations concerning the provisions of this part. DOT agencies may incorporate ODAPC/OGC interpre\u00adtations in written guidance they issue concerning drug and alcohol testing matters. Only Part 40 interpretations issued after August 1, 2001, are consid\u00adered valid. \u00a7 40.7 How can you get an exemption from a requirement in this regula\u00ad tion? (a) If you want an exemption from any provision of this part, you must re- quest it in writing from the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, under the provisions and standards of 49 CFR part 5. You must send requests for an exemption to the following address: De\u00adpartment of Transportation, Deputy Assistant General Counsel for Regula\u00adtion and Enforcement, 400 7th Street, SW., Room 10424, Washington, DC 20590. (b) Under the standards of 49 CFR part 5, we will grant the request only if the request documents special or ex\u00adceptional circumstances, not likely to be generally applicable and not con\u00adtemplated in connection with the rule-making that established this part, that make your compliance with a specific provision of this part impracticable. (c) If we grant you an exemption, you must agree to take steps we specify to comply with the intent of the provision from which an exemption is granted. (d) We will issue written responses to all exemption requests. Subpart B\u2014Employer Responsibilities \u00a7 40.11 What are the general respon\u00ad sibilities of employers under this regulation? (a) As an employer, you are respon\u00ad sible for meeting all applicable require\u00ad ments and procedures of this part. (b) You are responsible for all actions of your officials, representatives, and agents (including service agents) in carrying out the requirements of the DOT agency regulations. (c) All agreements and arrangements, written or unwritten, between and among employers and service agents 584 Office of the Secretary of Transportation concerning the implementation of DOT drug and alcohol testing requirements are deemed, as a matter of law, to re-quire compliance with all applicable provisions of this part and DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulations. Compliance with these provisions is a material term of all such agreements and arrangements. \u00a7 40.13 How do DOT drug and alcohol tests relate to non-DOT tests? (a) DOT tests must be completely separate from non-DOT tests in all re\u00adspects. (b) DOT tests must take priority and must be conducted and completed be-fore a non-DOT test is begun. For ex-ample, you must discard any excess urine left over from a DOT test and collect a separate void for the subse\u00adquent non-DOT test. (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, you must not per-form any tests on DOT urine or breath specimens other than those specifically authorized by this part or DOT agency regulations. For example, you may not test a DOT urine specimen for addi\u00adtional drugs, and a laboratory is pro\u00adhibited from making a DOT urine spec\u00adimen available for a DNA test or other types of specimen identity testing. (d) The single exception to paragraph (c) of this section is when a DOT drug test collection is conducted as part of a physical examination required by DOT agency regulations. It is permissible to conduct required medical tests related to this physical examination (e.g., for glucose) on any urine remaining in the collection container after the drug test urine specimens have been sealed into the specimen bottles. (e) No one is permitted to change or disregard the results of DOT tests based on the results of non-DOT tests. For example, as an employer you must not disregard a verified positive DOT drug test result because the employee presents a negative test result from a blood or urine specimen collected by the employee's physician or a DNA test result purporting to question the iden\u00adtity of the DOT specimen. (f) As an employer, you must not use the CCF or the ATF in your non-DOT drug and alcohol testing programs. This prohibition includes the use of the \u00a740.17 DOT forms with references to DOT pro-grams and agencies crossed out. You also must always use the CCF and ATF for all your DOT-mandated drug and alcohol tests. \u00a7 40.15 May an employer use a service agent to meet DOT drug and alco\u00ad hol testing requirements? (a) As an employer, you may use a service agent to perform the tasks needed to comply with this part and DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulations, consistent with the re\u00adquirements of Subpart Q and other ap\u00adplicable provisions of this part. (b) As an employer, you are respon\u00ad sible for ensuring that the service agents you use meet the qualifications set forth in this part (e.g., \u00a7 40.121 for MROs). You may require service agents to show you documentation that they meet the requirements of this part (e.g., documentation of MRO qualifica\u00ad tions required by \u00a7 40.121(e)). (c) You remain responsible for com\u00ad pliance with all applicable require\u00adments of this part and other DOT drug and alcohol testing regulations, even when you use a service agent. If you violate this part or other DOT drug and alcohol testing regulations because a service agent has not provided services as our rules require, a DOT agency can subject you to sanctions. Your good faith use of a service agent is not a de\u00adfense in an enforcement action initi\u00adated by a DOT agency in which your al\u00adleged noncompliance with this part or a DOT agency drug and alcohol regula\u00adtion may have resulted from the serv\u00adice agent's conduct. (d) As an employer, you must not permit a service agent to act as your DER. \u00a7 40.17 Is an employer responsible for obtaining information from its serv\u00ad ice agents? Yes, as an employer, you are respon\u00ad sible for obtaining information re\u00ad quired by this part from your service agents. This is true whether or not you choose to use a C/TPA as an inter\u00admediary in transmitting information to you. For example, suppose an appli\u00adcant for a safety-sensitive job takes a pre-employment drug test, but there is a significant delay in your receipt of 585 \u00a740.19 the test result from an MRO or C/TPA. You must not assume that ''no news is good news'' and permit the applicant to perform safety-sensitive duties before receiving the result. This is a violation of the Department's regulations. \u00a7 40.19 [Reserved] \u00a7 40.21 May an employer stand down an employee before the MRO has completed the verification process? (a) As an employer, you are prohib\u00ad ited from standing employees down, ex\u00ad cept consistent with a waiver a DOT agency grants under this section. (b) You may make a request to the concerned DOT agency for a waiver from the prohibition of paragraph (a) of this section. Such a waiver, if granted, permits you to stand an employee down following the MRO's receipt of a laboratory report of a confirmed posi\u00ad tive test for a drug or drug metabolite, an adulterated test, or a substituted test pertaining to the employee. (1) For this purpose, the concerned DOT agency is the one whose drug and alcohol testing rules apply to the ma\u00ad jority of the covered employees in your organization. The concerned DOT agen\u00ad cy uses its applicable procedures for considering requests for waivers. (2) Before taking action on a waiver request, the concerned DOT agency co\u00ad ordinates with other DOT agencies that regulate the employer's other cov\u00adered employees. (3) The concerned DOT agency pro\u00ad vides a written response to each em\u00ad ployer that petitions for a waiver, set\u00ad ting forth the reasons for the agency's decision on the waiver request. (c) Your request for a waiver must in\u00ad clude, as a minimum, the following ele\u00ad ments: (1) Information about your organiza\u00ad tion: (i) Your determination that standing employees down is necessary for safety in your organization and a statement of your basis for it, including any data on safety problems or incidents that could have been prevented if a stand-down procedure had been in place; (ii) Data showing the number of con- firmed laboratory positive, adulter\u00adated, and substituted test results for your employees over the two calendar years preceding your waiver request, 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) and the number and percentage of those test results that were verified positive, adulterated, or substituted by the MRO; (iii) Information about the work situ\u00ad ation of the employees subject to stand-down, including a description of the size and organization of the unit(s) in which the employees work, the proc\u00adess through which employees will be informed of the stand-down, whether there is an in-house MRO, and whether your organization has a medical dis\u00adqualification or stand-down policy for employees in situations other than drug and alcohol testing; and (iv) A statement of which DOT agen\u00ad cies regulate your employees. (2) Your proposed written company policy concerning stand-down, which must include the following elements: (i) Your assurance that you will dis\u00ad tribute copies of your written policy to all employees that it covers; (ii) Your means of ensuring that no information about the confirmed posi\u00adtive, adulterated, or substituted test result or the reason for the employee's temporary removal from performance of safety-sensitive functions becomes available, directly or indirectly, to anyone in your organization (or subse\u00adquently to another employer) other than the employee, the MRO and the DER; (iii) Your means of ensuring that all covered employees in a particular job category in your organization are treated the same way with respect to stand-down; (iv) Your means of ensuring that a covered employee will be subject to stand-down only with respect to the ac\u00adtual performance of safety-sensitive duties; (v) Your means of ensuring that you will not take any action adversely af\u00adfecting the employee's pay and benefits pending the completion of the MRO's verification process. This includes con\u00adtinuing to pay the employee during the period of the stand-down in the same way you would have paid him or her had he or she not been stood down; (vi) Your means of ensuring that the verification process will commence no later than the time an employee is temporarily removed from the per\u00adformance of safety-sensitive functions 586 Office of the Secretary of Transportation and that the period of stand-down for any employee will not exceed five days, unless you are informed in writing by the MRO that a longer period is needed to complete the verification process; and (vii) Your means of ensuring that, in the event that the MRO verifies the test negative or cancels it\u2014 (A) You return the employee imme\u00ad diately to the performance of safety-sensitive duties; (B) The employee suffers no adverse personnel or financial consequences as a result; and (C) You maintain no individually identifiable record that the employee had a confirmed laboratory positive, adulterated, or substituted test result (i.e., you maintain a record of the test only as a negative or cancelled test). (d) The Administrator of the con\u00ad cerned DOT agency, or his or her des\u00adignee, may grant a waiver request only if he or she determines that, in the context of your organization, there is a high probability that the procedures you propose will effectively enhance safety and protect the interests of em\u00adployees in fairness and confidentiality. (1) The Administrator, or his or her designee, may impose any conditions he or she deems appropriate on the grant of a waiver. (2) The Administrator, or his or her designee, may immediately suspend or revoke the waiver if he or she deter-mines that you have failed to protect effectively the interests of employees in fairness and confidentiality, that you have failed to comply with the re\u00adquirements of this section, or that you have failed to comply with any other conditions the DOT agency has at\u00adtached to the waiver. (e) You must not stand employees down in the absence of a waiver, or in-consistent with the terms of your waiv\u00ader. If you do, you are in violation of this part and DOT agency drug testing regulations, and you are subject to en\u00adforcement action by the DOT agency just as you are for other violations of this part and DOT agency rules. \u00a7 40.23 What actions do employers take after receiving verified test results? (a) As an employer who receives a verified positive drug test result, you \u00a740.23 must immediately remove the em\u00ad ployee involved from performing safe\u00ad ty-sensitive functions. You must take this action upon receiving the initial report of the verified positive test re\u00ad sult. Do not wait to receive the written report or the result of a split specimen test. (b) As an employer who receives a verified adulterated or substituted drug test result, you must consider this a refusal to test and immediately re- move the employee involved from per- forming safety-sensitive functions. You must take this action on receiving the initial report of the verified adulter\u00ad ated or substituted test result. Do not wait to receive the written report or the result of a split specimen test. (c) As an employer who receives an alcohol test result of 0.04 or higher, you must immediately remove the em\u00ad ployee involved from performing safe\u00ad ty-sensitive functions. If you receive an alcohol test result of 0.02\u20140.39, you must temporarily remove the employee involved from performing safety-sen\u00ad sitive functions, as provided in applica\u00ad ble DOT agency regulations. Do not wait to receive the written report of the result of the test. (d) As an employer, when an em\u00ad ployee has a verified positive, adulter\u00ad ated, or substituted test result, or has otherwise violated a DOT agency drug and alcohol regulation, you must not return the employee to the perform\u00adance of safety-sensitive functions until or unless the employee successfully completes the return-to-duty process of Subpart O of this part. (e) As an employer who receives a drug test result indicating that the em\u00adployee's specimen was dilute, take ac\u00ad tion as provided in \u00a7 40.197. (f) As an employer who receives a drug test result indicating that the em\u00adployee's specimen was invalid and that a second collection must take place under direct observation\u2014 (1) You must immediately direct the employee to provide a new specimen under direct observation. (2) You must not attach con- sequences to the finding that the test was invalid other than collecting a new specimen under direct observation. 587 \u00a740.25 (3) You must not give any advance notice of this test requirement to the employee. (4) You must instruct the collector to note on the CCF the same reason (e.g. random test, post-accident test) as for the original collection. (g) As an employer who receives a cancelled test result when a negative result is required (e.g., pre-employ\u00ad ment, return-to-duty, or follow-up test), you must direct the employee to provide another specimen immediately. (h) As an employer, you may also be required to take additional actions re\u00adquired by DOT agency regulations (e.g., FAA rules require some positive drug tests to be reported to the Federal Air Surgeon). (i) As an employer, you must not alter a drug or alcohol test result transmitted to you by an MRO, BAT, or C/TPA. \u00a7 40.25 Must an employer check on the drug and alcohol testing record of employees it is intending to use to perform safety-sensitive duties? (a) Yes, as an employer, you must, after obtaining an employee's written consent, request the information about the employee listed in paragraph (b) of this section. This requirement applies only to employees seeking to begin performing safety-sensitive duties for you for the first time (i.e., a new hire, an employee transfers into a safety- sensitive position). If the employee re- fuses to provide this written consent, you must not permit the employee to perform safety-sensitive functions. (b) You must request the information listed in this paragraph (b) from DOT-regulated employers who have em\u00ad ployed the employee during any period during the two years before the date of the employee's application or transfer: (1) Alcohol tests with a result of 0.04 or higher alcohol concentration; (2) Verified positive drug tests; (3) Refusals to be tested (including verified adulterated or substituted drug test results); (4) Other violations of DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulations; and (5) With respect to any employee who violated a DOT drug and alcohol regu\u00adlation, documentation of the employ\u00ad ee's successful completion of DOT re-49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) turn-to-duty requirements (including follow-up tests). If the previous em\u00adployer does not have information about the return-do-duty process (e.g., an em\u00ad ployer who did not hire an employee who tested positive on a pre-employ\u00adment test), you must seek to obtain this information from the employee. (c) The information obtained from a previous employer includes any drug or alcohol test information obtained from previous employers under this section or other applicable DOT agency regula\u00adtions. (d) If feasible, you must obtain and review this information before the em\u00adployee first performs safety-sensitive functions. If this is not feasible, you must obtain and review the informa\u00adtion as soon as possible. However, you must not permit the employee to per-form safety-sensitive functions after 30 days from the date on which the em\u00adployee first performed safety-sensitive functions, unless you have obtained or made and documented a good faith ef\u00adfort to obtain this information. (e) If you obtain information that the employee has violated a DOT agency drug and alcohol regulation, you must not use the employee to perform safe\u00adty-sensitive functions unless you also obtain information that the employee has subsequently complied with the re-turn-to-duty requirements of Subpart O of this part and DOT agency drug and alcohol regulations. (f) You must provide to each of the employers from whom you request in-formation under paragraph (b) of this section written consent for the release of the information cited in paragraph (a) of this section. (g) The release of information under this section must be in any written form (e.g., fax, e-mail, letter) that en\u00ad sures confidentiality. As the previous employer, you must maintain a written record of the information released, in\u00adcluding the date, the party to whom it was released, and a summary of the in-formation provided. (h) If you are an employer from whom information is requested under paragraph (b) of this section, you must, after reviewing the employee's specific, written consent, immediately release the requested information to the em\u00adployer making the inquiry. 588 Office of the Secretary of Transportation (i) As the employer requesting the in- formation required under this section, you must maintain a written, confiden\u00ad tial record of the information you ob\u00adtain or of the good faith efforts you made to obtain the information. You must retain this information for three years from the date of the employee's first performance of safety-sensitive duties for you. (j) As the employer, you must also ask the employee whether he or she has tested positive, or refused to test, on any pre-employment drug or alcohol test administered by an employer to which the employee applied for, but did not obtain, safety-sensitive transpor\u00adtation work covered by DOT agency drug and alcohol testing rules during the past two years. If the employee ad\u00admits that he or she had a positive test or a refusal to test, you must not use the employee to perform safety-sen\u00adsitive functions for you, until and un\u00adless the employee documents success\u00adful completion of the return-to-duty process (see paragraphs (b)(5) and (e) of this section). \u00a7 40.27 May an employer require an employee to sign a consent or re- lease in connection with the DOT drug and alcohol testing program? No, as an employer, you must not re- quire an employee to sign a consent, release, waiver of liability, or indem\u00adnification agreement with respect to any part of the drug or alcohol testing process covered by this part (including, but not limited to, collections, labora\u00adtory testing, MRO and SAP services).

(a) Collectors meeting the require\u00ad ments of this subpart are the only per- sons authorized to collect urine speci\u00ad mens for DOT drug testing. (b) A collector must meet training requirements of \u00a7 40.33. (c) As the immediate supervisor of an employee being tested, you may not 589 \u00a740.33 act as the collector when that em\u00ad ployee is tested, unless no other col\u00adlector is available and you are per\u00admitted to do so under DOT agency drug and alcohol regulations. (d) You must not act as the collector for the employee being tested if you work for a HHS-certified laboratory (e.g., as a technician or accessioner) and could link the employee with a urine specimen, drug testing result, or laboratory report. \u00a7 40.33 What training requirements must a collector meet? To be permitted to act as a collector in the DOT drug testing program, you must meet each of the requirements of this section: (a) Basic information. You must be knowledgeable about this part, the cur-rent ''DOT Urine Specimen Collection Procedures Guidelines,'' and DOT agen\u00adcy regulations applicable to the em\u00adployers for whom you perform collec\u00adtions, and you must keep current on any changes to these materials. The DOT Urine Specimen Collection Proce\u00addures Guidelines document is available from ODAPC (Department of Transpor\u00adtation, 400 7th Street, SW., Room 10403, Washington DC, 20590, 202-366-3784, or on the ODAPC web site (http:// www.dot.gov/ost/dapc). (b) Qualification training. You must receive qualification training meeting the requirements of this paragraph. Qualification training must provide in\u00adstruction on the following subjects: (1) All steps necessary to complete a collection correctly and the proper completion and transmission of the CCF; (2) ''Problem'' collections (e.g., situa\u00ad tions like ''shy bladder'' and attempts to tamper with a specimen); (3) Fatal flaws, correctable flaws, and how to correct problems in collections; and (4) The collector's responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the collec\u00adtion process, ensuring the privacy of employees being tested, ensuring the security of the specimen, and avoiding conduct or statements that could be viewed as offensive or inappropriate; (c) Initial Proficiency Demonstration. Following your completion of quali\u00adfication training under paragraph (b) of 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) this section, you must demonstrate proficiency in collections under this part by completing five consecutive error-free mock collections. (1) The five mock collections must include two uneventful collection sce\u00ad narios, one insufficient quantity of urine scenario, one temperature out of range scenario, and one scenario in which the employee refuses to sign the CCF and initial the specimen bottle tamper-evident seal. (2) Another person must monitor and evaluate your performance, in person or by a means that provides real-time observation and interaction between the instructor and trainee, and attest in writing that the mock collections are ''error-free.'' This person must be a qualified collector who has dem\u00adonstrated necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities by\u2014 (i) Regularly conducting DOT drug test collections for a period of at least a year; (ii) Conducting collector training under this part for a year; or (iii) Successfully completing a ''train the trainer'' course. (d) Schedule for qualification training and initial proficiency demonstration. The following is the schedule for quali\u00ad fication training and the initial pro\u00ad ficiency demonstration you must meet: (1) If you became a collector before August 1, 2001, and you have already met the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, you do not have to meet them again. (2) If you became a collector before August 1, 2001, and have yet to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, you must do so no later than January 31, 2003. (3) If you become a collector on or after August 1, 2001, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section before you begin to per- form collector functions. (e) Refresher training. No less fre\u00ad quently than every five years from the date on which you satisfactorily com\u00ad plete the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, you must complete refresher training that meets all the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. 590 Office of the Secretary of Transportation (f) Error Correction Training. If you make a mistake in the collection proc\u00ad ess that causes a test to be cancelled (i.e., a fatal or uncorrected flaw), you must undergo error correction train\u00ad ing. This training must occur within 30 days of the date you are notified of the error that led to the need for retrain\u00ading. (1) Error correction training must be provided and your proficiency docu\u00ad mented in writing by a person who meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. (2) Error correction training is re\u00ad quired to cover only the subject matter area(s) in which the error that caused the test to be cancelled occurred. (3) As part of the error correction training, you must demonstrate your proficiency in the collection proce\u00ad dures of this part by completing three consecutive error-free mock collec\u00ad tions. The mock collections must in\u00ad clude one uneventful scenario and two scenarios related to the area(s) in which your error(s) occurred. The per- son providing the training must mon\u00ad itor and evaluate your performance and attest in writing that the mock collections were ''error-free.'' (g) Documentation. You must main\u00ad tain documentation showing that you currently meet all requirements of this section. You must provide this docu\u00ad mentation on request to DOT agency representatives and to employers and C/TPAs who are using or negotiating to use your services.

As an employer, you must provide to collectors the name and telephone number of the appropriate DER (and C/ TPA, where applicable) to contact about any problems or issues that may arise during the testing process. \u00a7 40.37 Where is other information on the role of collectors found in this regulation? You can find other information on the role and functions of collectors in the following sections of this part: \u00a740.3\u2014Definition. \u00a740.41 \u00a7 CCF. 40.67\u2014Role collections. \u00a7 40.69\u2014Role in monitored collections. \u00a7 40.71\u2014Role in split specimen collections. \u00a7 40.73\u2014Chain of custody completion and fin\u00ad ishing the collection process. \u00a7 40.103\u2014Processing blind specimens. \u00a7 in case 40.199-40.205\u2014Collector fects, and means of correction. Subpart D\u2014Collection Sites, Forms, Equipment and Sup- plies Used in DOT Urine Col\u00adlections \u00a7 40.41 Where does a urine collection for a DOT drug test take place? (a) A urine collection for a DOT drug test must take place in a collection site meeting the requirements of this section. (b) If you are operating a collection site, you must ensure that it meets the security requirements of \u00a7 40.43. (c) If you are operating a collection site, you must have all necessary per\u00adsonnel, materials, equipment, facilities and supervision to provide for the col\u00adlection, temporary storage, and ship-ping of urine specimens to a labora\u00adtory, and a suitable clean surface for writing. (d) Your collection site must include a facility for urination described in ei\u00adther paragraph (e) or paragraph (f) of this section. (e) The first, and preferred, type of facility for urination that a collection site may include is a single-toilet room, having a full-length privacy door, within which urination can occur. (1) No one but the employee may be present in the room during the collec\u00adtion, except for the observer in the event of a directly observed collection. (2) You must have a source of water for washing hands, that, if practicable, should be external to the closed room where urination occurs. If an external 591 \u00a740.43 source is not available, you may meet this requirement by securing all sources of water and other substances that could be used for adulteration and substitution (e.g., water faucets, soap dispensers) and providing moist towelettes outside the closed room. (f) The second type of facility for uri\u00ad nation that a collection site may in\u00ad clude is a multistall restroom. (1) Such a site must provide substan\u00ad tial visual privacy (e.g., a toilet stall with a partial-length door) and meet all other applicable requirements of this section. (2) If you use a multi-stall restroom, you must either\u2014 (i) Secure all sources of water and other substances that could be used for adulteration and substitution (e.g., water faucets, soap dispensers) and place bluing agent in all toilets or se\u00adcure the toilets to prevent access; or (ii) Conduct all collections in the fa\u00ad cility as monitored collections (see \u00a7 40.69 for procedures). This is the only circumstance in which you may con-duct a monitored collection. (3) No one but the employee may be present in the multistall restroom dur\u00ading the collection, except for the mon\u00aditor in the event of a monitored collec\u00adtion or the observer in the event of a directly observed collection. (g) A collection site may be in a med\u00ad ical facility, a mobile facility (e.g., a van), a dedicated collection facility, or any other location meeting the re\u00adquirements of this section. \u00a7 40.43 What steps must operators of collection sites take to protect the security and integrity of urine col\u00adlections? (a) Collectors and operators of collec\u00ad tion sites must take the steps listed in this section to prevent unauthorized access that could compromise the in\u00adtegrity of collections. (b) As a collector, you must do the following before each collection to deter tampering with specimens: (1) Secure any water sources or oth\u00ad erwise make them unavailable to em\u00adployees (e.g., turn off water inlet, tape handles to prevent opening faucets); (2) Ensure that the water in the toi\u00ad let is blue; 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) (3) Ensure that no soap, disinfect- ants, cleaning agents, or other possible adulterants are present; (4) Inspect the site to ensure that no foreign or unauthorized substances are present; (5) Tape or otherwise secure shut any movable toilet tank top, or put bluing in the tank; (6) Ensure that undetected access (e.g., through a door not in your view) is not possible; (7) Secure areas and items (e.g., ledges, trash receptacles, paper towel holders, under-sink areas) that appear suitable for concealing contaminants; and (8) Recheck items in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section fol\u00adlowing each collection to ensure the site's continued integrity. (c) If the collection site uses a facil\u00ad ity normally used for other purposes, like a public rest room or hospital ex\u00adamining room, you must, as a col\u00adlector, also ensure before the collection that: (1) Access to collection materials and specimens is effectively restricted; and (2) The facility is secured against ac\u00ad cess during the procedure to ensure pri\u00advacy to the employee and prevent dis\u00adtraction of the collector. Limited-ac\u00adcess signs must be posted. (d) As a collector, you must take the following additional steps to ensure se\u00adcurity during the collection process: (1) To avoid distraction that could compromise security, you are limited to conducting a collection for only one employee at a time. However, during the time one employee is in the period for drinking fluids in a ''shy bladder'' situation (see \u00a7 40.193(b)), you may con- duct a collection for another employee. (2) To the greatest extent you can, keep an employee's collection con\u00adtainer within view of both you and the employee between the time the em\u00adployee has urinated and the specimen is sealed. (3) Ensure you are the only person in addition to the employee who handles the specimen before it is poured into the bottles and sealed with tamper-evi\u00addent seals. (4) In the time between when the em\u00ad ployee gives you the specimen and 592 Office of the Secretary of Transportation when you seal the specimen, remain within the collection site. (5) Maintain personal control over each specimen and CCF throughout the collection process. (e) If you are operating a collection site, you must implement a policy and procedures to prevent unauthorized personnel from entering any part of the site in which urine specimens are col\u00adlected or stored. (1) Only employees being tested, col\u00ad lectors and other collection site work\u00aders, DERs, employee and employer rep\u00adresentatives authorized by the em\u00adployer (e.g., employer policy, collective bargaining agreement), and DOT agen\u00adcy representatives are authorized per-sons for purposes of this paragraph (e). (2) Except for the observer in a di\u00ad rectly observed collection or the mon\u00aditor in the case of a monitored collec\u00adtion, you must not permit anyone to enter the urination facility in which employees provide specimens. (3) You must ensure that all author\u00ad ized persons are under the supervision of a collector at all times when per\u00admitted into the site. (4) You or the collector may remove any person who obstructs, interferes with, or causes a delay in the collec\u00adtion process. (f) If you are operating a collection site, you must minimize the number of persons handling specimens. \u00a7 40.45 What form is used to document a DOT urine collection? (a) The Federal Drug Testing Cus\u00ad tody and Control Form (CCF) must be used to document every urine collec\u00adtion required by the DOT drug testing program. The CCF must be a five-part carbonless manifold form. You may view this form on the Department's web site (http:// www.workplace.samhsa.gov) or the HHS web site (http://www.health.org/ workpl.htm). (b) You must not use a non-Federal form or an expired Federal form to con-duct a DOT urine collection. As a lab-oratory, C/TPA or other party that pro\u00advides CCFs to employers, collection sites, or other customers, you must not provide copies of an expired Federal form to these participants. You must also affirmatively notify these partici-\u00a740.45 pants that they must not use an ex\u00adpired Federal form (e.g., that beginning August 1, 2001, they may not use the old 7-part Federal CCF for DOT urine collections). (c) As a participant in the DOT drug testing program, you are not permitted to modify or revise the CCF except as follows: (1) You may include, in the area out- side the border of the form, other infor\u00admation needed for billing or other pur\u00adposes necessary to the collection proc\u00adess. (2) The CCF must include the names, addresses, telephone numbers and fax numbers of the employer and the MRO, which may be preprinted, typed, or handwritten. The MRO information must include the specific physician's name and address, as opposed to only a generic clinic, health care organiza\u00adtion, or company name. This informa\u00adtion is required, and it is prohibited for an employer, collector, service agent or any other party to omit it. In addi\u00adtion, a C/TPA's name, address, fax number, and telephone number may be included, but is not required. The em\u00adployer may use a C/TPA's address in place of its own, but must continue to include its name, telephone number, and fax number. (3) As an employer, you may add the name of the DOT agency under whose authority the test occurred as part of the employer information. (4) As a collector, you may use a CCF with your name, address, telephone number, and fax number preprinted, but under no circumstances may you sign the form before the collection event. (d) Under no circumstances may the CCF transmit personal identifying in-formation about an employee (other than a social security number (SSN) or other employee identification (ID) number) to a laboratory. (e) As an employer, you may use an equivalent foreign-language version of the CCF approved by ODAPC. You may use such a non-English language form only in a situation where both the em\u00adployee and collector understand and can use the form in that language. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended Aug. 9, 2001] 593 collections or non-Fed\u00ad eral forms for DOT collections? (a) No, as an employer, you are pro\u00ad hibited from using the CCF for non- Federal urine collections. You are also prohibited from using non-Federal forms for DOT urine collections. Doing either subjects you to enforcement ac\u00ad tion under DOT agency regulations. (b) (1) In the rare case where the col\u00ad lector, either by mistake or as the only means to conduct a test under difficult circumstances (e.g., post-accident or reasonable suspicion test with insuffi\u00ad cient time to obtain the CCF), uses a non-Federal form for a DOT collection, the use of a non-Federal form does not present a reason for the laboratory to reject the specimen for testing or for an MRO to cancel the result. (2) The use of the non-Federal form is a ''correctable flaw.'' As an MRO, to correct the problem you must follow the procedures of \u00a7 40.205(b)(2). [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, FR 41950, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.49 What materials are used to col\u00ad lect urine specimens? For each DOT drug test, you must use a collection kit meeting the re\u00ad quirements of Appendix A of this part. \u00a7 40.51 What materials are used to send urine specimens to the labora\u00ad tory? (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, you must use a ship- ping container that adequately pro\u00adtects the specimen bottles from ship\u00adment damage in the transport of speci\u00admens from the collection site to the laboratory. (b) You are not required to use a shipping container if a laboratory cou\u00adrier hand-delivers the specimens from the collection site to the laboratory. Subpart E\u2014Urine Specimen Collections \u00a7 40.61 What are the preliminary steps in the collection process? As the collector, you must take the following steps before actually begin\u00adning a collection: 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) (a) When a specific time for an em\u00ad ployee's test has been scheduled, or the collection site is at the employee's work site, and the employee does not appear at the collection site at the scheduled time, contact the DER to de\u00adtermine the appropriate interval with- in which the DER has determined the employee is authorized to arrive. If the employee's arrival is delayed beyond that time, you must notify the DER that the employee has not reported for testing. In a situation where a C/TPA has notified an owner/operator or other individual employee to report for test\u00ad ing and the employee does not appear, the C/TPA must notify the employee that he or she has refused to test (see \u00a740.191(a)(1)). (b) Ensure that, when the employee enters the collection site, you begin the testing process without undue delay. For example, you must not wait because the employee says he or she is not ready or is unable to urinate or be- cause an authorized employer or em\u00adployee representative is delayed in ar\u00adriving. (1) If the employee is also going to take a DOT alcohol test, you must, to the greatest extent practicable, ensure that the alcohol test is completed be-fore the urine collection process be- gins. Example to Paragraph (b)(1): An employee enters the test site for both a drug and an al\u00ad cohol test. Normally, the collector would wait until the BAT had completed the alco\u00ad hol test process before beginning the drug test process. However, there are some situa\u00ad tions in which an exception to this normal practice would be reasonable. One such situ\u00ad ation might be if several people were waiting for the BAT to conduct alcohol tests, but a drug testing collector in the same facility were free. Someone waiting might be able to complete a drug test without unduly delay\u00ad ing his or her alcohol test. Collectors and BATs should work together, however, to en- sure that post-accident and reasonable sus\u00ad picion alcohol tests happen as soon as pos\u00ad sible (e.g., by moving the employee to the head of the line for alcohol tests). (2) If the employee needs medical at\u00ad tention (e.g., an injured employee in an emergency medical facility who is re\u00ad quired to have a post-accident test), do not delay this treatment to collect a specimen. 594 Office of the Secretary of Transportation (3) You must not collect, by catheter\u00ad ization or other means, urine from an unconscious employee to conduct a drug test under this part. Nor may you catheterize a conscious employee. How-ever, you must inform an employee who normally voids through self-cath\u00adeterization that the employee is re\u00adquired to provide a specimen in that manner. (4) If, as an employee, you normally void through self-catheterization, and decline to do so, this constitutes a re\u00adfusal to test. (c) Require the employee to provide positive identification. You must see a photo ID issued by the employer (other than in the case of an owner-operator or other self-employed individual) or a Federal, state, or local government (e.g., a driver's license). You may not accept faxes or photocopies of identi\u00adfication. Positive identification by an employer representative (not a co-worker or another employee being test\u00aded) is also acceptable. If the employee cannot produce positive identification, you must contact a DER to verify the identity of the employee. (d) If the employee asks, provide your identification to the employee. Your identification must include your name and your employer's name, but does not have to include your picture, ad-dress, or telephone number. (e) Explain the basic collection pro\u00ad cedure to the employee, including showing the employee the instructions on the back of the CCF. (f) Direct the employee to remove outer clothing (e.g., coveralls, jacket, coat, hat) that could be used to conceal items or substances that could be used to tamper with a specimen. You must also direct the employee to leave these garments and any briefcase, purse, or other personal belongings with you or in a mutually agreeable location. You must advise the employee that failure to comply with your directions con\u00adstitutes a refusal to test. (1) If the employee asks for a receipt for any belongings left with you, you must provide one. (2) You must allow the employee to keep his or her wallet. (3) You must not ask the employee to remove other clothing (e.g., shirts, pants, dresses, underwear), to remove \u00a740.63 all clothing, or to change into a hos\u00adpital or examination gown (unless the urine collection is being accomplished simultaneously with a DOT agency-au\u00adthorized medical examination). (4) You must direct the employee to empty his or her pockets and display the items in them to ensure that no items are present which could be used to adulterate the specimen. If nothing is there that can be used to adulterate a specimen, the employee can place the items back into his or her pockets. As the employee, you must allow the col\u00adlector to make this observation. (5) If, in your duties under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, you find any ma\u00adterial that could be used to tamper with a specimen, you must: (i) Determine if the material appears to be brought to the collection site with the intent to alter the specimen, and, if it is, conduct a directly ob\u00adserved collection using direct observa\u00adtion procedures (see \u00a7 40.67); or (ii) Determine if the material appears to be inadvertently brought to the col\u00adlection site (e.g., eye drops), secure and maintain it until the collection process is completed and conduct a normal (i.e., unobserved) collection. (g) You must instruct the employee not to list medications that he or she is currently taking on the CCF. (The employee may make notes of medica\u00adtions on the back of the employee copy of the form for his or her own conven\u00adience, but these notes must not be transmitted to anyone else.) \u00a7 40.63 What steps does the collector take in the collection process before the employee provides a urine spec\u00adimen? As the collector, you must take the following steps before the employee provides the urine specimen: (a) Complete Step 1 of the CCF. (b) Instruct the employee to wash and dry his or her hands at this time. You must tell the employee not to wash his or her hands again until after delivering the specimen to you. You must not give the employee any fur\u00adther access to water or other materials that could be used to adulterate or di\u00adlute a specimen. (c) Select, or allow the employee to select, an individually wrapped or 595 \u00a740.65 sealed collection container from collec\u00ad tion kit materials. Either you or the employee, with both of you present, must unwrap or break the seal of the collection container. You must not un\u00ad wrap or break the seal on any specimen bottle at this time. You must not allow the employee to take anything from the collection kit into the room used for urination except the collection con\u00ad tainer. (d) Direct the employee to go into the room used for urination, provide a specimen of at least 45 mL, not flush the toilet, and return to you with the specimen as soon as the employee has completed the void. (1) Except in the case of an observed or a monitored collection (see \u00a7\u00a7 40.67 and 40.69 ), neither you nor anyone else may go into the room with the em\u00adployee. (2) As the collector, you may set a reasonable time limit for voiding. (e) You must pay careful attention to the employee during the entire collec\u00ad tion process to note any conduct that clearly indicates an attempt to tamper with a specimen (e.g., substitute urine in plain view or an attempt to bring into the collection site an adulterant or urine substitute). If you detect such conduct, you must require that a col\u00ad lection take place immediately under direct observation (see \u00a7 40.67 ) and note the conduct and the fact that the col\u00adlection was observed in the ''Remarks'' line of the CCF (Step 2). You must also, as soon as possible, inform the DER and collection site supervisor that a collection took place under direct ob\u00adservation and the reason for doing so. \u00a7 40.65 What does the collector check for when the employee presents a specimen? As a collector, you must check the following when the employee gives the collection container to you: (a) Sufficiency of specimen. You must check to ensure that the specimen con\u00adtains at least 45 mL of urine. (1) If it does not, you must follow ''shy bladder'' procedures (see \u00a740.193(b)). (2) When you follow ''shy bladder'' procedures, you must discard the origi\u00adnal specimen, unless another problem 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) (i.e., temperature out of range, signs of tampering) also exists. (3) You are never permitted to com\u00ad bine urine collected from separate voids to create a specimen. (4) You must discard any excess urine. (b) Temperature. You must check the temperature of the specimen no later than four minutes after the employee has given you the specimen. (1) The acceptable temperature range is 32-38 \u00b0C/90-100 \u00b0F. (2) You must determine the tempera\u00ad ture of the specimen by reading the temperature strip attached to the col\u00adlection container. (3) If the specimen temperature is within the acceptable range, you must mark the ''Yes'' box on the CCF (Step 2). (4) If the specimen temperature is outside the acceptable range, you must mark the ''No'' box and enter in the ''Remarks'' line (Step 2) your findings about the temperature. (5) If the specimen temperature is outside the acceptable range, you must immediately conduct a new collection using direct observation procedures (see \u00a7 40.67). (6) In a case where a specimen is col\u00ad lected under direct observation because of the temperature being out of range, you must process both the original specimen and the specimen collected using direct observation and send the two sets of specimens to the labora\u00adtory. This is true even in a case in which the original specimen has insuf\u00adficient volume but the temperature is out of range. You must also, as soon as possible, inform the DER and collec\u00adtion site supervisor that a collection took place under direct observation and the reason for doing so. (7) In a case where the employee re- fuses to provide another specimen (see \u00a7 40.191(a)(3)) or refuses to provide an- other specimen under direct observa\u00adtion (see \u00a7 40.191(a)(4)), you must notify the DER. As soon as you have notified the DER, you must discard any speci\u00admen the employee has provided pre\u00adviously during the collection proce\u00addure. (c) Signs of tampering. You must in\u00ad spect the specimen for unusual color, presence of foreign objects or material, 596 Office of the Secretary of Transportation or other signs of tampering (e.g., if you notice any unusual odor). (1) If it is apparent from this inspec\u00ad tion that the employee has tampered with the specimen (e.g., blue dye in the specimen, excessive foaming when shaken, smell of bleach), you must im\u00admediately conduct a new collection using direct observation procedures (see \u00a7 40.67 ). (2) In a case where a specimen is col\u00ad lected under direct observation because of showing signs of tampering, you must process both the original speci\u00admen and the specimen collected using direct observation and send the two sets of specimens to the laboratory. This is true even in a case in which the original specimen has insufficient vol\u00adume but it shows signs of tampering. You must also, as soon as possible, in-form the DER and collection site su\u00adpervisor that a collection took place under direct observation and the rea\u00adson for doing so. (3) In a case where the employee re- fuses to provide a specimen under di\u00adrect observation (see \u00a7 40.191(a)(4)), you must discard any specimen the em\u00adployee provided previously during the collection procedure. Then you must notify the DER as soon as practicable. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as FR 41950, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.67 When and how is a directly ob\u00ad served collection conducted? (a) As an employer you must direct an immediate collection under direct observation with no advance notice to the employee, if: (1) The laboratory reported to the MRO that a specimen is invalid, and the MRO reported to you that there was not an adequate medical expla\u00adnation for the result; or (2) The MRO reported to you that the original positive, adulterated, or sub\u00adstituted test result had to be cancelled because the test of the split specimen could not be performed. (b) As an employer, you may direct a collection under direct observation of an employee if the drug test is a re-turn-to-duty test or a follow-up test. (c) As a collector, you must imme\u00ad diately conduct a collection under di\u00adrect observation if: \u00a740.67 (1) You are directed by the DER to do so (see paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section); or (2) You observed materials brought to the collection site or the employee's conduct clearly indicates an attempt to tamper with a specimen (see \u00a7\u00a7 40.61(f)(5)(i) and 40.63(e)); or (3) The temperature on the original specimen was out of range (see \u00a7 40.65(b)(5)); or (4) The original speci\u00ad men appeared to have been tampered with (see \u00a7 40.65(c)(1)). (d)(1) As the employer, you must ex- plain to the employee the reason for a directly observed collection under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. (2) As the collector, you must explain to the employee the reason, if known, under this part for a directly observed collection under paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section. (e) As the collector, you must com\u00ad plete a new CCF for the directly ob\u00adserved collection. (1) You must mark the ''reason for test'' block (Step 1) the same as for the first collection. (2) You must check the ''Observed, (Enter Remark)'' box and enter the reason (see \u00a7 40.67(b)) in the ''Remarks'' line (Step 2). (f) In a case where two sets of speci\u00ad mens are being sent to the laboratory because of suspected tampering with the specimen at the collection site, enter on the ''Remarks'' line of the CCF (Step 2) for each specimen a nota\u00adtion to this effect (e.g., collection 1 of 2, or 2 of 2) and the specimen ID num\u00adber of the other specimen. (g) As the collector, you must ensure that the observer is the same gender as the employee. You must never permit an opposite gender person to act as the observer. The observer can be a dif\u00adferent person from the collector and need not be a qualified collector. (h) As the collector, if someone else is to observe the collection (e.g., in order to ensure a same gender ob\u00adserver), you must verbally instruct that person to follow procedures at paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section. If you, the collector, are the observer, you too must follow these procedures. (i) As the observer, you must watch the employee urinate into the collec\u00adtion container. Specifically, you are to 597 \u00a740.69 watch the urine go from the employee's body into the collection container. (j) As the observer but not the col\u00ad lector, you must not take the collec\u00ad tion container from the employee, but you must observe the specimen as the employee takes it to the collector. (k) As the collector, when someone else has acted as the observer, you must include the observer's name in the ''Remarks'' line of the CCF (Step 2). (l) As the employee, if you decline to allow a directly observed collection re\u00ad quired or permitted under this section to occur, this is a refusal to test. (m) As the collector, when you learn that a directly observed collection should have been collected but was not, you must inform the employer that it must direct the employee to have an immediate recollection under direct observation. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41950, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.69 How is a monitored collection conducted? (a) As the collector, you must secure the room being used for the monitored collection so that no one except the employee and the monitor can enter it until after the collection has been com\u00adpleted. (b) As the collector, you must ensure that the monitor is the same gender as the employee, unless the monitor is a medical professional (e.g., nurse, doc-tor, physician's assistant, technologist, or technician licensed or certified to practice in the jurisdiction in which the collection takes place). The mon\u00aditor can be a different person from the collector and need not be a qualified collector. (c) As the collector, if someone else is to monitor the collection (e.g., in order to ensure a same-gender mon\u00aditor), you must verbally instruct that person to follow the procedures of para-graphs (d) and (e) of this section. If you, the collector, are the monitor, you must follow these procedures. (d) As the monitor, you must not watch the employee urinate into the collection container. If you hear sounds or make other observations in\u00addicating an attempt to tamper with a specimen, there must be an additional 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) collection under direct observation (see \u00a7\u00a7 40.63(e), 40.65(c), and 40.67(b)). (e) As the monitor, you must ensure that the employee takes the collection container directly to the collector as soon as the employee has exited the en-closure. (f) As the collector, when someone else has acted as the monitor, you must note that person's name in the ''Remarks'' line of the CCF (Step 2). (g) As the employee being tested, if you decline to permit a collection au\u00adthorized under this section to be mon\u00aditored, it is a refusal to test. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41951, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.71 How does the collector prepare the specimens? (a) All collections under DOT agency drug testing regulations must be split specimen collections. (b) As the collector, you must take the following steps, in order, after the employee brings the urine specimen to you. You must take these steps in the presence of the employee. (1) Check the box on the CCF (Step 2) indicating that this was a split speci\u00admen collection. (2) You, not the employee, must first pour at least 30 mL of urine from the collection container into one specimen bottle, to be used for the primary spec\u00adimen. (3) You, not the employee, must then pour at least 15 mL of urine from the collection container into the second specimen bottle to be used for the split specimen. (4) You, not the employee, must place and secure (i.e., tighten or snap) the lids/caps on the bottles. (5) You, not the employee, must seal the bottles by placing the tamper-evi\u00addent bottle seals over the bottle caps/ lids and down the sides of the bottles. (6) You, not the employee, must then write the date on the tamper-evident bottle seals. (7) You must then ensure that the employee initials the tamper-evident bottle seals for the purpose of certi\u00adfying that the bottles contain the specimens he or she provided. If the employee fails or refuses to do so, you must note this in the ''Remarks'' line 598 Office of the Secretary of Transportation of the CCF (Step 2) and complete the collection process. (8) You must discard any urine left over in the collection container after both specimen bottles have been appro\u00adpriately filled and sealed. There is one exception to this requirement: you may use excess urine to conduct clin\u00adical tests (e.g., protein, glucose) if the collection was conducted in conjunc\u00adtion with a physical examination re\u00adquired by a DOT agency regulation. Neither you nor anyone else may con-duct further testing (such as adultera\u00adtion testing) on this excess urine and the employee has no legal right to de\u00admand that the excess urine be turned over to the employee. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41951, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.73 How is the collection process completed? (a) As the collector, you must do the following things to complete the col\u00ad lection process. You must complete the steps called for in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section in the em\u00adployee's presence. (1) Direct the employee to read and sign the certification statement on Copy 2 (Step 5) of the CCF and provide date of birth, printed name, and day and evening contact telephone num\u00adbers. If the employee refuses to sign the CCF or to provide date of birth, printed name, or telephone numbers, you must note this in the ''Remarks'' line (Step 2) of the CCF, and complete the collection. If the employee refuses to fill out any information, you must, as a minimum, print the employee's name in the appropriate place. (2) Complete the chain of custody on the CCF (Step 5) by printing your name (note: you may pre-print your name), recording the time and date of the col\u00adlection, signing the statement, and en\u00adtering the name of the delivery service transferring the specimen to the lab-oratory, (3) Ensure that all copies of the CCF are legible and complete. (4) Remove Copy 5 of the CCF and give it to the employee. (5) Place the specimen bottles and Copy 1 of the CCF in the appropriate pouches of the plastic bag. \u00a740.81 (6) Secure both pouches of the plastic bag. (7) Advise the employee that he or she may leave the collection site. (8) To prepare the sealed plastic bag containing the specimens and CCF for shipment you must: (i) Place the sealed plastic bag in a shipping container (e.g., standard cou\u00ad rier box) designed to minimize the pos\u00ad sibility of damage during shipment. (More than one sealed plastic bag can be placed into a single shipping con\u00adtainer if you are doing multiple collec\u00ad tions.) (ii) Seal the container as appropriate. (iii) If a laboratory courier hand-de- livers the specimens from the collec\u00ad tion site to the laboratory, prepare the sealed plastic bag for shipment as di\u00ad rected by the courier service. (9) Send Copy 2 of the CCF to the MRO and Copy 4 to the DER. You must fax or otherwise transmit these copies to the MRO and DER within 24 hours or during the next business day. Keep Copy 3 for at least 30 days, unless oth\u00ad erwise specified by applicable DOT agency regulations. (b) As a collector or collection site, you must ensure that each specimen you collect is shipped to a laboratory as quickly as possible, but in any case within 24 hours or during the next busi\u00ad ness day. Subpart F\u2014Drug Testing Laboratories \u00a7 40.81 What laboratories may be used for DOT drug testing? (a) As a drug testing laboratory lo\u00ad cated in the U.S., you are permitted to participate in DOT drug testing only if you are certified by HHS under the Na\u00adtional Laboratory Certification Pro- gram (NLCP) for all testing required under this part. (b) As a drug testing laboratory lo\u00ad cated in Canada or Mexico which is not certified by HHS under the NLCP, you are permitted to participate in DOT drug testing only if: (1) The DOT, based on a written rec\u00ad ommendation from HHS, has approved your laboratory as meeting HHS lab- oratory certification standards or 599 \u00a740.83 deemed your laboratory fully equiva\u00ad lent to a laboratory meeting HHS lab-oratory certification standards for all testing required under this part; or (2) The DOT, based on a written rec\u00ad ommendation from HHS, has recog\u00adnized a Canadian or Mexican certifying organization as having equivalent lab-oratory certification standards and procedures to those of HHS, and the Canadian or Mexican certifying organi\u00adzation has certified your laboratory under those equivalent standards and procedures. (c) As a laboratory participating in the DOT drug testing program, you must comply with the requirements of this part. You must also comply with all applicable requirements of HHS in testing DOT specimens, whether or not the HHS requirements are explicitly stated in this part. (d) If DOT determines that you are in noncompliance with this part, you could be subject to PIE proceedings under Subpart R of this part. If the De\u00adpartment issues a PIE with respect to you, you are ineligible to participate in the DOT drug testing program even if you continue to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. \u00a7 40.83 How do laboratories process in- coming specimens? As the laboratory, you must do the following when you receive a DOT spec\u00adimen: (a) You are authorized to receive only the laboratory copy of the CCF. You are not authorized to receive other copies of the CCF nor any copies of the alcohol testing form. (b) You must comply with applicable provisions of the HHS Guidelines con\u00adcerning accessioning and processing urine drug specimens. (c) You must inspect each specimen and CCF for the following ''fatal flaws:'' (1) The specimen ID numbers on the specimen bottle and the CCF do not match; (2) The specimen bottle seal is broken or shows evidence of tampering, unless a split specimen can be redesignated (see paragraph (g) of this section); (3) The collector's printed name and signature are omitted from the CCF; and 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) (4) There is an insufficient amount of urine in the primary bottle for anal\u00adysis, unless the specimens can be redes\u00adignated (see paragraph (g) of this sec\u00adtion). (d) When you find a specimen meet\u00ad ing the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section, you must document your find\u00adings and stop the testing process. Re-port the result in accordance with \u00a7 40.97(a)(3) . (e) You must inspect each CCF for the presence of the collector's signa\u00adture on the certification statement in Step 4 of the CCF. Upon finding that the signature is omitted, document the flaw and continue the testing process. (1) In such a case, you must retain the specimen for a minimum of 5 busi\u00adness days from the date on which you initiated action to correct the flaw. (2) You must then attempt to correct the flaw by following the procedures of \u00a740.205(b)(1). (3) If the flaw is not corrected, report the result as rejected for testing in ac\u00adcordance with \u00a7 40.97(a)(3). (f) If you determine that the speci\u00ad men temperature was not checked and the ''Remarks'' line did not contain an entry regarding the temperature being outside of range, you must then at-tempt to correct the problem by fol\u00adlowing the procedures of \u00a7 40.208. (1) In such a case, you must continue your efforts to correct the problem for five business days, before you report the result. (2) When you have obtained the cor\u00ad rection, or five business days have elapsed, report the result in accordance with \u00a7 40.97(a). (g) If you determine that a CCF that fails to meet the requirements of \u00a7 40.45(a) (e.g., a non-Federal form or an expired Federal form was used for the collection), you must attempt to cor\u00adrect the use of the improper form by following the procedures of \u00a740.205(b)(2). (1) In such a case, you must retain the specimen for a minimum of 5 busi\u00adness days from the date on which you initiated action to correct the problem. (2) During the period August 1-Octo- ber 31, 2001, you are not required to re\u00adject a test conducted on an expired Federal CCF because this problem is not corrected. Beginning November 1, 600 Office of the Secretary of Transportation 2001, if the problem(s) is not corrected, you must reject the test and report the result in accordance with \u00a7 40.97(a)(3). (h) If the CCF is marked indicating that a split specimen collection was collected and if the split specimen does not accompany the primary, has leaked, or is otherwise unavailable for testing, you must still test the primary specimen and follow appropriate proce\u00addures outlined in \u00a7 40.175(b) regarding the unavailability of the split specimen for testing. (1) The primary specimen and the split specimen can be redesignated (i.e., Bottle B is redesignated as Bottle A, and vice-versa) if: (i) The primary specimen appears to have leaked out of its sealed bottle and the laboratory believes a sufficient amount of urine exists in the split specimen to conduct all appropriate primary laboratory testing; or (ii) The primary specimen is labeled as Bottle B, and the split specimen as Bottle A; or (iii) The laboratory opens the split specimen instead of the primary speci\u00admen, the primary specimen remains sealed, and the laboratory believes a sufficient amount of urine exists in the split specimen to conduct all appro\u00adpriate primary laboratory testing; or (iv) The primary specimen seal is broken but the split specimen remains sealed and the laboratory believes a sufficient amount of urine exists in the split specimen to conduct all appro\u00adpriate primary laboratory testing. \u00a740.87 (2) In situations outlined in para- graph (g)(1) of this section, the labora\u00adtory shall mark through the ''A'' and write ''B,'' then initial and date the change. A corresponding change shall be made to the other bottle by marking through the ''B'' and writing ''A,'' and initialing and dating the change. (i) A notation shall be made on Copy 1 of the CCF (Step 5a) and on any lab-oratory internal chain of custody docu\u00adments, as appropriate, for any fatal or correctable flaw. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as 66 FR 41951, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.85 What drugs do laboratories test for? As a laboratory, you must test for the following five drugs or classes of drugs in a DOT drug test. You must not test ''DOT specimens'' for any other drugs. (a) Marijuana metabolites. concentra\u00ad tions for initial and confirmation tests? (a) As a laboratory, you must use the cutoff concentrations displayed in the following table for initial and con\u00adfirmation drug tests. All cutoff con\u00adcentrations are expressed in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). The table fol\u00adlows: Type of drug or metabolite Initial test Confirmation test (1) Marijuana metabolites ................................................ (i) (THC). 50 15 Phencyclidine (PCP) .................... 500 (ii) Methamphetamine ...................................................... .................... 500 (Specimen must also contain a mphetamine at a concentration of greater than or equal to 200 ng/mL.) (5) Opiate metabolites .......................................... .................... 10 (Test for 6 -AM in the specimen. Conduct this test only when specimen contains morphine at a con\u00ad centration greater than or equal to 2000 ng/mL.) acid Delta-9-tetrahydrocanna-binol-9-carboxylic (b) On an initial drug test, you must at or above the cutoff concentration, report a result below the cutoff con- you must conduct a confirmation test. centration as negative. If the result is 601 \u00a740.89 (c) On a confirmation drug test, you must report a result below the cutoff concentration as negative and a result at or above the cutoff concentration as confirmed positive. (d) You must report quantitative val\u00ad ues for morphine or codeine at 15,000 ng/mL or above. \u00a7 40.89 What is validity testing, and are laboratories required to con- duct it? (a) Specimen validity testing is the evaluation of the specimen to deter- mine if it is consistent with normal human urine. The purpose of validity testing is to determine whether certain adulterants or foreign substances were added to the urine, if the urine was di\u00adluted, or if the specimen was sub\u00adstituted. (b) As a laboratory, you are author\u00ad ized to conduct validity testing. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41951, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.91 What validity tests must labora\u00ad tories conduct on primary speci\u00ad mens? As a laboratory, when you conduct validity testing under \u00a7 40.89, you must conduct it in accordance with the re\u00ad quirements of this section. (a) You must test each primary speci\u00ad men for creatinine. You must also de\u00adtermine its specific gravity if you find that the creatinine concentration is less than 20 mg/dL. (b) You must measure the pH of each primary specimen. (c) You must test each primary speci\u00ad men to determine if it contains sub-stances that may be used to adulterate the specimen. Your tests must have the capability of determining whether any substance identified in current HHS re\u00adquirements or specimen validity guid\u00adance is present in the specimen. (d) If you suspect the presence of an interfering substance/adulterant that could make a test result invalid, but you are unable to identify it (e.g., a new adulterant), you must, as the first laboratory, send the specimen to an-other HHS certified laboratory that has the capability of doing so. (e) If you identify a substance in a specimen that appears to be an adulterant, but which is not listed in 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) current HHS requirements or guidance, you must report the finding in writing to ODAPC and the Division of Work- place Programs, HHS, within three business days. You must also complete testing of the specimen for drugs, to the extent technically feasible. (f) You must conserve as much as possible of the specimen for possible fu\u00ad ture testing. \u00a7 40.93 What criteria do laboratories use to establish that a specimen is dilute or substituted? (a) As a laboratory you must con\u00ad sider the primary specimen to be dilute if the creatinine concentration is less than 20 mg/dL and the specific gravity is less than 1.003, unless the criteria for a substituted specimen are met. (b) As a laboratory you must con\u00ad sider the primary specimen to be sub\u00adstituted if the creatinine concentration is less than or equal to 5 mg/dL and the specific gravity is less than or equal to 1.001 or greater than or equal to 1.020. \u00a7 40.95 What criteria do laboratories use to establish that a specimen is adulterated? (a) As a laboratory, you must con\u00ad sider the primary specimen to be adul\u00ad terated if you determine that\u2014 (1) A substance that is not expected to be present in human urine is identi\u00adfied in the specimen; (2) A substance that is expected to be present in human urine is identified at a concentration so high that it is not consistent with human urine; or (3) The physical characteristics of the specimen are outside the normal expected range for human urine. (b) In making your determination under paragraph (a) of this section, you must apply the criteria in current HHS requirements or specimen validity guidance. \u00a7 40.97 What do laboratories report and how do they report it? (a) As a laboratory, you must report the results for each primary specimen tested as one or more of the following: (1) Negative; (2) Negative\u2014dilute; (3) Rejected for testing, with re- mark(s); (4) Positive, with drug(s)/metabo\u00ad lite(s) noted; 602 Office of the Secretary of Transportation (5) Positive, with drug(s)/metabo\u00ad lite(s) noted\u2014dilute; (6) Adulterated, with remark(s); (7) Substituted, with remark(s); or (8) Invalid result, with remark(s). (b) As a laboratory, you must report laboratory results directly, and only, to the MRO at his or her place of busi\u00adness. You must not report results to or through the DER or a service agent (e.g., C/TPA). (1) Negative results: You must fax, courier, mail, or electronically trans\u00admit a legible image or copy of the fully-completed Copy 1 of the CCF which has been signed by the certifying scientist, or you may provide the lab-oratory results report electronically (i.e., computer data file). (i) If you elect to provide the labora\u00ad tory results report, you must include the following elements, as a minimum, in the report format: (A) Laboratory name and address; (B) Employer's name (you may in\u00ad clude I.D. or number, (F) Reason for test, if provided; (G) Collector's name and telephone number; (H) Date of the collection; (I) Date received at the laboratory; (J) Date certifying scientist released the results; (K) Certifying scientist's name; (L) Results (e.g., positive, adulter\u00ad ated) as listed in paragraph (a) of this section; and (M) Remarks section, with an expla\u00ad nation of any situation in which a cor\u00adrectable flaw has been corrected. (ii) You may release the laboratory results report only after review and ap\u00adproval by the certifying scientist. It must reflect the same test result infor\u00admation as contained on the CCF signed by the certifying scientist. The infor\u00admation contained in the laboratory re\u00adsults report may not contain informa\u00adtion that does not appear on the CCF. (iii) The results report may be trans\u00ad mitted through any means that en\u00adsures accuracy and confidentiality. You, as the laboratory, together with the MRO, must ensure that the infor\u00admation is adequately protected from \u00a740.99 unauthorized access or release, both during transmission and in storage. (2) Non-negative results: You must fax, courier, mail, or electronically transmit a legible image or copy of the fully-completed Copy 1 of the CCF that has been signed by the certifying sci\u00adentist. In addition, you may provide the electronic laboratory results report following the format and procedures set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section. (c) In transmitting laboratory results to the MRO, you, as the laboratory, to\u00adgether with the MRO, must ensure that the information is adequately pro\u00adtected from unauthorized access or re-lease, both during transmission and in storage. If the results are provided by fax, the fax connection must have a fixed telephone number accessible only to authorized individuals. (d) You must transmit test results to the MRO in a timely manner, pref\u00aderably the same day that review by the certifying scientist is completed. (e) You must provide quantitative values for confirmed positive drug, adulterated, and substituted test re\u00adsults to the MRO when the MRO re-quests you to do so in writing. The MRO's request may either be a general request covering all such results you send to the MRO or a specific case-by-case request. (f) You must provide quantitative values for confirmed opiate results for morphine or codeine at 15,000 ng/mL or above, even if the MRO has not re-quested quantitative values for the test result. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41951, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.99 How long does the laboratory retain specimens after testing? (a) As a laboratory testing the pri\u00ad mary specimen, you must retain a specimen that was reported with posi\u00adtive, adulterated, substituted, or in-valid results for a minimum of one year. (b) You must keep such a specimen in secure, long-term, frozen storage in ac\u00adcordance with HHS requirements. (c) Within the one-year period, the MRO, the employee, the employer, or a DOT agency may request in writing 603 \u00a740.101 that you retain a specimen for an addi\u00ad tional period of time (e.g., for the pur\u00ad pose of preserving evidence for litiga\u00adtion or a safety investigation). If you receive such a request, you must com\u00ad ply with it. If you do not receive such a request, you may discard the speci\u00ad men at the end of the year. (d) If you have not sent the split specimen to another laboratory for testing, you must retain the split spec\u00ad imen for an employee's test for the same period of time that you retain the primary specimen and under the same storage conditions. (e) As the laboratory testing the split specimen, you must meet the require\u00ad ments of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section with respect to the split specimen. \u00a7 40.101 What relationship may a lab- oratory have with an MRO? (a) As a laboratory, you may not enter into any relationship with an MRO that creates a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of inter\u00ad est with the MRO's responsibilities for the employer. You may not derive any financial benefit by having an em\u00ad ployer use a specific MRO. (b) The following are examples of re\u00ad lationships between laboratories and MROs that the Department regards as creating conflicts of interest, or the ap\u00ad pearance of such conflicts. This fol\u00ad lowing list of examples is not intended to be exclusive or exhaustive: (1) The laboratory employs an MRO who reviews test results produced by the laboratory; (2) The laboratory has a contract or retainer with the MRO for the review of test results produced by the labora\u00ad tory; (3) The laboratory designates which MRO the employer is to use, gives the employer a slate of MROs from which to choose, or recommends certain MROs; (4) The laboratory gives the employer a discount or other incentive to use a particular MRO; (5) The laboratory has its place of business co-located with that of an MRO or MRO staff who review test re\u00ad sults produced by the laboratory; or 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) (6) The laboratory permits an MRO, or an MRO's organization, to have a fi\u00ad nancial interest in the laboratory. \u00a7 40.103 What are the requirements for submitting blind specimens to a laboratory? (a) As an employer or C/TPA with an aggregate of 2000 or more DOT-covered employees, you must send blind speci\u00ad mens to laboratories you use. If you have an aggregate of fewer than 2000 DOT-covered employees, you are not required to provide blind specimens. (b) To each laboratory to which you send at least 100 specimens in a year, you must transmit a number of blind specimens equivalent to one percent of the specimens you send to that labora\u00ad tory, up to a maximum of 50 blind specimens in each quarter (i.e., Janu\u00ad ary-March, April-June, July-Sep\u00ad tember, October-December). As a C/ TPA, you must apply this percentage to the total number of DOT-covered employees' specimens you send to the laboratory. Your blind specimen sub-missions must be evenly spread throughout the year. The following ex\u00ad amples illustrate how this requirement works: Example 1 to Paragraph (b). You send 2500 specimens to Lab X in Year 1. In this case, you would send 25 blind specimens to Lab X in Year 1. To meet the even distribution re\u00ad quirement, you would send 6 in each of three quarters and 7 in the other. Example 2 to Paragraph (b). You send 2000 specimens to Lab X and 1000 specimens to Lab Y in Year 1. In this case, you would send 20 blind specimens to Lab X and 10 to Lab Y in Year 1. The even distribution requirement would apply in a similar way to that de-scribed in Example 1. Example 3 to Paragraph (b). Same as Exam\u00ad ple 2, except that you also send 20 specimens to Lab Z. In this case, you would send blind specimens to Labs X and Y as in Example 2. You would not have to send any blind speci\u00ad mens to Lab Z, because you sent fewer than 100 specimens to Lab Z. Example 4 to Paragraph (b). You are a C/ TPA sending 2000 specimens to Lab X in Year 1. These 2000 specimens represent 200 small employers who have an average of 10 covered employees each. In this case you\u2014not the in\u00addividual employers\u2014send 20 blind specimens to Lab X in Year 1, again ensuring even dis\u00ad tribution. The individual employers you rep\u00adresent are not required to provide any blind specimens on their own. 604 Office of the Secretary of Transportation Example 5 to Paragraph (b). You are a large C/TPA that sends 40,000 specimens to Lab Y in Year 1. One percent of that figure is 400. However, the 50 blind specimen per quarter ''cap'' means that you need send only 50 blind specimens per quarter, rather than the 100 per quarter you would have to send to meet the one percent rate. Your annual total would be 200, rather than 400, blind speci\u00admens. (c) Approximately 75 percent of the specimens you submit must be blank (i.e., containing no drugs, nor adulter\u00ad ated or substituted). Approximately 15 percent must be positive for one or more of the five drugs involved in DOT tests, and approximately 10 percent must either be adulterated with a sub-stance cited in HHS guidance or sub\u00adstituted (i.e., having specific gravity and creatinine meeting the criteria of \u00a740.93(b)). (1) The blind specimens that you sub\u00ad mit that contain drugs, that are adul\u00adterated with a substance cited in HHS guidance, or that are substituted must be validated as to their contents by the supplier using initial and confirmatory tests. (2) The supplier must provide infor\u00ad mation regarding the shelf life of the blind specimens. (3) If the blind specimen is drug posi\u00ad tive, the concentration of drug it con\u00adtains must be between 1.5 and 2 times the initial drug test cutoff concentra\u00adtion. (4) If the blind specimen is adulter\u00ad ated with nitrite, the concentration of nitrite it contains must be between 1.5 and 2 times the initial validity test cutoff concentration. (5) If the blind specimen is adulter\u00ad ated by altering pH, the pH must be less than or equal to 2, or greater than or equal to 12. (6) If the blind specimen is sub\u00ad stituted, the creatinine must be less than or equal to 2, and the specific gravity must be 1.000. (d) You must ensure that each blind specimen is indistinguishable to the laboratory from a normal specimen. (1) You must submit blind specimens to the laboratory using the same chan\u00adnels (e.g., via a regular collection site) through which employees' specimens are sent to the laboratory. (2) You must ensure that the col\u00ad lector uses a CCF, places fictional ini-\u00a740.109 tials on the specimen bottle label/seal, indicates for the MRO on Copy 2 that the specimen is a blind specimen, and discards Copies 4 and 5 (employer and employee copies). (3) You must ensure that all blind specimens include split specimens. \u00a7 40.105 What happens if the labora\u00ad tory reports a result different from that expected for a blind specimen? (a) If you are an employer, MRO, or C/TPA who submits a blind specimen, and if the result reported to the MRO is different from the result expected, you must investigate the discrepancy. (b) If the unexpected result is a false negative, you must provide the labora\u00adtory with the expected results (ob\u00adtained from the supplier of the blind specimen), and direct the laboratory to determine the reason for the discrep\u00adancy. (c) If the unexpected result is a false positive, you must provide the labora\u00adtory with the expected results (ob\u00adtained from the supplier of the blind specimen), and direct the laboratory to determine the reason for the discrep\u00adancy. You must also notify ODAPC of the discrepancy by telephone (202-366- 3784) or e-mail (addresses are listed on the ODAPC web site, http:// www.dot.gov/ost/dapc). ODAPC will no\u00adtify HHS who take appropriate ac\u00adtion. \u00a7 40.107 Who may inspect laboratories? As a laboratory, you must permit an inspection, with or without prior no\u00adtice, by ODAPC, a DOT agency, or a DOT-regulated employer that con-tracts with the laboratory for drug testing under the DOT drug testing program, or the designee of such an employer. \u00a7 40.109 What documentation must the laboratory keep, and for how long? (a) As a laboratory, you must retain all records pertaining to each employee urine specimen for a minimum of two years. (b) As a laboratory, you must also keep for two years employer-specific data required in \u00a7 40.111. (c) Within the two-year period, the MRO, the employee, the employer, or a DOT agency may request in writing 605 \u00a740.111 that you retain the records for an addi\u00ad tional period of time (e.g., for the pur\u00ad pose of preserving evidence for litiga\u00adtion or a safety investigation). If you receive such a request, you must com\u00adply with it. If you do not receive such a request, you may discard the records at the end of the two-year period. \u00a7 40.111 When and how must a labora\u00ad tory disclose statistical summaries and other information it maintains? (a) As a laboratory, you must trans\u00ad mit an aggregate statistical summary, by employer, of the data listed in Ap\u00adpendix B to this part to the employer on a semi-annual basis. (1) The summary must not reveal the identity of any employee. (2) In order to avoid sending data from which it is likely that informa\u00adtion about an employee's test result can be readily inferred, you must not send a summary if the employer has fewer than five aggregate tests results. (3) The summary must be sent by January 20 of each year for July 1 through December 31 of the prior year. (4) The summary must also be sent by July 20 of each year for January 1 through June 30 of the current year. (b) When the employer requests a summary in response to an inspection, audit, or review by a DOT agency, you must provide it unless the employer had fewer than five aggregate test re\u00adsults. In that case, you must send the employer a report indicating that not enough testing was conducted to war-rant a summary. You may transmit the summary or report by hard copy, fax, or other electronic means. (c) You must also release information to appropriate parties as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 40.329 and 40.331. \u00a7 40.113 Where is other information concerning laboratories found in this regulation? You can find more information con\u00ad cerning laboratories in several sections of this part: \u00a740.3\u2014Definition. \u00a7 40.13\u2014Prohibition on making specimens available for 40.31\u2014Conflicts of interest concerning col\u00ad lectors. \u00a7 40.47\u2014Laboratory rejections of test for im\u00ad 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) \u00a7 40.125\u2014Conflicts of interest concerning \u00a7 in split spec\u00ad imen tests. \u00a7 40.177\u2014Role of second laboratory in split specimen tests (drugs). \u00a7 40.179\u2014Role of second laboratory in split specimen tests (adulterants). \u00a7 40.181\u2014Role of second laboratory in split specimen tests (substitution). \u00a7\u00a7 40.183-40.185\u2014Transmission of split speci\u00ad men test results to MRO. \u00a7\u00a7 40.201-40.205\u2014Role in correcting errors. \u00a7 40.329\u2014Release of information to ees. \u00a7 40.331\u2014Limits on release of information. \u00a7 40.355\u2014Role with respect to other service agents. Subpart G\u2014Medical Review Offi\u00ad cers and the Verification Process \u00a7 40.121 Who is qualified to act as an MRO? To be qualified to act as an MRO in the DOT drug testing program, you must meet each of the requirements of this section: (a) Credentials. You must be a li\u00ad censed physician (Doctor of Medicine or Osteopathy). If you are a licensed physician in any U.S., Canadian, or Mexican jurisdiction and meet the other requirements of this section, you are authorized to perform MRO serv\u00adices with respect to all covered em\u00adployees, wherever they are located. For example, if you are licensed as an M.D. in one state or province in the U.S., Canada, or Mexico, you are not limited to performing MRO functions in that state or province, and you may perform MRO functions for employees in other states or provinces without becoming licensed to practice medicine in the other jurisdictions. (b) Basic knowledge. You must be knowledgeable in the following areas: (1) You must be knowledgeable about and have clinical experience in con-trolled substances abuse disorders, in\u00adcluding detailed knowledge of alter-native medical explanations for labora\u00adtory confirmed drug test results. (2) You must be knowledgeable about issues relating to adulterated and sub\u00adstituted specimens as well as the pos\u00adsible medical causes of specimens hav\u00ading an invalid result. 606 Office of the Secretary of Transportation (3) You must be knowledgeable about this part, the DOT MRO Guidelines, and the DOT agency regulations appli\u00adcable to the employers for whom you evaluate drug test results, and you must keep current on any changes to these materials. The DOT MRO Guide-lines document is available from ODAPC (Department of Transpor\u00adtation, 400 7th Street, SW., Room 10403, Washington, DC 20590, 202-366-3784, or on the ODAPC web site (http:// www.dot.gov/ ost/dapc)). (c) Qualification training. You must receive qualification training meeting the requirements of this paragraph (c). (1) Qualification training must pro- vide instruction on the following sub\u00adjects: (i) Collection procedures for urine specimens; (ii) Chain of custody, reporting, and recordkeeping; (iii) Interpretation of drug and valid\u00ad ity tests results; (iv) The role and responsibilities of the MRO in the DOT drug testing pro-gram; (v) The interaction with other par\u00ad ticipants in the program (e.g., DERs, SAPs); and (vi) Provisions of this part and DOT agency rules applying to employers for whom you review test results, includ\u00ading changes and updates to this part and DOT agency rules, guidance, inter\u00adpretations, and policies affecting the performance of MRO functions, as well as issues that MROs confront in car\u00adrying out their duties under this part and DOT agency rules. (2) Following your completion of qualification training under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, you must satisfac\u00adtorily complete an examination admin\u00adistered by a nationally-recognized MRO certification board or subspecialty board for medical practitioners in the field of medical review of DOT-man-dated drug tests. The examination must comprehensively cover all the elements of qualification training list\u00aded in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. (3) The following is the schedule for qualification training you must meet: (i) If you became an MRO before Au- gust 1, 2001, and have already met the qualification training requirement, you do not have to meet it again. \u00a740.123 (ii) If you became an MRO before Au- gust 1, 2001, but have not yet met the qualification training requirement, you must do so no later than January 31, 2003. (iii) If you become an MRO on or after August 1, 2001, you must meet the qualification training requirement be-fore you begin to perform MRO func\u00adtions. (d) Continuing Education. During each three-year period from the date on which you satisfactorily complete the examination under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must complete con\u00adtinuing education consisting of at least 12 professional development hours (e.g., Continuing Education Medical Units) relevant to performing MRO functions. (1) This continuing education must include material concerning new tech\u00adnologies, interpretations, recent guid\u00adance, rule changes, and other informa\u00adtion about developments in MRO prac\u00adtice, pertaining to the DOT program, since the time you met the qualifica\u00adtion training requirements of this sec\u00adtion. (2) Your continuing education activi\u00ad ties must include assessment tools to assist you in determining whether you have adequately learned the material. (3) If you are an MRO who completed the qualification training and exam\u00adination requirements prior to August 1, 2001, you must complete your first in\u00adcrement of 12 CEU hours before August 1, 2004. (e) Documentation. You must main\u00ad tain documentation showing that you currently meet all requirements of this section. You must provide this docu\u00admentation on request to DOT agency representatives and to employers and C/TPAs who are using or negotiating to use your services. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41951, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.123 What are respon\u00ad sibilities in the DOT drug testing program? As an MRO, you have the following basic responsibilities: (a) Acting as an independent and im\u00ad partial ''gatekeeper'' and advocate for the accuracy and integrity of the drug testing process. 607 \u00a740.125 (b) Providing a quality assurance re- view of the drug testing process for the specimens under your purview. This in\u00adcludes, but is not limited to: (1) Ensuring the review of the CCF on all specimen collections for the pur\u00adposes of determining whether there is a problem that may cause a test to be cancelled (see \u00a7\u00a7 40.199-40.203 ). As an MRO, you are not required to review laboratory internal chain of custody documentation. No one is permitted to cancel a test because you have not re-viewed this documentation; (2) Providing feedback to employers, collection sites and laboratories re\u00adgarding performance issues where nec\u00adessary; and (3) Reporting to and consulting with the ODAPC or a relevant DOT agency when you wish DOT assistance in re-solving any program issue. As an em\u00adployer or service agent, you are prohib\u00adited from limiting or attempting to limit the MRO's access to DOT for this purpose and from retaliating in any way against an MRO for discussing drug testing issues with DOT. (c) You must determine whether there is a legitimate medical expla\u00adnation for confirmed positive, adulter\u00adated, substituted, and invalid drug tests results from the laboratory. (d) While you provide medical review of employees' test results, this part does not deem that you have estab\u00adlished a doctor-patient relationship with the employees whose tests you re-view. (e) You must act to investigate and correct problems where possible and notify appropriate parties (e.g., HHS, DOT, employers, service agents) where assistance is needed, (e.g., cancelled or problematic tests, incorrect results, problems with blind specimens). (f) You must ensure the timely flow of test results and other information to employers. (g) You must protect the confiden\u00ad tiality of the drug testing information. (h) You must perform all your func\u00ad tions in compliance with this part and other DOT agency regulations. \u00a7 40.125 What relationship may an MRO have with a laboratory? As an MRO, you may not enter into any relationship with an employer's 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) laboratory that creates a conflict of in\u00adterest or the appearance of a conflict of interest with your responsibilities to that employer. You may not derive any financial benefit by having an em\u00adployer use a specific laboratory. For examples of relationships between lab-oratories and MROs that the Depart\u00adment views as creating a conflict of in\u00adterest or the appearance of such a con\u00adflict, see \u00a7 40.101(b). \u00a7 40.127 What are the MRO's functions in reviewing negative test results? As the MRO, you must do the fol\u00ad lowing with respect to negative drug test results you receive from a labora\u00adtory, prior to verifying the result and releasing it to the DER: (a) Review Copy 2 of the CCF to de\u00ad termine if there are any fatal or cor\u00adrectable errors that may require you to initiate corrective action or to cancel the test (see \u00a7\u00a7 40.199 and 40.203). (b) Review the negative laboratory test result and ensure that it is con\u00adsistent with the information contained on the CCF. (c) Before you report a negative test result, you must have in your posses\u00adsion the following documents: (1) Copy 2 of the CCF, a legible copy of it, or any other CCF copy containing the employee's signature; and (2) A legible copy (fax, photocopy, image) of Copy 1 of the CCF or the electronic laboratory results report that conveys the negative laboratory test result. (d) If the copy of the documentation provided to you by the collector or lab-oratory appears unclear, you must re-quest that the collector or laboratory send you a legible copy. (e) On Copy 2 of the CCF, place a check mark in the ''Negative'' box (Step 6), provide your name, and sign, initial, or stamp and date the verification statement. (f) Report the result in a confidential manner (see \u00a7\u00a7 40.163-40.167). (g) Staff under your direct, personal supervision may perform the adminis\u00adtrative functions of this section for you, but only you can cancel a test. If you cancel a laboratory-confirmed neg\u00adative result, check the ''Test Can-celled'' box (Step 6) on Copy 2 of the CCF, make appropriate annotation in 608 Office of the Secretary of Transportation the ''Remarks'' line, provide your name, and sign, initial or stamp and date the verification statement. (1) On specimen results that are re- viewed by your staff, you are respon\u00adsible for assuring the quality of their work. (2) You are required to personally re- view at least 5 percent of all CCFs re- viewed by your staff on a quarterly basis, including all results that re\u00ad quired a corrective action. However, you need not review more than 500 neg\u00adative results in any quarter. (3) Your review must, as a minimum, include the CCF, negative laboratory test result, any accompanying correc\u00adtive documents, and the report sent to the employer. You must correct any er\u00adrors that you discover. You must take action as necessary to ensure compli\u00adance by your staff with this part and document your corrective action. You must attest to the quality assurance review by initialing the CCFs that you review. (4) You must make these CCFs easily identifiable and retrievable by you for review by DOT agencies. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41951, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.129 What are the MRO's functions in reviewing laboratory confirmed positive, adulterated, substituted, or invalid drug test results? (a) As the MRO, you must do the fol\u00ad lowing with respect to confirmed posi\u00ad tive, adulterated, substituted, or in-valid drug tests you receive from a lab-oratory, before you verify the result and release it to the DER: (1) Review Copy 2 of the CCF to de\u00ad termine if there are any fatal or cor\u00adrectable errors that may require you to cancel the test (see \u00a7\u00a7 40.199 and 40.203). Staff under your direct, personal super-vision may conduct this administrative review for you, but only you may verify or cancel a test. (2) Review Copy 1 of the CCF and en- sure that it is consistent with the in-formation contained on Copy 2, that the test result is legible, and that the certifying scientist signed the form. You are not required to review any other documentation generated by the laboratory during their analysis or \u00a740.129 handling of the specimen (e.g., the lab- oratory internal chain of custody). (3) If the copy of the documentation provided to you by the collector or lab-oratory appears unclear, you must re-quest that the collector or laboratory send you a legible copy. (4) Except in the circumstances spelled out in \u00a7 40.133 , conduct a verification interview. This interview must include direct contact in person or by telephone between you and the employee. You may initiate the verification process based on the lab-oratory results report. (5) Verify the test result as either negative, positive, test cancelled, or re\u00adfusal to test because of adulteration or substitution, consistent with the re\u00adquirements of \u00a7\u00a7 40.135-40.145 and 40.159 . (b) Before you report a verified nega\u00ad tive, positive, test cancelled, refusal to test because of adulteration or substi\u00adtution, you must have in your posses\u00adsion the following documents: (1) Copy 2 of the CCF, a legible copy of it, or any other CCF copy containing the employee's signature; and (2) A legible copy (fax, photocopy, image) of Copy 1 of the CCF, con\u00adtaining the certifying scientist's signa\u00ad ture. (c) With respect to verified positive test results, place a check mark in the ''Positive'' box (Step 6) on Copy 2 of the CCF, indicate the drug(s)/ metabo\u00adlite(s) detected on the ''Remarks'' line, sign and date the verification state\u00adment. (d) If you cancel a laboratory con- firmed positive, adulterated, sub\u00adstituted, or invalid drug test report, check the ''test cancelled'' box (Step 6) on Copy 2 of the CCF, make appro\u00adpriate annotation in the ''Remarks'' line, sign, provide your name, and date the verification statement. (e) Report the result in a confidential manner (see \u00a7\u00a7 40.163-40.167 ). (f) With respect to adulteration or substitution test results, check the ''refusal to test because:'' box (Step 6) on Copy 2 of the CCF, check the ''Adul\u00adterated'' or ''Substituted'' box, as ap\u00adpropriate, make appropriate annota\u00adtion in the ''Remarks'' line, sign and date the verification statement. (g) As the MRO, your actions con\u00ad cerning reporting confirmed positive, 609 \u00a740.131 adulterated, or substituted results to the employer before you have com\u00adpleted the verification process are also governed by the stand-down provisions of \u00a740.21 . (1) If an employer has a stand-down policy that meets the requirements of \u00a7 40.21 , you may report to the DER that you have received an employee's laboratory confirmed positive, adulter\u00adated, or substituted test result, con\u00adsistent with the terms of the waiver the employer received. You must not provide any further details about the test result (e.g., the name of the drug involved). (2) If the employer does not have a stand-down policy that meets the re\u00adquirements of \u00a7 40.21 , you must not in- form the employer that you have re\u00adceived an employee's laboratory con-firmed positive, adulterated, or sub\u00adstituted test result until you verify the test result. For example, as an MRO employed directly by a company, you must not tell anyone on the company's staff or management that you have re\u00adceived an employee's laboratory con-firmed test result. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as at 66 FR 41952, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.131 How does the MRO or DER no\u00ad tify an employee of the verification process after a confirmed positive, adulterated, substituted, or invalid test result? (a) When, as the MRO, you receive a confirmed positive, adulterated, sub\u00ad stituted, or invalid test result from the laboratory, you must contact the em\u00adployee directly (i.e., actually talk to the employee), on a confidential basis, to determine whether the employee wants to discuss the test result. In making this contact, you must explain to the employee that, if he or she de-clines to discuss the result, you will verify the test as positive or as a re\u00adfusal to test because of adulteration or substitution, as applicable. (b) As the MRO, staff under your per\u00ad sonal supervision may conduct this ini\u00adtial contact for you. (1) This staff contact must be limited to scheduling the discussion between you and the employee and explaining the consequences of the employee's de\u00ad clining to speak with you (i.e., that the 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) MRO will verify the test without input from the employee). If the employee declines to speak with you, the staff person must document the employee's decision, including the date and time. (2) A staff person must not gather any medical information or informa\u00ad tion concerning possible explanations for the test result. (3) A staff person may advise an em\u00ad ployee to have medical information (e.g., prescriptions, information form\u00ad ing the basis of a legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed positive test result) ready to present at the interview with the MRO. (4) Since you are required to speak personally with the employee, face-to-face or on the phone, your staff must not inquire if the employee wishes to speak with you. (c) As the MRO, you or your staff must make reasonable efforts to reach the employee at the day and evening telephone numbers listed on the CCF. Reasonable efforts include, as a min\u00adimum, three attempts, spaced reason-ably over a 24-hour period, to reach the employee at the day and evening tele\u00adphone numbers listed on the CCF. If you or your staff cannot reach the em\u00adployee directly after making these ef\u00adforts, you or your staff must take the following steps: (1) Document the efforts you made to contact the employee, including dates and times. If both phone numbers are incorrect (e.g., disconnected, wrong number), you may take the actions listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section without waiting the full 24-hour period. (2) Contact the DER, instructing the DER to contact the employee. (i) You must simply direct the DER to inform the employee to contact you. (ii) You must not inform the DER that the employee has a confirmed positive, adulterated, substituted, or invalid test result. (iii) You must document the dates and times of your attempts to contact the DER, and you must document the name of the DER you contacted and the date and time of the contact. (d) As the DER, you must attempt to contact the employee immediately, using procedures that protect, as much as possible, the confidentiality of the 610 Office of the Secretary of Transportation MRO's request that the employee con- tact the MRO. If you successfully con-tact the employee (i.e., actually talk to the employee), you must document the date and time of the contact, and inform the MRO. You must inform the employee that he or she should contact the MRO immediately. You must also inform the employee of the con-sequences of failing to contact the MRO within the next 72 hours (see \u00a740.133(a)(2)). (1) As the DER, you must not inform anyone else working for the employer that you are seeking to contact the employee on behalf of the MRO. (2) If, as the DER, you have made all reasonable efforts to contact the em\u00adployee but failed to do so, you may place the employee on temporary medi\u00adcally unqualified status or medical leave. Reasonable efforts include, as a minimum, three attempts, spaced rea\u00adsonably over a 24-hour period, to reach the employee at the day and evening telephone numbers listed on the CCF. (i) As the DER, you must document the dates and times of these efforts. (ii) If, as the DER, you are unable to contact the employee within this 24-hour period, you must leave a message for the employee by any practicable means (e.g., voice mail, e-mail, letter) to contact the MRO and inform the MRO of the date and time of this at-tempted contact. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as 66 FR 41952, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.133 Under what circumstances may the MRO verify a test as posi\u00ad tive, or as a refusal to test because of adulteration or substitution, without interviewing the employee? (a) As the MRO, you normally may verify a confirmed positive test (for any drug or drug metabolite, including opiates), or as a refusal to test because of adulteration or substitution, only after interviewing the employee as pro\u00advided in \u00a7\u00a7 40.135-40.145 . However, there are three circumstances in which you may verify such a result without an interview: (1) You may verify a test result as a positive or refusal to test, as applica\u00adble, if the employee expressly declines the opportunity to discuss the test with you. You must maintain complete \u00a740.135 documentation of this occurrence, in\u00adcluding notation of informing, or at-tempting to inform, the employee of the consequences of not exercising the option to speak with the you. (2) You may verify a test result as a positive or refusal to test, as applica\u00adble, if the DER has successfully made and documented a contact with the em\u00adployee and instructed the employee to contact you and more than 72 hours have passed since the time the DER contacted the employee. (3) You may verify a test result as a positive or refusal to test, as applica\u00adble, if neither you nor the DER, after making and documenting all reason-able efforts, has been able to contact the employee within ten days of the date on which the MRO receives the confirmed test result from the labora\u00adtory. (b) As the MRO, when you verify a test result as a positive or refusal to test under this section, you must docu\u00adment the date, time and reason, fol\u00adlowing the instructions in \u00a7 40.163 . (c) As the MRO, after you have verified a test result as a positive or re\u00adfusal to test under this section and re-ported the result to the DER, you must allow the employee to present informa\u00adtion to you within 60 days of the verification documenting that serious illness, injury, or other circumstances unavoidably precluded contact with the MRO and/or DER in the times pro\u00advided. On the basis of such informa\u00adtion, you may reopen the verification, allowing the employee to present infor\u00admation concerning whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for the confirmed test result. \u00a7 40.135 What does the MRO tell the employee at the beginning of the verification interview? (a) As the MRO, you must tell the employee that the laboratory has de\u00ad termined that the employee's test re\u00ad sult was positive, adulterated, sub\u00adstituted, or invalid, as applicable. You must also tell the employee of the drugs for which his or her specimen tested positive, or the basis for the finding of adulteration or substitution. (b) You must explain the verification interview process to the employee and inform the employee that your decision 611 \u00a740.137 will be based on information the em\u00ad ployee provides in the interview. (c) You must explain that, if further medical evaluation is needed for the verification process, the employee must comply with your request for this evaluation and that failure to do so is equivalent of expressly declining to discuss the test result. (d) As the MRO, you must warn an employee who has a confirmed posi\u00ad tive, adulterated, substituted or in- valid test that you are required to pro-vide to third parties drug test result information and medical information affecting the performance of safety-sensitive duties that the employee gives you in the verification process without the employee's consent (see \u00a740.327). (1) You must give this warning to the employee before obtaining any medical information as part of the verification process. (2) For purposes of this paragraph (d), medical information includes informa\u00ad tion on medications or other sub- stances affecting the performance of safety-sensitive duties that the em\u00ad ployee reports using or medical condi\u00ad tions the employee reports having. (3) For purposes of this paragraph (d), the persons to whom this information may be provided include the employer, a SAP evaluating the employee as part of the return to duty process (see \u00a7 40.293(g)), DOT, another Federal safe\u00ad ty agency (e.g., the NTSB), or any state safety agency as required by state law. (e) You must also advise the em\u00ad ployee that, after informing any third party about any medication the em\u00ad ployee is using pursuant to a legally valid prescription under the Controlled Substances Act, you will allow 5 days for the employee to have the pre-scribing physician contact you to de\u00adtermine if the medication can be changed to one that does not make the employee medically unqualified or does not pose a significant safety risk. If, as an MRO, you receive such information from the prescribing physician, you must transmit this information to any third party to whom you previously provided information about the safety 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) risks of the employee's other medica\u00ad tion. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, FR 41952, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.137 On what basis does the MRO verify test results involving mari\u00ad juana, cocaine, amphetamines, or PCP? (a) As the MRO, you must verify a confirmed positive test result for mari\u00ad juana, cocaine, amphetamines, and/or PCP unless the employee presents a le\u00ad gitimate medical explanation for the presence of the drug(s)/metabolite(s) in his or her system. (b) You must offer the employee an opportunity to present a legitimate medical explanation in all cases. (c) The employee has the burden of proof that a legitimate medical expla\u00adnation exists. The employee must present information meeting this bur-den at the time of the verification interview. As the MRO, you have dis\u00adcretion to extend the time available to the employee for this purpose for up to five days before verifying the test re\u00adsult, if you determine that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the employee will be able to produce rel\u00adevant evidence concerning a legitimate medical explanation within that time. (d) If you determine that there is a legitimate medical explanation, you must verify the test result as negative. Otherwise, you must verify the test re\u00adsult as positive. (e) In determining whether a legiti\u00ad mate medical explanation exists, you may consider the employee's use of a medication from a foreign country. You must exercise your professional judgment consistently with the fol\u00adlowing principles: (1) There can be a legitimate medical explanation only with respect to a sub-stance that is obtained legally in a for\u00adeign country. (2) There can be a legitimate medical explanation only with respect to a sub-stance that has a legitimate medical use. Use of a drug of abuse (e.g., heroin, PCP, marijuana) or any other sub-stance (see \u00a7 40.151(f) and (g)) that can- not be viewed as having a legitimate medical use can never be the basis for a legitimate medical explanation, even 612 Office of the Secretary of Transportation if the substance is obtained legally in a foreign country. (3) Use of the substance can form the basis of a legitimate medical expla\u00ad nation only if it is used consistently with its proper and intended medical purpose. (4) Even if you find that there is a le\u00ad gitimate medical explanation under this paragraph (e) and verify a test negative, you may have a responsi\u00ad bility to raise fitness-for-duty consid\u00ad erations with the employer (see \u00a740.327). \u00a7 40.139 On what basis does the MRO verify test results involving opi\u00ad ates? As the MRO, you must proceed as fol\u00ad lows when you receive a laboratory confirmed positive opiate result: (a) If the laboratory detects the pres\u00ad ence of 6-acetylmorphine (6-AM) in the specimen, you must verify the test re\u00ad sult positive. (b) In the absence of 6-AM, if the lab- oratory detects the presence of either morphine or codeine at 15,000 ng/mL or above, you must verify the test result positive unless the employee presents a legitimate medical explanation for the presence of the drug or drug metabolite in his or her system, as in the case of other drugs (see \u00a7 40.137). Consumption of food products (e.g., poppy seeds) must not be considered a legitimate medical explanation for the employee having morphine or codeine at these concentrations. (c) For all other opiate positive re\u00ad sults, you must verify a confirmed positive test result for opiates only if you determine that there is clinical evidence, in addition to the urine test, of unauthorized use of any opium, opi\u00adate, or opium derivative (i.e., mor\u00ad phine, heroin, or codeine). (1) As an MRO, it is your responsi\u00ad bility to use your best professional and ethical judgement and discretion to de\u00ad termine whether there is clinical evi\u00ad dence of unauthorized use of opiates. Examples of information that you may consider in making this judgement in\u00ad clude, but are not limited to, the fol\u00ad lowing: (i) Recent needle tracks; \u00a740.141 (ii) Behavioral and psychological signs of acute opiate intoxication or withdrawal; (iii) Clinical history of unauthorized use recent enough to have produced the laboratory test result; (iv) Use of a medication from a for\u00ad eign country. See \u00a7 40.137(e) for guid\u00ad ance on how to make this determina\u00ad tion. (2) In order to establish the clinical evidence referenced in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, personal observation of the employee is essen\u00adtial. (i) Therefore, you, as the MRO, must conduct, or cause another physician to conduct, a face-to-face examination of the employee. (ii) No face-to-face examination is needed in establishing the clinical evi\u00ad dence referenced in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) or (iv) of this section. (3) To be the basis of a verified posi\u00ad tive result for opiates, the clinical evi\u00ad dence you find must concern a drug that the laboratory found in the speci\u00ad men. (For example, if the test con-firmed the presence of codeine, and the employee admits to unauthorized use of hydrocodone, you do not have grounds for verifying the test positive. The admission must be for the sub-stance that was found). (4) As the MRO, you have the burden of establishing that there is clinical evidence of unauthorized use of opiates referenced in this paragraph (c). If you cannot make this determination (e.g., there is not sufficient clinical evidence or history), you must verify the test as negative. The employee does not need to show you that a legitimate medical explanation exists if no clinical evi\u00addence is established. \u00a7 40.141 How does the MRO obtain in- formation for the verification deci\u00ad sion? As the MRO, you must do the fol\u00ad lowing as you make the determinations needed for a verification decision: (a) You must conduct a medical interview. You must review the em\u00adployee's medical history and any other relevant biomedical factors presented to you by the employee. You may di\u00adrect the employee to undergo further 613 \u00a740.143 medical evaluation by you or another physician. (b) If the employee asserts that the presence of a drug or drug metabolite in his or her specimen results from taking prescription medication, you must review and take all reasonable and necessary steps to verify the au\u00adthenticity of all medical records the employee provides. You may contact the employee's physician or other rel\u00adevant medical personnel for further in-formation. \u00a7 40.143 [Reserved] \u00a7 40.145 On what basis does MRO verify test results involving adulter\u00ad ation or substitution? (a) As an MRO, when you receive a laboratory report that a specimen is adulterated or substituted, you must treat that report in the same way you treat the laboratory's report of a con- firmed positive test for a drug or drug metabolite. (b) You must follow the same proce\u00ad dures used for verification of a con-firmed positive test for a drug or drug metabolite (see \u00a7\u00a7 40.129-40.135, 40.141, 40.151), except as otherwise provided in this section. (c) In the verification interview, you must explain the laboratory findings to the employee and address technical questions or issues the employee may raise. (d) You must offer the employee the opportunity to present a legitimate medical explanation for the laboratory findings with respect to presence of the adulterant in, or the creatinine and specific gravity findings for, the speci\u00admen. (e) The employee has the burden of proof that there is a legitimate med\u00adical explanation. (1) To meet this burden in the case of an adulterated specimen, the employee must demonstrate that the adulterant found by the laboratory entered the specimen through physiological means. (2) To meet this burden in the case of a substituted specimen, the employee must demonstrate that he or she did produce or could have produced urine, through physiological means, meeting the creatinine and specific gravity cri\u00adteria of \u00a7 40.93(b). 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) (3) The employee must present infor\u00ad mation meeting this burden at the time of the verification interview. As the MRO, you have discretion to ex-tend the time available to the em\u00ad ployee for this purpose for up to five days before verifying the specimen, if you determine that there is a reason-able basis to believe that the employee will be able to produce relevant evi\u00ad dence supporting a legitimate medical explanation within that time. (f) As the MRO or the employer, you are not responsible for arranging, con\u00ad ducting, or paying for any studies, ex\u00ad aminations or analyses to determine whether a legitimate medical expla\u00ad nation exists. (g) As the MRO, you must exercise your best professional judgment in de\u00adciding whether the employee has estab\u00ad lished a legitimate medical expla\u00adnation. (1) If you determine that the employ\u00ad ee's explanation does not present a rea\u00ad sonable basis for concluding that there may be a legitimate medical expla\u00adnation, you must report the test to the DER as a verified refusal to test be- cause of adulteration or substitution, as applicable. (2) If you believe that the employee's explanation may present a reasonable basis for concluding that there is a le\u00ad gitimate medical explanation, you must direct the employee to obtain, within the five-day period set forth in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a fur\u00adther medical evaluation. This evalua\u00adtion must be performed by a licensed physician (the ''referral physician''), acceptable to you, with expertise in the medical issues raised by the employee's explanation. (The MRO may perform this evaluation if the MRO has appro\u00adpriate expertise.) (i) As the MRO or employer, you are not responsible for finding or paying a referral physician. However, on request of the employee, you must provide rea\u00adsonable assistance to the employee's efforts to find such a physician. The final choice of the referral physician is the employee's, as long as the physi\u00adcian is acceptable to you. (ii) As the MRO, you must consult with the referral physician, providing guidance to him or her concerning his 614 Office of the Secretary of Transportation or her responsibilities under this sec\u00ad tion. As part of this consultation, you must provide the following information to the referral physician: (A) That the employee was required to take a DOT drug test, but the lab-oratory reported that the specimen was adulterated or substituted, which is treated as a refusal to test; (B) The consequences of the appro\u00ad priate DOT agency regulation for refus\u00ading to take the required drug test; (C) That the referral physician must agree to follow the requirements of paragraphs (g)(3) through (g)(4) of this section; and (D) That the referral physician must provide you with a signed statement of his or her recommendations. (3) As the referral physician, you must evaluate the employee and con\u00adsider any evidence the employee pre\u00adsents concerning the employee's med\u00ad ical explanation. You may conduct ad\u00additional tests to determine whether there is a legitimate medical expla\u00adnation. Any additional urine tests must be performed in an HHS-certified laboratory. (4) As the referral physician, you must then make a written rec\u00adommendation to the MRO about whether the MRO should determine that there is a legitimate medical ex-planation. As the MRO, you must seri\u00adously consider and assess the referral physician's recommendation in decid\u00ading whether there is a legitimate med\u00adical explanation. (5) As the MRO, if you determine that there is a legitimate medical ex-planation, you must cancel the test and inform ODAPC in writing of the determination and the basis for it (e.g., referral physician's findings, evidence produced by the employee). (6) As the MRO, if you determine that there is not a legitimate medical explanation, you must report the test to the DER as a verified refusal to test because of adulteration or substi\u00adtution. (h) The following are examples of types of evidence an employee could present to support an assertion of a le\u00adgitimate medical explanation for a sub\u00adstituted result. (1) Medically valid evidence dem\u00ad onstrating that the employee is capa-\u00a740.149 ble of physiologically producing urine meeting the creatinine and specific gravity criteria of \u00a7 40.93(b) . (i) To be regarded as medically valid, the evidence must have been gathered using appropriate methodology and controls to ensure its accuracy and re-liability. (ii) Assertion by the employee that his or her personal characteristics (e.g., with respect to race, gender, weight, diet, working conditions) are respon\u00adsible for the substituted result does not, in itself, constitute a legitimate medical explanation. To make a case that there is a legitimate medical ex-planation, the employee must present evidence showing that the cited per\u00ad sonal characteristics actually result in the physiological production of urine meeting the creatinine and specific gravity criteria of \u00a7 40.93(b) . (2) Information from a medical eval\u00ad uation under paragraph (g) of this sec\u00ad tion that the individual has a medical condition that has been demonstrated to cause the employee to physiologi\u00ad cally produce urine meeting the creati\u00ad nine and specific gravity criteria of \u00a7 40.93(b) . (i) A finding or diagnosis by the phy\u00ad sician that an employee has a medical condition, in itself, does not constitute a legitimate medical explanation. (ii) To establish there is a legitimate medical explanation, the employee must demonstrate that the cited med\u00ad ical condition actually results in the physiological production of urine meet\u00ad ing the creatinine and [Reserved] \u00a7 40.149 May the MRO change a verified positive drug test result or refusal to test? (a) As the MRO, you may change a verified positive or refusal to test drug test result only in the following situa\u00ad tions: (1) When you have reopened a verification that was done without an interview with an employee (see \u00a740.133(c)). (2) If you receive information, not available to you at the time of the original verification, demonstrating that the laboratory made an error in identifying (e.g., a paperwork mistake) 615 \u00a740.151 or testing (e.g., a false positive or nega\u00ad tive) the employee's primary or split specimen. For example, suppose the laboratory originally reported a posi\u00adtive test result for Employee X and a negative result for Employee Y. You verified the test results as reported to you. Then the laboratory notifies you that it mixed up the two test results, and X was really negative and Y was really positive. You would change X's test result from positive to negative and contact Y to conduct a verification interview. (3) If, within 60 days of the original verification decision\u2014 (i) You receive information that could not reasonably have been pro\u00ad vided to you at the time of the decision demonstrating that there is a legiti\u00admate medical explanation for the pres\u00ad ence of drug(s)/metabolite(s) in the em\u00ad ployee's specimen; or (ii) You receive credible new or addi\u00ad tional evidence that a legitimate med\u00ad ical explanation for an adulterated or substituted result exists. Example to Paragraph (a)(3): If the employ\u00ad ee's physician provides you a valid prescrip\u00ad tion that he or she failed to find at the time of the original verification, you may change the test result from positive to negative if you conclude that the prescription provides a legitimate medical explanation for the drug(s)/ metabolite(s) in the employee's spec\u00ad imen. (4) If you receive the information in paragraph (a)(3) of this section after the 60-day period, you must consult with ODAPC prior to changing the re\u00adsult. (5) When you have made an adminis\u00ad trative error and reported an incorrect result. (b) If you change the result, you must immediately notify the DER in writing, as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 40.163-40.165. (c) You are the only person permitted to change a verified test result, such as a verified positive test result or a de-termination that an individual has re-fused to test because of adulteration or substitution. This is because, as the MRO, you have the sole authority under this part to make medical deter\u00adminations leading to a verified test (e.g., a determination that there was or was not a legitimate medical expla\u00adnation for a laboratory test result). 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) For example, an arbitrator is not per\u00ad mitted to overturn the medical judg\u00ad ment of the MRO that the employee failed to present a legitimate medical explanation for a positive, adulterated, or substituted test result of his or her specimen. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 41952, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.151 What are MROs prohibited from doing as part of the verification process? As an MRO, you are prohibited from doing the following as part of the verification process: (a) You must not consider any evi\u00ad dence from tests of urine samples or other body fluids or tissues (e.g., blood or hair samples) that are not collected or tested in accordance with this part. For example, if an employee tells you he went to his own physician, provided a urine specimen, sent it to a labora\u00adtory, and received a negative test re\u00adsult or a DNA test result questioning the identity of his DOT specimen, you are required to ignore this test result. (b) It is not your function to make decisions about factual disputes be-tween the employee and the collector concerning matters occurring at the collection site that are not reflected on the CCF (e.g., concerning allegations that the collector left the area or left open urine containers where other peo\u00adple could access them). (c) It is not your function to deter- mine whether the employer should have directed that a test occur. For ex-ample, if an employee tells you that the employer misidentified her as the subject of a random test, or directed her to take a reasonable suspicion or post-accident test without proper grounds under a DOT agency drug or alcohol regulation, you must inform the employee that you cannot play a role in deciding these issues. (d) It is not your function to consider explanations of confirmed positive, adulterated, or substituted test results that would not, even if true, constitute a legitimate medical explanation. For example, an employee may tell you that someone slipped amphetamines into her drink at a party, that she un\u00adknowingly ingested a marijuana brownie, or that she traveled in a 616 Office of the Secretary of Transportation closed car with several people smoking crack. MROs are unlikely to be able to verify the facts of such passive or un\u00ad knowing ingestion stories. Even if true, such stories do not present a legiti\u00ad mate medical explanation. Con\u00ad sequently, you must not declare a test as negative based on an explanation of this kind. (e) You must not verify a test nega\u00ad tive based on information that a physi\u00ad cian recommended that the employee use a drug listed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. (e.g., under a state law that purports to authorize such recommendations, such as the ''medical marijuana'' laws that some states have adopted). (f) You must not accept an assertion of consumption or other use of a hemp or other non-prescription marijuana- related product as a basis for verifying a marijuana test negative. You also must not accept such an explanation related to consumption of coca teas as a basis for verifying a cocaine test re\u00adsult as negative. Consuming or using such a product is not a legitimate med\u00ad ical explanation. (g) You must not accept an assertion that there is a legitimate medical ex- planation for the presence of PCP or 6- AM in a specimen. There are no legiti\u00admate medical explanations for the presence of these substances. (h) You must not accept, as a legiti\u00ad mate medical explanation for an adul\u00adterated specimen, an assertion that soap, bleach, or glutaraldehyde entered a specimen through physiological means. There are no physiological means through which these substances can enter a specimen. (i) You must not accept, as a legiti\u00ad mate medical explanation for a sub\u00ad stituted specimen, an assertion that an employee can produce urine with no de\u00adtectable creatinine. There are no phys\u00ad iological means through which a per- son can produce a urine specimen hav\u00ading this characteristic. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as 41952, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a740.155 \u00a7 40.153 How does the MRO notify em\u00ad ployees of their right to a test of the split specimen? (a) As the MRO, when you have verified a drug test as positive for a drug or drug metabolite, or as a refusal to test because of adulteration or sub\u00adstitution, you must notify the em\u00adployee of his or her right to have the split specimen tested. You must also notify the employee of the procedures for requesting a test of the split speci\u00admen. (b) You must inform the employee that he or she has 72 hours from the time you provide this notification to him or her to request a test of the split specimen. (c) You must tell the employee how to contact you to make this request. You must provide telephone numbers or other information that will allow the employee to make this request. As the MRO, you must have the ability to receive the employee's calls at all times during the 72 hour period (e.g., by use of an answering machine with a ''time stamp'' feature when there is no one in your office to answer the phone). (d) You must tell the employee that if he or she makes this request within 72 hours, the employer must ensure that the test takes place, and that the employee is not required to pay for the test from his or her own funds before the test takes place. You must also tell the employee that the employer may seek reimbursement for the cost of the test (see \u00a7 40.173 ). (e) You must tell the employee that additional tests of the specimen e.g., DNA tests) are not authorized. \u00a7 40.155 What does the MRO do when a negative or positive test result is also dilute? (a) When the laboratory reports that a specimen is dilute, you must, as the MRO, report to the DER that the speci\u00admen, in addition to being negative or positive, is dilute. (b) You must check the ''dilute'' box (Step 6) on Copy 2 of the CCF. (c) When you report a dilute speci\u00ad men to the DER, you must explain to 617 \u00a740.157 the DER the employer's obligations and choices under \u00a7 40.197. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.157 [Reserved] \u00a7 40.159 What does the MRO do when a drug test result is invalid? (a) As the MRO, when the laboratory reports that the test result is an in- valid result, you must do the following: (1) Discuss the laboratory results with a certifying scientist to obtain more specific information. (2) Contact the employee and inform the employee that the specimen was in-valid or contained an unexplained interfering substance. In contacting the employee, use the procedures set forth in \u00a7 40.131. (3) After explaining the limits of dis\u00ad closure (see \u00a7\u00a7 40.135(d) and 40.327), you should inquire as to medications the employee may have taken that may interfere with some immunoassay tests. (4) If the employee gives an expla\u00ad nation that is acceptable, you must: (i) Place a check mark in the ''Test Cancelled'' box (Step 6) on Copy 2 of the CCF and enter ''Invalid Result'' and ''direct observation collection not required'' on the ''Remarks'' line. (ii) Report to the DER that the test is cancelled, the reason for cancella\u00adtion, and that no further action is re\u00adquired unless a negative test result is required (i.e., pre-employment, return- to-duty, or follow-up tests). (5) If the employee is unable to pro- vide an explanation and/or a valid pre\u00adscription for a medication that inter\u00adfered with the immunoassay test but denies having adulterated the speci\u00admen, you must: (i) Place a check mark in the ''Test Cancelled'' box (Step 6) on Copy 2 of the CCF and enter ''Invalid Result'' and ''direct observation collection re\u00ad quired'' on the ''Remarks'' line. (ii) Report to the DER that the test is cancelled, the reason for cancella\u00adtion, and that a second collection must take place immediately under direct observation. (iii) Instruct the employer to ensure that the employee has the minimum 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) possible advance notice that he or she must go to the collection site. (b) You may only report an invalid test result when you are in possession of a legible copy of Copy 1 of the CCF. In addition, you must have Copy 2 of the CCF, a legible copy of it, or any other copy of the CCF containing the employee's signature. (c) If the employee admits to having adulterated or substituted the speci\u00admen, you must, on the same day, write and sign your own statement of what the employee told you. You must then report a refusal to test in accordance with \u00a7 40.163 . \u00a7 40.161 What does the MRO do when a drug test specimen is rejected for testing? As the MRO, when the laboratory re- ports that the specimen is rejected for testing (e.g., because of a fatal or un\u00ad corrected flaw), you must do the fol\u00adlowing: (a) Place a check mark in the ''Test Cancelled'' box (Step 6) on Copy 2 of the CCF and enter the reason on the ''Remarks'' line. (b) Report to the DER that the test is cancelled and the reason for cancella\u00adtion, and that no further action is re\u00adquired unless a negative test is re\u00adquired (e.g., in the case of a pre-em\u00ad ployment, return-to-duty, or follow-up test). (c) You may only report a test can- celled because of a rejected for testing test result when you are in possession of a legible copy of Copy 1 of the CCF. In addition, you must have Copy 2 of the CCF, a legible copy of it, or any other copy of the CCF containing the employee's signature. \u00a7 40.163 How does the MRO report drug test results? (a) As the MRO, it is your responsi\u00ad bility to report all drug test results to the employer. (b) You may use a signed or stamped and dated legible photocopy of Copy 2 of the CCF to report test results. (c) If you do not report test results using Copy 2 of the CCF for this pur\u00adpose, you must provide a written re-port (e.g., a letter) for each test result. This report must, as a minimum, in\u00adclude the following information: 618 Office of the Secretary of Transportation (1) Full name, as indicated on the CCF, of the employee tested; (2) Specimen ID number from the CCF and the donor SSN or employee ID number; (3) Reason for the test, if indicated on the CCF (e.g., random, post-acci\u00addent); (4) Date of the collection; (5) Date you received Copy 2 of the CCF; (6) Result of the test (i.e., positive, negative, dilute, refusal to test, test cancelled) and the date the result was verified by the MRO; (7) For verified positive tests, the drug(s)/metabolite(s) for which the test was positive; (8) For cancelled tests, the reason for cancellation; and (9) For refusals to test, the reason for the refusal determination (e.g., in the case of an adulterated test result, the name of the adulterant). (d) As an exception to the reporting requirements of paragraph (b) and (c) of this section, the MRO may report negative results using an electronic data file. (1) If you report negatives using an electronic data file, the report must contain, as a minimum, the informa\u00adtion specified in paragraph (c) of this section, as applicable for negative test results. (2) In addition, the report must con\u00ad tain your name, address, and phone number, the name of any person other than you reporting the results, and the date the electronic results report is re-leased. (e) You must retain a signed or stamped and dated copy of Copy 2 of the CCF in your records. If you do not use Copy 2 for reporting results, you must maintain a copy of the signed or stamped and dated letter in addition to the signed or stamped and dated Copy 2. If you use the electronic data file to report negatives, you must maintain a retrievable copy of that report in a for-mat suitable for inspection and audit\u00ading by a DOT representative. (f) You must not use Copy 1 of the CCF to report drug test results. (g) You must not provide quan\u00ad titative values to the DER or C/TPA for drug or validity test results. How-ever, you must provide the test infor-\u00a740.167 mation in your possession to a SAP who consults with you (see whom does the MRO trans\u00ad mit reports of drug test results? (a) As the MRO, you must report all drug test results to the DER, except in the circumstances provided for in \u00a7 40.345 . (b) If the employer elects to receive reports of results through a C/TPA, acting as an intermediary as provided in \u00a7 40.345 , you must report the results through the designated C/TPA. \u00a7 40.167 How are MRO reports of drug results transmitted to the em\u00ad ployer? As the MRO or C/TPA who transmits drug test results to the employer, you must comply with the following re\u00adquirements: (a) You must report the results in a confidential manner. (b) You must transmit to the DER on the same day the MRO verifies the re\u00adsult or the next business day all verified positive test results, results re\u00adquiring an immediate collection under direct observation, adulterated or sub\u00adstituted specimen results, and other re\u00adfusals to test. (1) Direct telephone contact with the DER is the preferred method of imme\u00addiate reporting. Follow up your phone call with appropriate documentation (see \u00a7 40.163). (2) You are responsible for identi\u00ad fying yourself to the DER, and the DER must have a means to confirm your identification. (3) The MRO's report that you trans\u00ad mit to the employer must contain all of the information required by \u00a7 40.163 . (c) You must transmit the MRO's re- port(s) of verified tests to the DER so that the DER receives it within two days of verification by the MRO. (1) You must fax, courier, mail, or electronically transmit a legible image or copy of either the signed or stamped and dated Copy 2 or the written report (see \u00a7 40.163(b) and (c)). (2) Negative results reported elec\u00ad tronically (i.e., computer data file) do not require an image of Copy 2 or the written report. 619 \u00a740.169 (d) In transmitting test results, you or the C/TPA and the employer must ensure the security of the transmission and limit access to any transmission, storage, or retrieval systems. (e) MRO reports are not subject to modification or change by anyone other than the MRO, as provided in \u00a740.149(c). [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as FR 41953, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.169 Where is other information concerning the role of MROs and the verification process found in this regulation? You can find more information con\u00ad cerning the role of MROs in several sections of this part: \u00a740.3\u2014Definition. form and kit direct observation and other atypical situations. \u00a7 40.83\u2014Laboratory handling of fatal and cor\u00ad rectable flaws. \u00a7 40.97\u2014Laboratory handling of test results and quantitative values. \u00a7 40.99\u2014Authorization of longer laboratory retention of specimens. \u00a7 40.101\u2014Relationship with laboratories; avoidance of conflicts of interest. \u00a7 40.105\u2014Notification of discrepancies in blind specimen results. \u00a7 40.171\u2014Request for test of split specimen. \u00a7 40.187\u2014Action concerning split specimen test results. H\u2014Split Specimen Tests \u00a7 40.171 How does an employee request a test of a split specimen? (a) As an employee, when the MRO has notified you that you have a verified positive drug test or refusal to test because of adulteration or substi\u00adtution, you have 72 hours from the time of notification to request a test of the split specimen. The request may be verbal or in writing. If you make this request to the MRO within 72 hours, you trigger the requirements of this section for a test of the split specimen. 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) (b)(1) If, as an employee, you have not requested a test of the split speci\u00admen within 72 hours, you may present to the MRO information documenting that serious injury, illness, lack of ac\u00adtual notice of the verified test result, inability to contact the MRO (e.g., there was no one in the MRO's office and the answering machine was not working), or other circumstances un\u00adavoidably prevented you from making a timely request. (2) As the MRO, if you conclude from the employee's information that there was a legitimate reason for the em\u00adployee's failure to contact you within 72 hours, you must direct that the test of the split specimen take place, just as you would when there is a timely re-quest. (c) When the employee makes a time\u00ad ly request for a test of the split speci\u00admen under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, you must, as the MRO, immediately provide written notice to the laboratory that tested the primary specimen, directing the laboratory to forward the split specimen to a second HHS-certified laboratory. You must also document the date and time of the employee's request. \u00a7 40.173 Who is responsible for paying for the test of a split specimen? (a) As the employer, you are respon\u00ad sible for making sure (e.g., by estab\u00adlishing appropriate accounts with lab-oratories for testing split specimens) that the MRO, first laboratory, and second laboratory perform the func\u00adtions noted in \u00a7\u00a7 40.175-40.185 in a time\u00ad ly manner, once the employee has made a timely request for a test of the split specimen. (b) As the employer, you must not condition your compliance with these requirements on the employee's direct payment to the MRO or laboratory or the employee's agreement to reimburse you for the costs of testing. For exam\u00adple, if you ask the employee to pay for some or all of the cost of testing the split specimen, and the employee is un\u00adwilling or unable to do so, you must ensure that the test takes place in a timely manner, even though this means that you pay for it. (c) As the employer, you may seek payment or reimbursement of all or 620 Office of the Secretary of Transportation part of the cost of the split specimen from the employee (e.g., through your written company policy or a collective bargaining agreement). This part takes no position on who ultimately pays the cost of the test, so long as the em\u00adployer ensures that the testing is con\u00adducted as required and the results re-leased appropriately. \u00a7 40.175 What steps does the first lab- oratory take with a split specimen? (a) As the laboratory at which the primary and split specimen first arrive, you must check to see whether the split specimen is available for testing. (b) If the split specimen is unavail\u00ad able or appears insufficient, you must then do the following: (1) Continue the testing process for the primary specimen as you would normally. Report the results for the primary specimen without providing the MRO information regarding the un\u00adavailable split specimen. (2) Upon receiving a letter from the MRO instructing you to forward the split specimen to another laboratory for testing, report to the MRO that the split specimen is unavailable for test\u00ading. Provide as much information as you can about the cause of the unavail\u00adability. (c) As the laboratory that tested the primary specimen, you are not author\u00adized to open the split specimen under any circumstances (except when the split specimen is redesignated as pro\u00advided in \u00a7 40.83). (d) When you receive written notice from the MRO instructing you to send the split specimen to another HHS-cer\u00adtified laboratory, you must forward the following items to the second labora\u00adtory: (1) The split specimen in its original specimen bottle, with the seal intact; (2) A copy of the MRO's written re- quest; and (3) A copy of Copy 1 of the CCF, which identifies the drug(s)/metabo\u00adlite(s) or the validity criteria to be tested for. (e) You must not send to the second laboratory any information about the identity of the employee. Inadvertent disclosure does not, however, cause a fatal flaw. \u00a740.181 (f) This subpart does not prescribe who gets to decide which HHS-certified laboratory is used to test the split specimen. That decision is left to the parties involved. \u00a7 40.177 What does the second labora\u00ad tory do with the split specimen when it is tested to reconfirm the presence of a drug or drug metabo\u00ad lite? (a) As the laboratory testing the split specimen, you must test the split spec\u00ad imen for the drug(s)/drug metabolite(s) detected in the primary specimen. (b) You must conduct this test with- out regard to the cutoff concentrations of \u00a740.87 . (c) If the test fails to reconfirm the presence of the drug(s)/drug metabo\u00adlite(s) that were reported positive in the primary specimen, you must con- duct validity tests in an attempt to de\u00ad termine the reason for being unable to reconfirm the presence of the drug(s)/ metabolite(s). You should conduct the same validity tests as you would con- duct on a primary specimen set forth in \u00a740.91 . (d) In addition, if the test fails to re- confirm the presence of the drugs/drugs metabolites or validity criteria that were reported in the primary specimen, you may transmit the specimen or an aliquot of it to another HHS-certified laboratory that will conduct another reconfirmation test. \u00a7 40.179 What does the second labora\u00ad tory do with the split specimen when it is tested to reconfirm an adulterated test result? As the laboratory testing the split specimen, you must test the split spec\u00ad imen for the adulterant detected in the primary specimen, using the criteria of \u00a7 40.95 just as you would do for a pri\u00ad mary specimen. The result of the pri\u00ad mary specimen is reconfirmed if the split specimen meets these criteria. \u00a7 40.181 What does the second labora\u00ad tory do with the split specimen when it is tested to reconfirm a sub\u00ad stituted test result? As the laboratory testing the split specimen, you must test the split spec\u00ad imen using the criteria of \u00a7 40.93(b), just 621 \u00a740.183 as you would do for a primary speci\u00ad men. The result of the primary speci\u00admen is reconfirmed if the split speci\u00admen meets these criteria. \u00a7 40.183 What information do labora\u00ad tories report to MROs regarding split specimen results? (a) As the laboratory responsible for testing the split specimen, you must report split specimen test results by checking the ''Reconfirmed'' box or the ''Failed to Reconfirm'' box (Step 5(b)) on Copy 1 of the CCF. (b) If you check the ''Failed to Re- confirm'' box, one of the following statements must be included (as appro\u00adpriate) on the ''Reason'' line (Step 5(b)): (1) ''Drug(s)/Drug not found within cri\u00ad (3) ''Specimen not consistent with substitution criteria [specify creati\u00adnine, specific gravity, or both]'' (4) ''Specimen not available for test\u00ad ing.'' (c) As the laboratory certifying sci\u00ad entist, enter your name, sign, and date the CCF. \u00a7 40.185 Through what methods and to whom must a laboratory report split specimen results? (a) As the laboratory testing the split specimen, you must report laboratory results directly, and only, to the MRO at his or her place of business. You must not report results to or through the DER or another service agent (e.g., a C/TPA). (b) You must fax, courier, mail, or electronically transmit a legible image or copy of the fully-completed Copy 1 of the CCF, which has been signed by the certifying scientist. (c) You must transmit the laboratory result to the MRO immediately, pref\u00aderably on the same day or next busi\u00adness day as the result is signed and re-leased. \u00a7 40.187 What does the MRO do with split specimen laboratory results? As an MRO, you must take the fol\u00ad lowing actions when a laboratory re-ports the following results of split specimen tests: 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) (a) Reconfirmed. (1) In the case of a re- confirmed positive test for a drug or drug metabolite, report the recon\u00adfirmation to the DER and the em\u00adployee. (2) In the case of a reconfirmed adul\u00ad terated or substituted result, report to the DER and the employee that the specimen was adulterated or sub\u00adstituted, either of which constitutes a refusal to test. Therefore, ''refusal to test'' is the final result. (b) Failed to Reconfirm: Drug(s)/Drug Metabolite(s) Not Detected. (1) Report to the DER and the employee that both tests must be cancelled. (2) Using the format in Appendix D to this part, inform ODAPC of the failure to reconfirm. (c) Failed to Reconfirm: Adulteration or Substitution (as appropriate) Criteria Not Met. (1) Report to the DER and the em\u00ad ployee that both tests must be can-celled. (2) Using the format in Appendix D to this part, inform ODAPC of the failure to reconfirm. (d) Failed to Reconfirm: Specimen not Available for Testing. (1) Report to the DER and the employee that both tests must be cancelled and the reason for cancellation. (2) Direct the DER to ensure the im\u00ad mediate collection of another specimen from the employee under direct obser\u00advation, with no notice given to the em\u00adployee of this collection requirement until immediately before the collec\u00adtion. (3) Using the format in Appendix D to this part, notify ODAPC of the failure to reconfirm. (e) Failed to Reconfirm: Specimen Re\u00ad sults Invalid. (1) Report to the DER and the employee that both tests must be cancelled and the reason for cancella\u00adtion. (2) Direct the DER to ensure the im\u00ad mediate collection of another specimen from the employee under direct obser\u00advation, with no notice given to the em\u00adployee of this collection requirement until immediately before the collec\u00adtion. (3) Using the format in Appendix D to this part, notify ODAPC of the failure to reconfirm. (f) Failed to Reconfirm: Split Specimen Adulterated. (1) Contact the employee 622 Office of the Secretary of Transportation and inform the employee that the lab- oratory has determined that his or her split specimen is adulterated. (2) Follow the procedures of \u00a7 40.145 to determine if there is a legitimate med\u00adical explanation for the laboratory finding of adulteration. (3) If you determine that there is a legitimate medical explanation for the adulterated test result, report to the DER and the employee that the test is cancelled. Using the format in Appen\u00addix D to this part, notify ODAPC of the result. (4) If you determine that there is not a legitimate medical explanation for the adulterated test result, take the following steps: (i) Report the test to the DER and the employee as a verified refusal to test. Inform the employee that he or she has 72 hours to request a test of the primary specimen to determine if the adulterant found in the split specimen also is present in the primary speci\u00admen. (ii) Except that the request is for a test of the primary specimen and is being made to the laboratory that test\u00aded the primary specimen, follow the procedures of \u00a7\u00a7 40.153, 40.171, 40.173, 40.179, and 40.185. (iii) As the laboratory that tests the primary specimen to reconfirm the presence of the adulterant found in the split specimen, report your result to the MRO on a photocopy (faxed, mailed, scanned, couriered) of Copy 1 of the CCF . (iv) If the test of the primary speci\u00ad men reconfirms the adulteration find\u00ading of the split specimen, as the MRO you must report the test result as a re\u00adfusal as provided in \u00a7 40.187(a)(2). (v) If the test of the primary speci\u00ad men fails to reconfirm the adulteration finding of the split specimen, as the MRO you cancel the test. Follow the procedures of paragraph (e) of this sec\u00adtion in this situation. (g) Enter your name, sign and date (Step 7) of Copy 2 of the CCF. (h) Send a legible copy of Copy 2 of the CCF (or a signed and dated letter, see \u00a7 40.163 ) to the employer and keep a copy for your records. Transmit the document as provided in \u00a7 40.167.

Subpart I\u2014Problems in Drug Tests \u00a7 40.191 What is a refusal to take a DOT drug test, and what are the consequences? (a) As an employee, you have refused to take a drug test if you: (1) Fail to appear for any test (except a pre-employment test) within a rea\u00ad sonable time, as determined by the em\u00adployer, consistent with applicable DOT agency regulations, after being di\u00adrected to do so by the employer. This includes the failure of an employee (in\u00adcluding an owner-operator) to appear for a test when called by a C/TPA (see \u00a740.61(a)); (2) Fail to remain at the testing site until the testing process is complete; Pro\u00advided, That an employee who leaves the testing site before the testing process commences (see \u00a7 40.63 (c)) for a pre-em\u00ad ployment test is not deemed to have refused to test; (3) Fail to provide a urine specimen for any drug test required by this part or DOT agency regulations; Provided, That an employee who does not provide a urine specimen because he or she has left the testing site before the testing process commences (see \u00a7 40.63 (c)) for a pre-employment test is not deemed to have refused to test; (4) In the case of a directly observed or monitored collection in a drug test, 623 \u00a740.193 fail to permit the observation or moni\u00ad toring of your provision of a specimen (see \u00a7\u00a7 40.67(l) and 40.69(g)); (5) Fail to provide a sufficient amount of urine when directed, and it has been determined, through a re\u00adquired medical evaluation, that there was no adequate medical explanation for the failure (see \u00a7 40.193(d)(2)); (6) Fail or decline to take a second test the employer or collector has di\u00adrected you to take; (7) Fail to undergo a medical exam\u00ad ination or evaluation, as directed by the MRO as part of the verification process, or as directed by the DER under \u00a7 40.193(d). In the case of a pre- employment drug test, the employee is deemed to have refused to test on this basis only if the pre-employment test is conducted following a contingent offer of employment; or (8) Fail to cooperate with any part of the testing process (e.g., refuse to empty pockets when so directed by the collector, behave in a confrontational way that disrupts the collection proc\u00adess). (b) As an employee, if the MRO re- ports that you have a verified adulter\u00adated or substituted test result, you have refused to take a drug test. (c) As an employee, if you refuse to take a drug test, you incur the con-sequences specified under DOT agency regulations for a violation of those DOT agency regulations. (d) As a collector or an MRO, when an employee refuses to participate in the part of the testing process in which you are involved, you must terminate the portion of the testing process in which you are involved, document the refusal on the CCF (including, in the case of the collector, printing the em\u00adployee's name on Copy 2 of the CCF), immediately notify the DER by any means (e.g., telephone or secure fax machine) that ensures that the refusal notification is immediately received. As a referral physician (e.g., physician evaluating a ''shy bladder'' condition or a claim of a legitimate medical ex-planation in a validity testing situa\u00adtion), you must notify the MRO, who in turn will notify the DER. (1) As the collector, you must note the refusal in the ''Remarks'' line (Step 2), and sign and date the CCF. 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) (2) As the MRO, you must note the refusal by checking the ''refused to test because'' box (Step 6) on Copy 2 of the CCF, and add the reason on the ''Remarks'' line. You must then sign and date the CCF. (e) As an employee, when you refuse to take a non-DOT test or to sign a non-DOT form, you have not refused to take a DOT test. There are no con-sequences under DOT agency regula\u00adtions for refusing to take a non-DOT test. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as 66 FR 41953, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.193 What happens when an em\u00ad ployee does not provide a sufficient amount of urine for a drug test? (a) This section prescribes procedures for situations in which an employee does not provide a sufficient amount of urine to permit a drug test (i.e., 45 mL of urine). (b) As the collector, you must do the following: (1) Discard the insufficient specimen, except where the insufficient specimen was out of temperature range or showed evidence of adulteration or tampering (see \u00a7 40.65(b) and (c)). (2) Urge the employee to drink up to 40 ounces of fluid, distributed reason-ably through a period of up to three hours, or until the individual has pro\u00advided a sufficient urine specimen, whichever occurs first. It is not a re\u00adfusal to test if the employee declines to drink. Document on the Remarks line of the CCF (Step 2), and inform the em\u00adployee of, the time at which the three-hour period begins and ends. (3) If the employee refuses to make the attempt to provide a new urine specimen or leaves the collection site before the collection process is com\u00adplete, you must discontinue the collec\u00adtion, note the fact on the ''Remarks'' line of the CCF (Step 2), and imme\u00addiately notify the DER. This is a re\u00adfusal to test. (4) If the employee has not provided a sufficient specimen within three hours of the first unsuccessful attempt to provide the specimen, you must dis\u00adcontinue the collection, note the fact on the ''Remarks'' line of the CCF (Step 2), and immediately notify the DER. 624 Office of the Secretary of Transportation (5) Send Copy 2 of the CCF to the MRO and Copy 4 to the DER. You must send or fax these copies to the MRO and DER within 24 hours or the next business day. (c) As the DER, when the collector informs you that the employee has not provided a sufficient amount of urine (see paragraph (b)(4) of this section), you must, after consulting with the MRO, direct the employee to obtain, within five days, an evaluation from a licensed physician, acceptable to the MRO, who has expertise in the medical issues raised by the employee's failure to provide a sufficient specimen. (The MRO may perform this evaluation if the MRO has appropriate expertise.) (1) As the MRO, if another physician will perform the evaluation, you must provide the other physician with the following information and instructions: (i) That the employee was required to take a DOT drug test, but was unable to provide a sufficient amount of urine to complete the test; (ii) The consequences of the appro\u00ad priate DOT agency regulation for refus\u00ad ing to take the required drug test; (iii) That the referral physician must agree to follow the requirements of paragraphs (d) through (g) of this sec\u00ad tion. (2) [Reserved] (d) As the referral physician con\u00ad ducting this evaluation, you must rec\u00ad ommend that the MRO make one of the following determinations: (1) A medical condition has, or with a high degree of probability could have, precluded the employee from providing a sufficient amount of urine. As the MRO, if you accept this recommenda\u00ad tion, you must: (i) Check ''Test Cancelled'' (Step 6) on the CCF; and (ii) Sign and date the CCF. (2) There is not an adequate basis for determining that a medical condition has, or with a high degree of prob\u00ad ability could have, precluded the em\u00adployee from providing a sufficient amount of urine. As the MRO, if you accept this recommendation, you must: (i) Check ''Refusal to test because'' (Step 6) on the CCF and enter reason in the remarks line; and (ii) Sign and date the CCF. (e) For purposes of this paragraph, a medical condition includes an ascer-\u00a740.195 tainable physiological condition (e.g., a urinary system dysfunction) or a medi\u00ad cally documented pre-existing psycho-logical disorder, but does not include unsupported assertions of ''situational anxiety'' or dehydration. (f) As the referral physician making the evaluation, after completing your evaluation, you must provide a written statement of your recommendations and the basis for them to the MRO. You must not include in this statement detailed information on the employee's medical condition beyond what is nec\u00adessary to explain your conclusion. (g) If, as the referral physician mak\u00ad ing this evaluation in the case of a pre-employment test, you determine that the employee's medical condition is a serious and permanent or long-term disability that is highly likely to pre- vent the employee from providing a sufficient amount of urine for a very long or indefinite period of time, you must set forth your determination and the reasons for it in your written state\u00ad ment to the MRO. As the MRO, upon receiving such a report, you must fol\u00adlow the requirements of \u00a7 40.195, where applicable. (h) As the MRO, you must seriously consider and assess the referral physi\u00ad cian's recommendations in making your determination about whether the employee has a medical condition that has, or with a high degree of prob\u00ad ability could have, precluded the em\u00adployee from providing a sufficient amount of urine. You must report your determination to the DER in writing as soon as you make it. (i) As the employer, when you receive a report from the MRO indicating that a test is cancelled as provided in para- graph (d)(1) of this section, you take no further action with respect to the em\u00ad ployee. The employee remains in the random testing pool. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41953, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.195 What happens when indi\u00ad vidual is unable to provide a suffi\u00ad cient amount of urine for a pre-em\u00ad ployment follow-up or return-to- duty test because of a permanent or long-term medical condition? (a) This section concerns a situation in which an employee has a medical 625 \u00a740.197 condition that precludes him or her from providing a sufficient specimen for a pre-employment follow-up or re-turn-to-duty test and the condition in\u00advolves a permanent or long-term dis\u00adability. As the MRO in this situation, you must do the following: (1) You must determine if there is clinical evidence that the individual is an illicit drug user. You must make this determination by personally con\u00adducting, or causing to be conducted, a medical evaluation and through con\u00adsultation with the employee's physi\u00adcian and/or the physician who con\u00adducted the evaluation under \u00a7 40.193(d). (2) If you do not personally conduct the medical evaluation, you must en-sure that one is conducted by a li\u00adcensed physician acceptable to you. (3) For purposes of this section, the MRO or the physician conducting the evaluation may conduct an alternative test (e.g., blood) as part of the medi\u00ad cally appropriate procedures in deter-mining clinical evidence of drug use. (b) If the medical evaluation reveals no clinical evidence of drug use, as the MRO, you must report the result to the employer as a negative test with writ-ten notations regarding results of both the evaluation conducted under \u00a7 40.193(d) and any further medical ex\u00ad amination. This report must state the basis for the determination that a per\u00admanent or long-term medical condition exists, making provision of a sufficient urine specimen impossible, and for the determination that no signs and symp\u00adtoms of drug use exist. (1) Check ''Negative'' (Step 6) on the CCF. (2) Sign and date the CCF. (c) If the medical evaluation reveals clinical evidence of drug use, as the MRO, you must report the result to the employer as a cancelled test with writ-ten notations regarding results of both the evaluation conducted under \u00a7 40.193(d) and any further medical ex\u00ad amination. This report must state that a permanent or long-term medical con\u00addition exists, making provision of a sufficient urine specimen impossible, and state the reason for the determina\u00adtion that signs and symptoms of drug use exist. Because this is a cancelled test, it does not serve the purposes of a negative test (i.e., the employer is not 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) authorized to allow the employee to begin or resume performing safety-sen\u00ad sitive functions, because a negative test is needed for that purpose). (d) For purposes of this section, per\u00ad manent or long-term medical condi\u00adtions are those physiological, ana\u00ad tomic, or psychological abnormalities documented as being present prior to the attempted collection, and consid\u00adered not amenable to correction or cure for an extended period of time, if ever. (1) Examples would include destruc\u00ad tion (any cause) of the glomerular fil\u00ad tration system leading to renal failure; unrepaired traumatic disruption of the urinary tract; or a severe psychiatric disorder focused on genito-urinary matters. (2) Acute or temporary medical con\u00ad ditions, such as cystitis, urethritis or prostatitis, though they might inter\u00ad fere with collection for a limited period of time, cannot receive the same excep\u00ad tional consideration as the permanent or long-term conditions discussed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41953, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.197 What happens when em\u00ad ployer receives a report of a dilute specimen? (a) As the employer, if the MRO in- forms you that a positive drug test was dilute, you simply treat the test as a verified positive test. You must not di\u00ad rect the employee to take another test based on the fact that the specimen was dilute. (b) If the MRO informs you that a negative drug test was dilute, you may, but are not required to, direct the em\u00ad ployee to take another test imme\u00ad diately. Such recollections must not be collected under direct observation, un\u00adless there is another basis for use of di\u00ad rect observation (see \u00a7 40.67(b) and (c)). (c) You must treat all employees the same for this purpose. For example, you must not retest some employees and not others. You may, however, es\u00ad tablish different policies for different types of tests (e.g., conduct retests in pre-employment test situations, but not in random test situations). You 626 Office of the Secretary of Transportation must inform your employees in ad\u00ad vance of your decisions on these mat\u00ad ters. (d) If you direct the employee to take another test, you must ensure that the employee is given the minimum pos\u00ad sible advance notice that he or she must go to the collection site. (e) If you direct the employee to take another test, the result of the second test\u2014not that of the original test\u2014be\u00ad comes the test of record, on which you rely for purposes of this part. (f) If you require employees to take another test, and the second test is also negative and dilute, you are not permitted to make the employee take a third test because the second test was dilute. (g) If you direct the employee to take another test and the employee declines to do so, the employee has refused the test for purpose of this part and DOT agency regulations. \u00a7 40.199 What problems always cause a drug test to be cancelled? (a) As the MRO, when the laboratory discovers a ''fatal flaw'' during its processing of incoming specimens (see \u00a7 40.83), the laboratory will report to you that the specimen has been ''Re\u00ad jected for Testing'' (with the reason stated). You must always cancel such a test. (b) The following are ''fatal flaws'': (1) There is no printed collector's name and no collector's signature; (2) The specimen ID numbers on the specimen bottle and the CCF do not match; (3) The specimen bottle seal is broken or shows evidence of tampering (and a split specimen cannot be redesignated, see \u00a7 40.83(g)); and (4) Because of leakage or other causes, there is an insufficient amount of urine in the primary specimen bottle for analysis and the specimens cannot be redesignated (see \u00a7 40.83(g)). (c) You must report in \u00a7 40.161 . \u00a7 40.201 What problems always cause a drug test to be cancelled and may result in a requirement for another collection? As the MRO, you must cancel a drug test when a laboratory reports that any of the following problems have oc-\u00a740.203 curred. You must inform the DER that the test was cancelled. You must also direct the DER to ensure that an addi\u00adtional collection occurs immediately, if required by the applicable procedures specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. (a) The laboratory reports an ''In- valid Result.'' You must follow applica\u00adble procedures in \u00a7 40.159 (recollection under direct observation may be re\u00adquired). (b) The laboratory reports the result as ''Rejected for Testing.'' You must follow applicable procedures in \u00a7 40.161 (a recollection may be required). (c) The laboratory's test of the pri\u00ad mary specimen is positive and the split specimen is reported by the laboratory as ''Failure to Reconfirm: Drug(s)/Drug Metabolite(s) Not Detected.'' You must follow applicable procedures in \u00a7 40.187(b) (no recollection is required in this case). (d) The laboratory's test result for the primary specimen is adulterated or substituted and the split specimen is reported by the laboratory as ''Adulterant not found within cri\u00adteria,'' or '' specimen not consistent with substitution criteria, as applica\u00adble. You must follow applicable proce\u00addures in \u00a7 40.187(c) (no recollection is required in this case). (e) The laboratory's test of the pri\u00ad mary specimen is positive, adulterated, or substituted and the split specimen is unavailable for testing. You must fol\u00adlow applicable procedures in \u00a7 40.187(d) (recollection under direct observation is required in this case). (f) The examining physician has de\u00ad termined that there is an acceptable medical explanation of the employee's failure to provide a sufficient amount of urine. You must follow applicable procedures in \u00a7 40.193(d)(1) (no recollec\u00ad tion is required in this case). \u00a7 40.203 What problems cause a drug test to be cancelled unless they are corrected? (a) As the MRO, when a laboratory discovers a ''correctable flaw'' during its processing of incoming specimens (see \u00a7 40.83), the laboratory will at- tempt to correct it. If the laboratory is unsuccessful in this attempt, it will re-port to you that the specimen has been 627 \u00a740.205 ''Rejected for Testing'' (with the rea\u00ad son stated). (b) The following is a ''correctable flaw'' that laboratories must attempt to correct: The collector's signature is omitted on the certification statement on the CCF. (c) As the MRO, when you discover a ''correctable flaw'' during your review of the CCF, you must cancel the test unless the flaw is corrected. (d) The following are correctable flaws that you must attempt to cor\u00ad rect: (1) The employee's signature is omit\u00ad ted from the certification statement, unless the employee's failure or refusal to sign is noted on the ''Remarks'' line of the CCF. (2) The certifying scientist's signa\u00ad ture is omitted on the laboratory copy of the CCF for a positive, adulterated, substituted, or invalid test result. (3) The collector uses a non-Federal form or an expired Federal form for the test. This flaw may be corrected through the procedure set forth in \u00a7 40.205(b)(2), provided that the collec\u00ad tion testing process has been conducted in accordance with the procedures of this part in an HHS-certified labora\u00adtory. During the period August 1-Octo-ber 31, 2001, you are not required to cancel a test because of the use of an expired Federal form. Beginning No\u00advember 1, 2001, if the problem is not corrected, you must cancel the test. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41954, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.205 How are drug test problems corrected? (a) As a collector, you have the re\u00ad sponsibility of trying to successfully complete a collection procedure for each employee. (1) If, during or shortly after the col\u00ad lection process, you become aware of any event that prevents the completion of a valid test or collection (e.g., a pro\u00ad cedural or paperwork error), you must try to correct the problem promptly, if doing so is practicable. You may con-duct another collection as part of this effort. (2) If another collection is necessary, you must begin the new collection pro\u00adcedure as soon as possible, using a new CCF and a new collection kit. 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) (b) If, as a collector, laboratory, MRO, employer, or other person imple\u00admenting these drug testing regula\u00adtions, you become aware of a problem that can be corrected (see \u00a7 40.203 ), but which has not already been corrected under paragraph (a) of this section, you must take all practicable action to cor\u00adrect the problem so that the test is not cancelled. (1) If the problem resulted from the omission of required information, you must, as the person responsible for pro\u00adviding that information, supply in writing the missing information and a statement that it is true and accurate. For example, suppose you are a col\u00adlector, and you forgot to make a nota\u00adtion on the ''Remarks'' line of the CCF that the employee did not sign the cer\u00adtification. You would, when the prob\u00adlem is called to your attention, supply a signed statement that the employee failed or refused to sign the certifi\u00adcation and that your statement is true and accurate. You must supply this in-formation on the same business day on which you are notified of the problem, transmitting it by fax or courier. (2) If the problem is the use of a non- Federal form or an expired Federal form, you must provide a signed state\u00adment (i.e., a memorandum for the record). It must state that the incor\u00adrect form contains all the information needed for a valid DOT drug test, and that the incorrect form was used inad\u00advertently or as the only means of con\u00adducting a test, in circumstances be\u00adyond your control. The statement must also list the steps you have taken to prevent future use of non-Federal forms or expired Federal forms for DOT tests. For this flaw to be corrected, the test of the specimen must have oc\u00adcurred at a HHS-certified laboratory where it was tested consistent with the requirements of this part. You must supply this information on the same business day on which you are notified of the problem, transmitting it by fax or courier. (3) You must maintain the written documentation of a correction with the CCF. (4) You must mark the CCF in such a way (e.g., stamp noting correction) as to make it obvious on the face of the CCF that you corrected the flaw. 628 Office of the Secretary of Transportation (c) If the correction does not take place, as the MRO you must cancel the test. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41954, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.207 What is the effect of a can- celled drug test? (a) A cancelled drug test is neither positive nor negative. (1) As an employer, you must not at- tach to a cancelled test the con- sequences of a positive test or other violation of a DOT drug testing regula\u00adtion (e.g., removal from a safety-sen\u00ad sitive position). (2) As an employer, you must not use a cancelled test for the purposes of a negative test to authorize the em\u00adployee to perform safety-sensitive functions (i.e., in the case of a pre-em\u00ad ployment, return-to-duty, or follow-up test). (3) However, as an employer, you must not direct a recollection for an employee because a test has been can-celled, except in the situations cited in paragraph (a)(2) of this section or other provisions of this part that require an-other test to be conducted (e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 40.159(a)(5) and 40.187(b)). (b) A cancelled test does not count toward compliance with DOT require\u00adments (e.g., being applied toward the number of tests needed to meet the em\u00adployer's minimum random testing rate). (c) A cancelled DOT test does not provide a valid basis for an employer to conduct a non-DOT test (i.e., a test under company authority). \u00a7 40.208 What problem requires correc\u00ad tive action but does not result in the cancellation of a test? (a) If, as a laboratory, collector, em\u00ad ployer, or other person implementing the DOT drug testing program, you be-come aware that the specimen tem\u00adperature on the CCF was not checked and the ''Remarks'' line did not con\u00ad tain an entry regarding the tempera\u00adture being out of range, you must take corrective action, including securing a memorandum for the record explaining the problem and taking appropriate ac\u00adtion to ensure that the problem does not recur. \u00a740.209 (b) This error does not result in the cancellation of the test. (c) As an employer or service agent, this error, even though not sufficient to cancel a drug test result, may sub\u00ad ject you to enforcement action under DOT agency regulations or Subpart R of this part. [66 FR 41954, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.209 What procedural problems do not result in the cancellation of a test and do not require collection? (a) As a collector, laboratory, MRO, employer or other person admin\u00ad istering the drug testing process, you must document any errors in the test\u00ading process of which you become aware, even if they are not considered prob\u00adlems that will cause a test to be can-celled as listed in this subpart. Deci\u00adsions about the ultimate impact of these errors will be determined by other administrative or legal pro\u00adceedings, subject to the limitations of paragraph (b) of this section. (b) No person concerned with the testing process may declare a test can-celled based on an error that does not have a significant adverse effect on the right of the employee to have a fair and accurate test. Matters that do not result in the cancellation of a test in\u00adclude, but are not limited to, the fol\u00adlowing: (1) A minor administrative mistake (e.g., the omission of the employee's middle initial, a transposition of num\u00adbers in the employee's social security number); (2) An error that does not affect em\u00ad ployee protections under this part (e.g., the collector's failure to add bluing agent to the toilet bowl, which ad\u00adversely affects only the ability of the collector to detect tampering with the specimen by the employee); (3) The collection of a specimen by a collector who is required to have been trained (see \u00a7 40.33), but who has not met this requirement; (4) A delay in the collection process (see \u00a7 40.61(a)); (5) Verification of a test result by an MRO who has the basic credentials to be qualified as an MRO (see \u00a7 40.121(a) through (b)) but who has not met train\u00ading and/or documentation requirements (see \u00a7 40.121(c) through (e)); 629 \u00a740.211 (6) The failure to directly observe or monitor a collection that the rule re- quires or permits to be directly ob\u00ad served or monitored, or the unauthor\u00adized use of direct observation or moni\u00ad toring for a collection; (7) The fact that a test was conducted in a facility that does not meet the re\u00adquirements of \u00a7 40.41; (8) If the specific name of the courier on the CCF is omitted or erroneous; (9) Personal identifying information is inadvertently contained on the CCF (e.g., the employee signs his or her name on the laboratory copy); or (10) Claims that the employee was improperly selected for testing. (c) As an employer or service agent, these types of errors, even though not sufficient to cancel a drug test result, may subject you to enforcement action under DOT agency regulations or ac\u00ad tion under Subpart R of this part. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 Aug. 9, 2001] Subpart J\u2014Alcohol Testing Personnel \u00a7 40.211 Who conducts DOT alcohol tests? (a) Screening test technicians (STTs) and breath alcohol technicians (BATs) meeting their respective requirements of this subpart are the only people au\u00adthorized to conduct DOT alcohol tests. (b) An STT can conduct only alcohol screening tests, but a BAT can conduct alcohol screening and confirmation tests. (c) As a BAT- or STT-qualified imme\u00ad diate supervisor of a particular em\u00ad ployee, you may not act as the STT or BAT when that employee is tested, un\u00adless no other STT or BAT is available and DOT agency regulations do not prohibit you from doing so. \u00a7 40.213 What training requirements must STTs and BATs meet? To be permitted to act as a BAT or STT in the DOT alcohol testing pro-gram, you must meet each of the re\u00adquirements of this section: (a) Basic information. You must be knowledgeable about the alcohol test\u00ading procedures in this part and the cur-rent DOT guidance. These documents and information are available from 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) ODAPC (Department of Transpor\u00adtation, 400 7th Street, SW., Room 10403, Washington DC, 20590, 202-366-3784, or on the ODAPC web site, http:// www.dot.gov/ost/dapc)). (b) Qualification training. You must receive qualification training meeting the requirements of this paragraph (b). (1) Qualification training must be in accordance with the DOT Model BAT or STT Course, as applicable. The DOT Model Courses are available from ODAPC (Department of Transpor\u00adtation, 400 7th Street, SW., Room 10403, Washington DC, 20590, 202-366-3784, or on the ODAPC web site, http:// www.dot.gov/ost/dapc). The training can also be provided using a course of instruction equivalent to the DOT Model Courses. On request, ODAPC will review BAT and STT instruction courses for equivalency. (2) Qualification training must in\u00ad clude training to proficiency in using the alcohol testing procedures of this part and in the operation of the par\u00adticular alcohol testing device(s) (i.e., the ASD(s) or EBT(s)) you will be using. (3) The training must emphasize that you are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the testing process, ensur\u00ading the privacy of employees being tested, and avoiding conduct or state\u00adments that could be viewed as offensive or inappropriate. (4) The instructor must be an indi\u00ad vidual who has demonstrated necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities by reg\u00adularly conducting DOT alcohol tests as an STT or BAT, as applicable, for a pe\u00adriod of at least a year, who has con\u00adducted STT or BAT training, as appli\u00adcable, under this part for a year, or who has successfully completed a ''train the trainer'' course. (c) Initial Proficiency Demonstration. Following your completion of quali\u00adfication training under paragraph (b) of this section, you must demonstrate proficiency in alcohol testing under this part by completing seven consecu\u00adtive error-free mock tests (BATs) or five consecutive error-free tests (STTs). (1) Another person must monitor and evaluate your performance, in person or by a means that provides real-time observation and interaction between 630 Office of the Secretary of Transportation the instructor and trainee, and attest in writing that the mock collections are ''error-free.'' This person must be an individual who meets the require\u00ad ments of paragraph (b)(4) of this sec\u00ad tion. (2) These tests must use the alcohol testing devices (e.g., EBT(s) or ASD(s)) that you will use as a BAT or STT. (3) If you are an STT who will be using an ASD that indicates readings by changes, contrasts, or other read\u00ad ings in color, you must demonstrate as part of the mock test that you are able to discern changes, contrasts, or read\u00ad ings correctly. (d) Schedule for qualification training and initial proficiency demonstration. The following is the schedule for quali\u00ad fication training and the initial pro\u00adficiency demonstration you must meet: (1) If you became a BAT or STT be- fore August 1, 2001, you were required to have met the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this sec\u00adtion, and you do not have to meet them again. (2) If you become a BAT or STT on or after August 1, 2001, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section before you begin to per-form BAT or STT functions. (e) Refresher training. No less fre\u00ad quently than every five years from the date on which you satisfactorily com\u00adplete the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, you must complete refresher training that meets all the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. If you are a BAT or STT who completed qualification training before January 1, 1998, you are not required to complete refresher training until January 1, 2003. (f) Error Correction Training. If you make a mistake in the alcohol testing process that causes a test to be can-celled (i.e., a fatal or uncorrected flaw), you must undergo error correction training. This training must occur within 30 days of the date you are noti\u00adfied of the error that led to the need for retraining. (1) Error correction training must be provided and your proficiency docu\u00admented in writing by a person who meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section. \u00a740.215 (2) Error correction training is re\u00ad quired to cover only the subject matter area(s) in which the error that caused the test to be cancelled occurred. (3) As part of the error correction training, you must demonstrate your proficiency in the alcohol testing pro\u00ad cedures of this part by completing three consecutive error-free mock tests. The mock tests must include one uneventful scenario and two scenarios related to the area(s) in which your error(s) occurred. The person providing the training must monitor and evalu\u00ad ate your performance and attest in writing that the mock tests were error- free. (g) Documentation. You must main\u00ad tain documentation showing that you currently meet all requirements of this section. You must provide this docu\u00admentation on request to DOT agency representatives and to employers and C/TPAs who are negotiating to use your services. (h) Other persons who may serve as BATs or STTs. (1) Anyone meeting the requirements of this section to be a BAT may act as an STT, provided that the individual has demonstrated initial proficiency in the operation of the ASD that he or she is using, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. (2) Law enforcement officers who have been certified by state or local governments to conduct breath alcohol testing are deemed to be qualified as BATs. They are not required to also complete the training requirements of this section in order to act as BATs. In order for a test conducted by such an officer to be accepted under DOT alco\u00adhol testing requirements, the officer must have been certified by a state or local government to use the EBT or ASD that was used for the test. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41954, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.215 What information about the DER do employers have to provide to BATs and STTs? As an employer, you must provide to the STTs and BATs the name and tele\u00ad phone number of the appropriate DER (and C/TPA, where applicable) to con-tact about any problems or issues that may arise during the testing process. 631 \u00a740.217 \u00a7 40.217 Where is other information on the role of STTs and BATs found in this regulation? You can find other information on the role and functions of STTs and BATs in the following sections of this part: \u00a740.3\u2014Definitions. \u00a7 40.223\u2014Responsibility for supervising em\u00ad ployees of the alcohol testing 40.241-40.245\u2014Screening 40.267\u2014Problems requiring cancellation of tests. \u00a7\u00a7 40.269-40.271\u2014Correcting problems in tests. Subpart K\u2014Testing Sites, Forms, Equipment and Supplies Used in Alcohol Testing \u00a7 40.221 Where does an alcohol test take place? (a) A DOT alcohol test must take place at an alcohol testing site meeting the requirements of this section. (b) If you are operating an alcohol testing site, you must ensure that it meets the security requirements of \u00a740.223. (c) If you are operating an alcohol testing site, you must ensure that it provides visual and aural privacy to the employee being tested, sufficient to prevent unauthorized persons from see\u00ad ing or hearing test results. (d) If you are operating an alcohol testing site, you must ensure that it has all needed personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities to provide for the collection and analysis of breath and/or saliva samples, and a suitable clean surface for writing. (e) If an alcohol testing site fully meeting all the visual and aural pri\u00advacy requirements of paragraph (c) is not readily available, this part allows a reasonable suspicion or post-accident test to be conducted at a site that par\u00adtially meets these requirements. In this case, the site must afford visual and aural privacy to the employee to the greatest extent practicable. (f) An alcohol testing site can be in a medical facility, a mobile facility (e.g., 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) a van), a dedicated collection facility, or any other location meeting the re\u00adquirements of this section. \u00a7 40.223 What steps must be taken to protect the security of alcohol test\u00ad ing sites? (a) If you are a BAT, STT, or other person operating an alcohol testing site, you must prevent unauthorized personnel from entering the testing site. (1) The only people you are to treat as authorized persons are employees being tested, BATs, STTs, and other al\u00adcohol testing site workers, DERs, em\u00adployee representatives authorized by the employer (e.g., on the basis of em\u00ad ployer policy or labor-management agreement), and DOT agency represent\u00adatives. (2) You must ensure that all persons are under the supervision of a BAT or STT at all times when permitted into the site. (3) You may remove any person who obstructs, interferes with, or causes unnecessary delay in the testing proc\u00adess. (b) As the BAT or STT, you must not allow any person other than you, the employee, or a DOT agency representa\u00adtive to actually witness the testing process (see \u00a7\u00a7 40.241-40.255). (c) If you are operating an alcohol testing site, you must ensure that when an EBT or ASD is not being used for testing, you store it in a secure place. (d) If you are operating an alcohol testing site, you must ensure that no one other than BATs or other employ\u00adees of the site have access to the site when an EBT is unsecured. (e) As a BAT or STT, to avoid dis\u00ad traction that could compromise secu\u00adrity, you are limited to conducting an alcohol test for only one employee at a time. (1) When an EBT screening test on an employee indicates an alcohol con\u00adcentration of 0.02 or higher, and the same EBT will be used for the con\u00adfirmation test, you are not allowed to use the EBT for a test on another em\u00adployee before completing the confirma\u00adtion test on the first employee. (2) As a BAT who will conduct both the screening and the confirmation 632 Office of the Secretary of Transportation test, you are to complete the entire screening and confirmation process on one employee before starting the screening process on another employee. (3) You are not allowed to leave the alcohol testing site while the testing process for a given employee is in progress, except to notify a supervisor or contact a DER for assistance in the case an employee or other person who obstructs, interferes with, or unneces\u00adsarily delays the testing process. \u00a7 40.225 What form is used for an alco\u00ad hol test? (a) The DOT Alcohol Testing Form (ATF) must be used for every DOT al\u00ad cohol test beginning February 1, 2002. The ATF must be a three-part carbonless manifold form. The ATF is found in Appendix G to this part. You may view this form on the ODAPC web site (http://www.dot.gov/ost/dapc). (b) As an employer in the DOT alco\u00ad hol testing program, you are not per\u00admitted to modify or revise the ATF ex\u00adcept as follows: (1) You may include other informa\u00ad tion needed for billing purposes, out-side the boundaries of the form. (2) You may use a ATF directly gen\u00ad erated by an EBT which omits the space for affixing a separate printed re\u00adsult to the ATF, provided the EBT prints the result directly on the ATF. (3) You may use an ATF that has the employer's name, address, and tele\u00ad phone number preprinted. In addition, a C/TPA's name, address, and telephone number may be included, to assist with negative results. (4) You may use an ATF in which all pages are printed on white paper. You may modify the ATF by using colored paper, or have clearly discernable bor\u00adders or designation statements on Copy 2 and Copy 3. When colors are used, they must be green for Copy 2 and blue for Copy 3. (5) As a BAT or STT, you may add, on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF, the name of the DOT agency under whose authority the test occurred. (6) As a BAT or STT, you may use a ATF that has your name, address, and telephone number preprinted, but under no circumstances can your sig\u00adnature be preprinted. \u00a740.231 (c) As an employer, you may use an equivalent foreign-language version of the ATF approved by ODAPC. You may use such a non-English language form only in a situation where both the em\u00adployee and BAT/STT understand and can use the form in that language. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41954, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.227 May employers use the ATF for non-DOT tests, or non-DOT forms for DOT tests? (a) No, as an employer, BAT, or STT, you are prohibited from using the ATF for non-DOT alcohol tests. You are also prohibited from using non-DOT forms for DOT alcohol tests. Doing either subjects you to enforcement action under DOT agency regulations. (b) If the STT or BAT, either by mis\u00ad take, or as the only means to conduct a test under difficult circumstances (e.g., post-accident test with insuffi\u00ad cient time to obtain the ATF), uses a non-DOT form for a DOT test, the use of a non-DOT form does not, in and of itself, require the employer or service agent to cancel the test. However, in order for the test to be considered valid, a signed statement must be ob\u00adtained from the STT or BAT in accord\u00adance with \u00a7 40.271(b) . \u00a7 40.229 What duct alcohol screening tests? EBTs and ASDs on the NHTSA con- forming products lists (CPL) for evi\u00addential and non-evidential devices are the only devices you are allowed to use to conduct alcohol screening tests under this part. You may use an ASD that is on the NHTSA CPL for DOT al\u00adcohol tests only if there are instruc\u00adtions for its use in this part. An ASD can be used only for screening tests for alcohol, and may not be used for con\u00adfirmation tests. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as 66 FR 41954, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.231 What devices are used to con- duct alcohol confirmation tests? (a) EBTs on the NHTSA CPL for evi\u00ad dential devices that meet the require\u00ad ments of paragraph (b) of this section are the only devices you may use to conduct alcohol confirmation tests 633 \u00a740.233 under this part. Note that, among de- vices on the CPL for EBTs, only those devices listed without an asterisk (*) are authorized for use in confirmation testing in the DOT alcohol testing pro-gram. (b) To conduct a confirmation test, you must use an EBT that has the fol\u00adlowing capabilities: (1) Provides a printed triplicate re\u00ad sult (or three consecutive identical copies of a result) of each breath test; (2) Assigns a unique number to each completed test, which the BAT and em\u00adployee can read before each test and which is printed on each copy of the re\u00adsult; (3) Prints, on each copy of the result, the manufacturer's name for the de-vice, its serial number, and the time of the test; (4) Distinguishes alcohol from ace- tone at the 0.02 alcohol concentration level; (5) Tests an air blank; and (6) Performs an external calibration check. \u00a7 40.233 What are the requirements for proper use and care of EBTs? (a) As an EBT manufacturer, you must submit, for NHTSA approval, a quality assurance plan (QAP) for your EBT before NHTSA places the EBT on the CPL. (1) Your QAP must specify the meth\u00ad ods used to perform external calibra\u00adtion checks on the EBT, the tolerances within which the EBT is regarded as being in proper calibration, and the in\u00adtervals at which these checks must be performed. In designating these inter\u00advals, your QAP must take into account factors like frequency of use, environ\u00admental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, altitude) and type of oper\u00adation (e.g., stationary or mobile). (2) Your QAP must also specify the inspection, maintenance, and calibra\u00adtion requirements and intervals for the EBT. (b) As the manufacturer, you must include, with each EBT, instructions for its use and care consistent with the QAP. (c) As the user of the EBT (e.g., em\u00ad ployer, service agent), you must do the following: 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) (1) You must follow the manufactur\u00ad er's instructions (see paragraph (b) of this section), including performance of external calibration checks at the in\u00adtervals the instructions specify. (2) In conducting external calibration checks, you must use only calibration devices appearing on NHTSA's CPL for ''Calibrating Units for Breath Alcohol Tests.'' (3) If an EBT fails an external check of calibration, you must take the EBT out of service. You may not use the EBT again for DOT alcohol testing until it is repaired and passes an exter\u00adnal calibration check. (4) You must maintain records of the inspection, maintenance, and calibra\u00adtion of EBTs as provided in \u00a7 40.333(a)(2) . (5) You must ensure that inspection, maintenance, and calibration of the EBT are performed by its manufacturer or a maintenance representative cer\u00adtified either by the manufacturer or by a state health agency or other appro\u00adpriate state agency. \u00a7 40.235 What are the requirements for proper use and care of ASDs? (a) As an ASD manufacturer, you must submit, for NHTSA approval, a QAP for your ASD before NHTSA places the ASD on the CPL. Your QAP must specify the methods used for quality control checks, temperatures at which the ASD must be stored and used, the shelf life of the device, and environmental conditions (e.g., tem\u00ad perature, altitude, humidity) that may affect the ASD's performance. (b) As a manufacturer, you must in\u00ad clude with each ASD instructions for its use and care consistent with the QAP. The instructions must include di\u00adrections on the proper use of the ASD, and, where applicable the time within which the device must be read, and the manner in which the reading is made. (c) As the user of the ADS (e.g., em\u00ad ployer, STT), you must follow the QAP instructions. (d) You are not permitted to use an ASD that does not pass the specified quality control checks or that has passed its expiration date. (e) As an employer, with respect to breath ASDs, you must also follow the 634 Office of the Secretary of Transportation device use and care requirements of \u00a7 40.233 . Subpart L\u2014Alcohol Screening Tests \u00a7 40.241 What are the first steps in any alcohol screening test? As the BAT or STT you will take the following steps to begin all alcohol screening tests, regardless of the type of testing device you are using: (a) When a specific time for an em\u00ad ployee's test has been scheduled, or the collection site is at the employee's worksite, and the employee does not appear at the collection site at the scheduled time, contact the DER to de\u00ad termine the appropriate interval with-in which the DER has determined the employee is authorized to arrive. If the employee's arrival is delayed beyond that time, you must notify the DER that the employee has not reported for testing. In a situation where a C/TPA has notified an owner/operator or other individual employee to report for test\u00ading and the employee does not appear, the C/TPA must notify the employee that he or she has refused to test. (b) Ensure that, when the employee enters the alcohol testing site, you begin the alcohol testing process with-out undue delay. For example, you must not wait because the employee says he or she is not ready or because an authorized employer or employee representative is delayed in arriving. (1) If the employee is also going to take a DOT drug test, you must, to the greatest extent practicable, ensure that the alcohol test is completed be-fore the urine collection process be-gins. (2) If the employee needs medical at\u00ad tention (e.g., an injured employee in an emergency medical facility who is re\u00adquired to have a post-accident test), do not delay this treatment to conduct a test. (c) Require the employee to provide positive identification. You must see a photo ID issued by the employer (other than in the case of an owner-operator or other self-employer individual) or a Federal, state, or local government (e.g., a driver's license). You may not accept faxes or photocopies of identi\u00adfication. Positive identification by an \u00a740.243 employer representative (not a co- worker or another employee being test\u00ad ed) is also acceptable. If the employee cannot produce positive identification, you must contact a DER to verify the identity of the employee. (d) If the employee asks, provide your identification to the employee. Your identification must include your name and your employer's name but is not required to include your picture, ad-dress, or telephone number. (e) Explain the testing procedure to the employee, including showing the employee the instructions on the back of the ATF. (f) Complete Step 1 of the ATF. (g) Direct the employee to complete Step 2 on the ATF and sign the certifi\u00adcation. If the employee refuses to sign this certification, you must document this refusal on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF and immediately notify the DER. This is a refusal to test. \u00a7 40.243 What is the procedure for an alcohol screening test using an EBT or non-evidential breath ASD? As the BAT or STT, you must take the following steps: (a) Select, or allow the employee to select, an individually wrapped or sealed mouthpiece from the testing materials. (b) Open the individually wrapped or sealed mouthpiece in view of the em\u00adployee and insert it into the device in accordance with the manufacturer's in\u00ad structions. (c) Instruct the employee to blow steadily and forcefully into the mouth-piece for at least six seconds or until the device indicates that an adequate amount of breath has been obtained. (d) Show the employee the displayed test result. (e) If the device is one that prints the test number, testing device name and serial number, time, and result directly onto the ATF, you must check to en-sure that the information has been printed correctly onto the ATF. (f) If the device is one that prints the test number, testing device name and serial number, time and result, but on a separate printout rather than di\u00adrectly onto the ATF, you must affix the printout of the information to the 635 \u00a740.245 designated space on the ATF with tam- per-evident tape or use a self-adhesive label that is tamper-evident. (g) If the device is one that does not print the test number, testing device name and serial number, time, and re\u00adsult, or it is a device not being used with a printer, you must record this in-formation in Step 3 of the ATF. \u00a7 40.245 What is the procedure for an alcohol screening test using a saliva ASD? As the STT, you must take the fol\u00ad lowing steps: (a) Check the expiration date on the device and show it to the employee. You may not use the device after its expiration date. (b) Open an individually wrapped or sealed package containing the device in the presence of the employee. (c) Offer the employee the oppor\u00ad tunity to use the device. If the em\u00adployee uses it, you must instruct the employee to insert it into his or her mouth and use it in a manner described by the device's manufacturer. (d) If the employee chooses not to use the device, or in all cases in which a new test is necessary because the de-vice did not activate (see paragraph (g) of this section), you must insert the de-vice into the employee's mouth and gather saliva in the manner described by the device's manufacturer. You must wear single-use examination or similar gloves while doing so and change them following each test. (e) When the device is removed from the employee's mouth, you must follow the manufacturer's instructions re\u00ad garding necessary next steps in ensur\u00ading that the device has activated. (f)(1) If you were unable to success- fully follow the procedures of para-graphs (c) through (e) of this section (e.g., the device breaks, you drop the device on the floor), you must discard the device and conduct a new test using a new device. (2) The new device you use must be one that has been under your control or that of the employer before the test. (3) You must note on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF the reason for the new test. (Note: You may continue using the same ATF with which you began the test.) 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) (4) You must offer the employee the choice of using the device or having you use it unless the employee, in the opinion of the STT or BAT, was respon\u00adsible (e.g., the employee dropped the device) for the new test needing to be conducted. (5) If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section on the new test, you must end the collection and put an explanation on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF. (6) You must then direct the em\u00ad ployee to take a new test immediately, using an EBT for the screening test. (g) If you are able to successfully fol\u00ad low the procedures of paragraphs (c)-(e) of this section, but the device does not activate, you must discard the device and conduct a new test, in the same manner as provided in paragraph (f) of this section. In this case, you must place the device into the employee's mouth to collect saliva for the new test. (h) You must read the result dis\u00ad played on the device no sooner than the device's manufacturer instructs. In all cases the result displayed must be read within 15 minutes of the test. You must then show the device and its reading to the employee and enter the result on the ATF. (i) You must never re-use devices, swabs, gloves or other materials used in saliva testing. (j) You must note the fact that you used a saliva ASD in Step 3 of the ATF. \u00a7 40.247 What procedures does the BAT or STT follow after a screening test result? (a) If the test result is an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02, as the BAT or STT, you must do the fol\u00adlowing: (1) Sign and date Step 3 of the ATF; and (2) Transmit the result to the DER in a confidential manner, as provided in \u00a7 40.255 . (b) If the test result is an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or higher, as the BAT or STT, you must direct the em\u00adployee to take a confirmation test. (1) If you are the BAT who will con- duct the confirmation test, you must 636 Office of the Secretary of Transportation then conduct the test using the proce\u00ad dures beginning at \u00a7 40.251 . (2) If you are not the BAT who will conduct the confirmation test, direct the employee to take a confirmation test, sign and date Step 3 of the ATF, and give the employee Copy 2 of the ATF. (3) If the confirmation test will be performed at a different site from the screening test, you must take the fol\u00adlowing additional steps: (i) Advise the employee not to eat, drink, put anything (e.g., cigarette, chewing gum) into his or her mouth, or belch; (ii) Tell the employee the reason for the waiting period required by \u00a7 40.251(a) (i.e., to prevent an accumula\u00ad tion of mouth alcohol from leading to an artificially high reading); (iii) Explain that following your in\u00ad structions concerning the waiting pe\u00adriod is to the employee's benefit; (iv) Explain that the confirmation test will be conducted at the end of the waiting period, even if the instructions have not been followed; (v) Note on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF that the waiting period in\u00adstructions were provided; (vi) Instruct the person accom\u00ad panying the employee to carry a copy of the ATF to the BAT who will per-form the confirmation test; and (vii) Ensure that you or another BAT, STT, or employer representative observe the employee as he or she is transported to the confirmation test\u00ading site. You must direct the employee not to attempt to drive a motor vehicle to the confirmation testing site. (c) If the screening test is invalid, you must, as the BAT or STT, tell the employee the test is cancelled and note the problem on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF. If practicable, repeat the testing process (see \u00a7 40. 271). Subpart M\u2014Alcohol Confirmation Tests \u00a7 40.251 What are the first steps in an alcohol confirmation test? As the BAT for an alcohol confirma\u00ad tion test, you must follow these steps to begin the confirmation test process: (a) You must carry out a requirement for a waiting period before the con-\u00a740.251 firmation test, by taking the following steps: (1) You must ensure that the waiting period lasts at least 15 minutes, start\u00ading with the completion of the screen\u00ading test. After the waiting period has elapsed, you should begin the confirma\u00adtion test as soon as possible, but not more than 30 minutes after the comple\u00adtion of the screening test. (i) If the confirmation test is taking place at a different location from the screening test (see \u00a7 40.247(b)(3)) the time of transit between sites counts to-ward the waiting period if the STT or BAT who conducted the screening test provided the waiting period instruc\u00adtions. (ii) If you cannot verify, through re- view of the ATF, that waiting period instructions were provided, then you must carry out the waiting period re\u00adquirement. (iii) You or another BAT or STT, or an employer representative, must ob\u00adserve the employee during the waiting period. (2) Concerning the waiting period, you must tell the employee: (i) Not to eat, drink, put anything (e.g., cigarette, chewing gum) into his or her mouth, or belch; (ii) The reason for the waiting period (i.e., to prevent an accumulation of mouth alcohol from leading to an arti\u00adficially high reading); (iii) That following your instructions concerning the waiting period is to the employee's benefit; and (iv) That the confirmation test will be conducted at the end of the waiting period, even if the instructions have not been followed. (3) If you become aware that the em\u00ad ployee has not followed the instruc\u00adtions, you must note this on the ''Re-marks'' line of the ATF. (b) If you did not conduct the screen\u00ad ing test for the employee, you must re-quire positive identification of the em\u00adployee, explain the confirmation proce\u00addures, and use a new ATF. You must note on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF that a different BAT or STT conducted the screening test. (c) Complete Step 1 of the ATF. (d) Direct the employee to complete Step 2 on the ATF and sign the certifi\u00adcation. If the employee refuses to sign 637 \u00a740.253 this certification, you must document this refusal on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF and immediately notify the DER. This is a refusal to test. (e) Even if more than 30 minutes have passed since the screening test result was obtained, you must begin the con\u00adfirmation test procedures in \u00a7 40.253, not another screening test. (f) You must note on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF the time that elapsed between the two events, and if the con\u00adfirmation test could not begin within 30 minutes of the screening test, the reason why. (g) Beginning the confirmation test procedures after the 30 minutes have elapsed does not invalidate the screen\u00ading or confirmation tests, but it may constitute a regulatory violation sub\u00adject to DOT agency sanction. \u00a7 40.253 What are the procedures for conducting an alcohol confirmation test? As the BAT conducting an alcohol confirmation test, you must follow these steps in order to complete the confirmation test process: (a) In the presence of the employee, you must conduct an air blank on the EBT you are using before beginning the confirmation test and show the reading to the employee. (1) If the reading is 0.00, the test may proceed. If the reading is greater than 0.00, you must conduct another air blank. (2) If the reading on the second air blank is 0.00, the test may proceed. If the reading is greater than 0.00, you must take the EBT out of service. (3) If you take an EBT out of service for this reason, no one may use it for testing until the EBT is found to be within tolerance limits on an external check of calibration. (4) You must proceed with the test of the employee using another EBT, if one is available. (b) You must open a new individually wrapped or sealed mouthpiece in view of the employee and insert it into the device in accordance with the manufac\u00adturer's instructions. (c) You must ensure that you and the employee read the unique test number displayed on the EBT. 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) (d) You must instruct the employee to blow steadily and forcefully into the mouthpiece for at least six seconds or until the device indicates that an ade\u00adquate amount of breath has been ob\u00ad tained. (e) You must show the employee the result displayed on the EBT. (f) You must show the employee the result and unique test number that the EBT prints out either directly onto the ATF or onto a separate printout. (g) If the EBT provides a separate printout of the result, you must attach the printout to the designated space on the ATF with tamper-evident tape, or use a self-adhesive label that is tam-per-evident. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as FR 41954, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.255 What happens next after the alcohol confirmation test result? (a) After the EBT has printed the re\u00ad sult of an alcohol confirmation test, you must, as the BAT, take the fol\u00adlowing additional steps: (1) Sign and date Step 3 of the ATF. (2) If the alcohol confirmation test result is lower than 0.02, nothing fur\u00adther is required of the employee. As the BAT, you must sign and date Step 3 of the ATF. (3) If the alcohol confirmation test result is 0.02 or higher, direct the em\u00adployee to sign and date Step 4 of the ATF. If the employee does not do so, you must note this on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF. However, this is not considered a refusal to test. (4) If the test is invalid, tell the em\u00ad ployee the test is cancelled and note the problem on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF. If practicable, conduct a re-test. (see \u00a7 40.271). (5) Immediately transmit the result directly to the DER in a confidential manner. (i) You may transmit the results using Copy 1 of the ATF, in person, by telephone, or by electronic means. In any case, you must immediately notify the DER of any result of 0.02 or greater by any means (e.g., telephone or secure fax machine) that ensures the result is immediately received by the DER. You must not transmit these results through C/TPAs or other service agents. 638 Office of the Secretary of Transportation (ii) If you do not make the initial transmission in writing, you must fol\u00ad low up the initial transmission with Copy 1 of the ATF. (b) As an employer, you must take the following steps with respect to the receipt and storage of alcohol test re\u00adsult information: (1) If you receive any test results that are not in writing (e.g., by tele\u00ad phone or electronic means), you must establish a mechanism to establish the identity of the BAT sending you the re\u00adsults. (2) You must store all test result in- formation in a way that protects con\u00adfidentiality. Subpart N\u2014Problems in Alcohol Testing \u00a7 40.261 What is a refusal to take an al\u00ad cohol test, and what are the con- sequences? (a) As an employee, you are consid\u00ad ered to have refused to take an alcohol test if you: (1) Fail to appear for any test (except a pre-employment test) within a rea\u00adsonable time, as determined by the em\u00adployer, consistent with applicable DOT agency regulations, after being di\u00adrected to do so by the employer. This includes the failure of an employee (in\u00adcluding an owner-operator) to appear for a test when called by a C/TPA (see \u00a740.241(a)); (2) Fail to remain at the testing site until the testing process is complete; Provided, That an employee who leaves the testing site before the testing proc\u00adess commences (see \u00a7 40.243(a)) for a pre-employment test is not deemed to have refused to test; (3) Fail to provide an adequate amount of saliva or breath for any al\u00adcohol test required by this part or DOT agency regulations; Provided, That an employee who does not provide an ade\u00adquate amount of breath or saliva be-cause he or she has left the testing site before the testing process commences (see \u00a7 40.243(a)) for a pre-employment test is not deemed to have refused to test; (4) Fail to provide a sufficient breath specimen, and the physician has deter-mined, through a required medical evaluation, that there was no adequate \u00a740.263 medical explanation for the failure (see \u00a740.265(c)); (5) Fail to undergo a medical exam\u00ad ination or evaluation, as directed by the employer as part of the insufficient breath procedures outlined at \u00a740.265(c); (6) Fail to sign the certification at Step 2 of the ATF (see \u00a7\u00a7 40.241(g) and 40.251(d)); or (7) Fail to cooperate with any part of the testing process. (b) As an employee, if you refuse to take an alcohol test, you incur the same consequences specified under DOT agency regulations for a violation of those DOT agency regulations. (c) As a BAT or an STT, or as the physician evaluating a ''shy lung'' situ\u00adation, when an employee refuses to test as provided in paragraph (a) of this sec\u00adtion, you must terminate the portion of the testing process in which you are involved, document the refusal on the ATF (or in a separate document which you cause to be attached to the form), immediately notify the DER by any means (e.g., telephone or secure fax machine) that ensures the refusal noti\u00adfication is immediately received. You must make this notification directly to the DER (not using a C/TPA as an intermediary). (d) As an employee, when you refuse to take a non-DOT test or to sign a non-DOT form, you have not refused to take a DOT test. There are no con-sequences under DOT agency regula\u00adtions for such a refusal. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41954, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.263 What happens when em\u00ad ployee is unable to provide a suffi\u00ad cient amount of saliva for an alco\u00adhol screening test? (a) As the STT, you must take the following steps if an employee is un\u00ad able to provide sufficient saliva to complete a test on a saliva screening device (e.g., the employee does not pro- vide sufficient saliva to activate the device). (1) You must conduct a new screening test using a new screening device. (2) If the employee refuses to make the attempt to complete the new test, you must discontinue testing, note the fact on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF, 639 \u00a740.265 and immediately notify the DER. This is a refusal to test. (3) If the employee has not provided a sufficient amount of saliva to complete the new test, you must note the fact on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF and im\u00ad mediately notify the DER. (b) As the DER, when the STT in- forms you that the employee has not provided a sufficient amount of saliva (see paragraph (a)(3) of this section), you must immediately arrange to ad-minister an alcohol test to the em\u00adployee using an EBT or other breath testing device. \u00a7 40.265 What happens when an em\u00ad ployee is unable to provide a suffi\u00ad cient amount of breath for an alco\u00adhol test? (a) If an employee does not provide a sufficient amount of breath to permit a valid breath test, you must take the steps listed in this section. (b) As the BAT or STT, you must in\u00ad struct the employee to attempt again to provide a sufficient amount of breath and about the proper way to do so. (1) If the employee refuses to make the attempt, you must discontinue the test, note the fact on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF, and immediately no\u00adtify the DER. This is a refusal to test. (2) If the employee again attempts and fails to provide a sufficient amount of breath, you may provide another op\u00adportunity to the employee to do so if you believe that there is a strong like\u00adlihood that it could result in providing a sufficient amount of breath. (3) When the employee's attempts under paragraph (b)(2) of this section have failed to produce a sufficient amount of breath, you must note the fact on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF and immediately notify the DER. (4) If you are using an EBT that has the capability of operating manually, you may attempt to conduct the test in manual mode. (5) If you are qualified to use a saliva ASD and you are in the screening test stage, you may change to a saliva ASD only to complete the screening test. (c) As the employer, when the BAT or STT informs you that the employee has not provided a sufficient amount of breath, you must direct the employee 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) to obtain, within five days, an evalua\u00adtion from a licensed physician who is acceptable to you and who has exper\u00adtise in the medical issues raised by the employee's failure to provide a suffi\u00ad cient specimen. (1) You are required to provide the physician who will conduct the evalua\u00adtion with the following information and instructions: (i) That the employee was required to take a DOT breath alcohol test, but was unable to provide a sufficient amount of breath to complete the test; (ii) The consequences of the appro\u00ad priate DOT agency regulation for refus\u00ading to take the required alcohol test; (iii) That the physician must provide you with a signed statement of his or her conclusions; and (iv) That the physician, in his or her reasonable medical judgment, must base those conclusions on one of the following determinations: (A) A medical condition has, or with a high degree of probability could have, precluded the employee from providing a sufficient amount of breath. The phy\u00adsician must not include in the signed statement detailed information on the employee's medical condition. In this case, the test is cancelled. (B) There is not an adequate basis for determining that a medical condition has, or with a high degree of prob\u00adability could have, precluded the em\u00adployee from providing a sufficient amount of breath. This constitutes a refusal to test. (C) For purposes of paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section, a medical condition includes an ascer\u00adtainable physiological condition (e.g., a respiratory system dysfunction) or a medically documented pre-existing psychological disorder, but does not in\u00adclude unsupported assertions of ''situa\u00adtional anxiety'' or hyperventilation. (2) As the physician making the eval\u00ad uation, after making your determina\u00adtion, you must provide a written state\u00adment of your conclusions and the basis for them to the DER directly (and not through a C/TPA acting as an itermediary). You must not include in this statement detailed information on the employee's medical condition be\u00ad yond what is necessary to explain your conclusion. 640 Office of the Secretary of Transportation (3) Upon receipt of the report from the examining physician, as the DER you must immediately inform the em\u00ad ployee and take appropriate action based upon your DOT agency regula\u00ad tions. \u00a7 40.267 What problems always cause an alcohol test to be cancelled? As an employer, a BAT, or an STT, you must cancel an alcohol test if any of the following problems occur. These are ''fatal flaws.'' You must inform the DER that the test was cancelled and must be treated as if the test never oc\u00adcurred. These problems are: (a) In the case of a screening test conducted on a saliva ASD: (1) The STT reads the result either sooner than or later than the time al\u00ad lotted by the manufacturer (see \u00a740.245(h)); (2) The device does not activate (see \u00a7 40.245(g)); or (3) The device is used for a test after the expiration date printed on its pack- age (see \u00a7 40.245(a)). (b) In the case of a screening or con\u00ad firmation test conducted on an EBT, the sequential test number or alcohol concentration displayed on the EBT is not the same as the sequential test number or alcohol concentration on the printed result (see \u00a7 40.253(c), (e) and (f)). (c) In the case of a confirmation test: (1) The BAT conducts the confirma\u00ad tion test before the end of the min\u00ad imum 15-minute waiting period (see \u00a740.251(a)(1)); (2) The BAT does not conduct an air blank before the confirmation test (see \u00a740.253(a)); (3) There is not a 0.00 result on the air blank conducted before the con\u00adfirmation test (see \u00a7 40.253(a)(1) and (2)); (4) The EBT does not print the result (see \u00a7 40.253(f)); or (5) The next external calibration check of the EBT produces a result that differs by more than the tolerance stated in the QAP from the known value of the test standard. In this case, every result of 0.02 or above obtained on the EBT since the last valid exter\u00adnal calibration check is cancelled (see \u00a7 40.233(a)(1) and (d)). \u00a740.271 \u00a7 40.269 What problems cause an alco\u00ad hol test to be cancelled unless they are corrected? As a BAT or STT, or employer, you must cancel an alcohol test if any of the following problems occur, unless they are corrected. These are ''correct- able flaws.'' These problems are: (a) The BAT or STT does not sign the ATF (see \u00a7\u00a7 40.247(a)(1) and 40.255(a)(1)). (b) The BAT or STT fails to note on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF that the employee has not signed the ATF after the result is obtained (see \u00a740.255(a)(2)). (c) The BAT or STT uses a non-DOT form for the test (see \u00a7 \u00a7 40.271 How are alcohol testing prob\u00ad lems corrected? (a) As a BAT or STT, you have the responsibility of trying to complete successfully an alcohol test for each employee. (1) If, during or shortly after the test\u00ad ing process, you become aware of any event that will cause the test to be cancelled (see \u00a7 40.267 ), you must try to correct the problem promptly, if prac\u00adticable. You may repeat the testing process as part of this effort. (2) If repeating the testing process is necessary, you must begin a new test as soon as possible. You must use a new ATF, a new sequential test number, and, if needed, a new ASD and/or a new EBT. It is permissible to use additional technical capabilities of the EBT (e.g., manual operation) if you have been trained to do so in accordance with \u00a7 40.213(c) . (3) If repeating the testing process is necessary, you are not limited in the number of attempts to complete the test, provided that the employee is making a good faith effort to comply with the testing process. (4) If another testing device is not available for the new test at the test\u00ading site, you must immediately notify the DER and advise the DER that the test could not be completed. As the DER who receives this information, you must make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the test is conducted at another testing site as soon as possible. (b) If, as an STT, BAT, employer or other service agent administering the testing process, you become aware of a 641 \u00a740.273 ''correctable flaw'' (see \u00a7 40.269 ) that has not already been corrected, you must take all practicable action to cor\u00ad rect the problem so that the test is not cancelled. (1) If the problem resulted from the omission of required information, you must, as the person responsible for pro\u00ad viding that information, supply in writing the missing information and a signed statement that it is true and ac\u00ad curate. For example, suppose you are a BAT and you forgot to make a nota\u00adtion on the ''Remarks'' line of the ATF that the employee did not sign the cer\u00ad tification. You would, when the prob\u00adlem is called to your attention, supply a signed statement that the employee failed or refused to sign the certifi\u00adcation after the result was obtained, and that your signed statement is true and accurate. (2) If the problem is the use of a non- DOT form, you must, as the person re\u00ad sponsible for the use of the incorrect form, certify in writing that the incor\u00adrect form contains all the information needed for a valid DOT alcohol test. You must also provide a signed state\u00adment that the incorrect form was used inadvertently or as the only means of conducting a test, in circumstances be\u00ad yond your control, and the steps you have taken to prevent future use of non-DOT forms for DOT tests. You must supply this information on the same business day on which you are notified of the problem, transmitting it by fax or courier. (c) If you cannot correct the problem, you must cancel the test. \u00a7 40.273 What is the effect of a can- celled alcohol test? (a) A cancelled alcohol test is neither positive nor negative. (1) As an employer, you must not at- tach to a cancelled test the con-sequences of a test result that is 0.02 or greater (e.g., removal from a safety-sensitive position). (2) As an employer, you must not use a cancelled test in a situation where an employee needs a test result that is below 0.02 (e.g., in the case of a return- to-duty or follow-up test to authorize the employee to perform safety-sen\u00adsitive functions). 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) (3) As an employer, you must not di\u00ad rect a recollection for an employee be- cause a test has been cancelled, except in the situations cited in paragraph (a)(2) of this section or other provisions of this part. (b) A cancelled test does not count toward compliance with DOT require\u00adments, such as a minimum random testing rate. (c) When a test must be cancelled, if you are the BAT, STT, or other person who determines that the cancellation is necessary, you must inform the af\u00adfected DER within 48 hours of the can\u00ad cellation. (d) A cancelled DOT test does not provide a valid basis for an employer to conduct a non-DOT test (i.e., a test under company authority). \u00a7 40.275 What is the effect of proce\u00ad dural problems that are not suffi\u00ad cient to cancel an alcohol test? (a) As an STT, BAT, employer, or a service agent administering the testing process, you must document any errors in the testing process of which you be-come aware, even if they are not ''fatal flaws'' or ''correctable flaws'' listed in this subpart. Decisions about the ulti\u00ad mate impact of these errors will be de\u00adtermined by administrative or legal proceedings, subject to the limitation of paragraph (b) of this section. (b) No person concerned with the testing process may declare a test can- celled based on a mistake in the proc\u00ad ess that does not have a significant ad-verse effect on the right of the em\u00ad ployee to a fair and accurate test. For example, it is inconsistent with this part to cancel a test based on a minor administrative mistake (e.g., the omis\u00ad sion of the employee's middle initial) or an error that does not affect em\u00ad ployee protections under this part. Nor does the failure of an employee to sign in Step 4 of the ATF result in the can\u00adcellation of the test. Nor is a test to be cancelled on the basis of a claim by an employee that he or she was improp\u00ad erly selected for testing. (c) As an employer, these errors, even though not sufficient to cancel an alco\u00adhol test result, may subject you to en\u00adforcement action under DOT agency regulations. 642 Office of the Secretary of Transportation \u00a7 40.277 Are alcohol tests other than saliva or breath permitted under these regulations? No, other types of alcohol tests (e,g., blood and urine) are not authorized for testing done under this part. Only sa\u00adliva or breath for screening tests and breath for confirmation tests using ap\u00adproved devices are permitted. Subpart O\u2014Substance Abuse Pro\u00ad fessionals and the Return-to- Duty Process \u00a7 40.281 Who is qualified to act as a SAP?

(c) Qualification training. You must receive qualification training meeting the requirements of this paragraph (c). (1) Qualification training must pro- vide instruction on the following sub\u00adjects: (i) Background, rationale, and cov\u00ad erage of the Department's drug and al\u00ad cohol testing program; (ii) 49 CFR Part 40 and DOT agency drug and alcohol testing rules; (iii) Key DOT drug testing require\u00ad ments, including collections, labora\u00adtory testing, MRO review, and prob\u00adlems in drug testing; (iv) Key DOT alcohol testing require\u00ad ments, including the testing process, the role of BATs and STTs, and prob\u00adlems in alcohol tests; (v) SAP qualifications and prohibi\u00ad tions; (vi) The role of the SAP in the re- turn-to-duty process, including the ini\u00adtial employee evaluation, referrals for education and/or treatment, the follow-up evaluation, continuing treatment recommendations, and the follow-up testing plan; (vii) SAP consultation and commu\u00ad nication with employers, MROs, and treatment providers; (viii) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements; (ix) Issues that SAPs confront in car\u00ad rying out their duties under the pro-gram. (2) Following your completion of qualification training under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, you must satisfac\u00adtorily complete an examination admin\u00adistered by a nationally-recognized pro\u00adfessional or training organization. The examination must comprehensively cover all the elements of qualification training listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. (3) The following is the schedule for qualification training you must meet: (i) If you became a SAP before Au- gust 1, 2001, you must meet the quali\u00adfication training requirement no later than December 31, 2003. (ii) If you become a SAP between Au- gust 1, 2001, and December 31, 2003, you must meet the qualification training requirement no later than December 31, 2003. 643 \u00a740.283 (iii) If you become a SAP on or after January 1, 2004, you must meet the qualification training requirement be- fore you begin to perform SAP func\u00adtions. (d) Continuing education. During each three-year period from the date on which you satisfactorily complete the examination under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must complete con\u00ad tinuing education consisting of at least 12 professional development hours (e.g., CEUs) relevant to performing SAP functions. (1) This continuing education must include material concerning new tech\u00ad nologies, interpretations, recent guid\u00ad ance, rule changes, and other informa\u00adtion about developments in SAP prac\u00ad tice, pertaining to the DOT program, since the time you met the qualifica\u00adtion training requirements of this sec\u00adtion. (2) Your continuing education activi\u00ad ties must include documentable assess\u00ad ment tools to assist you in determining whether you have adequately learned the material. (e) Documentation. You must main\u00ad tain documentation showing that you currently meet all requirements of this section. You must provide this docu\u00admentation on request to DOT agency representatives and to employers and C/TPAs who are using or contem\u00adplating using your services. \u00a7 40.283 How does a certification orga\u00ad nization obtain recognition for its members as SAPs? (a) If you represent a certification or\u00ad ganization that wants DOT to author\u00ad ize its certified drug and alcohol coun\u00ad selors to be added to \u00a7 40.281(a)(5), you may submit a written petition to DOT requesting a review of your petition for inclusion. (b) You must obtain the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) accreditation before DOT will act on your petition. (c) You must also meet the minimum requirements of Appendix E to this part before DOT will act on your peti\u00ad tion. 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) \u00a7 40.285 When is a SAP evaluation re\u00ad quired? (a) As an employee, when you have violated DOT drug and alcohol regula\u00ad tions, you cannot again perform any DOT safety-sensitive duties for any employer until and unless you com\u00ad plete the SAP evaluation, referral, and education/treatment process set forth in this subpart and in applicable DOT agency regulations. The first step in this process is a SAP evaluation. (b) For purposes of this subpart, a verified positive DOT drug test result, a DOT alcohol test with a result indi\u00adcating an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater, a refusal to test (including by adulterating or substituting a urine specimen) or any other violation of the prohibition on the use of alcohol or drugs under a DOT agency regulation constitutes a DOT drug and alcohol regulation violation. \u00a7 40.287 What information is an em\u00ad ployer required to provide con\u00ad cerning SAP services to an em\u00adployee who has a DOT drug and al\u00adcohol regulation violation? As an employer, you must provide to each employee (including an applicant or new employee) who violates a DOT drug and alcohol regulation a listing of SAPs readily available to the employee and acceptable to you, with names, ad-dresses, and telephone numbers. You cannot charge the employee any fee for compiling or providing this list. You may provide this list yourself or through a C/TPA or other service agent. \u00a7 40.289 Are employers required to provide SAP and treatment services to employees? (a) As an employer, you are not re\u00ad quired to provide a SAP evaluation or any subsequent recommended edu\u00adcation or treatment for an employee who has violated a DOT drug and alco\u00adhol regulation. (b) However, if you offer that em\u00ad ployee an opportunity to return to a DOT safety-sensitive duty following a violation, you must, before the em\u00adployee again performs that duty, en-sure that the employee receives an 644 Office of the Secretary of Transportation evaluation by a SAP meeting the re\u00ad quirements of \u00a7 40.281 and that the em\u00ad ployee successfully complies with the SAP's evaluation recommendations. (c) Payment for SAP evaluations and services is left for employers and em\u00ad ployees to decide and may be governed by existing management-labor agree\u00adments and health care benefits. \u00a7 40.291 What is the role of the SAP in the evaluation, referral, and treat\u00ad ment process of an employee who has violated DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulations? (a) As a SAP, you are charged with: (1) Making a face-to-face clinical as\u00ad sessment and evaluation to determine what assistance is needed by the em\u00ad ployee to resolve problems associated with alcohol and/or drug use; (2) Referring the employee to an ap\u00ad propriate education and/or treatment program; (3) Conducting a face-to-face follow- up evaluation to determine if the em\u00adployee has actively participated in the education and/or treatment program and has demonstrated successful com\u00ad pliance with the initial assessment and evaluation recommendations; (4) Providing the DER with a follow- up drug and/or alcohol testing plan for the employee; and (5) Providing the employee and em\u00ad ployer with recommendations for con\u00adtinuing education and/or treatment. (b) As a SAP, you are not an advo\u00ad cate for the employer or employee. Your function is to protect the public interest in safety by professionally evaluating the employee and recom\u00admending appropriate education/treat\u00adment, follow-up tests, and aftercare. \u00a7 40.293 What is the SAP's function in conducting the initial evaluation of an employee? As a SAP, for every employee who comes to you following a DOT drug and alcohol regulation violation, you must accomplish the following: (a) Provide a comprehensive face-to- face assessment and clinical evalua\u00adtion. (b) Recommend a course of education and/or treatment with which the em\u00adployee must demonstrate successful compliance prior to returning to DOT safety-sensitive duty. \u00a740.293 (1) You must make such a rec\u00ad ommendation for every individual who has violated a DOT drug and alcohol regulation. (2) You must make a recommenda\u00ad tion for education and/or treatment that will, to the greatest extent pos\u00ad sible, protect public safety in the event that the employee returns to the per\u00ad formance of safety-sensitive functions. (c) Appropriate education may in\u00ad clude, but is not limited to, self-help groups (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous) and community lectures, where attend\u00adance can be independently verified, and bona fide drug and alcohol education courses. (d) Appropriate treatment may in\u00ad clude, but is not limited to, in-patient hospitalization, partial in-patient treatment, out-patient counseling pro- grams, and aftercare. (e) You must provide a written report directly to the DER highlighting your specific recommendations for assist\u00ad ance (see \u00a7 40.311(c)). (f) For purposes of your role in the evaluation process, you must assume that a verified positive test result has conclusively established that the em\u00ad ployee committed a DOT drug and al\u00ad cohol regulation violation. You must not take into consideration in any way, as a factor in determining what your recommendation will be, any of the following: (1) A claim by the employee that the test was unjustified or inaccurate; (2) Statements by the employee that attempt to mitigate the seriousness of a violation of a DOT drug or alcohol regulation (e.g., related to assertions of use of hemp oil, ''medical marijuana'' use, ''contact positives,'' poppy seed in\u00ad gestion, job stress); or (3) Personal opinions you may have about the justification or rationale for drug and alcohol testing. (g) In the course of gathering infor\u00ad mation for purposes of your evaluation in the case of a drug-related violation, you may consult with the MRO. As the MRO, you are required to cooperate with the SAP and provide available in-formation the SAP requests. It is not necessary to obtain the consent of the employee to provide this information. 645 \u00a740.295 \u00a7 40.295 May employees or employers seek a second SAP evaluation if they disagree with the first SAP's recommendations? (a) As an employee with a DOT drug and alcohol regulation violation, when you have been evaluated by a SAP, you must not seek a second SAP's evalua\u00adtion in order to obtain another rec\u00adommendation. (b) As an employer, you must not seek a second SAP's evaluation if the employee has already been evaluated by a qualified SAP. If the employee, contrary to paragraph (a) of this sec\u00adtion, has obtained a second SAP eval\u00aduation, as an employer you may not rely on it for any purpose under this part. \u00a7 40.297 Does anyone have the author\u00ad ity to change a SAP's initial evalua\u00ad tion? (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no one (e.g., an em\u00ad ployer, employee, a managed-care pro\u00ad vider, any service agent) may change in any way the SAP's evaluation or recommendations for assistance. For example, a third party is not permitted to make more or less stringent a SAP's recommendation by changing the SAP's evaluation or seeking another SAP's evaluation. (b) The SAP who made the initial evaluation may modify his or her ini\u00adtial evaluation and recommendations based on new or additional information (e.g., from an education or treatment program). \u00a7 40.299 What is the SAP's role and what are the limits on a SAP's dis\u00ad cretion in referring employees for education and treatment? (a) As a SAP, upon your determina\u00ad tion of the best recommendation for as\u00ad sistance, you will serve as a referral source to assist the employee's entry into a education and/or treatment pro-gram. (b) To prevent the appearance of a conflict of interest, you must not refer an employee requiring assistance to your private practice or to a person or organization from which you receive payment or to a person or organization in which you have a financial interest. You are precluded from making refer-49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) rals to entities with which you are fi\u00adnancially associated. (c) There are four exceptions to the prohibitions contained in paragraph (b) of this section. You may refer an em\u00adployee to any of the following pro\u00adviders of assistance, regardless of your relationship with them: (1) A public agency (e.g., treatment facility) operated by a state, county, or municipality; (2) The employer or a person or orga\u00ad nization under contract to the em\u00adployer to provide alcohol or drug treat\u00adment and/or education services (e.g., the employer's contracted treatment provider); (3) The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment under the em\u00adployee's health insurance program (e.g., the single substance abuse in-pa\u00ad tient treatment program made avail-able by the employee's insurance cov\u00aderage plan); or (4) The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment reasonably available to the employee (e.g., the only treatment facility or education program reasonably located within the general commuting area). \u00a7 40.301 What is the SAP's function in the follow-up evaluation of an em\u00ad ployee? (a) As a SAP, after you have pre- scribed assistance under \u00a7 40.293, you must re-evaluate the employee to de\u00ad termine if the employee has success-fully carried out your education and/or treatment recommendations. (1) This is your way to gauge for the employer the employee's ability to demonstrate successful compliance with the education and/or treatment plan. (2) Your evaluation may serve as one of the reasons the employer decides to return the employee to safety-sensitive duty. (b) As the SAP making the follow-up evaluation determination, you must: (1) Confer with or obtain appropriate documentation from the appropriate education and/or treatment program professionals where the employee was referred; and (2) Conduct a face-to-face clinical interview with the employee to deter-mine if the employee demonstrates 646 Office of the Secretary of Transportation successful compliance with your initial evaluation recommendations. (c) (1) If the employee has dem\u00ad onstrated successful compliance, you must provide a written report directly to the DER highlighting your clinical determination that the employee has done so with your initial evaluation recommendation (see \u00a7 40.311(d)). (2) You may determine that an em\u00ad ployee has successfully demonstrated compliance even though the employee has not yet completed the full regimen of education and/or treatment you rec\u00ad ommended or needs additional asssitance. For example, if the em\u00adployee has successfully completed the 30-day in-patient program you pre- scribed, you may make a ''successful compliance'' determination even though you conclude that the employee has not yet completed the out-patient counseling you recommended or should continue in an aftercare program. (d)(1) As the SAP, if you believe, as a result of the follow-up evaluation, that the employee has not demonstrated successful compliance with your rec\u00adommendations, you must provide writ- ten notice directly to the DER (see \u00a740.311(e)). (2) As an employer who receives the SAP's written notice that the em\u00ad ployee has not successfully complied with the SAP's recommendations, you must not return the employee to the performance of safety-sensitive duties. (3) As the SAP, you may conduct ad\u00ad ditional follow-up evaluation(s) if the employer determines that doing so is consistent with the employee's progress as you have reported it and with the employer's policy and/or labor-management agreements. (4) As the employer, following a SAP report that the employee has not dem\u00adonstrated successful compliance, you may take personnel action consistent with your policy and/or labor-manage\u00adment agreements. \u00a7 40.303 What happens if the SAP be\u00ad the employee needs addi\u00ad tional treatment, aftercare, or group services even after theemployee returns to safety-sensitive duties? (a) As a SAP, if you believe that on- going services (in addition to follow-up tests) are needed to assist an employee \u00a740.305 to maintain sobriety or abstinence from drug use after the employee re\u00ad sumes the performance of safety-sen\u00ad sitive duties, you must provide rec\u00adommendations for these services in your follow-up evaluation report (see \u00a740.311(d)(10)). (b) As an employer receiving a rec\u00ad ommendation for these services from a SAP, you may, as part of a return-to- duty agreement with the employee, re-quire the employee to participate in the recommended services. You may monitor and document the employee's participation in the recommended serv\u00adices. You may also make use of SAP and employee assistance program (EAP) services in assisting and moni\u00adtoring employees' compliance with SAP recommendations. Nothing in this section permits an employer to fail to carry out its obligations with respect to follow-up testing (see \u00a7 40.309 ). (c) As an employee, you are obligated to comply with the SAP's rec\u00ad ommendations for these services. If you fail or refuse to do so, you may be subject to disciplinary action by your employer. \u00a7 40.305 How does the return-to-duty process conclude? (a) As the employer, if you decide that you want to permit the employee to return to the performance of safety- sensitive functions, you must ensure that the employee takes a return-to- duty test. This test cannot occur until after the SAP has determined that the employee has successfully complied with prescribed education and/or treat\u00ad ment. The employee must have a nega\u00ad tive drug test result and/or an alcohol test with an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 before resuming perform\u00ad ance of safety-sensitive duties. (b) As an employer, you must not re- turn an employee to safety-sensitive duties until the employee meets the conditions of paragraph (a) of this sec\u00adtion. However, you are not required to return an employee to safety-sensitive duties because the employee has met these conditions. That is a personnel decision that you have the discretion to make, subject to collective bar- gaining agreements or other legal re\u00ad quirements. 647 \u00a740.307 (c) As a SAP or MRO, you must not make a ''fitness for duty'' determina\u00ad tion as part of this re-evaluation unless required to do so under an applicable DOT agency regulation. It is the em\u00ad ployer, rather than you, who must de\u00ad cide whether to put the employee back to work in a safety-sensitive position. \u00a7 40.307 What is the SAP's function in prescribing the employee's follow- up tests? (a) As a SAP, for each employee who has committed a DOT drug or alcohol regulation violation, and who seeks to resume the performance of safety-sen\u00adsitive functions, you must establish a written follow-up testing plan. You do not establish this plan until after you determine that the employee has suc\u00adcessfully complied with your rec\u00ad ommendations for education and/or treatment. (b) You must present a copy of this plan directly to the DER (see \u00a740.311(d)(9)). (c) You are the sole determiner of the number and frequency of follow-up tests and whether these tests will be for drugs, alcohol, or both, unless oth\u00aderwise directed by the appropriate DOT agency regulation. For example, if the employee had a positive drug test, but your evaluation or the treatment pro-gram professionals determined that the employee had an alcohol problem as well, you should require that the em\u00adployee have follow-up tests for both drugs and alcohol. (d) However, you must, at a min\u00ad imum, direct that the employee be sub\u00adject to six unannounced follow-up tests in the first 12 months of safety-sen\u00adsitive duty following the employee's return to safety-sensitive functions. (1) You may require a greater number of follow-up tests during the first 12-month period of safety-sensitive duty (e.g., you may require one test a month during the 12-month period; you may require two tests per month during the first 6-month period and one test per month during the final 6-month pe\u00adriod). (2) You may also require follow-up tests during the 48 months of safety-sensitive duty following this first 12-month period. 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) (3) You are not to establish the ac\u00ad tual dates for the follow-up tests you prescribe. The decision on specific dates to test is the employer's. (4) As the employer, you must not impose additional testing requirements (e.g., under company authority) on the employee that go beyond the SAP's fol\u00ad low-up testing plan. (e) The requirements of the SAP's follow-up testing plan ''follow the em\u00ad ployee'' to subsequent employers or through breaks in service. Example 1 to Paragraph (e): The employee returns to duty with Employer A. Two months afterward, after completing the first two of six follow-up tests required by the SAP's plan, the employee quits his job with Employer A and begins to work in a similar position for Employer B. The employee re-mains obligated to complete the four addi\u00adtional tests during the next 10 months of safety-sensitive duty, and Employer B is re\u00adsponsible for ensuring that the employee does so. Employer B learns of this obligation through the inquiry it makes under \u00a7 40.25. Example 2 to Paragraph (e): The employee returns to duty with Employer A. Three months later, after the employee completes the first two of six follow-up tests required by the SAP's plan, Employer A lays the em\u00ad ployee off for economic or seasonal employ\u00adment reasons. Four months later, Employer A recalls the employee. Employer A must en-sure that the employee completes the re\u00admaining four follow-up tests during the next nine months. (f) As the SAP, you may modify the determinations you have made con\u00ad cerning follow-up tests. For example, even if you recommended follow-up testing beyond the first 12-months, you can terminate the testing requirement at any time after the first year of test\u00ading. You must not, however, modify the requirement that the employee take at least six follow-up tests within the first 12 months after returning to the performance of safety-sensitive functions. \u00a7 40.309 What are the employer's re\u00ad respect to the SAP's directions for follow-up tests? (a) As the employer, you must carry out the SAP's follow-up testing re\u00ad quirements. You may not allow the employee to continue to perform safe\u00ad ty-sensitive functions unless follow-up testing is conducted as directed by the SAP. 648 Office of the Secretary of Transportation (b) You should schedule follow-up tests on dates of your own choosing, but you must ensure that the tests are unannounced with no discernable pat-tern as to their timing, and that the employee is given no advance notice. (c) You cannot substitute any other tests (e.g., those carried out under the random testing program) conducted on the employee for this follow-up testing requirement. (d) You cannot count a follow-up test that has been cancelled as a completed test. A cancelled follow-up test must be recollected. \u00a7 40.311 What are the requirements concerning SAP reports? (a) As the SAP conducting the re\u00ad quired evaluations, you must send the written reports required by this section in writing directly to the DER and not to a third party or entity for for-warding to the DER (except as provided in \u00a7 40.355(e)). You may, however, for- ward the document simultaneously to the DER and to a C/TPA. (b) As an employer, you must ensure that you receive SAP written reports directly from the SAP performing the evaluation and that no third party or entity changed the SAP's report in any way. (c) The SAP's written report, fol\u00ad lowing an initial evaluation that deter-mines what level of assistance is need\u00aded to address the employee's drug and/ or alcohol problems, must be on the SAP's own letterhead (and not the let\u00adterhead of another service agent) signed and dated by the SAP, and must contain the following delineated items: (1) Employee's name and SSN; (2) Employer's name and address; (3) Reason for the assessment (spe\u00ad cific violation of DOT regulations and violation date); (4) Date(s) of the assessment; (5) SAP's education and/or treatment recommendation; and (6) SAP's telephone number. (d) The SAP's written report con\u00ad cerning a follow-up evaluation that de\u00adtermines the employee has dem\u00adonstrated successful compliance must be on the SAP's own letterhead (and not the letterhead of another service agent), signed by the SAP and dated, and must contain the following items: \u00a740.311 (1) Employee's name and SSN; (2) Employer's name and address; (3) Reason for the initial assessment (specific violation of DOT regulations and violation date); (4) Date(s) of the initial assessment and synopsis of the treatment plan; (5) Name of practice(s) or service(s) providing the recommended education and/or treatment; (6) Inclusive dates of employee's pro- gram participation; (7) Clinical characterization of em\u00ad ployee's program participation; (8) SAP's clinical determination as to whether the employee has dem\u00adonstrated successful compliance; (9) Follow-up testing plan; (10) Employee's continuing care needs with specific treatment, aftercare, and/or support group services recommendations; and (11) SAP's telephone number. (e) The SAP's written report con\u00ad cerning a follow-up evaluation that de\u00adtermines the employee has not dem\u00adonstrated successful compliance must be on the SAP's own letterhead (and not the letterhead of another service agent), signed by the SAP and dated, and must contain the following items: (1) Employee's name and SSN; (2) Employer's name and address; (3) Reason for the initial assessment (specific DOT violation and date); (4) Date(s) of initial assessment and synopsis of treatment plan; (5) Name of practice(s) or service(s) providing the recommended education and/or treatment; (6) Inclusive dates of employee's pro- gram participation; (7) Clinical characterization of em\u00ad ployee's participation; of the uation; (9) Date(s) of any further follow-up evaluation the SAP has scheduled; (10) SAP's clinical reasons for deter- mining that the employee has not dem\u00adonstrated successful compliance; and (11) SAP's telephone number. (f) As a SAP, you must also provide these written reports directly to the employee if the employee has no cur-rent employer and to the gaining DOT regulated employer in the event the 649 \u00a740.313 employee obtains another transpor\u00ad tation industry safety-sensitive posi\u00ad tion. (g) As a SAP, you are to maintain copies of your reports to employers for 5 years, and your employee clinical records in accordance with Federal, state, and local laws regarding record maintenance, confidentiality, and re- lease of information. You must make these records available, on request, to DOT agency representatives (e.g., in\u00ad spectors conducting an audit or safety investigation) and representatives of the NTSB in an accident investigation. (h) As an employer, you must main\u00ad tain your reports from SAPs for 5 years from the date you received them. \u00a7 40.313 Where is other information on SAP functions and the return-to- duty process found in this regula\u00ad tion? You can find other information on the role and functions of SAPs in the following sections of this part: \u00a740.3\u2014Definition. of SAP reports. \u00a7 40.329(c)\u2014Making SAP reports available to employees on request. APPENDIX E TO PART 40\u2014SAP E QUIVALENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATION and What is the general confiden\u00ad tiality rule for drug and alcohol test information? Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, as a service agent or employer participating in the DOT drug or alco\u00adhol testing process, you are prohibited from releasing individual test results or medical information about an em\u00adployee to third parties without the em\u00adployee's specific written consent. (a) A ''third party'' is any person or organization to whom other subparts of this regulation do not explicitly au\u00adthorize or require the transmission of information in the course of the drug or alcohol testing process. (b) ''Specific written consent'' means a statement signed by the employee that he or she agrees to the release of a particular piece of information to a 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) particular, explicitly identified, person or organization at a particular time. ''Blanket releases,'' in which an em\u00ad ployee agrees to a release of a category of information (e.g., all test results) or to release information to a category of parties (e.g., other employers who are members of a C/TPA, companies to which the employee may apply for em\u00adployment), are prohibited under this part. \u00a7 40.323 May program participants re- lease drug or alcohol test informa\u00ad tion in connection with legal pro\u00adceedings? (a) As an employer, you may release information pertaining to an employ\u00ad ee's drug or alcohol test without the employee's consent in certain legal proceedings. (1) These proceedings include a law- suit (e.g., a wrongful discharge action), grievance (e.g., an arbitration con\u00ad cerning disciplinary action taken by the employer), or administrative pro\u00adceeding (e.g., an unemployment com\u00ad pensation hearing) brought by, or on behalf of, an employee and resulting from a positive DOT drug or alcohol test or a refusal to test (including, but not limited to, adulterated or sub\u00adstituted test results). (2) These proceedings also include a criminal or civil action resulting from an employee's performance of safety-sensitive duties, in which a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the drug or alcohol test information sought is relevant to the case and issues an order directing the employer to produce the information. For exam\u00adple, in personal injury litigation fol\u00adlowing a truck or bus collision, the court could determine that a post-acci\u00addent drug test result of an employee is relevant to determining whether the driver or the driver's employer was negligent. The employer is authorized to respond to the court's order to produce the records. (b) In such a proceeding, you may re- lease the information to the decision-maker in the proceeding (e.g., the court in a lawsuit). You may release the in-formation only with a binding stipula\u00adtion that the decisionmaker to whom it is released will make it available only to parties to the proceeding. 650 Office of the Secretary of Transportation (c) If you are a service agent, and the employer requests its employee's drug or alcohol testing information from you to use in a legal proceeding as au\u00adthorized in paragraph (a) of this sec\u00ad tion (e.g., the laboratory's data pack- age), you must provide the requested information to the employer. (d) As an employer or service agent, you must immediately notify the em\u00ad ployee in writing of any information you release under this section. \u00a7 40.325 [Reserved] \u00a7 40.327 When must the MRO report medical information gathered in the verification process? (a) As the MRO, you must, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this sec\u00ad tion, report drug test results and med\u00ad ical information you learned as part of the verification process to third parties without the employee's consent if you determine, in your reasonable medical judgment, that: (1) The information is likely to result in the employee being determined to be medically unqualified under an appli\u00ad cable DOT agency regulation; or (2) The information indicates that continued performance by the em\u00ad ployee of his or her safety-sensitive function is likely to pose a significant safety risk. (b) The third parties to whom you are authorized to provide information by this section include the employer, a physician or other health care provider responsible for determining the med\u00ad ical qualifications of the employee under an applicable DOT agency safety regulation, a SAP evaluating the em\u00adployee as part of the return to duty process (see \u00a7 40.293(g)), a DOT agency, or the National Transportation Safety Board in the course of an accident in\u00advestigation. (c) If the law of a foreign country (e.g., Canada) prohibits you from pro\u00ad viding medical information to the em\u00adployer, you may comply with that pro\u00adhibition. \u00a7 40.329 What information must lab- oratories, MROs, and other service agents release to employees? (a) As an MRO or service agent you must provide, within 10 business days of receiving a written request from an \u00a740.331 employee, copies of any records per\u00ad taining to the employee's use of alco\u00ad hol and/or drugs, including records of the employee's DOT-mandated drug and/or alcohol tests. You may charge no more than the cost of preparation and reproduction for copies of these records. (b) As a laboratory, you must pro- vide, within 10 business days of receiv\u00ading a written request from an em\u00adployee, and made through the MRO, the records relating to the results of the employee's drug test (i.e., labora\u00ad tory report and data package). You may charge no more than the cost of preparation and reproduction for copies of these records. (c) As a SAP, you must make avail- able to an employee, on request, a copy of all SAP reports (see \u00a7 40.311). How- ever, you must redact follow-up testing information from the report before pro\u00adviding it to the employee. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41954, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.331 To what additional parties must employers and service agents release information? As an employer or service agent you must release information under the fol\u00ad lowing circumstances: (a) If you receive a specific, written consent from an employee authorizing the release of information about that employee's drug or alcohol tests to an identified person, you must provide the information to the identified person. For example, as an employer, when you receive a written request from a former employee to provide information to a subsequent employer, you must do so. In providing the information, you must comply with the terms of the employ\u00adee's consent. (b) If you are an employer, you must, upon request of DOT agency represent\u00adatives, provide the following: (1) Access to your facilities used for this part and DOT agency drug and al\u00adcohol program functions. (2) All written, printed, and com\u00ad puter-based drug and alcohol program records and reports (including copies of name-specific records or reports), files, materials, data, documents/documenta\u00adtion, agreements, contracts, policies, and statements that are required by 651 \u00a740.333 this part and DOT agency regulations. You must provide this information at your principal place of business in the time required by the DOT agency. (3) All items in paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be easily accessible, legible, and provided in an organized manner. If electronic records do not meet these standards, they must be converted to printed documentation that meets these standards. (c) If you are a service agent, you must, upon request of DOT agency rep\u00adresentatives, provide the following: (1) Access to your facilities used for this part and DOT agency drug and al\u00adcohol program functions. (2) All written, printed, and com\u00ad puter-based drug and alcohol program records and reports (including copies of name-specific records or reports), files, materials, data, documents/documenta\u00adtion, agreements, contracts, policies, and statements that are required by this part and DOT agency regulations. You must provide this information at your principal place of business in the time required by the DOT agency. (3) All items in paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be easily accessible, legible, and provided in an organized manner. If electronic records do not meet these standards, they must be converted to printed documentation that meets these standards. (d) If requested by the National Transportation Safety Board as part of an accident investigation, you must provide information concerning post-accident tests administered after the accident. (e) If requested by a Federal, state or local safety agency with regulatory au\u00adthority over you or the employee, you must provide drug and alcohol test records concerning the employee. (f) Except as otherwise provided in this part, as a laboratory you must not release or provide a specimen or a part of a specimen to a requesting party, without first obtaining written consent from ODAPC. If a party seeks a court order directing you to release a speci\u00admen or part of a specimen contrary to any provision of this part, you must take necessary legal steps to contest the issuance of the order (e.g., seek to quash a subpoena, citing the require\u00adments of \u00a7 40.13 ). This part does not re-49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) quire you to disobey a court order, however. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41955, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.333 What records must employers keep? (a) As an employer, you must keep the following records for the following periods of time: (1) You must keep the following records for five years: (i) Records of alcohol test results in\u00ad dicating an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater; (ii) Records of verified positive drug test results; (iii) Documentation of refusals to take required alcohol and/or drug tests (including substituted or adulterated drug test results); (iv) SAP reports; and (v) All follow-up tests and schedules for follow-up tests. (2) You must keep records for three years of information obtained from previous employers under \u00a7 40.25 con\u00ad cerning drug and alcohol test results of employees. (3) You must keep records of the in\u00ad spection, maintenance, and calibration of EBTs, for two years. (4) You must keep records of negative and cancelled drug test results and al\u00adcohol test results with a concentration of less than 0.02 for one year. (b) You do not have to keep records related to a program requirement that does not apply to you (e.g., a maritime employer who does not have a DOT-mandated random alcohol testing pro-gram need not maintain random alco\u00adhol testing records). (c) You must maintain the records in a location with controlled access. (d) A service agent may maintain these records for you. However, you must ensure that you can produce these records at your principal place of business in the time required by the DOT agency. For example, as a motor carrier, when an FMCSA inspector re-quests your records, you must ensure that you can provide them within two business days. (e) If you store records electroni\u00ad cally, where permitted by this part, you must ensure that the records are 652 Office of the Secretary of Transportation easily accessible, legible, and for- matted and stored in an organized manner. If electronic records do not meet these criteria, you must convert them to printed documentation in a rapid and readily auditable manner, at the request of DOT agency personnel. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41955, Aug. 9, 2001] Subpart Q\u2014Roles and Responsibilities of Service Agents \u00a7 40.341 Must service agents comply with DOT drug and alcohol testing requirements? (a) As a service agent, the services you provide to transportation employ\u00ad ers must meet the requirements of this part and the DOT agency drug and al\u00adcohol testing regulations. (b) If you do not comply, DOT may take action under the Public Interest Exclusions procedures of this part (see Subpart R of this part) or applicable provisions of other DOT agency regula\u00adtions. \u00a7 40.343 What tasks may a service agent perform for an employer? As a service agent, you may perform for employers the tasks needed to com\u00adply with DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulations, subject to the re\u00adquirements and limitations of this part. \u00a7 40.345 In what circumstances may a C/TPA act as an intermediary in the transmission of drug and alcohol testing information to employers? (a) As a C/TPA or other service agent, you may act as an intermediary in the transmission of drug and alcohol testing information in the cir\u00adcumstances specified in this section only if the employer chooses to have you do so. Each employer makes the decision about whether to receive some or all of this information from you, acting as an intermediary, rather than directly from the service agent who originates the information (e.g., an MRO or BAT). (b) The specific provisions of this part concerning which you may act as an intermediary are listed in Appendix F to this part. These are the only situ\u00adations in which you may act as an \u00a740.349 intermediary. You are prohibited from doing so in all other situations. (c) In every case, you must ensure that, in transmitting information to employers, you meet all requirements (e.g., concerning confidentiality and timing) that would apply if the service agent originating the information (e.g., an MRO or collector) sent the informa\u00adtion directly to the employer. For ex-ample, if you transmit drug testing re\u00adsults from MROs to DERs, you must transmit each drug test result to the DER in compliance with the MRO re\u00adquirements set forth in \u00a7 40.167 . \u00a7 40.347 to admin\u00ad istering testing? As a C/TPA, except as otherwise spec\u00ad ified in this part, you may perform the following functions for employers con\u00adcerning random selection and other se\u00adlections for testing. (a) You may operate random testing programs for employers and may assist (i.e., through contracting with labora\u00ad tories or collection sites, conducting collections) employers with other types of testing (e.g., pre-employment, post-accident, reasonable suspicion, re-turn-to-duty, and follow-up). (b) You may combine employees from more than one employer or one trans\u00adportation industry in a random pool if permitted by all the DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulations in\u00advolved. (1) If you combine employees from more than one transportation industry, you must ensure that the random test\u00ading rate is at least equal to the highest rate required by each DOT agency. (2) Employees not covered by DOT agency regulations may not be part of the same random pool with DOT cov\u00adered employees. (c) You may assist employers in en\u00ad suring that follow-up testing is con\u00adducted in accordance with the plan es\u00adtablished by the SAP. However, neither you nor the employer are permitted to randomly select employees from a ''fol\u00ad low-up pool'' for follow-up testing. \u00a7 40.349 What records may a service agent receive and maintain? (a) Except where otherwise specified in this part, as a service agent you may 653 \u00a740.351 receive and maintain all records con\u00ad cerning DOT drug and alcohol testing programs, including positive, negative, and refusal to test individual test re\u00adsults. You do not need the employee's consent to receive and maintain these records. (b) You may maintain all informa\u00ad tion needed for operating a drug/alco\u00adhol program (e.g., CCFs, ATFs, names of employees in random pools, random selection lists, copies of notices to em\u00adployers of selected employees) on be-half of an employer. (c) If a service agent originating drug or alcohol testing information, such as an MRO or BAT, sends the information directly to the DER, he or she may also provide the information simulta\u00adneously to you, as a C/TPA or other service agent who maintains this infor\u00admation for the employer. (d) If you are serving as an inter\u00ad mediary in transmitting information that is required to be provided to the employer, you must ensure that it reaches the employer in the same time periods required elsewhere in this part. (e) You must ensure that you can make available to the employer within two business days any information the employer is asked to produce by a DOT agency representative. (f) On request of an employer, you must, at any time on the request of an employer, transfer immediately all records pertaining to the employer and its employees to the employer or to any other service agent the employer designates. You must carry out this transfer as soon as the employer re-quests it. You are not required to ob\u00adtain employee consent for this trans\u00adfer. You must not charge more than your reasonable administrative costs for conducting this transfer. You may not charge a fee for the release of these records. (g) If you are planning to go out of business or your organization will be bought by or merged with another or\u00adganization, you must immediately no\u00adtify all employers and offer to transfer all records pertaining to the employer and its employees to the employer or to any other service agent the em\u00adployer designates. You must carry out this transfer as soon as the employer requests it. You are not required to ob-49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) tain employee consent for this trans\u00adfer. You must not charge more than your reasonable administrative costs for conducting this transfer. You may not charge a fee for the release of these records. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.351 What confidentiality require\u00ad ments apply to service agents? Except where otherwise specified in this part, as a service agent the fol\u00ad lowing confidentiality requirements apply to you: (a) When you receive or maintain confidential information about em\u00adployees (e.g., individual test results), you must follow the same confiden\u00adtiality regulations as the employer with respect to the use and release of this information. (b) You must follow all confiden\u00ad tiality and records retention require\u00adments applicable to employers. (c) You may not provide individual test results or other confidential infor\u00admation to another employer without a specific, written consent from the em\u00adployee. For example, suppose you are a C/TPA that has employers X and Y as clients. Employee Jones works for X, and you maintain Jones' drug and alco\u00ad hol test for X. Jones wants to change jobs and work for Y. You may not in-form Y of the result of a test conducted for X without having a specific, written consent from Jones. Likewise, you may not provide this information to em\u00adployer Z, who is not a C/TPA member, without this consent. (d) You must not use blanket consent forms authorizing the release of em\u00adployee testing information. (e) You must establish adequate con\u00ad fidentiality and security measures to ensure that confidential employee records are not available to unauthor\u00adized persons. This includes protecting the physical security of records, access controls, and computer security meas\u00adures to safeguard confidential data in electronic data bases. \u00a7 40.353 What principles govern the interaction between MROs and other service agents? As a service agent other than an MRO (e.g., a C/TPA), the following 654 Office of the Secretary of Transportation principles govern your interaction with MROs: (a) You may provide MRO services to employers, directly or through con- tract, if you meet all applicable provi\u00ad sions of this part. (b) If you employ or contract for an MRO, the MRO must perform duties independently and confidentially. When you have a relationship with an MRO, you must structure the relation- ship to ensure that this independence and confidentiality are not com\u00adpromised. Specific means (including both physical and operational meas\u00ad ures, as appropriate) to separate MRO functions and other service agent func\u00adtions are essential. (c) Only your staff who are actually under the day-to-day supervision and control of an MRO with respect to MRO functions may perform these functions. This does not mean that those staff may not perform other functions at other times. However, the designation of your staff to perform MRO functions under MRO supervision must be limited and not used as a sub\u00ad terfuge to circumvent confidentiality and other requirements of this part and DOT agency regulations. You must en- sure that MRO staff operate under con\u00adtrols sufficient to ensure that the inde\u00ad pendence and confidentiality of the MRO process are not compromised. (d) Like other MROs, an MRO you employ or contract with must person- ally conduct verification interviews with employees and must personally make all verification decisions. Con\u00adsequently, your staff cannot perform these functions. \u00a7 40.355 What limitations apply to the activities of service agents? As a service agent, you are subject to the following limitations concerning your activities in the DOT drug and al\u00adcohol testing program. (a) You must not require an em\u00ad ployee to sign a consent, release, waiv\u00ader of liability, or indemnification agreement with respect to any part of the drug or alcohol testing process cov\u00adered by this part (including, but not limited to, collections, laboratory test\u00ading, MRO, and SAP services). No one may do so on behalf of a service agent. \u00a740.355 (b) You must not act as an inter\u00ad mediary in the transmission of drug test results from the laboratory to the MRO. That is, the laboratory may not send results to you, with you in turn sending them to the MRO for verification. For example, a practice in which the laboratory transmits results to your computer system, and you then assign the results to a particular MRO, is not permitted. (c) You must not transmit drug test results directly from the laboratory to the employer (by electronic or other means) or to a service agent who for- wards them to the employer. All con- firmed laboratory results must be proc\u00adessed by the MRO before they are re- leased to any other party. (d) You must not act as an inter\u00ad mediary in the transmission of alcohol test results of 0.02 or higher from the STT or BAT to the DER. (e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, you must not act as an intermediary in the transmission of individual SAP reports to the actual employer. That is, the SAP may not send such reports to you, with you in turn sending them to the actual em\u00ad ployer. However, you may maintain in\u00ad dividual SAP summary reports and fol\u00ad low-up testing plans after they are sent to the DER, and the SAP may transmit such reports to you simultaneously with sending them to the DER. (f) As an exception to paragraph (e) of this section, you may act as an intermediary in the transmission of SAP report from the SAP to an owner- operator or other self-employed indi\u00ad vidual. (g) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, you must not make decisions to test an employee based upon reasonable suspicion, post-acci\u00ad dent, return-to-duty, and follow-up de- termination criteria. These are duties the actual employer cannot delegate to a C/TPA. You may, however, provide advice and information to employers regarding these testing issues and how the employer should schedule required testing. (h) As an exception to paragraph (g) of this section, you may make deci\u00ad sions to test an employee based upon 655 \u00a740.361 reasonable suspicion, post-accident, re- turn-to-duty, and follow-up determina\u00ad tion criteria with respect to an owner- operator or other self-employed indi\u00advidual. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, you must not make a determination that an employee has refused a drug or alcohol test. This is a non-delegable duty of the actual em\u00ad ployer. You may, however, provide ad- vice and information to employers re\u00adgarding refusal-to-test issues. (j) As an exception to paragraph (i) of this section, you may make a deter\u00ad mination that an employee has refused a drug or alcohol test, if: (1) You schedule a required test for an owner-operator or other self-em\u00ad ployed individual, and the individual fails to appear for the test without a legitimate reason; or (2) As an MRO, you determine that an individual has refused to test on the basis of adulteration or substitution. (k) You must not act as a DER. For example, while you may be responsible for transmitting information to the employer about test results, you must not act on behalf of the employer in ac\u00adtions to remove employees from safety-sensitive duties. (l) In transmitting documents to lab- oratories, you must ensure that you send to the laboratory that conducts testing only the laboratory copy of the CCF. You must not transmit other cop\u00adies of the CCF or any ATFs to the lab-oratory. (m) You must not impose conditions or requirements on employers that DOT regulations do not authorize. For example, as a C/TPA serving employers in the pipeline or motor carrier indus\u00adtry, you must not require employers to have provisions in their DOT plans that RSPA or FMCSA regulations do not require. (n) You must not intentionally delay the transmission of drug or alcohol testing-related documents concerning actions you have performed, because of a payment dispute or other reasons. Example 1 to Paragraph (n): A laboratory that has tested a specimen must not delay transmitting the documentation of the test result to an MRO because of a billing or pay\u00ad ment dispute with the MRO or a C/TPA. 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) Example 2 to Paragraph (n): An MRO or SAP who has interviewed an employee must not delay sending a verified test result or SAP report to the employer because of such a dis\u00adpute with the employer or employee. Example 3 to Paragraph (n): A collector who has performed a urine specimen collection must not delay sending the drug specimen and CCF to the laboratory because of a pay\u00adment or other dispute with the laboratory or a C/TPA. Example 4 to Paragraph (n): A BAT who has conducted an alcohol test must not delay sending test result information to an em\u00adployer or C/TPA because of a payment or other dispute with the employer or C/TPA. (o) While you must follow the DOT agency regulations, the actual em\u00ad ployer remains accountable to DOT for compliance, and your failure to imple\u00adment any aspect of the program as re\u00adquired in this part and other applicable DOT agency regulations makes the em\u00adployer subject to enforcement action by the Department. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 Aug. 9, 2001] Subpart R\u2014Public Interest Exclusions \u00a7 40.361 What is the purpose of a pub\u00ad lic interest exclusion (PIE)? (a) To protect the public interest, in\u00ad cluding protecting transportation em\u00ad ployers and employees from serious noncompliance with DOT drug and al\u00adcohol testing rules, the Department's policy is to ensure that employers con-duct business only with responsible service agents. (b) The Department therefore uses PIEs to exclude from participation in DOT's drug and alcohol testing pro-gram any service agent who, by serious noncompliance with this part or other DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulations, has shown that it is not currently acting in a responsible man\u00adner. (c) A PIE is a serious action that the Department takes only to protect the public interest. We intend to use PIEs only to remedy situations of serious noncompliance. PIEs are not used for the purpose of punishment. (d) Nothing in this subpart precludes a DOT agency or the Inspector General from taking other action authorized by its regulations with respect to service 656 Office of the Secretary of Transportation agents or employers that violate its regulations. \u00a7 40.363 On what basis may the De\u00ad partment issue a PIE? (a) If you are a service agent, the De\u00ad partment may issue a PIE concerning you if we determine that you have failed or refused to provide drug or al\u00adcohol testing services consistent with the requirements of this part or a DOT agency drug and alcohol regulation. (b) The Department also may issue a PIE if you have failed to cooperate with DOT agency representatives con\u00adcerning inspections, complaint inves\u00adtigations, compliance and enforcement reviews, or requests for documents and other information about compliance with this part or DOT agency drug and alcohol regulations. \u00a7 40.365 What is the Department's pol- icy concerning starting a PIE pro\u00ad ceeding? (a) It is the Department's policy to start a PIE proceeding only in cases of serious, uncorrected noncompliance with the provisions of this part, affect\u00ading such matters as safety, the out-comes of test results, privacy and con\u00adfidentiality, due process and fairness for employees, the honesty and integ\u00adrity of the testing program, and co\u00adoperation with or provision of informa\u00adtion to DOT agency representatives. (b) The following are examples of the kinds of serious noncompliance that, as a matter of policy, the Department views as appropriate grounds for start\u00ading a PIE proceeding. These examples are not intended to be an exhaustive or exclusive list of the grounds for start\u00ading a PIE proceeding. We intend them to illustrate the level of seriousness that the Department believes supports starting a PIE proceeding. The exam\u00adples follow: (1) For an MRO, verifying tests posi\u00ad tive without interviewing the employ\u00adees as required by this part or pro\u00adviding MRO services without meeting the qualifications for an MRO required by this part; (2) For a laboratory, refusing to pro- vide information to the Department, an employer, or an employee as re\u00adquired by this part; failing or refusing to conduct a validity testing program \u00a740.365 when required by this part; or a pat-tern or practice of testing errors that result in the cancellation of tests. (As a general matter of policy, the Depart\u00adment does not intend to initiate a PIE proceeding concerning a laboratory with respect to matters on which HHS initiates certification actions under its laboratory guidelines.); (3) For a collector, a pattern or prac\u00ad tice of directly observing collections when doing so is unauthorized, or fail\u00ading or refusing to directly observe col\u00adlections when doing so is mandatory; (4) For collectors, BATs, or STTs, a pattern or practice of using forms, testing equipment, or collection kits that do not meet the standards in this part; (5) For a collector, BAT, or STT, a pattern or practice of ''fatal flaws'' or other significant uncorrected errors in the collection process; (6) For a laboratory, MRO or C/TPA, failing or refusing to report tests re\u00adsults as required by this part or DOT agency regulations; (7) For a laboratory, falsifying, con\u00ad cealing, or destroying documentation concerning any part of the drug testing process, including, but not limited to, documents in a ''litigation package''; (8) For SAPs, providing SAP services while not meeting SAP qualifications required by this part or performing evaluations without face-to-face inter-views; (9) For any service agent, maintain\u00ad ing a relationship with another party that constitutes a conflict of interest under this part (e.g., a laboratory that derives a financial benefit from having an employer use a specific MRO); (10) For any service agent, rep\u00ad resenting falsely that the service agent or its activities is approved or certified by the Department or a DOT agency; (11) For any service agent, disclosing an employee's test result information to any party this part or a DOT agency regulation does not authorize, includ\u00ading by obtaining a ''blanket'' consent from employees or by creating a data base from which employers or others can retrieve an employee's DOT test results without the specific consent of the employee; (12) For any service agent, inter\u00ad fering or attempting to interfere with 657 \u00a740.367 the ability of an MRO to communicate with the Department, or retaliating against an MRO for communicating with the Department; (13) For any service agent, directing or recommending that an employer fail or refuse to implement any provision of this part; or (14) With respect to noncompliance with a DOT agency regulation, conduct that affects important provisions of Department-wide concern (e.g., failure to properly conduct the selection proc\u00ad ess for random testing). \u00a7 40.367 Who initiates a PIE pro\u00ad ceeding? The following DOT officials may ini\u00ad tiate a PIE proceeding: (a) The drug and alcohol program manager of a DOT agency; (b) An official of ODAPC, other than the Director; or (c) The designee of any of these offi\u00ad cials. \u00a7 40.369 What is the discretion of an initiating official in starting a PIE proceeding? (a) Initiating officials have broad dis\u00ad cretion in deciding whether to start a PIE proceeding. (b) In exercising this discretion, the initiating official must consider the Department's policy regarding the seri\u00ad ousness of the service agent's conduct (see \u00a7 40.365) and all information he or she has obtained to this point con\u00adcerning the facts of the case. The initi\u00adating official may also consider the availability of the resources needed to pursue a PIE proceeding. (c) A decision not to initiate a PIE proceeding does not necessarily mean that the Department regards a service agent as being in compliance or that the Department may not use other ap\u00ad plicable remedies in a situation of non- compliance. \u00a7 40.371 On what information does an initiating official rely in deciding whether to start a PIE proceeding? (a) An initiating official may rely on credible information from any source as the basis for starting a PIE pro\u00ad ceeding. (b) Before sending a correction notice (see \u00a7 40.373), the initiating official in- formally contacts the service agent to 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) determine if there is any information that may affect the initiating official's determination about whether it is nec\u00adessary to send a correction notice. The initiating official may take any infor\u00admation resulting from this contact into account in determining whether to proceed under this subpart. \u00a7 40.373 Before starting a PIE pro\u00ad ceeding, does the initiating official give the service agent an oppor\u00adtunity to correct problems? (a) If you are a service agent, the ini\u00ad tiating official must send you a correc\u00ad tion notice before starting a PIE pro\u00adceeding. (b) The correction notice identifies the specific areas in which you must come into compliance in order to avoid being subject to a PIE proceeding. (c) If you make and document changes needed to come into compli\u00adance in the areas listed in the correc\u00adtion notice to the satisfaction of the initiating official within 60 days of the date you receive the notice, the initi\u00adating official does not start a PIE pro\u00adceeding. The initiating official may conduct appropriate fact finding to verify that you have made and main\u00adtained satisfactory corrections. When he or she is satisfied that you are in compliance, the initiating official sends you a notice that the matter is concluded. \u00a7 40.375 How does the initiating offi\u00ad cial start a PIE proceeding? (a) As a service agent, if your compli\u00ad ance matter is not correctable (see \u00a7 40.373(a)), or if have not resolved com\u00ad pliance matters as provided in \u00a7 40.373(c), the initiating official starts a PIE proceeding by sending you a no\u00adtice of proposed exclusion (NOPE). The NOPE contains the initiating official's recommendations concerning the issuance of a PIE, but it is not a deci\u00adsion by the Department to issue a PIE. (b) The NOPE includes the following information: (1) A statement that the initiating official is recommending that the De\u00adpartment issue a PIE concerning you; (2) The factual basis for the initi\u00ad ating official's belief that you are not providing drug and/or alcohol testing services to DOT-regulated employers 658 Office of the Secretary of Transportation consistent with the requirements of this part or are in serious noncompli\u00adance with a DOT agency drug and alco\u00adhol regulation; (3) The factual basis for the initi\u00ad ating official's belief that your non-compliance has not been or cannot be corrected; (4) The initiating official's rec\u00ad ommendation for the scope of the PIE; (5) The initiating official's rec\u00ad ommendation for the duration of the PIE; and (6) A statement that you may contest the issuance of the proposed PIE, as provided in \u00a7 40.379. (c) The initiating official sends a copy of the NOPE to the ODAPC Direc\u00adtor at the same time he or she sends the NOPE to you. \u00a7 40.377 Who decides whether to issue a PIE? (a) The ODAPC Director, or his or her designee, decides whether to issue a PIE. If a designee is acting as the deci\u00adsionmaker, all references in this sub-part to the Director refer to the des\u00adignee. (b) To ensure his or her impartiality, the Director plays no role in the initi\u00adating official's determination about whether to start a PIE proceeding. (c) There is a ''firewall'' between the initiating official and the Director. This means that the initiating official and the Director are prohibited from having any discussion, contact, or ex-change of information with one an-other about the matter, except for doc\u00aduments and discussions that are part of the record of the proceeding. \u00a7 40.379 How do you contest the issuance of a PIE? (a) If you receive a NOPE, you may contest the issuance of the PIE. (b) If you want to contest the pro- posed PIE, you must provide the Direc\u00adtor information and argument in oppo\u00adsition to the proposed PIE in writing, in person, and/or through a representa\u00adtive. To contest the proposed PIE, you must take one or more of the steps list\u00aded in this paragraph (b) within 30 days after you receive the NOPE. (1) You may request that the Direc\u00ad tor dismiss the proposed PIE without further proceedings, on the basis that \u00a740.383 it does not concern serious noncompli\u00ad ance with this part or DOT agency reg\u00ad ulations, consistent with the Depart\u00ad ment's policy as stated in \u00a7 40.365. (2) You may present written informa\u00ad tion and arguments, consistent with the provisions of \u00a7 40.381, contesting the proposed PIE. (3) You may arrange with the Direc\u00ad tor for an informal meeting to present your information and arguments. (c) If you do not take any of the ac\u00ad tions listed in paragraph (b) of this sec\u00adtion within 30 days after you receive the NOPE, the matter proceeds as an uncontested case. In this event, the Di\u00adrector makes his or her decision based on the record provided by the initi\u00ad ating official (i.e., the NOPE and any supporting information or testimony) and any additional information the Di\u00adrector obtains. \u00a7 40.381 What information do you present to contest the proposed issuance of a PIE? (a) As a service agent who wants to contest a proposed PIE, you must present at least the following informa\u00ad tion to the Director: (1) Specific facts that contradict the statements contained in the NOPE (see \u00a7 40.375(b)(2) and (3)). A general denial is insufficient to raise a genuine dispute over facts material to the issuance of a PIE; (2) Identification of any existing, pro- posed or prior PIE; and (3) Identification of your affiliates, if any. (b) You may provide any information and arguments you wish concerning the proposed issuance, scope and dura\u00ad tion of the PIE (see \u00a7 40.375(b)(4) and (5)). (c) You may provide any additional relevant information or arguments concerning any of the issues in the matter. \u00a7 40.383 What procedures apply if you contest the issuance of a PIE? (a) DOT conducts PIE proceedings in a fair and informal manner. The Direc\u00ad tor may use flexible procedures to allow you to present matters in opposi\u00ad tion. The Director is not required to 659 \u00a740.385 follow formal rules of evidence or pro\u00ad cedure in creating the record of the proceeding. (b) The Director will consider any in- formation or argument he or she deter-mines to be relevant to the decision on the matter. (c) You may submit any documen\u00ad tary evidence you want the Director to consider. In addition, if you have ar\u00ad ranged an informal meeting with the Director, you may present witnesses and confront any person the initiating official presents as a witness against you. (d) In cases where there are material factual issues in dispute, the Director or his or her designee may conduct ad\u00ad ditional fact-finding. (e) If you have arranged a meeting with the Director, the Director will make a transcribed record of the meet\u00ad ing available to you on your request. You must pay the cost of transcribing and copying the meeting record. \u00a7 40.385 Who bears the burden of proof in a PIE proceeding? (a) As the proponent of issuing a PIE, the initiating official bears the burden of proof. (b) This burden is to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the service agent was in serious non-compliance with the requirements of this part for drug and/or alcohol test\u00ading-related services or with the re\u00adquirements of another DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulation. \u00a7 40.387 What matters does the Direc\u00ad tor decide concerning a proposed PIE? (a) Following the service agent's re\u00ad sponse (see \u00a7 40.379(b)) or, if no response is received, after 30 days have passed from the date on which the service agent received the NOPE, the Director may take one of the following steps: (1) In response to a request from the service agent (see \u00a7 40.379(b)(1)) or on his or her own motion, the Director may dismiss a PIE proceeding if he or she determines that it does not concern serious noncompliance with this part or DOT agency regulations, consistent with the Department's policy as stated in \u00a7 40.365. 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) (i) If the Director dismisses a pro- posed PIE under this paragraph (a), the action is closed with respect to the noncompliance alleged in the NOPE. (ii) The Department may initiate a new PIE proceeding against you on the basis of different or subsequent con-duct that is in noncompliance with this part or other DOT drug and alcohol testing rules. (2) If the Director determines that the initiating official's submission does not have complete information needed for a decision, the Director may re\u00admand the matter to the initiating offi\u00adcial. The initiating official may resub\u00admit the matter to the Director when the needed information is complete. If the basis for the proposed PIE has changed, the initiating official must send an amended NOPE to the service agent. (b) The Director makes determina\u00ad tions concerning the following matters in any PIE proceeding that he or she decides on the merits: (1) Any material facts that are in dis\u00ad pute; (2) Whether the facts support issuing a PIE; (3) The scope of any PIE that is issued; and (4) The duration of any PIE that is issued. \u00a7 40.389 What factors may the Director consider? This section lists examples of the kind of mitigating and aggravating factors that the Director may consider in determining whether to issue a PIE concerning you, as well as the scope and duration of a PIE. This list is not exhaustive or exclusive. The Director may consider other factors if appro\u00adpriate in the circumstances of a par\u00adticular case. The list of examples fol\u00adlows: (a) The actual or potential harm that results or may result from your non-compliance; (b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the noncompliance; (c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of noncompliance; (d) Whether the noncompliance was pervasive within your organization, in\u00adcluding such factors as the following: 660 Office of the Secretary of Transportation (1) Whether and to what extent your organization planned, initiated, or car\u00ad ried out the noncompliance; (2) The positions held by individuals involved in the noncompliance, and whether your principals tolerated their noncompliance; and (3) Whether you had effective stand\u00ad ards of conduct and control systems (both with respect to your own organi\u00adzation and any contractors or affili\u00adates) at the time the noncompliance occurred; (e) Whether you have demonstrated an appropriate compliance disposition, including such factors as the following: (1) Whether you have accepted re\u00ad sponsibility for the noncompliance and recognize the seriousness of the con-duct that led to the cause for issuance of the PIE; (2) Whether you have cooperated fully with the Department during the investigation. The Director may con\u00adsider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent in-formation known to you; (3) Whether you have fully inves\u00ad tigated the circumstances of the non-compliance forming the basis for the PIE and, if so, have made the result of the investigation available to the Di\u00adrector; (4) Whether you have taken appro\u00ad priate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the activity that constitutes the grounds for issuance of the PIE; and (5) Whether your organization has taken appropriate corrective actions or remedial measures, including imple\u00admenting actions to prevent recurrence; (f) With respect to noncompliance with a DOT agency regulation, the de\u00adgree to which the noncompliance af\u00adfects matters common to the DOT drug and alcohol testing program; (g) Other factors appropriate to the circumstances of the case. \u00a7 40.391 What is the scope of a PIE? (a) The scope of a PIE is the Depart\u00ad ment's determination about the divi\u00adsions, organizational elements, types of services, affiliates, and/or individuals (including direct employees of a service agent and its contractors) to which a PIE applies. \u00a740.391 (b) If, as a service agent, the Depart\u00ad ment issues a PIE concerning you, the PIE applies to all your divisions, orga\u00adnizational elements, and types of serv\u00adices that are involved with or affected by the noncompliance that forms the factual basis for issuing the PIE. (c) In the NOPE (see \u00a7 40.375(b)(4)), the initiating official sets forth his or her recommendation for the scope of the PIE. The proposed scope of the PIE is one of the elements of the proceeding that the service agent may contest (see \u00a7 40.381(b)) and about which the Direc\u00ad tor makes a decision (see \u00a7 40.387(b)(3)). (d) In recommending and deciding the scope of the PIE, the initiating of\u00adficial and Director, respectively, must take into account the provisions of paragraphs (e) through (j) of this sec\u00adtion. (e) The pervasiveness of the non- compliance within a agent's or\u00adganization (see \u00a7 40.389(d)) is an impor\u00ad tant consideration in determining the scope of a PIE. The appropriate scope of a PIE grows broader as the perva\u00adsiveness of the noncompliance in-creases. (f) The application of a PIE is not limited to the specific location or em\u00adployer at which the conduct that forms the factual basis for issuing the PIE was discovered. (g) A PIE applies to your affiliates, if the affiliate is involved with or af\u00adfected by the conduct that forms the factual basis for issuing the PIE. (h) A PIE applies to individuals who are officers, employees, directors, shareholders, partners, or other indi\u00adviduals associated with your organiza\u00adtion in the following circumstances: (1) Conduct forming any part of the factual basis of the PIE occurred in connection with the individual's per\u00ad formance of duties by or on behalf of your organization; or (2) The individual knew of, had rea\u00ad son to know of, approved, or acquiesced in such conduct. The individual's ac\u00adceptance of benefits derived from such conduct is evidence of such knowledge, acquiescence, or approval. (i) If a contractor to your organiza\u00ad tion is solely responsible for the con-duct that forms the factual basis for a PIE, the PIE does not apply to the service agent itself unless the service 661 \u00a740.393 agent knew or should have known about the conduct and did not take ac\u00ad tion to correct it. (j) PIEs do not apply to drug and al\u00ad cohol testing that DOT does not regu\u00adlate. (k) The following examples illustrate how the Department intends the provi\u00adsions of this section to work: Example 1 to \u00a7 40.391. Service Agent P pro\u00ad vides a variety of drug testing services. P's SAP services are involved in a serious viola\u00ad tion of this Part 40. However, P's other serv\u00ad ices fully comply with this part, and P 's overall management did not plan or concur in the noncompliance, which in fact was con\u00adtrary to P's articulated standards. Because the noncompliance was isolated in one area of the organization's activities, and did not pervade the entire organization, the scope of the PIE could be limited to SAP services. Example 2 to \u00a7 40.391. Service Agent Q pro\u00ad vides a similar variety of services. The con-duct forming the factual basis for a PIE con\u00adcerns collections for a transit authority. As in Example 1, the noncompliance is not per\u00ad vasive throughout Q's organization. The PIE would apply to collections at all locations served by Q, not just the particular transit authority or not just in the state in which the transit authority is located. Example 3 to \u00a7 40.391. Service Agent R pro\u00ad vides a similar array of services. One or more of the following problems exists: R's activi\u00adties in several areas\u2014collections, MROs, SAPs, protecting the confidentiality of in\u00ad formation\u2014are involved in serious non-compliance; DOT determines that R's man\u00ad agement knew or should have known about serious noncompliance in one or more areas, but management did not take timely correc\u00adtive action; or, in response to an inquiry from DOT personnel, R's management re- fuses to provide information about its oper\u00ad ations. In each of these three cases, the scope of the PIE would include all aspects of R's services. Example 4 to \u00a7 40.391. Service Agent W pro\u00ad vides only one kind of service (e.g., labora\u00ad tory or MRO services). The Department issues a PIE concerning these services. Be- cause W only provides this one kind of serv\u00ad ice, the PIE necessarily applies to all its op\u00aderations. Example 5 to \u00a7 40.391. Service Agent X, by exercising reasonably prudent oversight of its collection contractor, should have known that the contractor was making numerous ''fatal flaws'' in tests. Alternatively, X re\u00ad ceived a correction notice pointing out these problems in its contractor's collections. In neither case did X take action to correct the problem. X, as well as the contractor, would be subject to a PIE with respect to collec\u00adtions. 49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) Example 6 to \u00a7 40.391. Service Agent Y could not reasonably have known that one of its MROs was regularly failing to interview em\u00ad ployees before verifying tests positive. When it received a correction notice, Y imme\u00ad diately dismissed the erring MRO. In this case, the MRO would be subject to a PIE but Y would not. Example 7 to \u00a7 40.391. The Department issues a PIE with respect to Service Agent Z. Z pro\u00ad vides services for DOT-regulated transpor\u00ad tation employers, a Federal agency under the HHS-regulated Federal employee testing program, and various private businesses and public agencies that DOT does not regulate. The PIE applies only to the DOT-regulated transportation employers with respect to their DOT-mandated testing, not to the Fed\u00aderal agency or the other public agencies and private businesses. The PIE does not prevent the non-DOT regulated entities from con\u00adtinuing to use Z's services. \u00a7 40.393 How long does a PIE stay in effect? (a) In the NOPE (see \u00a7 40.375(b)(5)), the initiating official proposes the du\u00ad ration of the PIE. The duration of the PIE is one of the elements of the pro\u00adceeding that the service agent may contest (see \u00a7 40.381(b)) and about which the Director makes a decision (see \u00a740.387(b)(4)). (b) In deciding upon the duration of the PIE, the Director considers the se\u00adriousness of the conduct on which the PIE is based and the continued need to protect employers and employees from the service agent's noncompliance. The Director considers factors such as those listed in \u00a7 40.389 in making this decision. (c) The duration of a PIE will be be- tween one and five years, unless the Di\u00adrector reduces its duration under \u00a740.407. \u00a7 40.395 Can you settle a PIE pro\u00ad ceeding? At any time before the Director's de\u00ad cision, you and the initiating official can, with the Director's concurrence, settle a PIE proceeding. \u00a7 40.397 When does the Director make a PIE decision? The Director makes his or her deci\u00ad sion within 60 days of the date when the record of a PIE proceeding is com\u00adplete (including any meeting with the 662 Office of the Secretary of Transportation Director and any additional fact-find\u00ad ing that is necessary). The Director may extend this period for good cause for additional periods of up to 30 days. \u00a7 40.399 How does the Department no\u00ad tify service agents of its decision? If you are a service agent involved in a PIE proceeding, the Director provides you written notice as soon as he or she makes a PIE decision. The notice in\u00adcludes the following elements: (a) If the decision is not to issue a PIE, a statement of the reasons for the decision, including findings of fact with respect to any material factual issues that were in dispute. (b) If the decision is to issue a PIE\u2014 (1) A reference to the NOPE; (2) A statement of the reasons for the decision, including findings of fact with respect to any material factual issues that were in dispute; (3) A statement of the scope of the PIE; and (4) A statement of the duration of the PIE. \u00a7 40.401 How does the Department no\u00ad tify employers and the public about a PIE? (a) The Department maintains a doc\u00ad ument called the ''List of Excluded Drug and Alcohol Service Agents.'' This document may be found on the Department's web site (http:// www.dot.gov/ost/dapc). You may also request a copy of the document from ODAPC. (b) When the Director issues a PIE, he or she adds to the List the name and address of the service agent, and any other persons or organizations, to whom the PIE applies and information about the scope and duration of the PIE. (c) When a service agent ceases to be subject to a PIE, the Director removes this information from the List. (d) The Department also publishes a FEDERAL REGISTER notice to inform the public on any occasion on which a service agent is added to or taken off the List. \u00a7 40.403 Must a service agent notify its clients when the Department issues a PIE? (a) As a service agent, if the Depart\u00ad ment issues a PIE concerning you, you \u00a740.407 must notify each of your DOT-regu\u00ad lated employer clients, in writing, about the issuance, scope, duration, and effect of the PIE. You may meet this requirement by sending a copy of the Director's PIE decision or by a sep\u00ad arate notice. You must send this notice to each client within three business days of receiving from the Department the notice provided for in \u00a7 40.399(b). (b) As part of the notice you send under paragraph (a) of this section, you must offer to transfer immediately all records pertaining to the employer and its employees to the employer or to any other service agent the employer designates. You must carry out this transfer as soon as the employer re-quests it. [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as 66 FR 41955, Aug. 9, 2001] \u00a7 40.405 May the Federal courts review PIE decisions? The Director's decision is a final ad\u00ad ministrative action of the Department. Like all final administrative actions of Federal agencies, the Director's deci\u00ad sion is subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et. seq). \u00a7 40.407 May a service agent ask to have a PIE reduced or terminated? (a) Yes, as a service agent concerning whom the Department has issued a PIE, you may request that the Director terminate a PIE or reduce its duration and/or scope. This process is limited to the issues of duration and scope. It is not an appeal or reconsideration of the decision to issue the PIE. (b) Your request must be in writing and supported with documentation. (c) You must wait at least nine months from the date on which the Di\u00adrector issued the PIE to make this re-quest. (d) The initiating official who was the proponent of the PIE may provide information and arguments concerning your request to the Director. (e) If the Director verifies that the sources of your noncompliance have been eliminated and that all drug or al\u00adcohol testing-related services you would provide to DOT-regulated em\u00adployers will be consistent with the re\u00adquirements of this part, the Director 663 \u00a740.409 may issue a notice terminating or re\u00ad ducing the PIE. \u00a7 40.409 What does the issuance of a PIE mean to transportation employ\u00ad ers? (a) As an employer, you are deemed to have notice of the issuance of a PIE when it appears on the List mentioned in \u00a7 40.401(a) or the notice of the PIE appears in the F EDERAL REGISTER as provided in \u00a7 40.401(d). You should check this List to ensure that any service agents you are using or plan\u00adning to use are not subject to a PIE. (b) As an employer who is using a service agent concerning whom a PIE is issued, you must stop using the serv\u00adices of the service agent no later than 90 days after the Department has pub\u00adlished the decision in the F EDERAL REGISTER or posted it on its web site. You may apply to the ODAPC Director for an extension of 30 days if you dem\u00adonstrate that you cannot find a sub\u00adstitute service agent within 90 days. (c) Except during the period provided in paragraph (b) of this section, you must not, as an employer, use the serv\u00adices of a service agent that are covered by a PIE that the Director has issued under this subpart. If you do so, you are in violation of the Department's regulations and subject to applicable DOT agency sanctions (e.g., civil pen\u00ad alties, withholding of Federal financial assistance). (d) You also must not obtain drug or alcohol testing services through a con-tractor or affiliate of the service agent to whom the PIE applies. Example to Paragraph (d): Service Agent R was subject to a PIE with respect to SAP services. As an employer, not only must you not use R's own SAP services, but you also must not use SAP services you arrange through R, such as services provided by a subcontractor or affiliate of R or a person or organization that receives financial gain from its relationship with R. (e) This section's prohibition on using the services of a service agent concerning which the Director has issued a PIE applies to employers in all industries subject to DOT drug and al\u00adcohol testing regulations. Example to Paragraph (e): The initiating of\u00ad ficial for a PIE was the FAA drug and alco\u00ad hol program manager, and the conduct form-49 CFR Subtitle A (10-1-01 Edition) ing the basis of the PIE pertained to the aviation industry. As a motor carrier, tran\u00ad sit authority, pipeline, railroad, or maritime employer, you are also prohibited from using the services of the service agent involved in connection with the DOT drug and alcohol testing program. (f) The issuance of a PIE does not re\u00ad sult in the cancellation of drug or alco\u00ad hol tests conducted using the service agent involved before the issuance of the Director's decision or up to 90 days following its publication in the F ED\u00ad ERAL REGISTER or posting on the De\u00ad partment's web site, unless otherwise specified in the Director's PIE decision or the Director grants an extension as provided in paragraph (b) of this sec\u00ad tion. Example to Paragraph (f): The Department issues a PIE concerning Service Agent N on September 1. All tests conducted using N's services before September 1, and through No\u00advember 30, are valid for all purposes under DOT drug and alcohol testing regulations, assuming they meet all other regulatory re\u00ad quirements. \u00a7 40.411 What is the role of the DOT In\u00ad spector General's office? (a) Any person may bring concerns about waste, fraud, or abuse on the part of a service agent to the attention of the DOT Office of Inspector General. (b) In appropriate cases, the Office of Inspector General may pursue criminal or civil remedies against a service agent. (c) The Office of Inspector General may provide factual information to other DOT officials for use in a PIE proceeding. \u00a7 40.413 How are notices sent to serv\u00ad ice agents? (a) If you are a service agent, DOT sends notices to you, including correc\u00ad tion notices, notices of proposed exclu\u00ad sion, decision notices, and other no\u00ad tices, in any of the ways mentioned in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. (b) DOT may send a notice to you, your identified counsel, your agent for service of process, or any of your part\u00adners, officers, directors, owners, or joint venturers to the last known street address, fax number, or e-mail address. DOT deems the notice to have 664 Office of the Secretary of Transportation been received by you if sent to any of these persons. (c) DOT considers notices to be re\u00ad ceived by you\u2014 (1) When delivered, if DOT mails the notice to the last known street ad-dress, or five days after we send it if the letter is undeliverable; (2) When sent, if DOT sends the no\u00ad tice by fax or five days after we send it if the fax is undeliverable; or (3) When delivered, if DOT sends the notice by e-mail or five days after DOT sends it if the e-mail is undeliverable. APPENDIX A TO PART 40\u2014DOT STANDARDS FOR URINE COLLECTION KITS The Collection Kit Contents 1. Collection Container a. Single-use container, made of plastic, large enough to easily catch and hold at least 55 mL of urine voided from the body. b. Must have graduated volume markings clearly noting levels of 45 mL and above. c. Must have a temperature strip providing graduated temperature readings 32-38 \u00b0C/90- 100 \u00b0F, that is affixed or can be affixed at a proper level on the outside of the collection container. Other methodologies (e.g., tem\u00ad perature device built into the wall of the container) are acceptable provided the tem\u00adperature measurement is accurate and such that there is no potential for contamination of the specimen. d. Must be individually wrapped in a sealed plastic bag or shrink wrapping; or must have a peelable, sealed lid or other easily visible tamper-evident system. e. May be made available separately at col\u00ad lection sites to address shy bladder situa\u00adtions when several voids may be required to complete the testing process. 2. Plastic Specimen Bottles a. Each bottle must be large enough to hold at least 35 mL; or alternatively, they may be two distinct sizes of specimen bottles provided that the bottle designed to hold the primary specimen holds at least 35 mL of urine and the bottle designed to hold the split specimen holds at least 20 mL. b. Must have screw-on or snap-on caps that prevent seepage of the urine from the bottles during shipment. c. Must have markings clearly indicating the appropriate levels (30 mL for the primary specimen and 15 mL for the split) of urine that must be poured into the bottles. d. Must be designed so that the required tamper-evident bottle seals made available on the CCF fit with no damage to the seal when the employee initials it nor with the chance that the seal overlap would conceal printed information. Pt. 40, App. B e. Must be wrapped (with caps) together in a sealed plastic bag or shrink wrapping sepa\u00adrate from the collection container; or must be wrapped (with cap) individually in sealed plastic bags or shrink wrapping; or must have peelable, sealed lid or other easily visi\u00adble tamper-evident system. f. Plastic material must be leach resistant. 3. Leak-Resistant Plastic Bag a. Must have two sealable compartments or pouches which are leak-resistant; one large enough to hold two specimen bottles and the other large enough to hold the CCF paperwork. b. The sealing methodology must be such that once the compartments are sealed, any tampering or attempts to open either com\u00adpartment will be evident. 4. Absorbent material Each kit must contain enough absorbent material to absorb the entire contents of both specimen bottles. Absorbent material must be designed to fit inside the leak-re\u00ad sistant plastic bag pouch into which the specimen bottles are placed. 5. Shipping Container a. Must be designed to adequately protect the specimen bottles from shipment damage in the transport of specimens from the col\u00adlection site to the laboratory (e.g., standard courier box, small cardboard box, plastic container). b. May be made available separately at col\u00ad lection sites rather than being part of an ac\u00adtual kit sent to collection sites. c. A shipping container is not necessary if a laboratory courier hand-delivers the speci\u00admen bottles in the plastic leak-proof bags from the collection site to the laboratory.

Experience: Minimum requirements are for three years of full-time supervised expe\u00ad rience or 6,000 hours of supervised experience as an alcoholism and/or drug abuse coun\u00adselor. The supervision must be provided by a licensed or certified practitioner. Supervised experience is important if the individual is to be considered a professional in the field of alcohol and drug abuse evaluation and coun\u00adseling. 2. Education: There exists a requirement of 270 contact hours of education and training in alcoholism and/or drug abuse or related training. These hours can take the form of formal education, in-service training, and professional development courses. Part of any professional counselor's development is participation in formal and non-formal edu\u00adcation opportunities within the field. 3. Continuing Education: The certified coun\u00ad selor must receive at least 40-60 hours of continuing education units (CEU) during each two year period. These CEUs are impor\u00adtant to the counselor's keeping abreast of changes and improvements in the field. 4. Testing: A passing score on a national test is a requirement. The test must accu\u00ad rately measure the application of the knowl\u00adedge, skills, and abilities possessed by the counselor. The test establishes a national standard that must be met to practice. 5. Testing Validity: The certification exam\u00ad ination must be reviewed by an independent authority for validity (examination reli\u00adability and relationship to the knowledge, skills, and abilities required by the coun\u00ad seling field). The reliability of the exam is paramount if counselor attributes are to be accurately measured. The examination pass\u00ading score point must be placed at an appro\u00adpriate minimal level score as gauged by sta\u00adtistically reliable methodology. 6. Measurable Knowledge Base: The certifi\u00ad cation process must be based upon measur\u00adable knowledge possessed by the applicant and verified through collateral data and test\u00ading. That level of knowledge must be of suffi\u00ad cient quantity to ensure a high quality of SAP evaluation and referral services. 7. Measurable Skills Base: The certification process must be based upon measurable skills possessed by the applicant and verified through collateral data and testing. That level of skills must be of sufficient quality to ensure a high quality of SAP evaluation and referral services. 8. Quality Assurance Plan: The certification agency must ensure that a means exists to determine that applicant records are verified as being true by the certification staff. This is an important check to ensure that true in- formation is being accepted by the certifying agency. 666 Office of the Secretary of Transportation 9. Code of Ethics: Certified counselors must pledge to adhere to an ethical standard for practice. It must be understood that code violations could result in de-certification. These standards are vital in maintaining the integrity of practitioners. High ethical standards are required to ensure quality of client care and confidentiality of client in-formation as well as to guard against inap\u00adpropriate referral practices. 10. Re-certification Program: Certification is not just a one-time event. It is a continuing privilege with continuing requirements. Among these are continuing education, con\u00adtinuing state certification, and concomitant adherence to the code of ethics. Re-certifi\u00ad cation serves as a protector of client inter\u00adests by removing poor performers from the certified practice. 11. Fifty State Coverage: Certification must be available to qualified counselors in all 50 states and, therefore, the test must be avail-able to qualified applicants in all 50 states. Because many companies are multi-state op\u00ad erators, consistency in SAP evaluation qual\u00ad ity and opportunities is paramount. The test need not be given in all 50 states but should be accessible to candidates from all states. 12. National Commission for Certifying Agen\u00ad cies (NCCA) Accreditation: Having NCCA ac\u00adcreditation is a means of demonstrating to the Department of Transportation that your certification has been reviewed by a panel of impartial experts that have determined that your examination(s) has met stringent and appropriate testing standards. APPENDIX F TO PART 40\u2014D RUG AND AL\u00ad COHOL TESTING INFORMATION THAT C/TPA S MAY TRANSMIT TO EMPLOY \u00ad ERS 1. If you are a C/TPA, you may, acting as an intermediary, transmit the information in the following sections of this part to the DER for an employer, if the employer choos\u00ades to have you do so. These are the only items that you are permitted to transmit to the employer as an intermediary. The use of C/TPA intermediaries is prohibited in all other cases, such as transmission of labora\u00adtory drug test results to MROs, the trans- mission of medical information from MROs to employers, the transmission of SAP re-ports to employers, the transmission of posi\u00ad tive alcohol test results, and the trans- mission of medical information from MROs to employers. 2.

SUMMARY : The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has combined its drug and alcohol testing regulations. This final rule incorporates guidance that FTA has issued in the past several years in letters of interpretation, audit findings, newsletters, training classes, safety seminars, and public speaking engagements. In addition, this final rule conforms FTA's rule to the Department of Transportation's (DOT) revised drug and alcohol testing rule published on December 19, 2000.

Regulatory Information On April 30, 2001, FTA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing changes to conform its drug and alcohol testing regulation (49 CFR Part 655) to the December 19, 2000 revision of DOT's transportation workplace testing procedures at 49 CFR Part 40. (66 FR 21551). While several of the amendments to Part 40 became effective on January 18, 2001, the entire revised Part 40 will become effective on August 1, 2001. Generally, final rules must be published at least 30 days before their effective dates. However, the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. sec. 553(d)(3)) creates an exception to this general rule on the basis of good cause found by the agency. FTA is making this conforming rule effective immediately upon publication, rather than 30 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register to ensure that FTA's drug and alcohol testing regulation is consistent with the Department's Part 40 testing procedures, 3 which are effective on August 1, 2001. This consistency is necessary in order to avoid overlap, conflict, duplication, or confusion among DOT drug and alcohol testing regulations. Unless this rule goes into effect immediately, there would be a 30-day period in which Part 40 would be in effect without FTA's conforming amended final rule. Since the new Part 40 was published over seven months ago, affected parties have had ample time to prepare to implement the changes in Part 40 to which this rule conforms. I. Background The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (the Act) mandated the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations to combat prohibited drug use and alcohol misuse in the transportation industry. (Public Law 102-143, October 28, 1991, FTA sections codified at 49 U.S.C. 5331). In December 1992, FTA issued two NPRMs to prevent prohibited drug use and alcohol misuse by \"safety-sensitive\" employees in the transit industry. In February 1994, FTA adopted drug and alcohol testing rules, which were promulgated at 49 CFR Parts 653 and 654. Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 The Act requires FTA to issue regulations requiring recipients of Federal transit funds under 49 U.S.C. 5307, 5309, and 5311, and 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(4) to test safety-sensitive employees for the use of alcohol or drugs in violation of law or federal regulation. With respect to railroad operations, the Act allows FTA to defer to regulations issued by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). As a condition of FTA funding, the Act requires recipients to establish alcohol and drug testing programs. The Act mandates four types of testing: pre-employment, random, reasonable suspicion, and post-accident. In addition, the Act permits return-to- 4 duty and follow-up testing under specific circumstances. The Act requires that recipients follow the testing procedures set out by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The Act does not require recipients to follow a particular course of action when they learn that a safety-sensitive employee has violated a law or Federal regulation concerning alcohol or drug use. Rather, the Act directs FTA to issue regulations establishing consequences for the use of alcohol or prohibited drugs by individuals performing safety-sensitive functions in the transit industry. Possible consequences include education, counseling, rehabilitation programs, and suspension or termination from employment. In authorizing this regulatory scheme, the Act has pre-empted inconsistent State or local laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, st andards, or orders. However, provisions of State criminal law, which impose sanctions for reckless conduct leading to actual loss of life, injury, or damage to property, are not pre-empted by the Act. Previous Action by FTA On December 15, 1992, FTA issued two notices of proposed rule making to prevent prohibited drug use and alcohol misuse (49 CFR Parts 653 and 654). (57 FR 59646 and 57 FR 59660). The rules established a process whereby safety-sensitive employees would be tested on a pre-employment, random, reasonable suspicion, post- accident, return-to-duty, and follow-up basis. In the December 1992 Federal Register notice, FTA stated that it was \"considering combining the final FTA alcohol and drug testing regulations into one part 5 in the Code of Federal Regulations.\" At that time, FTA noted that while the drug and alcohol testing rules shared many similarities, there were still enough differences to warrant two distinct CFR Parts. On February 15, 1994, FTA adopted two separate rules: the drug testing rule, 49 CFR Part 653, and the alcohol testing rule, 49 CFR Part 654. (59 FR 7549 and 59 FR 7572). Since the rules were first published, there have been two notable amendments as well as several minor (technical) amendments. In December 1998, FTA amended its post-accident regulation to allow an employer to seek post-accident test results from law enforcement agencies where the employer has been unable to timely perform such a test. (63 FR 67612). FTA has stressed the limited applicability of this amendment. In January 1999, FTA amended its definition of \"[m]aintaining a revenue service vehicle or equipment,\" located under safety-sensitive function (\u00a7653.7 and \u00a7654.7). (64 FR 425). The amended definition included covered employees of both recipients and contractors performing overhaul and rebuilding serv ices of engines, parts, and vehicles. Previously, employees of contractors who were performing safety-sensitive functions did not have to comply with FTA drug and alcohol testing. In issuing the amended definition, FTA noted that it would be unduly burdensome to subject the covered employees of contractors to the drug and alcohol regulations if the overhaul/rebuilding work was done on an ad hoc or one-time basis where no long-term contract between the grantee and its contract or existed. (64 FR 426). FTA will continue to exclude the covered employees of contactors who perform safety-sensitive functions on an ad hoc or one-time basis. 6 When the drug and alcohol rules initially became effective, FTA began an aggressive outreach effort to assist affected entities in complying with the new rules. FTA offered numerous courses throughout the country on implementation. Additionally, in April 1994, FTA published Implementation Guidelines for Drug and Alcohol Regulations in Mass Transit and made them available to anyone seeking help implementing the rules. The guidelines were published in the Federal Register several months prior to the effective date of the rules. They provided step-by-step instructions on how to most effectively comply with Parts 653 and 654. FTA will issue updated guidelines to assist with the implementation of Part 655. Additionally, FTA has issued numerous letters of interpretation on the rules. Public response to these letters, especially since they became available on FTA's external Web page, has been highly favorable. Employers and employees found that the letters were very helpful in explaining the rules. FTA will continue to offer interpretive guidance with respect to Part 655. To determine compliance with the rules, FTA's Office of Safety and Security began auditing grantee drug and alcohol testing programs in March 1997. The audits quickly evolved into opportunities for FTA to provide extensive technical assistance. Through the audits, FTA has gained a better understanding of the difficulties that grantees encounter when implementing the rules. In addition, audits have shown FTA where the rules can be strengthened and improved. The impetus to combine Parts 653 and 654 is 7 due, in no small part, to the audit program. II. Overview of Rule This rule combines the drug and alcohol testing rules, found at 49 CFR Parts 653 and 654, and conforms these rules to the Department's drug and alcohol testing procedures at 49 CFR Part 40. FTA believes this change will allow the program to be implemented more efficiently and will bring FTA into line with the other operating administrations that fall under the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991, (Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration), as well as the two other operating administrations that have drug and alcohol testing regulations (Research and Special Programs Administration and U.S. Coast Guard). The rule applies to direct and indirect recipients of funds under 49 U.S.C. 5307, 5309, 5311, and 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(4). It requires transit operators (employers) who receive these funds to establish and conduct a multifaceted anti-drug and alcohol misuse testing program. The regulation conditions financial assistance on the implementation of a program. Failure of an employer to develop and implement a program in compliance with this regulation may result in the suspension of Federal transit funding. The regulation requires the testing of safety-sensitive employees for the use of controlled substances and the misuse of alcohol; however the regulation also requires education and awareness about the problems associated with prohibited drug use and alcohol misuse. In addition, the regulation mandates that each employer have a policy statement describing its program policies and procedures. The statement must include 8 the consequences for prohibited drug use and alcohol misuse. The regulation specifies that safety-sensitive employees are prohibited from using five illegal substances (marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine). Safety-sensitive employees are also prohibited from misusing alcohol. The rule requires testing of safety-sensitive employees in five situations: (1) Pre-employment (including transfer to a safety-sensitive position within the organization; (2) Reasonable suspicion; (3) Random; (4) Post-accident; and (5) Return-to-duty/follow-up (periodic). Drug testing is required in all five situations. Alcohol testing is required for all situations except for pre-employment. The rule requires the use of the Department-wide drug and alcohol testing procedures contained in 49 CFR Part 40. If a covered employee tests positive for illegal drug use or alcohol misuse or otherwise violates the rule, the employee must be removed from his or her safety-sensitive position. The employee must then be informed about education and rehabilitation programs. Should the employer decide to retain a covered employee whose test result has been verified positive, the employee must be evaluated by a substance abuse professional. Prior to returning an employee to a safety-sensitive function, the employer must ensure that the employee has successfully completed rehabilitation; the rule does not require the employer to pay for rehabilitation. Any action on the part of FTA for noncompliance is against recipients of Federal transit funds, i.e., transit systems, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), states, and third party contractors that perform safety-sensitive functions. MPOs and states are affected by this regulation if they receive Federal transit funds and (1) they provide 9 transit service or they provide funding to a s ubrecipient. MPOs or states that fund or manage transit providers, but do not provide transit service, must ensure that transit provider employers provide a certification of compliance. FTA's relationship is with its grantees. Many grantees that receive transit funds operate mass transit services. Typical among these are large transit entities that receive funds under sections 49 U.S.C. 5307, 5309, and 5311. In addition, some grantees (typically states) pass Federal transit funds to smaller subrecipients within the state. This rule eliminates the distinction between large and small operators. The term \"employer\" is now used to include both small and large operators, as well as entities providing service under contract or other arrangement with the transit operator. III. Section-by-Section Discussion of the Comments In this section, FTA will discuss the differences between the rules in Parts 653 and 654 and the final rule in Part 655. The responses to comments on each section are also included herein. There is no discussion for sections that have remained substantially the same. FTA also did not discuss comment s that addressed Department-wide issues, which are more properly addressed in Part 40, or issues that were beyond the scope of the NPRM. FTA received 84 comments in response to the NPRM. The breakdown among commenter categories follows: Nonprofits, and special transit providers: 10 City and County transit providers: 19 State agencies: 20 10 Labor unions: 3 Trade associations: 9 Individual citizens: 12 Private businesses: 11. FTA considered all comments filed in a timely manner, as well as all statements and material presented at the public meetings on the NPRM. Subpart A--General A. Definitions . (\u00a7655.4) Employer : In the NPRM, FTA proposed that, in addition to direct recipients of FTA funding, the term \"employer\" include state recipients that pass the money to subrecipients and grantees that have contractors performing transit operations. The definition change was proposed to provide states and grantees access to covered employees' drug and alcohol test records in order to certify compliance with FTA drug and alcohol testing rules by subrecipients and contractors. FTA received a significant number of comments regarding the designation of states as employers. Several states were concerned that being named an employer in order to access drug and alcohol records would have legal and technical implications that may expose the state to potential litigation. States were also concerned that they may become the warehouse of records and be responsible for responding to potential employers requesting information that is required under 49 CFR 40.25. Grantees that utilize contractors to provide transit services offered similar concerns. Regardless, a significant number of commenters acknowledged the necessity of having access to test 11 results of covered employees since Subpart I requires recipients to certify that their contractors and/or subrecipients are complying with the drug and alcohol testing program. Numerous commenters stated that this objective could be accomplished by amending 49 CFR 655.73 - Access to Facilities and Records. FTA Response . FTA agrees with the commenters and has remedied this situation with the addition of paragraph 49 CFR 655.73 (i). An employer may disclose drug and alcohol testing information required to be maintained under this part only to the state oversight agency or grantee required to certify to FTA compliance with the drug and alcohol testing procedures at 49 CFR Parts 40 and 655. Although several commenters indicated that law enforcement agencies should have access to records maintained under this part upon request, FTA recognizes that individual privacy rights require limited dissemination of this information. This section does not authorize release of information maintained under this part to a law enforcement agency based solely on the request of the law enforcement agency. Second chance policy : FTA proposed adding this definition to the rule with the understanding that grantees have the discretion to adopt a second chance policy, i.e., a policy allowing an employee (who has previously violated the Federal drug and/or alcohol regulations) to return to a safety-sensitive position after completing rehabilitation. FTA received a limited number of comments on this subject. A few commenters expressed appreciation for the definition while most questioned the necessity for its inclusion since it is the employer's discretion to implement a \"second chance policy\". 12 FTA Response . FTA opts not to include \"second chance policy\" under definitions at this time. Since the decision to retain a covered employee is within the discretion of the employer, the phrase will not be defined in the final rule. Taxi cab drivers and other transportation providers : FTA requested comments regarding its guidance and policy relating to this category of contractors. According to FTA policy, drug and alcohol testing rules do not apply to taxi cab drivers when patrons (using publicly subsidized vouchers) or transportation providers can choose from a variety of taxicab operators. A number of commenters on this subject expressed concern that many rural and small urban communities have limited availability of taxi service. One commenter questioned FTA's regulatory authority to include taxi operators under the drug and alcohol testing rule. Other commenters indicated that a taxi operator is performing a safety-sensitive function whether the patron or the provider selects the taxi service and should be subject to the rule. FTA Response . The intent of FTA's regulatory scheme is not to impose Federal regulations on the taxi industry; however, taxi companies that contract with transportation service providers receiving Federal transit funds are subject to compliance with the drug and alcohol rules. FTA policy continues to recognize the practical difficulty of administering a drug and alcohol testing program to taxi companies that only incidentally provide transit service. Therefore, the drug and alcohol testing rules apply when the transit provider enters into a contract with one or more entities to provide taxi service. The rules do not apply when the patron (using subsidized vouchers) selects the 13 taxi company that provides the transit service. This guidance reflects the FTA Master Agreement, which requires recipients to include appropriate clauses in third party contracts requiring contractors to comply with applicable Federal requirements. It also recognizes the practical difficulty of administering a drug and alcohol testing program to entities that only incidentally provide taxi service on behalf of a transportation service provider. Dispatchers . FTA requested comments on the duties and responsibilities of dispatchers in the different transit systems. The objective was to determine whether the duties and responsibilities vary significantly enough to warrant modification of the current rule. A significant number of commenters indicated that bus dispatchers whose duties are of an administrative nature and primarily communicate directions to a bus operator do not perform a safety-sensitive function. Other commenters indicated that their dispatchers did indeed perform safety-sensitive functions, including but not limited to responding to emergency situations and should remain subject to the rules. The majority of the commenters in rural and small urban areas indicated that their dispatchers did not perform safety-sensitive functions. FTA Response . The comments confirm that bus dispatchers perform a myriad of duties depending on the employer. FTA's rules apply to anyone who performs a safety-sensitive function, which includes the control of the \"dispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle.\" 14 Since each employer uses its own terminology to describe job categories that involve safety-sensitive functions, each employer must continue to decide whether a particular employee performs any of the functions listed in the definition of \"safety- sensitive function,\" including bus dispatchers. As noted in previous guidance, the key consideration remains the type of work performed rather than any particular job title. Based on the comments received, FTA will not attempt a universal definition of \"dispatchers\" at this time. Instead, FTA will allow each employer to determine whether a particular dispatcher performs or may perform a safety-sensitive function. Maintenance contractors . In the NPRM, FTA reiterated that maintenance contractors that perform safety-sensitive functions are subject to the drug and alcohol testing rules, for the reasons noted in the preamble to the 1999 rule change, i.e., fairness and safety (64 FR 425, January 5, 1999). Most comments on this subject concerned the difficulty employers have in requiring maintenance contractors to implement a drug and alcohol program. Much of the discussion related to the difficulty in finding maintenance contractors willing to comply with the drug and alcohol testing requirements, particularly where the maintenance contractor provides service on an occasional basis. A number of commenters offered that maintenance shops cannot afford to implement an ongoing program for the amount of transit-related business generated. As a result, this would severely restrict the grantee/subrecipient's ability to properly maintain FTA-funded vehicles. The majority of comments urged the FTA to completely exempt maintenance contractors from the drug and alcohol testing regulations. Several urban grantees commented on the fact that the type of work they are 15 contracting out is often performed by small shops focusing on a very narrow repair area. These maintenance contractors have limited administrative staff, which causes them difficulty in administering a drug and alcohol program. FTA Response . FTA recognizes these concerns, but also recognizes the public safety interest inherent in testing safety-sensitive employees. FTA has developed a middle ground to alleviate some of the problems associated with this issue. FTA still recognizes that recipients funded with 49 U.S.C. 5311 funds and which contract out maintenance service are excluded from the drug and alcohol testing rules. In addition, recipients of Federal transit funds under 49 U.S.C. 5307 and 5309 in an area less than 200,000 in population and which contract out such services are no longer required to comply with Part 655. Also, maintenance providers of safety-sensitive functions for a grantee on an ad hoc or one-time basis are not required to comply. Volunteers . FTA proposed to clarify when volunteers are covered employees subject to the drug and alcohol testing rules. Most commenters indicated that the proposed language needed further clarification. FTA Response . FTA has reviewed the proposed language and amends the definition of covered employee by deleting re ference to the volunteers' \"expectation of in-kind or tangible benefits.\" Instead, a volunteer is deemed a covered employee when he or she receives remuneration in excess of their actual personal expenses incurred while performing the volunteer service. B. Stand-down Waivers for Drug Testing (655.5) FTA proposed procedures on stand-down waiv ers to conform with 49 CFR Part 40. 16 Most of the commenters to this section expressed support. However, one commenter expressed opposition to the provision claiming that it undercuts the confidentiality principles inherent in the FTA's drug and alcohol testing program. Another commenter indicated that FTA should provide additional criteria not identified in 49 CFR Part 40. FTA Response . FTA is aware of the confidentiality concerns and will carefully review each petition to determine if the facts and justification warrant a waiver. The requirements for obtaining a waiver are provided in 49 CFR 40.21. The proposed rule will be incorporated in the final rule to conform with 49 CFR Part 40. Subpart B\u2014Program Requirements A. Policy Statement Contents (\u00a7655.15) FTA proposed limiting information required in a Policy Statement to that listed in section 655.15. FTA also clarified who must approve the policy. In most instances, a grantee will have a governing board that can adopt the policy. However, where there is no governing board or the governing board does not have approval authority, the highest- ranking official with authority to approve the policy may do so. FTA also noted that employers may incorporate by reference 49 CFR Part 40 in their Policy Statements, provided it is available for review by employees when requested. Most commenters expressed support for the effort to simplify this requirement. However, one commenter noted that eliminating the requirement to address specific sections of 49 CFR Part 40 and making Part 40 available to the employee creates the potential for misunderstanding by the employee. Another commenter indicated that specific employee rights should be required in this section. A few commenters also 17 recommended that FTA impose schedules for when the employee and supervisor training requirement should occur and the frequency with which it should be scheduled. FTA Response . FTA believes that simplifying the contents required in the Policy Statement reduces the administrative burden while maintaining an employer's discretion to craft a Policy Statement that includes additional requirements not mandated by FTA. FTA also believes that it would be an undue burden to mandate an industry-wide training schedule. The final rule recognizes the diversity of employee-management relationships within the transit industry and also strikes a reasonable balance with the requirement for employee and supervisor training. However, a grantee may choose to include additional requirements not mandated by FTA, i.e., recurring training and employee rights. If a grantee does so, the grantee's policy shall indicate that those additional requirements are the employer's, and not FTA's. FTA also believes that it is reasonable for employers to incorporate by reference 49 CFR Part 40 in their Policy Statements and make it available for review by employees when requested. Subpart E - Types of Testing A. Pre-employment Drug Testing (\u00a7655.41) . FTA notified the public of the intent to eliminate the phrase \"hire\" in this provision of the rule. Previously, employers were required to administer a drug test and receive a negative result before hiring an employee. FTA also notified the public of its proposal to require a pre-employment test for covered employees who are away from work for more than 90 consecutive calendar days and plan to return to a safety-sensitive function. It is FTA's intent that employers assure 18 themselves that employees can successfully pass a drug test before returning them to safety-sensitive functions. The majority of commenters support the change in the provision that allows a covered employee to be hired prior to receiving a negative drug test result. These comments indicated that the rule balances the employer's personnel concerns with the public safety interest by ensuring that the new covered employee is not permitted to perform a safety-sensitive function for the first time until a negative drug test result is received. However, one commenter stated that the public safety interest is better served by prohibiting the hiring of a covered employee prior to receiving a drug test result. Another comment indicated that FTA should adopt pre-employment provisions similar to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). Many commenters supported clarification of the rule regarding the time required to elapse before an absent covered employee should take another pre-employment drug test. A majority of rural and small urban employers are in favor of this rule because they employ seasonal and temporary workers. A few comments indicated that there is no basis to retest a covered employee after a 90-day absence. However, one employer indicated that a pre-employment test should be administered after 90 days regardless of whether the employee was in the employer's random pool or not. Another commenter indicated that pre-employment testing should be administered following consecutive absences as short as 30 days. FTA Response . FTA has reviewed the comments and will incorporate the NPRM language into the final rule. FTA believes that deleting the phrase \"hire\" in this section 19 provides an employer with the discretion to administer a pre-employment drug test anytime before the employee first performs a safety-sensitive function. FTA also believes the 90-day period is reasonable. It gives the employer the discretion to decide whether or not the covered employee is retained in the random pool during his or her absence. If the employee is retained in the random pool, then pre-employment testing is not required. In determining whether to retain the employee in the random pool, one consideration is the likelihood of the employee's return to perform safety-sensitive functions. B. Pre-Employment Alcohol Testing (\u00a7655.42) . FTA noted in the NPRM that its pre-employment alcohol testing requirements were suspended due to a court decision and subsequent legislation. Most commenters indicated that FTA's new rule should also omit the pre-employment alcohol testing provisions, primarily because alcohol consumption is a legal activity. Others indicated that since pre-employment testing would not be conducted under FTA authority, this section should not be included in the final rule. FTA Response . The NPRM language is included in the final rule to conform with the other DOT agency drug and alcohol testing programs. All six DOT agencies with testing programs are adding this section to their respective rules. This section allows, but does not require, employers to conduct pre-employment alcohol testing. If an employer chooses to conduct pre-employment alcohol testing, the employer must conduct the testing in accordance with all of the requirements of 49 CFR Part 40. C. Reasonable Suspicion Testing (\u00a7 655.43) 20 Several commenters responding to this section indicated that FTA should not interfere with an employer's ability to require two or more trained supervisors to participate and/or agree on referring an employee for reasonable suspicion testing. One commenter indicated that employers should be allowed to authorize other personnel to make reasonable suspicion testing observations similar to the FMCSA. Two commenters indicated that this testing requirement should not be required at all because the consumption of alcohol is legal. Other commenters indicated that provisions found in 49 CFR 654.37(c) and (d) should be incorporated in the final rule. FTA Response . FTA believes that the public safety interest is furthered with the inclusion of this requirement and the final rule is amended to include the language of 49 CFR 654.37(c) and (d). FTA also notes that the proposed bar to an employer requiring two or more trained supervisors to make such referrals is not included in the final rule. FTA also agrees that an employer should be permitted to authorize and train other company officers to make reasonable suspicion observations; therefore this section and section 655.14 of subpart B are amended accordingly. D. Post-Accident Testing (\u00a7 655.44) . FTA noted in the NPRM that its post-accident testing regulation was previously amended to allow an employer, in extremely limited circumstances, to use the post-accident test results administered by local law enforcement only when the employer is unable to perform a post-accident test within the required time frame. Of the few comments received on this section, most indicated support for the limited exception to use post-accident test results from local law enforcement. However, 21 a commenter indicated that the rule does not state that this provision is to be used in limited circumstances. Another commenter stated that the employer should not be permitted to use post-accident test results administered by local law enforcement because the standards for these tests may be less than those imposed by DOT. One commenter stated that FTA should not require post-accident testing when it is also required by FMCSA. FTA Response . FTA noted that the proposed rule did not state the limited exception under which an employer may use the test results of a law enforcement agency. The final rule is amended to indicate that an employer may use the post-accident test results of a law enforcement agency when the employer is unable to test within the required time frame established by FTA and the test is performed to the applicable standards of the entity authorized to administer the drug or alcohol test. FTA and FMCSA are amending their respective post-accident testing rule to eliminate the requirement for duplicative post-accident testing of operators. E. Random Testing (\u00a7 655.45) FTA reiterated in the NPRM that a primary purpose of random testing is deterrence. Deterrence is most effectively achieved with random, unpredictable drug and alcohol testing that is conducted throughout all workdays and hours of service. Although the majority of commenters supported the concept of random drug testing, a significant number indicated that employers in rural areas have an increased burden complying with this provision. They have difficulty in obtaining testing services after normal business hours within their areas and/or because of distances between testing 22 service providers and the employer. Four commenters also noted that the NPRM incorrectly stated the current random alcohol testing rate. FTA Response . The proposed language is incorporated in the final rule with some modification. The concern reflected by employers in rural areas is noted; however, FTA believes that the public safety interest is promoted with random testing that is truly random and unpredictable. However, FTA believes that requiring random testing to be conducted at least quarterly strikes a reasonable balance while considering the rule's impact on employers in rural areas. Additionally, FTA is reviewing the recommendation to allow individual rural transit systems to apply to have its random testing rate based on its individual performance and program instead of industry-wide data. Paragraph (a) of this section is amended to read 10% instead of 25%. Paragraph (i) of this section is also amended to reflect that random testing for alcohol misuse is subject to safety-sensitive performance limitations while testing for drug use is permitted anytime during the workday. Subpart H - Administrative Requirements A. Retention of Records (\u00a7655.71) and Reporting Results In A Management Information System (\u00a7655.72) The NPRM proposed changing FTA's Management Information System (MIS) reporting requirement from census reporting to stratified random sampling because it now has an accurate portrait of the current state of drug and alcohol testing (including positive rates) in the transit industry. Most commenters indicated that FTA's intent to reduce the paperwork requirement is better achieved by using technology (e.g., web 23 based/electronic submission). A few comment ers stated that the proposed rule does not reduce their administrative burden. Most commenters indicated that sampling reduces some of the burden on rural transit systems; however, a commenter noted that states are still required to collect subrecipient's data. Other commenters indicated that FTA should have one uniform period for record retention. FTA Response . FTA believes sampling will reduce the paperwork burden on a portion of the industry while still maintaining a high confidence level in the results. Transit employers are still required to prepare an MIS form annually; however, they will only be required to submit an MIS form when requested by FTA. However, FTA's record retention time periods reflect those of the other DOT modes for administrative uniformity. FTA will review the feasibility of web-based submission of data and will issue further guidance on this issue. B. Access to Facilities And Records (\u00a7655.73) As previously discussed in section 655.4 of subpart A, FTA received a number of comments indicating that states should not be included under the definition of \"employer\" in order to gain access to records. Many commenters also objected to state regulatory agencies and law enforcement agencies having independent access to employee records. The majority of comments indicated that only those state agencies and grantees with oversight responsibilities and which are required to certify compliance should have access to the employee's drug and alcohol testing information. FTA Response . The final rule is amended by adding paragraph (i) to this section. An employer may release information to the state agency or grantee with oversight 24 responsibility of FTA transit funds which is required to certify compliance under this part. IV. Effect of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 on Alcohol Testing Programs Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) focuses on employers' responsibilities toward employees with disabilities. According to Title I, an employer must provide reasonable accommodations for work for persons with disabilities. Some covered workers are considered persons with disabilities for purposes of protection under the ADA. This issue was treated more fully in the 1994 DOT-wide preamble (59 FR 7302, 7311-14, February 15, 1994). V. Regulatory Process Matters A. Executive Order 12866 FTA has evaluated the industry costs and benefits of this rule, which require that transit industry personnel who perform safety-sensitive functions be covered by a program to control illegal drug abuse and alcohol misuse in mass transportation operations. This rule makes no noteworthy substantive changes. Any incremental costs are negligible, and the policy and economic impact will have no significant effect. B. Departmental Significance This rule is a \"non-significant regulation\" as defined by the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures because, while it involves an important Departmental policy that is likely to generate a great deal of public interest, in the larger scheme, it is simply a combination of two existing regulations (49 CFR Parts 653 and 25 654). It also conforms FTA's drug and alcohol testing regulations with the Department's drug and alcohol testing regul ations (49 CFR Part 40), to which FTA grantees already are subject. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), FTA has made a preliminary assessment of the possible effects of the rule on small businesses. To the extent possible, FTA has made efforts to acknowledge the differences between small and large entities, and has endeavored to make accommodations when possible. Experience with Parts 653 and 654 has shown that the rule has had a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. FTA believes that this new rule will provide greater clarity and ease of implementation for small entities. D. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule includes information collection requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PWRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501, et. seq.) The Office of Management and Budget has approved FTA's PWRA request for Parts 653 and 654. This rule includes the same information collection devices; therefore, FTA believes it already has OMB approval. The Management Information System (MIS) forms currently required by Parts 653 and 654 may be modified in the future, but will continue to be required by FTA, without changes, under Part 655. E. Executive Order 13132 This action has been reviewed under Executive Order 13132 on Federalism. FTA has determined that this action has significant Federalism implications to warrant a 26 Federalism assessment. However, FTA has limited discretion because this rulemaking is mandated by Congress in the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991. The 1991 legislation mandated FTA to issue regulations requiring grantees of funds under 49 U.S.C. 5307, 5309, and 5311, and 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(4) to test their safety-sensitive employees for the use of drugs and the misuse of alcohol in violation of law or Federal regulation. Before passage of the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991, safety issues were largely handled as a local matter. This Act clarifies the Federal role by including specific Federal pre-emption language. This Act also makes it clear that, in the area of substance abuse testing, Federal regulations are to take precedence over any inconsistent State or local specifications. Although Congress has pre-empted State or local law, FTA has preserved the role of local entities in mass transit safety. This regulation does not disturb testing programs which were created by virtue of a grantee's own authority and which are not inconsistent with this regulation. F. Other Executive Orders . There are a number of other Executive Orders that can affect rulemakings. These include Executive Orders 13084 (Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments), 12988 (Civil Justice Reform), 12875 (Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership), 12630 (Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights), 12898 (Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations), 13045 (Protection of Children from 27 Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks), and 12889 (Implementation of North American Free Trade Agreement). We have considered these Executive Orders in the content of this rule, and we believe that the rule does not directly affect the matters covered by the Executive Orders.

(b) Each employer shall prohibit a covered employee, while having an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater, from performing or continuing to perform a safety-sensitive function. \u00a7655.32 On duty use. Each employer shall prohibit a covered employee from using alcohol while performing safety-sensitive functions. No employer having actual knowledge that a covered employee is using alcohol while performing safety-sensitive functions shall permit the employee to perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions. \u00a7655.33 Pre-duty use. (a) General . Each employer shall prohibit a covered employee from using alcohol within 4 hours prior to performing safety-sensitive functions. No employer having actual knowledge that a covered employee has used alcohol within four hours of performing a safety-sensitive function shall permit the employee to perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions. 43 (b) On-call employees . An employer shall prohibit the consumption of alcohol for the specified on-call hours of each covered employee who is on-call. The procedure shall include: (1) The opportunity for the covered employee to acknowledge the use of alcohol at the time he or she is called to report to duty and the inability to perform his or her safety-sensitive function. (2) The requirement that the covered employee take an alcohol test, if the covered employee has acknowledged the use of alcohol, but claims ability to perform his or her safety-sensitive function. \u00a7655.34 Use following an accident. Each employer shall prohibit alcohol use by any covered employee required to take a post-accident alcohol test under \u00a7655.44 of subpart E for eight hours following the accident or until he or she undergoes a post-accident alcohol test, whichever occurs first. \u00a7655.35 Other alcohol-related conduct. (a) No employer shall permit a covered employee tested under the provisions of subpart E of this part who is found to have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 to perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions, until: (1) The employee's alcohol concentration measures less than 0.02; or (2) The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than eight hours following administration of the test. (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, no employer shall take any action under this part against an employee based solely on test results showing an alcohol 44 concentration less than 0.04. This does not prohibit an employer with authority independent of this part from taking any action otherwise consistent with law. Subpart E - Types of Testing \u00a7655.41 Pre-employment drug testing (a) (1) Before allowing a covered employee or applicant to perform a safety-sensitive function for the first time, the employer must ensure that the employee takes a pre-employment drug test administered under this part with a verified negative result. An employer may not allow a covered employee, including an applicant, to perform a safety- sensitive function unless the employee takes a drug test administered under this part with a verified negative result. (2) When a covered employee or applicant has previously failed or refused a pre- employment drug test administered under this part, the employee must provide the employer proof of having successfully completed a referral, evaluation and treatment plan as described in section 655.62 of subpart G. (b) An employer may not transfer an employee from a nonsafety-sensitive function to a safety-sensitive function until the employee takes a pre-employment drug test administered under this part with a verified negative result. (c) If a pre-employment drug test is canceled, the employer shall require the covered employee or applicant to take another pre-employment drug test administered under this part with a verified negative result. (d) When a covered employee or applicant has not performed a safety-sensitive function for 90 consecutive calendar days regardless of the reason, and the employee has 45 not been in the employer's random selection pool during that time, the employer shall ensure that the employee takes a pre-employment drug test with a verified negative result. \u00a7655.42 Pre-employment alcohol testing. An employer may, but is not required to, conduct pre-employment alcohol testing under this part. If an employer chooses to conduct pre-employment alcohol testing, the employer must comply with the following requirements: (a) The employer must conduct a pre-employment alcohol test before the first performance of safety-sensitive functions by every covered employee (whether a new employee or someone who has transferred to a position involving the performance of safety-sensitive functions). (b) The employer must treat all covered employees performing safety-sensitive functions the same for the purpose of pre-employment alcohol testing (i.e., you must not test some covered employees and not others). (c) The employer must conduct the pre-employment tests after making a contingent offer of employment or transfer, subject to the employee passing the pre-employment alcohol test. (d) The employer must conduct all pre-employment alcohol tests using the alcohol testing procedures set forth in 49 CFR Part 40. (e) The employer must not allow a covered employee to begin performing safety-sensitive functions unless the result of the employee's test indicates an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02. 46 \u00a7655.43 Reasonable suspicion testing. (a) An employer shall conduct a drug and/or alcohol test when the employer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the covered employee has used a prohibited drug and/or engaged in alcohol misuse. (b) An employer's determination that reasonable suspicion exists shall be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the covered employee. A supervisor(s), or other company official(s) who is trained in detecting the signs and symptoms of drug use and alcohol misuse must make the required observations. (c) Alcohol testing is authorized under this section only if the observations required by paragraph (b) of this section are made during, just preceding, or just after the period of the workday that the covered employee is required to be in compliance with this part. An employer may direct a covered employee to undergo reasonable suspicion testing for alcohol only while the employee is performing safety-sensitive functions; just before the employee is to perform safety-sensitive functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing such functions. (d) If an alcohol test required by this section is not administered within two hours following the determination under paragraph (b) of this section, the employer shall prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the alcohol test was not promptly administered. If an alcohol test required by this section is not administered within eight hours following the determination under paragraph (b) of this section, the employer shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall state in the record 47 the reasons for not administering the test. \u00a7655.44 Post-accident testing. (a) Accidents. (1) Fatal accidents . (i) As soon as practicable following an accident involving the loss of human life, an employer shall conduct drug and alcohol tests on each surviving covered employee operating the mass transit vehicle at the time of the accident. Post-accident drug and alcohol testing of the operator is not required under this section if the covered employee is tested under the fatal accident testing requirements of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration rule 49 CFR 389.303(a)(1) or (b)(1). (ii) The employer shall also drug and alcohol test any other covered employee whose performance could have contributed to the accident, as determined by the employer using the best information available at the time of the decision. (2) Nonfatal accidents . (i) As soon as practicable following an accident not involving the loss of human life in which a mass transit vehicle is involved, the employer shall drug and alcohol test each covered employee operating the mass transit vehicle at the time of the accident unless the employer determines, using the best information available at the time of the decision, that the covered employee's performance can be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. The employer shall also drug and alcohol test any other covered employee whose performance could have contributed to the accident, as determined by the employer using the best information available at the time of the decision (ii) If an alcohol test required by this section is not administered within two hours following the accident, the employer shall prepare and maintain on file a record stating 48 the reasons the alcohol test was not promptly administered. If an alcohol test required by this section is not administered within eight hours following the accident, the employer shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and maintain the record. Records shall be submitted to FTA upon request of the Administrator. (b) An employer shall ensure that a covered employee required to be drug tested under this section is tested as soon as practicable but within 32 hours of the accident. (c) A covered employee who is subject to post-accident testing who fails to remain readily available for such testing, including notifying the employer or the employer representative of his or her location if he or she leaves the scene of the accident prior to submission to such test, may be deemed by the employer to have refused to submit to testing. (d) The decision not to administer a drug and/or alcohol test under this section shall be based on the employer's determination, using the best available information at the time of the determination that the employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident. Such a decision must be documented in detail, including the decision-making process used to reach the decision not to test. (e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention for the injured following an accident or to prohibit a covered employee from leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain necessary emergency medical care. (f) The results of a blood, urine, or breath test for the use of prohibited drugs or alcohol misuse, conducted by Federal, State, or local officials having independent 49 authority for the test, shall be considered to meet the requirements of this section provided such test conforms to the applicable Federal, State, or local testing requirements, and that the test results are obtained by the employer. Such test results may be used only when the employer is unable to perform a post-accident test within the required period noted in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section \u00a7655.45 Random testing. (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered employees; the random alcohol testing rate shall be 10 percent. As provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this rate is subject to annual review by the Administrator. (b) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug and alcohol testing is based, respectively, on the reported positive drug and alcohol violation rates for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn from the drug and alcohol Management Information System (MIS) reports required by this part. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator shall consider the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from employers, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry's verified positive results and violation rates. Each year, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the minimum annual percentage rates for random drug and alcohol testing of covered employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug and alcohol testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication. 50 (c) Rates for drug testing. (1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of section 655.72 of subpart H for the two preceding consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is less than 1.0 percent. (2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of section 655.72 of subpart H for the calendar year indicate that the reported positive rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug or random alcohol testing to 50 percent of all covered employees. (d) Rates for alcohol testing. (1) (i) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 25 percent or more, the Administrator may lower this rate to 10 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of section 655.72 of subpart H for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less than 0.5 percent. (ii) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of section 655.72 of subpart H for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less than 1.0 percent but equal to or greater than 0.5 percent. (2) (i) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 51 10 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of section 655.72 of subpart H for that calendar year indicate that the violation rate is equal to or greater than 0.5 percent, but less than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing to 25 percent of all covered employees. (ii) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 25 percent or less, and the data received under the reporting requirements of section 655.72 of subpart H for that calendar year indicate that the violation rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing to 50 percent of all covered employees. (e) The selection of employees for random drug and alcohol testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. (f) The employer shall randomly select a sufficient number of covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rates for random drug and alcohol testing determined by the Administrator. If the employer conducts random drug and alcohol testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be tested may be calculated for each individual employer or may be based on the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who are subject to random drug and alcohol testing at the same minimum 52 annual percentage rate under this part. (g) Each employer shall ensure that random drug and alcohol tests conducted under this part are unannounced and unpredictable, and that the dates for administering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year. Random testing must be conducted at all times of day when safety-sensitive functions are performed. (h) Each employer shall require that each covered employee who is notified of selection for random drug or random alcohol testing proceed to the test site immediately. If the employee is performing a safety-sens itive function at the time of the notification, the employer shall instead ensure that the employee ceases to perform the safety-sensitive function and proceeds to the testing site immediately. (i) A covered employee shall only be randomly tested for alcohol misuse while the employee is performing safety-sensitive functions; just before the employee is to perform safety-sensitive functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing such functions. A covered employee may be randomly tested for prohibited drug use anytime while on duty. (j) If a given covered employee is subject to random drug and alcohol testing under the testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same employer, the employee shall be subject to random drug and alcohol testing at the percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function. (k) If an employer is required to conduct random drug and alcohol testing under the drug and alcohol testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employer may-- 53 (1) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same required rate; or (2) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to which the employer is subject. \u00a7655.46 Return to duty testing following refusal to submit to a test, verified positive drug test result and/or breath alcohol test result of 0.04 or greater. Where a covered employee refuses to submit to a test, has a verified positive drug test result, and/or has a confirmed alcohol test result of 0.04 or greater, the employer, before returning the employee to duty to perform a safety-sensitive function, shall follow the procedures outlined in 49 CFR Part 40. \u00a7655.47 Follow-up testing after returning to duty . An employer shall conduct follow-up testing of each employee who returns to duty, as specified in 49 CFR Part 40, subpart O. \u00a7655.48 Retesting of covered employees with an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04. If an employer chooses to permit a covered employee to perform a safety-sensitive function within 8 hours of an alcohol test indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04, the employer shall retest the covered employee to ensure compliance with the provisions of section 655.35 of subpart D. The covered employee may not perform safety-sensitive functions unless the confirmation alcohol test result is less than 0.02. \u00a7655.49 Refusal to submit to a drug or alcohol test. 54 (a) Each employer shall require a covered employee to submit to a post-accident drug and alcohol test required under section 655.44 of this subpart, a random drug and alcohol test required under section 655.45 of this subpart, a reasonable suspicion drug and alcohol test required under section 655.43 of this subpart, or a follow-up drug and alcohol test required under section 655.47 of this subpart. No employer shall permit an employee who refuses to submit to such a test to perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions. (b) When an employee refuses to submit to a drug or alcohol test, the employer shall follow the procedures outlined in 49 CFR Part 40. \u00a7655.50 [Reserved] Subpart F - Drug and Alcohol Testing Procedures \u00a7655.51 Compliance with testing procedures requirements.

NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES COVERED BY THE USCG, requires that you identify the number of employees in each employee category. Section C is used to summarize the drug testing results for applicants and covered employees. There are six categories of testing to be completed. The first part of the table is where you enter the data on pre-employment testing. The following five parts are for entering drug testing data on ra ndom, post-accident, reasonable suspicion, return to duty and follow-up testing, respectively. Items nec essary to complete these tables include: 1) the number of specimens collected in each employee category; 2) the number of specimens tested which were verified negative and verified pos itive for any drug(s); and 3) individual counts of those s pecimens which were verified positive for each of the five drugs. Do not include results of quality control (QC) samples submitted to the testing laboratory in any of the tables. A sample table with detailed instructions is provided for the first part, PRE-EMPLOYMENT testing information. The format and explanations used for the sample apply to all six parts of the table in Section C. Information on actions taken with thos e persons testing positive is required at the end of both pages. Specific instructions for providing this latter in formation are given after the instructions for completing the table in Section C. Page 3 DRUG TESTING INFORMATION (Section C) requires information for drug testing by category of testing. All numbers entered into the pre-employment category section of the table should be separated into the category of employment for which the person was a pplying or transferring. The other categories are for employee testing and require information for employees in covered positions only. Each part of this table must be completed for each category of testing. These categories include: (1) random, (2) post-accident, (3) reasonable suspicion, (4) return to duty, and (5) follow-up testing. These numbers do not include refusals for testing. A sample section of the table with example numbers is presented on page iv. Three types of information are necessary to complete the left side of this table. The first blank column with the heading \"NUMBER OF SPECIMENS COLLECTED,\" requires a count for all collected specimens by employee category. The second blank column with the heading \"NUMBER OF SPECIMENS VERIFIED NEGATIVE,\" require a count for all completed tests by employee category that were verified negative by your Medical Review Officer (MRO). The third blank column with the heading \"NUMBER OF SPECIMENS VERIFIED POSITIVE FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE FIVE DRUGS,\" refers to the number of specimens provided by applicants or employees that were verified positive. \"Verified positive\" means the resu lts were verified by your MRO. The right hand portion of this table, with the heading \"NUMBER OF SPECIMENS VERIFIED POSITIVE FOR EACH TYPE OF DRUG,\" requires counts of positive tests for each of the fi ve drugs for which tests were done, i.e., marijuana (THC), cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP), opiates, and amphetamines. The number of specimens positive for each drug should be entered in the appropriate column for that drug type. A gain, \"verified positive\" refers to test results verified by your MRO. If an applicant or employee tested positive for more than one drug; for example, both marijuana and cocaine, that person' s positive results would be included once in each of the appropriate columns (marijuana and cocaine). Each column in the table should be added and the answer entered in the row marked : \"TOTAL\". A sample table is provided on page iv with example numbers. Page 3 Below the part of the table containing pre-employment testing information is a box with the heading \"Number of persons denied a position as a covered employee following a verified positive drug test\". This is simply a count of those persons who were not placed in a covered position because they tested positive for one or more drugs. SAMPLE APPLICANT TEST RESULTS TABLE The following example is for Section C, DRUG TESTING INFORMATION, which summarizes pre-employment testing results. The procedures detailed here also apply to the other categories of testing in Section C which require you to su mmarize testing results for employees. This example uses the categories \"Revenue Vehicle Operation\" and \"Armed Security Personnel\" to illustrate the procedures for completing the form. A Urine specimens were collected for 157 applicants for revenue service vehicle operation positions during the reporting year. This info rmation is entered in the first blank column of the table in the row mark ed \"Revenue Vehicle Operation\". B The Medical Review Officer (MRO) for the employer reported that 153 of those 157 specimens from applicants for revenue servic e vehicle operation positions were negative (i.e., no drugs were detected). Enter this information in the second blank column of the table in the row marked \"R evenue Vehicle Operations\". C The MRO for the employer reported that 4 of those 157 specimens from applicants for revenue service vehicle operation positions were positive (i.e., a drug or drugs were detected). Enter this information in the third blank column of the table in the row marked \"Revenue Vehicle Operation\". D With the 4 specimens that tested positive, the following drugs were detected: Specimen Drugs #1 Marijuana was detected in three (3) specimens, cocaine in one (1), and amphetamines in one (1). This information is entered in the columns on t he right hand side of the t able under each of these drugs. Two different drugs were detected in spec imen #3 (multi-drug) so an entry is made in both the marijuana and the cocaine column for this specimen. Information on multi-drug specimens must also be entered in Section D, OTHER DRUG TESTING/PROGRAM INFORMATION , on page 5 of the reporting form. Please note that the sample data collection fo rm also has information for armed security personnel on line two. The same procedures outlined for revenue service vehicle operation should be followed for entering the data on armed security personnel. With applicants for armed security personnel positions, 107 specimens were collected resulting in 105 verified negatives and 2 verified positives - 1 for marijuana and 1 for opiates. This information is entered in the row marked \"Armed Security Personnel\". E The last row, marked \"TOTAL\", requires you to add the numbers in each of the columns. With this example, 157 specimens from applic ants for revenue service vehicle operation positions were collected and 107 for applicants for armed security personnel positions. The total for that columns would be 264 (i.e., 157 + 107). The same procedure should be used for each column, i.e., add all the numbers in that column and place the answer in the last row. PRE-E MPLOYMENT NUMBER OF SPE CIMENS VER IFIED POS ITIVE EACH TY PE OF DRUG EMPLOY EE CATEGORY NUMBER OF SPECIMENS COLLECTED NUMBER OF SPECIMENS VERIFIED NEGATIVE NUMBER OF SPECIMENS VERIFIED POSIT IVE FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE FIVE DRUGS (THC) COCAI NE PHENCY- CLIDINE (PC) OPIATES AMPHET- AMINES REVENUE VEHICLE OPERATION 157 153 4 3 1 0 0 1 ARMED SECURI TY PERSONNEL 107 105 2 1 0 0 1 0 TOTAL 264 258 6 4 1 0 1 1 A B C D E Note that adding up the numbers for each ty pe of drug in a row (\"NUMBER OF SPECIMENS VERIFIED POSITIVE FOR EACH TYPE OF DRUG\") will not always match the number entered in the third column, \"NUMBER OF SPECIMENS VERIFIED POSITIVE FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE FIVE DRUGS\". The total for the numbers on the right hand side of the table may differ from the number of specimens testing positive since some specimens may contain more than one drug. Remember that the same procedures indicated above are to be used for completing all of the categories for testing in Section C. Page 4 Following the table that summarizes DRUG TESTING INFORMATION, you must provide counts of fatal and non-fatal accidents and fatalities which resulted in positive post-accident drug tests for any employee involved in the accident. This information should be available from the safety program manager or the drug program manager. Page 4 Also following the table that summarizes DRUG TESTING INFORMATION, you must provide a count of employees returned to duty during this reporting period who had a verified positive drug test or refused a drug test required under the FTA rule. This information should be available from the personnel office and/or drug program manager. Page 5 OTHER DRUG TESTING/PROGRAM INFORMATION (Section D) requires that you complete a table dealing with specimens positive for more than one drug, employees testing positive for both drugs and alcohol, and a table dealing with employees who refused to submit to a drug test. Page 5 SPECIMENS VERIFIED POSITIVE FOR MORE THAN ONE DRUG requires information on specimens that contained more than one drug. Indicate the EMPLOYEE CATEGORY and the NUMBER OF VERIFIED POSITIVES . Then specify the combination of drugs reported as positive by placing the number in the appropriate columns. For example, if marijuana and cocaine were detected in 3 revenue vehicle operator specimen s, then you would wr ite \"Revenue Vehicle Operation\" as the employee category, \"3\" as the number of verified positives, and \"3\" in the columns for \"Marijuana\" and \"Cocaine\". If marijuana and opiates were detected in 2 revenue vehicle operator specimens, then you would write \"Revenue Vehicle Operation\" as the employee category, \"2\" as the number of verified positives, and \"2\" in the columns for \"Marijuana\" and \"Opiates\". Page 5 Next you must provide a count of employees administered drug and alcohol tests at the same time resulting in a verified positive drug test and an alcohol test indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater. Page 5 EMPLOYEES WHO REFUSED TO SUBMIT TO A DRUG TEST requires information on the NUMBER OF COVERED EMPLOYEES who refused to submit to a random or non-random (pre-employment, post-accident, reasonable suspicion, return to duty, or follow-up) drug test required under the FTA regulation. Page 5 DRUG TRAINING/EDUCATION (Section E) requires information on the number of covered employees and supervisor y personnel who have received drug training during the current reporting period. Page 5 FTA FUNDING SOURCES (Section F) asks for the sources of FTA funds for your organization. Simply place a check mark by each applicable funding section(s).

The most likely source for this information is the employer's personnel department. These counts should be based on the recipient's or contractor 's records for the reported year. The TOTAL is a count of all covered employees for all categories combined, i.e., the sum of the columns. Page 3 ALCOHOL TESTING INFORMATION (Section C) requires information for alcohol testing by category of testing. All numbers entered into the pre- employment category section of the table should be separated into the category of employment for which the person was applying or transferring. The other categories are for employee testing and require information for employees in covered positions only. Each part of this table must be completed for each category of testing. These categories include: (1) random, (2) post-accident, (3) reasonable suspicion, (4) return to duty, and (5) follow-up testing. These numbers do not include refusals for testing. A sample section of the table with example numbers is presented on page iv. Four types of information are necessary to complete this table. The first blank column with the heading \" NUMBER OF SCREENING TESTS ,\" requires a count for all screening tests conducted for each employee category. The second blank column with the heading \" NUMBER OF CONF IRMATION TESTS ,\" requires a count for all confirmation alcohol tests performed for each employee category. The third blank column with the heading \"NUMBER OF CONFIRMATION TEST RESULTS EQUAL TO 0.02, BUT LESS THAN 0.04,\" requires a count for each employee category of completed alcohol tests that resulted in an alcohol concentration equal to or greater than 0.02, but less than 0.04. The fourth blank column with the heading \"NUMBER OF CONFIRMATION TEST RESULTS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 0.04,\" requires a count for each employee category of completed alcohol tests that resulted in an alcohol concentration equal to or greater than 0.04. Note: For return to duty testing, a confirmation result equal to or greater than 0.02 is a violation of the alcohol rule. Therefore, if the number of results equal to or greater than 0.04 is unknown, you may report all results in the third column of the table. Each column in the table should be added and the answer entered in the row marked \"TOTAL\". A sample table is provided on page iv with example numbers. Page 3 Below the part of the table containi ng pre-employment testing information are three boxes. This information should be available from the safety program manager or the alcohol program manager. 1) \"Number of persons denied a position as a covered employee following a pre-employment alcohol test indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater\". This is a count of those persons who were not placed in a covered position because they took a breath test t hat resulted in an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or higher. 2) \"Number of accidents, as defined by the FTA alcohol testing regulation, which resulted in a post-accident al cohol testing indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater\". This is a count of fatal and non-fatal accidents which resulted in post-acci dent breath alcohol tests indicating a concentration of 0.04 or greater for an y employees involved in the accident. 3) \"Number of fatalities resulting from accidents which resulted in a post- accident alcohol test indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater\". This is a count of fatalities in ac cidents which resulted in post-accident alcohol tests indicating a concentration of 0.04 or greater for any employees involved in the fatal accidents. Page 4 Following the table that summarizes ALCOHOL TESTING INFORMATION , you must provide the number of employees who engaged in alcohol misuse who were returned to duty in a covered position during this reporting period (having complied with the recommendations of a substance abuse professional as described in FTA regulations ). This information should be available from the personnel office and/or alcohol program manager. SAMPLE APPLICANT TEST RESULTS TABLE The following example is for Section C, ALCOHOL TESTING INFORMATION , which summarizes pre-employment testing results. The procedures detailed here also apply to the other categories of testing in Section C whic h require you to summarize testing results for employees. This example uses the categories \"Revenue Vehicle O peration\" and \"Armed Security Personnel\" to illustrate the proc edures for completing the form. A Screening tests were performed on 157 job applicants for revenue vehicle operator positions during the reporting year. This info rmation is entered in the first blank column of the table in the row mark ed \"Revenue Vehicle Operation\". B Confirmation tests were necessary for 6 of the 157 applicants for revenue vehicle operator positions. Enter this information in the second blank column of the table in the row marked \"Revenue Vehicle Operation\". The confirmation test results for these 6 applicants were the following: Applicant Confirmation Result #1 0.04 #5 0.03 #6 0.02 C The confirmation test results for 2 of the applicants for revenue vehicle operator positions were equal to or greater than 0.02, but less than 0.04. Enter this information in the fourth blank column of the table in the row marked \"Revenue Vehicle Operation\". D The confirmation test results for 3 of the applicants for revenue vehicle operator positions were equal to or greater than 0.04. Enter this information in the third blank column of the table in the row marked \"Revenue Vehicle Operation\". E The last row, marked \"TOTAL\", requires you to add the numbers in each of the columns. With this example, 157 applicants for revenue vehicle operator positions and 107 applicants for armed security personnel positions were subjected to screening tests. The total for that column would be 264 (i.e., 157 + 107). The same procedure should be used for each column. (i.e., add all the numbers in that column and place the answer in the last row). Please note that our sample data collection form also has information for armed security personnel on line two. The same procedures outlined for revenue vehicle operators should be followed for entering the data on armed security personnel. With applicants for armed security personnel positions, 107 screening tests conducted resulting in 3 confirmation tests. No confirmation results were equal to or greater than 0.02, but less than 0.04; and the confirmation test result for 1 of the armed security personnel applicants was equal to or greater than 0.04. This information is entered in the ro w marked \"Armed Security Personnel\".

These regulati ons are 49 CFR Part 653, \u2014Prevention of Prohibited Drug U se in Transit O perations,\" and 49 CFR Part 654, \u2014Prevention of Alcohol Misu se in Transit Operations.\" In addition, the U.S. Department of Tra nsport ation ( DOT) i ssued 49 CFR Par t 40, \u2014 Procedures for Tra nsportation Workplace a procedures to be followe d. On December 18, 2000 the DOT signif icantly revised the Part 40 regulations to update the rule and to address changes i n technol ogy, the testing indust ry, and the DOT's program s. Similarly, FTA update d, revis ed, and combi ned its drug a nd alcohol testing rule s (Parts 653 and 654 respective ly) into a new regul ation, 49 CFR Part 655. The ne w Pa rt 40 and Part 655 we nt into effect on August 1, 2001. To acc ompa ny the testing re gulations , the FTA published I mplementation Guidelines for Drug and Alcoho l Regulations in Mass Transit . The guidelines were writt en to assist transit agenci es to de velop drug and alcohol testing progr ams that are base d on th e FTA a nd DOT r ules. The gui delines contain copi es of t he regulations , a list of certified laboratories, a c onforming product s list, ter ms and defi nitions, frequentl y asked questions and a nswers, and ot her useful i nformation. The Implem entation Guidelines will be re vised to reflect the rule changes and a supplemental \u2014B est Practices \" manual will be published to assist transit systems in com plying with the new rules. The FTA also publishes the FTA Drug and Alc ohol Regul ation Update s several times a year to inform the transit industry te chnical amendments , FTA i nterpret ations , and clarif ications to the rule. In 1997, t he FTA bega n auditing the drug and alco hol testing programs of transit syste ms and stat e depart ments of transportation. The audits seek to ensure that transit systems are compl ying with the drug and alcohol testing regul ations and ide ntify whi ch program elements must be changed in orde r for the system to be in compliance. The following checklist is designed to be use d by transit agencies and stat e DOTs. It will hel p transit manager s to conduct a self-assessme nt to determine if they are co mplying with the regulations, and it allows the syste m to identify problem areas and subseque ntly i correcti ations bee n made since the regulations were wri tten and is current to the date of publication.

Appe ndix PRE-EMPL OYMENT DRUG ING All applicants for employm ent in safety-sensitive positi ons or individuals being tr ansferred int o safety-se nsitive posit ions mu st be give n a pre- employment drug test. The FTA doe s not al low any wai vers of pre- employm ent drug tests. Employers m ust get w ritten consent from the appli cant to check t he applicant's dr ug and alcohol te sting records from previous DOT covered em ployers. ployers are required to complete this records check. ining drug t est results from a pre vious employer does not waive the requir ement to conduct a pre-em ploym ent drug test on ne w employees. Does the tran sit agency have on file the negati ve drug test results for all new hires? Does the tran sit agency assign an employee safety-sensitive functio ns only after the employer has a negat ive drug test result for t he applica nt? If an individual has a po sitive pre-employment drug te st he/she cannot be assigne d safety-sensit ive duties. If an individual reapplie s for a saf ety-sensitive po sition af ter a previous posit ive pre-employm ent test, the a pplicant must pr ovide evi dence of successful complet ion of the return-to-dut y proces s including t he compl etion of an e ducation/treatment pr ogram and evidence of w ell- being from a SAP and be en rolled in a follo w-up testing program , before he/she can be assigned saf ety-sensitive duties. The employer must allow the app lican t to discuss the results of the test with a medical review officer prior to making a f inal deci sion to verify a posit ive drug test result. oyers must pr ovide a list of qual ified SAPs t o appl icants who t est positi ve. If a pre- employme nt drug test is cancelled, the applicant is required to submi t to and pass another te st. Is the time between the hire date and t he test date reasonable (less than 90 da ys)? If not, another pre-e mployme nt test is required. Are MROs allowed to report a negative pre-em ploym ent test result for individuals that are unabl e to pr ovide suff icient volum e because of a permanent disability, but have a medical evaluati on that indicates no chemical evi dence of illegal drug us e? Em pre- employme nt test results in insufficient volume , is a contingent offer of em ploym ent made prio r to the medical evaluation? Are you a ware of t he behavior s that consti tute a test refusal for pre- employment tests? Failure to appear for a pre-empl oyment test, delayed test, or leaving the collection site prior to comm encem ent of a test is not a test refusal. Once the collection has commen ced, howe ver, the donor has committed to the proce ss and must comp lete the test or it is considered a test ref usal. Do you ask applicants w hether they failed a pre-employment drug test for another DOT regul ated compan y within the past 2 ement to pa ss a drug test? Do you obtain written consent f rom applican ts requesting test information f rom previous DO T-regulated employers ( previous 2 ye ars)? Do you s end the consent along wit h the request to the pre vious employer? Do you m ake a good f aith effort to obtain the inform ation from the previous e mployers? If the inf ormation is not ob tained within 30 days of this, do you rem ove the employee f rom safety-sensitive duties? Do you document the good faith effort? If you obtain inform ation that an appli cant had a previous non- negati ve test result, do you remove the person f rom dut y until you have documentation that the i ndividual successfully completed the return-to- duty proc ess and has complete d a follow- up testi ng progra m If the person ha s not s uccessfully completed the return-to-dut y proces s or the follow -up testing program , have yo u ma de arrangements to pick up where the em ployee lef t off? Do you conduct a pre-em ploym ent test on em ployees that have been absent from t heir sa fety-sensiti ve positions for 90 days or more regar dless of the reason, a nd not i ncluded in the random selection pool during the timeframe? TESTING Have the circum stances that warranted reasonable suspicion tests been justified using the minimum cri teria speci fied in the regulation? FTA re gulations require a safety-sensitive employee to s ubmit to a test when the employer has re asonabl e suspicion t hat the employee has used a prohibited drug or has misused alcohol as defined in the regulations. The request t o undergo a reasonable s uspicion test must be based on \"specifi or body odor of the safety-sensitive empl oyee.\" If one super visor, or other company official t rained to identify the signs and sym ptoms of drug and alcohol use, reasonably conclud es that objective facts may indicate drug use or alcohol misuse , this is suff icient justif ication for testing. Only on e supervi sor is require d by FTA; employer s may r equire two or more . Is comprehensive doc umentati on avai lable for all reasonable suspicion tests? Have all supervis ors or other compa ny off icials receiv ed the requisite reasonable suspicion training? A super visor or other comp any offici al that will be called upon t o make a reasonable suspicion determination must be trained in the facts, circumstances, physi cal evidence , physical signs an d symptoms, or patter ns of perfor mance and/or behavi or that are associat ed wit h use (See Training). Super visors must be trained in the proper pr ocedure s for confronting and referring th e employee for testing. Have only trained supervisors made reasona ble suspici on deter minations? Only a trained supervi sor can make a reasonab le suspici on deter mination. The ter m \u2014supervisor \" refers to the job functi on, not t he job title. The supervisor who makes the actual obse rvation does not have to be t he employee' s dire ct supervisor, but can be any trained supervi sor or company official withi n the transit orga cion tr aining and be empowered t o take action when they make speci fic, articulabl e, and c ontemporaneous observations of the appearance, speech, be havior, or bo dy odor of the employee that are consistent wit h probabl e drug a buse or a lcohol misuse. Testing i n place to have e mployees procee d immediately to a collection site f ollowing a reasonabl e suspicion det ermination? Once a supervi sor has ma de a reasonabl e suspicion dete rmination, the employee must pr oceed to the testing site immediatel y. Is there a procedure i n place to document alcohol tests that are dela yed more t han 2 hours? The e mployer must docum ent the reasons if a test does not take place wit hin 2 hours . Howe ver, this does not give the employer a 2 hour w indow in which to get the test completed. Attempts to compl ete the test must cease aft er 8 hours. POST-ACCIDEN T TESTING FTA re gulations require testing for prohibited drugs an d alcohol i n the case of cert ain transit accidents. Are post- accident tests re quire d for accidents wher e there is l oss of life? Are post- accident tests re quire d for non- fatal accidents unless t he employee can be complet ely discount ed as a c ontributing fact or? A non- fatal accide nt is defined a s an occurr ence associat ed wit h the operation of a re venue service vehicle in which: An indi vidual suffers a bodily injury and i mmediat ely receives medical treatm ent away from the scene of an accident; or One or more vehicle s involve d incur disabli ng damage as the result of the occ urrence and is transported aw ay from the scene by a t ow truck or othe r vehicle; or If the transit vehi cle involved is a rail car, trolley car, trolley bus, or vessel, the transit vehicle in volved is removed fr om re venue servi ce. Employees subject to testing ude all employees whos e funct ions could have contribu ted to the accident including the drive r, dispatcher, maintenance, a nd other ass ociated employees. Note: Accident does not nece ssaril y mean coll ision. If an individual falls while riding i n a vehicle a nd needs to be ta ken to t he hospit al, then an acci dent has occurred, and a post- accident test i s requi red unl ess the drive r can be complete ly disc ounted as a contri buting fact or to the accident . The burden is on t he transit agency to prove that t heir employee s did not , in any way, c ontribute t o the accident. (Fall/ Winter 1995 Update , page 2, Spr ing 1996 Update , page 5) Reasonable Suspicion Testing REMENTS Disabling damage means damage that prevent s any of the vehi cles involved from leaving the scene of t he occur rence in a us ual manner i n dayli ght, after simple r epairs of da mage to the vehi cle that coul d have been oper ated but would have bee n further damaged if so oper ated. Disabling damage does not i nclude damage that could be remedied tempor arily at the scene of the occ urrence without special tools or parts; tire disa blement eve n if no spare tire is available, or da mage to headlights , tail-lights , turn signals , horn, or w that m akes them i noperative. ( Fall/Winter 1995 Update , page 7). Is there documentati on for all acci dents that i ndicate whether or not a test was administered and why? If test s are perfor med for accidents that do not meet thei r FTA defini tion, are the test s clearl y performed under the authority of t he transit syste m using non- US DOT for ms?

Nonf atal Accident Are procedures i n place to deter mine when post-a ccide nt tests must be performed a nd who must be tested? Are procedures i n place to deter mine if an employe e can be completel y discounted a s a contri buting fact or? Is proper explanation provi ded when a dec ision is made not to test? Are polici es and pr ocedur es in place to ensure t hat post- accident dr ug and alcohol t ests are per formed as soon as possi ble? Are procedures i n place to discontinue efforts to obtain a drug test if more t han 32 hours ha ve passed sinc e the accident? Are procedures i n place to document the reason for delays (greater than 2 hours) in the alcohol test? If an alco hol test is not admi REMENTS hours following the accident, the employer must st ill attempt to admini ster the test and must prepare and maintain on file the reason for the test delay. Are procedures i n place to discontinue efforts to obtain a n alcohol test if more t han 8 hours have passed sinc e the acci dent? Is the explanation docum ented? In the unl ikely event that you ar e una ble to c onduct an FTA post - accident alcohol and/or drug test due to circumstances beyond your contr ol (i.e., employee is unconscio us, incarcerated), do you know that you ma y acc ept test results from local or state law enfor cement officer s in lieu of the FTA tests if they will provide you wi th the results consistent with st ate and l ocal law? After Hours Post-Accident Testing Does the tran sit agency have internal polici es and proc edures in place to conduct te sting any ti me individuals are per forming sa fety-sensitive job functi ons? This i ncludes periods of time outside of the nor mal business day. Has t he agency desi gnated the contact person that will determine whether a post-acci dent t est is requi red, wher e to report for test ing, and how t he employee will be transporte d to and from the collection site? Are pr ocedures i n place for accident s occ urring outsid e of the transit agency' s immediate service ar ea? RAND OM TEST ING The FTA regulations requir e random testing of drugs and al cohol for all safety-sensitive employees. This type of te sting ca n serve as a deterr ent against employees be ginning or conti nuing drug use an d alcohol m isuse. Is the tr ansit agency using a scienti fically valid random -number selection method to select s afety-sensitive employees to be tested? Valid me thods i nclude the use of a random -number table or a computer- based random -num ber gene rator that is matched with safety-sensitive employees' i dentificati on number s. The Random Dr ug Testi ng Manual is available from t he FTA Office of Safety and Security. All safety- sensi tive employees in the random po ol must have an equal chance of being selected for testing and shall remai n in the pool , even after testing (i.e., the individual m ay be tested more than one ti me in one year). Post-Accident Testing Random Testing Appe the tran sit agency have a procedure i n place t o ensure that the minimum num ber of test s is conducte d? In 2001, t he number of random drug t ests to be conducte d must equal at least 50 percent of t he total num ber of saf ety-sen sitive employees and 10 perce nt for alcohol t esting (a slightly higher num ber should be tested to allow for cancelled tests) . If the transit syste m joins a consor tium, t he number of te sts to be conduct ed ma y be calculated f or each individual consorti um organi zational member or for the total num ber of safety- sensitive employees with in the consortium, but must equal 50 percent and 10 perc ent at a mini mum. To acc ount for fl uctuating e mployee base s, does t he transit a gency base the num ber of random tests per testin g period on t he number of sa fety- sensi tive employees at the begi nning of t he testing peri od? Has t he transit agency ba sed the frequency of ra ndom number selections (quar terly, mont hly, we ekly, or daily) on the expected nu mber of random tests each year? (See the S pring 1996 Updat e, page 3) Is group testing avoided? Is there a procedure i n place t o ensure that t est dates are spread reasona bly throughout t he year i n a pattern that i s not predictable? Are tests distributed t hroughout t he draw period, and t hroughout the day/shift? If safety-sensitive f unctions are perf ormed on weekends and holidays, are tests perform ed on week ends and holidays? The num ber of tests conducted each week, mont h, or quar ter shoul d remain f airly constant. Testing shoul d be per formed at varying ti mes throughout t he work s hift, on di fferent days of the wee ks, and a t different times throughout t he annual cy cle. (Fall/Wint er 1996 Updat e, page 5) Is the tr ansit syste m awar e that a ra ndom drug te st can be performed any time an employee is on duty, wherea s a random alcohol te st can onl y be performed just bef ore, dur ing, or just after the performance of a safety- sensi tive job functi on? Are procedures i n place to ensure that once the employee is not ified that he or she has been rand omly selected for a test they must pr oceed IMMED IATELY to the random numbers subs tituted only when the selected individual will not be performing job dut ies during the test ing peri od? If an em ployee is unavailable during the dra w period due t o vacation or other long-te rm abse nce, a replacement number shoul d be drawn. If an employee is tempor arily una vaila ble at the ti me the employer wishes to conduct the test, or it is their day o ff, the number should be held until their next shift within the same testing period. No em ployee should be excused because of oper ational diff iculties. Is the random num ber sel ection process conducted in strict confidence t o ensure that individuals are not pre- warned? The proc ess must be unannounce d. The tr ansit a gency should establ ish a standar d procedure and practice for no tifying employees that have been select ed for testing. The t ransit agency should arr ange for someone to take over the indivi dual's dutie s while being t ested without givi ng advanc e indication t hat a test will be conduct ed. Are only US DOT saf ety-sensitive em ployees included in the random pool? All safety-sensitive employees must be included in the random pool. If the tr ansit agency deci des to test non- safety-sensiti ve employees, those employee s must be placed in a separate pool a nd tested under the transit agency's authority, not t he FTA' s or DOT's. Are procedures i n place to avoid administrati ve manipulati on of the program if the adm inistrator is included in the random pool? If the transit agency's adm inistrato r is in the random testing pool, some one outside of the pool must be noti fied of the a dministrator's random number selection. When the admini strator's number is randomly s elected a nother employee or res ponsible indivi dual should be designated as the c ontact. This person shoul d sche dule and noti fy the admini strator of the te st and ensu re that the te st is performed imme diately upon noti fication ( Fall/Winter 1996 Update , page 6) . Are procedures i n place to provide privacy to the safety-sensiti ve employee bein g tested? The agency should discreetly notif y the employee to repor t to the collect ion si te. Random Testing Appe ndix indivi duals t hat have knowl edge of the random numbers? Are pr ocedures in place to en sure conf identiality and integrity of the process?

RETURN-TO-DUTY TESTING Following a veri fied positive drug test , an alcohol result of 0.04 or greater, a refusal to submit to a te st, or any other violation of the regulations, the saf ety-sen sitive employee mu st pass a return to duty test, be eval uated by an SAP, s uccessfully complete to action the recomme nded educati on/tre atment program, and be deter mined by the employer to be presently fr ee of al cohol and/or prohibit ed dr ugs, and able to ret urn to work. Is the r eturn-to-duty de cision and su bsequent test made by the employer based on the SAP' s assessments and determination that the e mployee followed the recommende d treatment progra m? Do the r eturn-to-duty procedures reflect that a safety-s ensitive employee must ha ve a veri fied negative drug test or an alc ohol test result of les s than 0.02? If the tests are in complete o r cancelled, the employer must requi re the employee to submit to and pass another test. If an employee has a disability that re sults in insufficient volume, does the MRO report the test as negative i f a medi cal examinatio n shows no evidenc e of illegal drug use? FOLLOW -UP TEST ING Are the minimum requirements for follow-up te sting being met? After returning to duty, the employee is subject t o unannounce d follow- up testing for a mi nimum of 12 months , but not more than 60 mont hs.

Is the SAP r ecomme nded schedule for follow-up testing being f ollowed? The follow- up te sting pla n may not be releas ed to the employee. Return-to-Duty that are s ubject to f ollow-up testing also included in the random t esting pool and t ested wh enever t heir name comes up for random t esting? If an employee has a disability that re sults in insufficient volume, does the MRO report the test as negative i f a medi cal examinatio n shows no evidence of drug use? BLIND PERFOR MANCE TEST ING Transit agencies, employers, and C/ TPAs that have ov er 2,000 covered employee s are required to perform bli nd sa mple pr oficie ncy testing as a qualit y ass urance measure for the testing laborat ory. Does the agency, TPA have over 2,000 saf ety-sensitive employees? If the above is true, does the age ncy have procedures in place to conduct blind per formance testing? For each labor atory that analyzes 100 or more specimens per y ear, employers are requi red to subm it quality contr ol speci mens to the laboratory at a rate of 1 pe rcent for every 100 employee specim ens sent f or testin g, up to a ma ximum of 100 blind sample s per quart er. Are the s pecimens provided i n such a way that the labor atory does not know they ar e qualit y control spec imens? Are the blind specimen s evenly sprea d throughout the year? Are 75 percent of the blind specimens drug/met abolite f ree? Are 15 perce nt of the bli nd specimens spike d with a known drug or m etabolite? Are 10 perc ent of the blind specimens either substituted or adulterated? TRAIN ING TRAINING F OR SAFETY -SENS ITIVE EMPLOYEES Does the tran sit agency display and distribute addi tional information regar ding the prohibited drug use and alc ohol mi suse policy a nd progra m?

Has t he transit agency pr ovided sa fety-sensitive employees with infor mation concerni ng the effects of alcohol misuse on indivi dual healt h, wor k, and pers onal life and signs and symptoms of an al cohol problem ? (Training saf ety-sensitive em ployees is not a requirem ent of the alcohol regulation, but is highly recomme nded). Has t he transit agency t rained all safety-sensiti ve employees on the effects of dr ug us e and the indicators of dr ug use? Was the training at least 60 minutes in length? Did t he training cover the effects and conseque nces of prohibit ed drug use on pers onal health, sa fety, and the work envir onment? Did t he training de scribe the ma nifestations a nd behavioral clues that may indi cate prohi bited drug use? Was the training presented in the context of pr ohibited dr ug us e in the workplace, the FTA regula tion, and t he transit agency' s polic y? Are there pr ocedures in place to ensure that all new hires r eceive the traini ng as soon a s possible after hire (i.e., at employee orientat ion)? TRAINING F OR SUPER VISORS Has t he transit agency pr ovided r easonable suspi cion training to all supervi sors that ma y be in a positi on to make reasonable suspi cion deter minations for drug and alc ohol te sts? Was the reaso nable suspicion trai ning at least 2 hours long--60 minutes for the alcohol program and 60 m inutes for the drug progra m (the transit agency can pr ovide more than 2 hours of training to f ully co ver the inf ormation)? Did t he reasonable suspi cion trai ning cover the topics require d by FTA re gulations (See page 5- 17 and 5-19 in the Implementation Guidelines for a training age nda that i s compliant with regul ations)? Does the transit age ncy have procedures in place to train all new hire s and tran sfers in to supervisory positi ons pri or to the time they actually perform duti es where reasonable suspicion determinations might be requi red? stent with t he Drug Free Work place Act of 1988, does the transit agency pr ovide training for t he entire workforce on the importance of maintaining a dr ug-free workplace and the resour ces that are available to worker s that may have pr oblems with prohibit ed dr ugs? Are the e mployees retrained on a regu lar (not requi red, highly recomme nded)? ADMINISTRA TIVE REQUIREMENTS Every transit syste m must maint ain records concerning thei r testing program s for specif ic peri ods of time and submit annual reports to the FTA re garding testi ng program activities a nd results. Transit systems that r eceive funds dir ectly from the FTA must certi fy annuall y that they are in complianc e with the alcohol and drug testing regul ations . State agenci es certi fy on behalf of those transit systems that receive their FTA fundi ng thr ough the state agency. The st ate agency may r equire the transit agencies t o provide cert ification of compl iance. RECORD K EEPING Does the transit system maintain records on their program administra tion and the te st results of i ndividuals for whom they have testing responsibility? Are drug and alcohol program rec ords kept in a secure location wit h contr olled access? Are drug and alcohol records kept separate from personnel f iles to protect conf identiality?

CONFIDENTIA LITY AN D ACCESS TO RECORDS Does the transit system only release testing reco rds and r esults under t he following circum stances? When an employee gives written instruction that the transit syste m may release i nformation or copies of rec ords regarding an employee 's test results to a thir d part y or s ubsequent employer; When, due to a lawsuit, grievance, or proceedi ng initiated on behal f of the employee t ested, t he result must be r eleased to the decisi on-maker i n the case; When an employee provides a wr itten request for copies of his/her r ecords relating to the test(s) (can not be contingent on payment); When an accident investigatio n is being per formed by the National Transportation Saf ety Board (N TSB) and the post- accident test result s are need ed for t he investigation; When records are request ed by the DOT or a ny DOT agency with regulatory aut hority over t he employer or any of it s employee s, or t o a state over sight agency authori zed to oversee rail fixed guidew ay system s; When a cri minal or civil actio n resulting f rom an em ployee's performance of safety-sensitive duties in whi ch a court or competent jurisdiction determines the test information is relevant to the cas e and or ders the employer to produce the infor mation; When required by a state Department of Transportation (DOT ) or grant ee that has oversi ght responsi bility and is required to certify compli ance for FTA. Does the tran sit agency ensure that each r equest for release of infor mation speci ficall y identifies the person to whom t he information is to be releas ed, the circums tances u nder whic h the release is authoriz ed, and the s pecific kind of i nformation to be r eleased? Is this documentation maintained? Confi a separat e release si gned each ti me information i s to be discl osed? FTA recipients that c ontract out the performan ce of safety-sensitive functi ons are permitted to ha ve access to individual test results of thei r contr actor's employee s since the recipient has over sight authority of t he employer . Likewise, stat e DOTs have authority t o have access to testing recor ds of their subr ecipi ents due t o their oversi ght responsibilities. REPORTING FTA requir es that tr ansit agencies co mplete annual re ports summarizing test r esults. The standard reporti ng form is the Management Information System (MIS) form (found in the back of the drug and alcohol testing regul ations) . Transit systems are required to subm it their forms to FTA if they are speci ficall y requested t o do so. FTA wil l select syste ms to submi t reports base d on a strati fied ra ndom sampling tec hnique. Does the transit system complete the MIS forms annually an d maintain for 5 years? Are all forms type d or pr inted in ink or el ectronically ge nerat ed? Are all blanks on th e form com pleted? Is each for m signed by a n authorized off icial of th e tran sit agency? Does the tran sit agency require MIS forms be prepared by it s safety- sensitive contracto rs? If the transit agency sub mits MIS f orms on behalf of its safety-sensitive contr actors, are t he contr actor and transit agency MIS forms bundled an d submitted together? When requested to do so by FTA, are annual reports subm itted to the FTA Offic e of Safety and Sec urity or its designee s by March 15? If the tra nsit syste m is a member of a testing consortium, does the transit syste m review the consortium's repo rts for accu racy and com plete MIS forms with t he consor tium fy to their regional FTA offi ce that their system is in compli ance with th e drug and alcohol testing rules. Has the transit system's certification been aut horized by the system 's governi ng board or authorize d official? The transit s ystem should maintain a record indic ating an a ppropriate l evel of revie w of the program and the cer tification pri or to the signing. Figure 9-3 in Chapter 9 of t he Implementation Guidelines descri bes individuals that mi ght be given aut hority to certify compli ance at various types of or ganization a s well as the r ecords that should be maintained to de monst rate proper granti ng of a uthority a nd revie w. If the transit syste m is a direct r ecipient of FTA fundin g, is the system certifying compliance wi th the Drug-Free Workpla ce Act of 1988, a s well as the FTA's drug and alc ohol te sting re gulations? Do 5311 systems certify com pliance with their respecti state DOT (highly recommended)?
