CooneyAAEP News November 2019 III Position statement on wild horse and burro management released The AAEP board of directors recently approved the position statement, Management of Bureau of Land Management Wild Horses and Burros. The position, developed by the Wild Horse Subcommittee of the AAEP's Welfare & Public Policy Advisory Council, also has been adopted by the AVMA. AAEP Position on Management of Bureau of Land Management Wild Horses and Burros The wild free-roaming horses and burros on lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Western United States are a unique population of animals protected by the 1971 Wild Free- Roaming Horses and Burros Act (Public Law 92-195). This act and subsequent amendments provide for the necessary management, protection and control of these animals on public lands. At present time, the number of wild horses and burros on the range is three times greater than the appropriate management level determined by the BLM. Historically, herd population numbers have increased at the rate of 15-20% per year. Overpopulation has created welfare risks such as starvation and dehydration due to scarce food and water supplies in some management areas. Current population control methods employed by the BLM, including the removal of excess horses from the range, adoption of gathered horses by private individu-als, sex-ratio adjustments and con- traceptive vaccines, have not been successful in achieving manageable population numbers. The AAEP and AVMA believes multiple strategies are necessary for the wild horse and burro population to reach the desired level that optimizes the health of the animals on the range, while reducing welfare impacts caused by overpopulation in areas of limited resources. The AAEP and AVMA endorses the humane management of the wild horse and burro population through a combination of the following strategies: A. Ongoing development and use of long-lasting, effective contra- ceptives in herds where feasible. B. Use of permanent sterilization methods such as spaying or castration in selected herds where repeated capture or darting with contraceptive vaccines is not feasible. The AAEP and AVMA encourages research into other methods of permanent sterilization to prevent pregnancy. C. Continued removal of animals from areas where the range cannot support a growing population because of the danger of starvation or dehydra-tion or where the population numbers threaten limited rangeland resources and wildlife. D. Continued development of new adoption and sales strategies for animals removed from the range. Strategies may include collaboration with private enter-prises within the horse industry as well as public sector and non-governmental organizations so that the animals may be utilized for recreation, companionship or placement in privately funded sanctuaries. E. Unrestricted sale, which was incorporated into the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burro Act by amendment in the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2005, should also be an available management strategy for horses in holding that are over the age of 10 years or have been offered for adoption unsuccessfully three times. Additionally, the AAEP and AVMA supports the BLM's existing policy that allows for the humane euthanasia of wild horses and burros for reasons related to health and welfare, including animals that are seriously ill or injured with a poor prognosis for improvement; irrevers-ibly lame; starved with a poor prognosis for recovery; or dangerous. While safe and effective long-lasting contraceptive methods are under development, it will be years before they are fully tested and available. The AAEP and AVMA believes short-term and permanent steriliza-tion methods combined with greater private-sale and adoption options will best serve the Bureau of Land Management's mission to protect the health and welfare of wild horses and burros.

AVMA Guidelines on AAEP establishes position statement on use of MPA in competition horses At the recommendation of the Performance Horse Committee, the AAEP board of directors recently approved the position statement, Use of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate in Competition Horses. The complete text of the position follows. It is also accessible at https://tinyurl.com/aaepmpa. AAEP Statement on the Use of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate in Competition Horses Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is a synthetic progestin hormone administered to mares off-label in an attempt to suppress behavioral estrus. However, a controlled research study found that MPA was not effective at suppression of behavioral estrus.1 Many veteri- narians believe MPA modifies behavior by producing a calming effect in the horse and does not have a therapeutic benefit that goes beyond this behavior modification. Therefore, the AAEP recommends that MPA should not be administered to horses in competition. Reference: 1 Gee EK, C DeLuca, JL Stylski, PM McCue. Efficacy of medroxyprogesterone acetate in suppression of estrus in cycling mares. J Equine Vet Sci 2009;29:140-145. Texas A&M discontinues document retrieval service Texas A&M University has discontinued its Get It For Me document retrieval service, which had been a popular benefit among many AAEP members for two decades. The service provided institutional support for accessing veterinary literature through complimentary database search and document delivery services. The AAEP is examining ways to reinstitute this type of service in some format and will notify the membership of any developments. Stay informed of disease risk with new EDCC app The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC), which provides real-time alerts for risk assessment of infectious diseases for all parts of the horse industry by county or municipality in the United States and Canada, has launched a mobile app version of its online information system. The EDCC Disease Alerts app connects directly to the disease alerts page, making it easy to filter information by disease, state and date. Users have quick access to the disease risk information necessary to make decisions about travel and biosecurity. The app also provides access to disease fact sheets with helpful information about diagnosis and treatment. \"The EDCC is a reliable source for not only quickly assessing disease threats, but also defining progression of disease events,\" said E.S. \"Rusty\" Ford, equine operations consultant, Kentucky Office of State Veterinarian. \"The greatest benefit is reliability of the information posted... enabling us and others opportunity to develop and implement disease-mitigating strategies.\"Protect the health of your clients' horses by downloading the EDCC Disease Alerts app and encouraging your clients to do likewise.

Touch Point: Don't overlook young horse owners for practice growth Young horse owners (18-40 years) may present an overlooked oppor- tunity for veterinarians seeking to grow their practices, according to AAEP market research. Not only do these young owners provide the most long-term opportunity for business, but their above- average involvement in the horse industry adds to their prospective customer value. Compared with older horse owners, those aged 18-40 are more involved in the horse industry and their horses see an equine veterinarian more frequently. These owners also put as much or more emphasis on relationship-oriented attributes as they do on their veterinarian's knowledge and experience. Demonstrating compassion, taking time with the horse, explaining diagnoses and having a pleasant demeanor are characteristics that the younger owner places a higher importance on than older owners. With lower incomes than older owners, the 18-40 segment is the most cost-sensitive but also the most likely to increase their already frequent usage of veterinarians. Young owners are the most likely to expect to increase their usage of veterinarian services over the next few years (8% vs. 5% for those aged 41+), pointing to stricter regu- lations at horse shows and plans to do more preventive care and breeding in the future. To obtain more information about the preferences of this important client group, read the complete Touch research report at touch.aaep.org. Log in to the Touch website using the same username and password that you use to access aaep.org. The bottom line: young horse owners can contribute to your practice's bottom line if you take the time to understand the attributes they most value in veterinary relationships and services.

AAEP News November 2019 IXFoUnDAtion The Equine Welfare Data Collective (EWDC), whose funding partners include the AAEP Foundation, has released its inaugural report assessing data from 2017 and the first half of 2018 of at-risk and transitioning equines and the organizations assisting them. The EWDC analyzed responses from 253 nonprofit, 501(c)(3), and municipal organizations across the United States and Puerto Rico, which represented 27.59% of the total population of those organizations that take legal custody of at-risk equines and those in transition. The data analysis is reported on a national and regional level. Respondents varied widely, from small capacity organizations capable of caring for fewer than 10 equines at any one time, to larger organizations with capacity for over 100 equines. Organizations most commonly obtained custody of at-risk and transitioning equines through owner surrenders or assisting law enforcement seizures. Adoptions represented 79.95% of all reported outcomes for the first half of 2018. Presently, it is out of the scope of the EWDC survey to make national projections based on the sample size. However, it is promising to note that the respondents, representing one quarter of all welfare organizations, reported a total capacity of over 13,000 equines at any one time.\"This data report is a steppingstone to understanding the demographics of at-risk equines and those in transition, the needs of the organizations taking custody of them, and the opportunities for growth within the community,\" said American Horse Council President Julie Broadway. View the full report at unitedhorsecoalition.org/ewdc. The EWDC hopes to continue to measure progress and identify trends through continued data collection and reporting. All rescues, shelters, and sanctuaries are encouraged to assist in the effort to collect this much- needed data.Equine Welfare Data Collective releases inaugural report X AAEP News November 2019 Benefit: Profit from pre-owned practice equipment Whether you're in the early stages of your career and looking for pre-owned veterinary equipment to grow your practice prudently, or you've recently upgraded and are looking to sell your used equipment, the AAEP's online Equipment Marketplace connects members on both sides of the commerce equation.

His goal was to train veterinarians in modern medicine and techniques as well as provide much needed veterinary support at the races, which draw up to 3,000 horses competing across the countryside under child jockeys at distances between 15 and 50 kilometers. Accompanied by Dr. John Haffner of Murfreesboro, Tenn., the expedition began as a two-week mission composed of a three-day workshop of classroom and wet lab instruction on diagnostics and treatments for common ailments such as lameness, colic and respiratory disease; and on-site care at the races, which helped build trust by showing the effective- ness of modern medicine in a region where many treatment protocols were established 800 years earlier by Genghis Khan. The mission has since expanded to five weeks in the summer; following the three-day seminar attended by up to 60 veterinarians, Dr. Juergens travels the countryside in a Russian four-wheel drive van to provide practical training and mentorship in the field while living with remote vet-erinarians and herdspeople. Following training sessions, Dr. Juergens uses the relationships and trust established to share his Christian faith. \"When we first got there, we didn't know what to expect,\" said Dr. Juergens. \"There were going to be times when our treatment and education would be scoffed at, so that was difficult; and we didn't know if we'd be allowed to come back a second time. \"But we came back the second year and then the third year, giving them education and access to quality medication. Then they really started believing what we were talking about. And when we'd go out and mentor them\u2014whether in the Gobi Desert, up in the mountains or on the Siberian border\u2014we were so welcomed and appreciated.\"To date, the mission has trained approximately 700 veterinarians in every province of Mongolia; some now teach at the country's veterinary school, elevating the level of education for the next generation of Mongolian veterinarians. These trained veterinarians can also acquire Western medicines from a Mongolian-owned and -run pharmacy started by Drs. Juergens and Haffner to aid in the treatment of horses. \"Johnny and I have committed ourselves to this group of veterinari- ans and the care of their horses,\" said Dr. Juergens. \"We've been there enough that we're able to make our training and education culturally relevant. We know what their capabil- ities are and then we teach within those capabilities.\"\"They love their horses, which are an important part of their culture, and we're seeing the quality of vet care improve not only for these horses but other species as well because of lessons taught on the horse.\" Throughout 2019, the AAEP's Good Works for Horses Campaign has spotlighted AAEP-member practitioners whose volunteer efforts are improving the health and welfare of horses.

This study included 102 systemically healthy horses undergoing general anaesthesia for elective surgery. Arterialblood samples were obtained prior to the administration ofpre-anaesthetic medication (baseline), at the end of anaesthesia, when placed in recovery, at 10-min intervals whilst in lateral recumbency, immediately upon achieving sternal recumbency, at 10-min intervals until standing and 1 h after standing (STAND +1). Pre-anaesthetic medication consisted of anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane or sevo flurane. Forty horses received controlled mandatory ventilation (CMV) throughout anaesthesia, 47breathed spontaneously (SV), and 15 breathed spontaneously before CMV was commenced (S-CMV). Overall, PaO 2alveolar-to-arterial oxygen tension difference (P(A-a)O 2) and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2) remained signi cantly lower than baseline at the STAND +1 time point. The only group in which these values had returned to baseline values at STAND +1 was S-CMV. CMV resulted in higher PaO 2at the end of anaesthesia and during early recovery than SV. Highest PaO 2values associated with CMV were also associated with early recovery apnoea. Oxygen supple-mentation in recovery resulted in higher mean PaO 2than horses receiving no additional oxygen. High PaO 2values did not appear to adversely affect outcome. These results indicate that controlled mandatory ventilation during general anaesthesia may result in better pulmonary function in horses. Smartphone-based electrocardiography In this study, Marc Kraus and colleagues in the USA evaluatedthe accuracy and utility of a smartphone-based electrocardiogram (ECG) device compared with a standard base-apex ECG in the horse . ECGs were acquired from 28 client-owned horses at two equine referral hospitals. Twenty- ve pairs of 30-s ECG recordings were acquired simultaneously from 23 horses witha smartphone ECG device (a bipolar single lead recordercoupled to a smartphone with an ECG application) and with a standard base-apex lead ECG; two horses provided two pairs of simultaneously acquired ECGs. In one horse, the ECGs pairs were recorded immediately sequentially. Seven further smartphone ECGs were recorded from ve horses without contemporaneous reference ECGs. Three observersevaluated all ECGs without knowledge of ECG pairing. Inter- and intraobserver agreement between the two ECG modalities was evaluated for rhythm diagnosis and QRS polarity. Heart rate agreement was also evaluated. Intraobserver agreement for rhythm assessment was very high; one observer diagnosed the same cardiac rhythm on both recordings in 24/26 instances; and two observers agreedin 25/26 instances. The polarity of the QRS complex was similar on the ECGs acquired simultaneously by both systems. Heart rates calculated from ECG pairs were within one beat of each other. The smartphone-acquired ECG accurately identi ed cardiac rhythm and heart rate in most horses. In one case, small size of the complexes precluded identi cation of P waves on smartphone-acquired ECGs, resulting in amisdiagnosis. The smartphone-acquired ECG device might allow veterinarians to evaluate and monitor cardiac arrhythmias relatively inexpensively in eld or hospital settings. Skin antisepsis using an alcohol-based rub In this study, Aimie Doyle and colleagues in Canada aimed to determine whether an alcohol-based antiseptic is effective at reducing bacterial counts on equine skin and the appropriate contact time without producing any adverse skin reactions . Samples were collected before and after preparation from clipped sites over both jugular veins of horses and were plated on 3M Petri lm Aerobic Count Plates in duplicate. Trial 1 tested an alcohol-based product (ET-80% ethanol) againsta control of sterile saline at a contact time of 180 s. Trial 2 tested two different contact times of ET-90 and 180 s. All samples were assessed for colony-forming unit counts using an automated 3M Petri lm reader. Data were analysed by Kruskal-Wallis test. The results determined that ET had a meanof 2.95 log 10 reduction from prepreparation to post-preparation colony-forming unit counts. A signi cant difference in log reduction between ET and control was observed. There was no difference in log 10reduction between the two contact times. Mild urticaria was the onlyskin reaction observed and was often present in both ET and control groups. These ndings demonstrate that ET is effective at reducing bacterial counts on equine skin at a contact time of 90 s without producing signi cant adverse skin reaction. Morphological variations in the caudal cervical spine This case -control study by Stefanie Veraa and colleagues in the Netherlands and Belgium investigated the clinical relevance of radiographically visible morphological variations in the caudal cervical vertebrae of Warmbloods . Cervical radiographic examinations of all Warmblood horses (with and without clinical signs) performed between January 2011 and December 2013 were reviewed by a board-certi ed radiologist. Morphological variations recorded included absence of a ventral laminar part of the transverseprocess in combination with a ventral protuberance at another transverse process and the presence or absence of degenerative joint disease of the articular facet joint of C6 and C7. Clinical signs considered relevant included spinal ataxia, restricted flexion of the neck, cervical pain on palpation, abnormal behaviour (e.g. head-shaking Chi-square and multivariable logistic regression were used to compare the cases (245 horses with clinicalsigns) and controls (132 horses with no clinical signs). Morphological variation at C6 and C7 was signi cantly less frequent in horses with clinical signs (23.7%) compared with the control group (38%). Age, sex, breed and degenerative joint disease were not associated with the presence of clinical signs. Radiographic morphological variations in the caudal cervical spine are more common in horses without relevant clinical signs and so should be interpreted with care. Faecal output and colic after standing sedation In this retrospective study, Christopher Thibault and colleagues in the USA aimed to determine time to rst passage of faeces, total faecal piles and incidence of colicin the rst 24-h post-procedure in 246 horses undergoing standing sedation with detomidine, or general anaesthesiawith or without detomidine . Records of all horses that underwent standing sedation or general anaesthesia between December 2012 and March 2016 were reviewed. Patient signalment, fasting duration, procedure performed, drugs administered, time to rst faeces, number of faecal piles during 24-h post-procedureand mention of colic were recorded. Chi-square, Fisher 's exact and Tukey 's post hoc comparison tests were used. In total, 116 and 57 horses underwent general anaesthesia without detomidine (group GA) and withdetomidine (group GA-D), respectively, and 73 horses underwent standing sedation with detomidine (group S-D). Detomidine dose was signi cantly higher in group S-D than in group GA-D. Time to rst faeces was longer (7.1 /C64.2 h), and group S-D horses passed one fewer faecal pile (6.3 /C62.4) than group GA horses. There was no interaction betweendetomidine treatment and preprocedure food withholding and the time to rst faeces or the number of faecal piles in the rst 24-h post-procedure. Overall, seven horses (2.8%) showed signs of colic (5 GA, 1 GA-D and 1 S-D). The authors concluded that detomidine administration, as part of an anaesthetic protocol or for standing sedation procedures, should not be expected to contribute to post-procedural colic. Intermediate patellar ligament desmopathy This retrospective descriptive study by Elizabeth Hoaglund and colleagues in the USA aimed to describe the clinical and ultrasonographic features of intermediate patellar ligament (IPL) desmopathy, its association with other injuries of the sti fle and outcome for return to work following injury . This study included 42 sti fles with an ultrasound diagnosis of IPL desmopathy over a 5-year time period. Data regardingsignalment, clinical presentation, diagnostic imaging ndings, treatment and outcome were described. Intermediatepatellar ligament desmopathy occurred most commonly in the midbody (35/42; 83%) of the ligament, and lesions were predominantly hypoechoic discrete tears (31/42; 74%) that were obliquely detected. Recheck ultrasound examination was performed on 13 horses, the majority (11/42; 85%) either did not improve or worsened ultrasonographically. Despite this, of 25 horses with a long-term follow-up, 23 (92%) returned to work, 16 at the same level or higher. A variety of treatments were used. The clinical signi cance of IPL desmopathy is dif cult to determine because it is usually found in conjunction with other sti fle abnormalities. Although IPL desmopathy rarely shows ultrasonographic improvement over time, prognosiscan be good for return to work. Super cial digital flexor tendinopathy bandaging In this knowledge summary, Rafael Alzola and Sarah Freeman address the PICO question 'In horses with super cial digital flexor tendonitis is bandaging and rest compared to rest alone more effective at promoting healing? ' There is currently a lack of scienti c evidence to suggest that bandaging promotes effective tendon healing following injury. However, rigid bandages signi cantly limit lesion propagation in equine super cial digital flexor (SDF) tendinopathies. The result of this PICO question suggests that a short period (10 days) of cast immobilisation during the initial in flammatory phase of the injury improves prognosis by limiting lesion propagation. The level of con dence in the outcomes from the body of evidence in the four studies identi ed is moderate. S. WRIGHT EVE EDITORIAL OFFICE References Alzola, R. and Freeman, S.L.

WWW.RRVP.COM 800.728.1654 Case Report The outcomes of epidural anaesthesia in horses with perineal and tail melanomas: Complications associated with ataxia and the risksof rope recovery A. R. Bird*, S. J. Morley, C. E. Sherlockand T. S. Mair Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge; andBell Equine Veterinary is a common neoplasm in horses, with a high rate of incidence in the perineum and ventral tail. Surgical excision is often recommended to remove such masses and can be achieved in the standing horse either via local inltration of local anaesthetic, or via epidural administration of a local anaesthetic and/or an adrenergic a2receptor agonist. The clinical records of all horses with tail and/or perineal melanomas that received epidural anaesthesia at a single equine hospital, over a 7-year period, were reviewed to determine the drugs administered and complications associated with the epidural injection. Twenty- ve cases were identi ed, ve of which received epidural anaesthesia on two occasions. Epidural anaesthesia was insuf cient allow surgical melanoma excision in two horses; repeated epiduralinjection allowed suf cient loss of sensation in one of these horses and additional regional in ltration of local anaesthetic allowed completion of surgery in the other. Three horsesdeveloped signi cant ataxia associated with epidural anaesthesia, two of which became recumbent. Bothrecumbent horses were placed under general anaesthesia, and in one of these, rope-assisted anaesthetic recovery resulted in additional complications associated with facial nerve paresis, fractured ribs and a fracture of the rst coccygeal vertebra, with associated neurological dysfunctionof the rectum, anus, tail and surrounding skin. Introduction Melanoma is a common neoplasm in horses (Cotchin 1977; Moore et al. 2013; Knowles et al. 2015), most frequently occurring in the dermis (Foy et al. 2002; Pilsworth and Knottenbelt 2006). Since early surgical removal is not associated with an increased incidence of re-growth or invasiveness (Rowe and Sullins 2004; Pilsworth and Knottenbelt 2006), removal is often recommended (Groom and Sullins 2018). Surgical excision of melanomas from the perineum and tail while standing is possible, following either in ltration of local anaesthetic or epidural anaesthesia (Grosenbaughet al. 1999), thereby removing the risks associated with general anaesthesia (Johnston et al. 2002; Dugdale et al. 2016). Injection of a variety of drugs at varying doses into the epidural space between coccygeal vertebrae one and two have been reported (Doherty and Valverde 2006; Skardaet al. 2009; Dugdale 2010; Carpenter and Byron 2015). Thereare limited publications, however, comparing the differentprotocols, either in terms of their ef cacy or side effects (Fikes et al. 1989; Grubb et al. 1992; Wittern et al. 1998). This report summarises epidural anaesthesia injections administered to horses with tail and/or perineal melanomas,at a single hospital over a 7-year period. Associated complications are described. Cases The clinical records of horses with tail and/or perineal melanomas which received epidural anaesthesia at Bell Equine Veterinary Clinic between 2011 and 2017 were reviewed. Twenty- ve horses were identi ed, ve of which had received epidural anaesthesia on two occasions. Allhorses, with the exception of Cases 3 and 19, received epidural anaesthesia to allow standing surgical removal of their melanomas. Case 3 received epidural anaesthesia to allow a peri-rectal biopsy, while Case 19 received epidural anaesthesia to allow partial tail amputation, following a severe laceration and associated tail fracture. Extensive melanomas involving the tail in Case 19 prevented laceration repair and were suspected to have contributed to the associated fracture. The signalment of the horses, reasons for epidural anaesthesia, drugs administered and associated complications are summarised in Table 1. Epidural injections were performed at the inter-coccygeal space between the rst and second coccygeal vertebrae. All horses were sedated with injection. The skin over the site for injection wasclipped and aseptically prepared before 20 -40 mg (total volume 1 -2 mL) of mepivacaine (Intra-Epicaine) 4was locally inltrated intradermally and subcutaneously. The injectate (Table 1 ) was drawn up in a sterile manner without an air pocket in the syringe. An 18 gauge 3.5-inch spinal needle5 was advanced perpendicularly to the skin, in the midline over the identi ed space in a sterile manner. Correct placement of the spinal needle was presumed following a positivehanging drop response (Grosenbaugh et al. 1999) and lack of resistance to injection. The injectate was administered over5-10 s. Surgery commenced 20 -30 min later, with the exception of Case 5, where the epidural was repeated 1 hafter it was initially performed.

Lack of movement of the horse in response to commencement of surgery was also used to con rm adequate anaesthesia of the surgical site. All cases received phenylbutazone(Equipalazone, 4.4 mg/kg bwt) 4i.v. at time of surgery. In two horses, epidural anaesthesia failed to block sensation of the surgical site suf ciently. In one horse (Case 5), anal tone and response to artery forceps placement onthe perineum persisted. The epidural was repeated 1 h after the initial injection and anaesthesia was deemed to be successful. In the second horse (Case 16), the area for resection was extensive and additional local in ltration of mepivacaine 4was required to allow resection of the masses at their most cranio-lateral margins. Complications Moderate to severe ataxia ( >grade 4/5 based on the grading system of Mayhew et al. 1978) occurred in three horses (Cases 10, 24 and 25b). In two of these horses (Cases 10 and 25b) the ataxia resulted in recumbency, and in one case (Case 25b), further complications occurred secondary to the subsequent recovery. Case 10 A 20-year-old mare, weighing approximately 450 kg, presentedfor melanoma removal. Sedation was achieved with 20 mg romi dine hydrochloride 1i.v., before caudal epidural anaesthesia was performed 100 mg xylazine hydrochloride (Chanazine 10%)6and 50 mg mepivacaine4, diluted to a total volume of 11 mL with 0.9% NaCl (Vetivex 1)4. Approximately 25 min after epidural injection, the mare became severely ataxic on her hind legs, progressing tobilateral hindlimb paralysis and recumbency. Further sedation (25 mg romi dine hydrochloride 1) was administered i.v. and general anaesthesia induced with 1.2 g ketamine(Narketan) 2and 10 mg diazepam (Diazepam injection)7i.v. The mare was placed onto a rescue glide and transferred toa padded anaesthesia recovery box. Surgical removal of the melanomas was performed and the mare allowed to recover spontaneously from anaesthesia. Recovery of full hindlimb function took 3 h, during which time the mare was kept recumbent with sedation and given supportive care. An AnimaRescue and Carriage Sling 8was placed and once the mare stood on a second attempt the sling remained in placeto provide support for a further 2 h. After this time (7 h after the epidural was placed) the mare returned to her stable and was discharged the following day with no further complications. Case 24 A 10-year-old gelding, approximately 500 kg, presented for perineal melanoma removal. Following sedation with 5 mg detomidine hydrochloride2and butorphanol tartrate3, administration of 100 mg xylazine hydrochloride6and 70 mg mepivacaine4, diluted to a volume of 6 mL with sterile water (Water for injections)9was performed. Surgery commenced 30 min later. During surgery, the horse leant on one side of the stocks, and when walked from the stocks 1 h following epidural injection, severe ataxia (grade 4/5) andhindlimb weakness were present. The horse 's mentation appeared normal, suggesting recovery from the sedationgiven at the time of epidural. The horse was walked slowly to a stable with traction applied to the tail as he was moved. Normal hindlimb function returned over the following 3 h and no further complications were noted. The horse was discharged the following day. Case 25b A 20-year-old gelding, approximately 500 kg, presented formultiple melanoma removal. Tail and perianal melanomas had been removed under epidural anaesthesia (100 mg xylazinehydrochloride 6) 2 years previously (Case 25a) with no complications. Detomidine hydrochloride2(6 mg) and butorphanol tartrate3(6 mg) were administered i.v. and 100 mg xylazine hydrochloride6and 40 mg mepivacaine4, diluted to 4 mL with sterile water for injection9, were administered epidurally. Approximately 15 min following epidural injection,the horse became mildly ataxic on his hindlimbs but remained standing. Laser excision of tail and perineal masses commenced approximately30 minpostepidural. Following completion of surgery, 45 min post epidural, an attempt was made to walk the horse from the stocks. Severe hindlimb weakness was apparent and he became partially recumbent in a dog sitting position. Xylazine hydrochloride 6 (40 mg) was administered i.v. and general anaesthesiainduced with 1.6 g ketamine 2. A rescue glide was used to move the horse to a recovery box for a rope-assistedrecovery from anaesthesia (Hubbell 1999). Forty minutes following induction of anaesthesia, the horse attempted to stand. Marked hindlimb ataxia and generalised weakness were observed and the horse fell heavily into lateral recumbency on several occasions. He was re-sedated with 30 mg romi dine hydrochloride 1and general anaesthesia re-induced with 1.7 g ketamine2. Based on the experience with Case 10, the horse was kept anaesthetised (300 mg ketamine2every 10 -15 min) until 3 h 15 min after epidural administration, at which time he was once againallowed to recover from anaesthesia. Multiple further attempts to stand were made. On one occasion, after standing successfully, the tail rope was locked into a rope clutch 10to provide continuous tail support. The horse subsequently fell again resulting in a period of severalseconds of suspension via the tail rope, before the mechanism could be freed. Successful recovery to standingoccurred 4 h 15 min after epidural administration. Clinical examination of the horse once standing revealed tachypnoea (peak respiratory rate 120 breaths/min; Supplementary Item 1 ), tachycardia (heart rate 56 beats/min) and hyperthermia (39.5 \u00b0C). Oxygen was supplied at 10 L/min via a nasal tube and 250 mg flunixin meglumine (Flunixin 9) administered i.v. Over the following 2 h the horse 's ataxia and hyperthermia resolved and his respiratory rate and heart rate reduced to 24 breaths/min and 48 beats/min. The horse remained in the recovery box overnight and following a 20 L bolus of compound sodium lactate4, i.v. crystalloid was supplied at 4 mL/kg bwt/h. Post recovery management and further complications of Case 25b As a result of the prolonged recumbency and falls during anaesthesia the horse had a prolonged period of \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd570 EQUINE VETERINARY Sorum-USAAmelie Tallaj-France 2019-2020 ISELP OFFERINGS FRANCEGrosboisOctober 17-19, 2019Proximal Forelimb 2020Stifle KENTUCKY LexingtonOctober 11-13, 2020Sports Medicine Rehabilitation Module Celebrate Our 100th Worldwide Module in Paris France on October 17th! 17th!

Facial nerve paralysis was apparent on standing but resolved over the following 2weeks. Multiple ribfractures were present (Fig1)resulting in amild which resolved over 5days without speci ctherapy. The most important complication was that oftailfracture and associated lossof neurological function. Paralysis ofthe tail was noted after standing, with absence ofskin and deep pain sensation tothis area. In addition, skin sensation was absent from a10-cm diameter region dorsal tothetail, although aresponse todeep pain, albeit reduced, was present. Reduced anal tone and skin sensation around the anal ring and perineum were also present. Radiographs the following fracture fragment. opacity fractured was present (suspected tobethe result ofair entrapment during epidural placement). Neurological assessment ofhindlimb function was normal but the horse developed arectal impaction which required extensive medical treatment over 6weeks. Seven weeks post epidural the horse was discharged home. Atthistime, marked muscle atrophy ofthetailhead was present, and repeat radiographs showed that further fracture and displacement ofthe rstcoccygeal vertebra had occurred (Fig3).With the exception ofthe tail, which remained paralysed with lack ofdeep pain sensation, perineal skinsensation and anal tone had complete paralysis ofthe tailremained, but anal tone and perineal sensation were normal. The horse was ingood bodily conditio reported epidural administration ofxylazine hydrochloride toCase 5,nolossof sensation was detected during the hour post epidural and anal tone remained normal. Had part, orallofthe initial injectate been successfully placed intheepidural space, but the continued sensation been due todelayed onset, early repeated epidural injection may have increased cranial spread oftheinjectate, and increased theriskofataxia. Due toreported itwas insuf cient toallow fullresection. This may have been because while using epidural anaesthesia melanoma removal, local in25ofthe28remainingcases. While the weights ofthe majority ofthe horses were not recorded, based onheight and breed, itisestimated that most horses received 0.17 -0.25 mg/kg bwt on todraw conclusions over the effect ofdose bwt) on ataxia. Itisworth noting, which developed ataxic complications were notthesmallest ofthe horses presented. One case (Case have Noataxia dinthis pony, despite being given anepidural dose ofxylazine hydrochloride above that where ataxia began tobecome apparent ininitial studies byLeBlanc etal.(1988). The recommended drugs and epidural anaesthesia vary rstcoccygeal vertebra with ventral and tail. soft tissues adjacent tothefractured vertebra. EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 20192015). The majority of cases we report received only xylazine hydrochloride, diluted to a volume of 10 mL with 0.9% NaCl or sterile water for injection. LeBlanc et al. (1988) reported that 0.17 mg/kg bwt xylazine hydrochloride diluted to 10 mL with0.9% NaCl induced 2.5 h of local analgesia without side effects. This dose has subsequently been repeatedly recommended (Robinson and Natalini 2002; Doherty and Valverde 2006; Skarda et al. 2009; Dugdale 2010; Carpenter and Byron 2015). There are suggestions that adrenergic a 2 agonists alone produce patchy and variable results (Robinsonand Natalini 2002) and that the addition of local anaesthetic provides more reliability. The recommended doses of local anaesthetic vary, however, as shown in Table 2 . While our cases do not support the necessity in most horses for additionof local anaesthetic to provide suf cient local anaesthesia for tail and perineal surgery, lidocaine has been shown toprovide a faster onset of block compared with xylazine hydrochloride (Fikes et al. 1989; Grubb et al. 1992). The three horses (Cases 10, 24 and 25b) which developed ataxia all received a combination of xylazine hydrochloride and mepivacaine via epidural injection, whereas none of the horses that received xylazine hydrochloride alone developed signi cant ataxia. Based on the approximated weights of these horses, the doses equated to mepivacaine arelower than those recommended in the literature ( Table 2 ). Four other horses received xylazine hydrochloride andmepivacaine combinations, however, and did not show any signs of ataxia (Cases 4, 9a, 12b and 20). Case at 0.15 -0.16 mg/kg bwt (assuming 500-550 kg) and also showed no complications. The observed ataxia may have been due to the use of mepivacaine as the choice of local anaesthetic. While thereare recommended doses in the literature, no reports of its clinical use could be found. Epidural administration of lidocaine has been reported, and therefore may have been a better local anaesthetic choice, but ataxia has been reported with lidocaine when used alone at doses of 0.22 -0.45 mg/kg bwt (LeBlanc et al. 1988; Fikes et al. 1989; Grubb et al. 1992). The volume of local anaesthetic administered may also be an important factor in determining the likelihood ofsubsequent ataxia, particularly if any reduction in the epidural space is present. Hendrickson et al. (1998) demonstrated a relationship between cranial spread of methylene blueinjected into the epidural space of horses and the volume used. In women, a nonlinear relationship between the injected volume of mepivacaine and the number of dermatomes anaesthetised has also been shown (Kaneko and Iwama 1999). Administering smaller total volumes epidurally, when local anaesthetics are used, would therefore be expected to reduce the risk of subsequent ataxia. In Case 25b, however, only 4 mL total volume was administered, lower than recommended volumes (Grosenbaugh et al. 1999; Robinson Leece 2012), although these recommendations are for mepivacaine alone. One additional factor contributing to the ataxia in the three horses described here may be the presenting complaint of melanomas. Increased cranial spread of epidural injections has been suggested to occur in obese horses due to a narrowing of the epidural space (Robinson and Natalini 2002), and presence of melanomas close to the spinal cord might have a similar effect. Since discharge, however, neither Case 10 nor 24 have developed neurological de cits suggestive of spinal cord pathology, and the de cits present at discharge in Case 25b have not deteriorated. If signs of ataxia or hindlimb weakness are noted following epidural anaesthesia, support on the tail, by means of a tied rope has been recommended (Robinson and Natalini 2002; Natalini and Driessen 2007; Skarda et al. 2009). However, securing the tail in this way, without the availability forimmediate release, can result in severe morbidity as described in Case 25b. Different variations in the design and use of rope assistance have been reported (K \u20acastner 2010), with no clear consensus as to the best method. One report ofalmost 18,000 horses (Bidwell et al. 2007), where rope assistance was used for the majority of cases, reported a limbfracture rate of 0.04% (8 horses), lower than the 0.2% (84 of 41,824 horses) reported by the CEPEF study (Johnston et al. 2002). The link between rope recovery and this improvedfracture rate is not proven, however, and many other factors, such as length of surgery, may contribute to the difference. A comparison of 200 horses undergoing emergency abdominal surgery (R \u20acuegg et al. 2016), half of which were recovered with head and tail ropes, found no reduction in fatalities orimprovement in recovery scores with the use of ropes. Evidence for the unequivocal bene t of rope recovery is currently lacking (Dugdale and Taylor 2016), with an almost 50:50 split in the use of rope recovery or free recovery as standard procedure by diplomates of the American and Fig 3: Case 25b. Lateral-lateral radiograph of the tail base showing the displaced fracture of the caudal vertebral body ofthe rst coccygeal vertebra with increased ventral displacement of the caudal fragment and tail. There has been further fracture ofthe mid body of the vertebral body of the rst coccygeal vertebrae. There is sclerosis of the fracture line through thevertebral body and a smooth osseous fragment protrudingventrally and cranially from the ventral aspect of the fracture line.The ventrally displaced fracture fragment of the caudal body andendplate is poorly de ned and has become more lucent consistent with osseous resorption. The gas opacity in the softtissues adjacent to the fractured vertebra has resolved. \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd572 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / / NOVEMBER 2019European colleges of veterinary anaesthesia (K \u20acastner 2010). It is unclear in Case 25b whether the complications would have been reduced if the horse had been allowed to recover without assistance, or with a manually controlled tail rope without a locking mechanism. The presence of the head collar during recovery may have contributed to the subsequent facial paralysis, although whether the head collar, or direct trauma from falling was the cause of the nerve damage is uncertain. Rope recovery is only used by the clinic reporting these cases for 'high-risk 'cases. Greater familiarity with the equipment and experience with the set upmay have reduced the likelihood of the complications reported, although complications have been reported by clinics using rope recovery as standard (Bidwell et al. 2007). Administration of i.v. yohimbine (0.05 mg/kg bwt) to mares following epidural detomidine hydrochloride reversed many of the side effects of the epidural, including perineal analgesia and changes in pelvic limb position (Skarda and Muir 1999). Yohimbine administration to horses with ataxia following epidural administration of a combination drugs including an adrenergic a 2agonist may therefore be bene cial, by reversing any synergistic action that the a2agonist has on the local anaesthetic action. It should be noted, however, that yohimbine has been associated with excitation in horses (Zeiler 2015). This concern prevented its use in Cases 10 and 25b, as itwas felt that complications associated with attempts to stand may have increased if excitation did occur, but hindlimb weakness was not fully reversed due to continued action of the mepivacaine. Administration to Case 24 may have beenbene cial, but again, the concern that excitation might increase the risk of falling prevented its use. In conclusion, a 2agonists and local anaesthetics administered epidurally in conscious horses have the potential to cause hindlimb ataxia, postural instability and and Wright 1995; Wittern et al. 1998), and veterinarians should be prepared to deal with theseuntoward effects should they arise (such as facilities to induce, maintain and recover from general anaesthesia). While rope assistance can provide support to ataxic horses, care should be taken when using this technique in horses which have hindlimb weakness post epidural. The three horses in this series that developed severe ataxia all received epidural injections of a combination of xylazine hydrochloride and mepivacaine; in view of the small number of cases it is impossible to ascertain whether this combination of drugs increases the risk of ataxia compared to either drug alone.

Case Report Two cases of hepatopathy and hyperferraemia managed with deferoxamine and phlebotomy L. Gummery* , P. E. J. Johnston, D. G. M. Sutton and A. G. Raftery Weipers Centre Equine Hospital, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Summary The following case report documents the investigation and progression of two cases of hepatic failure and hyperferraemia in Shetland ponies in Scotland exposed to high environmental levels of iron in groundwater, and to the authors 'knowledge describes the rst use of deferoxamine in adult ponies. The importance of consideration of serum ironlevels in cases of equine hepatic disease is highlighted and it is suggested that reduction in serum iron by phlebotomy or treatment with deferoxamine may be bene cial in cases displaying hyperferraemia. Introduction Liver disease in horses is relatively common with ponies beingat greater risk of severe types of disease than large riding horses (Smith et al. 2003). Despite the evolution of more sensitive diagnostic techniques such as liver biopsy theprimary aetiological agent remains unspeci ed in many cases of equine hepatopathy (Smith et al. 2003). Recent publications have focused on identi cation of novel pathogens such as equine hepacivirus (Lyons et al. 2012; Pfaender et al. 2015). The association between hyperferraemia and equine hepatopathy has been explored. Although most reports areassociated with acute overload (post-transfusion in neonatal isoerythrolysis or excessive supplementation [Edens et al. 1993; Elfenbein et al. 2010]), one case series from the Netherlands implicates chronic iron intoxication due to high groundwater iron levels as a cause of hepatopathy in 11 horses (Theelen et al. 2015). Hepatic iron accumulation in people is reported to be due to genetic causes (haemochromatosis, thallasaemia) or toxic, metabolic or viral hepatic disease (Franchini et al. 2008; Abu Rajab et al. 2014). Iron depletion therapy in humans with hereditary haemochromatosis is reported to result in a decreased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis (Beaton and Adams 2006; Kanwar and Kowdley 2013). In horses data to support the speci c role of iron in hepatic disease are limited although haemosiderin accumulation isnoted in advanced liver disease and carries a poor prognosis for survival (Dunkel et al. 2015). In this report, two unrelated cograzing Shetland ponies with no history of iron supplementation exhibited signs of hepatic failure. Extensive hepatic brosis and marked haemosiderosis were found in the most severe case;concurrent hyperferraemia was detected in both ponies. A marked elevation in serum iron also was detected in a mule cohabiting with the ponies with no clinical or biochemicalindication of hepatic failure. Environmental testing of sharedpasture revealed high levels of iron in groundwater. Treatment with phlebotomy and a chelation agent (deferoxamine) was instigated in an attempt to reduce total body iron and associated haemosiderosis. These cases highlight the potential importance of iron in hepatic pathology, indicating a requirement for further research to identify whether hyperferraemia is inciting or exacerbating hepatic disease in horses, or whether accumulation is simply a secondary marker of hepatic dysfunction. Case 1 Case history A 6-year-old Shetland pony gelding was referred to the Weipers Centre Equine Hospital for investigation and treatment of inappetance and lethargy of 7 days 'duration. The pony had been in the owner 's possession for 2 years and was cograzed on several small areas of pasture with oneother pony. Prior to referral the pony had been investigated for signs of respiratory disease (mucopurulent bilateral nasal discharge and pyrexia) of 1 month 's duration. Respiratory signs had resolved following treatment with doxycycline andsuxibuzone, however, 1 week prior to referral the pony had become inappetent. Clinical ndings On presentation the pony was dull with a low head carriage,and was in good body condition (2.5/5 [Carroll and Huntington 1988]; 138 kg). The pony was were congested with a prolonged capillary re ll time (4 s). Distal extremities were cool to palpate. Borborygmi were reduced and the abdomen was mildly distended. Abdominal ultrasonography identi edfluid ingesta in the right ventral colon and caecum. The liver was heterogeneous in appearance. Evaluation ofthe respiratory system (ultrasound, endoscopy and tracheal wash cytology) con rmed resolution of the previous respiratory infection. Clinical pathology A complete blood count revealed haemoconcentration(PCV 48%) and a regenerative neutrophilia with evidence of mild toxic change ( Table 1 ). Signi cant rr <15lmol/L) consistent rr 62-140lmol/L). Blood ammonia was within the normal reference range (17 mmol/L, rr <90 mmol/L). Initial stabilisation A catheter was placed aseptically into the left jugular vein. Fluid resuscitation was initiated with 20 mL/kg of isotonic fluids (Vetivex No 11)1administered as a bolus. Continued rate was guided by sequential clinical re-assessment including PCV/TP. The fluids were supplemented with glucose (2.5%)1and insulin was administered (initial dose 0.1 IU/kg i.m. q. 8 h, thentitrated to effect) to address the hyperlipaemia. As the pony was inappetent, enteral feeding via a nasogastric tube ( bre gruel administered q. 4 h) was introduced to correct the negative energy balance. This wasdiscontinued after 3 days as even transient presence of the nasogastric tube was causing the pony to aspirate saliva. As inappetence persisted despite regular tempting with a range of feeds, total parenteral nutrition (1 L 50% glucose [Steri flex /C226]; 1 L 20% lipid [Intralipid/C226]; 1 L amino acid solution [Aminoven/C226 25] in combination)2was commenced and continued for 6 days until serum triglycerides normalised and the pony 's appetite started to improve. During hospitalisation the ponyalso received supportive therapy in the form of lactulose 3 (0.65 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h) to reduce the risk ofhyperammonaemia and silibinin (milk thistle, 10 g q. 8 h) and Vitamin E (Nano E /C226)4(1250 IU per os q. 12 then q. 24 h) to ameliorate ongoing liver damage. Sucralfate (Sucrabest/C226)5 (20 mg/kg bwt per q. 8 h) and omeprazole (Gastrogard/C226)6 (4 mg/kg bwt per os q. 24 h) were administered whilstinappetent to reduce the risk of gastric ulceration. Case 2 Clinical ndings The 17-year-old Shetland pony mare companion (Case 2) was in good body condition (BCS 3/5) with regional adiposity and a history of laminitis consistent with an equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) phenotype. General clinical examination was otherwise unremarkable, however, the mare had historical records of raised hepatic enzymes and therefore haematologyand biochemistry were re-evaluated. A mild leucopenia was detected and serum biochemistry revealed elevated hepatic enzymes ( Table 2 ) with moderately increased bile acid concentration (23 lmol/L, rr <15lmol/L). The mare was treated supportively with silibinin (milk thistle, 10 g q. 8 h) and Vitamin E (Nano E/C2264, 1250 IU per os q. 12 then q. 24 h). Further investigations In an attempt to identify common risk factors for hepaticfailure in the two animals, further investigations were commenced. Clinicopathological testing A faecal sample was submitted from Case 1 for a modi ed fluke egg sedimentation test and was negative for fluke eggs (Ant /C19onia et al. 2002). Serum iron levels (Day 7 after presentation) were found to be signi cantly elevated in both animals, with a transferrin saturation of 71.4% in Case 1 (rr <40%), 98.8% in Case 2 and markedly increased total serum iron levels of 61.4 lmol/L (rr 18 -35lmol/L) and 100.8 lmol/L, respectively ( Table 3 ,Fig 1 ). Abdominal ultrasound and ultrasound-guided liver biopsy were performed on Case 2. A small hepatic window on theright side of the abdomen suggested reduced total liver size. Samples were obtained from the left and right sides using a biopsy needle (Temno Evolution TMBiopsy Device)7. all hepatocytes ( Fig 2 ) with a cumulative score of 10/14 (Durham et al. 2003). Liver biopsy was not performed initially on Case 1 due to concern regarding the risk of hepatic lipidosis and subsequent capsule rupture. Cograzing equines (CG 1 and 2) Clinical examination and serum biochemistry and iron measurements were performed on the two remaining animals grazed on the same property, a 7-year-old Cob gelding (CG 1), recently introduced to the farm, and a 42-year-old femaleTABLE 1: Haematological and biochemical parameters in Case 1 over the period of treatment.

T. Hevesi*, D. Uto, N. Takacs, V. Lorinczand H. Simhofer Hungarian Rehabilitation and Health Service Ltd., Kaposv /C19ar, Hungary; andEquine University Clinic, University of Veterinary A 9-year-old Hungarian sport horse gelding was presented to the clinic in poor condition displaying malodorous bilateral purulent nasal discharge. Oral examination revealed the presence of supernumerary 111 and 211. Bilateral diastema formation between the third maxillary molars and the supernumerary teeth with deep periodontal pockets and massive food impactions were diagnosed endoscopically. Radiography revealed inhomogenous sinus opacities in the left and right paranasal sinuses. Following bilateral oral extractions of the supernumerary cheek teeth and third maxillary molars, bilateral oromaxillary stula formations were diagnosed (about 17 mm diameter on the right side). Bilateral frontal andright-sided maxillary trephinations and resection of the right bulla of the maxillary septum were performed. Massive food impactions of the left and right paranasal sinuses were removed under endoscopic control. Repeated trans-endoscopic sinus was performed post-operatively. After 2.5 months, thelarge right-sided oromaxillary communication was temporarily closed with a transmaxillary anchored, gauze-cored silicon plug on an outpatient basis. Follow-up examination after 187 days revealed complete closure of the oromaxillary stula and absence of sinusitis. In a 1.5-year follow-up control, nopathological conditions were found. Introduction Oromaxillary stulae develop in 7 -33% of horses following repulsion caudal maxillary cheek teeth (Orsini et al. 1992; Prichard et al. 1992). In contrast, oromaxillary stula formation not associated with cheek tooth repulsion (Hawkes et al. 2008) but with supernumerary cheek teeth has rarely been reported in horses (Quinn et al. 2005). Extraction of a cheek tooth on one side of the stula has been advised to treat this condition (Dixon et al. 2000, 2005; Hawkes et al. 2008). Oromaxillary and oronasal stulae following dental repulsion have been treated successfully using sliding mucoperiosteal flaps (Barakzai and Dixon 2005), by transposition of the levator nasalabialis muscle (Orsini et al. 1992) the levator labii superioris muscle (Brink 2006). Oromaxillary stulae might also treated by alveolar curettage, removal of inspissatedfood and exudate and sealing of the oral aspect of the defect with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) (Tremaine2006). In contrast, silicon-based transmaxillary anchored packing of the alveolus to our knowledge has not been reported in literature.This case report describes the successful treatment of a horse with two large oromaxillary stulae, caused by supernumerary cheek teeth diastemata, treated with ananchored silicon plug following cheek teeth extractions adjacent to the oromaxillary stulae. Case history A 9-year-old Hungarian sport horse gelding (396 kg) used forgeneral riding was presented to the clinic in poor body condition displaying bilateral purulent nasal discharge. According to the owner, the horse started displaying clear mucoid bilateral nasal discharge and periodical coughing at the age of 6 years. It was further reported that the horse had repeatedly been treated with dexamethasone, NSAIDs and penicillin by local veterinarians. When the bilateral nasal discharge turned purulent at the age of 8.5 years, the owner called a veterinary service to re-examine the horse. This examination revealed bilateral sinusitis and bilateral supernumerary 111 and 211 maxillary cheek teeth on the distal aspects of both maxillary cheek teeth rows. Subsequently, the rst and second left maxillary molars (209 and 210) were extracted orally and a left-sided maxillarybone flap was performed to access the left maxillary sinus. During the procedure, small amounts of decaying hay wereencountered in the sinus. As healing was not satisfactory, a frontonasal bone flap with dorsal bullectomy was made by the same surgeons a couple of weeks later. Againinspissated, decaying food was found in the left caudal maxillary sinus. When the bilateral nasal discharge severely increased about 3 weeks after surgery and the horse additionally displayed a lethargic demeanour, substantial weight loss, poor mastication, quidding and halitosis, the owner decided to present the animal at our clinic. Clinical ndings and diagnosis On presentation, the gelding 's vital parameters were within normal limits although the horse was in poor body condition displaying malodorous bilateral purulent nasal discharge. At the areas of the left maxillary and frontonasal bone flaps, signs of wound infection including suture dehiscence with purulentexudate emanating between the former stitches and subcutaneous frontal/maxillary bone sequestration were present. The horse maxillary molars and the supernumerary teeth with deep periodontal pockets and massive food impactions were diagnosed endoscopically. Complete healing ofthealveoli oftheformerly extracted 209 and 210 inthe paranasal and 210 teeth, wide and deep diastema formations between the third maxillary molars and the supernumerary 111 and 211 with severe periodontal diseaseofthe third maxillary molars and the supernumerary teeth were diagnosed (Fig1). Treatment decided toorally extract thelastmolar (211) and and along acting penicillin combination. The oral extractions were completed inashort period oftime due tosigni cant loss ofthe theleftcheek foreign body forceps through the working channel and a variety ofblunt dissectors with varying curvatures toclean performed bytopical application of2%lidocaine spray prior toforeign body removal.

All accessible sinus compartments were rinsed thoroughly under endoscopic control with lukewarm (37\u00b0C)saline solution; chlorhexidine attheend oftherinsing procedure Thealveoli were packed with gauze soaked in 0.2% chlorhexidine solution.

Just before completing thealveolar packing, the stulous tract was debrided with granulation and prevent epithelisation (Fig3).Asmall tied with d(USP 6,8metric) (Fig4b),leaving two 70cm long double strands ofsuture material. The thread ends were guided into theoral cavity, grabbed with haemostats inserted through theright maxillary trephination portal and pulled through theright stulous tract and the right caudal maxillary sinus. The gauze core was centrally embedded infreshly mixed, malleable dental silicone (Bisico S16)(Fig4b,d) .Exerting gentle traction, the construct was inserted into the stulous tract.

Discussion Diastemata commonly occur between supernumerary or dysplastic cheek teeth and their neighbours (Dixon and Dacre 2005; Quinn etal.2005; Casey and Tremaine 2010;Casey 2013). Between the caudal maxillary cheek teeth, severe lesions may erode through the alveolar bone and cause oromaxillary stulation with subsequent sinusitis (Dixon etal.1999; Hawkes etal.2008). discharge atthe age of6years (2years prior totreatment) which, over time, became increasingly viscous and yellowish.

As a result, increasing amounts of feed particles were forced into the diastemata and pressed in an apical direction. The resulting periodontal disease progressed apically which might have caused low-grade sinusitis long before the development of oro-sinusoidal communication occurred. Recurrent nasal discharge was already present 2 years before treatment was initiated, and might have been misinterpreted as a sign of lower airway disease instead of early stage sinusitis. Accurate oral inspection with a mirror or an oral camera is of importance, especially in cases with nasal discharge (Dixon and Dacre 2005) and might have helped in diagnosing the underlying disease earlier in this case. Considering the extent of sinus pathology in this case, surgical approaches via bilateral frontal trephinations appeared to be ideally suited for accessing the frontal-, dorsal conchal-, caudal maxillary-, and sphenopalatine sinuses (Barakzai and Dixon 2014). Inserting a small diameter endoscope through the trephination portals facilitated sinoscopy of the sinus and the ventral conchal sinuses following removal of the bulla of the maxillary septum. Maintaining small openings in the centre of the skin flaps by inserting strips of polyurethane wound dressing (Ligasano/C226) facilitated prolonged sinus flushing and sinoscopic examination of the paranasal sinuses and the oromaxillary stulae. Following oral dental extractions, diagnosis of the large oromaxillary stula and the extent of sinus contamination, the question of how to resolve this pathological condition most effectively was raised and different techniques of stula repair were discussed. Financial constraints of the owner and the long distance between theclinic and the owner 0s home were also considered. In horses, two facial muscles, the temporal (Waldridge et al. 1997) and levator labii superioris (Campbell and Peyton 1984) muscles, have been used for correction of sinocutaneous stulae. The levator nasolabialis muscle has been used for oforosinus stulae (Orsini et al. 1992; Hahn and Kohler 2002) and for reconstruction of maxillary sinus defects (Dart et al. 1994). Transposition of the levator nasolabialis muscle to obliterate an oromaxillary sinus stula is complicated because the muscle is dif cult to mobilise, and its flat con guration can result in a poor t in the dorsal aspect of an oromaxillary sinus stula (Brink 2006). In contrast, the levator labii superioris muscle is ellipsoid in its 2006). Transposition of the levator labii superioris muscle was successfully used for treatment of oromaxillary stulae of the 8th and 10th maxillary cheek teeth alveoli in three horses(Brink 2006). The need for general anaesthesia to perform this procedure, the limited length of the muscle, the distal position and large size of the right-sided stula and the owner 0snancial limitations rendered this technique less suitable. As the stulae were located in the distal aspect of the oral cavity, a mucoperiosteal flap (Barakzai and Dixon 2005) was also excluded. The application of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) alveolar packing was considered a feasible technique (Tremaine 2006; Hawkes et al. 2008). However, this technique was also excluded because of the inability to mould the PMMA to neighbouring teeth, the rigidity of the material and the fact that thistechnique precluded periodic examinations of the progress ofstula healing. Finally, it was decided to pack the alveoli with gauze until increasing granulation precluded a secure to ft h e gauze packing. At this point, dental silicone of moderaterigidity- (Bisico S1) was used to tightly seal the deep but narrow and conoid-shaped alveolus on the right side. The gauze-cored, transmaxillary anchored silicon plug effectively sealed the oral cavity towards the sinus. This technique to pack the alveolus and seal off the oro-sinusoidal communication had the advantage of a long-term use of the same plug. Its tight tc o u l db e checked from the outside and tightening of the anchorcould also be performed by the owner without the need for sedation or special equipment, if needed. Furthermore, the material was easy to mould when soft but could also be easily shaped and shortened with a knife after setting. It resisted the physical and chemical stresses in the oral cavity well and did not cause damage to the soft tissues of the oral cavity. Conclusion Gauze-cored anchored silicon plugs were successfully usedin the post-operative treatment of large oromaxillary stula. The technique proved to be inexpensive and easy to applyalthough an extensive length of time - approximately 6 months - was needed for complete healing. Control of the correct t was straightforward without the need for sedation. Despite an initially guarded prognosis, uncompromisedhealing could be achieved.

Debridement isextremely important because when theorosinuidal communication fails to close spontaneously, itremains patent and gets epithelial ised. The epithelised stula usually has no tendency toheal spontaneously. clot inthe stula after mechanical debridement should beprotected against dislodgement. Inhuman dentistry, primary closure or the use oftissue flaps ofwell-vascularised tissue are performed toprotect thealveolus. The shape ofanalveolus and the rigid tissue around the alveolus impede these methods and make them almost impossible oftissue grafts, such astheuse ofamucoperiosteal flap(Barakzai and Dixon 2005) and an alveolar bone flap (Easley and Freeman 2016), are described in themesial aspect ofthemaxillary approach inthe molar region.

Durket1, V. Albanese2, S. K. Steward3and D. E. Freeman* Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA *Corresponding author email: freemand@u fl.edu Present addresses:1Lloyd Veterinary Medical Center, College of 2Tier\u20acarztliche Klinik f \u20acur Pferde horse; lipoma; colic; small colon Summary In an 18-year-old Paso Fino mare presented with mild colic of 36 h duration, a luminal obstruction was found on rectal palpation in the most oral part of the rectum, and this appeared to be caused by a tight band on the left side. A standing procedure was used that involved pararectal dissection with long-handled instruments to the level of the constricting band, guided by a hand in the rectum. A hooked bistoury designed for treating entrapped epiglottis was used to transect the band, which immediately released the obstruction and allowed manual evacuation of the aboralend of the small colon. The band was most likely the pedicle of a pedunculated lipoma that had encircled the oral end of the rectum. The mare made a complete recovery. Introduction Small colon obstructions that require surgical intervention are rare, with a prevalence of 3.5 -4.2% of horses that had colic surgery in two large studies (Edwards 1992; Mair and Smith2005). They are classi ed as congenital simple obstructions, vascular lesions and strangulating obstructions(Edwards 1997a,b). intussusceptions and pedunculated lipomas (Edwards 1997a,b; Schumacher and Mair 2002). The most common lesions that require surgery in the small colon are impaction, followed by pedunculated lipoma (Mair and Smith 2005; de Bont et al. 2012), and the latter is the disease most likely to require resection andanastomosis in this organ (Prange et al. 2010). Typically, these are seen in horses of the same age group as in smallintestinal cases (Garcia-Seco et al. 2005). However, the distribution of a strangulating lipoma in the small colon canbe 4 -10% of all horses with this disease, compared with 89 - 96% in the small intestine (Edwards 1997b; Garcia-Seco et al. 2005). A lipoma can encircle the aboral part of the small colon and occlude it at the peritoneal re flection, thereby creating a tight luminal constriction that prevents palpation beyond that point (Mason 1978; Edwards 1992). In one such case, the lipoma was removed through a dorsolateral incision in the cranial end of the vagina (Mason 1978). In this case report, we describe a pararectal approach to relieve a small colon obstruction attributed to a pedunculated lipoma at the approximate level of the peritoneal re flection. A pararectalapproach for cystotomy has been described for urolith removal in standing horses (Abuja et al. 2010), and was used in this report to create a narrow path of dissection to theobstruction. Case details Case history An 18-year-old Paso Fino mare was presented to the Universityof Florida College of Veterinary Medicine with a history of mild colic of approximately 36 h duration. Predominant signs were recumbency, sweating, decreased faecal production and anorexia. She was treated with flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg bwt per os) 24 h before admission, but continued to have mildto moderate signs of abdominal pain. When examined by the referring veterinarian 4 h before presentation, the mare was treated with flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg bwt i.v.). The mare had been used for pleasure riding and had never been bred. Clinical ndings On presentation to the University of Florida, the mare was mildly painful, quiet, and dull, and she had a body score of 5-6 on the Henneke scale of 1 -9 (Henneke et al. 1983). Her initial physical examination revealed a temperature of 37.9 \u00b0C (100.3 \u00b0F), heart rate of 60 beats/min and respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min. Mucous membranes were pale pink and thecapillary re ll time was 2 s. Intestinal sounds were within normal limits. Ultrasound examination did not reveal any abnormalities. Palpation per rectum revealed a pneumorectum extending caudally from a rectal constriction about 43 cm from the anus (at the nger tips with the elbow at the anus). The constriction reduced the lumen toapproximately 4 cm in diameter and dry impacted faeces could be palpated at the nger tips oral to the constriction. The most likely diagnosis was a lipoma with a stalk that encircled the aboral end of the small colon, close to the peritoneal re flection. Treatment options discussed with the owner included midline exploratory celiotomy, flank laparotomy and flank laparoscopy. Because of nancial constraints, these options could not be considered. Vaginal access to the site ofobstruction was also considered (Mason 1978), but even a small hand encountered considerable resistance to insertion of the nger tips at the vestibule. Therefore, a pararectal approach (Abuja et al. 2010) was used to relieve the small colon obstruction and associated impaction. \u00a92018 EVJ doi: 10.1111/eve.12898Surgical approach The mare was restrained in stocks, an i.v. catheter (14 gauge mila catheter) was placed in the left jugular vein and she was given xylazine continuous rate infusion of detomidine (25 mg added to 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride) was given for a mean dose of 0.03 mg/kg bwt/h throughout the procedure, with the rate adjusted based on the response to surgical stimulation. A caudal epidural was given into the rst intercoccygeal space with 6 mL of 2% lidocaine hydrochloride. A tail wrap was placed and the tail was heldaway from the surgical eld throughout the procedure. The perineum, rectum and vulva were cleaned with cotton, soapand water, followed by a surgical scrub of the perineal region with povidone-iodine scrub and isosopryl alcohol rinse. To ensure desensitisation of the left pararectal space lateral to the anus, 15 mL 2% lidocaine hydrochloride was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Aseptic preparation with povidone-iodine scrub and isosopryl alcohol was completed after the local anaesthetic agent had been injected. A left- sided approach was chosen because the constricting band could be felt on that side of the rectum. A 10-cm vertical skin incision was made with a No. 10 scalpel blade between the anus and the left semimembranosus muscle and was continued through subcutaneous tissues with the scalpel blade. Digital dissection was continued to establish a natural plane of division between the semimembranosus muscle and the external anal sphincter. Care was taken to avoid damage to the internal pudendal artery and vein and end branches, including the caudal rectal artery, and the pudendal and caudal rectal nerves. Metzenbaum scissors, long-handled Metzenbaumscissors and laparoscopic scissors were used in that order as dissection progressed further cranially. The right hand of the surgeon was inserted in the rectum throughout the procedure to ensure that dissection did not progress too far axially and perforate the rectal wall. As dissection progressed cranially, the mare became uncomfortable, so that approximately 40 mL of 2% lidocaine was infused at progressive increments into the side port of the laparoscopic scissors to anaesthetise tissues at its tip. Once the tip of the scissors was palpated at the band, it was replaced with a hooked bistoury ( Fig 1 ) used for axial division of entrapped epiglottis (77 cm long, 11 mmwide gap between tip and blade) 1. The hook was advanced in a vertical orientation along the dissected plane along therectum until it passed beyond and lateral to the constricting band. The relationship of the handle orientation relative to the plane of the hook was used to direct the position of the hook as needed ( Fig 2 ). Once the hook passed the band, it was then turned with the pointed tip against the rectal wall so thatit engaged the band ( Fig 2 ). The hook was drawn caudally with a short and sharp movement until the surgeon could feelthe band release. Instant release of the small colon constriction followed, and faecal balls could be manually evacuated from the point of accumulation proximal to the level of obstruction. The colonic mucosa was palpated carefully and determined to be intact, and frank blood was not observed on the surgeon 's rectal sleeve. The pararectal incision was left open to heal by second intention. Post-operative management The mare was given 4 L of mineral oil using a nasogastric tube post-operatively. She was fed a pelleted mash andhandfuls of alfalfa hay every 4 h overnight. She remained comfortable and passed many piles of soft but formed faeces. At 12 h after surgery, she was given 230 g magnesium sulfate in 5 L water using a nasogastric tube, and then 18 h after surgery, she was given 4 L of mineral oil by a nasogastric tube. At 12 h after surgery, a rectal examination revealed no abnormalities; however, a clear straw-coloured fluid was expressed from the perineal incision when faeces were removed. The mare was given 2 g of phenylbutazoneorally once daily for 3 days and then 1 g of phenylbutazone orally once daily for 3 days. The mare was discharged from the hospital 24 h after admission. Her aftercare included monitoring of faecal output and her incision site. She was given 7 days of stall rest and then turned out in a paddock. When stalled, she was fed pelleted mashes with salt and small amount of alfalfa throughout the day and then hand walked to graze. At 14 days after surgery, the owner expressed concern about the persistent purulent discharge from the incision and a slight odour associated with it. The mare was behaving normally, with an excellent appetite and attitude, but had intermittent bouts offever. The referring veterinarian examined the mare and found no obvious abnormalities on palpation per rectum, an absence of any swelling along the line of dissection and a normal rectal temperature.

The incision continued to heal from that time, the mare made a fullrecovery, and was alive and doing well at 20 months after surgery. Discussion This is the rst case to the authors 'knowledge of a small colon obstruction relieved by the method described. The most likely cause of the obstruction was a pedunculated lipoma with a pedicle that encircled the small colon or rectum, presumably from the right side of the mesentery as the lipoma passed under the colon to become entrapped on the left side. Other causes are possible, such as an adhesion, an anomalous band or lipomatosis (Riley et al. 2007), but these would seem less common than a lipoma(Edwards 1997a; Mair and Smith 2005; Freeman 2012; de Bont et al. 2013). The pedicle in this case did not produce a complete constriction as the surgeon could introduce twonger tips through the rectal lumen, so the possibility of vascular occlusion in the rectal wall was low. An abdominocentesis was not performed preoperatively, which would have provided a means of assessing mural vascularinjury; however, the subsequent clinical course would suggestthat such tissue damage was unlikely. Although the owner was offered a ventral midline celiotomy, flank laparoscopy or an open flank approach, the method used was the only one affordable. A possibleadvantage of the other options was improved access to the peritoneal re flection at the most oral end of the rectum, which might have allowed assessment of serosalinjury and possibly repair of more complicated lesions. However, access to the pelvic part of the abdomen would have been dif cult by any of these methods with the possible exception of standing laparoscopy (Freeman 2012).A ventral midline approach would also have allowed more complete exploration and could have allowed correction of any concurrent lesions. A standing flank approach would have allowed manual access to the site of intestinalconstriction, but with poor visual guidance and limited opportunity for exteriorising the distal part of the small colon. This approach would have more than doubled the cost over that incurred by our approach, because it would have required draping, gowning, perioperative antimicrobial drugs, suture material, longer hospitalisation, procedure classi cation, and a risk of incisional swelling and dehiscence (Graham and Freeman 2014). Similar concernswould have applied to laparoscopy. Potential complications of the method used were rectal laceration that could have led to septic peritonitis and/or evisceration. This was avoided by dissecting lateral to therectal wall so that the full thickness of all rectal layers was preserved. Although the owner reported a concern about discharge from the incision and an associated odour, the attending veterinarian did not detect an odour and considered the discharge to be within normal limits at that stage post-operatively. Antimicrobial drugs were not given at that time because the attending veterinarian did not nd any evidence of a surgical site infection, including a fever.These drugs were also not used perioperatively because of owner 's concerns about cost and because the surgeons assessed the potential bene ts as insuf cient for a procedure classi ed as clean-contaminated (Ahern and Richardson 2012). Although the fluid discharged from the incision on palpation per rectum on the rst post-operative day was either a seroma or peritoneal fluid, ultrasound examination was not used to assess peritoneal fluid accumulation in the abdomen. This decision was partlydetermined by cost and also by the absence of clinical signs of peritonitis. Other possible complications of the method used include anal sphincter damage, laceration of a major mesenteric vessel, bleeding from the internal pudendal vein (Abuja et al. 2010), and failure to relieve the obstruction. Possibly disruption of the pedicle could tear the mesocolon,which could subsequently entrap intestine. Because the lipoma was probably encircling the intraperitoneal portion of the small colon or rectum, the peritoneal lining was likely breached by the surgical procedure; however, this did not appear to cause long-term complications. Although all the other approaches offered would have allowed complete removal of the lipoma, a lipoma 'lost'in the abdomen would seem unlikely to create a problem(Shoemaker et al. 2004) and appeared to be well tolerated in this case.

The hooked blade of the bistoury could engage the rostral edge of the band after manual guidance into that position ( Fig 2 ) without inclusion of other structures beyond it. The tips of laparoscopic scissors couldnot be inserted between the rectum and band, whereas the tip of the hook could be in this case. The risk with the hook was laceration of the rectal wall, especially as the pointed tip was directed towards the rectum ( Fig 2 ). Directing the hook in the opposite direction would haveallowed the tip to engage the perirectal tissues, which might have prevented a clean transection. Also, this direction of placement was impossible because of insuf cient space between the band and the rectal wall to allow the hook to pass cranial to the constriction. The tipwas easily directed around the pedicle by a hand in the rectum, and was maintained outside the rectal wall at all times ( Fig 2 ). Dissection to the level of the strangulation was deep and required repeated blunt dissection with scissorsand great care to maintain a safe and consistent plane of dissection, away from the rectal wall. Also, the dissection was deep enough to require repeated in ltration of local anaesthetic through the injection port of the laparoscopicscissors as the cranial limits of the original blocks were exceeded. In a previous report of a similar case, also in a mare (Mason 1978), a lipoma encircling the rectum/small colon was removed through a colpotomy in the proximal end ofthe vagina and directly over the point of strangulation. Once located, the lipoma was then twisted off its pedicle to release the obstruction (Mason 1978). The colpotomy was closed in that mare with Backhaus towel clamps (Mason 1978). It was not possible to insert a hand into the vagina of the mare in this report for reasons that were not apparent and not obviously related to her small size. In the previous report, the mare was part Thoroughbred, and therefore of a size that could facilitate vaginal insertion of a hand (Mason 1978). In retrospect, the lipoma in the mare of this report might have contributed to partial vaginal occlusion by compressing the vagina or by including it within its pedicle. However, the point of narrowing in the vagina seemed too far caudal to the site of obstruction in the rectum to support this explanation, and was closer to the level expected for a partially persistent hymen. Unfortunately, the vagina was not examined after the strangulation was released to assess any effect the lipoma or its pedicle had on the vaginal lumen. The serendipitous result of failure to use the vaginal approach was the development of a method that would be applicable to a stallion or gelding. A potential limiting factor in completing this procedure would be a horse too small to accommodate the surgeon 's hand and arm in the rectum. This report underscores the observation that a tight luminal occlusion in the most oral part of the rectum that restrictspalpation beyond that point and causes acute colic in an old horse is probably caused by a pedunculated lipoma (Mason 1978; Edwards 1992). In these cases, a standing procedure like that described in this report would allow transection of the pedicle with long-handled instruments, such as the hooked bistoury or laparoscopy scissors. The cost to the owner should be reasonable with this approach, especially if moreexpensive procedures are not affordable.Acknowledgement The authors thank Dr Steve Murphy for case referral and follow-up.

Clinical Commentary Surgical approaches to the equine abdomen F. T/C19oth*and J. Schumacher College of Veterinary Medicine, The University of Minnesota, St Paul, Minnesota; andCollege of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, author email: ftoth@umn.edu Keywords: horse; celiotomy; pararectal; colpotomy; flank Summary Factors to consider when deciding on a surgical approach to explore the abdomen of a horse include facilities and equipment available, experience of the surgeon, temperament of the horse and the necessity for cosmesis. An approach performed with the horse standing may be necessary when anaesthesia or recovery from anaesthesia is considered risky or when the owner imposes a nancial limitation that does not allow surgery to be performed withthe horse anaesthetised. Approaches performed with the horse standing include the flank and colpotomy approaches. Each approach has bene ts and risks inherent to it. Surgical approaches to the abdominal cavity of the horseinclude the vaginal, pararectal, referred to as a colpotomy. The pararectal approach described in the accompanying article (Durket et al. 2019) is a modi cation of the G \u20acokel 's approach to the retroperitoneal portion of the bladder, described forremoving a cystic calculus. The abdomen can also be explored using laparoscopic techniques, with the laparoscope and instruments inserted at the flank or ventral aspect of the abdomen. Abdominal exploration can beperformed with the horse anaesthetised, using any of the above approaches, or with the horse standing, through a vaginal or flank celiotomy. The accompanying article is the rst, to our knowledge, to describe a pararectal approach to the abdomen. Although the approach, as described in the article, was inadequate to allow exploration of the abdomen, it enabled the pedicle of a mass, suspected to be a pedunculated lipoma, obstructing the rectum to be transected (Durket et al. 2019). Facilities and equipment available for performing surgery with the horse anaesthetised and the nancial limitation imposed by the owner are important considerations when selecting an approach to the abdomen. Procedures performed with the horse standing avoid the inherent risks and cost associated with general anaesthesia. The temperament of the horse, location and nature of the suspected lesion and the experience of the surgeon are also factors that in fluence the decision whether exploration of the abdomen should be attempted with the horse standing. Theabdomen of a fractious horse is best explored with the horse anaesthetised to protect the safety of the horse and the surgeon. The colpotomy approach, usually performed with the horse standing and sedated, limits surgical exploration to the caudalmost aspect of the abdomen, making it unsuitable for addressing cranially located lesions (Colbern and Reagan1987; Hooper et al. 1993). The ability to explore even the caudalmost aspect of the abdomen of a horse through a pararectal approach was not determined by the authors of the accompanying article, because they were able to relieve the rectal constriction by inserting only the tip of a bistoury into the abdomen of the horse (Durket et al. 2019). Previously, the use of pararectal incision has been limited toaccessing the retroperitoneal portion of the bladder in standing, sedated horses to remove cystic calculi (Van Dongen and Plenderleith 1994; Abuja et and perirectal melanomas obstructing passage of faeces(authors 'experience). The necessity for cosmesis or rapid return to function also influences the choice of the surgical approach. The scar resulting from a flank approach may be apparent, even when the abdomen is explored using laparoscopic technique, especially if the wound fails to heal by rst intention. Exploring the abdomen through a vaginalapproach avoids a cutaneous scar and provides rapid return to function. The scar left by a pararectal, paramedian, oblique paramedian or ventral midline approach is inconspicuous, but with the exception of the pararectal approach, the time between surgery and the horse 's return to function is much longer than when the abdomen isaccessed using a vaginal approach. Colpotomy and pararectal incisions are typically left unsutured, saving the time and expense associated with primary closure. Each approach to the abdomen can be accompanied by complications, some of which are inherent to theapproach. The circum flex iliac artery may accidently be transected, for example, when the abdomen is approachedthrough the flank during conventional or laparoscopic surgery. Inadvertent penetration of an abdominal viscus, suchas the large or small colon or bladder, and damage to the cervix are reported complications of vaginal celiotomy (Moll and Slone 1997). Another complication of this approach is fatal haemorrhage, which can occur if the surgeon perforates the vaginal branch of the uterine artery while penetrating the fornix of the vagina to enter the abdomen. The mare is at slight risk of evisceration after vaginal celiotomy, because the celiotomy is usually left unsutured. Adhesion of a viscus to the site of celiotomy, though frequent, is seldom troublesome (Colbern and Reagan 1987). The pararectal approach also has its inherent complications and drawbacks. Anatomical structures located in the path of dissection include the internal pudendal artery and vein, along with their branches, the ventral perineal and caudal rectal arteries and veins. Preserving the pudendal nerve and its branches is critical to maintain innervation of the perineum doi: 10.1111/eve.12909dissection less straightforward than other approaches. An incision into the abdomen using the pararectal approach might also put the horse at risk of evisceration, if the incision is large enough to allow introduction of a hand and arm into the abdomen. A factor unique to the pararectal approach is that its dif culty is greatly in fluenced by the handedness of the surgeon and the location of the lesion. To facilitatecareful dissection so that the lumen of the rectum is not entered, the surgeon ideally keeps his/her nondominant hand in the rectum while using the dominant hand to make the pararectal approach. Thus, if the lesion is located in the left side of the abdominal cavity, as was the case in the study reported here (Durket et al . 2019), a right-handed surgeon may experience dif culty operating unwieldy, long-handled instruments necessary to complete dissection on the left side of the rectum. In the study reported here (Durket et al. 2019), nancial limitations posed by the client appear to be the primary factor driving the selection of the pararectal approach to resolve a lesion constricting the peritoneal portion of the rectum. An approach through colpotomy was also considered, but apparent inability of the surgeon to insert his/her hand into the mare 's vagina eliminated this option. The authors also mention that approaching the lesion through a flank celiotomy was also considered but ultimately not selected, because the cost associated with this procedure was perceived to be higher than the cost incurred using a pararectal approach. We argue, however, that a celiotomy through a flank not only provides access to a larger portion of the abdomen, which in this case turned out to be unnecessary, it also can be performed more quickly than a pararectal approach, and the difference in speed could offset the cost of draping and primary closure associated with the flank approach. Using a modi ed grid technique to approach the abdomen through the flank allows expeditious closure of the celiotomy, which is limited to apposing the external abdominal oblique muscle,subcutaneous tissues and skin. We also contend that a flank celiotomy can be performed cleanly, with the horse standing,without draping the surgical site, provided a large area of the flank is prepared for aseptic surgery. Indeed, we believe that the abdomen can be approached through a nondrapedflank incision at least as cleanly as approaching the abdomen through a nondraped pararectal incision. Releasing the constricting band around the peritoneal portion of the rectum likely could have been accomplishedquicker, with the additional bene t of direct inspection of the lesion, by using laparoscopic technique. By usingreusable laparoscopic equipment available in most referral centres and by foregoing draping, the cost of disposable materials used during the surgery would have been minimal. To make laparoscopic surgery economically feasible for an economically disadvantaged owner, however, the veterinarian or hospital director must be willing to waive the fee assigned to the use of the laparoscope.

Lassaline*\u00a7 Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, University of California, Davis, California;Animal Eye Center of New Jersey, Little Falls, New Jersey; and\u00a7Department of Surgical and Radiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, California, USA while rare in horses, can pose a clinical challenge due to the advanced diagnostic procedures necessary to determine the underlying aetiology and extent of disease. The goal of this study was to explore de nitive causes of exophthalmos within a hospital population andinvestigate prognoses for the various aetiologies. Retrospective medical record review was used to identify 15 horses diagnosed with a de nitive cause of exophthalmos. Patient signalment, disease duration, eye affected, diagnosticprocedures, therapies, and histopathological diagnosis were evaluated. Geldings (12/15, or 80%) were over-represented (P=0.014). Mean age at presentation (14 /C66.7 years) was not signi cantly different for horses with (14 /C68.5 years) and without (15 /C64.4 years) a diagnosis of neoplasia. Diagnosis of a neoplastic process was made in 8/15 horses (53.3%) withneuroendocrine tumour being most common. Eight of the 15 cases were classi ed as primary orbital disease, and seven represented extension from paranasal sinus disease. Two novel diagnoses were identi ed: cystic hamartoma arising from the lacrimal gland and orbital aspergillosis secondary tosinonasal disease. In total, eight of 12 horses for which follow- up was available were euthanised due to orbital disease, two immediately following computed tomography of the skull and six due to disease progression. One horse was euthanised following a peri-anaesthetic complication. Three horses were lost to follow-up. Of the 12 horses for which follow-up was available, only four (33.3%) were alive 21 months post- diagnosis. Considering only patients for whom a de nitive diagnosis was obtained, retrobulbar disease was associatedwith a poor prognosis for life. Introduction Equine retrobulbar disease occurs rarely but can have signi cant impact, potentially affecting vision, use, and survival of the horse (Pucket 2017). Retrobulbar disease inhorses presents a clinical challenge as a de nitive diagnosis (aetiology and location) requires advanced imaging(computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) followed by sampling or surgical techniques, which may be viewed as costly and invasive. Horses may maintain vision or perceived comfort until advanced stages of disease, and this may make veterinarians and owners more inclined to monitor disease progression, making delayed intervention unlikely tobe curative and worsening prognosis for vision and possibly for life.The current literature documenting equine exophthalmos is limited to individual case reports, short case series, and tworeview articles. Thirty-eight cases of primary orbital disease have been described and include 33 cases of neoplasia (Bistner et al. 1983; Sweeney and Beech 1983; Bolton et al. 1990; Van Maanen et al. et al. et al. 1997; Rebhun and Del Piero 1998; Dixon and Head et al. 2008; Miesner et al. 2009; Naylor et al. 2010), four cases of infectious and inflammatory processes (Walde and Prosl 1976; Hubert et al. 1996; Pearce et al. 2001), and one cystic process (Mu ~noz et al. 2007). Twenty cases of orbital disease as an extension of sinonasal disease have been published: 12 with neoplasia(Hill et al. 1989; Dixon and Head 1999; Davis et al. 2002; Scotty et al. 2004; D \u20acopke et al. 2005; Schaaf et al. 2007), ve with infectious/infl ammatory disease (Scott et al. 1974; Roberts et al. 1981; Step et al. 1991; Kanda et al. 2007), two with cystic disease (Barnett et al. 1988; Annear et al. 2008) and one with a haematoma (Kafarnik et al. 2014). It is dif cult to make predictions about prognosis for survival for speci c retrobulbar disease processes in horses when only data from individual cases and small case series are available. The goals of this study were to (1) identify de nitive causes of exophthalmos in horses, (2) determine whether there was an association between age at presentation or disease duration and prognosis for survival in horses with exophthalmos; and (3) identify associations between disease aetiology, treatment and outcome in horses with exophthalmos. Understanding these relationships may help guide predictions about prognosis for disease resolution and for survival, and thereby guide treatment decisions. Method The electronic medical record system at the UC Davis William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital was searched for horses who met three inclusion criteria: (1) having been presented during the years 1988 -2017; (2) having had a clinical diagnosis of exophthalmos made; and(3) having had a de nitive histopathological diagnosis made. Variables extracted from the medical record includedpatient age, sex, breed, duration of disease prior to presentation, as well as which eye was affected, ophthalmic examination ndings, diagnostic technique utilised, therapeutic interventions, and histopathological diagnosis.Outcome was determined either from the medical record in601 of known euthanasia or via communication with the owner via phone or email, and survival time was calculated as the time between presentation and last known follow-up or euthanasia. For each included patient, disease was characterised as being either primary orbital or secondary (extension). Sex distribution and laterality of disease were analysed using binomial distribution, assuming an equal number of males and females and an equal number of right and left eyes in the horse population in general. Descriptive statistics included means and standard deviations for normally distributed interval-scaled data, and medians and ranges for data that are not normally distributed. Differences between means were inferred using a t-test, and differences between medians were inferred using a Mann -Whitney U test. Signi cance was set at P<0.05. All statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism v7.04. Results Population statistics Thirty-one horses met inclusion criteria of being presented between the years of 1988 and 2017 with a clinical diagnosis of exophthalmos, however, only 15 (48.4%) met the third criterion of having a histological diagnosis, and therefore only 15 patients were included. The mean age at presentation was 14 /C66.7 years. There were signi cantly more males (n = 12) than females (n = 3) in the studysample (P =0.014), which was not representative of the general hospital population for the same time period (50.5%geldings, 10.7% stallions, and 38.7% mares). Of the additional 16 cases presented for exophthalmos for which a de nitive histological diagnosis was not reached, 10 (62.5%) weremale, 3 (18.8%) were female, and sex was not listed for three horses. Affected breeds included the Quarter Horse (4), Thoroughbred (3), American Paint Horse (2), and one each of Appaloosa, Morgan Horse, Warmblood, Rocky Mountain Horse, Shetland Pony and Welsh Pony breeds. The breed distribution for the study population was similar to that of the general hospital population. Duration of clinical signs prior to presentation was reported for 12 horses, for which the median was 90 days (range 3 -1080 days). The right globe was affected in nine horses, and the left globe wasaffected in six horses (P =0.15). Visual status of the affected globe was reported for 11 cases. Five globes wereevaluated as being visual, one had decreased vision and ve were non-visual. Diagnostic procedures and histological diagnoses All but one of the horses underwent at least one modality of diagnostic imaging, with many undergoing multiple modalities. Skull radiographs were performed in nine cases, orbital ultrasonography was performed in nine cases, and computed tomography was performed in ve cases. Other commonly performed diagnostic procedures included complete bloodcount (12 horses), and oral examination accompanied by nasal or paranasal sinus endoscopy ( ve horses). Orbital disease was classi ed as primary in eight horses and secondary to sinonasal disease in seven horses. Aetiologies of primary orbital disease included neoplasia (n = 5), in flammation (n = 1), cyst (n = 1) and foreign material (n = 1). Tumour types identi ed included neuroendocrine tumour (n = 3), haemangiosarcoma (n = 1) and squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1). Extraocular muscle myopathy (n = 1),cystic glandular hamartoma (n = 1) and wooden foreignmaterial (n = 1) comprised the non-neoplastic diagnoses. Aetiologies of the seven cases of secondary orbital disease, which in each case was an extension of paranasal sinus disease, included neoplasia (n = 3), infection/infl ammation (n = 2) and cyst (n = 2). Tumour types included lymphosarcoma(n = 1), spindle cell sarcoma (n = 1), and undifferentiated carcinoma (n = 1). Aspergillus granulomas were diagnosed in two horses (one case of Aspergillus fumigatus was diagnosed via polymerase chain reaction and one case of Aspergillus (Emericella) nidulans was diagnosed via fungal culture), and paranasal sinus cysts were diagnosed in two horses. The mean age of presentation for horses diagnosed with neoplasia (14 /C68.5) and for horses with non-neoplastic diagnoses (15 /C64.4) were not signi cantly different (P=0.077). Therapies and outcomes Eleven of the 15 cases were approached surgically. Four horses underwent exenteration, four underwent sinusotomy, and one underwent a globe-sparing mass excision via the supraorbital fossa. Foreign body removal and molar extractions were performed in one horse each. Follow-up information was available for 12 horses. The horse diagnosed with a cystic glandular hamartoma underwent globe-sparing mass excision (Figs 1 and 2) and was alive with a visual and apparently comfortable affected globe 12 years post-operatively. Onehorse diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour was alive without clinical evidence of regrowth or metastasis 21 months post-exenteration. The horse diagnosed with extraocular myopathy was euthanised 11 years post-exenteration due to colic and showed no evidence of recurrence of orbital disease. The horse diagnosed with haemangiosarcoma was euthanised following luxation of the carpus during recovery from anaesthesia. Two horses were euthanised while anaesthetised for computed tomographic scanning which revealed inoperable disease due to invasion of the calvaria. The histological diagnosis for one horse was neuroendocrine tumour and for the other horse was Aspergillus granuloma. The remaining six horses were euthanised at varying time points dueto progression of disease. The horses diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma and spindle cell carcinoma were euthanised within 1 week of diagnosis. The horse diagnosed with an undifferentiated sinonasal carcinoma was euthanised 1 month post-clinical diagnosis of exophthalmos and de nitive diagnosis was made on necropsy. The second case of paranasal sinusaspergillosis with orbital extension was euthanised 6 months following histological diagnosis which was obtained via sinusotomy. One horse diagnosed with a paranasal sinus cyst was euthanised 7 years post-diagnosis due to extrusion of an implant which was placed following sinusotomy to aid in closure of the deformed frontal bone. Follow-up was unavailable for the horse diagnosed with lymphosarcoma, and the remaining horsesdiagnosed with paranasal sinus cyst (n = 1), and neuroendocrine tumour (n = 1). Of the 12 horses for which follow-up was available, only four (33.3%; one neoplastic, three non-neoplastic) survived to 21 months post-diagnosis. Summaries of the included cases are provided in Tables 1 and 2.

The cases of the present study were divided nearly evenly between primary orbital (8/15) and secondary to paranasal sinus disease (7/15), con rming the need for a thorough diagnostic evaluation of the entire skull withparticular attention to the paranasal sinuses when evaluating horses with exophthalmos. Neoplasia comprised over half of the diagnoses, with the most prevalent tumour type in this population being a neuroendocrine tumour. This supports previous documentation of this tumour type as a common primary orbital neoplasm in the horse (Matiasek et al. 2007; Pucket 2017). This tumour can be invasive and result in bony destruction through thecalvarium. Metastasis has been reported in only one case, with neoplastic tissue identi ed in the lung in addition to the orbit (Basher et al. 1997). The duration of exophthalmos prior to presentation for the horses of this study with neuroendocrine tumours treated by exenteration was 3 and 9 months, and for the case that was euthanised was 16 months, suggesting that delay in diagnosis and therapy worsens prognosis for life. Previous reports suggest that if surgical intervention via exenteration is implemented, recurrence is unlikely and overall prognosis may be good(Miesner et al. 2009). For cases in which osteolysis consistent with bony invasion is present, excisional surgery is unlikely to change survival time of the horse, and thus may not be indicated. However, in the presence of refractory exposure keratitis, enucleation may be required to provide comfort and prevent progression of disease to globe rupture. Expulsive haemorrhage has been reported as a complication of exenteration as treatment of orbital neuroendocrine tumours (Miesner et al. 2009), and it was also the clinical impression of the surgeons of the cases presented in thisstudy that there was signi cant blood loss, although no complications associated with systemic hypotension orhypoperfusion were observed. For the neoplastic diagnoses other than neuroendocrine tumour, survival time, even with treatment was less than 1 month from diagnosis. Two novel aetiologies of equine orbital disease are reported here and include one case of a cystic hamartoma of lacrimal gland origin and two cases of orbital aspergillosis as an extension of paranasal sinus infection. There are three previous reports of cystic disease-causing exophthalmos in horses which include a primary orbital dermoid cyst, and secondary extension of hydatid and paranasal sinus cysts to the orbit (Barnett et al. 1988; Mu ~noz et al. 2007; Annear et al. 2008). The National Cancer Institute de nes hamartoma as a benign growth made up of an abnormal mixture of cells and tissues normally found in the area of the body where the growth occurs. As these are thought to be developmental lesions, the slowly progressive nature of this mass was attributed to enlargement of the cyst over time due to continued secretions, rather than growth of the disorganised tissue. The affected horse remained alive and visual 12 years post-cyst excision, and this informationcombined with the good outcome of the horse diagnosed with a primary orbital dermoid cyst (Mu ~noz et al. 2007)TABLE 2: Signalment, clinical ndings, therapy, diagnosis, and outcome for horses with orbital disease secondary to sinonasal disease Diagnosis DurationAge (years) Sex BreedAffectedeyeVisualstatus Imaging Therapy Outcome Case 1 Undifferentiated carcinomaNA 9 F Thoroughbred OD Blind Skull cisplatinEuthanised (1 month) Case 2 Lymphosarcoma <15 months 27 G Thoroughbred OS NA Skull radiographs Molar extractions NA Case 3 Spindle cell sarcoma 4 weeks 6 G Appaloosa OD NA Skull Euthanised (3 days) Aspergillus fumigatus >2 weeks 15 G Paint OD Blind Orbital US, skull CT None Euthanised at diagnosis Case 5 Aspergillus nidulans 6 months 12 F Shetland Pony OS Visual Skull radiographs, orbital USSinusotomy Euthanised (6 months) Case 6 Paranasal sinus cyst 3 years 14 G Quarter Horse OS NA Skull radiographs, skull CTSinusotomy, facial reconstructionEuthanised (7 years) Case 7 Paranasal sinus cyst 2 weeks 15 F Morgan right eye; OS, left eye; US, ultrasound.

Only two cases ofequine sinonasal fungal disease with orbital involvement are available inthe literature. One horse was euthanised upon diagnosis ofcryptococcosis via cytology of a nasal swab and biopsy via the frontal sinus (Scott etal.1974). A second case of orbital cryptococcosis had initial nasal signs with no orbital involvement and survived 26 months, atwhich time the horse was euthanised and early orbital involvement was diagnosed onnecropsy (Roberts etal.1981). Together, these cases suggest that mycotic sinonasal disease that hasextended toinvolve theorbit carries apoor prognosis for survival in the horse. That the majority ofcases (11/15) inthis report were treated surgically was adirect reflection ofthe inclusio n criterion of adenitive histological diagnosis, which necessitated either surgical biopsy ornecropsy, and thus selected forcases that underwent asurgical diagnosis inthe ofthe aims was tocorrelate diagnosis with treatment modality and outcome.

VUE /C19alez-Medina Comparative Neuromuscular Laboratory, Royal Veterinary UK Corresponding author email: sgonzalezmedina@rvc.ac.uk Summary Eosinophilic keratitis (EK) is considered an immune mediated disorder associated with an underlying type I or IV hypersensitivity reaction to parasitic or environment allergens. It is believed that the persistency of infl ammatory mediators and recruitment of eosinophils into the conjunctival tissuehave detrimental effects on the corneal surface. Epithelial cells are consequently damaged, particularly by eosinophilic toxic proteins, which determine the lack of epithelial healing and plaque formation. Although some clinical signs are common to other corneal diseases, the location of the lesion, presence of corneal plaques and time of the year, may help practitioners to identify EK. Topical therapy with steroids or immune-modulators seems to be the most effective treatment in small, localised lesions while large epithelial defects will bene t from a thorough debridement and/or early keratectomy, before microbial infection mayoccur. Introduction Eosinophilic keratitis (EK) and/or keratoconjuctivitis was rst documented in horses as such in 1994 in the USA (Ramsey et al. 1994). However, earlier reports of ocular onchocerciasis in the 1970s might refer to the same condition (Schmidt et al. 1982 ;Munger 1983) although the presence of micro lariae in cytological samples is an inconsistent nding nowadays. EK is considered an immune mediated disorder associated with an underlying type I or IV hypersensitivity reaction to parasitic or environment allergens (Brooks 2004; Utter et al. 2013). The complex immunological network established betweenconjunctiva and cornea seems to play a central role in perpetuation and exacerbation of the in flammatory process with sometimes catastrophic consequences for corneal tissue(Solomon et al. 2004). Perhaps EK should be considered an ocular syndrome rather than a true disease, as it is possiblethat several aetiological factors might contribute to eosinophil migration in this tissue. Eosinophilic keratitis has been described in several animal species (Chisholm 1989; Yamagata et al. 1996; Geyer and Raymond-Letro 2009; Grinninger et al. 2012), but extensively studied in humans and cats. Feline eosinophilic keratitis does not have age, breed orsex predilection, although it has been reported most frequently in young castrated males (Paulsen et al. 1987 ; Morgan et al. 1996) and no seasonal occurrence seems to exist. Initial presentation, in the majority of cases, is unilateral although it eventually becomes bilateral (Paulsen et al. 1987 ; Morgan et al. 1996; Dean and Meunier 2013) and the potential link with feline herpesvirus remains unclear (Nasisse et al. 1998; Townsend et al. 2004; Stiles Dean and Meunier 2013). In humans, vernal keratoconjunctivitis has a gender and age predisposition, with young males most commonly affected (Bonini et al. 2000). Prevalence is higher in dry hot climates with markedseasonal presentation (Leonardi 2002; Kumar 2009). One third of affected patients have concurrently multiple atopic diseases, with asthma being the most common (Tuft et al. 1998; Bonini et al. 2000). In horses, the disease has been increasingly recognised in the last 10 years, with several studies looking into clinical presentation, treatment response and epidemiological factors (Utter et al. 2014; Edwards et al. 2015; Gonzalez-Medina et al. , unpublished data). There is no sex, breed or age predisposition, although in the latest case series by Edwards et al. (2015), mares were most frequently affected. A clear seasonal component is present in horses,with summer being the most prevalent (Utter et al. 2014; Edwards et al. 2015). Urticaria was anecdotally described in three horses but the link with EK in those cases remains unclear (Utter et al. 2014). Generally, affected horses are in good health, correctly vaccinated, wormed and they havefollowed an appropriate diet when the diagnosis was made (Utter et al. 2014; Edwards et al. 2015) ( Fig 1 ). Eosinophils and immunity: insights on EK pathophysiology Eosinophils comprise about 1 -6% of the total white blood cells pool and they are easy to recognise in cytological and histological samples for their ne and pink granulated cytoplasm. They reside naturally in the brain, bowel, femalereproductive system and lymphoid tissue and they are considered pathologic when found in other tissues (Davoine and Lacy 2014). Eosinophils develop from myeloid precursor cells located in the bone marrow under TH2 cytokines in fluence, particularly IL-5 (Mould et al. 1997). They have a limited life span in the circulation around 8 -18 h, which is extended to 3 -4 days in tissues (Davoine and Lacy 2014). Similar to neutrophils, they areterminally end-differentiated cells programmed to undergo apoptosis after cessation of triggering stimuli. Its persistence in the tissues is enhanced by the presence of cytokines that prolong eosinophil survival by inhibiting apoptosis (Walsh 2013). The understanding of the immunological role of these eosinophils has continuously evolved in the past decades, from primarily a homeostatic role in the defence against helminth parasitic infections to an effective modulator of type I hypersensitivity reactions (allergy). Currently, emerging roles incancer and antiviral host defence immunomodulation highlight the complexity of the biological contribution of eosinophils to the immune response (Jacobsen et al. 2012; Davoine and Lacy 2014). \u00a92018 10.1111/eve.12937Eosinophils produce and intargeted tissues different toxic substances and effectors such asgranule proteins, enzymes, reactive oxygen species, and eicosanoids. Among them, eosinophil major basic protein, eosinophilic cationic protein and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9) are Trocme etal.1993; Kumagai etal.2000). cytotoxicity onthe corneal surface (Trocme etal.1993; Trocme and Aldave 1994) while the latter basement medicine where conjunctival inflammation seems toplay apivotal role in subsequent corneal injury (Fukuda and Nishida 2010; Solomon etal.2004). Mast cells are the key cellular compon ent for initiating the inflammatory cascade inthe conjunctiva facilitating the thecorneal surface toeosinophilic proteins, which damage corneal epithelium (Leonardi 2002). The persistence of eosinophil major basic protein on the corneal surface seemstoexacerbate tissue destruction byreleasing chemokines and further activating neutrophils, which adversely interfere ofregenerating corneal epithelial cells ofthis protein over sometimes reaching the epithelial basement membrane, isknown toprompt the formation of dense plaques that will feedback and encourage the release of more inflammatory mediators, hence perpetuating the corneal damage.

(2015) tried to correlate climatological conditions, such as solar radiation and humidity, with thedevelopment ofEKwithout success.

Likewise, the evidence oncogene E5 transcript were identi affected by EK (Kainzbauer etal.2008), butitsreal linkwith thecondition remains unclear. The use tools in laboratory diagnosis mayhelp tounravel theaetiology ofmany idiopathic conditions but the results should be interpreted with care ( Fig2). Clinical signs The clinical signs displayed depend onthe stage ofthe disease and perhaps the trigger factor. Main clinical signs include blepharospasm, epiphora, conjunctival hyperaemia and yellow discharge, yellow/whitish inltrative cytologically negatives tomigrate into stroma layers inchronic from where they keep releasing chemotox icmolecules that prevent epithelial healing. These cases can bechallenging to diagnose bycytology, and almost inevitably necessitate keratectomy forhistological rmation. Clinical signs and the presence ofeosinophils incorneal scrapes therefore, support diagnosis of the condition (Fig3).Lack of standardised diagnostic criteria has been suggested tobe detrimental forearly diagnosis and successful treatment in humans (Kumar 2009). Clinical grading seems tobeofhelp for physicians when treating the condition inhuman patients (Cameron 1995; Bonini etal.2000) but ithas received little interest inveterinary medicine.

In some cases, asmall, white/cream plaque that quickly detaches from thecorneal bed can beseen. Progressive extensive (Fig5):Characterised bymarked ocular pain with extensive lesions that progress rapidly axially, generally from the periphery towards the central cornea. These lesions aremore likely toform corneal plaques and get complicated with microbial infections, perhaps due tothe extension ofthe epithelial impairment. Involvement ofthe stromal layers ispossible and should be considered in refractory cases. Additionally, another form presented infrequently isthe super cial multifocal (Fig6),inwhich multiple caseous foci are spread over the corneal surface, although with preference forperilimbar locations. Corneal oedema usually occurs from moderate tosevere. Disparity intissue response due toeosinophilic presence has been previously reported, however, the mechanisms behind are unknown (Dixon etal. 2006; Walsh 2013). Differences ineosinophil recruitment are most likely linked todifferent concentrations ofeosinophil granule major basic protein; high concentrations inhibit both epithelial migration and protein synthesis, whereas lowconcentrations might only affect epithelial migration (Trocme etal.1993). Treatment options Effective treatment isstilldebatable inhorses due tothelack ofrmevidence, and usually relies onpersonal oftheclinician. Topical steroids seem tobe bene intheearly stages despite corneal ulceration, but super keratectomy to remove plaques and/or inflammatory debris isknown toobtain the best results in terms ofshorter recovery period, only inhorses (Yamagata ofeosinophil protein lodged inthe ulcer, which has amajor impact inulcer healing. Additionally ,diamond burr debridement has also been suggested toenhance epithelial healing inhorses with refractory healing ulcers (Utter etal.2014) and itcould bea less invasive option forshallow ulcers. Generally, topical immunosupresive therapy, either corticosteroids (Utter etal.2013; Edwards etal.2015). Topical steroids arenaturally themost effective toaseptic ulcers and carefully monitored. Ocular preparations that contain both, asteroid and broad antibiotic, may beasafer option iftheveterinarian and horses (Graztek Matthews and 2009). Some drugs, such as ketorolac, diclophen ac or indomethacin, demonstrated positive effects inreducing itching 2003). However, they have enhance eosinophilic disease inthe horse (McEwan 1990; Fig6:Multifocal region and conjunctival hyperaemia (Image courtesy ofthe Animal Health Trust. This gure also included in (Images thanks toreferring veterinarian Mr.A.McGladdery (A). \u00a92018 EVJLtd613 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2019Brooks et al. 2016). Mast cell stabilisers, which have an antieosinophilic effect, such as NAAGA and Iodoxamine, help to control the progression of clinical signs and relieve symptomatology in humans at an early stage, but they have been used unfrequently in veterinary medicine. Some oral medications seem to improve clinical signs and/or re-occurrence. Aspirin is consistently reported in the literature as the most effective NSAIDs treatment in humans (Abelson et al. 1983; Chaudhary 1990). Megestrol acetate is known to effectively control eosinophilic keratitis in cats,although it is only used in refractory cases due to its numerous side effects (Paulsen et al. 1987; Plumb 2008; Spiess et al. 2009). In horses, a short course of systemic steroids seemed to shorten resolution time in one study (Utter et al. 2013), however, this was still lengthy (average 2 months), andthe variable dosing regimen precludes establishment of a therapetical protocol at the moment. Ceterizine is an H1- receptor antagonist that reduces tissue in ltration with eosinophils, but had little effect in severely affected patients(Leonardi 2002). Despite good bioavailability after oral administration in horses (Olsen et al. 2007), this medication failed to reduce the signs associated with insect-bitehypersensitivity in one study (Olsen et al. 2011) but Utter et al. (2013) showed that this drug reduced signi cantly the re- occurrence of eosinophilic keratitis in horses although it did not shorten recovery time. In human medicine, treatment choice depends on clinical grading of the lesion (Cameron 1995; Lin et al. 2013). For ulcers with a transparent base medical treatment allows rapid re-epithelialisation. In contrast, more advanced lesions bene t from an early keratectomy. The downside of keratectomy is the corneal defect created that wouldrequire topical therapy for several days/weeks, depending on lesion size, in order to avoid microbial infections. Nevertheless, healing time usually ranges from 1 week to 10 days post surgery. Amniotic grafting is recommended in large corneal defects and/or those that involve the resection of epithelial basement membrane. This grafting will serve as a basement membrane, facilitating migration of epithelial cells and promoting adhesion of basal cells (Lee and Tseng 1997; Lin et al. 2013). In the author 's experience topical therapy is most effective in the previously called \"localised-nonprogressive \" clinical presentation, particularly topical steroids and/or cyclosporine administered as ointment. Super cial debridement of the ulcer 's bed prior to initiating topical therapy can also reduce signi cantly the resolution time. The debridement can be performed either with the blunt end ofa scalpel or more effectively with a diamond blur device. Reoccurrence and sequelae Reoccurrence is relatively frequent in horses, with around 33% affected horses presenting a further episode within a year (Utter et al. 2013). However, it is dif cult to know if those numbers are re flecting an incomplete resolution rather than a true reoccurrence. Likewise in humans (Saboo et al. 2013; Reddy et al. 2013), the most common sequelae is mild to moderate scarring (Ramsey et al. 1994; Utter et al. 2013). Pigmentation/melanosis is frequently present during healing and it can be prominent for therst couple of months, regressing steadily afterwards. Rarely the lesions remains pigmented for longer than 6 months(Fig 7 ).Conclusion Eosinophilic keratitis has become relatively common in horses, particularly in the summer months. Practitioners should consider it when raised plaques or deposits are present on the cornea as well as in chronic nonhealing ulcers. Treatment with topical medication can be lengthy but successful; however, super cial keratectomy should be discussed with horse owners early on the course of thedisease.

April 28, 2014. Dechra Veterinary Products US and the Dechra D logo are registered trademarks of Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC. \u00a9 2019 Dechra Ltd.CAUTION: Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of licensed veterinarian. FOR EVERY EQUINE DISCIPLINE OSPHOS\u00ae (clodronate injection) Manufactured for: Dechra Veterinary 66211 866-933-2472 \u00a9 2019 Dechra Ltd. OSPHOS is a registered trademark of Dechra Ltd. All rights reserved. Approved by FDA under NADA # 141-427As with all drugs, side effects may occur. In field studies and post-approval experience the most common side effects reported were signs of discomfort, nervousness, and colic. Other signs reported were: renal insufficiency/failure, anorexia, lethargy, hypercalcemia, behavioral disorders, hyperkalemia, hyperthermia, injection site reactions, muscle tremor, urticaria, hyperglycemia, and fracture. In some cases, death has been reported as an outcome of these adverse events. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in horses less than 4 years of age or breeding horses. OSPHOS should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. NSAIDs should not be used concurrently with OSPHOS. Concurrent use of NSAIDs with OSPHOS may increase the risk of renal toxicity and acute renal failure. Use of OSPHOS in patients with conditions affecting renal function or mineral or electrolyte homeostasis is not recommended. Refer to the prescribing information for complete details or visit www.dechra-us.com.Learn more online www.dechra-us.com www.osphos.com The intramuscular bisphosphonate injection for control of clinical signs associated with Navicular Syndrome in horses 4 years of age and older Bisphosphonate. For use in horses only. Brief Summary (For Full Prescribing Information, see package insert) CAUTION: Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. DESCRIPTION: Clodronate disodium is (dichloromethylene) salt and is manufactured from the tetrahydrate form. INDICATION: For the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Horses with hypersensitivity to clodronate disodium should not receive OSPHOS. Do not use in horses with impaired renal function or with a history of renal disease.WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. HUMAN WARNINGS: Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of accidental human exposure.PRECAUTIONS: OSPHOS has been associated with renal toxicity. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be monitored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Horses should be well-hydrated prior to and after the administration of OSPHOS due to the potential for adverse renal events. Water intake and urine output should be monitored for 3-5 days post-treatment and any changes from baseline should elicit further evaluation. As a class, bisphosphonates may be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Sensitivity to drug associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Renal and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may be associated with plasma concentrations of the drug. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal impairment may increase plasma bisphos - phonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be monitored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Administration of bisphosphonates has been associated with abdominal pain (colic), discomfort, and agitation in horses. Clinical signs usually occur shortly after drug administration and may be associated with alterations in intestinal motility. In horses treated with OSPHOS these clinical signs usually began within 2 hours of treatment. Horses should be monitored for at least 2 hours following administration of OSPHOS. Bisphosphonates affect plasma concentrations of some minerals and electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, immediately post-treatment, with effects lasting up to several hours. Caution should be used when administering bisphosphonates to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, hypocalcemia, etc.). The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in horses less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in breeding horses or pregnant or lactating mares. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of months to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the total dose and duration of bisphospho - nate use. Bisphosphonates have been shown to cause fetal developmental abnormalities in laboratory animals. The uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone may be greater than into maternal bone creating a possible risk for skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus. Many drugs, including bisphosphonates, may be excreted in milk and may be absorbed by nursing animals. Increased bone fragility has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphona tes at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphos - phonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair micro damage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; however, a causal relationship has not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions reported in the field study were clinical signs of discomfort or ner - vousness, colic and/or pawing. Other signs reported were lip licking, yawning, head shaking, injection site swelling, and hives/pruritus. POST-APPROVAL EXPERIENCE (December 2018): The following adverse events are based on post-approval adverse drug experience reporting. Not all adverse events are reported to FDA/ CVM. It is not always possible to reliably estimate the adverse event frequency or establish a causal relationship to product exposure using these data. The following adverse events are listed in decreasing order of reporting frequency: renal failure, polyuria, polydipsia, abdominal pain, anorexia, lethargy, hypercalcemia, behavioral disorder, discomfort, hyperkalemia, hyperactivity, recumbency, hyperthermia, injection site reactions, muscle tremor, urticaria, hyperglycemia, and fracture. In some cases, death has been reported as an outcome of the adverse events listed above. INFORMATION FOR HORSE OWNERS: Owners should be advised to: NOT administer NSAIDs. Ensure horses have access to adequate water before and after administration of OSPHOS. Observe their horse for at least 2 hours post-treatment for signs of colic, agitation, and/or abnormal behavior. If a horse appears uncomfortable, nervous, or experiences cramping post-treatment, hand walk the horse for 15 minutes. If signs do not resolve contact the veterinarian. Monitor water intake and urine output for 3-5 days post- treatment. Contact their veterinarian if the horse displays abnormal clinical signs such as changes in drinking and urination, appetite, and attitude.Visit us at Booth 1517 for policy quotes, health screenings, and more!
