INTRODUCTION 1. In the context of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of livi ng, and on the right to non- discrimination in this context, receives a large number of communications alle ging violations of the right to adequate housing and related rights worldwide. Such comm unications are received from national, regional and international non-governmental organizations , as well as intergovernmental organizations and other United Nations procedures concer ned with the protection of human rights. 2. The present addendum to the annual report of the Special Rappor teur contains, on a country-by-country basis, summaries of commun ications sent by the Special Rapporteur to States, responses received from States, observa tions of the Special Rapporteur, and follow-up communications and activities relating to earlier communications, from the period of 5 December 2007 to 5 December 2008 and replies received for the period of 24 January 2008 to 6 February 2009. A number of th e communications contained in th e present report were sent by the former Special Rapporteur, Mr. Miloon Kothari. 3. Where appropriate, the Special Ra pporteur has sent joint urgent appeals or letters with one or more special procedures of the Human Right s Council where the allega tions raised concerned the right to adequate housi ng as well as rights addr essed under other mandates. 4. During the period under review, the Sp ecial Rapporteur sent a total of 34 communications concerning the right to adequate housing to 25 States. Of these 34 communications transmitted, 17 replies were received from Governments . 5. The Special Rapporteur apprec iates and thanks the concerne d States for these replies. However, she regrets that several Governments ha ve failed to respond, or when they have, have done so in a selective manner that does not re spond to all the questions arising from the communication. These communications remain outstanding and the Special Rapporteur encourages Governments to respond to every co mmunication, and all concer ns raised in each communication. 6. A large number of the communi cations in the period under revi ew are related to cases of forced evictions. Forced evictions constitute prima facie violations of a wide range of internationally recognized human rights and la rge-scale evictions can only be carried out under exceptional circumstances and in full accordance with international human rights law. The Special Rapporteur notes that in the majority of cases, state authorities carrying out evictions appear completely unaware of th e state's human rights obligations , in particular the need for assessing the impact of evictions on individual and communities, the need to consider eviction only as a last resort after having envisaged al l other options, meaningful consultation with affected communities, adequate prior notification, adequate relocation and compensation. The Special Rapporteur reminds all states that eviction should never result in rendering people homeless and putting them in a vul nerable situation. In this c ontext, the Special Rapporteur A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 4 reminds all Governments of the Basic principles and guidelines on develo pment-based evictions and displacement that can be used as a tool to prevent human rights violations in cases where evictions are unavoidable.1 7. The Special Rapporteur notes w ith concern the reports that th e mandate continue to receive in regards to threats, harassment, and imprisonment of human rights defenders, community representatives and acti vists working on the right to adequate housing. 8. The Special Rapporteur believes in the importa nce of engaging in a constructive dialogue with States aimed at implementing and r ealizing the right to adequate housing. The communications sent by the Special Rapporteur have to be understood in this context. In a spirit of cooperation, the Special Rapporte ur urges all States and other actors to respond promptly to the communications, to immediately take appropriate measures, to investigate alle gations of the violation of the right to adequa te housing and related rights and to take all steps necessary to redress the situation. 9. To the extent that resources available to the mandate permit, the Special Rapporteur continues to follow up on communications sent and monitor the situa tion where no reply has been received, where the reply received was not considered satisfactory or where questions remain outstanding. The Special Ra pporteur also invites the sour ces that have reported the alleged cases of violations, to review cases and responses included in this report, and send, when appropriate, follow-up information for further consideration of the cases. II. SUMMARY OF COMMUNICATIONS SENT TO GOVERNMENTS AND REPLIES RECEIVED Argentina Seguimiento 10. El 31 del enero de 2008, el Relator en conjunto por el Gobierno de Argentina el 4 de julio de 2007 en respuesta a la comunicaci\u00f3n conjunta de 27 de marzo de familias diaguitas en marzo de 2007, en el marco de la legislaci\u00f3n argentina y de los est\u00e1ndares internacionales en este sentido, solicitar on al Gobierno cualquier 1 The Basic principles and guide lines on development-based evictions and displacement are contained in report A/HRC/4/18. See also the Speci al Rapporteur's web page on de i\u00f3n conjunta 2007. fecha 31 de enero de 2008. Bangladesh Communication sent 12. On 27 December 2007, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food and the Special Rapporteur on th e situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people sent a joint allegation letter to th e Government of Bangladesh to inquire about reports alleging forced evictions and illegal land seiz ures in the Sadhana Tila area and other Jumma indigenous communities in Chittagong Hill Tracks. According to the information the Special Rapporteur received, in August 2007, Bangladesh army personnel, led by the Dighinala Army Zone Commander, Majo r Kamrul Hassan, ordered the area, in Dighinala Upazilla, Kh agrachari Hill District, an area compromising approximately 300 acres of land that houses a Buddhist Meditation Center and Jumma indigenous village, with the objective of allowing for the settlement of 800 non-indigenous settler families. The settlement plan of Sadhana Tila allegedly involved hi gh-ranking officials of the Bangladeshi Army, which have reportedly put pressure on the Baghaichari Mouza No. 50, on the Union Council Chairman, and other local elders to agree to the settleme nt plan. As the local Jumma community refused to comply with the eviction order, the military have reportedly forced the gradual removal of the Jumma community from their traditional lands. In the meantime, military trucks and jeeps have reportedly transported settler families into Sadhana Tila. These settlers have reportedly started to clear the j ungle around the Buddhist temple and to build their houses under the protection and command of the Army and of the police personnel. The Army personnel have reportedly been actively involved in the clea ring of jungle areas around the Kamala Bagan School, near Sadhana Tila Buddhist temple. The army personnel have reportedly announced an incentive grant of Taka 50,000 for each settler family who will be willing to settle in the area, in addition to Taka 1,000 as mont hly allowance. The army personnel have also reportedly threatened to cut free food rations to those settlers who do not want to settle in Sadhana Tila area. In the meantime, the local administrator of Dighina la has been allegedly asked to provide forged land documents to the se ttlers. It was reported that the case of the Sadhana Tila area is part of a wider trend of ill egal occupation of the Jumma's traditional lands in the Chittagong Hill Tracks in Bangladesh since the Caretaker Government declared the State of Emergency in January 1997. These cases have re portedly led in many instances to the forced eviction of Jumma families, with the active suppo rt of members of the security forces. The special Rapporteur has received information about different cases in a recent period, including the following: In March 2007, more than 400 Mro indigenous families were order to their ancestral lands in the vicinities of th e forcefully evicted from th eir traditional lands in the vicinities of the Ruma military cantonmen t, in 6 district. This eviction followed the repor ted irregular purchase of 7,570 acres of land belonging to the Mro community from the m ilitary, in which neither the Mro leaders nor the affected communities were reportedly consulted. In May 2007, about one hundred settlers re portedly took possessi on of a total of 37 acres of hilly land belonging to nine Ju mma families in the village of Betchari, Rengkarjya Mouza, Merung District. It is reported that Chongrachari army camp commander Subedar Siraj provided protection to the settlers, w ho have already built their houses on the occupied land. In June 2007, 12 Jumma families were reportedly evicted by the Military from their traditional lands in Dhankupya village, in Kh agrachari district, in order to give ground to the settlement of at least 200 non-indigenous families. In early July 2007, a total of 200 allegedly i llegal settler families occupied the lands belonging to the local Jumma villagers in East Gamaridhala, Dadkuppya Mouza (No. 259), Khagrachari District. The setteler s were allegedly brought from different parts of the district including village. According to the reports, the army personnel directly pl anned and implemented the settlement. On 19 July 2007, Betchari Sub-zone Commander Major Kamrul Hassan reported called for an unsolicited arbitration between Jumma communities and irregular settlers in his military camp in Bara Merung, Dighinala Upazi la, Khagrachari District. As a result of his verbal judgment, 5.2 acres of land trad itionally belonging to three Jumma villagers, but which were not officially recorded, were given way to other three settler families. In an operation lasting from 1 to 15 August 2007, a large number of settlers reportedly occupied 300 acres of hilly land belongi ng to 17 Jumma families Dighinala Thana, Khagracahri Dist rict, under the alleged protection of the Military. Approximately 85 non-indigenous familie s have reportedly settled in the area, and have now cleared the jungle of the occupied lands and are in process is on to construct houses. According to the reports, the Military inte nds to settle a total of 200 families. According to the information received, in another recent case of land-grabbing, illegal settlers have reportedly taken over 59 acres of land belonging to 17 Jumma indigenous people in Kobakhali mouza, under Dighinala po lice station, in Khag racahari district. Moreover, in an operation lasting from 1st to 15th August 2007, larg e groups of settlers led by former Union Parishad (UP) memb er Mohammed Abu Taleb of Hashinchonpur village and former UP member Mohammed Ka der of Kobakhali baza r took control of the hilly lands belonging to Chakma people w ith the direct assist ance of the army, the paramilitary forces and the local Village Defence Party (VDP) members. Due to the presence of the Bangladesh security forces , which provided protection to the illegal setters, the Jummas could not offer any resi stance. Presently, works for construction of houses in the lands seized from the indi genous peoples are reportedly underway. The army has reportedly planned to settle 200 plain settlers' families in Kobakhali Mouza. A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 7 In September 2007, an estimated 250 acres of titled lands belonging to Jumma people in North and South Shantipur, Sutokorma and Manikkya villages, Choto Panchari Mouza Latiban Union of Panchari Th ana, Khagrachari district, have been illegally occupied by no n-indigenous settlers. 13. It was reported that all th ese actions may be in violati on of article 26 (1) of the 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracks Accord provides that \"[n] otwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time-being in force, no land within the boundaries of Hill District shall be given in settlement, purchased, sold and transferred includ ing giving lease without prior approval of the [Chittagong Hill Tracks] Council.\" In addition, it was reported that in those cases in which the Jumma villages lack a title deed over their traditi onal lands, the authorities consider them to be State land, freely disposing of it to facilitate the sett lement of non-indigen ous settlers. Concern was expressed that these cases may be part of a systematic campaign to support the settlement of non-indigenous families in the Chittagong Hill Track s, with the active sup port of the security forces, with an ultimate view to outnumber the local Jumma indigenous community in the region. 14. On 3 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur togeth er with the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food and Special Rapporteur on the situati on of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people sent a joint alle gation letter to the Government of Bangladesh to inquire about reports concerning the alleged illegal seizure of the traditional lands of Jumma indigenous communities in Barbadan, Khagrachari and Merung districts, in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Between March 2007 and the date of this commun ication, an estimated 4,500 acres of land have been reportedly taken away from Jumma indivi dual and communities in at least 16 villages or commons belonging to five Unions (Dighinala, Kiang-ghat, Kamalchari, Khagrachari No.1, and Maischari,) in Kagrachari district. The names of the villages in which these episodes have reportedly taken place are the following: 1. Sadhana Tila Budhist Temple, Dighinala 16. South Joysen Para Community Primary School, Maischari Union 15. The mandate holders indicated that similar patt erns seem to have taken in other districts. By way of illustration, in May 2007, about one hundred settlers reportedly took possession of a total of 37 acres of hilly land be longing to nine Jumma families in the village of Betchari, Rengkarjya Mouza, Merung District. In the Barbadan district, more than 400 Mro indigenous families were reportedly forcefully evicted from their traditional lands in the vicinities of the Ruma military cantonment, in Ruma Upazila Parishad, in March 2007, following the alleged irregular purchase of 7,570 acres of land. It is reported that the G overnment is currently in the process of acquiring 9,560 acres of land for furthe r expansion of the Garrison. According to the allegations, these lands have been illegally a nd forcibly grabbed by Bengali settlers from different cluster villages gather ed around army camps. It is reported that army personnel were directly involved in a ll these cases, creating a climate of fear among the local Jumma villagers and instigating the settlers to se ize their lands. In other cases, army personnel have reportedly given grants to settler family willing to build their houses in the area. In other cases, army personnel have been allegedly been directly involved in the planning and implementation of the settlement. It is also reported that army pers onnel have actively assisted the settlers in the construction of houses in the allegedly seized lands. Finally, in other instances, local administrators have been reportedly asked to pr ovide forged land documents to the settlers. In many of the reported cases of eviction, the indige nous families have been forced to leave their homesteads, as well as their domestic fruit gard ens, bamboo and teak orchards, on which they traditionally rely for their subsistence economies. It was reported that the cases reported above may be in violation of article 26 (1) of the 1997 Chittagong Hill Tr acks Accord provides that \"[n]otwithstanding anything containe d in any law for the time-being in force, no land within the boundaries of Hill District shall be given in sett lement, purchased, sold and transferred including giving lease without prior approval of the [C hittagong Hill Tracks] Counc il.\" In addition, it was reported that in those cases in which the Jumma villages lack a title deed over their traditional lands, the authorities cons ider them to be State land, freely di sposing of it to facilitate the settlement of non-indigenous settle rs. Concern was expressed that these cases may be part of a systematic campaign to support the settlement of non-indigenous familie s in the Chittagong Hill Tracks, with the active support of the security forces, with an ultimate view to outnumber the local Jumma indigenous community in the region. Concern was further expressed that this process may be deliberately taking place to coin cide with the state of emergency imposed on 11 January 2007 by the Caretaker Government. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Speci al Rapporteurs requested further information on the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, and judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to this case; whether complaints ha ve been lodged; if no inquiries were realized, an explanation to that effect; any penal, disciplina ry or administrative sanctions that were imposed on the alleged perpetrators; and if any compensation has been provided to the victims or their families. A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 9 16. On 8 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders , and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression sent a joint allegation letter to the Government of Bangladesh rega rding information they received concerning Mr. Rabindra Ghosh, the President of the Dhak a Chapter of the Human Rights Congress for Bangladesh Minorities (HRCBM). Mr . Ghosh was previously the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the then-Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the s ituation of human rights defenders on 30 August 2005 and an urgent appeal sent by the then-Special Representative together with the Special Rapporteur on the promo tion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housi ng and the Independent Expert on minority issues, on 10 August 2007. Mr. Ghosh ha s reportedly been su bject to intimidation and threats following his investig ation of a land conflic t in Jaintapur between four individuals belonging to a minority group and officials of the Jainta Press Club. Officer s at Jainta Station allegedly refused to file a complaint on behalf of the four claimants. On 29 April 2008, Mr. Ghosh was contacted by a police officer, who warned him not to investigate the matter any further; allegedly threatening hi m with criminal charges and pe rsonal injury. Mr. Ghosh claims he reported this incident to the Deputy Commi ssioner of Sylhet, who re portedly did not pursue the complaint. Mr. Ghosh subseque ntly filed a complaint regarding the incident at the Jaintapur Police Station. The Special Rapporteurs are conc erned that the intimidation and threats to Mr. Rabindra Ghosh may be direc tly related to his activities in defense of human rights, in particular land rights and rights of minority groups. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Ra pporteurs requested further information if any complaint has been lodged; on details, and where available the results, of any investigation and judicial or other inquirie s carried out in relation to this case ; and full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken. Responses received 17. On 4 February 2009, the Government of Banglad esh replied to the joint allegation letter sent by the Special Rapporteur on 8 July 2008 which was a follow up to a previous joint urgent appeal (for the summary of this urgent appe al, please refer to the Special Rapporteur Report: A/HRC/7/16/Add.1). .The Government inform ed that on 16 April 2008, Mr. Rabindra Gosh visited Jaintapur Upazilla to conduct an enqui ry into the Police Case No. 19 dated 19.6.2008 lodged in Jaintapur Police stati on. As Mr. Rabindra Gosh could not talk with Upazilla Nirbahi Officer (Head of Sub-District administration), once back to Dhaka he had a phone conversation with him. The Government indicated that a llegedly during this c onversation each side intimidated the other side and that both filed general diary with the Jaintapur Police station concerning the threats received. Neither Mr. Rabi ndra Gosh nor the Upazila Nirbahi Officer did proceed any further with their complaints made against each other. The Government further informed that the Police case No. 19 dated 19.6.2008, was lodged by Mr. A.K.M. Kudrat Ullah, Secretary of Jaintapur Press Club and the accu sed persons were Ajoy Dev, Apu Dev, Pappa Dev and Suckla Rani Dev. The accused had been enjoying a 17 decimal of land since 1980, which is owned by the Government and she was alleged to have illegally encroached Government land. The Government decided to evacuate illegal occupants of Government lands, including the portion of land illegally occupied by Suckla Rani and decided to aw ard this land to the Jaintapur Press Club. The accused persons protested while the press club authorities started to erect the office premises. This issue ended up in violence and several persons of press club were injured by the other group. The Government indicated that this case was investigated and charges were A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 10 proved against the accused and it is now pending before the court. The Government finally assured that it is always awar e to uphold, protect, promote and implement the human rights and fundamental freedoms of minorities in accordance with the law of the land. 18. On 11 April 2008, the Permanent Mission of Bangladesh acknowledged receipt of the communication of 3 April 2008 and channeling it to the capital. Observations 19. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the fina lization of this report, the Government had not transmitted any reply to his communications dated 27 December 2007 and 3 April 2008. Brazil Communications sent 20. On 3 April 2008 the Special Rapporteur together w ith the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression sent a joint allegation letter to the Government of Br azil regarding information they received concerning the reported attack against the human rights defender Mr. Welin ton da Silva, member of the Movimento Sem Terra (MST) (Movement of Landles s Peasants) which is a part of the V\u00eda Campesina network that is currently supporting the rights of the co mmunities being affected by the construction of a dam in Estreito, Maranh\u00e3o. The hydroelectric project requires the fl ooding of 400 square kilometres, affecting the lands and homes of 21,000 people, including the African-Brazilian communities of Bico do Papagayo. On 11 March 2008, at 11.30 pm, Mr. da Silva was attacked while participating in an on-si te demonstration in a quarry in Estreito, Maranh\u00e3o, to protest against the building of a dam. He was sleeping in the camp of Movimento dos Antingidos por Barragens [MAB] (Movement of Dam-affected Peopl e), in the workers' area of the quarry, when he was shot in the leg by an individual who reportedly fi red gunshots from a passing car. Mr. da Silva was taken to the Municipal Hospital in Estreito where he received treatment for his injuries. The demonstration at the quarry formed part of protests to mark the International Day of Action against Dams and for Rivers, Water and Life, on 14 March. Participants were calling for further studies to be undertaken to investigate the impact the project is to have on the River Tocantins, as well as for compensation to be given to the communities that are to be displaced as a result of the construction of the dam. It is fear ed that Mr. da Silva has been targeted as a result of his human rights activities, in particular his work to defend the land rights of communities in Brazil. The Special Rapporteurs are concerned about th e physical and psychol ogical integrity of Mr. da Silva and other members of the MST. Attacks against defe nders working on the protection of the environment and land rights in several reports fo rm part of a trend which has been detected by the Special Representative both in her report on the visit to Brazil (A/HRC/4/37/Add.2) and in some of her thematic reports. \"According to the statistics of communications sent by the Special Representati ve, the second most vul nerable group when it comes to the danger of being killed because of thei r activities in the defense of human rights, are defenders working on land rights and natural re sources.\" (A/HRC/4/37, pa ra. 45). The mandate holders reminded the Government of Brazil of the recommendations of the Special Representative contained in her report on the vi sit to Brazil (A/HRC/4/37/Add.2). In particular, A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 11 in paragraph 102 the Special Representative recommended that \"the State must play a more proactive role in mediation of social conflict and in giving legitimacy to interventions by human rights defenders to promote and protect economic , social and cultural ri ghts. In particular defenders must not be left isolated in their st ruggle for or support of social justice against powerful or influential social entities and ec onomic interests [...]\". The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing has repeatedly drawn the atte ntion of the international community to the worrying practice of forced evictions worldwid e. Forced evictions constitute prima facie violations of a wide range of internationally recognized human rights a nd large-scale evictions can only be carried out under ex ceptional circumstances and in fu ll accordance with international human rights law. In view of this, the Special Rapporteur has developed a set of guidelines, presented to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/4/18) aiming at assisting States in developing policies and legislation to prevent forced evictions at the domestic level. In this context, the mandate holders remind the recommendations ma de by the Special Rapporteur in his mission report to Brazil (E/CN.4/2005/48/Add.3). The mandate holders urge the Government of Brazil to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned person are respected and that accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured, and request that the government adopt e ffective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on the de tails, and where availabl e the results, of any investigation, medical examination, and judicial or other inquirie s which may have been carried out in relation to this case; if no inquiries were realized, an explanati on to that effect; if a complaint has been lodged; on any measures a dopted to ensure the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. da Silva and other members of the MST; on the measures adopted to implement the recommendations of the Special Representative contained in her report on the visit to Brazil and in particular the recommendation of paragraph 102 (A/HRC/4/37/Add.2). 21. On 21 April 2007, the Special Rapporteur, toge ther with the Special Rapporteur on the right to food sent a joint alle gation letter as regards of info rmation received concerning the forcible eviction of 300 families belonging to th e rural communities known as Riacho Grande, Salina da Brinca, Jurema and Melancia, in the muni cipality of Casa Nova, state of Bahia. These families claim to be established in and cultivating, the lands they were evicted from for decades. According to the information r eceived, in the early morning of 6 January 2008, agents of the civil, military and federal police, under the supervision of a judicial officer, proceeded to implement a judicial order to evict the familie s belonging to the communities of Riacho Grande, Salina da Brinca, Jurema and Melancia from the lands they claimed to be established in for decades under the regime of Fundo de Pasto, a traditional and legally recognized form of living in which the use and cultivation of the land is performed on a communal basis. Reportedly, the police acted violently, destroying houses, plantations, fences and stables, besides demanding the immediate withdrawal of all b eehives maintained by the famili es to produce and sell honey. In addition, it was reported that private security gu ards hired by two entrepreneurs who claimed title over the lands participated in the destruction of the small farmers' facilities. Also, it was alleged that even after the incident the private s ecurity guards continued to go to the area and to systematically destroy any trace of occupation of the land by these families. Faced with this situation, on 16 March 2008, the affected familie s made an attempt to reoccupy their alleged traditional lands in order to a void the continuous destruction of their indispensable means of living. It was reported that on 17 March 2008 they were violently repressed by the private security guards, who were heavily armed. The guar ds started shooting indistinctly and harassing A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 12 the people. Women and children were beaten up and four children were used as human shields. A woman that was photographing some of the a buses perpetrated was aggressed and had her camera destroyed by the guards. Later on the same day the police arrived to contain the violence and to re-establish public order. 22. According to the information received, for over a century the tradit ional communities were settled in the same area. The dispute over those lands started in 1980, when they were supposedly acquired by a private company despit e the fact that the aforesaid communities occupied and cultivated the lands long before that date. The company was established and became operational in a great part of the lands, wh ich caused the families to lose part of the lands where they raised animals and cultivated. Notw ithstanding the presence of the company, the families continued to occupy and earn their liveli hoods from the lands that were not seized by the company. A few years later, the company we nt bankrupt and the communities reoccupied the totality of the lands. Even though the former Land Institute of Bahia (INTERBA - Institute de Terras da Bahia) measured and delimitated part of the land at that time, its work was never completed. Additionally, numerous requests were made by the families to the National Institute for Land Settlement and Agrarian Reform (IN CRA - Instituto Nacional de Coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o e Reforma Agr\u00e1ria) to come up with a reasonable solution, which, unf ortunately, did not occur. It appears that after the company went bankrupt, the Bank of Brazil became its main creditor, having financed many of the company's projects. The bank ended up ceding its credit to two entrepreneurs. As the lands were given as a gua rantee for the bank loans, the two entrepreneurs initiated a judicial procedure cl aiming title of ownership over the disputed lands. The judge of first instance confirmed their title and, as a cons equence, rendered the order to evict the families that occupied the lands. The families claim the judgment to be null and void, particularly because due process was not observed in the proceedings. A representative of the Office of the Prosecutor was not notified to intervene, which should be mandatory in cases were collective rights are at stake. The Special Rapporteurs added that although they aware of the recently adopted judicial decision to reintegrate the fa milies into the disputed lands, concern is still expressed for the living conditions of these families, in particular, their right to adequate housing and food. Allegedly, many houses and facilities needed for the families' livelihoods were destroyed. In addition, they expressed concern for the security of the evicted families during and after the reintegration procedure, especially fo r the possible presence of private security guards in the area. The Special Rapporteurs referred to the General Comment No. 4 of The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which stre sses that the right to housing should not be interpreted in a narrow or restrictive sense such as merely having a roof over one's head; rather, it should be seen as the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity. It is also stated in this document that all persons should possess a de gree of security of tenure which guarantees legal protection against forced eviction, harassmen t and other threats. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations , the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on the legal status of the lands or, if it is the case, the stage of the judicial proceedings that are in place to settle the di spute over the lands; the measures adopted to guarantee the security of the families during and after the implementation of the reintegration order, especially in respect to the presence of private security guards in the area; the measures adopted in order to provide the families concerne d with shelter and livelihood and indications on whether the Government is undertaking the necessary measures in order to provide the families concerned with repara tion for their losses. A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 13 23. On 13 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur se nt an allegation lette r to the Government of Brazil to inquire about reports that, on October 23rd of that year, 1.000 families (approximately 6,000 people including a number of ch ildren and elderly people) were forcibly evicted by the Military Police, from the area they had occupied since early September of that year. The 170.000 square meters co rresponded to Varuna Real Esta te Ventures, an enterprise belonging to the economic group Construtora C.R. Almeida. According to reports received, the eviction was executed following a decision by the 19th Civil Chamber of the Central Court of Curitiba granting the reinstatement of possession to the enterprise Varuna Real Estate Ventures. Reportedly, in its decision, the C ourt had not requested any altern ative or temporary shelter for the occupants. Previous to this Court deci sion, in September 2008, the residents and housing movement supporters - such as the UNMP (Na tional Union for Popular Housing) and the CMP (Center for Popular Movements) - would have alle gedly sent several official communications to the concerned organs of the Curi tiba Municipality and the Paran\u00e1 State, requesting them to mediate in order to reach a solution. However, it was reported that nor the Municipality, neither the Paran\u00e1 State authorities woul d have entered into dialogue with the residents in order to find an alternative solution to the forced eviction. During the forced eviction, the Military Police, including officials from the Shock Battalion, woul d have allegedly used against the residents' peaceful protest tear gas, rubber bullets and trai ned dogs. It was reported that more than fifteen people would have resulted inju red by the action of the Milita ry Police, among them an eight years-old boy, and a filmmaker - Mr. Anderson Leandro from \"Quem TV,\" who would have been shot in the face. It was further alleged that the persons affected by the forced eviction would be in very precarious conditions and it se ems that no temporary location would have been provided to the majority of them and as a consequence they would have been rendered homelessness. In addition to comm ents on the accuracy of the fact s of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further inform ation on the measures that have been taken to ensure that the eviction was in accordance with Brazil's obligatio ns under international human rights law, in particular, information on any consultation undertak en with those affected; measures foreseen by the authorities to ensure that the eviction do not result in homelessness of the affected persons; on details on what was foreseen in terms of re location of the affected people and if relocation sites have been designated, on the exact locati on, including on the quality of land and access to public services and livelihood; if any assistance, financial or otherwise was provided in relation to the evictions from the occupied area in the Fazendinha Neighborhood in Curitiba. She also requested information on the current situation of the families affected by the eviction, including information on the persons who were rendered homeless; details, and, where available, the results, of any investigation, which may have be en carried out in relation to the use of undue force by law enforcement official during the eviction. Response received 24. On 10 October 2008, the Government of Brazil re plied to the joint allegation letter sent on 03 April 2008. At the time of the finalization of this report, the reply wa s still under translation. A complete summary will be provided in the Sp ecial Rapporteur's next communication report. A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 14 Cambodia Communications sent 25. On 20 March 2008 The Special Rapporteur t ogether with the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhu man or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the Indepe ndence of Judges and Lawyers sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of Cambodi a regarding information they had received regarding Mr. Pring Pov, aged 40, a police offi cer in the town of Kep. According to the information received: \"On 19 February 2008, he was arrested without a warrant by his superior, Mr. Ing Sam Ol, Police Commissi oner of Kep, and charged with 'disobeying orders from his superiors'. This stemmed from his refusal to v acate his land without compensation for the benefit of a senior government official, Eng Marie. Th e arrest was carried out on the order of the National Police Commissioner, General Hok Lundy. Af ter his arrest, Mr. Pov was transferred to the Police Discipline Unit located in Samaki village, Trapeang Krasaing commune, Russey Keo district, where he has been deta ined ever since. When his wi fe, Ms. Yin Neang, visited him on 20 February, he had open wounds on his wrists and ankles because he was shackled all night, as well as bruises on his chest. Despite hi s worsening mental and physical condition, General Hok Lundy has denied Mr. Pov a visit by a medical doctor, even after his wife brought a doctor to the detention facility herself. The legally permitted period of police custody of 72 hours, within which a detainee must be brought be fore a court to be charged, in accordance with article 96 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, ha s been exceeded. Mr. Pov was denied his right to access to legal counsel within the first 24 hours afte r his arrest in violati on of article 92 of the Code. Medical treatment of prisoners in police cu stody is left to the disc retionary power of the prosecutor and the custody officer, according to ar ticle 99 of the Code. It was reported that the Cambodian police have no jurisdic tion over land disputes. Only the municipal or provincial National Cadastral Commissions for unregistered la nd, the courts of law for registered land, and the National Authority for the Resolution of Land Disputes for unclear or politically related disputes are competent in such matters. Concerns were expressed for the state of health of Mr. Pring Pov. In addition to comments on the accu racy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further informa tion if any complaint has been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victim; on the details, and where available the results , of any investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case; on the legal basis for the arrest and de tention of Mr. Pring Pov and how these measures are compatible with applicable international hum an rights norms and standards as stipulated, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\" 26. On 3 April 2008 the Special Rapporteur, togeth er with the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Special Rapporteur on the situat ion of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, sent a joint allegation letter regarding info rmation received on the alleged illegal seizure of the lands trad itionally belonging to the indige nous Jarai people in Kong Yu and Kong Thom villages, Pate commune, O'Yadao dist rict, in Ratanakiri province. The reported situation concerns over 500 hectar es of traditional lands belongi ng to approximately 65 Jarai villagers, which have been reportedly sei zed by irregular means by an entrepreneur, Ms. Keat Kolney. Information was transmitted to the Special Rapporteurs concerning the alleged land-grabbing and illegal sale of indigenous Jara i land. According to the information received, in March 2004, four Pate commune officials and the Kong Yu village chief made several attempts A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 15 to persuade villagers from Kong Yu to sell their communal land to a buyer from Phnom Penh. The villagers refused to sell the land, stating that it was required for farming and the future needs of the community. On the last occasion, local officials reportedly claimed the land was State land and did not belong to the villagers, and said it was required to provi de land to disabled soldiers from Prime Minister Hun Sen's army. The villag ers understood that they did not have a choice, and agreed to donate an area of 50 hectares for this purpose. According to the reports, in August 2004, Ms. Keat Kolney, an entrepreneur, visited Kong Yu with the O'Yadao district governor, Pate commune chief and the village chie f, and distributed envelopes with money and gifts of sarongs to each family. Before receiving the money and gifts, the villagers were asked to thumbprint documents which they could not read, as the majority of villagers in Kong Yu and Kong Thom do not speak, read or write Kh mer. Following the ceremony, the commune and village chiefs took the envelopes from the villag ers. The next day, the village chief reportedly delivered an amount of money to each fam ily, widow and single person in Kong Yu. The villagers reportedly unders tood that the money and the gifts ha d been given as sign of gratitude for the donation of 50 hectares to disabled soldie rs, agreed in March 2004. However, they were subsequently informed that they were the paym ent for the sale of 500 hectares of land to Ms. Keat Kolney. These 500 hectares included 1 80 hectares of land that was managed and used by Kong Thom villagers, pursuant to a longstanding agreement between the two villages. It was reported that, shortly afterwards , personnel working for Ms. Keat Kolney started clearing the land to create a rubber plantation, destroying vi llagers' crops. Since then, the company has denied villagers access to the land, preventing its use as a grazing area for cattle and for planting further crops. It was reported that all these actio ns are in violation of ar ticles 23 to 28 of the Land Law, which recognize the rights of indigenous communities to collective ownership of their lands. According to Article 265 of the Land Law, it is a penal offence for an authority to commit an infringement against the land rights of an indigenous community. Further, it is reported that the alleged sale of the land to Ms. Keat Kolney is invalid under the Contract Law due to fraud. Information received also mentioned legal action against Ms. Keat Kolney and alleged intimidation on indigenous villagers and their la wyers. According to the information received, since October 2004, representatives of Kong Yu village have sought assistance from non-governmental organizations (NGO) in order to obtain the return of the land irregularly seized from them. Since 2005, Kong Yu villagers have been represented by lawyers from the Community Legal Education Center (CLEC ) and Legal Aid of Cambodia (LAC). 27. In October 2004, Kong Yu representatives re portedly filed a compla int with the local administrative office in Ratanakiri, requesting the dissolution of the Pa te commune council due to its role in facilitating the fraudulent deal. In January 2007, six representatives from Kong Yu and six representatives from Kong Thom, whose names are on file with the Special Rapporteur, filed a civil complain with the Ratanakiri pr ovincial court, seeking the cancellation of the contract of sale on the basis of fraud, and the retu rn of the land. The villagers sought the return of 450 hectares of land, as they had agreed to give 50 hectares to disabled soldiers. Also in January 2007, the 12 village repres entatives filed a criminal complaint with the Ratanakiri provincial prosecutor, requesting that Ms. Keat Ko lney, the former Kong Yu village chief, five Pate commune officials, the O'Ya dao district governor and two others be charged with fraud, forgery of private documents, corruption, brib ery and infringement of the land rights of indigenous communities. Reportedly, the Provincial Prosecutor has investigated the complaint, questioning Ms. Keat Kolney and others, but ha s not yet decided whether to pursue criminal charges against the above-mentione d individuals. In June 2007, Ms. Keat Kolney filed a criminal A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 16 complaint against the 12 village representatives , their lawyers from CL EC and LAC, and two representatives of Ratanakiri-b ased NGOs. She requested the Rata nakiri provincial prosecutor to investigate the case and pursue charges of fr aud, defamation, incitement leading to the commission of a crime, incitement not leading to the commission of a crime and complicity in an offence. The Provincial Prosecutor is reportedly investigating this comp laint. In July 2007, the former Kong Yu village chief, named in the villagers' criminal complaint, and a representative of Ms. Keat Kolney's company, the Progressi ve Farmers Associati on, brought the village representatives to the provincial court for questioning by th e Prosecutor's clerk, in connection with the criminal complaint filed by Ms. Keat Kolney. They remained during the questioning, and the former village chief translated when the villagers did not understand questions in Khmer. He reportedly asked them to speak in favor of the company, threatening them that they would otherwise not be able to return home. The villag ers' lawyers subsequently requested the formal annulment of the statements made to the Prosecu tor's clerk. However, it is reported that these statements have been submitted as evidence in the civil case by Ms. Keat Kolney's lawyer. In November 2007 and January 2008, the prosecutor hims elf questioned the village representatives with their lawyers present. The lawyers and NGO representatives have not yet been called for questioning. Concern has been e xpressed about the prospect of the villagers facing criminal charges as a result of their efforts to seek an effective remedy in relation to this case, and the proper and equitable applicati on of the law and legal proce ss. Alleged restrictions on communities, lawyers and civil society organizations defending human rights were also mentioned in the information the Special Rapporte urs received. It was re ported that since the villagers filed their action agai nst Ms. Keat Kolney, freedoms of assembly and movement have been restricted in and around Kong Yu on a number of occasions. In February 2006, approximately 200 Kong Yu villagers gathered at the Pate commune office in order to voice their concerns and seek information on the company clearing their land. Commune officials reportedly accused the villagers of holding a demonstration and causing unres t, and threatened village leaders with arrest if any further demonstrations were held. In Se ptember and November 2007, local police reportedly prevented representatives from the NGOs Cambodian Center for Human Rights and the Voice of Democracy from holding pub lic forums in the village, citing security concerns. On 23 October 2007, after spending the da y with their clients in Kong Yu village, lawyers from CLEC and LAC were reportedly denied re-entry to the village that night by district police, citing security concerns. The lawyers were admitted to the village after an intervention by a Secretary of State in the Minist ry of Interior, but were only pe rmitted to sleep in the pagoda. In December 2007, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for human rights in Cambodia visited Kong Yu during an official mission to Cambodia. The O'Yadao district chief came to the village accompanied by armed gendarmes, and asked the Special Representative and staff from the Office of the High Commissione r for Human Rights whether they had been granted authorization by provincial authorities to visit the village. 28. According to the reports, there have also been increasing numbers of accusations by authorities and the media that NGOs are 'inciting' communities to protest or complain about the violation of their rights. In this case, Cambodian media outlets have accused CLEC, LAC and other NGOs of inciting the villagers of Kong Yu and Kong Thom to take legal action against Ms. Keat Kolney, for politically-motivated reas ons. It was reported that these restrictions on freedoms of assembly, movement and expression have no basis under Cambodian law, and it is noted that the Constitution guarantees the en joyment of these freedoms. In June 2007, Ms. Keat Kolney lodged a complaint with th e Bar Association of the Kingdom of Cambodia A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 17 against 7 lawyers from CLEC and 3 lawyers from LAC. Ms Keat alleged that the lawyers incited the villagers to file complaints against her, en couraged them to defame her, and gave false information to the media. Reportedly, the Bar As sociation has initiated inquiries concerning the 10 lawyers, but has not yet ta ken a decision in relation to this complaint. The Special Rapporteurs referred to the UN Declaration on th e Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the General Assembly on 13 September 2007, and reminde d the Government of repeated statements by the Special Rapporteur on the right to adeq uate housing to drawn the attention of the international community and the Government, to the fact that forced evictions constitute prima facie violations of a wide range of internationally recognized human rights. In this context, the Special Rapporteurs reminded the recommendations contained in his mission report to Cambodia (E/CN.4/2006/41/Add.3) as well as the Basic prin ciples and guidelines on development-based evictions and displacement (con tained in document A/HRC/4/18) . In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on the actions that have been taken to implemen t and enforce the provisions of the Land Law, including the actions taken to en sure that indigenous communiti es are able to enforce their rights; in the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, full deta ils of any prosecutions which have been undertaken; if penal, disciplina ry or administrative sanctions has been imposed on the alleged perpetrators; on details, and wher e available the results, of any investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries which may ha ve been carried out in relation to this case (if no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, explanations to that regard were requested); on action that the Government is ta king to ensure that lawyers can carry out their work w ithout undue interference. 29. On 28 April 2008 the Special Rapporteur togeth er with Special Rapporteur on the right to food the sent a joint allegation letter regarding information re ceived on the forced eviction and blockade of food and medicine to families living in Kro-Year commune, Santuk district, Kompong Thom province. According to info rmation received, hundreds of poor landless families came to settle in Banteay Rogneang village in Kro-Year commune from 2005. In November 2006, 357 families, including disabled war veterans and widows, submitted a request to Kampong Thom provincial authorities for a social land concession of 800 hectares. In June 2007, provincial authorities advised the familie s to complete a form requesting a social land concession at the commune office. At the begi nning of January 2008, the number of families living in Banteay Rogneang had grown to over 1,000 families. The Kampong Thom provincial governor allegedly stated that the families were required to leave the area as an economic land concession had been granted to the Tan Bien comp any, and that they would be relocated to land in Trapeang Russey village. However, the families have reportedly refused to move to this land as it is a very small area not suitable for cultivation and containing leeches. Reportedly, on 10 January 2008, armed police, military police and military personne l, led by Forestry Administration officials, starte d controlling the only road a ccess to the village, allegedly allowing the settlers to leave the area but preventing their re-ent ry, and stopping anyone attempting to bring food or medical supplies into th e area. It is alleged that this blockade was intended to force the communities out of their home s. As a result of the blockade, it is reported that a large majority of the families were for ced to leave the area, and 160 to 170 families remained in the restricted area. Moreover, it is alleged that the security officers have threatened to burn down some houses if families do not le ave their homes and lands. According to the information received, three people of the communities were arrested on 13, 15 and 20 January 2008 and released after being forced to sign an agreement to accept alternate land or A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 18 other forms of compensation in exchange of the land they had. It is reported that other people have been forced to sign similar agreements. A ccording to information received, the blockade was discontinued in mid February, and hundreds of families who had left the area returned to Banteay Rogneang village. On 6 or 7 March 2008, the blockade was reinstated for a week. This decision was allegedly taken by the Santuk district police chie f upon the orders of the Kompong Thom provincial governor. Reportedly, the bl ockade of food and medicine had grave consequences for the health and well-being of the community. It is reported that families suffered food shortages leading to malnutrition, and that a number of individuals fell gravely ill from malaria and were unable to access medicat ion. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporte urs requested further information on legal basis on which the evictions were carri ed out, and whom decided the evictions; whether appropriate consultation with the communities and affected persons was undertaken ; whether alternative solutions to the evictions and displacements of these communities have been studied; whether the communities and affected persons were given adequate and reasonable prior notice before the eviction; whether the communities and affected persons had the opportunity to seek redress without sanction, whether judicial recourse was made available to the affected persons, if any access to due process for the poor and people with low income of these communities has been foreseen. They requested further information on whether any complaints have been lodged; whether sufficient information was provided to those affected by the evictions; whether the communities and affected persons were offered compensation for the loss of their houses and livelihood; and further details on any measures th at have been foreseen to ensure that the evictions do not result in homele ssness of the affected persons , details on relocation of the affected people. 30. On 13 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur and the Special Re presentative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent a joint allegation letter to the Government of Cambodia concerning information r eceived regarding the arrest and detention of community representatives and citizens facing forced eviction in Sihanoukville's Mittaheap District and in Dey Krahom in Phnom Penh. They recalled the situations brought to the attention of the Royal Government of Cambodia by th e Special Rapporteur on adequate housing in previous communications (dated 30 Se ptember 2005, 11 November 2005, 5 May 2006 and 5 February 2007) and raised further concerns re garding the pursuit of cr iminal charges against community members facing eviction. Concern was expressed regarding the reported increase in forced evictions throughout Cambodia and th e conduct of the evictions and resettlement. According to information received, more than 1 1,000 families have been forcibly evicted in the Municipality of Phnom Penh between 1998 and 2003. Since then, forced evictions have reportedly displaced over 30,000 people in the capital. So far in 2008, around 150,000 Cambodians across the country were known to be at risk of being forcibly evicted as a result of development projects, land disputes and land grabbing. A pattern of violation of rights has been alleged during the conduct of these forced evictions and resettlement: There has been a systematic lack of due pr ocess and procedural protections, including establishing the legal basis of evictions, consultation with affected communities; adequate notice of pending evictions, and access to legal remedies and assistance. A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 19 Compensation, if offered, is far below the market value of the properties that the communities are vacating and there is a lack of effective remedies for communities facing eviction. Resettlement s ites, typically located in remote and undeveloped areas far from the city, rarely provide basic services and infrastructure. In many cases, police and/or military use excessive force or threaten to use unnecessary force in order to remove residents and destroy their homes and other material possessions. NGOs have been subject to campaigns of hara ssment and intimidati on in relation to the forced evictions. Human rights activists have been denied access to sites of human rights violations and are subject to similar campaigns of harassment and intimidations. Lawyers acting for clients in land disputes ha ve been subject to criminal investigation. 31. Concern was particularly expressed regardi ng the alleged pursuit of criminal charges against community members facing eviction. It has been alleged that certain community representatives and citizens have been targeted by authorities with criminal sanctions. These sanctions have been used to intimidate and silenc e community representatives as well as ordinary villagers from exercising their democratic right to demonstrate over land disputes in regards to the forced evictions. It was also alleged that the authorities and courts have failed to protect these community representatives and citiz ens from the reported misuse of the criminal justice system. It was alleged that the court has failed to deli ver justice equally and e xpeditiously to community representatives and citizens, including the poor and marginalized. This includes the alleged unwillingness of the court to throw out cases th at have no merit immediately. According to information provided, the number of individuals arrested and detained because of their involvement in land disputes has more th an doubled since 2005. During 2005, 53 poor persons involved in land disputes were arrested and de tained. During 2006, 78 persons were arrested and detained. By 2007, this number had increased to at least 121 persons. In th e first six months of 2008, at least 33 villagers were arrested and deta ined. In the majority of cases, people were reportedly charged with criminal offences with little evidence behind th e charges, the arrests preventing them from acting to defend the land under dispute or protest against perceived violations of their rights. In this context, the mandate hol ders discussed two cases which illustrate these concerns. On 20 April 2007, 105 families were forcibly evicted from Sihanoukville's Mittapheap District . It was reported that hundreds of armed police and military personnel used excessive force to evict the families, injuring 18 people, burning houses, destroying property and looti ng material possessions. This case was the object of a communication by the Special Rapporteur on ade quate housing, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on the right to food on 7 June 2007, for which no response has been received to date. Additional in formation received indicates that following the eviction, 14 villagers were charged with battery with injury and wrongful damage to property, or complicity in these crimes. At the trial on 4 a nd 5 July 2007, the prosecution allegedly did not produce evidence linking the defendants to the al leged crimes, and police officers who testified for the prosecution were allegedl y unable to confirm that any of the defendants had in fact committed assault or caused damage. Yet the trial judge convicted 9 men, and sentenced 7 men to 75 days imprisonment and 2 men (one of them convicted in absentia) to 8 months A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 20 imprisonment, to be suspended after 4 mont hs served. The remaining 5 defendants were acquitted and released. The court reportedly refused to examine the merits of the eviction, and allegedly no action was subsequently taken agains t police and military in relation to the physical violence and destruction of pr operty during the eviction. The seve n villagers who were sentenced to 75 days imprisonment had largely served their se ntence in pretrial detention and were due for release on 7 July 2007. The second man who recei ved a 4-month custodial sentence (and a 4-month suspended sentence) was due for release on 20 August 2007. However, all 8 men remained in custody due to an appeal by the provin cial prosecutor against their sentences, lodged on 5 July 2007. It was reported that there were excessive delays pr ior to the appeal being heard by the Appeals Court on 3 April 2008, when the Court upheld the original sentences imposed by the trial judge. Thus, when the 8 men were released from prison on 10 April 2008, 7 men had been detained for close to 9 months in excess of their sentence, and one man had been detained for 7 and a half months in excess of his sent ence. Similarly, it was reported that over 100 families are facing forced eviction from Dey Kr ahom in central Phnom Penh. Since late 2003, a private company named 7NG has been negotiating with community members to exchange their land for an apartment on the outskirts of the city, enabling 7NG to redevelop the site. The majority of the community has agreed to exchan ge their land for apartments, but it is reported that over 100 families still remain in Dey Krahom. It was alleged that 7NG, acting either through the police and military police or di rectly through its officials, has been involved in intimidatory action, such as violent incident s within and against the commun ity, reportedly intended to push the remaining families to sell their houses to th e company. It was also reported that 7NG is offering to buy families' land at prices well below th e market rates, and that some families have accepted out of fear of eviction. In this contex t, it was reported that at least 14 community representatives and community members from De y Krahom are facing criminal charges, which are allegedly not well founded and may have be en pursued to discourage community members from resisting eviction or organi zing against eviction. It is report ed that a number of community leaders face multiple charges. It is reported that three people were found guilty of battery with injury and sentenced to 2 month suspended sent ences; a woman was convict ed with battery with injury and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment and a further 18 month suspended sentence; five people are charged with wrongful damage to propert y; one person is charged with robbery; five people are charged with destructi on of police property; eight people are charged with destruction of commune property; at least three people are charged with wrongful damage to property and battery with injury; and five people are charged in relation to an incident where a truck was set on fire on the night of 7 January 2008. In all of these cases, it was alleged that there is an insufficient factual basis to suppor t the charges, or evidence to link the individuals to the crimes of which they are accused. In many cases, eyewitn esses have denied that the alleged crimes took place, or that the accused people were involved. It was further reported that 7NG filed a civil action against 58 families for breach of contract, a lleging they had agreed to exchange their land for an apartment, but had failed to comply with the contract. The concerned families either denied placing their thumbprints on the contracts, or alleged they were coerced into doing so. It is reported that the court arbitrated in favor of 7NG on 8 November 2007 and gave the families three weeks to vacate their houses. The mandate holders referred to th e recommendation made in this report by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General th at \"no one should be imprisoned in relation to protecti ng their rights to land and housing and anyone detained in this context should be released\". In the context of the events repor ted in the present letter, the mandate holders urged the Government of Cambodi a to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the aforementi oned persons are respected and accountability of A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 21 any person guilty of the alleged violations ensured. They also requested that the Government adopt effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Sp ecial Rapporteurs requested further information on the measures taken to ensure that the evictions are in accordance with Cambodia's obligations under international human rights law; on the measures taken to ensure that private companies such as 7NG respect international law in the de alings with communities; on the measures taken to ensure equal access to the courts for communi ties and their representati ves affected by forced evictions, in particular in the Dey Khrom case; on de tails, and, where available, the results of any investigation and judicial or othe r inquiries into the criminal pro ceedings of the 14 villagers into Sihanoukville's Mittapheap District; and an explanation if no inquires have taken place or if they have been inconclusive; on measures take n to ensure the ability of non-government organizations to conduct their activities. Observations 32.

On 5 March 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situa tion of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, and the Speci al Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers sent a joint allegation letter to the Government of the People's Republic of China, regarding information they received in relation to Mr. Zh eng Enchong, a human rights lawyer in Shanghai. Mr. Zheng Enchong has been the subject of thr ee communications sent by mandate holders; an A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 24 urgent appeal sent by the Speci al Representative, together wi th the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to free dom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, su mmary or arbitrary executions on 16 March 2004, an urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative, together with the Sp ecial Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers on 20 July 20 06, and an urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative, together with the Special Rappo rteur on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living on 27 July 2007. The mandate holders, authors of this current co mmunication, acknowledged receipt of the response of the Government of the PRC dated 18 December 2007, however, it does not entirely dispel their concerns regarding th e situation of Mr. Zheng Encong, as illustrated by the new information they received. On 16 and 17 February 2008, Mr. Zheng Enchong was reportedly assaulted by police officers who were following him and his wife, Ms Jiang Meili. Later on 17 February 2008, he was summoned to the police station and detained for over 12 hours, during which time he was beaten by unide ntified men. The police reportedly questioned Mr. Zheng Enchong about legal aid he recently provi ded to petitioners and victims of land grabs. The questions also focused on an interview Mr . Zheng Enchong had given to the Epoch Times on 12 February 2008, in which he discussed the corruption case of Shanghai tycoon Mr. Zhou Zhengyi and the possible involvement of former Chinese Communist Party leader Mr. Huang Ju. On 19 February 2008, the interv iew to the Epoch Times was published and the following day, Mr. Zheng was again arrested. While in detention, he was once more beaten by an unidentified person, sustaining injuri es as a result, before being released that evening. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Zheng Enchong may be directly related to his activities in defense of human right s. In view of allegations of ill-treatment, further concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Zheng Enchong. The mandate holders requested clarification of the circumstances regarding the case of the person named above. The mandate holders stressed that each Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental inte grity of all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, th e International Covenant on Civ il and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, In human or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the f acts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on whether a comp laint has been lodged, on the legal grounds for the arrest, detention and questioning of Mr . Zheng Enchong, and how these measures are compatible with international norms and standa rds; on details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken against the officers who allegedly assaulted Mr. Zheng Encong; and regarding any penal, disciplinary or administrative sa nctions imposed on the alleged perpetrators. 36. On 28 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situa tion of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, and the members of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention sent a joint urgent appeal to the People\u00b4s Republic of Ch ina regarding Mr. Ye Guozhu. Mr. Ye has already been the subject of a joint communication sent by the then Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequa te standard of living, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 5 April 2005, which regrettably went unanswere d. On 22 July 2008, Mr. Ye Guozhu was taken away from Chaobai Prison in Tianjin by officers of the Beijing Public Security Bureau (PSB), Xuanwu Sub-division, where he ha s been serving a prison sentence that was due to come to an A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 25 end on 26 July 2008. His brother received a call from the prison authorities at around 4 pm on 22 July, explaining that it would not be necessary for him to come and pick up his brother on 26 July. Mr. Ye's brother immediately called th e police in Xuanwu, who initially denied any knowledge of Mr. Ye Guozhu's whereabouts, howe ver, later admitted that Mr. Ye had been transferred from Chaobai Pris on. The authorities refused to disclose Mr. Ye's place and envisaged duration of detention. Mr. Ye Guozhu was active in a ssisting petitioners to file complaints with the central government agains t forced evictions. After he had applied for permission, in August 2004, to organize the so called \"September 18 10,000 People March\" he was sentenced by the Beijing Intermediate People's Court to four years in prison for \"disturbing the social order\". He was repor tedly ill-treated while in dete ntion. In view of his reported incommunicado detention at an undisclosed place of detention grave concerns were expressed as regards Mr. Ye Guozhu's physical and psychologi cal integrity. Further concern was expressed that Mr. Ye's continued detention beyond the report ed release date might be solely connected to his previous activities in defe nce of human rights and the upcom ing Olympic Games. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on any complaint lodged by or on behalf of Mr. Ye Guozhu; on the legal basis for the continued detention of Mr. Ye Guozhu and how these measures are compatible with international norms and standards as contained, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Declaration on Human Rights De fenders; and on the current whereabouts of Mr. Ye Guozhu. Responses received 37. On 24 April 2008, the Government of the Peopl e's Republic of China replied to the joint allegation letter sent by the Speci al Rapporteurs on 5 March 2008. At the time of the finalization of this report, the reply was still under transl ation. A complete summary will be provided in the Special Rapporteur's next communication report. 38.

On 11 December 2007, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, sent a joint allegation letter rega rding the human rights situation of the Mursi the Omo, Mago and Nech Sar National Parks, located in South Ethiopia. The alleged human right s violations occurred in theses indigenous and minorities communities and allegedly caused by the Omo, Mago and Nech Sar National Parks, were the subject of a joint communication se nt to the Government on 15 August 2006 by the Special Rapporteur on the situa tion of the human rights and funda mental freedoms of indigenous people, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and the Speci al Representative of the Secr etary-General on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons. The Special Rapporteurs referred to the information they continued to receive, partic ularly regarding the adopti on on 21st August 2007 of the Development Conservation and Utilization of Wildlife Proclamation No 541/2007, concerning all National Parks in Ethiopia. Reportedly, the Mursi and the Suri, Dizi, Banna, Aari communities, consisting of approximately 130 000 persons, are semi-nomadic people. Their traditional lands and territories are, today, in and around the Omo, Mago and Nech Sar National Parks. Although the bordering process began only last year, th e Omo National Park (4,068 sq. km.) was designated in 1966 and the Mago National Park (2,162 sq. km.) in 1978. A ccording to the information received, the affected communities traditionall y practice rain-fed cultivation, cat tle herding, as well as hunting and fishing. For climatic reasons and for the neces sity of the traditional agriculture and cattle breeding, these communities move in and out the boundaries of these National Parks. For example, as the weather in the region is very dry, these communities gather, cultivate and shepherd their cattle w ithin the boundaries of the parks due to their fertility and the proximity of water sources. It was also alleged that 75 percen t of the total Mursi's f ood supplies used to come from land now included in these parks. The Murs i depend on three main subsistence activities: flood retreat cultivation, ra in-fed cultivation and cattle herding. Their diet depends mostly on the products they grow on this land while cattle, ap art from being an important source of milk (especially for children) and meat, are a vital stan dby at times of crop failure, when they can be exchanged for grain in the highlands. Because of their relatively small num ber of cattle, the low and unpredictable local rainfall and the wide annu al fluctuation in the level of the Omo flood, the Mursi must integrate all three of these sources of subsistence by means of a complex cycle of seasonal movements. This mix of subsistence ac tivities, and the seasonal movement of people and cattle, has reportedly been the main condition both of Mursi survival and of the sustainable use of renewable resources in this area. Moreove r, according to the information received, there are two harvests each year, one along the banks of the two permanent rivers, Omo and Mago, where fertile silt is deposited by the annual flood, and one in forested areas further away from the rivers which are cleared for rain-fed, shifting cultivation. Planting take s place on the banks of the Omo and Mago in October and November, after the flood has receded and the banks have been cleared of vegetation that had grown up si nce the previous season. The harvest comes in January and February. River-bank land is the most valuable agricultural resource the Mursi possess. The unpredictability, caused by the weat her and floods, coupled with the limited area available for flood retreat cultivation makes ca ttle a vital resource fo r the Mursi and they A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 30 attribute overwhelming cultural importance to cattle . Every significant social relationship - most notably marriage - is marked and validated by the exchange of cattle. The Development Conservation and Utilization of Wildlife Proclamation No 541/2007 adopted on 21st August 2007 reportedly aims at strengthening so me of the provisions already included in the Agreement signed on 4th November 2005 between the Government and the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Regional State, and African Parks (Ethiopia) PLC concerning the management of the Omo Nationals Parks. The Government reportedly transferred the management of all Nationals Parks to African Parks (Ethiopia) PLC, a private company and a subsidiary of Stichting African Parks Founda tion (\"African Parks\"), a Netherlands-based organization that manages conservation of parks throughout Africa. The African Parks (Ethiopia) PLC management for the Omo National Park ha s been effective sin ce January 2006 after the signing of the 4th November 2005 Agreement, whereas in February 2004, African Parks Foundation signed an agreement with the Govern ment allowing it to manage the Nech Sar National Park on a 25 year lease. The 2005 Agr eement reportedly provided employees of the African Parks powers of law enforcement similar to those of public officials. It was also alleged that, through Proclamation No. 541/2007, restrictions and regulations have been imposed on the communities regarding the use and enjoyment of their ancestral land s. These restrictions and regulations reportedly prev ent them from fishing and hu nting without a permit. This Proclamation also established an \"anti-poaching\" fund, a no tr ee felling policy, and entrance fees. It also provided for the cont rol of visitor use and included th e construction of a fence in and around the Park. It appears that the same restrictio ns have been applied to the Nech Sar National Park, also managed by the African Parks (Ethiopi a) PLC. It was alleged that the December 2006 report of the African Parks Foundation identified as one of the \"illegal activities\" in the Omo National Park the Mursi traditional livelihood practic es like clearing of land for cultivation or hunting. According to the information receive d, the Development Conservation and Utilization of Wildlife Proclamation No 541/2007 adopted the 21st August 2007 was signed and managed without the free, prior and informed consent of the Mursi and others affected communities. According to these allegations, a \"demarcation ce remony\" was held in the Omo National Park in March 2005, at which members of various loca l groups were asked to sign (with their thumbprints) documents describing the park bou ndaries. In July 2005, game guards, that are employees of the Mago National Park, visited th e Mursi settlement of Maganto (known to the government as Hailu Wuha) and allegedly persua ded three men to put their thumbprints on a document defining the Mago Park boundaries. As a result, the Mursi and the other affected communities living in the Omo and Mago Parks re portedly became illegal squatters on their own land. The lacks of sufficient information in the languages of the affected communities and sufficient time for prior and informed consent acc ording to tribal custom s have also reportedly affected the process. It also appears that the Development Conservation and Utilization of Wildlife Proclamation No 541/2007 is in contradi ction with the Constitution whose Article 40 proclaims that \"Ethiopian pastoralists have the right to free land for grazing and cultivation as well as the right not to be displaced from their own lands\". In addition Article 32 stipulates that \"Any Ethiopian or foreign nationa l lawfully in Ethiopia has, within the national territory, the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his reside nce (...)\". The Special Rapporteur mentioned interdictions of hunting and others tr aditional subsistence practices in all national parks. According to the information received, th e Development Conservati on and Utilization of Wildlife Proclamation No 541/2007 created different categories of \"wildlife conservation area\". One category is \"wildlife reserv es\" \"designated to conserve wildlife where indigenous local A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 31 communities are allowed \"to live together with a nd conserve wildlife\". Another category created by this Proclamation is called \"national parks\" where local communities are not allowed to \"live together with and conserve wildlife\". Accord ing to the information received, hunting, fishing, clearing of land, tree feeling in the Omo, Mago and Nech Sar Nationals Parks without specific authorizations are proscribed. Article 8 of th e Proclamation No 541/2007 states that, \"No person, other than the Ministry or the co ncerned regional organ in the di scharge of their duties, may hunt any game animal unless he is in possession of a hunting permit.\" Further, according to Article 15 of the Proclamation states that \"a wildlife anti-p oaching officer shall have the following powers: 1. to require any person who is in possession of wildlife or wildlife products to show the permit authorizing such possession; 2. to enter and se arch any private landholding, building, tent, (...) as well as search bags or sealed items, without court order, where there are sufficient grounds to believe that wildlife or wildlife products ar e kept illegally; 4. wh ere a person is found committing an offence in violation of Article 16 of this Proclamation, to detain, without any court order, and handover him to the appropr iate law enforcing body.\" In addition, and concerning the penalties in case of violations of the provisions of this Proclamation, Article 16 states that \"(1) Unless it enta ils higher penalty under the cr iminal law: (a) any person who (i) commits an act of illegal wildlife hunting or trade; (ii) carries out unauthorized activities within wildlife conservation areas or causes, in whatever way damage therefore, or; iii) is found in possession of wildlife or w ildlife products without having a permit, shall be punished with fine not less than Birr 5,000 and not exceedi ng Birr 30,000 or with imprisonment not less than one year and not exceeding five years or with both such fine and imprisonment\"; (b) any person who commits other offences in violation of the provisions of the Proclamation or regulations or directives issued hereunder shall be punished wi th fine not less than Birr 500 and not exceeding Birr 3 000 or with imprisonment not less than one month and not exceeding six months or with both such fine and imprisonment.\" According to the provisions of the Proclamation, occupation and use of land for flood retreat or rain fed cultivation by the Mursi, Aari peoples, in and around the boundaries of the Omo, Mago, and Nech Sar National Parks, may constitute an \"unauthorized activity which could lead to imprisonment or imposition of a fine. Such interdictions may have a negativ e impact on the ability of th e Mursi and others affected communities to maintain their usual access to sufficient and adequate food and threaten their physical and food security. In addition the \"no tree felling\" policy may especially affect those groups that practice shifting cultivation such as the Suri, Dizi, and Me'en as it may be more difficult for these groups to clear new river ba nk sites for cultivati on. Hunting is a very significant part of the economies of these comm unities, and as a result, the restrictions on hunting may also contribute to reduce their us ual access to food. The Special Rapporteur also referred to limitations imposed on the communities' freedom of movement Freedom of movement of Mursi, in and out the Omo, Mago, Nech Sar National Parks, is allegedly threatened by the provisions of this Proclamation which allow African Parks to charge entrance fees, without making any exception fo r indigenous people, and grant the company authority to construct a fence in and around the pa rks. Reports indicate th at there are plans to build a fence around Nech Sar National Park and employ other measures to strictly limit the communities' ability to move, hunt and cultivat e land freely in and out of the area. The restrictions of movement may have a negativ e impact on these communities because their subsistence food and their social organization de pend on their ability to move on their ancestral lands. These groups combine cattle herding with both flood-retreat and rain-fed cultivation. A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 32 Because of the spatial distribution of agri cultural and grazing la nd, and because of the unreliability of rainfall in this semi-arid environm ent, the successful utilization of these resources requires regular seasonal movements, over relative ly short distances, by most members of these groups. In regard to the situation describe d above, the Special Rapporteurs draw the Government's attention on the elements contai ned in the Basic princi ples and guidelines on development-based evictions and displacement contained in the most recent report of the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing (A/H RC/4/18), aiming to clarify certain State obligations in this context. He also referred to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the General Assembly on 13 September 2007, and on the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination Genera l Comment XXIII on the Rights of indigenous peoples. The Committee calls upon States partie s \"to recognize and pr otect the rights of indigenous peoples to own, deve lop, control and use their communal lands, territories and resources\" (51\u00ba period of session, 1997, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.7, paragraph 5). The Special Rapporteur mentioned the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural rights and particularly the General Comment 14 concerning the right to the highest attainable st andard of health, and added that the right to food and water is protecte d by international human ri ghts law, referring to the report of the Special Rapporteur on the ri ght to food following his visit to Ethiopia in February 2004 (E/CN.4/2005/47/Add.1, 8 February 2005) which recommended, inter alia, that land tenure must be secured to ensure that peopl e have secure rights over their own land and that all government programme and policy designs should ensure appropriate levels of participation, non-discrimination, transparency and accountability. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporte urs requested further information on the extent to which provisions of the Development Cons ervation and Utilization of Wildlife Proclamation No 541/200 have already been applied to individuals belonging to the communities since its entry into force; the short and long-term m easures planned and/or taken by the relevant authorities to ensure that the Mursi communities are able to maintain their usual access to traditional livelihoods and their freedom of m ovement in and around the Omo, Mago and Nech Sar National Parks. Observation 44. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the fina lization of this report, the Government had not transmitted a ny reply to this communication. Greece Response received 45. On 26 August 2008, the Government of Gr eece sent a reply in response to a joint communication dated 20 July 2007 sent by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, the Independent Expert on Minority Issues and the Special Rappor teur on contemporary forms of racism, concerning alleged forced evictions of Ro ma in Patras and other locations in Greece. The summary of this joint communication is contained in the communication report A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 paragraph 50. The Government's reply contai ns the following information: \"The integration of Roma into the society is a very complex, multi-faceted social problem which all European countries with a Roma population face. It can only be solved through the A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 33 application of consistent efforts, financial s upport and a constructive attitude from all sides involved, including local societies and the Roma. Greek Roma, or Greek Gypsies, which is the term used in Greece by themselves in most cases are not registered separa tely from other Greek citizens, either during the nationa l census, or in the municipal rolls. As a result, there is no precise official number of Roma populations as such. Some st udies drawn up with a view to designing and implementing social actions and programs for the Roma indicate a population of approximately 250,000 to 300,000 persons all over Greece. Roma living in Greece are largely an integral part of the Greek populat ion and they are protected agai nst all forms of discrimination, by the Greek laws and the Constitution. They enjoy the same civil and political rights, they participate in Greek society, they organize themse lves in associations, political parties, etc. Regarding the questions raised by the above-menti oned joint letter please be informed of the following: A. Facts regarding the allege d forced evictions in Patras 46. According to recent data (fie ld visit held on 14/04/2008 by the Public Health Directorate of the Region of Western Greece), the Municipality of Patras has one Roma settlement at the Riganokampos area, where 20 shacks and one prefabricated house exist. The members of the field visit team met with the people of the sett lement who stated that those who have been granted a housing loan are alr eady looking for a proper house to buy in order to move from the settlement. Based on the statistical data of the housing loans program (operated by the Ministry of the Interior) and the terms of the identification documents submitted (i.e. identity card, certificate of marital status, et c.) from 2002-2006, a total of 50 loans have been granted to an equal number of families residing permanently at or being registered with the Municipality of Patras. In 2007-2008, (second operation phase of th e program), another 34 loans were also processed. Therefore, the number of families to have been granted a housing loan through the Municipality of Patras runs, to date, to a total of 84 families. It is necessary to note that the Ministry has issued and maintains a database with all necessary individual administrative documents for the qualification of the above-men tioned beneficiary families. We should take into consideration the fact that each application doesn't always stand for one independent family. It should be pointed out that, for various reasons, many Roma/Gypsy families submitted more than one applications for housing loans per family (e.g. one application by the husband and another by the wife), not always to the same authorities, sometimes in spite of the fact that they have already been granted a housi ng loan (from the same project) in the past. Furthermore, in view of presenting quantity data on the number of the loans granted to Greek Gypsies, since the beginning of the program (2002-2008) and bearing in mind that the reference to the Roma \"living in the greater area of Patras\" lacks a precise geographical definition necessary for the retrieval of any such data, we herewith pres ent the following statistical analysis based on research criteria related to \"Patra s greater area\" and in particular: 47. Greek Gypsies with an affiliation to Patras (r esiding in or registered in) who applied for a loan at the Municipality of Patr as or other municipalities, whet her at the time of the submission of their application they were re gistered with the municipal rolls of Patras or other municipalities (ref. table 1). 48. Greek Gypsies who submitted their application to a Municipality belonging to the greater area of Western Greece, beari ng in mind that neither the lo an nomination, nor any other provision restricts the settl ement or even the use of the loan to the settling down to a particular A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 34 region of the Greek territory. This has also been apparent from table 1, wh ere it is shown that citizens of non-neighboring or adjacent municipa lities to the Municipality of Patras submitted, however, their applications to the latter. According to the relevant figures it is noted that: 881 families registered in the municipal rolls of a municipality in the Region of Western Greece applied successfully for a loan to a num ber of municipalities within or out of that region (45 municipalities, including Patras). 866 families applied and got nominated for a loan through 33 different municipalities of Western Greece Region (including the Municipality of Patras). In Achaia Prefecture alone to which the Muni cipality of Patras belongs, 285 beneficiary families submitted an application to a Municipality falling within that territory. Finally, it is stated that the above-menti oned Housing Loans Progr am addresses housing needs of all Greek Gypsies residing in the Greek territory, regardless of their religion or beliefs, and, to date, has granted a total of 6.984 loans to an equal number of gypsy families (beneficiaries). Among them, a total of 5.689 beneficiaries have disbursed their loans from the banks cooperating with the Program. The disparity between the loans granted and the disbursements is explaine d by the fact that the disbursement is processed upon the beneficiarie s' responsibility and initiati ve. Practically, this means that the disbursal of the loan depends on the submission of the proper documentation for the house to be purchased/built/complete d, by the interested persons to the bank. B. Facts regarding alleged pattern of forced evictions of Roma in Greece 49. In the case of the Roma/Gypsies that used to live in shanks at the banks of Gallikos river, the solution has been given, as already pointed out in the Special Pro cedures' mandate holders' letter, by relocating them to a former military barracks (Gonos military camp). The municipal authorities have been improving the living cond itions both in the camp and in the wider area outside the camp by performing infrastructure work s (roads, electricity, medical - social services, playgrounds, etc.) In the case of th e 200 Roma/Gypsies that used to live in shanks at the Olympic complex in Maroussi, Athens, they were relocated to rented homes where the rent was paid by the Municipality of Maroussi for an initial pe riod of time and not inde finitely since lifetime payment of financial rental benefits to the Roma (in addition to those provided as social benefits for the whole population and, therefore, to the Roma too) only leads to a dangerous distortion of the State's obligation toward the fighting against social exclusion and the equal treatment for all. Let alone that, in parallel, a housing loan pr ogram, guaranteed by the State budget, was offered to those interested; as a result, 21 out of th e 34 applications submitted, were approved by the banks, that is, to all interested individuals that submitted the relevant documentation. As regards the case of the area of Votanikos , central Athens, where Albanian speaking Roma have settled arbitrarily on private property, a special Comm ittee has been set up, by decision of the Secretary General for the District of Attica, due to the seriousness of the said case (the Roma/Gypsies being recognized as a socially vulnerable group). The Committ ee was set up under article 2 of the Amendment CP/23641 of the Sanitary Provis ion A5/696/25.4.83 on the organized settlement of itinerant populations (Official Gazette of the Hellenic Republic 973/B/15.7.03). The A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 35 Committee, in its meeting of 5.3.08 expressed the vi ew that the importance of the matter calls for the preparation of a study which, upon considera tion of the specifications of the relevant ministerial decree as well as other sanitary para meters, shall recommend appropriate areas for the relocation of the Roma in question. Furthermore, the Municipality of Athens undertook to cooperate with the Union of Muni cipalities of the Wider District of Attica to prepare a draft recommendation for finding areas for the rehabilita tion of the Roma. On a more general note, the case of Patras served as a priority and at the same time as a case study. In this context, with regard to the funds allocated for the establis hment of a settlement for itinerant populations (regardless of nationality and thus for Albanian Roma too), bearing in mind that, to date, the effort made by the local and regional admini stration in western Greece didn't achieve the desirable results, the Secretary Ge neral of the Ministry of Interi or called for a [second] meeting in January 2008 (the first one took place in Nov. 2007) among the local relevant authorities (Region of Western Greece, Municipality of Pa tras) in order to speed up the process for the rehabilitation of the Romas in the wider area of Western Greece, The meeting's scope was to renew the commitment undertaken by the local au thorities in the past towards permanently addressing the situation. To this end, it was made clear that cooperation among all parties involved is necessary for maintaining as well as enhancing the efforts and measures of a temporary nature undertaken already (e.g. subsid y of rent, provision of school and social aid, etc.) It was also stressed that central administration remains supportive to the proposals the parties are going to come up with, on the condition that there will be full c onsensus by all parties concerned (i.e. the local authoriti es and the gypsies residing in th e area.) In this context, the Ministry of Interior reiterated its commi tment to grant the amount of 320.000\u20ac for the construction of the necessary infrastructures for the estab lishment of the above-mentioned settlement for temporary residing of itinerant populations. It is also worth noting that the Committee established to this end at regional level did not yield the resu lts expected, since the proposals put forth by local authorities were not met with consensus by the parties concerned. Another meeting with similar objectives took place, late 2007, upon the initiative of the National Committee of Human Rights, wh ere all parties concerned participated, such as Roma representatives, NGOs and representatives fr om central and local government. The local government bears the responsibility for addressing its local issu es, based on the principles of subsidiarity and citizen's proximity. To this e nd, we note the recent legislative reform on local government responsibilities (artic le 75, Law 3463/2006) with regard to the living conditions of their citizens. In this contex t, the central government undertak es all necessary financial and legislative measures for the prop er support of the proposals made by local authorities. It should be made clear that the Ministry of the Interior stands ready to support with the necessary funds the commitments undertaken already by the local au thorities, as well as their proposals aiming at the improvement of the existing living conditions in the area and at perm anently addressing the rehabilitation issue in question. 50. In any case, as regards the implied alleged syst ematic infringement of the right to adequate housing and the existence of discriminatory acts or even failure to act due to discrimination, we would like to emphasize the following: (a) Article 21\u00a74 of the Greek Constitution s tipulates that |obtaining a house for those who lack of or who are inadequately housed is un der the special care from the State.\" However, this doesn't imply \"neither that everyone may demand from the St ate to provide him a house, nor that if someone doesn't possess a house may by right occupy a private or public land\" (see Chapman v. United Kingdom (2001) of the European Court of Human Rights). In other words, A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 36 the obligation of the State should not be confused with the allege d right to encroach on other parties' rights whether these par ties are individuals or the public sector. The Court goes on to say that \"...even if [it involves people] of a particular racial origin or of other special characteristics, any such rights couldn't be legally recognized. Claiming the right to housing, state subsidy or to encroach on foreign property on the pure basis th at the claimant is for example of Rom origin constitutes a mere infringement of the principle of equal treatment for all at the expense of all the others.\" (b) Detailed data on the projects implemented by the state to the benefit of the socially vulnerable group of Greek Gypsies have been supplied by previous communication (our Note Verbale ref. 6171.13/45/A5 1586 dated 28 July 2006) . Nevertheless, selective reference to specific problematic situations by some seems to be pa rt of an effort to try to establish an overall, deliberate, discriminatory attitude toward the gr oup in question. For instance, the decrease of the number of homeless people in part icular settlements, such as the one in Patras, is often leading one to the hasty conclusion that this is the result of a racist policy and not the possible effect of the improvement of their living conditions (e.g. through the use of the housing loans offered and the transition to a different living status). (c) Further on, while talking about insufficien t state measures, it is worth mentioning the implied request for multiple parallel settlements for those deciding to be travelling within the territory (itinerant popula tions) due to temporary work as we ll as the selective reference to people who although already qualifying for a loan, th ey are presented as abandoned (by the state) to reside in settlements. Yet, the picture is s lightly different if one takes into account, as an indication, the fact that names of representatives [and residents] of Riganokampos settlement (in Patras, Prefecture of Achaia), Ms. Maria Vasila ri and Ms. Eleftheria Georgopoulou seem to be identical with particular name data of beneficiaries qualified for housing loans in neighboring municipalities also, both in the Prefectures of Achaia and Ilia. (d) With regard to \"forced evictions\" in Greece, it is worth mentioning that eviction is closely related to the title-righ t to property. In that sense according to article 17\u00a72 of the Greek Constitution, and article 1\u00a72 of th e International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 1 of the first Optional Protocol of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms \"...nobody may be deprived from his property unless for reasons of public interest wh ich has been adequately proved as provided by law and on the precondition of former adequate compensation.\" (e) In this context, it is inaccurate to use the term \"unlawful eviction\" when the relevant administrative act of expulsion comes in response to the unlawful occupancy of land and to the arbitrary and illegal settlement in tracts of la nd that are not owned by the occupants. Eviction, in the sense of the law, may be lawful in cases of: a. lack of property titles, b. illegal settlement in an area or c. of works of public interest concerning the propert y in question. In any case, the same legal framework applies to all citizens re siding in the Greek territory, including Greek gypsies. It is evident that all citizens, including Greek Gypsies, ha ve the right to appeal against administrative decisions before the courts. The ca ses in question refer to situations of lawful eviction or administrative removal from private or public lands. In such cases, anyhow, the Ministry of Interior tries to properly relocate the persons concerned, if possible in prior agreement with local authorities and those concerned, with a view to their permanent relocation. A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 37 (f) With regard to police behavior, it is to be noted that standard orders from the Hellenic Police Headquarters to a ll regional police departments are for absolute respect of one's personality and their human rights and of equal tr eatment of all regardless of racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, disabili ties, age or sexual orientation. Those orders are based on article 4 of the Greek Constitution, they are within the framework of Law 3303/2005 on \"equal treatment regardless of racial or ethnic orig in, religious beliefs, disabilities, age or sexual orientation\" and article 5\u00a73,4 of the Presidentia l Degree 254/2004 on \"Policemen Professional Ethics Code.\" 51. In conclusion, the success of the measures undertaken by the State s hould not be reduced to mere budget allocations or to participation in decision-making bodies; it necessitates the political will of all parties concerned, as well as the unanimous action from a wide range of Roma collective bodies. In light of those mentioned above, the state does not wish to deny its own obligations and responsibilitie s and does not consider that al l measures taken so far have yielded the anticipated results. It fully recognizes the need for combating any form of social exclusion and it deploys consid erable efforts to this end. However, a number of positive measures and actions have been implemented (s ee annexes to original letter for further information). The attached Integrated Action Pl an has entered, since 200 5, its second phase of the implementation process. The overall aim is to encourage and promote Romas/Gypsies; inclusion in the Greek society, in terms of equity and active pa rticipation in all aspects and spheres of daily life.\" India 52. On 29 February 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and conse quences sent a joint allegation letter to the Government of India concerning reports they have received regarding violence against Dalit women. Dalit women and men suffer descent based discrimination in various aspects of their lives and are also victims of vi olence and untouchability practices arising out of the caste system. Despite the formal abolition of \"Untouchability\" by article 17 of the Indian Constitution, de facto discrimination and segregation of Dalits persists, in particular in rural areas, in access to places of worship, housing, hospitals, education, water s ources, markets and other public places. Dalit women are confronted with discrimination, exclus ion and violence to a larger extent than men. Lands and properties in particular are issues of conflicts over which Dalit women have faced evictions, harassment, physical abuses and assaul ts. Dalits women are often denied access to and are evicted from their land by dominant castes, es pecially if it borders land belonging to such castes. They are therefore forced to live on th e outskirts of villages, often on barren land. Violence against Dalits is also caused due to land or property disputes. Reportedly, on many occasions, cases of violence against Dalit women ar e not registered. Adequate procedures are not taken by the police. The following specific cases have been brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteurs. They outline the impunity th at seems to prevail with respect to ensuring protection and redress for Dalit women victims of violence linked to their rights to adequate housing and property: On 25 August 2005, Mrs. Karamjeet Kaur, wife of Rashpal Singh, and her family bought a plot on Muktasar road. They built a house and started to live there. On 28 August 2005, Amrik Singh (Police official ), Davinder Singh (police official), Kuldeep Singh, Darshan Singh and Rachal, Singh abused the victims with filthy words and Caste names. They accused the family of illegally inhabiting the plot. They broke A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 38 the walls of the house and took all the goods fr om the family. Mrs. Karamjeet Kaur was beaten and hospitalised. The vict im tried to file a complaint at the police station, but the police refused to file a complaint and to take any other action. 53. Mrs. Fulwa Dewi, wife of Hardev Paswa n, owns a field where she was growing crops. On 16 November 2005, her up and stole her crops. On 13 December 2005, Mrs. Fulwa Dewi filed a complaint with the local police. The accused were arrested but were immediately released on bail. The Special Rapporterus r ecall Article 4 (b) of the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, as we ll as the Concluding Observations of The Committee on Racial Discrimination (CERD), in 2007, paragraph 20, which recommended that the Government of India \"ensure that Dalits , including Dalit women, have access to adequate and affordable land and that acts of violence ag ainst Dalits due to land disputes are punished under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act (1989).\" In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on the details, and wh ere available the results, of any investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the individual cases mentioned; details of any prosecutions against the perpetrators which have been undertaken and if any sanctions have been impos ed on the alleged perpetrators; and whether the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Preventi on of Atrocities) Act (1989) has been used to ensure remedies to the alleged victims. 54. On 5 March 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences sent a joint allegation letter to the Government of India regarding information they received conc erning Mrs. of the Dalit On 8 December 2005, around 11 a.m., approxi mately 30 persons, including 6 police officers in uniform (3 police women, 2 police men and the sub inspector), reached Mrs. Shobhavati Devi's house, in Baulia village, Shivdaspur, Post Manduvadih, Varanasi. The assailants started abusing and assaulting the Dalit women and children, and demolishing Ms. Devi's house. The reason seems to have been a land dispute. In reaction, the victims, their family members, and friends demonstrated and blocked the road at the Balia Chauraha. They were nearly 100-150 people. The Station Officer (Police station-Manduadih) and other police personnel came to the spot, but no action was taken. On 25 December 2005, Ms. Devi tried to lodge a complaint against three of the perpetrators, who were identified: Ramesh Gupta, Sontosh Gupta and Rajesh Gupta. The police neither registered it nor took a ny further action. The complaint was finally registered on 25 February 2006, only after the intervention of the District Court Varanasi where Ms Shobhavati Devi filed a case. While registering the complaint factual details of the case were contorted a nd the gravity of the incident was allegedly diminished. The victim was reportedly threaten ed to make her withdraw her complaint. The perpetrators were arrested, and on 20 April 2007 Ms Shobhavati Devi was given 6250 Rupees as compensation. On 15 November 2006, around 7 a.m., five policemen raided Mrs. Ramashree's house, in Tahirpur village, Shahabad, Hardoi, Utta r Pradesh. of them beat Mahendra, the A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 39 victim's husband. When Mrs. Ramashree asked for the reason, the policeman immediately hit her in her womb (she was pr egnant at that time) and verbally abused her with caste names. The victim sustained many injuries on her back, cheeks, stomach and vagina, and she lost her ch ild as a result of the beat ing. Two of the perpetrators were reportedly identified as Shyam Sharani Tiwari and Upadhya, who were both wearing uniforms. On 18 November 2006, the incident was reported to the local police station. One of the assailants was working th ere and refused to file a complaint. The assailant tried to persuade Mrs. Ramshree to withdraw her statement. He threatened to use his powers as a police officer against her. A suit was also filed against Mrs. Ramashree by the police officer Shya m Sharani Tiwari, who accused her of making wine and to own tools to produce alco hol. Mrs. Ramashree was sent to jail and brutally beaten. Allegedly, the above-m entioned women were not offered proper judicial remedies due to the fact that they belong to th e Dalit caste. It was reported that on many occasions, cases of violence agains t Dalit women are not registered by the police. Even if the cases are reported to the police, and the perpetrators arrested, they are usually released on bail and women's acce ss to justice is thus limited. It was also reported that the Indian government adopted the \"Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act\" in 1989, to prevent atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Tribes. According to this act, in cases of violence against Dalits, including violence against women, the police are obliged to register the case . However, the police often refuse to register the case under this act, as it imposes high prison sentences and fines. It was alleged that th e police may not agree with the purpose of the act and may try to protect the perpetrators (as their fello w caste members) by not registering cases at all, or registering them u nder a different act. The Special Rapporteurs reminded the Government of India of Article 4 (c and d) of the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on details, and where available th e results, of any investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries car ried out in relation to all i ndividual cases mentioned; on any prosecutions which have been undertaken or any sanctions imposed on the alleged perpetrators that have been identified in the two cases; whether reparation, including compensation, has been provided to the victims or the family of the victims, when not specified in the above summary; on additional information as to how the implementation of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, as well as the Supreme Court judgment highlighted above, serve to prevent and redress violence against Dalit women, and ensure that acts of violence are thoroughly investigated, prosecuted and punished. Response received 55. On 29 April 2008, the government of India sent a response to the joint communication dated 29 February 2008, concerning cases of alleged violence agai nst Dalit women in India. In this regard, the Government of India noted th at the said communication did not include any information on the places of occurrence of these cases. The government of India requested that details pertaining to the place of occurrence (village/district/State) concerning each case be provided to facilitate investiga tions by Indian authorities. A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 40 Observations 56. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the fina lization of this report, the Government had not transmitted any reply to his communications dated 5 March 2008. Iraq Communication sent 57. On 20 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur se nt an allegation lette r to the Government of Iraq regarding information r eceived concerning the danger of collapse of the Mosul Dam on the Tigris River in Ninawa Province and the potential loss of lives and property, including housing, of a large number of Iraqi citizens. According to the information received, the integrity and structure of the Mosul Dam is threatened by its weak foundation. This is allegedly because of the continuous deterioration of materials, including Gypsum and Anhydrite. The information received stated that this has resulted in cracks and leaks whic h constantly reappear and must be repaired to strengthen the foundations. The inform ation also stated that persistent digging of trenches nearby has also threatened the integr ity of the dam. The Sp ecial Rapporteur received information stating that measures had been ta ken by the Government to address the threat presented by the possible collapse of the Mosul Dam, including the injection of concrete and cement at the base. Nevertheless, on the basis of the information provided, she understood that these measures were remedial only. Allegedly, th e Mosul Dam still remained in a critical state and close to collapse. Furthermore, according to the information received, the Governor of Ninawa had requested that all water be immediately drained from the Mosul Dam in order to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe. It was al leged that this measure was refused by dam manager Abdul Khalik Thanoon Ayoub and Iraqi Minister of Water Resource Abdul Latif Rashid. Reportedly, the threatened collapse of the Mosul Dam would be a humanitarian disaster of epic proportions. The collaps e of the Mosul Dam would allegedly trigger a 20 metre wave upon the city of Mosul that would flood much of th e lands and roads from Mosul to the city of Baghdad. Also, the collapse of the Mosul Dam would allegedly endange r around the lives of about 500,000 residents and destroy villages and livelihoods. The Special Rapporteur noted concern on the basis of the facts provided, failin g to take sufficient measures to prevent the collapse of the Mosul Dam would lead to a f undamental breach of these obligations under international law, particularly in relation to th e massive loss of life and the associated loss of property, including shelter, as alleged by the facts provided. According to the information provided, an emergency plan had been prepared in the context of a disast er in respect of the Mosul Dam. In the context of the alleged emer gency plan, adequate consultation should be carried out with the affected residents with resp ect to the emergency plan. Furthermore, if the allegations have any basis, all residents who are affected by the developments regarding the Mosul Dam should be kept fully informed as long as their interests are affected. The importance of respecting human rights oblig ations in international law du ring all stages of disaster management, including prevention, was stated by the former Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, for instance at the 7 th session of the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/7/16 at 106). In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further information whether any comp laint been lodged by residents affected by the alleged insecurity of the Mosul Dam; if inform ation was provided on the situation of the dam to the population; and if the population received an y instruction or traini ng in the event of a A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 41 catastrophe. She also requested the Government to outline the measures which have been taken, at this stage and in the future, to ensure the integrity of the Mosul Dam and the safety of the neighbouring residents. Response received 58. On 23 December 2008, the Government of Iraq re plied to the joint al legation letter sent by the Special Rapporteurs on 20 November 2008. At the ti me of the finalization of this report, the reply was still under translation. A complete summary will be provided in the Special Rapporteur's next communication report. Israel Communication sent 59. On 16 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government of Israel regarding information received con cerning ongoing demolitions of houses and forced evictions carried out by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in several villages of the West Bank. According to the information, the IDF carried out house demolitions in the West Bank in the following locations: Al-Haddidiya, near Ro'I settlement, Jordan valley: Reports received claim that on 23 August 2007, the Israeli military forces demolished three barns and destroyed one house along with two sheds. It is also reported that on 6 February 2008 the IDF destroyed four residential structures housing 36 people, including some 20 children, and the adjacent animal sheds. It is reported that the families which were subsequently displaced have been living there for over 50 years. On 11 March 2008, four residential structures along with the adjacent animal pens were destroyed. A total of 34 persons were deprived of shelte r, including 26 children. Furush Beit Dajan, near Hamra settlement , Jordan Valley: On 11 March 2008, five residential structures were demolished leav ing 31 people without shelter, including at least 16 children. Al Jiftlik, Jericho: On 11 March 2008, one residential structure housing nine people including seven children was demolished. Arab ar-Ramadin, Qalqiliya: On 11 March 2008, two structures - the tent in which the family stored their fodder, and the living tent - were demolished leaving 10 persons including 6 children without shelter. Ad Deirat, near Karmel settlement, Hebron: On 19 March 2008, three residential structures sheltering at least 20 people including 14 children were demolished. Umm Lasafa, near Karmel settlement, He bron: On 19 March 2008, a house of 6 people was demolished. It is alleged that settlers from the nearby Karmel settlement have taken over by force around 400 dunams of land from the indigenous Bedouin villagers. A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 42 Qawawis and Imneizil, Hebron: On 19 March 2008, three structures and an animal pen were destroyed affecting 13 persons including 9 children. Hizma, surrounded by the settlements Pi sgat Ze'ev, Geva Binyamin and Almon, Jerusalem: On 20 March 2008, two houses, one of which was an incomplete structure, were destroyed affecting at least 5 persons. It is further reported that in January 2008 land was confiscated from Hizma and nei ghboring Beit Hanina to build 1,200 housing units for the Psigat Ze'ev settlement. Al Jib, west of Bir Nabala settlement and eas t of Giv'at Ze'ev sett lement, Jerusalem: On 20 March 2008, two residential structures we re destroyed leaving 22 persons without shelter. Anata, Jerusalem: On 2 April 2008, one house sheltering 15 persons was destroyed. 60. In the above-mentioned cases, the affected persons reportedly received eviction and demolition orders which failed to specify the date wh en demolitions were to be carried out. It is further reported that the families were allegedly given no time to remove their belongings as the IDF came to demolish their homes without prio r warning. They were allegedly not provided alternative housing and are actually homeless. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further information on the grounds to conduct such demolitions; on the legal framework governing decisions in this regard; whether the communities and affected persons were given adequate and reasonable prior notice before the eviction; whether the communities and affected persons were given adequate and reasonable time to withdraw their belongings before the destru ction of their residences; on the measures that have been foreseen by the authorities to ensure that the evictions do not result in homelessness of the affected persons and the relo cation of the affected people. Response received 61. On 24 April 2008, the Permanent Mission of Isra el in Geneva acknowledged receipt of the letter dated 16 April 2008 and channeling it to the capital. However, the Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of th is report, the Government had not transmitted any reply to his communication. Japan Communication sent 62. On 21 August 2008, the Special Ra pporteur sent an al legation letter to the Government of Japan regarding the planned priva tization of Miyashita Public Park and the plight of 34 homeless people living in the park in tents. Miyashita Park is a public park in the centre of Tokyo (Shibuya Ward). At the present moment, the City of Sh ibuya-ku is moving ahead with plans to fully renovate Miyashita Park and make it a park for the Nike Corporation. The Nike Corporation has been granted permission by the City to renovate th e park at its own cost at 450 million yen with a naming right fee of approximately 150 million yen per year. The Nike Corporation plans to convert the park into a space expressly for sports enthusiasts and to charge a fee for each future user of the park. Local residents and park frequenters have not b een informed or consulted on the A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 43 plans for the privatisation of Miyashita Park, a public space which has been for many years a focal point for citizen ac tivities and gatherings. Neither the wa rd assembly nor the city planning council has been consulted regarding the park an d almost no information about the changes can be found in the materials provided to the public . Moreover, 34 homeless peoples are currently living in tents in Miyashita Park. The proposed renovation of the park means that the homeless people will no longer be allowed to make thei r sleeping arrangements in the park. There has allegedly been no effort by authorities to find any alternative accommodation to this date. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Japa n that consultation is an essential part of the right to adequate housing, and, in this context, consulta tion of the users and neighbors of the park by urban planners and governing authorities is im portant. Public spaces such as Miyashita Park play an important role in the adequacy of housing as providing a free and open space for recreation and cohabitation in urban society. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur emphasized that homelessness frequently results in the denial also of a number of other congruent rights linked to adequate housing, such as the right to food, right to water, right to health, right to education and the right to an adequate standa rd of living. These are enshrined in the Covenant as well as expressed in the fundamental prin ciples set forth in the Universa l Declaration of Human Rights. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the f acts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on co nsultations carried out in relation to the planned privatization and development of Miyashita Park; if any objection has been raised - in writing or otherwise - in relation to the privatisation of Miyashita Pa rk; on the situation of the homeless people living in Miyashita Park, including inform ation on any planned resettlement. Response received 63. On 20 December 2008, the Government of Japan sent a reply to the Special Rapporteur in response to the communication dated 21 August 2008, in which he replied to all questions as follows: \"1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? With regard to the alleged facts in your inquiry, they are incorrect on all counts except that \"Miyashita Park is a public park in the centre of Tokyo (Shibuya Ward),\" for the following reasons: The repairs of Miyashita Park currently propos ed by a private enterprise are repairs to a municipal park meant for the improvement of its accessibility to park users and its environment. There has been no proposal for naming rights for the park to the amount of 150 million yen per year, nor has any decision been made about leasing naming rights. It is beyond the purview of the ward to be aw are of the expenses of repair to a park undertaken by a private enterpri se, and the ward has not give n permission for repairs to be made to the park. Even if this repair plan is put into practice, park users wi ll not be required to pay an admission fee. Regarding the use of its facili ties, it will be examined in detail in the future. A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 44 After formulating a repair proposal plan for the facilities of Miyashita Park, Shibuya Ward will explain the proposed plan to the Ward Assembly, its residents and park users immediately to gain their unde rstanding and move forward. As to the provision of housing to homeless peopl e in Miyashita Park, please refer to the answer to Question 4 below. Concerning Miyashita Park serving as \"adequate housing\" for homeless people, let us refer to the decision by the Supreme Court of Japan that a public park cannot be used for an address (Sup. Ct. Oct. 3 2008) and point out that Shibuya Ward is of the view that the park is illegally occupied. However, due to humanitarian considerations, Shibuya Ward has not carried out forcef ul removals and instead, as outlined in the answer to Question 4, has been encouraging transiti on by the homeless to apartment living. Please indicate what consultation, if any, has taken or will take place in relation to the planned privatization and development of Miyashita Park. Please refer to (e) of the previous answer. 2. Has there been any objection raised - in writing or otherwise - in relation to the privatization of Miyashita Park? A written petition of objection dated August 11 2008 was received from \"The Coalition to Protect Miyashita Park from B ecoming Nike Park.\" Also, from July 3 to September 12, ten individuals, including reside nts from outside Shibuya, expressed their respective views in the form of ei ght e-mails, one letter and one fax. 3. Please provide information on the sit uation of the homele ss people living in Miyashita Park, including informat ion on any planned resettlement. As of October 1 2008, about 25 homeless people live in the m unicipal Miyashita Park. Since 2006, the Tokyo Metropolitan Govern ment and local wards have carried out the cooperative \"Assistance Project for Transition to Community Life,\" helping homeless people to find apartments and employment. Moreover, for those who have remained in streets and parks, the municipalities have carried out onsite couns eling three times a month, explaining the welfare system and en couraging moves into \"Emergency Interim Protection Centers.\" Through such appro aches, the number of homeless people in Miyashita Park, which totaled 101 at the pr oject's inception, has largely decreased.\" Kyrgyzstan Communication sent 64. On 21 February 2008 the Special Ra pporteur sent an al legation letter to the Government of Kyrgyzstan concerning informa tion about alleged deaths due to severe cold weather in Kyrgyzstan. During the 2007-2008 wint er period, it has been alleged that more than 120 persons, most of them homeless, have died from cold across the country. The situ ation has been reported to be particularly critical in Bishkek where more than 50 pe ople have allegedly died. The A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 45 information received indicates that the number of homeless persons in Bishkek is growing and exceeds the capacity of emergency cen ters currently operating in the ca pital. It was reported that until the beginning of February 2008, only one government supported emergency centre (\"Kolomto\") was functioning in the Pervomaysky di strict of Bishkek. While the normal capacity of this center is for 50 persons, it is repor ted that it currently accommodates 78 people. According to information received, the Bishke k Mayor's office announced that an additional facility in Leninsky district (n ear Fuchik Park) would be opened at the beginning of February to provide food to homeless people. Further informati on indicates that at le ast one further shelter provides accommodation in the Bishkek area for homeless people. Yet, it is reported that these additional centers could not accommodate the hous ing needs of the homeless population living in Bishkek. Concerns have also been expressed th an because of the weat her and the lack of a sufficient number of equipped shelters, the life of more people may be at stake in Bishkek as well as in other regions of the country. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rappor teur requested further information on the number of persons that have died due to the cold and weather conditions in the past 4 months in Bishkek and in the rest of the country; on the measures taken by th e authorities to address this issue, including preventive measures to avoid such deaths; on the manner that the authorities assess the needs of homeless and inadequately housed persons throughout the country; on statistics, indicators and other available figures use to determine th e number of homeless people and the number of people that are living in inadequa te housing, in particular in re gard to heating, in Kyrgyzstan; and on the type and number of shelters for the home less that are in use in Bishkek and the rest of the country, and whether these shelters accessible to women and children.

Nigeria Communication sent 68. On 8 September 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions sent a joint allegation letter regarding allegations received about forced evictions and demolitions of houses in Gosa Sariki and Toge between May and June 2008, as well as threats of further evicti ons and demolitions in Abuja. They also called attention to allegations received regarding leth al use of force by the police in confronting protests related to these forced evictions. Reports indicate that in May 2008, a number of homes in the Gosa Sariki village alongside the Nnamdi Azikiwe airport road in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of Abuja were demolished by bu lldozers and residents were made homeless. According to the information received, forced evictions and demolitions were conducted with inappropriate or no prior notice. It is alleged that officials from the Department of Development Control and the Federal Capital Development Aut hority (FCDA) visited residents of the Gosa Sariki village on 5 May 2008. They informed them that homes up to 150 metres from the airport road in the village were to be demolished the ne xt day. However, it is further alleged that on 6 May 2008, bulldozers demolished homes in the Gosa Sariki village up to 300 metres from the airport road, thus a significant proportion of residents who ha d received no information were faced with the destruction of their homes. It is al so alleged that many residents in the Gosa Sariki village lost their personal belongi ngs as they were not given adequate time by FCDA officials to recover their possessions before their houses we re bulldozed. Reportedly the same situation occurred in Toge in June 2008, where houses and personal belongings were destroyed by bulldozers with insufficient or no prior notice. Re ports indicate that, as a consequence of these forced evictions, many families and individuals ar e now homeless, without shelter and living in the open air. In both cases, no adequate consu ltations had previously taken place with the affected communities and individuals. The absence of adequate relocation, accommodation or compensation has allegedly further impoverished i nhabitants of these areas that were already living in poverty. The majority of the constructions that were demolished in Gosa and Toge were reportedly housing structures of 1 to 3 rooms, stalls and shops where some community members sold their wares. It is alleged that many resi dents consequently lost their livelihoods, including those who operated small businesses from houses or in shops that were demolished. In the case of Toge, residents allegedly obtained a court injunction in early June 2008 preventing the demolition of their homes, which was served on the FCDA. A hearing was allegedly scheduled at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territo ry to decide on the issue of the demolitions. However, the information states that this inj unction was ignored by the FCDA, which carried out the demolition of homes on 13 June 2008 regardless of the court injunction. In addition, the information received alleges that the forced evictions and demo litions were carried out with disproportionate use of force, including the use of violence. The allegations state that a large police presence was brought into the community during the demolition process which targeted protestors against the demolitions with violence. It is alleged th at four protestors (Issa Buruku, Kabiru Abubakar, Dan Asebe and Ismaila Abdullahi ) with thr ee being injured and one A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 49 killed. Two of the injured are still allegedly in a critical condition. According to the reports received, the police allegedly de nied culpability during a police investigation. Reportedly, these evictions are justified by the FCDA as being pa rt of the belated implementation of the 1979 Abuja Master Plan. Allegedly, the implementation of this plan has led to a pattern of forced evictions and demolitions of informal settleme nts without consultation or compensation since 2003. Evictions and demolitions in Abuja communities and other informal settlements, including in the Municipality of Gwagwalada, have reportedly taken place since 2003/2004, by the Federal Capital Development Authority. Excluding the most recent wave of evictions and demolitions, it is alleged that the total number of dispossessed and homeless people amounts to an estimated 800,000 persons. The Special Rapporteurs reminded the Government of Nigeria that this situation was already the subject of a comm unication by the previous Special Rapporteur on adequate housing on 9 June 2006. Regretfully, no response to this communication had been received, at the date of this current communication. It has been alleged that a number of the residents in Gosa Sariki and Toge forfeited their rights to alternative measures such as compensation because they were squatting in hou ses that were not built legally. Regardless of the truth of the allegation, in General Commen t No.7 it is recognized th at \"where eviction is considered to be justified, it should be carried out in strict compliance with the relevant provisions of international human rights law a nd in accordance with general principles of reasonableness and proportionali ty\" (Paragraph 14). General Comm ent No.7 also indicates that \"state parties shall ensure, prior to carrying ou t any evictions, and part icularly those involving large groups, that all feas ible alternatives are explored in c onsultation with the affected persons, with a view to avoiding, or at least minimizing, the need to use force. Legal remedies or procedures should be provided to those who are affected by eviction orders\" (Paragraph 13). With particular concern for the rights of all resi dents of Abuja, the Special Rapporteurs urged the government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned persons are respected at the presen t and in the future. They also requested that the government, upon consideration of the legality of these actions, adopt effective measures to prevent the recurrence of acts f ound to be in contradictions of obligations unde r international human rights law to which Nigeria is a party. This includes taking all necessary measures to guarantee that rights and freedoms are protected and accountability of any persons guilty of any alleged violations are ensured. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on any notice provided to residents of the alleged evictions and demoliti ons of houses in the Gosa Sariki or Toge communities and to the alleged evictions and demolitions scheduled fo r Abuja in August and September 2008; on any consultation of resident s in relation to the alleged evictions and demolitions in the Gosa Sariki or Toge co mmunities and on the proposed consultation of residents in relation to the alleged evictions and demolitions scheduled for Abuja in August and September 2008; on any arrangements for the present or future resettlement of residents affected by alleged evictions and demolitions in the Go sa Sariki or Toge communities and on the proposed arrangements for the future resettlement of residents in relation to the alleged evictions and demolitions scheduled for Abuja in A ugust and September 2008; on any compensation provided to residents affected by alleged evictions and demolitions in the Gosa Sariki or Toge communities and on the compensation planned in respect of the future resettlement of residents in relation to the alleged evictions and de molitions scheduled for Abuja in August and September 2008; on any legal or other remedies ava ilable to those resident s allegedly affected by evictions and demolitions in the Gosa Sariki or Toge communities and whether or not use has been made of these remedies; on co urt proceedings in relation to the alleged forced evictions and A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 50 demolitions in Toge or any related proceedings (in the event that an order/verdict has been announced, whether it has been implemented) and on the implementation of the High Court injunction of June 2003; and detailed information of, and where availa ble the results, any investigation, medical examination and judicial or other inquirie s which may have been carried out in relation to the four a lleged protestors Issa Buruku, Ka biru Abubakar, Dan forced evictions and demolitions affecting the Toge community.

On 29 January 2008, the Special Rapporteur t ogether with the Representative of the Secretary-General on internally displaced persons and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of the Russian Federation, concerning reports received regarding 147 Chechen families who have been displaced to Ingushetia and Dagestan returned to the Chech en capital of Grozny. At the time of this communication, they reportedly ha d not yet found a durable soluti on and were at risk of being forcefully evicted from their place of living. On 10 January 2008, these 147 families who were living in a temporary accommodati on centre at 4 Vyborgskaia Stre et in Grozny were reportedly told by officials that they had to leave thei r accommodation at short notice. According to the information received, some inhabitants have been told they should leave before the end of the month, and officials allegedly threat ened to cut off the electricity and gas if they do not leave. It was reported that inhabitants of many other temporary accommodation centers in Grozny were also being told to leave. Thos e affected have reportedly not been consulted and no adequate alternative accommodation has been foreseen for their relocation. Especial ly during wintertime, access to adequate housing is extremely important particularly for the vulnerable groups among the internally displaced such as young children, elderly and disabled people. 73. On 21 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of the Russian Federation, concerning reports rece ived regarding Ms Carine Cl\u00e9ment, Fedotov. Ms Carine Cl\u00e9ment is a Moscow-based French sociologist, and the director of the Institute of Collective Ac tion. Ms Cl\u00e9ment is very active on housing rights and trade unions. Mr . Mikhail Beketov is a journalist and editor-in-chief of the Kimkinskaia Pravda newspaper, and is involved in the protect ion of environmental rights. Mr. Serguei Fedotov is the leader of a group supporting disenfranchised small landowners in the suburbs of Moscow. On 13 November 2008 Ms Cari ne Cl\u00e9ment was attacked near the Bilingua Club in downtown Moscow, on her way to a rou ndtable. Two unidentified man ran up to her from behind, and stabbed her in the thigh with a syringe containing an unidentified substance. On 12 November 2008, another assailant attacked Mrs. Carine Cl\u00e9ment near her house. He insulted her and spat on her. Mr s. Cl\u00e9ment filed a complaint w ith the police and went to the hospital for medical treatment. On 13 N ovember 2008, Mr. Mikhail Beketov was found by a neighbour in his courtyard of his home in th e Khimki district of Moscow. Mr. Beketov was severely beaten and was unconscious when he was taken to the hospital. He sustained a head injury, multiple broken bones, and other serious injuries. On 13 November 2008, Mr. Sergei Fedotov was attacked by two young men with baseball bats and pepper spray. Concern was expressed that the attacks on th ese human rights defenders working on economic and social rights, including on the right to adequa te housing, in the Russian Federation may form part of a broader intimidation campaign. Further c oncern was expressed that the assaults on these defenders may be solely connected to their activities in the defe nse of human rights. In addition A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 54 to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on whether any complaint ha s been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victims; on details, and where av ailable the results, of any investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case; and whether adequate housing and relocation has been provided to the victims or the family of the victims, and if not, what solution is foreseen for these families. Response received 74. On 31 December 2008 the Government of the Ru ssian Federation sent a reply to the joint urgent appeal sent on 29 January 2008. At the time of the finalization of this report, the reply was still under translation. A complete summar y will be provided in the Special Rapporteur's next communication report. Sri Lanka Communications sent 75. On 5 August 2008 the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government of Sri Lanka, concerning reports of mass forced evictions and demolitions of houses in Kompannaweediya, Colombo on 18 July 2008 and th e threat of further forced evictions and demolitions in Kompannaweediya as well as in the Mahawatha area in Colombo. Concerning the situation in Kompannaweediya area, accordi ng to the information received, on 18 July 2008, armed police carried out forced evictions , affecting around 1770 residents of the Kompannaweediya area, including many children. These people were reportedly legal and long-standing residents in the area and had paid rates and taxes to the relevant authorities. The information received indicates that 47 houses were demolished and that the police engaged in disproportionate force including vi olence and the use of tear gas, against residents who were resisting the evictions. It is also alleged that during these events, one man was arrested. In response to a notice received on 11 July to vacate the area, community representatives petitioned the Supreme Court to halt the planned evictions. Th e notice cited security c oncerns in advance of the upcoming South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit. Although the Supreme Court issued an order on 18 July to maintain the status quo until 22 July, the police still carried out the evic tions on 18 July. Later, the police assert ed that they were unaware of the order, and ceased the evictions once they were informed of the order. 900 houses remain intact pending the outcome of the court case. Many peop le did not have time to recover possessions before the evictions took place. The affected resi dents have been assigned temporary alternative housing which is inadequate, as it reportedly lacks water, sanitati on and electricity, and some of the housing was not even finished before the evictions were carried out. The information received alleges that there was no meaningful co nsultation about alternatives. The residents, who are reported to live in a situ ation of extreme poverty, are now in a heightened state of vulnerability and insecurity and many continue to live under the threat of eviction. Concerning the situation in the Mahawatha area, Colom bo according to the information received: 400 families living along the railway line in the Mahawa tha area of Colombo were ordered to vacate their houses by 28 July or 4 August (depending on when they received the letter of notice). In total, around 2,000 people would be affected by such evictions, including about 1,200 children. It is reported that the authoritie s did not consult the residents prior to delivering the eviction notices, and no alternative accommodation or co mpensation was offered. The residents have A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 55 lived in the area for several decades and there is concern that thes e residents, who already live in a situation of extreme poverty, will be rende red homeless if these evictions take place. Furthermore, it is alleged that a community l eader who was organizing the community to oppose the evictions was abducted on 21 July. He was subs equently released but reportedly coerced to drop charges he had planned to bring before the court. Additionally, a co urt case has been lodged with the Supreme Court on 31 July concer ning these evictions. Although 14 petitioners originally joined in this case, they reportedly rece ived threats, which led the majority of them to withdraw their names. Serious concern is expresse d for the safety of persons attempting to claim their rights. It has since been reported that the Supreme Court found no violation of international law and it considered that the re sidents had been given enough no tice according to national law. On humanitarian grounds, it ordere d the Attorney General to inform the railway authority to give the residents more time before imposing the evic tions, but it is unclear how much time will be allowed. Additionally, alternative accommoda tion has still not been organized, and no compensation has been offered, according to the information received. In the context of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur emphasized that forced evictions without adequate resettlement and without compensation make it impossible for impoverished citizens to have access to the basic necessities of life such as the right to food, the right to housing, the right to education and the right to an adequate standard of living. In the case of the forced evictions in Kompannaweediya, it has been alle ged that the resettlement of af fected residents in the Mutwal area is inadequate, lack ing basic facilities such as water and sanitati on. In the case of the proposed forced evictions in Mahawatha, it has been alleged that the a ffected families will be rendered homeless, as no resettlement plan has b een prepared. It has also been alleged that neither group of residents have received ade quate compensation, nor are plans in place to compensate them. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further informati on on the grounds on which such forced evictions and demolitions were conducted, on the legal framew ork governing decisions in this regard; if there was any impact assessment carried out prior to the evictions; if the affected individuals and communities were consulted before the evictions were planned; if the communities and affected persons, in the view of the Government, were gi ven adequate and reasonable prior notice before the eviction; if the communities and affected pers ons were given adequate and reasonable time to withdraw their belongings before the destruction of their residences; on the measures that have been foreseen by the authorities to ensure that the evictions do not resu lt in homelessness of the affected persons and to relocate of the affected people. The Special Rapporteur also requested clarification on whether force was used duri ng the evictions that took place on 18 July in Kompannaweediya, including deta ils about any arrests of indivi duals, and charges against them; if there has been any investig ation, medical examination, judici al or other inquiry into the allegations mentioned above; details about the case before the Supreme Court concerning the evictions in Kompannaweediya, including any subsequent decision about the 900 remaining houses and about the court case concerning the evic tions at Mahawatha, and to what extent the verdict has been implemented; on the steps taken to ensure that persons attempting to claim their rights are not threatened or hara ssed in any way, and that their rights are protected; and in the event that any alleged perpetrator(s) were identified, the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken; any sanctions that have been imposed on the alleged perpetrator. 76. On 13 November 2008 the Special Rapporteur se nt an allegation lette r to the government of Sri Lanka concerning information received regarding the planned eviction of families from at least 11 tsunami transitional shelter sites in Mo ratuwa and Ratmalana Divisions: \"The affected A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 56 tsunami transitional shelter sites are Suna ndopananda Vidyalaya, Roman Catholic DS Division (Common Building) and Karmantha Pura and Kotalawala (Common Build ing) in the Ratmalana DS Division. Reports received indicate that the transitional shelter scheme under the Tsunami Housing Policy has been an effective and widely used means of temporarily providing shelter and ot her basic services to families affected by the devasta ting effects of the Tsunami in Sri Lanka in December 2004. It is reported that, since early 2008, many families have been able gain access to adequate housing through grants from the Government of Sri Lanka . The information received indicates that the Tsunami Housing Policy allegedly entitles everyone who lost a house in the di saster to receive a ready built house or a cash grant to build a house, regardless of the sh elter they had in the past. It is alleged that the Tsunami Housing Policy awards a single grant to a household without considering the number of people constituting the household. Therefore, according to the information provided, the assist ance given to large households has been insufficient and extended families were allegedly forced to remain in the transitional shelters. Additionally, the Tsunami Housing Policy allegedl y states that tenants are not eligible to receive housing assistance. The Tsunami (Special Provisions) Act (2005) allegedly states that rent agreements between landlord and tenant remain valid even if that house was complete ly destroyed during the Tsunami. The information provided indicates th at tenants are disqua lified from housing assistance because of their old agreements yet are often unaware of their rights or unable to enforce them in respect of their agreements with their old landlord. Reports received also indicate that no adequate consultation was conduc ted with the affected families at any stage. Additionally, these groups of people were reportedly not provided with any arrangements for relocation or assistance and are consequently f acing loss of shelter and destitution. Reportedly, extended families and tenants form the majority of the residents who have been served notice of eviction for 10 October 2008 from the above listed transitional shelte rs. Additionally, some groups of people were subject to a de facto eviction when basic se rvices such as the electricity supply and sanitation facilities in some of the shelters were discontinued on 10 September 2008. According to the information provided, the planned evictions will impact upon around 499 families in 10 of these shelter sites (excluding th e Kotalawala (Common Build ing)). It is reported that a directive stating that members of extended families and former tenants are eligible for assistance that was issued by your Excellency's Government to al l Divisional Secretaries has not been followed in this respect. It is reported that the Salu Sala Shelter is one of the transitional shelters in Moratuwa which is affected by the eviction notice awarded by the Divisional Secretary of Moratuwa. Allegedly, around 90 fa milies of those remaining in Salu Sala Transitional Shelter were tenants or members of extended families and have not received any assistance or offer of relocation from the government . It is alleged that the only group in the Salu Sala transitional shelter site who had received an offer of relocation were another 11 families also occupying the shelter because the alte rnative housing already provided to them was inadequate and lacked basic faci lities such as water and sanitati on; however, it is alleged that there have been long delays with these grants. As referred to above, the Government Agent of Colombo has allegedly issued a di rective to all Divisional Secretaries under his authority, stating that all renters and extended families affected by the Tsunami are eligible to receive grants from the Government of Sri Lanka in order to buy la nd and build houses. However, it seems that the directive has not been followed by the Division al Secretary of Moratu wa. Additionally, some community representatives who a llegedly met with the Divisional Secretary were arrested and now allegedly face court proceedings and possible criminal charges becaus e of their attempt to A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 57 advocate on behalf of their community on these is sues. While the action of the authorities to address the plight of victims of the Tsunami is commendable, the alleged facts of the \"de facto\" eviction of families through the discontinuing of basic services in some tr ansitional shelters in the Moratuwa and Ratmalana divisions and the proposed eviction of the others remaining in these transitional shelters may be a matter of c oncern regarding the obligations of Sri Lanka to the right to adequate housing. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested fu rther information if any complaint has been lodged; on details, and where available the resu lts, of any investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other in quiries which may have been carried out in relation to this case; in the event that the alleged perpetrators were identified, full details of any prosecutions that have been undertaken and sanctions that have been impos ed on the alleged perpetrators; and whether compensation has been provided to the vi ctim or the family of the victim.\" Response received 77. On 4 September 2008 the Government of Sri Lanka sent a response to the communication dated 5 August 2008. The Government provided information on the alleged mass forced evictions and demolitions of houses in Kompanna weediya (Slave Island) as well as in the Mahawatha area in Colombo. According to this in formation: \"Some families have been living in unauthorized structures built on government owned re servation lands in Glenic Street and houses in Kompannaweediya (Slave Island) as well as in the Mahawatha area in Colombo. The Urban Development Authority, the Gove rnment body authorized to deal with such issues, issued advance notice on them to vacate the areas. The areas under reference are situated within the High Security Zone in Colombo and the Government has already initiated a project to construct 1,000 houses in Dematagoda, a suburb in Colombo at a cost of Rs 1 million for each dweller of Slave Island and the work is due to be completed by the end of March next year. When these dwellers did not comply with the notice, th e Urban Development Aut hority using the powers vested on it by statute, started to demolish the unauthorized structures, the Urban Development Authority had informed the dwellers of the demo lition of their unauthorized constructions well in advance. According to the Urban Development Authority, these people had given their consent in writing to move to a new place provided by the Government. However, a tense situation occurred when the demolitions began and the Police were compelled to use minimum force to manage the unruly crowds in order to maintain law and order. The dwelle rs had also petitioned the Supreme Court in a fundamental rights case against their eviction from unauthorized lands. The Supreme Court dismissed the petition on 19 August 2008. By this time, all but 21 families had moved into the new place provided by the Government. Following the dismissal of the Fundamental Rights case, the balance occupants in Glennic Street agreed either to accept temporary houses in Totalanga area in Colombo, or receive one year rental fees until the Dematagoda housing complex is ready for occupation. The Urban Development Authority gave more time to the occupants to vacate in view of the forthcoming Ramazan festival. Already 154 families had moved to the temporary shelters at Thotalanga, while 155 families obtained a sum of Rs. 101,000 each including one year's rental of Rs 96,000 plus an allowance of Rs 5,000 provided to transport their belongings.\" Observations 78. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the fina lization of this report, the Government had not transmitted any reply to his communication dated 13 November 2008. A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 58 Sudan Communication sent 79. On 8 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur t ogether with the sp ecial Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on Torture sent a joint allegation letter to the Government of Sudan concerning reports received regarding attacks against the civilian population of the villages Logurony and Iloli in Eastern Equato ria State by the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which resulted in the k illing and beating of ci vilians and destruction of dwellings and livelihoods on 4 June 2008 and in the following days. The villages of Logurony and Iloli, located near Hiyala, in Torit county, Easter n Equatoria State, So uthern Sudan, have a history of occasionally tense re lationships, due primarily to cat tle raiding incidents. At the beginning of June 2008, the Governor of Eastern Equatoria State dispatched the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) to the tw o villages, apparently with or ders to carry out arrests and disarm the population. On 4 June 2008 at around 4 a.m. in the morning, SPLA forces surrounded Logurony. While it was still completely dark, they st arted shooting, at first aiming in the air. The villagers, who were on high alert due to an expected attack from Iloli, returned fire. Only when it became light, they realized that they had killed SPLA soldiers. Fearing retaliation by the SPLA, they fled into the bush. SPLA soldiers shot at Logurony villagers, reportedly killing four: Tome Marcello, the headmaster of police officer; Oreste Ogubung, and Origo Agala. They also started burning down the village. Two elderly people, Ojeno Itak and his wife Amisia Ita k, died in their dwelling during the fire. On 21 June 2008, another elderly woman, Anisa Anohira Oteng, succumbed to the burn injuries sustained at the hospital to which she had b een taken by SPLA soldiers. Also on 4 June 2008, SPLA forces (reportedly counting 300 men) surrounded Iloli. The soldiers took the inhabitants outside the village and then started burning down the villag e, which killed one woman, Abung Elizabeth. The SPLA also arrested five men and tied their hands behind their backs. When news of the SPLA members killed in L ogurony reached Iloli, the SPLA Operational Commander came to Iloli and allegedly ordered the soldiers to execute those arrested. The five men were led back to Iloli. Three men, na med Bertino Odiongo, Angelo Otuno Ogede and Francesco Asai Omudek, were executed on the spot in front of the remaining village community. One of those arrested was injured but managed to escape. The fifth man was beaten by the soldiers and chased away. The population started running towa rds the bush. The SPLA opened fire on them, injuring another man. The bodies of two children, aged 5 and 6 (Ramonok Joseph and Omode Leone), were found in the bush surro unding the village on 9 June 2008, as were the mortal remains of a woman suffering from ep ilepsy (Kelenga Obong), who probably did not survive the stress result ing from her flight. Iloli villag e was burned to the ground. Soldiers gathered the remaining Iloli and Logurony villag ers, approximately one thousand persons, and brought them to the SPLA barracks in Ramshel. Th ere they spent the remainder of the day under the trees. Women were reportedly beaten with sticks. In the ev ening of 4 June 2008 they were released, apparently on orders of the Torit C ounty Commissioner. Twelve male villagers, five from Logurony and seven from Iloli, however remained in SPLA detention until 7 June 2008 (one of them seven days longer). Some were allegedly held in a t ukul, while others were kept in a hole in the ground. All were beaten on their head and stomach with gun barrels and other wooden and iron objects. Two Logur ony detainees sustained severe head injuries, while another had whipping marks on his buttocks. These men did not report the ill-treatment to the police as they feared rearrest by the SPLA. On 10 June 2008, a young man fr om Hiyala was arrested on A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 59 suspicion of involvement in the shooting that led to the death of SPLA soldiers. He was taken to the SPLA barracks and severely beaten. He wa s released following a meetings between the Hiyala Head Chief and the SPLA, and had to be ta ken to Hiyala Hospital for medical treatment. SPLA retaliation against the civi lian population of Logurony, Iloli and Hiyala continued in the days following 4 June 2008. On 6 June 2008, SPLA men shot at Hiyala villagers who were working in the field. A man and a woman were killed (Oronjo Safarino and Odiongo Salvatore), another woman injured. On 7 June 2008, Omudek Al ajut, a man from Iloli, returned to the village, was apprehended by SPLA soldiers, tied up and executed on the spot. On 10 June 2008, Omunong Ohisa Ernaldo and Oreste Ohuro, two L ogurony villagers, were found shot dead near Hiyala village square. These events resulted in major displacement from Iloli and Logurony villages. Approximately 2,800 inhabitants of Lo gurony and approximately 1,500 of Iloli were displaced. Their dwellings were destroyed and they lacked the materials to rebuild them. Moreover, on 4 June 2008, the SPLA seized the cattle belonging to the Iloli and Logurony villages, on which the population relied fo r their livelihood. Additi onally, SPLA soldiers destroyed or took away the solar panels opera ting the Iloli water boreholes. Government representatives from Eastern Equatoria State ha ve visited the area and submitted reports to both the President and Vice-President of the Government of Southe rn Sudan. The Eastern Equatoria State authorities and the Minist ry of SPLA Affairs have announc ed that a high-level Committee will be investigating the incidents. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested furt her information on the authority that decided to entrust the SPLA (instead of the Southern Su dan Police Service) with an operation aimed at ending cattle rustling and other disputes between tw o villages, and the grounds for doing so; information on the orders of engagement of th e SPLA units dispatched to Loguronyi and Iloli; details on the proceedings and results of the investigation by the high-level committee reportedly announced by the Ministry of SPLA Affairs; deta ils of any disciplinary measures imposed on, and criminal prosecutions against persons found to be responsible, as perpetrators or as responsible commanders, for the al leged extrajudicial ex ecutions and rapes of women; details of any measures taken to ensure that complainants , witnesses and family members of the victims are not subject to any intimidation or retaliation; information on measures adopted to ensure that law enforcement forces in Southern Sudan comp ly with the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials; whether any compensation was, or is intended to be, provided to the rape victims and the families of the victims of killings by SPLA forces; and information on the steps taken by your Government to restore adequate housing and access to adequate food and water to th e populations of Logurony and Ilo li and whether any compensation was intended to be provided to the families whose housing was destroyed by the SPLA forces and whose cattle has not been returned. Response received 80. On 12 March 2008, the following information was provided by the authorities of the Sudan to the Special Rapporteur in regard to a number of communications, the last one dated 21 August 2007 related to hydroelectric constructi ons in the area of Merowe and Kajbar: \"I should like to thank the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing for his report and we should like to affirm that the Government of the Sudan respects and earnestly endeavors to ensure the right of every citizen to adequate housing. With regard to the comments on the Merowe Dam and its impact on the inhabitants of the Amri and Ma nasir districts, clearly, the Government of the Sudan has done everything to pay adequate comp ensation to the affected persons, to create alternative agricultural projects for them and to provide then with suitable housing. In this A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 60 connection, the State carried out a general census of the two areas in order to verify the number of families and family members and assess the potential damage to property, such as trees, agricultural harvests and homes. The census wa s carried out in 1999, be fore the preparatory work on construction of the dams began. On the basis of the results, tw o zones were identified that were not very far from the areas that woul d be affected by the construction of the dam basin. Suitable housing was built in special ly constructed villages and supplied with electricity and water services. Moreover, an agricultural projec t was set up and all related project works were completed. In addition, roads, schools, a hospital and health centers were constructed in the villages. In 2006, a second census wa s carried out to quan tify all the additions that citizens had made to their existing property. Lists were issued of persons entitled to compensation and of the compensation amounts, and appeal boards were set up by the Ministry of Justice to hear challenges against compensation decisions. By law, the appeal board s' decisions can be challenged before an arbitration body presided ov er by a judge with a member representing the Department of Dams and another representing th e aggrieved party. After all these procedures were carried out and compensation was paid to the rightful beneficiar ies, the persons were transferred to the new areas, where they settled and began to cultivate their new land. The State bears the cost of all agricultural inputs and faci lities for the land for a pe riod of two years. The State has taken all possible measures to enable the affected individuals to receive compensation and to provide then with housing and agricultu ral land. The situation ha s stabilized and life continues as normal in these villages. As fo r Manasir, an agreement was reached with representatives of the affected population granting the latter the right to choose whether to take up the projects prepared by the Department of Dams or to take the local option requested by some of the affected persons. This is how things stand at present. With regard to the Kajbar Dam, preliminary feasibility studies on the te chnical and economic aspects of the project are being carried out at present. At the same ti me, the authorities are endeavoring to devise satisfactory solutions in consultation with the in habitants of the affected area. The distinguish council cannot be unaware of the considerable importance of the construction of dams for the energy supply and expansion of agriculture and the impact that this will have on economic and social conditions throughout the country. On the other hand, those adversely affected by construction of these dams will not under any circumstances be sacrificed to the public interest. The Stage will consult the affected populations on the amounts of compensation to be awarded and on the areas to which there may be moves. Th e role of the State is to supply all necessary facilities for these areas so that these populat ions can have access to adequate housing and high-quality health, educational and agricultural services.\" Observation 81.

On 29 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government of Turkey regarding the Romani community of the Sulukule neighborhood which allegedly faced the threat of being forcibly evicted due to th e Municipality's urban re habilitation project. The Special Rapporteur thanked the Government of Turkey for the letter sent on 20 October 2006 in response to his communication dated 31 July 2006, related to the situation of the Romani community of the Sulukule mahalles (Neslisah and Hatice Sultan) in the Municipality of Fatih, Istanbul. The Special Rapporteur requested precisions on forced evictions that had been alleged A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 69 in information he received. According to recent information received, the urban rehabilitation project entered its last phase at the end of 2007. The protocol on th e restoration of the Neslisah and Hatice Sultan Districts (Sulukule) in the style of Ottoman arch itecture was signed on 8 June 2006 and revised on 13 June 2007 between the Metropolitan Municipality of Istanbul, the Municipality of Fatih and the Housing Devel opment Administration based on the \"Law on the Protection by Renewal and Use through Survival of Historical and Cultural Immoveable Objects Which are Eroded\" No. 5366 which entered into force in 2005. Article 24 of the regulation introduced for the implementation of Law No. 5366 states that if mutual consent for the evacuation, demolition and nationaliza tion of the buildings located within the renovation zone is not reached, real estate owned by an individual or legal entity can be nationalized by the decision of the authorized administration. Furthermore, the reports state that article 27 of the Nationalization Law No. 2942, provides that in the event of any delay in the renovation project due to the normal nationalization procedures, a speedy nationalization procedure may begin. Moreover, it is alleged that the Council of Ministers can issu e a nationalization decision for \"national defense purpose\" and \"in case of em ergency\". Reportedly, on 13 December 2006, the Council of Ministers authorized the Fatih Muni cipality to proceed with the \"immediate expropriation\" of certain parts in Sulukule. This decision was al legedly taken even before the start of the regular nationalization procedures. Mo reover, it is reported that neither the \"national defense purpose\" nor \"emergency case\" argument are applicable in this situation. Reportedly, a number of houses - among which several were o fficially registered as examples of cultural heritage - was already destroyed by the Municipa lity of Fatih since February 2007. For instance, while a prior notice for evacuation indicated th e date of 31 March 2008, it is reported that on 13 March 2008, seven houses belonging to Romani families were demolished by the Municipality of Fatih. Two of these houses were allegedly still inhabited by the families and as a consequence of their destruction, three Roma ni families comprising approximately 15 people and seven children were made homeless. Additionally, it is alle ged that the concerned persons were not allowed to collect most of their belongings before municipal officials proceeded to destroy their houses. Reportedly, none of these fa milies received any form of compensation or were appropriately relocated. In the first part of the Government of Turkey's response to the Special Rapporteur's previous communication, it was stated that the district of Fatih was located in an earthquake zone which was one of the reasons for the implementation of the renewal project. The Special Rapporteur subsequently received info rmation which states that on 18 December 2007, the Istanbul Chamber of Geology Engineers office delivered a report about the geological situation of Sulukule. Reportedly, the document states that the area of Sulukule is not particularly at a higher risk of earthquakes and that there is no need for specific prevention policies in this respect. Recent information also indicated that during the month of February 2008, Fatih Municipality sent notices to house owners in Sulukule, requesting them to evacuate the houses until the end of March 2008. It is alleged that the ev iction notices did not make any reference to tenant's rights and eventual ways to oppose the evicti on. Additionally, it is reported that house owners we re asked by the Municipality to evict the tenants from their houses otherwise they would lose their right to be nefit from an apartment in the project. It is alleged that this situation has created tensi ons between owners and tenants in Sulukule. Moreover, some house owners have reportedly cu t electricity and water to their tenant's apartments in order to force th em to move out. According to th e latest reports, on 7 March 2008, the Municipality officials started placing \"X \" and \"Y\" signs meaning \"to be demolished\", on houses which were still inhabited. Access to information, participation and consultation processes were also examined by the Special Rapporteur who requested further information. A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 70 Reports received subsequently to the response from the Government of Turkey to the Special Rapporteur's previous co mmunication indicate that the projec t has continued to be developed without consultation and agreement of the affect ed population. The social and economic needs of the people living in the Sulukul e neighborhood were not taken in to consideration during the consultative meetings held between June and Ju ly 2006. It is alleged th at the renewal project does not consider the economic situation of the Roma communities and that, contrary to the authorities' statement, no meaningf ul consultations with the local communities were carried out. It is also alleged that, the communities have not received substantive information about the renewal plans and neither written nor verbal expl anation was given to th e inhabitants about the project. Furthermore, it is reported that the metr opolitan Municipality, the Municipality of Fatih and the Housing Development Administration did not keep the promises they made to the tenants during the public meetings in July 2006. The Special Rapporteur also mentioned housing affordability. Reports indicated that the \"housing project for right holders and tenants living in Neslisah and Hatice Sultan neighourhoods\" was not adapted for the situation of the Romani community. Although the prices of the new houses and the payment conditions would be advantageous compared to the market situation, it seemed that they are still unaffordable for most of the original inhabitants, thus forcing them out of the area. According to recent information, 400 of the 620 houses in the project were sold to people who are not originally from Sulukule district. The remaining 220 homes would be under the threat of expropriation. It was alleged that the Municipality of Fatih puts pressure on people to sell thei r houses, and that those who do not do so, might be expropriated acco rding to Nationalization Law No. 2942 and Law No. 5366. The Special Rapporteur received further information according to which the Housing Development Administration cons tructed public housing in Tasol uk for the tenants and owners of Sulukule in a location situated at 40 kilometers of Sulukule. Accord ing to the information received, in this project, tenant s may become owners of their hous es after a period of 15 years. A census was conducted in order to identify familie s who could benefit from this project, but reportedly, some 300 extremely poor families that are living without paying a rent and who receive the support from the ne ighborhood and the community, were left out. Thereby, it is alleged that those families would not have been counted by the Municipality as right holders for the newly constructed public housing. Additionall y, it is reported that on 4 December 2007, Fatih Municipality organized a lottery in order to attribute some of th e apartments which were built in Tasoluk. Some 200 tenants from Sulukule were re portedly attributed an apartment during this first lottery. It is further alle ged that during the month of Febr uary 2008, those selected in the lottery were called to sign the contracts. Ye t, the banks requested a stamp tax of 800 to 1,300 YTL, and because of financially inability of the tenants to pay the amount, no contracts could be finalized. Other lotteries had been plan ned but have reportedly not taken place at the time of this communication. According to the allegations received, the Special Rapporteur warned that it is likely that the Roma people wi ll suffer from deterior ation of their living conditions, their financial resources, and their access to adequate housing. Moreover, by their relocation and separation into remote apartment blocks, their traditional way of life could be affected and the Romani cultural identity of the Sulukule neighborhood could disappear, if the project is fully implemented. This situation woul d reportedly result in a historical and cultural loss for the entire Romani community given the f act that the area of Sul ukule is considered as one of the oldest Roma community in the world. The Special Rapporteur emphasized two principles of particular importance for the situat ion that is reported above. The first one is the principle of access to informa tion of affected people which implies that individuals and communities have access to appropriate data, docum ents and intellectual resources that impact A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 71 upon their right to obtain adequate housing. Th e second crucial princi ple is the effective participation which means that, at all levels of the decision-making process in respect of the right to adequate housing, individuals a nd communities must be able to express and share their views, they must be consulted and be able to contribut e substantively to such processes that affect housing, including, inter alia, locatio n, spatial dimensions, links to community, social capital and livelihood, housing configuration and other practi cal features. The state must ensure that building and housing laws and policies to not preclude free expressi on, including cultural and religious diversity. In addition to comments on th e accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further informati on on the \"physical and social needs assessment analysis\" as well as their conclusions; on the cr iteria used by the Council of Ministers and the basis of the decision taken on the 13 December 2 007 which authorized the Fatih Municipality to proceed with the \"immediate expropriation\" of certain parts in Sulukule; on how international obligations, in particular on the right to adequate housing, have been considered throughout the legislation and decision process mentioned in this letter; on de bates and conclusions of the consultative meetings held from June to July 2006 and also when and how the affected people were informed of the project, received the eviction notification and what was included in this notification; information about th e alternative housing projects which, accord ing to your letter, had to begin in October 2005 and whether the particular characteristics of the Roma communities were taken into account; regarding the case of the renewal project in Sulukule, information on how the specific economic, soci al and cultural situa tion of the Romani community is addressed by your Government; if the authorities have be en informed of the reported dated 18 December 2007 of the Ista nbul Chamber of Geology Engineers office; information on how did the census of the number of affected person by the project take place and if the census has taken into account all the inha bitants of Sulukule, including the poor families mentioned above; concerning the lotteries for the attribution of the apartments in Tasoluk, how are they carried out and what is the scheduli ng for the next attributions, if the number of construction is inferior to the number of peopl e relocated, what has been foreseen for these people so that they do not fall into homelessness, fu rthermore, if any priority in these attributions have been given to people with pa rticular need (such as single women with children, people with health problems and /or disabilities); con cerning the public housing in Tasoluk, what arrangements are foreseen for people who cannot afford to pay the tax stamp or other related costs requested by the banks for the conclusion of the contract; information on has been foreseen for people who cannot financially afford the new hous es either in Sulukule or in Tasoluk; and what is done to preserve the Romani historical and cultural heritage, mo re specifically, if the aspect of cultural adequacy is part of the renewal project in Sulukule a nd in the public housing in Tasoluk. Response received 87. On the 23 June 2008, the Government of Turkey sent a letter to the Special Rapporteur, in response to the allegation letter dated 29 Apr il 2008. The Government enclosed an Information Note containing the following elements: \"I. General Framewor k on non-discrimination: The main philosophy of Turkey's huma n rights policy can be summarized as \"Human rights for all with no discrimination.\" A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 72 The Republic of Turkey adheres with great dedication to the legacy of tolerance. The constitutional system of Turkey is based on the equality of all individuals without discrimination before the law. Turkish nation is not a juxtaposition of co mmunities or groups. It is composed of citizens, who are equal before the law i rrespective of their origins in terms of language, race, colour, ethnicity, religion or any other such particularity, and whose fundamental rights and freedoms are enjoyed and exercised individually in accordance with the relevant law. Every Turkish citizen is considered an i ndispensable part of the Turkish national identity and culture. Their or igins are the source of ric hness in Turkish society and they can be enjoyed and preserved thr ough the exercise of individual liberties. The reforms conducted in transparency in Turkey are indeed testimony of our resolve to continue to im prove standards of democracy and human rights for the benefit of all our citizens regardless of their origins. Acts of discrimination are pr ohibited and penalized by law. As in any other democratic country govern ed by the rule of law, the independence of judiciary is guaranteed by the Constitu tion in Turkey. Decisions ruled by first instance courts are open to appeal before , at the national level, the Court of Appeals or the Council of State, and, at th e international level, the European court of human rights, the compulsory jurisdiction of which was recognized by Turkey in 1990. No violation has been found by the Eur opean Court of Human rights (ECtHR) on the complaints lodged against Turkey on the grounds of discrimination concerning individuals' origins. All remedies are available against violat ions of fundamental rights and freedoms including acts of discrimination. In addition to the judicial ones, th ere are governmental/administrative and parliamentary remedies. Administrative remedies are utilized through the Human Rights Presidency and Human Rights Boards established in a ll the 81 provinces and 850 sub-provinces throughout the country. The Hu man Rights Inquiry Commi ssion of the Parliament acts as another remedy body at the parliamentary level. These bodies are tasked with investigati ng complaints and allegations of human rights abuses, and submitting their findings to relevant authorities for necessary action. A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 73 Turkey believes that a successful fight against all forms and manifestations of discrimination and intolerance require s combined efforts at national and international levels. With this understanding, Turkey is party to all relevant inte rnational instruments both at global (UN) and regional (Council of Europe and OSCE) for a, and duly maintains a close and cons tructive cooperation with th e special mechanisms of these organizations tasked with the fight against intolerance and discrimination. II. The Renewal Project in the District of Fatih Sulukule is a small part of Neslisah District. This ar ea corresponds to only 20% of the whole renewal project area, which is approximately 90.000 m2 in total. All the right holders in the project area are treated in a fair, transparent and equal manner. On the 19 October 2005, the Municipality of Fatih declared Neslisah and Hatice Sultan Districts as \"renewal area\" pursuant to the \"Law on the Protection by Renewal and Use through Survival of Hist orical and Cultural Immoveable Objects which are eroded\" No. 5366. This deci sion was endorsed by the Metropolitan Municipality of Istanbul on 9 January 2006 (Decision No. 26) and was conveyed to the Council of Ministers for approval. The declaration of project renewal area subsequently came into effect following the approval by the C ouncil of Ministers on 3 April 2006 (Decree No. 2006/10299 and the President, which was promulgated in the Official Gazette of 13 December 2006. On 13 July 2006 the \"Protocol on th e Project and Works for the 1st Group No. 2 Renewal Areas of Fatih District in Istanbul\" was signed between the Housing Development Administration, the Municipality of Fa tih and the Metropolitan Municipality of Istanbul. The purpose of th e Protocol is to clear the slump areas formed due to the prevalence of ruine d, broken-down and squatter settlements with low urban standards as well as slums within the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Fatih with a view to establishing a urban area with modern standards, while preserving its historical formation. The Protocol also envisages a consensual settlement of possible conflicts which may arise with the right holders in the renewal area. Mutual consent in the renewal area is th e main principle. In the event that an agreement cannot be reached and the re gular expropriation process would delay the implementation of the project, aut horization may be granted for a \"speedy expropriation\" according to the domestic legislation. This procedure is not limited to situations of \"national defen ce\" and \"case of emergency\" under the Expropriation Act No. 2942. Indeed, Article 27 of the Act No. 2942 allows for speedy expropriation in \"extraordinary circ umstances foreseen in special laws\". Law No. 5366 is a special law which is a pplicable in the ca se of the renewal project for Nelisah and Hatice Sultan Distri cts. Paragraph 4 of Article 24 of the Regulation on the implementation of the La w No. 5366 states that \"in cases which the regular expropriation process will delay the implement ation of the project (and an agreement cannot be reached with th e right holder), speedy expropriation may A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 74 be authorized under Article 27 of the Act No. 2942.\" In this regard, such an expropriation procedure was authoriz ed by the Council of Ministers on the 19 October 2006 (Decree No. 11296), which was promulgated in the Official Gazette dated 13 December 2006 following the approval of the President. However, this decision has not been enfor ced due to the suits of nullity initiated before the administrative courts. So far, it has been possible to reach a mutual agreement with 520 owners out of 620 a nd with all the tenants (340 persons in total) living in the renewal area. Wher eas, verbal contract s have also been concluded with the rest of the owners due to the fact that settlements of inheritance and transfer claims are bei ng awaited in order to proceed with the written contracts. The right holders who sign contracts submit a petition for demolition (Annex 1) after they evacuate the property so that it is not occupied by others. Such properties are checked (in situ ) whether it is inhabited or not. If the property is inhabited by people, then th eir status is determined in order to find out whether they are occupiers or tenants. If they are tenants, who have previously claimed accommodation in the apartments bei ng built in Tasoluk, then they are opportunity to live in the property until th eir evacuation. If the tenant has not claimed accommodation as such, then he or she is allowed to stay in the property until the schools are closed (Annex 2). Unfortunately, illegal occupiers have managed to move into some of the evacuated houses. Legal proceedings have been initiated against such occupiers and in some instances the demolition work has been carried out under article 3 of the Law No. 5366 as a priority. The local people have lodged complaints against such illegal occupiers. No registered , listed or qualified property has been demolished in the area; On the contrary, one of the purposes of the project is to preserve the registered and qualified histor ical and cultural properties in the area. The whole district of Fatih is under the earthquake risk of first degree. An earthquake map of Istanbul will be provi ded to the Special Rapporteur in due course. The region is particularly vulnerabl e since almost all the premises are old, ruined and shabby. Prior to the project, an assessment study was undertaken, as a result of which is was established that 439 buildings were heap, 75 reinforced concrete, 56 wooden and 4 other types of construction such as heap and wooden. 410 buildings were in very bad shape, 3 in good shape, 155 medium, 5 ruined and 1 torn down. Most of there constructi ons have completed their economic and durability like due to lack of proper care, carry a certain degree of risk. A notice for evacuation was sent to the ri ght holders in the region. However, the evacuation period was extended until the schoo ls were closed and the tenants were transferred to new houses. No complaint ha s been received during this process. The relationship between the property owne rs and tenant is beyond the authority of the Municipality of Fatih. If a complaint is lo dged with the Municipality concerning disputes arising from the owner-tenant relationship, the authorities can only offer good offices for the resolution of such disputes. All the owners and tenants are entitled to housing within the framework of the project. In this vein, A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 75 conclusion of agreements with the right holders has entered into its last phase. Furthermore, the demolition work can only take place once the right holders submit their petitions for demolition to the municipal authorities. After the region was declared as \"renewal area\", consultations with the right holders in the region were organized two times a week for a period of two months. During the process, the expectations, requests, suggestions and cl aims of the right holders were duly identified and th e project was developed accordingly. Consultations with local people continue d during the development phase of the project, thereby, allowing necessary adjust ments and revisions to be made in the project. In June and July 2006, consultativ e meetings with the right holders were organized in the premises if the Muni cipality of Fatih. Furthermore, the Directorate of Research Project of the Municipality of Fatih continued to have regular briefings and exchanges with th e right holders from September 2006 to September 2007. The owners are provided with new houses within the project area, whereas tenants are entitled to new apartment flats in other parts of Istanbul. Both the owners and tenants receive monthly financial aid until the project is completed. (The list of the beneficiaries can be provided to the Special Rapporteur, if needed.) The project does not reflect the needs and expectations of only one specific group. It was developed on the basis of the gene ral expectations and preferences of the local people. The project houses are two- storey buildings with open internal courtyards paved with stones. This style of construction is based on the preference of the Romani community. The prices of the houses were paid to the owners in advance. As for the remaining debt, in cases which the price of the new housed exceed that of their old properties, the right holders have been provided with flexible payment conditions. They are expected to begin their monthly payment (for a period of 180 month term), once they move to their new houses. On the other hand, if the owner is credited then he or she receives full payment in advance. The prices of project houses were determined according to the price of the existing immoveable property plus the cost price of the construction. For instance, the price of a 100m2 house is 90,000 YTL (approximately 73,530 US Dollars). The price of the new project house, whic h the owner will be provided in return, would be 125,000 YTL (approximately 102,124 US Dollars). The remaining amount, which the owner is expected to be gin paying once he or she moves to the new house, would be 35,000 YTL (approximately 28,594 US Dollars). Its monthly payment corresponds to 195 YTL (approximately 159 US Dollars). The rental income from the old house ranges from 250 to 300 YTL per month (204-245 US Dollars), while the project houses will produce a monthly income of 1000 to 1500 YTL (approximately 817 to 1225 US Dollars). Therefore, the right holders expect the project to be comple ted as soon as possible. The right to ownership is safeguarded in the Constitution. There is no obstacle for right holders to transfer their pr operties and to purchase new ones. So far, transfer of ownership within the framew ork of the project has not been on a large scale as A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 76 suggested in the communication of the Sp ecial Rapporteur. Indeed, the recent data from the Directorate for Registry of T itle Deeds shows that the transfer of ownership in the area is only %30 to date. Most of them were indeed hereditary transmissions. Prior to the project, the Municipality of Fatih instructed the Un iversity of Istanbul to conduct a census in order to prepar e a comprehensive assessment on the physical, social, cultural, demographic, economic and settlement conditions in the area. According to the findings of the census, the number of families living as tenants in the project area was establishe d as 303. However, it was later found out that some of the tenants were not at home when the survey was conducted. In order not to exclude there pe ople from the project, this process was extended until the end of 2007. The new deadline was repeatedly announced by the local authorities. Therefore, the number of te nants has risen to 340 according to the extended assessment. All of them had the opportunity to partic ipate in the housing lotteries that were conducted in the pres ence of a notary public. The local families who had the status of tenants and occupier s when the project began in the renewal area, are entitled to housing attribution within the fram ework of the project. No family with such a status has been excl uded from the project. It has been recently decided that those families who are able to prove that they were tenants when the project began are now recognized as ha ving entitled to tenancy rights. The housing attribution contracts with the tenants are indeed free of charge. After the lotteries were organized, a total of 8 te nants applied to the bank instead of the Municipality of Fatih in order to sign c ontracts. They were re quested to pay stamp tax by the banks for this transaction. The Municipality of Fatih immediately intervened after this situation was br ought to its attenti on. Therefore, the Municipality once again announced to the lo cal people that the contracts were to be signed with the municipal authorities a nd not with the banks. So far contracts have been concluded with almost all the tenants for the attribution of apartments in Tasoluk district. These apartment flats have been allocated to tenants without any prepayment. They are expected to be gin their monthly payments (for a term of 180 months, corresponding to 15 years) once they move to their new flats. This project is designed to meet the e xpectations of the local people for better living standards and will contribute to their physical, socio-economic and cultural development. The project aims to preserve the historical stre et silhouette and is consistent with the local living tradi tions. The Romani community constitutes only a part of the population living as tena nts in the renewal area. Most of the tenants come from different parts of the country to work in textile and service sectors with low income. However, th e special situation of the Romani community has been given due attention at all stages of the project. The houses allocated to tenants are not in separate regions. They are in the same area and made up of 3 storey apartments with 6 flats each, constructed side by side with separately organized blocks. The to tal area is 7000,000 m 2, 250,000 m2 of which is allocated to buildings. The remaining part is composed of green area and social, educational, cultural and recreational common parts. A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 77 The project was developed on the basis of physical and social needs assessments. Some of these assessment reports will be provided to the Special Rapporteur in due course. The decision of the council of Minist ers for expropriation has never been implemented. As such, no expropriation work has been carried out to date. No family has been forced to evacuate their pr operties. So far, only the properties of those families who have submitted petition to the Municipality after their evacuation have been demolished. The projec t has been carried out pursuant to the decisions agreed upon during the consulta tive meetings held in June-July 2006. The public housing in Tasoluk district includes all tenants and occupant families in the renewal area. The attribution of the apartments to 340 families has been completed. The Municipality of Fatih has concluded an agreement with the Housing Development Administration for further the attribution of 100 houses in order to meet a possible accommodation defi cit. The contracts signed between the right holders and the Municipality of Fatih are free of charge. The project is not only designed as a re newal project but al so includes social empowerment programmes. For instance, 45 local women are provided with opportunity to attend an occupational certificate programme on clothing and tailoring, with business guarantees. A nother certificate programme on wooden works for 20 young locals will begin shortl y. All participants are insured and receive daily wages during their courses. A third initiative is a vocational course organized in cooperation with \"Istanbul Ready-Made Clothing Business Union\". Efforts are being made to ensure employment opportunities after the completion of this course. Furthermore, an appli cation for an employment grant programme has been submitted to the European Union and Turkish Employment Organization (ISKUR).\" United States of America Communication sent 88. On 17 December 2007 the Special Rapporteur together with the Independent Expert on Minority Issues sent a joint urge nt appeal to the Government of the United States of America concerning information received regarding de molitions of public housing in New Orleans, Louisiana, which are scheduled to take pl ace in Mid-December. Such demolitions would reportedly particularly affect African-Ameri cans. According to the information received, approximately 5000 families who previous to Hu rricane Katrina lived in public housing in New Orleans, were, as a result, internally displaced and were still waiting to be able to return to their homes in New Orleans. Reports indicate d, however, that in their absence the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Developmen t (HUD) approved the demolition of thousands of public housing units, allowing only approxima tely 1,500 families to return to New Orleans public housing. Specifically, on 14 June 2006, HUD announced that it would demolish more than 5,000 public housing units and replace them with mixed-income developments. HUD has moreover shortened the 100-day review period for demolition to one day. Demolition mainly concerns St. Bernard, C.J. Peete, B.W. Cooper, and Lafitte estates. These demolitions were allegedly scheduled to take plac e despite the fact that an inde pendent survey to assess the A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 78 number of displaced residents of New Orleans who wish to return had not yet been completed. In addition, expert testimony reporte dly contradicted housing official s in declaring that the housing units are structurally unsound. It has moreover b een indicated that the demolition plans did not consider a one for one replacement of housing, and residents of the public housing concerned were not allowed to meaningfully particip ate in the decisions affecting their housing. Furthermore, the Gulf Coast Housing Recovery Act of 2007, which would provide all residents of the Gulf Coast the right to return and specifi cally identifies this right for previous public housing residents, was still pending before th e Senate, and the above-mentioned demolitions were scheduled to take place before the Senate wa s able to vote on this legislation. Finally, in preparation for the demolition, reports described that contra ctors have begun clearing the properties concerned, discarding th e personal property of the resi dents in the process, without their knowledge or consent. The position of thos e residents who are curre ntly living in such housing was, at the time of this communica tion, unclear. These actions would reportedly contravene \u00a7 1437p of the United States Hous ing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437p) and the Administrative Procedure Act, which, among othe r things, prohibit approval of a public housing demolition application if the application was not developed in consultation with the residents who will be affected by the demolition and with each affected resident advisory board or resident council. These Acts further provide that, as a prer equisite to approval, th e local housing authority must, inter alia, certify that the public housing development is: (1) obsolete and unsuitable for housing purposes and that no cost-effective plan can allow the buildings to be used for housing purposes; and (2) that each family will be notified of the demolition and offered comparable housing that meets housing quality standards and is allocated in an area that is generally not less desirable than the location of the displaced. Concern was expressed the demolition of over 5,000 units of public housing, if implemented, would eff ectively deny the right to return, the right to housing restitution of IDPs, and the right to ad equate housing of thousands of, particularly, African-American residents of Ne w Orleans. Further concern was expressed from the point of view of non-discrimination, particularly since report s indicate that efforts to respect, protect and fulfil these rights for predominantly White reside nts of New Orleans have been undertaken. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on whether tenants are informed a bout their legal rights and any steps taken to ensure their protection including legal aid for those with low-incomes; if all alternative solutions to resettlement of the persons affected by the scheduled demolitions are envisaged; in cases where relocat ion is unavoidable, whether it is ensured that the scheduled demolitions do not result in homelessness and ade quate and fair compensation and rehabilitation is provided; and information on the measures take n to avoid any form of discrimination towards the African-American residents of New Orleans in relation to this matter. Observation 89. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the fina lization of this report, the Government had not transmitted a ny reply to this communication. Uzbekistan Communication sent 90. On 13 March 2008, the Special Rap porteur together with the Sp ecial Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent a joint allegation letter to the A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 79 Government of Uzbekistan in relation to Ms Saida Kurbanova, director of the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU), a non-governmental organization in the Pakhtakor district of the Jizak region. She is also a farmer and a campa igner for farmers' rights. Since 24 February 2008, Ms Saida Kurbanova had reportedly been under threat of eviction from her home as a result of her organization of, and participatio n in, a series of peaceful protes ts in the past two months to protest against the lack of dome stic heating and electricity in the Jizak region. Reports indicated that Saida Kurbanova has been under pressure fr om local authorities to leave the region. The head of the Pahtakor District Administration, has re portedly threatened her relatives, Kabul Sattarov and Murad Hujamuradov, that they will lose their farms if she refuses to leave the Jizak region. Saida Kurbanova reportedly was also subj ect to constant surveillance by unidentified persons in plain clothes and on 22 February 2008, she was attacked by a young man who stole her bag. In May 2007, Saida Kurbanova was subject to a smear campaign by regional media as a result of her work and was calle d a \"traitor of the motherland\" by Ergash Soliyev, the head of the Pahtakor District Administration, for internati onally publicizing the plight of Uzbek farmers. This winter, farmers and citizen s in Uzbekistan have suffered gas shortages amidst freezing temperatures. Concern was expressed that the harassment and intimidation faced by Ms. Saida Kurbanova may be directly related to her activities in defense of human rights, in particular the work carried out by the HRSU in defense of the ri ghts of farmers in Uzbekistan. Further concern was expressed for the physical an d psychological integrit y of Saida Kurbanova, that of her family and all members of the HRSU. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information if any complaint has been lodged; details, and where available the results, of any investig ation and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the harass ment and intimidation of Ms. Saida Kurbanova; and information on the m easures taken to ensure the safety of Ms. Saida Kurbanova. Response received 91. On 22 April 2008 the Government of Uzbekistan replied to the joint allegation letter dated 13 March 2008, and gave the following informati on on the case of S. Kurbanova: \"In the course of the investigation carried out by Uzbekistan's competent authorities, it was established that neither Ms. Saida Kurbanova, born 31 Decem ber 1958 and residing at 7 Safarov Street, \"Navbakhor\" rural area, Pakhtakor municipal district of Dzhizak [Jizzax] province, nor members of her family, were threatened with expulsion from their homes. They did not appeal to the Office of the Procurat or on that subject. 92. Nor did Ms. Kurbanova appeal to the local authorities concerning the lack of electric power and natural gas in Pakht akor district during the wi nter of 2007-2008. However, the Dzhizak [Jizzax] municipal internal affairs office is carrying out a preliminary investigation into S. Kurbanova's report that she was attacked on 22 February 2008 and robbed of 49,200 Uzbek sum and other items, and on the basis of the findi ngs, a decision will be taken in accordance with the law. There has likewise been no corroboratio n of the information concerning threats by local administrative and law enforcement officials to Ms. Kurbanova's relativ es, Kabul Sattarov and Murad Khuzhamuradov, that they would lose thei r farms if Ms. Kurbanova refused to leave Dzhizak [Jizzax] province. In view of the foregoing, the information brought to the attention of the United Nations Special Rapporteurs concerning alleged violations of Ms. Kurbanova's rights A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 80 by local authorities and law enforcement agenci es in connection with her participation in peaceful protests during which she spoke out agains t the lack of heating and electricity in the Dzhizak [Jizzax] province during the winter is groundless.\" Zimbabwe Communication sent 93. On 22 April 2008 the Special Rapporteur togeth er with the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and c onsequences, the Special Rappor teur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the promoti on and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on Torture sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of Zimb abwe regarding reports of intimid ation, violence and torture as a form of retribution or victimization in the aftermath of recent electi ons. Between 29 March and 14 April 2008, 160 cases of injury resulting from organized violence and to rture were treated by various doctors with many of the patients still remaining in hospital. One third of the patients were women. A fifth of the victims were memb ers of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and another 20% were involved in the elections for the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC). Nine patients sustained fractures (broken bones), reportedly typical of \"defense injuries\", resulting from the victim raising his or her hands and arms to protect the face and upper body from assault. At least two pol itically motivated murders, 15 abductions of women, 288 cases of homes destroyed through politically motivated arson subjecting 175 families and 14 persons to displacement, and 48 cases of assault took place during this period. The majority of persons displaced are said to be women and childre n. About 70 MDC members have been arrested in the days leading up to this communicati on. The above-described violence has been perpetrated by police officers, soldiers and me mbers of the ruling Zanu PF party as part of a retributive and reprisal campaign mainly in rural areas, where people have voted for opposition candidates. In many instances victims we re told that they were being victimized because they support the opposition; they were accused of \"celebrating the MDC victory\", \"of selling the country to the whites\" and/or \"of be ing responsible for the ri gging of elections in favour of the MDC\". Reports also indicate that th e authorities are targeting the independent local and foreign media, attempting to impede reporting on the current situation and the aftermath of the election, by resorting increasingly to poli ce harassment and the arrest and detention of journalists; the deportation of one foreign journalist has been reported. In parallel, the State-controlled media is reportedly airing programmes and songs encouraging violence, such as \"Mr. Government\" by Man Soul Jah, which celebrates the Government's land seizures and calls for the decimation of perceived pol itical sell-outs (the song says: \"We are livi ng like squatters in the land of our heritage... give me my spear so that I can kill the many sell-outs in my forefathers' country.\") and a we ll known song encouraging people to take up arms and fight for their freedom aired by ZTV. Moreover, reports have appeared that there are plans to entrust the distribution of food aid to the military in order to control the population through the politicization of food distributi on. In addition to comments on th e accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested fu rther information if any complaint has been lodged by or on behalf of the alle ged victims; details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case; full details of any prosecutions which ha ve been or will be undertaken and sanctions imposed on any of the alleged perpetrators; a nd whether compensation has been or will be provided to the alleged victims or their families. A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 81 Response received 94. On 11 June 2008, the Government of Zimbabwe responded to the communication dated 22 April 2008, informing the Specials Rapporteurs that the President, Cabinet Ministers, Service Chiefs and various ruling party functionaries have all repeated ly before, during and after the 29th March Harmonised Elections, p ublicly declared their disappr oval for violence and warned all would be perpetrato rs of the full consequences of the law. The government gave the following information in response to the Special Rapporteurs allegation letter: 95. \"On the eve of the election, Police Commi ssioner General Augustine Chihuri, flanked by his fellow Service Chiefs, issued his most st ern warning against violence. A copy of this statement is at Annexure D. This policy has been and continues to be enforced without discrimination, fear or favour. All cases that have been reported to the po lice are the subject of investigations as part of the due processes of the law. In Zimbabwe, a report by an aggrieved party or reasonable suspicion of a crime having been committed or about to be committed is a critical step in launching this due process of the law. Once reported, the ZRP would then exercise its mandate to docket, investigate and bring suspects before the courts of law for prosecution and, ultimately, judgment. Where no repor t has been made to the police, as appears to be the case regarding the 31 politically motivated murders claimed by the MDC-T as having occurred since 29th March 2008, the Police would fi nd it impossible to take the initial steps to launch the due process described above, bearing in mind that at Zimbabwean law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The eight murd ers officially attributed to the two sides fall far below the 31 claimed by MDC-T. It is impossible to verify the MDC-T's claims, particularly because it appears to be complaining to the press befo re reporting them to the police. Even then, of the six murders allegedly committed by ZANU-PF supporters, subject to ongoing investigations, at least two do not seem to have been politically motivated. One of these was the case of Clemence Dube, who MDC-T's Antony Chamisa claimed to have been murdered in Shurugwi by a ZANU-PF supporter on 27 April 2008. A ccording to established facts, however, Dube died of immunosuppression and tuberculosis at Mpilo Hospital, in Bulawayo, on 27 April 2008. Incidentally, on 11 April 2008, he had fought with a ZANU-PF supporter at a local township over money, but eye witnesses say the two later went their separate ways. In the other case, the alleged victim, a teacher in Muzara bani area, has turned ou t to be alive. He has actually denounced the MDC-T for us ing his name to justify 'dubious statistics'. It seems, from these two cases alone, that the MDC-T is fabricating and exagge rating its tally of victims in order to give substance to its claims that there is a raging civil war in Zimbabwe. Some of the alleged crimes in the MDC-T's tally, such as pol itically motivated rape, are completely alien and unheard of in Zimbabwe's political culture. However, every complaint received will be investigated and pursued to its logical conclusion, with all perpetrators facing the full wrath of the law. It has never been Government's policy to support or condone violen ce or impunity. It is unfortunate that, quite to the c ontrary of the objectiv e reality on the ground , all the 'evidence' cited by the Rapporteurs paints the MDC-T as the victim and implicates ZANU-PF as the principal perpetrator of violence. During the 'mass action' called by the MDC-T on 15th March 2008, marauding gangs of MDC-T DRCs burnt to ashes one c onventional 77-seater bus belonging to the Nyamweda Bus Company which was full of cross-border traders en route from Botswana, stoned another bus belonging to the state-owned Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (ZUPCO) and two private motor vehicles , and also committed a wide range of other crimes ranging from disrupting traffic through ma keshift road blockades to attempted murder. Police arrested 76 activists who have all confessed to be hired members of the DRCs. As a result A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 page 82 of the ongoing investigations pertaining to Electo ral Fraud, close to 100 arrests have been made. Five of these have already been convicted fo r Contravening Section 87 of the Electoral Act Chapter 2: 13 and sentenced to fines rangi ng between ZW$12 billion and ZW$30 billion. The remaining cases are either at various stages of investigation or before the courts. This is not victimization of 'human rights defenders' as th e MDC-T claims. No one is above the law in Zimbabwe. Where a crime is suspected to have been committed, the perpetrator will be brought to justice regardless of his or her race, colour, religion or po litical affiliation. This principle demands that the law must be allowed to take its course. Much as some quarters may advocate the invocation of the 'responsibil ity to protect' principle agains t Zimbabwe on the basis of the MDC-T's litany of fabrications a nd exaggerations, it is equally im portant to understand that the Constitution of Zimbabwe demarcates the sovere ign boundaries of responsibility within which the Government must protect it s citizens. Regarding questions of compensation for alleged victims which are also raised in the communi cation, victims are receiving the usual basic assistance from the Civil Protecti on Department and the resident humanitarian agencies in the country. However, contrary to the over 5 000 \"IDP s\" that the MDC-T claims to have registered, the Government, with the support of non-partisan civil society, are attending to no more than 100 households comprising 700 people. Ther e are no new cases. Besides, it is still too early to start talking about long-term resettlement support at this stage when the problem is still being quantified, the victims screened and regi stered "}
