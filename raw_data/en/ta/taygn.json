The ancient principles of Ayurveda, or the 'Science of Life', are rooted in the idea that everything is interconnected: we cannot separate our body from our mind, and we cannot separate ourselves from the world we live in. The concepts of interconnectedness and balance underpin all Ayurvedic thinking. According to Ayurveda, our natural state is one of health, happiness and an inner sense of wellbeing. 'Health' is defined as the body being clear of toxins, the mind at peace, our emotions balanced, our wastes eliminated and our organs functioning normally. Imbalances cause ill-health and make us more susceptible to disease. Maintaining health and preventing disease while coping with the hectic, often toxic world we live in is challenging, but by following the natural cycles and rhythms of the seasons and our own bodies, we can find balance and optimize our wellbeing. Detoxing - essentially removing excess waste - is one of the most important ways we can attain balance and the comfort and wellbeing that go with it. In this book you will learn how to understand your own constitution and use the daily and seasonal cycles of nature to discard waste and toxic build up. You will discover how to boost your own ability to self-regulate based on your specific body type, or in Sankskrit, 'dosha'. With easy-to-follow instructions to help you detox safely at home, Ayurveda Detox is a comprehensive guide filled with plans, routines, recipes and home remedies, to help you achieve your natural state of health and happiness.
