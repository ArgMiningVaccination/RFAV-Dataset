One side of the store had sports nutrition products loaded with artificial ingredients and dangerous stimulants, the other side had supplements that improved health but not fitness. I wanted both. That's why I created Clean Machine\u00ae. I dedicated my entire career to finding the best ingredients for our bodies to promote both health and fitness. This led me to a patent for my invention of the first supplement that mirrored the amino acid ratio of human muscle tissue. I then created the first Heat Shock Protein sports nutrition product. And with the creation of Clean Machine\u00ae all of our products have been recognized for awards every year since 2013, culminating in winning the NEXTY Award for Best New Supplement in 2018 for Clean Green Protein. But what I love most is that every day Clean Machine's products are improving the lives of others while being sustainable and 100% plant-based. Better for health, fitness, the environment and the all life we share this planet with. That's a whole lot of good.
