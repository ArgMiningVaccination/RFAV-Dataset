[Schedule Your Session ](https://pranaharmony.as.me/) Reiki Therapy The word Reiki is made of two Japanese words - Rei means \"divine wisdom\" or \"the Higher Power\" and Ki is \"life force energy\". So Reiki is actually \"spiritually guided life force energy.\" Reiki is a Japanese technique for reducing stress, promoting healing, and relaxation. It is referred to as palm healing or hands-on healing and is based on the idea that an unseen \"life force energy\" flows through us. If our \"life force energy\" is low, we are more likely to get sick or feel stress. Reiki is a simple, natural method of spiritual healing and self-improvement. Reiki balances the human energy fields and assists in aligning your Chakras. The Reiki practitioner assists clients to heal themselves spiritually, mentally, emotionally and physically. Using Healing Symbols, the Reiki practitioner channels the Universal Life Force energy allowing it to flow where it is needed to bring the energy centers into alignment. Pranic Energy Healing Prana is the Sanskrit word for Lifeforce. It is called 'chi' in China and 'ki' in Japan. Pranic Healing (Energy Healing) is a revolutionary and comprehensive system of natural healing techniques that uses prana to treat illness. It is a synthesis of ancient, esoteric healing methods that have been rediscovered, researched, and tested over decades with proven success. Which is reincarnated by the founder of Modern Pranic Healing, Grand Master Choa Kok Sui. Science explains to us that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can be transformed from one form to another. Think about what this could mean to you? If you can understand how to work with energy, it can help transform all the negative results in your life into positive results - sickness into well-being, lack into abundance, stress into the peace of mind, and failing relationships into healthy, strong bonds. Energy Healing uses energy, there is a lot more to it than just the healing part. It not only makes you aware of the aura around the human body - the 'chakras' (energy centers) and their effects on our health and well-being.

Mother Nature heals us with different crystals to help us heal, energize and protect. Crystals heal our mind, body, and emotions. We need Crystals to bring balance in Nature. Energy healing with Crystals involves deep cleansing and energizing the Chakras (there are 108 Energy Centers) in your body.
