Pharmacology, Sh antou University Medical College, Shantou, China Chapter 1 8 The liver is the largest internal organ involv ed in metabolism and detoxification in humans. It metabolizes and stores nutrie nts (protein, glycogen, vitamins, lipids, cholesterol), it is responsible for the synthe sis of bile acids from cholesterol and the synthesis of many plasma proteins and it detoxifies xenobiotics, such as drugs and alcohol [1, 2]. These activities can be gr ouped into (a) synthetic functions, (b) metabolic functions, (c) detoxification. No t surprisingly, impairment of the normal function of the liver can lead to serious disruption of homeostasis and liver diseases are therefore characterized by high morbid ity and mortality. In traditional Chinese medicine, the heart is considered the 'Kin g' or 'Supreme Commander' over body functions, whereas the liver is considered as the 'General' or 'Long-range Planner'. These terms are paralleled in Western physiology, e.g. the liver plays a critical role in maintaining body energy ('Qi') and the bala nce between 'Yin' and 'Yang' [3, 4]. The 'planning' capacity of the liver can be translated to maintaining blood quality (detoxification, plasma protein synt hesis), digestion and metabolism of carbohydrates (glucose), and storage of important nutrients (vitamins, lipids, glycogen). Sometimes it is difficult to translate the terminology from Chinese traditional medicine to Western physiolo gy. In traditional Chinese medicine, the liver 'has its opening in the eyes'. In ' Neijing' , it is stated 'liver qi communicates with the eyes', suggesting that the eyes are clos ely linked to the liver [5]. This could be related to the fact that the eyes are nourish ed by liver (blood) and that the liver is the storage organ for vitamin A, a crucial vita min in vision, e.g. vitamin A deficiency leads to (night) blindness. Furthermore, the eye is an indicator for liver function: yellow colorization of the eyes may refl ect jaundice. Additionally, according to traditional Chinese medicine, the liver pl ays a central role in harmonizing the emotional flow and governing mental and sp iritual functions [6]. Likewise, intense emotions like chronic rage, complaining, despair, jealousy often adversely affects liver function. Thus, a healthy liver is indi spensable for normal body function, both from the Western and the Eastern perspective. In humans, the liver is composed of two liver lobes and has a dual blood supply: oxygen-rich blood is supplied by the hepatic artery that accounts for 25% of the liver blood supply, whereas 75% of the blood su pply comes from the gut via the portal vein [7]. The blood from the portal vein contains nutrients absorbed from the intestinal lumen, but also potentially harmfu l substances absorbed from the gut, e.g. toxins, pathogens, xenobiotics and gut-deri ved endotoxins. The liver is therefore the first organ exposed to toxic substances from the gut and therefore susceptible to damage induced by these noxious comp ounds. Fortunately, the liver is well-equipped to deal with these chal lenges: the liver is the primary site of detoxification of many toxic compound s and the clearance of pathogens and gut-derived endotoxins. Furthermore, the li ver has a remarkable capacity to adapt and withstand various forms of injury thro ugh regenerative repair. The equilibrium between cell death, proliferation and differe ntiation is crucial for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis throughout life. Within th e liver, various phenotypically distinct cell types are responsible for the maintenanc e of this delicate equilibrium. These cell Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 9 types include parenchymal cells (mainl y hepatocytes and stellate cells, Kupffer cells and lymphocytes (Fig. 1). Figure 1. The location and structure of various cell type s in the liver, which contains hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, and cells, NK and NKT cells, hepatic dendritic cells (DCs). Some of cells participate in inflammatory and immune responses. Reprinted with permission from Steven E. Shoelson \u00a9 2006 American Society for Clinical Investigation [8] . First, we introduce these cell types and their functions in the liver. Parenchymal cells (hepatoc ytes and cholangiocytes) Within the liver there are two types of po larized epithelial cells: hepatocytes and cholangiocytes (also known as biliary epit helial cells). In terms of mass and number, the hepatocyte is the predominant liver cell type, comprising around 70% of the total number of cells in the liver and approximat ely 80% of the total liver mass [2, 9, 10]. Cholangiocytes line the bile ducts and modu bile [11]. Both cell types, hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, are cruc ial for liver function and homeostasis. Damage to one of these cell types is the cause of most liver diseases leading to inflammation and fibrosis [12]. The hepatocytes are responsible for many liver-specific functions, such as intermed iary metabolism, detoxification of toxic compounds, synthesis of bile acids and many plasma proteins, and generation of bile acid-dependent bile flow. In the healthy liver, very few of the hepatocytes are progressing through the cell cycle, the vast majority remains in a quiescent state (G0) [13]. However, hepatocytes retain the ability to re-enter the cell cycle in response to a liver insult, e.g. after partial resection of th e liver [14] or severe liver injury [15]. In most liver diseases, in particular inflammatory liver diseases, it are mostly the hepatocytes that perish. Loss of hepatocytes occurs by cell death. The major types of cell death are apoptosis and necrosis alth ough alternative form s of cell death also occur, e.g. autophagy. Although apoptosis an d necrosis have clear definitions, it is 1 Chapter 1 10 increasingly recognized that they repres ent two extremes of a continuum. Indeed, intermediate forms of cell death like necro-apoptosis (necroptosis) displaying features of both apoptosis and necrosis have been described [16]. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is characterized by cell shrinking, membrane blebbing, DNA condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and fi nally the formation of apoptotic bodies. Mitochondrial morphology remains intact and the cellular content remains confined and does not spill into the circulation [17, 18]. The morphological events are accompanied by the activation of specific pr oteases, called caspases, in particular the downstream effector caspases-3, -6 and -7, which cleave cellular structures and proteins resulting in cell death. In contra st, necrosis, or 'passive' cell death, is characterized by cell swelling, rupture of the plasma membrane with subsequent spilling of cellular content into the ci rculation, resulting in inflammation and mitochondrial swelling. Nuclear morphology remains intact [19]. Autophagy, or cellular self-digestion (Greek for \"self-e ating\"), is cell death mediated by the lysosomal degradation of cellular compon ents. exact ca usal role of autophagy to liver damage is not clear. For example, autophagy could act both as an agonist and as an antagonist of cell death depending on the experiment al context. Although apoptosis is crucial for embryonic development and normal tissue homeostasis, including liver homeostasis, excessive apoptosis in liver di seases is detrimental. The predominant mode of hepatocyte cell death is dependent on the liver disease, e.g. necrotic cell death is the predominant mode of cell death in acute acetaminophen intoxication and many chronic liver diseases, whereas apoptoti c cell death is observed in acute (viral) hepatitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatiti s (NASH). Most liver diseases, however, display a mixed phenotype of cell death [22, 23]. Non-parenchymal cells Macrophages In the liver, macrophages can be broadly defined as either resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) or monocyte-derived macrophages [12], which are responsible for the elimination of pathogens (bacteria) and clearance of foreign compounds, e.g. apoptotic bodies by phagocytosis through a variety of receptors. Kupffer cells reside in the hepatic sinusoids, in close contact with other circulating immune cells, so they participate in local immune responses and are well-positioned to eliminate invading pathogens and remove obsolete cells (eryth rocytes) or cell fragments (apoptotic bodies). Macrophages are also the driving force of inflammation in many liver diseases. Upon activation by various triggers (e.g. bacterial products) the macrophages, including the Kupffer cells, release pro-inflammatory and reactive oxygen species (ROS). These secreted products influence not only the hepatocytes, but also stellate cells, portal myofibroblasts and ot her immune cells. In chronic liver diseases, Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 11 the continuous inflammatory state leads to a fibrogenic response , since the products released from Kupffer cells contribute to th e activation, proliferation and survival of stellate cells and myofibroblasts, in part vi a the activation of the transcription factor Nuclear Factor- B (NF-B) in HSCs and myofibroblasts [24]. On the other hand, macrophages also possess a latent capacity to revive damaged tissue by secreting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that de grade newly synthesized scar matrix. The protease activity of MMPs is inhibited by concurrent production of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) account for 5%-8% of the cells in the liver and are located in the space of Disse, the space be tween the sinusoidal endothelial cells and the basolateral surface of hepatocytes [25, 26]. In the healthy liver, HSC contain large quantities of retinyl-esters pa cked in big lipid droplets that serve as the main storage site of vitamin A in the body. In liver fibrogenesis, the key event is the transdifferentiation of these lose their vitamin A content. Liver myofibroblasts are derived ma inly from the activation of quiescent HSCs, but may also arise from other sources, e.g. portal fibroblasts [27, 28] and bone marrow-derived cells [29, 30]. Although the ex act initial events in the activation of HSCs are still not completely elucidated , various cytokines, growth factors and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved . Upon activation, the HSCs lose their vitamin A content and demonstrate increase d proliferation, contractility, matrix production and pro-inflammatory signal ing. The accumulation and enhanced density and cross-linking of hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) components produced by myofibroblasts leads to fibro sis and is characterized by increased matrix stiffness, hampered blood flow throug h the liver, portal hypertension and complications like variceal bleeding. Regr ession of liver fibr osis can be achieved when the disease-causing factor(s) can be eradicated. Activated HSCs either undergo apoptosis or revert to a quiescent phenot ype characterized by downregulation of markers of fibrosis such as type I (col1a1) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (-SMA) [31, 32]. Subsequently, other cell types in the liver contribute to the clearance of HSCs, e.g. apoptotic HSCs are phagocytized by macrophages and are removed by natural ki ller cells [33-35]. Therefore, removal and/or \"de-activation\" of HSCs/myofibrob lasts is increasingly recognized as an essential step towards the resolution of liver fibrosis. Natural Killer (NK) cells and Natural Killer T-cells (NKT cells) The immune system plays an important ro le in maintaining tissue homeostasis and dysregulation of this system may contribute to several liver diseases. In the context of liver diseases, NK cells and NKT cel ls are important. NK and NKT cells both contain a characteristic set of markers for NK cells cell, in addition, express T cell markers (like 1 Chapter 1 12 CD1) [7, 36, 37]. In acute or chronic liver inju ry, both cell types play an important role in the first-line innate defense against viral infection and tumor transformation, which is associated with many liver diseas e s [ 3 8 , 3 9 ] . T h e d i s t r i b u t i o n o f N K a n d NKT cells is different in the livers of mi ce, rats and humans. NKT cells account for 30-40% of total lymphocytes in mouse liver and only 5-10% of total lymphocytes in rat and human liver [40]. Hepatic NK and NKT cells have many similar functions after activation, such as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN- and IL-4) and the killing of virus-infected ce lls and tumor cells [7]. The major mechanism by which NK cells lead to hepatocyte cell death and liver injury is via the release of TRAIL and granzyme B, whereas NKT cells release predominantly FasL [41]. NK cells also appear to have a negative regula tory effect on fibrogenesis and have been reported to directly kill early-activated or senescent hepatic stellate cells [35, 42, 43]. This probably mediated by IFN- , released by activated NK cells, that inhibits stellate cell activation and amplifies NK cell cytotoxicity against stellate cells [44-46]. On hand, IFN- also a proinflammatory production of NK cells and NKT cells could be bene ficial for the survival of hepatocytes and allow hepatic regeneration, but could also promote fibrogenesis. Interestingly, experimental evidence suggests that IFN- that is specifically targeted to stellate cells suppresses liver fibrosis in sinusoids. They have a unique morphological phenotype that is characterized by open (non-diaphragmed) fenestrae and a lack of basement membrane [50]. This morphology facilitates an optimal exchange of nutrients, oxygen and waste pr oducts between the sinusoidal blood and space of Disse. LSECs are al so responsible for removing soluble macromolecular and colloidal waste products (smaller than 100 nm) [9, 51]. Furthermore, LSEC have the appropriate location, together with Kupffer cells, to play a role in the clearance of pathogens and viruses. Giugliano et al [52] reported the release of antiviral exosomes from the LSEC s that amplify the antiviral activity of interferons in hepatocytes. Additionally, differentiated LSECs that maintain their normal fenestration and function prevent HSC activation. In cocultures of LSECs and HSCs, the presence of LSECs maintains the quiescent state of HSC [53]. Once LSEC differentiation is lost, they promote HSC ac tivation and liver fibrosis. Therefore, differentiated LSECs have a function as ga tekeeper in the fibrotic process [50]. Liver diseases A number of different conditions (inflamm atory disorders and metabolic disorders) affect liver functions, which are associated to multiple cell types discussed above. Traditionally, liver diseases are categorize d into acute liver failure (ALF) and chronic liver failure (CLF) [54, 55]. The essential fe ature of ALF is the abrupt loss of hepatic function due to the loss of large numbers of hepatocytes [56]. This rare but sudden Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 13 syndrome in a patient with no history of liver disease, but causes severe complications (i.e. jaundice, coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, and even multi-organ failure) [57]. Viral hepatitis re mains the cause of a high proportion of cases of ALF, which is common caused by infe ctions of virus A, B, C and E, and leads a high rate of death world while. And vi rus hepatitis predominates in developing countries more than in developed countries [58]. It is not optimistic that of the 350 million hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers worldwide, one-third reside in China [59]. That means 780 000 people die every year due to complications of hepatitis B [60], the number in China is nearly a half reported by National Health and Family Planning Commission of China. Besides virus, to xins, drugs, immunological attacks and various chemicals could also cause hepatitis, and each of these stimulations could be possible to result in CLF. CLF, a progressive and slow deterioration, often occurs in people with incurable chronic liver disease or stable cirrhosis. CLF leads to metabolic disorders of various toxins and presents irreversible chroni c loss of liver function, which usually is accompanied by continuous inflammation [61]. Alcohol consumption has been globally identified as a major risk factor in liver diseases, such as alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) and ASH [62]. The characteris tic of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and AFLD are fat accumulation in the liver (steatosis ) and with alcohol consumption 20-30 g/day (AFLD) and without any evidence of chronic liver diseases and lower alcohol drink (NAFLD). Furthermor e, advanced stages of these two liver diseases are NASH and ASH [63]. The cons equence and final stage of various CLF are generally liver fibrosis and liver cirrhosis [64]. Actually, fibrosis is the liver's protective response to injury , and this intrinsic reaction wi ll protect the liver against further damage from the structure and functions of differential cell types. So the liver can be reversed by itself from fibrosis ev en cirrhosis to normal architecture when the insults removed or the causes treated. The successful reversion of fibrosis and cirrhosis should include the degradation of excess ECM [64], and (MMPs) asso main cont ributions to degrade excess ECM. But the objective situations usually do not look good. Accumulation of deposited extracellular matrix (types I and type IV fi brillary collagens), server liver injury and uncontrolled immune responses to inflamma tory, will finally cause irreversible liver fibrosis characterized by cellular activation of HSCs (see above). And therefore, this is one main topic focused in this thesis. Cirr hosis is defined as fibrous scarring of the hepatic parenchyma resulting in nodule formation and collapse of liver structures. Now it is fourth cause of morbidity and mortality in central Europe [65]. Collectively, these are among the key initiating risk fact ors for two types of primary liver cancer: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) an d cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) [66]. Additionally, in 1995, a third type of live r failure acute-on-chr onic liver failure (ACLF) was described for the first time [67]. The definition of this new entity is based on patients with 3 key syndromes: li ver cirrhosis presenting with acute decompensation, a high rate of organ failur e and a high short -term of mortality [68, 1 Chapter 1 14 69]. Unfortunately, the classification of AC LF is still not universal defined so far. However, the further improvement concerning of ALF according to its prognosis will be beneficial to clinical managements on these patients. Signal transduction in hepatic injury Although the liver has a high regenerative capacity, the loss of viable and functional hepatocytes may lead to liver failure, depe nding on the type and severity of the injury. The massive and acute loss of a large proportion of functional hepatocytes, as in acute liver failure or fulminant hepatit is, may not be compensated by hepatocyte regeneration because of an inability of the hepatocytes to regenerate in these conditions or because the loss of hepatocyte s is too extensive. On the other hand, in chronic liver failure there is a continuous, but more moderate loss of hepatocytes, which can be compensated by regeneration. However, in chronic liver injury, the continuous presence of an insult may result in sustained inflammation and fibrogenesis, eventually exceeding the re generative capacity of hepatocytes and leading to liver failure. In addition, the co ntinuous regenerative trigger may lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To unders tand the pathogenesis of liver diseases we will now first review some of the key signaling mechanisms involved in liver inflammation and liver fibrosis. Inflammatory cytokines, interferons and chemokines In acute and/or chronic liver injury, the cellular wound-healing response is accompanied by the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The release of these soluble factors contribute s to the wound healing response and the clearance of foreign substances and cell debris and is therefore beneficial. However, excessive and/or prolonged production of these factors may be detrimental to hepatocytes and also lead to uncontrolled ac tivation and proliferation of stellate cells. In fact, some of the released cytokines, such as TNF- , interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 play a role in the proliferative response of hepatocytes and induce the production of so-called acute phase protei ns that are important in maintenance of homeostasis. Other cytokines, like FasL, TNF- and other so-called receptor can induce apoptotic cell death in hepatocytes. Hence, TNF- plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response of the live r, since it has both proliferative and cell protective effects by activating the transcription factor NF- B and it has pro-apoptotic properties (when cells are unable to activate NF-kB) by activating death receptor pathways. Furthermore, TNF- controls the production of many other cytokines. The biological effects of TNF- are mediated by its receptors TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1) and TNF-R2. Signaling by TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 is achieved by recruitment of adaptor proteins that bind to the cytosolic domains of the receptors (like MyD88) and initiate signal transduction events [70]. IL-1 is another potent inflammatory cytokine that signals through th e IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1), leading to an inflammatory cascade. Increased levels of IL-1 contribute to the progression of several chronic inflammatory liver di seases, including NASH and Alcoholic Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 15 steatohepatitis (ASH). Interferons (IFNs, IFN- / and IFN- ) comprise a family of proteins, which interact with cells via distinct cellular receptors. Type II IFN (IFN- ) is produced mainly by macrophages, NK cells, and T lymphocytes [71], while type I IFN is produced by fibroblasts, epithelial cells an d hepatocytes [72]. IFNs have been tested as anti-fibrotic agents in patients with moderate fi brosis. It was demonstrated that IFN- displays anti-fibrotic effects and su ppresses proliferation and -SMA expression in HSCs. Furthermore, IFN- activates NK cells that in turn induce death of HSCs [73]. Additionally, IFN- can inhibit the repeated hepatoce llular injury and reduce liver fibrosis induced by Con A [74] Chemokines are small proteins (8-13 kDa) and are 4 different families: CC, CXC, CX3C, C) [75]. It ha s been shown that chemokines and their receptors play a seminal role in the path ogenesis of various acute and chronic liver diseases. Chemokines, by virtue of thei r capacity to attract inflammatory and immune cells to sites of inflammation, not only drive inflammation and immune responses, but also participate in fibr ogenesis and cancer [76]. CCL2 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1, MCP-1) is one of th e best characterized chemokines. In the chronically inflamed liver, CCL2 is secreted by many different cell types [77, 78], but mainly by Kupffer cells and HSCs, which contribute to the recruitment and accumulation of macrophages and monocyte s into the liver. During development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and NASH, CCL2 and its receptor are upregulated in the liver, where it prom otes hepatic and systemic inflammation related to metabolic disorders [79-81]. Transcription factor Nuclear Factor- B (NF-B) NF-B is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is activated by a variety of stimuli, including cytokines (TNF- , Transforming growth factor (TGF)- ) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). NF- B is a key regulator of many cellular responses involved in inflammation and stress in chronic liver di seases (e.g. viral hepatitis, liver fibrosis and NAFLD) [82]. The -1) and p65 Additional giving rise to alternative homo- and heterodimers. Normally, NF- B is retained in an inactive form in the cytoplasm through association with one of the I B inhibitory proteins, including IKK- or IKK-, and this interaction blocks the ability of NF- B to translocate to nucleus. Upon stimulation of appropriate receptors, e.g. binding of TNF- to its receptor, the I B kinase (IKK) complex is phosphorylated and activated. The IKK complex is composed of a regulatory subunit (IKK- ) and two kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of I B. Phosphorylation of I B leads to its poly-ubiquitination and subsequent prot eolytic degradation. These events allow the translocation of NF- B from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where NF- B acts by inducing the transcription of target genes [83]. The target genes of NF- B include inflammation-related genes, like cytokines, including TNF- itself and chemokines, 1 Chapter 1 16 but also anti-apoptotic genes. Therefore, NF- B has a pivotal role in the inflammatory response. Theref ore, there is a tremendous, ongoing effort to identify and develop drugs that target NF- B activity. However, since NF- B is associated with pro-survival activity, the continuous ac tivation of this transcription factor in inflammatory disorders might also predispose for an increased risk for (MAPK) family, are involved in multip le signaling cascades that lead to hepatocellular cell death. It is a pro-apoptotic kinase and is involved in hepatocellular injury in inflammatory, metabo lic and fibrotic liver diseases. The liver expresses two isoforms, JNK1 JNK2, PDGF-mediated Smad 2/3 signaling [85]. In addition, the interplay between NF- B and JNK has been extensively investigated and reviewed [ 70, 86, 87]. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that NF- B generates its survival signals in part via inhibition of the prolonged activation of JNK by TNF- [70], and in turn, activation of JNK prolonged NF-kB-deficient cells [88]. Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) are essential receptors in the host defense against pathogens in the early innate immune resp onse. TLRs have the ability to recognize highly conserved structural motifs known as pathogen-associated microbial patterns (PAMPs), which include various bacter ial cell wall components, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN) and lipopeptides. LPS, the TLR4 ligand, induces inflammatory signals in multip le cell types in the liver. The activation of TLR4 on Kupffer cells leads to the prod in [92, 93]. Several therapeutic agents targeting the TLRs ar e now under pre-clinical and clinical evaluation. However, given the complexity of signaling and the multitude of TLRs, interventions in these pathways may act as double-edged swords either promoting or inhibiting disease progression. Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 17 Figure 2. Cascade of signals following liver injury CCL2 and CCR2: factor. Reprinted with permission from Antonella Pellicoro \u00a9 2014 Nature Publishing Group [12]. Liver injury leads to necrotic and/or ap optotic cell death of parenchymal cells. Phagocytosed cell debris leads to activa tion of macrophages and HSCs, which is amplified by the release of cytokines and reactive oxygen species. These pro-inflammatory mediators also recrui t T cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes, amplifying the inflammatory response. Incr eased gut permeability, e.g. during acute inflammation, leads to increased transloca tion of gut-derived endotoxins, via the portal blood, to the liver. In the liver, endo toxins and other bacterial products bind to CD14 and TLR4 receptors on Kupffer cells, triggering an inflammatory response, including the activation of stress-activated and mitogen-activated protein kinase mediators one of the key factors driving fibrogenesis. TGF- is mainly 1 Chapter 1 18 produced by inflammatory and immune cells and directly promotes liver fibrosis via stimulation of HSC transdifferentiation in to myofibroblasts, a process characterized by increased expression of -SMA and collagen type I. The growth factor PDGF also stimulates proliferation of myofibroblasts. Reversal of matrix deposition and scar accumulation is regulated by MMPs and its natural inhibitors (TIMPs). Upon removal or termination of the underlying triggers for liver injury (alcohol, fat, hepatitis viruses), the liver is, to some extent, capable to regenerate and resolve fibrosis [95-97]. Therapeutic drugs for liver diseases Liver diseases are difficult to treat by medication. Yet, several drugs are now prescribed for various liver diseases: fo r NASH and NAFLD, statins, such as pravastatin and atorvastatin, are the most pr escribed drugs. They act by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and thereby reduce cholesterol synthesis. These drugs improv e liver histology and serum markers in patients and are in general safe, with only rare examples of toxic side-effects [98]. In recent years, the anti-diabetic drug metformin is increasingly prescribed for NASH/NAFLD patients with good results [99] . In the treatment of HCC, sorafenib is commonly used for unresectable/non-ablat able or advanced-stage HCC. It is PDGF receptor) [100]. c acid is used in the treatment of cholestatic diseases [101]. Lamivudine, a deox ycytidine analogue that has a high oral bioavailability is active against hepatiti s B virus (HBV) [102]. The major mechanism of lamivudine is blocking viral DNA synthesis and inhibiting HBV replication. Finally, hepatitis C virus infection is treated by a cocktail of drugs that inhibit various HCV proteins, including the HCV polymerase and protease. Unfortunately, many of the currently available therapies are not ve ry effective (with the exception of the novel treatment for HCV [103]). Furthermore, most of these therapeutic interventions target the agents that cause the disease, but not target the already ongoing inflammation, cell death and/or fibrogenes is. In fact, there ar e currently no drugs available that directly target liver fibros is, while more general anti-fibrotic drugs have a significant risk for side effects [104], for instance pirfenidon e that may lead to gastrointestinal syndromes[15] (inhibiting TGF- expression and activation) or tyrosine kinase cAbl) [107]. For end stage liver failure, the only effective therapeutic option is liver transplantation. Since the supply of donor organs is inadequate to meet the growing demand, this is also not an optimal solution for many patients . Therefore, complementary and alternative medicines have gained increasing attentio n for the treatment of liver diseases. Herbal products for the tr eatment of liver disease An important group of complementary and alternative medicines are herbal p r o d u c t s . F o r t h o u s a n d s o f y e a r s , h e r b a l p r o d u c t s h a v e b e e n u s e d b y i n d i g e n o u s people worldwide to treat a plethora of illnesses. In the past few decades, these Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 19 natural products also caught attention in Western countries. Many cultures have used traditional medicine for the treatment of diseases, e.g. in China (traditional Chinese medicine, TCM), Japan (Kamp medicine), Korea (traditional Korean medicine), Indonesia (Jamu), India (A yurvedic medicine), North America (phytotherapy), and Europe (herbalism) [108]. The medical application of herbal products has fostered research into the chem ical and biological analyses of numerous prescriptions [109-112]. Simultaneously, it has initiated a successful approach to novel drug identification and development through the isolation and purification of active ingredients from herbal products [113] [114]. A few examples of herbal products that have been used in the treatment of liver diseases will now be discussed. Silymarin (Milk thistle) Silymarin, the extract of (Fig. 2). The major component silybinin (also called silybin) accounts for 90% of the herb's flavonoid content in most preparations. Silymarin is found commonly throughout Europe, Asia and North America. Its extracts were already used as early as the 4 th century B.C. and became a single-herb remedy for liver disease and ja undice in the 1960s [115, 116]. One of the reasons why silymarin became so popular is because of its postulated mechanisms of actions that include antioxidant activi ty, anti-inflammatory activities and hepatoprotective actions with little or no toxicity [117-119] . Studies in cell culture and animal models demonstrated that silymarin enhances the activity of ribosomal RNA polymerase in hepatocytes and decreases he patic injury by inhibiting glutathione depletion in hepatocytes and inhibiti the by Kupffer cells [120]. Furthermore, sylimarin has been shown to block proliferation of HSCs [121] and to inhibit TGF- 1-induced collagen secretion [122]. Several clinical trials have sh own the beneficial effects of silymarin in liver diseases, including liver cirrhosis, no n-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis B/C virus infection and liver cancer [123, 124] . The beneficial effects of silymarin on parameters of liver injury (AST, ALT) are thought to be caused by modulation of immune responses and improvement of an ti-oxidant defenses by increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and increasing glutathione levels. Although silymarin shows low intestinal absorption after oral administration, dosages of 420 mg/day are well-tolerated and have shown significant therapeutic effects in the treatment of liver cirrhosis and viral hepa titis. Low doses of silybin (20 to 48 mg/kg/day) are used as an antidote for acute Amanita phalloides (deathcap mushroom) poisoning [118], which occurs frequently in Europe, especially in Germany. The main mechanism of this protec tive action is repressing the uptake of amatoxin (the toxin of Amanita phalloides ) via competitive inhibition of the transporter OATP1B3 and thereby decreasing the concentration of amatoxin in the enterohepatic circulation [125]. Although th e value of silymarin in the treatment of chronic liver failure is still unclear because of the lack of well-controlled clinical trials, it remains the best current ly available therapy for A. phalloides poisoning. 1 Chapter 1 20 Figure 3. The milk thistle ( Silybum marianum ) and the chemical structures of its four major flavonoid constituents. Taken from pere nnial herb that is widely cultivated in Southeast Europe and Western Asia (Fig. 3). It has been used for centuries in traditional medicine to treat cough, bronchi tis, gastritis and live r inflammation [126, 127]. It is available as over-the-counter me dication in liquid, powder and pill forms in the United States. Glycyr rhizin is the aqueous extract of licorice root. It is the conjugate of two molecules of glucuronic acid and one molecule of 18 -glycyrrhetic acid (GA) [128]. Other components of th e aqueous rhizin prevents or attenuates liver injury in several animal models of liver disease, as well as in in liver disease patients in clinical trials. Glycyrrh izin targets the hepatocyte membrane [130, 131] and this property is being exploited by developing hepatocyte-specific delivery systems incorporating glycyrrh izin [132, 133]. In Japan, cont ains glycyrrhizin, cysteine and glycine, is chronic hepa titis [134, 135]. The use of glycyrrhizin in acute and chronic hepatitis is based on it s hepatoprotective, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. In animal models, glycyrrhizin has been demonstrated to suppress the inflammatory response vi a PI3K-mediated inhibition of NF- B activation, resulting in diminished inflammatory cytokines like TNF- and inflammatory reactive oxygen species and prostaglandin E2 [136]. Glycyrrhiz in inhibits infiltration of inflammatory cells into the liver and reduced liver injury in the concanavalin A (ConA) model [137]. In the model alN)/lipopolysaccharide CD4(+)T and enhances IFN- and IL-10 expression in these cells via JNK, ER K and PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanisms. Moreover, glycyrrhizin inhibited ConA-ind uced phosphorylation of JNK, and PI3K/Akt in this study, suggesting that glycyrrhizin attenuates liver injury and fibrosis via modulation of the CD4(+)T cell response [140]. Of note, some studies Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 21 demonstrated that several nuclear receptors, e.g. glucocorticoid receptor, pregnane X receptor (PXR), gamma (PPAR- ), are regulated by glycyrrhizin, which may also be pharmaceutical targets of glycyrrhizin. Moreover, glycyrrhizin was shown to lower AST and ALT levels in a long-term clinical study of HCV patients in Japan and the Netherlands [145, 146]. In glycyrrhizin exerts anti-inflammatory of PPARs, especially PPAR- , which corresponds to the severity of SAH-related inflammation. Figure 4. Glycyrrhiza glabra and Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is an ancient, holistic treatment system established through empirical evaluation. It aims to restore energy (Qi) and balance (Yin and Yang) through the use of complex medicinal plants, fungi, animal products and minerals. TCM typically contains many components and therefore appears quite different from the therapeutic approaches of Western medicine. TCM is a holistic approach, using individualized herbal reme dies to target complex syndromes and to help the body regain balance and harmony [147]. Thus, in TCM, the entire human body is treated as a single unit and th e selected herbs are able to act in a complementary fashion. Supporting evide nce for TCM was documented already in 16 B.C. in the book Pen Tsao , describing more than 300 herbs for medical treatment. The most important basic theory of TCM is the Jun-Chen-Zuo-Shi principle of combining different medicinal compounds in a specific manner when preparing TCM formulations ( Fufang ). Fufang means that each component in a TCM formulation has its own biological target an d the combined action of all components on different biological ta rgets is the principle of Fufang . For instance, most herbal mixtures comprise 4 to 5 herbs of whic h 1 or 2 are pharmacologically active compounds present in high doses. The herb that targets the major symptom of the disease is called Jun (\"Emperor\" or \"King\"). The remaining components, Chen (\"Minister\"), Zuo (\"Assistant\") and Shi (\"Courier\"), have supporting functions, such as strengthening Jun's therapeutic effects, eliminating possible adverse or toxic effects of the Jun and/or Chen components or working synergistically with Jun [148]. 1 Chapter 1 22 It has been demonstrated that at least 42% of patients with liver diseases use some form of traditional medicine, 20% of wh om use herbal preparations [134]. The following section of the introduction de scribes some therapeutic examples of complex herbal medicines that are currently being investigated in clinical trials. Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang (TJ-9) Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang (TJ-9, Sho-saiko-to in Japanese), a classic herbal composite formula, is widely used in China and in Ja pan to treat liver dise ases. It consists baicalin, Saikosaponins, ginsenosides, wogonin, and gingerol (Fig. 4). It is administered orally in doses of up to 7.5 g to patients with chronic viral liver diseases and the concentration of each ac tive component is regulated [149]. In 1995, Oka et al [150] performed a prospective, random ized, non-blind controlled study in 260 patients, which demonstrated a significant beneficial preventive effect of TJ-9 on HCC development, in particular in patien ts that were HBs-Ag negative [119]. In addition, an anti-fibrotic effect of T J-9 in two rat models of liver fibrosis (diethylnitrosamine- and pig serum-induce d liver fibrosis) was demonstrated [151, 152]. More recently, Takahashi et al . reported their findings of TJ-9 treatment in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [153]. TJ-9 significantly alleviated necroinflammation and fibrosis in the liver in this mouse model of NASH. The beneficial effects of TJ-9 were (partly) ca used by increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR ) and reduced expression the components of TJ-9, saikosaponin-C the isomers of saikosaponin, induced apoptosis of lymphocytes, partly by increasing levels of c-myc and p53 mRNA an d decreasing levels of Bcl-2 mRNA [154]. Thus, TJ-9 may hold great promise for the preven tion and/or treatment of complex liver diseases. Figure 5. The seven herbal components of Kampo TJ 9 include bupleurum root (at the bottom), jujube fruit (left bottom), pinellia tuber (b ottom right), ginger (on the top), root (up left), scutellaria root (top right), and gins eng root (on the left). Taken form: http://kampo.ca/herbs-formulas/formulas/shosaikoto/ Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases Fuzheng Huayu (FZHY) Similar to TJ-9, Fuzheng Huayu (FZHY) is a complex preparation of Chinese herbal medicine consisting of six other medicinal herbs (Fig. is a pproved by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of China as an antifi brotic medicine [156] and it has also been reported to promote blood flow and reduce markers of liver injury and cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score) [157]. In clinical trials, FZHY was shown to significantly improve clinical symptoms and liver function, to reverse hepatic fibrosis and to decrease portal pressure in patients with chronic hepa titis B and liver cirrhosis [158]. In animal liver fibrosis, FZHY decreased -SMA expression, attenuated ECM deposition transduction [159, 160]. FZHY also induced apoptosis in activating p38 and inhibiting SAPK/JNK [161, 162], which is opposite to it s effect on hepatocytes. In addition, FZHY has been shown to have antifibrotic pr operties by increasing the production of IFN- by hepatic NK cells [163] and to ha ve anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties by reducing the expression of 2E1 and TNF-R1 [164]. FZHY has successfully comple ted phase 2 clinical trials in the United States [147, 165]. 1 Chapter 1 24 Figure 6.

Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 25 Ipomoea stolonifera Ipomoea pes caprae I p o m o e a S c a r l e t t O i H a r a I p o m o e a t r i c o l o r Figure 7. Members of the Convolvulaceae family. Ipomoea , a large genus of more than 500 species, full of rich colors, grows in the tropical and subtropical zones throughout the world. Most of these species can adapt to harsh environments, such as salty and dry coastal areas. Taken from http://toptropicals.com/ Ipomoea stolonifera (beach morning-glory) Ipomoea stolonifera (IS) is a coastal herb belonging to the Convolvulaceae (morning glory) family (Fig. 6). Like other herbal products, the exact composition of this herb can vary with location, season and even th e altitude where the herbs grow [166, 167]. Even within one genus, extracts of flower s with different colors may vary in their medicinal properties [168, 169]. I. stolonifera normally occurs in tropical and sub-tropical regions, along sandy dunes an d beaches, e.g. the Chaoshan area in Guangdong [170]. Traditionally , it has been used for the treatment of sunstroke, colitis, dysentery and fish puncture wounds, but IS has also been used for the treatment of inflammatory disorders, like rheumatoid arthritis [171]. The actual effective constituents of I. stolonifera are beginning to be elucidated, which is part of the work described in the thesis. In prev ious research, the n-butanol extract of I. stolonifera (BE-IS) was prepared and characteri zed [171]. This extract showed strong anti-inflammatory activity in the carragee nan-induced paw edema test in rats. In 1 Chapter 1 26 order to identify novel and active co mpounds, the BE-IS was subjected to chromatographic analysis and five major constituents were identified based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis: hesperetin and curcumin. Multiple activities for these compounds have been described, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but the therapeutic effectiveness of BE-IS and its five purified components in liver injury has not been elucidated yet. Summary Traditional medicine holds great promise: th e multicomponent nature of traditional medicines has great advantages in the ther apy of many diseases. However, there are also challenges: reconstitution of comp lex mixtures from synthetic, purified compounds may not always reflect the or iginal natural components and minor components may be 'missed'. On the other hand, processing of or iginal preparation to obtain extracts that can be administer ed easily (e.g. preparing extracts), may change the composition of the original prep aration or alter the chemical structure of the active ingredients. In addition, ther e may be batch-to-batch variation between different preparations depending on e.g. season or geographical location. A major challenge will be to identify the optimal composition of complex mixtures. It is often not clear which are the most potent active ingredients or which combination has major therapeutic effects. Therefore the comp lexity and reproducible preparations of natural products still provides significant scientific challeng es [172]. The strict regulation and standa rdization of all aspects of medi cinal plant preparation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) an d the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) hampers the registration and manufacture of herbal products. Another challenge is bridging the gap betw een experimental studies and clinical application. Although the past few decades have witnessed an enormous increase in knowledge from experimental studies, this ha s not been translated in an increase in clinical studies. The reasons for this 'translational gap' are mentioned above: the complexity of natural products and the difficulty in manufacturing specified and reproducible preparations of natural pr oducts. Nevertheless, the prospects for successfully treating patients with liver diseases with valida ted preparations of natural products have never been brighter. Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 27 Scope of the thesis The aim of this thesis is to investig ate the butanol-extract (BE-IS) form Ipomoea stolonifera and five purified compounds of this extract on acute and chronic liver diseases, in particular inflammatory liver diseases and liver fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. In Chapter 1 , we provide an overview of the most important liver cell types and signaling cascades involved in inflammatory liver diseases and an overview of traditional medicine. In Chapter 2 , we evaluated the hepatoprotective effect of BE-IS and its five individual components on the inflammatory response and bile acid-induced cell death in primary hepatocytes in vitro . We demonstrate that each component of BE-IS displayed differential pr operties. Following this initial screen, hesperetin was selected for detailed investigation. In Chapter 3 , we evaluated the therapeutic properties of hesperetin in tw o mouse models of fulm inant hepatitis: the concanavalin A (Con A) model and D-galactosamine /lipopolysaccharide (D-GalN/LPS) model. We demonstrate a profou nd therapeutic effect of hesperetin in these models of fulminant hepatitis. Fo llowing promising effects of the BE-IS component esculetin on hepatic myofibroblasts in vitro , in Chapter 4 we evaluated esculetin for anti-fibrotic effects in a mouse model of liver fibrosis (CCl 4-induced hepatotoxicity). In Chapter 5 , a follow-up study of the anti-fibrotic effect of esculetin is presented, in which the optimal route of administration and duration of treatment for esculetin were determined. In Chapter 6 , the results of this thesis are discussed focusing on strategies for the treatment of inflammatory liver disorders and hepatic fibrosis and providing an outlook for the app lication of our findings in the treatment of human liver diseases. 1 Chapter 1 28 References [1] Chiang J.
