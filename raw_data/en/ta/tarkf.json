In 2016, my dad passed away unexpectedly and for a few months, I was quite tired and stressed. Then I found out I was pregnant. While I was pregnant, I had a swollen knee and was achy. I was exhausted but my doctors just put it down to the pregnancy. It wasn't until I was pregnant with my second baby in 2018, that I knew something wasn't right. I was in a lot of pain, so they sent me for more tests. Then I found out I had rheumatoid arthritis. Since then, I've been on loads of different medications. I've been on methotrexate for about 18 months, and it helped a bit. But I was still in a lot of pain, so my doctor started prescribing me etanercept last year. The etanercept has made such a difference and I've got a lot more energy now.Some people don't understand that I might wake up in the morning and have a flare-up, which can be difficult when making plans. I might not be able to make it that day because I can't get on the bus or the train. Or maybe I'm not comfortable driving that day because I'm tired and haven't slept all night. Every day is different though and it's not something I can predict. It can be exhausting being a mum with rheumatoid arthritis. So, I think it's important to accept help and make things easy for yourself. We keep batch meals in the freezer so that, on days that I'm tired or I'm having a flare, we have easy meals on hand rather than having to get a takeaway or cook from scratch. We also keep a bag of new toys or colouring books so that I can sit down and play with the kids if I'm having a flare and can't run around after them. My husband supports me, and my mum has been brilliant as well. She calls me every day and helps out if I'm having a bad day. There are times, where I think I could just stay in bed all day and not do anything. But I've got to keep going for my kids because they need me. I work as an accountant, and my workplace has been very supportive, especially because I have so many appointments. I've found working from home better too. It's not a rush in the morning to get ready and, on a bad day, you can lie down on the sofa if you just need 10 minutes to rest. I wish I had researched more about rheumatoid arthritis when I was first diagnosed. Through Versus Arthritis and Instagram, I found a community. It's helped having that support, and I've made a few friends as well. I felt guilty some days, especially when the kids want to do things or run around, and I can't do it. It's helpful to feel like you're in the same boat as other people. That it's not just me.

Rheumatoid arthritis (room-a-toyd arth-rye-tus) is a long-term condition that can cause pain, swelling and stiffness in your joints. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition. This means that the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues in your body, rather than germs or viruses. If untreated, this can damage your joints, cartilage, and nearby bones. How does rheumatoid arthritis affect the joints? A joint is where two or more bones meet. They allow you to bend, twist and turn freely. The joint is held together by a capsule, which stops the bones from moving too far, and inside the capsule, there is an inner lining called the synovium. This makes a thick fluid, called synovial fluid, that protects the joint. The ends of the bones are covered with a thin layer of slippery tissue called cartilage. This acts as a protective cushion, stopping the bones from rubbing against each other. Strong cords called tendons anchor the muscles to the bones. When we move, our muscles pull the tendons, which then pull our bones in certain directions. Inflammation is the body's way to heal itself after an infection or injury. It increases the flow of blood and fluid to the affected area making it swollen, red, painful and hot. However, if you have rheumatoid arthritis, the body mistakenly sends inflammation to joints, even though there's no infection to fight. This inflammation isn't needed and can cause problems. When the inflammation goes down, the joint capsule can remain stretched. This means it can't hold the joint in its proper position, which causes the joint to become unstable. versusarthritis.org Helpline 0800 5200 520What are the symptoms? The main symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis are: joint pain joint swelling, warmth and redness stiffness, especially first thing in the morning or after sitting still for a long time Rheumatoid arthritis can affect any joint in the body, although the small joints in the hands and feet are often the first to be affected. Both sides of the body are usually affected at the same time, in the same way. But this doesn't always happen.9 8 versusarthritis.org Helpline 0800 5200 520As well as joint problems, you may experience other symptoms, such as: tiredness and lack of energy - this is known as fatigue not feeling hungry weight loss a high temperature, or a fever sweating dry eyes - as a result of inflammation chest pain - as a result of inflammation. Rheumatoid arthritis is sometimes called a systemic condition. This means it can affect the whole body, rather than just one part of it. How will it affect me? Being told you have rheumatoid arthritis can be a shock. You might be feeling anxious about what comes next and how your life will change. But, thankfully, the outlook for people with rheumatoid arthritis is improving all the time, as new and more effective treatments become available. So, you can still lead a full and active life with rheumatoid arthritis, if you take your medication and make any necessary lifestyle changes. The symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis usually develop slowly over time. But, in some cases, it can progress quickly over a few days. These symptoms can vary from person to person. They may come and go, change over time or you may have periods where the symptoms of your condition come back or get worse. This is called a flare-up or flare. However, if you get diagnosed early and receive the right treatment, it's possible to have months or even years between flares. Complications If you have rheumatoid arthritis, you may also have a greater risk of developing other conditions, such as those below. Carpal tunnel syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome is when you have more pressure than normal on a nerve in your wrist. Symptoms include: aching numbness tingling in your thumb, fingers and part of the hand You can often control it yourself using wrist splints, hand exercises and painkillers. But, in some severe cases, you may need a steroid injection or surgery. Inflammation in other parts of your body As well as your joints, rheumatoid arthritis can cause inflammation in other parts of your body, such as your: heart - Your heart is surrounded by a fluid-filled sac called the pericardium. If this becomes inflamed, it can lead to a condition known as pericarditis. This causes chest pain and a high temperature.You don't need to face arthritis alone. If you need support or advice, call our Helpline today on 0800 5200 520 . Our advisors can give you expert information and advice about arthritis and can offer support whenever you need it most.versusarthritis.org Helpline 0800 5200 520 10 eyes - Inflammation in your eyes can lead to scleritis or Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Scleritis can cause pain, redness, sensitivity to light and blurry vision. Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome can cause dry, sore eyes and you might find that your eyes become sticky with mucus when you wake up. lungs - Inflammation in your lungs can lead to conditions such as pleurisy, pulmonary fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This can cause chest pain, a cough that won't go away and shortness of breath. blood vessels - In rare cases, rheumatoid arthritis may cause inflammation in your blood vessels, known as vasculitis. This can cause the walls of your blood vessels to become thick, narrow and weak. In serious cases, this can affect blood flow to your body's organs and tissues. For more information, visit vasculitis.org.uk Cardiovascular diseaseIf you have rheumatoid arthritis, you're at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). This is a general term used to describe conditions that affect the heart or blood vessels, such as heart attacks and strokes. You can reduce your risk by: making sure your condition is controlled taking your medication eating a healthy, balanced diet keeping active stopping smoking. Cervical myelopathy If you've had rheumatoid arthritis for a while, you have a greater risk of getting cervical myelopathy. This is caused by the joints at the top of your spine dislocating and putting pressure on your spinal cord. It's a serious condition that can affect your mobility, so it should be treated as soon as possible. Symptoms include neck pain, loss of balance, trouble walking and weakness or numbness in the limbs. Joint damage If you don't get treatment early enough, or your rheumatoid arthritis isn't controlled, this could lead to joint damage. If this happens, you may need to have surgery. Rheumatoid nodules A few people with rheumatoid arthritis may develop fleshy lumps called rheumatoid nodules (room-a-toyd nod-yools). Around 20% of people with rheumatoid arthritis will get these nodules and they most commonly occur in joints such as the hands, fingers, knuckles or elbows. Rheumatoid nodules usually don't hurt. If they're small, they can be ignored. But if these nodules interfere with your day-to-day life, it's worth speaking to your GP. There's little research on how to reduce these nodules. But some disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biological therapies may reduce the chance of these nodules forming. Sometimes a steroid may be injected under the nodule to help reduce its size and surgery is another option. However, the nodule may return to the same spot again. 11 If you don't get treatment early enough, or your rheumatoid arthritis isn't controlled, this could lead to joint damage. If this happens, you may need to have surgery.versusarthritis.org Helpline 0800 5200 520 13 12What causes rheumatoid arthritis? Rheumatoid arthritis affects around 400,000 people in the UK. We don't know what causes it. But several factors may increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: Age Rheumatoid arthritis can affect you at any age, but most people are diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 60. Sex Rheumatoid arthritis is two to three times more common among women than men. We don't know why. It may be because of the hormone oestrogen but the link hasn't been proven. Genes There's no single gene that causes rheumatoid arthritis, although, there's some evidence that suggests that rheumatoid arthritis can run in families. However, the risk of inheriting rheumatoid arthritis is thought to be low, because genes are thought to only play a small role in developing the condition. Weight If you're overweight, you have a greater chance of developing rheumatoid arthritis than if you're a healthy weight. Eating a balanced diet and exercising is a good way to manage your weight. Smoking Some research suggests that people who smoke have a greater risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. Stopping smoking can be tough. But it could really improve your condition.

First, your doctor will ask about your symptoms. They will look for swollen joints and check how well your joints move. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect different parts of your body at once, so it's important to tell your doctor about any symptoms you've had, even if they don't seem to be related. If they think you have rheumatoid arthritis, you will be referred to a rheumatologist who may arrange blood tests to confirm a diagnosis. It may take a while to get your results so ask your healthcare team when you're likely to hear back from them. Your doctor may start your treatment or give you medication before you get a diagnosis. Blood tests There is no single blood test that confirms you have rheumatoid arthritis. However, there are a few tests that can show possible signs of the condition. Usually, you don't have to avoid eating or drinking before these tests, but your doctor will let you know if you do. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) This test shows the level of inflammation in your body.If you're waiting for a diagnosis, there are plenty of ways you can help to manage your symptoms. For advice, visit versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/managing-symptoms/C-reactive protein (CRP) testThis test also helps to measure inflammation in your body. Full blood count A full blood count can rule out other possible causes for your symptoms. A full blood count measures how many red blood cells are in your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body in your blood and if you don't have enough, you may have anaemia. Anaemia is common in people with rheumatoid arthritis. But if you have anaemia, it doesn't prove you have rheumatoid arthritis. For example, you might have anaemia because there's not enough iron in your diet. Seropositive and seronegative (rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies)If you have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, you may have been told that you are seropositive or seronegative. If you're told you're seropositive, it means that you have one or both antibodies present in your blood: rheumatoid factor (RF) people with rheumatoid arthritis have one or both antibodies. But you can still be diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis if you don't have them. Because of this, some rheumatology doctors don't think it's a useful term and it won't affect your treatment. Antibodies are produced by your immune system in response to things that your body sees as dangerous, such as germs and viruses. Antibodies attack them and make them harmless.17 16 versusarthritis.org Helpline 0800 5200 520 17Disease Activity Score (DAS28) Your doctor may also measure how active your condition is using a Disease Activity Score (DAS). A Disease Activity Score is a scoring system that helps your doctors see how your condition affects your body, and how it reacts to treatment. For rheumatoid arthritis, this assessment is called the DAS28. DAS stands for 'disease activity score' and the number 28 refers to the 28 joints your doctor will look at in your assessment. This tool allows your doctor to monitor how your condition changes. Plus, it can also be used to check if you're suitable for certain treatments. The DAS28 score isn't necessarily black and white though. Because of this, your rheumatologist will consider if you have any other medical conditions too. Scans You may also have some scans to check if you have any joint inflammation or damage. These include: x-rays - a test that creates images of the inside of the body. It's used to look for injury or damage to the bones or joints. ultrasound scans - uses sound waves to build up pictures of the inside of the body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans - a scan that uses magnets to look at what is happening inside your body. An MRI scan can show soft-tissue damage - in the muscles, ligaments or nerves - as well as any problems with the bones. computerised tomography (CT) scans - a scan that uses x-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of your body. These are sometimes called CAT scans.Treatment Once you have been diagnosed, you will be seen at a rheumatology clinic in a hospital. You'll usually see a specialist doctor, known as a rheumatologist, and a rheumatology nurse specialist. There are three main ways to treat rheumatoid arthritis: drugs physical therapies surgery. Drugs Drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis include: treatments janus kinase inhibitors (JAK inhibitors) steroid treatments, as needed. You may need to take more than one drug at a time because different drugs work in different ways. Over time, you may also change what drugs you take. This will depend on how bad your symptoms are, or if your condition has changed. You should carry on taking the drugs given to you by your doctor, even when you're feeling a bit better. This will reduce the risk of flares. If you're thinking about stopping your treatment, you should discuss this with your doctor first. For more information, visit versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/treatments/drugs/19 change the way a condition progresses, rather than just treating symptoms. They're not painkillers, but they'll reduce pain, swelling and stiffness by slowing down the condition and its effects on the joints. They're long-term medications, which means it often takes weeks or months for them to work. You will usually need to keep taking them, even if they don't seem to be working at first. And you'll need to continue them, even when you start to feel better, in order to keep your condition under control. There are two types of DMARDs: conventional DMARDs and biological therapies. Conventional as: leflunomide methotrexate mycophenolate sulfasalazine. Biological therapies (sometimes called biologics) are newer drugs used to treat some long-term conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis. They reduce the effects of key parts of the immune system, that might be attacking the body's healthy tissues. Biological therapies target individual molecules and tend to work more quickly than conventional DMARDS. They're only given to people who have tried other drugs and not responded well to them. Biologics include drugs such as: (JAK inhibitors) Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK inhibitors) are newer types of drugs. They are usually offered to people who can't take DMARDs or biologics, or people who haven't them. JAK inhibitors include: tofacitinib baricitinib. Painkillers Painkillers can help to relieve the pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis. But they shouldn't be the only treatment you receive. There are many types and strengths of painkillers available. Some painkillers, such as paracetamol, can be bought over the counter from a pharmacy or supermarket. Other painkillers, such as codeine, are only available on prescription. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) NSAIDs are used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. But they will not stop your rheumatoid arthritis from getting worse over time. NSAIDs start working within a few hours, and the effects can be felt for up to a whole day. Some can be bought from supermarkets or chemists, but others are only available on prescription. They're available as tablets, creams and gels, injections and patches. NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen. You can take them along with painkillers. Steroids Steroids help to ease symptoms such as swelling, pain and stiffness. They are usually given to provide short-term relief. This might be during a flare-up or while you're waiting for a DMARD to start working. 21 20 versusarthritis.org Helpline 0800 5200 520Steroids are also sometimes known as corticosteroids. These are different to the anabolic steroids that bodybuilders and athletes use. Steroids can be used as: a tablet or liquid you drink an injection directly into a joint an injection into a muscle. Physical therapies You might also be offered physical therapies to ease your symptoms and improve your mobility. These include physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and occupational therapy. Physiotherapy Physiotherapy is given by trained specialists, known as physiotherapists, to help people with an injury or long-term health condition be active and independent. It involves movement, exercise, manual therapy, education and advice to help ease your pain and help your muscles and joints move more easily. Hydrotherapy Hydrotherapy, also known as aquatic therapy, is exercise that takes place in a warm water swimming pool, with a physiotherapist. It normally takes place in a physiotherapy department at a hospital. Occupational therapy Occupational therapy provides practical support to help you keep your independence and carry on doing everyday activities. An occupational therapist can look at your work, home or school and offer suggestions to make tasks easier.Surgery Not everyone with rheumatoid arthritis will need surgery, but sometimes it can help to reduce pain, correct the shape of your joint or improve your mobility. Foot surgery Examples of this type of surgery include: removal of inflamed tissues from the forefoot (the front of your foot) removal of the small joints in the ball of the foot straightening of toes fixing of joints. Finger, hand and wrist surgeryExamples of this type of surgery include: carpal tunnel release (used to treat carpal tunnel syndrome) removal of inflamed tissue in the finger joints release of tendons in the fingers. Arthroscopy Arthroscopy is a type of keyhole surgery that's used to diagnose and treat joint problems. It's often used to repair damaged cartilage, drain excess fluid or remove bits of loose bone or cartilage. The equipment is very small, so only small cuts are needed. Because of this, it has a faster healing time and a lower risk of infection. Sometimes you can go home on the same day as the surgery, but you will need to rest your joint.23 22 versusarthritis.org Helpline 0800 5200 520Joint replacement Some people with rheumatoid arthritis might need surgery to replace part, or all, of a joint. This is known as a joint replacement, or arthroplasty. Common joint replacements include the hip, knee and shoulder. Thousands of people have joint replacement surgeries each year. But, as with any surgery, it's important to think about the possible risks and to discuss them with your surgeon before you decide to go ahead. How can I manage my symptoms? Flare-ups When your symptoms come back or get worse, this is known as a flare-up or a flare. These can happen at any time, but it often happens at times when you've been stressed or had an infection. Over time, you may get better at noticing the early signs of a flare- up. But if you're having regular flare-ups, you should talk to your doctor because they might need to look at your treatment. Here are a few things you can do to help yourself during a flare-up: Keep taking your medication at the doses you've been prescribed. Do gentle exercises to help reduce stiffness. Use a hot water bottle or heat pad. Put cold items on your joint - for example, a bowl of cold water with ice cubes, a pack of frozen peas wrapped in a towel, or a damp towel that has been kept in the fridge. Let people around you know, so they can give you a helping hand. For more information, visit versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/treatments/surgery/ Keeping active It can be hard to keep moving if you have arthritis. Many people worry that they'll hurt themselves or further damage their joints. But the truth is staying as active as possible could actually help your symptoms. Keeping moving will make your muscles strong, your joints mobile and help to improve symptoms such as fatigue and pain. Plus, it's good for your mental health. If you're new to exercise or haven't exercised in a while, you might feel a bit sore the first few times you try it. But, if you stick with it, it will get easier. 25 24 versusarthritis.org Helpline 0800 5200 520You don't need any special gear to get started, and a lot of physical activity can be done at home. For more advice, check out these exercises for healthy joints versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/exercising-with-arthritis/exercises-for-healthy-joints/ Start small and remember that any exercise is better than nothing. Your body is designed to move and resting too much could actually harm your joints and the tissues around them. If you're finding it difficult to stay motivated, it might help to exercise with a friend or in a group. It can be a great way to socialise and meet new people too. We run activities across the country specially designed for people with arthritis, such as walking groups and Chair Chi. To see if we host any physical activity classes in your area, visit versusarthritis.org/in-your-area/ If you'd rather exercise from the comfort of your own home, be sure to check out our free exercise programmes on our website. From tai chi to quick gym workouts, it's packed full of free, online exercise classes, specially designed for people with arthritis. Healthy eating It's important to eat a healthy, balanced diet if you have arthritis. This will give you all the nutrients you need such as calcium, vitamin D and iron. Plus, it'll help you maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight can put extra burden on the joints in your knees, hips ankles and feet, causing pain and mobility problems.For more advice on getting some more movement in your life, check out our Keep moving booklet or visit versusarthritis.org/exerciseYour plate should include a variety of foods from all five food groups. This includes: fruit and vegetables, such as apples and carrots carbohydrates, such as wholewheat pasta or brown rice proteins such as fish or pulses dairy or dairy alternatives, such as cheese and yoghurt oils and spreads, such as olive oil. Eating a Mediterranean-style diet is a good option, for instance, because it is packed with lots of fruit and vegetables, oily fish, nuts, seeds and olive oil. For more information, see our Eating well with arthritis booklet or visit versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/managing-symptoms/diet/ versusarthritis.org Helpline 0800 5200 520 26Complementary treatments Some people find complementary and alternative treatments, such as acupuncture and aromatherapy, useful. However, they shouldn't replace your prescribed medicines and you should always talk to your doctor before starting treatment. Sleep and fatigue Getting a good night's sleep can be tough at the best of times. But it can be particularly hard to get enough rest when you have rheumatoid arthritis. You might find it difficult to sleep if your joints are achy and swollen. Or you might wake up in the middle of the night with pain. For more information, visit versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/complementary-and-alternative-treatmentsHere are a few tips to help you sleep better: Keep your bedroom dark, quiet and clutter-free. Have a warm bath or shower an hour before bedtime to help ease stiff joints. Follow a routine - try to go to bed and wake up at a similar time each day. Gentle exercise can ease swollen joints and help you unwind, but it's best to avoid energetic exercise close to bedtime. Avoid drinking tea, coffee or alcohol for a few hours before bedtime. Avoid eating main meals close to bedtime. Turn off your screens (e.g. phone, tablets and laptops) an hour before bed. Don't keep checking the time during the night. For more information on how to get a good night's sleep, see our Sleep booklet, or visit versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/managing-symptoms/sleep/ For more advice on fatigue, check out our Fatigue and arthritis booklet or visit versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/managing-symptoms/managing-fatigue/ 27 versusarthritis.org Helpline 0800 5200 520 29 28Foot care If you have rheumatoid arthritis, you're more at risk of developing problems in your feet. But getting into a good footcare routine can reduce this risk and allow you to spot any problems early on. Wearing good, supportive, properly fitting footwear can help improve your balance and posture. This reduces strain on your joints too. It's also worth getting your feet measured each time you shop for new footwear. Remember that your feet change shape throughout your life. If you're having trouble with your feet, it's worth speaking to a podiatrist. This is a healthcare professional who treats foot problems. They can give you advice on footwear, show you how to treat foot problems, and can provide special insoles called orthotics. For more advice, check out our Footcare booklet or visit versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/managing-symptoms/footcare-and-footwear/ for more information. For footwear recommendations from people with arthritis, join our online community at community.versusarthritis.orgStop smoking Stopping smoking can be tough. But if you have rheumatoid arthritis, it could really help your condition. Smoking can make your symptoms worse and increase your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. Plus, it can also reduce the effectiveness of some drugs used to treat your condition. You're more likely to quit with support. So, if you're struggling, speak to your doctor or rheumatology team as they'll be able to help. Living with rheumatoid arthritis Work Having rheumatoid arthritis can make work a bit more challenging. But there are things in place to support you. Anyone working with a disability in the UK has a right to equal treatment at work. The Equality Act 2010 protects you from discrimination. This also means that your employer should work with you to make the workplace accessible to you by making reasonable adjustments. Reasonable adjustments can be anything from adjusting your working hours or providing you with special equipment that helps you do your job. If your employer can't make all the adjustments you need, you may be able to get help through Access to Work. This can cover grants to pay for equipment or adaptations, support workers to help you, or help to get to and from work.For more advice, visit nhs.uk/better-health/quit-smoking versusarthritis.org Helpline 0800 5200 520 31 30Access to Work operates in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But the application process differs from place to place. Rheumatoid arthritis is mostly commonly diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 60. But it can also affect younger people too. If you're facing different challenges at school and university, there's support in place to help you. Emotional wellbeing Living with rheumatoid arthritis can cause pain and fatigue, but it can also take a toll on your mental health too. Depression is a common condition among people with rheumatoid arthritis, affecting roughly one in six people. Yet it often goes undiagnosed. Everyone has spells where they feel a little low. But this often passes when we have a good cry or a heart-to-heart with a friend. On the other hand, depression is a low mood that can last a long time or keeps returning, affecting your everyday life. You might feel sad, hopeless and lose interest in things you used to enjoy. But, worst of all, it can make you feel isolated, like no one could imagine or know what you're feeling.For more information on working with arthritis, visit versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/living-with-arthritis/work For tips and advice, visit versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/young-peopleAt times like this it's important to let your loved ones know what you're going through and, if your mood doesn't improve, talk to your doctor. They can signpost you to useful services such as therapy, or they may prescribe you an antidepressant. There are also plenty of small ways you can look after your mental wellbeing and build emotional resilience. For instance, you could: Practice deep breathing or mindful meditation to help reduce any anxiety you may have. Write your thoughts down in a diary to help you make sense of your emotions. Keep active - exercise can give you a boost of feel-good hormones called endorphins. Make time for activities that you enjoy, or which help you relax. Connect with friends - grab a coffee with a friend, have a phone call with a family member or join an online community. If you need a bit of extra support, remember you're not alone. We're here to help you, every step of the way. You might find it helpful to join a Versus Arthritis support group where you can connect with like-minded people and talk about what you're going through. To see if we run a local support group in your area visit versusarthritis.org/in-your-area/ Or you could join our Online Community where you could connect with real people who share the same everyday experiences as you. For more information visit community.versusarthritis.org You can also call the Versus Arthritis Helpline for free on 0800 5200 520 , where our trained advisors can lend a listening ear. versusarthritis.org Helpline 0800 5200 520 33Gadgets and equipment If you have trouble doing everyday tasks, you may find it useful to use aids and adaptations. Aids are items of equipment that can help you manage everyday tasks such as bathing, dressing, and cooking. They can include shoehorns, easy-to-use kitchen utensils, and cutlery with large handles. Adaptations are changes made to your home to help you move around. They can include fixed ramps and baths with built-in handles. In England, many people with arthritis are eligible to have aids and adaptions provided, free of charge, by their local authorities. Your council may call this community equipment. To see what you're eligible for, ask your council for a free needs assessment. If you live in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, contact your GP or local council for more support. It varies a lot depending on your needs and where you live.

If you struggle with cold weather, it might help to: Take a warm bath or shower to ease soreness and stiff muscles. Do gentle stretches. Find ways to stay warm - wear scarves and gloves or wrap up with blankets (if you have Raynaud's phenomenon, you may find that your hands and feet are more sensitive to the cold). If you struggle with hot weather: Keep cool and stay in the shade. Wear light, breathable clothing. If you find that your feet swell up a little in hot and humid weather, find a sandal or breathable shoe that gives you support. Wear SPF sunscreen, as some rheumatoid arthritis drugs can make your skin sensitive to sunlight.

But there are things you can do to maintain intimacy and relationships, and to have an enjoyable sex life. Talk openly with your partner about how you feel. Try to plan intimacy around times of the day when you generally feel better. Or take painkillers about half an hour before having sex. Try different positions. If one position puts a strain on your joints, try experimenting with others. You could use cushions, pillows or furniture to support you too. Have a warm bath or shower beforehand to ease your joints. Pregnancy, fertility and breastfeeding It's completely natural to be nervous about how rheumatoid arthritis will affect pregnancy. But if your condition is under control there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to get pregnant and have a baby. As with any pregnancy, planning ahead will make you feel more comfortable and in control. Remember it's never too early to start the conversation with your doctor so that you can get on the right treatment plan. Once you speak to your doctor, you may be referred to an obstetric rheumatology clinic. This may be something your local hospital offers, or you may be referred to a nearby specialist centre.For more advice, check out our Sex, relationships and arthritis booklet or visit versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/living-with-arthritis/sex-relationships-and-arthritis/ If you're already on a pregnancy-friendly drug, you won't have to worry about coming off it or switching medications when you decide to start trying for a baby. We know that it's not always possible to plan ahead though. In this case, it's important to let your rheumatology team know as soon you become pregnant. They can check everything is fine and make sure you're on the right medication. There's no specific reason why having rheumatoid arthritis should affect your ability to breastfeed. Some drugs, such as methotrexate, can pass through the breast milk though, so just make sure you discuss which drugs are best to take with your healthcare team beforehand.

Our previous research has: led to the development of a new class of drugs, known as biologics, which have transformed the treatment of inflammatory arthritis and improved the lives of almost 2 million people worldwide. At first, biologics were only used to treat severe cases of inflammatory arthritis, but now they have been approved to treat moderate rheumatoid arthritis, allowing thousands more people to use these treatments. showed that early, intensive treatment for inflammatory arthritis, started within 12 weeks of symptoms starting, increases the chances of remission, as well as reducing pain and long-term joint damage. We're currently funding research projects to find out what causes rheumatoid arthritis, and to develop new and improved treatments. For example: Our Centre for Genetics and Genomics Versus Arthritis is trying to understand how genetic factors play a role in whether people are at risk of developing inflammatory arthritis. Our Research into Inflammatory Arthritis Centre Versus Arthritis (RACE) is looking at why rheumatoid arthritis starts, why it attacks the joints, and why the inflammation carries on rather than switching off. Our researchers are developing an online tool to help people with rheumatoid arthritis stay active. Our researchers are investigating how changes to the bacteria that live on the gut can lead to rheumatoid arthritis in people who are considered at risk. 39 38 versusarthritis.org Helpline 0800 5200 520Where can I find out more?
