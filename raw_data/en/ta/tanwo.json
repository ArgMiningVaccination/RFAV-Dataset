I think that a lot of people here are confusing a patents ability to motivate development with patents being the ONLY way to motivate development. Patents have some advantages, such as that they tend to pay out in direct relation to how good the invention is. But they have some disadvantages, too. The benefit of the patent comes from the monopoly granted by the state, and monopolists make money by raising the price over the cost by restricting supply. That is pretty much always bad for society, and is particularly bad when we are talking about a product that we want distributed as widely as possible. Pricing poor people out of movies and music is kind of douchy, IMO, but pricing them out of medicine is an order of magnitude worse, and pricing them out of medicine that allows a global pandemic to rampage and mutate is perhaps suicidally douchy. If the monoplist isn't pricing a bunch of people out of the product, then he isn't losing sales when he raises the price, so his price is irrationally low. There are ways to partially deal with these effects, but they undermine what a patent is, if you can't use a patent to jack up your prices then you might as well not have one. I don't think many on Ars support impoverishing researchers, but there are perhaps ways other than government enforced monopoly rights to fund them. For example there is no IP allowed in fashion, which is why no one can make any money as a fashion designer, and if you go into a store there is only one kind of wooden shoe that you can buy, but I think that there might exist alternative ways of encouraging variety. Wouldn't it be faster to encourage the companies that developed the vaccines to start manufacturing them internationally, rather than waiving the patent protection and expecting other companies to start manufacturing them? After all, it's not like Pfizer, Moderna and J&J publish all their trade secrets to help other people set up manufacturing. A patent filing only contains some of the information needed to create the vaccine. Copycats who create generic versions of the vaccine will need testing, quality control regulation and stuff like that. It'll take ages for someone else to develop a trustworthy copycat vaccine even if you do get the patents released. I'm not generally in favor of Big Pharma. But in this case waiving the patents seems like a useless move. The answer is no. The reason is you're missing the big elephant in the room here: cost. There are vaccine manufacturing facilities that can make some of the more traditional style vaccines, like J&J. Without the patent restrictions they can also do it for cheaper and closer to the populations to vaccinate. If you think about the main feature of generic medication, what is it? Price. Of course the IP holders can manufacture in other places, but would they do it if it's more profitable to continue the current course of action? No they wouldn't. So doing it at profitable prices means many of the countries in dire need right now can't afford those vaccines, they can only afford the generic version. This whole discussion, as anything related big pharmaceuticals, isn't really about viability, quality, or anything else they bring up as an excuse. As always, it's about money and profits. It's more profitable to be the sole source of brand name vaccine than allow other ones to produce a generic version. Of course you can't outright say that, so you have to make up some more palatable arguments. If it was truly about what they say it is, there wouldn't be so much support by organizations like Doctors Without Borders and other international NGO's. They would in fact be siding with the pharmaceuticals if the real concern was about ineffective and poor quality vaccines giving a false sense of security to vulnerable populations, enabling the virus to get even more rampant and potentially develop a worse variant by exposing it to half ass vaccinated people. I guarantee you the pharmaceuticals aren't spending millions lobbying against this because of humanitarian concerns. I'm supportive of this regardless of what the experts say about the bottleneck. It may not be the specific bottleneck for COVID, though I bet it contributes, but in general patents on lifesaving stuff shouldn't exist. Then life saving stuff wouldn't exist! Businesses would not be willing to spend money and expertise on something that gives no profit. The entire purpose of business is to make profit.

What you are saying has nothing to do with reality. Drug prices in most countries are regulated by the state. There is no free market. And every rich or poor person has access to medicine. The concept of the patents did not prevent anyone from receiving drugs. The US problem with expensive drugs has nothing to do with the concept of patents. Long term it is probably a good idea.TLDR: This isn't about removing a short-term bottle neck in COVID19 vaccines, it's about demanding a move towards equitable sharing of life-saving technologies with wide applications that would empower Africa and parts of Asia that IP holders in the west don't want to empower. Short term, what is the cost of having those resources working to stand up new production instead of working existing production? The solution should be the one that reaches global herd immunity fastest, not one that is ideologically driven. Tech transfer sounds good unless it all goes to hell and we cut back production trying to bring on new production that never materializes and we just added 6 months to the pandemic and thousands to the death toll. It isn't a question with an easy answer. These comments are a mess. Waiving COVID patents is a good thing, especially considering most of the mRNA vaccines we see from Pfizer and Moderna were made with help from government funding. Too often we see pharmaceutical companies socializing the R&D costs of developing drugs by using government research and funding, while privatizing the profits. It's true that tech transfer will be required, but I think that should be stipulated as well as part of the patent waivers. This could help the production of similar vaccines in the future against new variants and other diseases even if that's years away. I'm supportive of this regardless of what the experts say about the bottleneck. It may not be the specific bottleneck for COVID, though I bet it contributes, but in general patents on lifesaving stuff shouldn't exist. Then life saving stuff wouldn't exist! Businesses would not be willing to spend money and expertise on something that gives no profit. The entire purpose of business is to make profit. Sure then ask them how much it cost them to develop. Calculate a rewarding and reasonable return on investment, and pay them X billions for as many doses as they can make in X time that covers both those numbers. Then release the patents to speed up the process of vaccinating everyone. Lives saved / profits made. If you take patents you create a risk with all drugs and vaccines that make them less investable. Roughly only 1 in 1000of products every get to market, but they is no guarantee that anything you research on will work. There are 100s of millions held at risk across a wide number of projects. So it isn't about the success of an individual project because you have to make a reasonable return across all the projects, even the ones where you spend $60 million that never have anything to show.I'm supportive of this regardless of what the experts say about the bottleneck.

The whole reason why the capability to rapidly develop vaccines existed was private sector money. If you remove patents the area becomes uninvestable, so the next pandemic the capability won't be there.Patents are in no way preventing other countries from getting the necessary vaccines. If they removed the patent \"barrier\" this minute, it wouldn't speed up vaccine production for other countries one bit. On the contrary, it would show these pharmaceutical companies that the US Govt can't be trusted when it comes to the incentives it was given under Trump that Biden now wants removed. But then I remembered how the Pharma companies all backed Biden, and intentionally withheld the announcement that the vaccine would be mass produced until 1 week after the election to intentionally help Biden and hurt Trump, and think that these clowns are getting exactly what they deserve. Reap what you sow, Pharma bros. The Moderna vaccine was funded by US government handouts and a large private donation. WTF should Moderna be entitled to profit insanely for decades on a publicly-funded public good? That venture capital money was also accumulated by privatizing the results of public research and then later from ultra-low or no interest loans from the US government (the most recent form of which we call Quantitative Easing). Scratch the surface of any innovation in tech in the last 50 years and you'll find mountains of public cash that paid for the primary research. I scratched the surface and I found scientists from academia who sold their patents to big companies. The concept of patents is the most critical in this process.

The entire medical sector in the US is built on socializing the risk and investment and privatizing the profits. I work in setting up clinical trials and product lines for biologicals including COVID vaccines. Patent blocks are not the issue. Capacity is. Similar to fab production reported extensively on Ars for microchips, there's only so many places that can reliably mass produce vaccine at scale, and even then it doesn't always go smoothly (see: Emergent Biosolutions) to create large volumes of vaccine free from contamination at correct concentrations. My two cents. From what I've heard through the grapevine, lipid production (for the encapsulating layer around the mRNA vaccine particles) was the initial bottleneck for both Pfizer and Moderna. At the start of this process, there was only one company that had the equipment and know-how to produce it in any sort of volume, and even then they only made it in volumes sufficient for the R&D work that they had been supporting up to that point. I don't know how their process works specifically, but many, many biotech production processes are *extremely* finicky and don't scale up to larger batch sizes and equipment in the ways that you would intuitively expect them to. It's not just a case of needing to share the IP behind the process so that contract manufacturers can help scale up production. Without the same equipment, being operated in the same ways by people with the same knowledge of the quirks of the process, it can be hard to get cell cultures to behave as you want them to. So how come the majority of the vaccines developed occurred outside the US public funding then.Moderna wouldn't exist without venture capital funding.

I scratched the surface and I found scientists from academia who sold their patents to big companies. The concept of patents is the most critical in this process. The public funding that made the scientists' research possible in the first place is conspicuously absent from your little bedtime story. Also, I've worked in an NSF lab. It's not the scientists that usually end up with the lion's share of the money, it's the executives who tend to not have any scientific background. That gives the lie that any of this is a meritocracy. That's even before we get to the graduate and undergraduate student lab techs that also do the yeoman's work on this kind of research and seldom end up with their names on patents. The revolving door of abuse and burnout I've seen in primary cell biology research labs would turn your stomach.

The entire medical sector in the US is built on socializing the risk and investment and privatizing the profits. If you accept Yancopoulos' analysis, what you say has no coherence. Pharmaceutical companies do NOT receive state grants In other words, if the US government wants to abolish the concept of patents, she can impose the following condition: Whoever receives state grants also transfers the rights of potential patents. But this is essentially a renegotiation of researchers' remuneration terms. It does not concern the pharmaceutical companies. It has to do with how much American society believes researchers should be paid. Researchers (directly and indirectly) become the patent owners. So how do you explain the vaccines developed in Germany, France and the UK.I'm supportive of this regardless of what the experts say about the bottleneck.

Here the best analysis in youtube: [https://youtu.be/u4SBbCR4LWQ?t=500] you say \"pharmaceutical companies socializing the R&D costs of developing drugs by using government research\". No! Pharmaceutical companies do not do research. They buy patents from researchers from institutions and small research companies( that are usually owned by scientists from the academia). The researchers sell their patents on the open market. If you want to abolish patents you should prohibit researchers from selling their patents. Patents are part of their remuneration.

My two cents. Yep, the patents are irrelevant. It is the knowledhe in the heads of thousands of technicians and engineers and chemists and biologists in the entire production chain leading up to the final product in a glas vial. Also do not discount the cumulative blood, sweat and tears in building up the awesome logistics and procedures to make everything work. Good move that should've been done earlier, but great nonetheless. Why? Seriously - why? Do you believe it will unleash a flood of vaccines? Experts - including those who don't stand to make any money on this - don't think it will help *at all*. Or are you opposed to the idea that the companies that invested money to create these vaccines should be allowed to make money above the cost of production? If you oppose this because you think patents aren't really the problem, please read the [MSF FAQ]linked in the original article if you haven't already. There are dozens of barriers to scaling up vaccine production, and intellectual property is only a small part. But it does play a role, and there is almost no downside for emergency licensing. Also, just look at the [map of those opposing this proposal]. At this point it's El Salvador and Brazil in the Americas (both right-wing governments currently), Singapore, and then the \"first\" world (Japan, Australia, the EU, but no longer the US). It takes a lot chutzpah to think that the thousands of PhDs and health departments in the hundred+ countries supporting this are all totally ignorant of the \"patents aren't the real problem\" argument.

I do not think that is the case. This is misleading.The claim that IP enabled the breakthrough of COVID-19 medicines and vaccines is misleading. Public sector resources, philanthropic funding and the common cause of ending a deadly pandemic have been the main drivers of the unprecedented research efforts to date. Probably at some point, the US government funded (directly or indirectly) Weissman and Kariko , but not the \"devilish\" Pfizer or Modern or BioNTech. The federal government's deal with Pfizer would pay for the purchase of the company's vaccine if it gets FDA emergency use authorization or approval. So Pfizer hasn't gotten any Warp Speed funding yet. With Moderna and other companies, by contrast, the government is helping to fund the vaccines' development and various efforts to scale up manufacturing. The biggest bottleneck is the US ban on vaccine exports and nano lipids. Biden can solve that at a stroke of pen, but he doesn't. It's almost like the Biden administration is using patents to distract from the fact.I work in setting up clinical trials and product lines for biologicals including COVID vaccines.

Also do not discount the cumulative blood, sweat and tears in building up the awesome logistics and procedures to make everything work. The parents *are* the knowledge. Making vaccines is not rocket science. And we're not talking a sudden increase in production tomorrow; we're talking the next year or the year after that. Remove patents and you will increase capacity. (Obviously, if this is wrong and there is never any more capacity other than what current pharma provides, then why is anyone worrying about removing patents in the first place?) As for that *blood, sweat and tears* remark - would you really rank that above the blood, sweat and tears from the countless millions that will die from this disease before they're vaccinated? (Do people honestly think that the Biden administration didn't think about these things before making the announcement?) Wouldn't it be faster to encourage the companies that developed the vaccines to start manufacturing them internationally, rather than waiving the patent protection and expecting other companies to start manufacturing them? After all, it's not like Pfizer, Moderna and J&J publish all their trade secrets to help other people set up manufacturing. A patent filing only contains some of the information needed to create the vaccine. Copycats who create generic versions of the vaccine will need testing, quality control regulation and stuff like that. It'll take ages for someone else to develop a trustworthy copycat vaccine even if you do get the patents released. I'm not generally in favor of Big Pharma. But in this case waiving the patents seems like a useless move. The answer is no. The reason is you're missing the big elephant in the room here: cost.

They would in fact be siding with the pharmaceuticals if the real concern was about ineffective and poor quality vaccines giving a false sense of security to vulnerable populations, enabling the virus to get even more rampant and potentially develop a worse variant by exposing it to half ass vaccinated people. I guarantee you the pharmaceuticals aren't spending millions lobbying against this because of humanitarian concerns. You assume that generics would drive prices down which given the production shortages is unrealistic. This isn't an issue of India or South Africa not being able to afford the vaccines produced outside their countries. There is no glut of vaccines sitting on shelves because no one can afford them (there are some already purchased sitting on shelves due to vaccine hesitancy but that is a separate issue.) Astra-Zenica in fact is mandated by their agreement with Oxford to sell the vaccine at cost. In that admittedly limited case the invalidation of that patent would actually allow generic manufacturers to sell the vaccine at a higher price. This is already happening in India with Sputnik. Private orgs have purchased Sputnik vaccines from Russia and are reselling them outside the government vaccine system in private clinics to those that can afford them. South Africa and India do not have facilities nor expertise standing by to produce these vaccines. The Waiver is an attempt by governments that have badly fumbled vaccine rollout and lifted restrictions early (at least in Indias case) to deflect blame. If the waiver is granted most likely nothing would change. If anything did change it would probably be a large number of profiteering private entities producing low quality or fake vaccines and selling them in the private sector to desperate people. If people in the US and Europe really want to do something to help with the situation in India and throughout the world where Covid is less controlled they would need to release the strangle hold on those vaccines being produced and slow vaccination efforts in these wealthier countries to get doses to nations that have fallen behind by not being able to outbid the US. Of course no one is willing to suggest that some of the limited supply go instead to nations in greater need and that the US slow it's roll on reopening so the theatrics of patent waivers are used instead. I'm all for Biden pushing for the waiver even if it won't help much, it's optics at this point. But alot more good could come from sending a few million doses to India or South Africa from our stockpiles as we shift from supply restriction to demand restriction in our own vaccination efforts. South Africa and India do not have facilities nor expertise standing by to produce these vaccines. I work in setting up clinical trials and product lines for biologicals including COVID vaccines. Patent blocks are not the issue. Capacity is. Similar to fab production reported extensively on Ars for microchips, there's only so many places that can reliably mass produce vaccine at scale, and even then it doesn't always go smoothly (see: Emergent Biosolutions) to create large volumes of vaccine free from contamination at correct concentrations. My two cents. I can see the huge level of problems that could arise without control over the process, the Russians making a crappy version of the pfizer vaccine and the Russian pressuring other governments to purchase it (or the promise of bargain prices) meaning the rollout wouldn't be as efficient. And that's what really matters, efficiency rather than cost at this point (although both are nice) But one thing that concerns me, Astrazeneca and Oxford have basically licensed to all and sundry for free and it's the most common vaccine, particularly with SII making it. But it's not the best vaccine. Could those production lines have been used for a better vaccines if only the licensing allowed them to? If SII was able to make a billion pfizer vaccines instead of AZ, would that have made the world better off? I still don't think removing patents is the solution, definitely not to a pandemic. The various governments threw billions at pharma companies, they could have attached some common sense provisions in place while they were at it. It's not \"removing patents\", it's issuing a temporary waiver for extraordinary circumstances (such as a global pandemic) and the process was already agreed to the well-established and highly touted, international \"Intellectual Property\" agreement/treaty in which the worlds nations have already agreed to a common \"Intellectual Property\" framework, and to recognize and respect each others \"Intellectual Property\" -- and to relax relevant IP restrictions in extraordinary circumstances. (IIRC, the example of medical IP in national or global emergencies (like epidemics) was specifically talked about as one reason that such waivers needed to be allowed for and included in the treaty.

Patent blocks are not the issue. Capacity is. Similar to fab production reported extensively on Ars for microchips, there's only so many places that can reliably mass produce vaccine at scale, and even then it doesn't always go smoothly (see: Emergent Biosolutions) to create large volumes of vaccine free from contamination at correct concentrations. My two cents. I can see the huge level of problems that could arise without control over the process, the Russians making a crappy version of the pfizer vaccine and the Russian pressuring other governments to purchase it (or the promise of bargain prices) meaning the rollout wouldn't be as efficient. And that's what really matters, efficiency rather than cost at this point (although both are nice) But one thing that concerns me, Astrazeneca and Oxford have basically licensed to all and sundry for free and it's the most common vaccine, particularly with SII making it. But it's not the best vaccine. Could those production lines have been used for a better vaccines if only the licensing allowed them to? If SII was able to make a billion pfizer vaccines instead of AZ, would that have made the world better off? I still don't think removing patents is the solution, definitely not to a pandemic.

The more people who understand mRNA vaccines, the better. I am highly dubious that temporarily suspending the patents will ever actually lead to more vaccine production for COVID, but it may. So, go right ahead. And honestly if it leads to some countries better understanding mRNA vaccines, that sounds like it is better for the world (though my understanding is the information would be publicly available anyway if they put a patent on it. Can't file a patent under seal and secrecy). But just because a paten is public and suspended, doesn't mean the patent contains every single step and secret sauce in how it was produced. Which is half of why I am skeptical about this doing anything. Freely licensing AND assisting in manufacturing setup is what would really speed things up a ton and have a chance at seeing increased production sometime in the next 12-18 months. The biggest bottleneck is the US ban on vaccine exports and nano lipids. Biden can solve that at a stroke of pen, but he doesn't. It's almost like the Biden administration is using patents to distract from the fact.I work in setting up clinical trials and product lines for biologicals including COVID vaccines.

My two cents. Yep, the patents are irrelevant. It is the knowledhe in the heads of thousands of technicians and engineers and chemists and biologists in the entire production chain leading up to the final product in a glas vial. Also do not discount the cumulative blood, sweat and tears in building up the awesome logistics and procedures to make everything work. The parents *are* the knowledge. Making vaccines is not rocket science. And we're not talking a sudden increase in production tomorrow; we're talking the next year or the year after that. Remove patents and you will increase capacity. (Obviously, if this is wrong and there is never any more capacity other than what current pharma provides, then why is anyone worrying about removing patents in the first place?) As for that *blood, sweat and tears* remark - would you really rank that above the blood, sweat and tears from the countless millions that will die from this disease before they're vaccinated? (Do people honestly think that the Biden administration didn't think about these things before making the announcement?) Denmark, Austria, and Israel have also entered into a a production agreement.I work in setting up clinical trials and product lines for biologicals including COVID vaccines.

Not only that, but Pfizer uses about $25 billion worth of equipment in 3 factories to do the manufacturing, and that doesn't even count the vendor that makes the lipids for them. Places like India and Africa don't have that kind of cash, and if they did it would take years before the stuff they ordered was delivered. The Australian Government is in the process of finalising plans to build an mRNA production facility locally, we're not expecting it to be running for at least 18 months. They are injecting a bunch of money to make it happen, and I have no doubts that this is not possible in many places around the world. [Austria and Denmark forge 'vaccine alliance' with Israel] Construction will start in September iirc in Denmark. Many countries are discussing building vaccine production facilities in-country because of how distribution has proceeded world-wide. If invoking the TRIPS public health patent waiver reduces some of the barriers involved for countries to do this, that is a good thing. Yes, it will take years to get started. But this pandemic is not over now nor in the next few months. It will take years of concentrated effort to get the whole world out of this.
