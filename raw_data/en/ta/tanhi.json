What is the Center of It All, of all Being in regards to your spiritual nature?", "sitename": "Learn Intuition with Dr Lesley Phillips", "date": "2017-03-18", "cleaned_text": "| [Embed](#) Are You Still Slightly Confused About Who You Are, Spiritually? More than just being a spiritual person, your spiritual nature is the truth of who you are, always have been, and always will be. So what is it then and why is it so important? These are two questions you may ask if you have not truly experienced your spiritual awakening. Don't panic or get upset. We have all had some form of a challenge when it comes to this area of areas of personal growth spiritually. Also, we all have our own words to describe spirituality or even a spiritual person meaning. As a spiritual person, it is all about answering the question of what is spirituality to you in your way. Take a moment and consider the spirituality definition, the true inner meaning that comes to you. What Is Spiritual Growth When you begin the journey along your spiritual way, another word for spiritual enlightenment, so many questions come up. Have you ever asked yourself, \"What or who is at the center of it all?\" Even where do you fit into the whole scheme of things in this large universe and eternity? You cannot broach this subject without considering spirituality and possibly the existence of a [higher power](https://drlesleyphillips.com/podcast/how-to-find-god/). Many different answers can come to mind. As for who or what is at the center of it all most of you would you respond with God or the Universe, and in essence, you all would be correct. Your Spiritual Nature As A Spiritual Person There is, however, more to it than just the one definition. Your spiritual nature is very pertinent when pondering this query. Many of us first start on our oath and we externalize God's nature. Then, of course, this would, in essence, have you deny any sense of personal \"godness\" within you. The consensus would be that God is external to you. This would, in turn, be a major factor in determining the opinion you would adopt of your true spiritual nature. It stands to reason that one of the main factors in coming to this conclusion is the consideration of your religious belief structure. This learned religious belief system is a strong motivator for many aspects of your spiritual and corporal life. The thought that you are the center of it all may contradict much of what you have set as your religious parameters. The thought of this could send many an individual into a state of guilt requiring, in their eyes, some sort of [forgiveness](https://drlesleyphillips.com/podcast/forgive-and-forget/) and even repentance. What Is Spirituality Then? This is about when we need to look at and examine the statement we hear so many new age practitioners use, 'what does I am spiritual but not religious mean.\" This comes into play concerning your spiritual nature as a spiritual person and what you determine that is. The difference between religion and [spirituality](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/we-are-not-human-or-spiritual-we-are-both_us_58ea6bc2e4b0acd784ca5981) has been on the metaphysical and mainstream religion debate floors for quite a while now. The stand that most religions take is that as a spiritual person we cannot take on the nature of God but just represent it. God is a separate entity! The concept is that God is everywhere and everything but not 'us'. [Adhering to the idea that you are god would be blasphemy and mean the destruction of your good standing with \"The Creator\". In the Metaphysics realm, we believe that we are all part of God, the universe, or whatever name you wish to give this greater power and all forms of spirituality have merit. We all came from, remain with, and will return to this entity as a part of the whole. Some people do not consider that the definition of spirituality contains much to do about what your belief of this entity might be.](https://drlesleyphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/How-To-Find-Your-Own-Spirituality.jpg) Spiritual Growth Quotes Yet let's look at some biblical quotes since Christianity is still the largest of the world's religions. Ephesians 2:22...\" in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.\" Luke 17:21 ...\"Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\" 2 Timothy 1:14...Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you. 1 Corinthians 3:16...\"Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?\" John 14:23...Jesus answered and said to him, \"If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our abode with him.\" Ephesians 3:17...\" so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and grounded in love,\" It is all about who you are within your being. That the 'Spiritual You' is the 'True You' having a physical journey. This belief is that the center of who you are is a deity and you actually have the power of God but just do not know how to wield it, or do you? Some people can create so much good just because they will it. They put it in motion. And we also have the power to create negativity. You create your reality! Sickness or health, rich or poor, happy or sad you write the script. How To Find Your Own Spirituality As for a way to find your way to the recognition of who you truly are is through personal reflection. This can also be called meditation which is not only one of the most excellent [personal development activities but also one of the best daily spiritual practices you can follow to get in touch with your true spiritual nature. This is where you will find peace, harmony, happiness, and even some interesting spiritual gifts called psychic powers.](https://drlesleyphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/How-To-Find-God-Without-Religion.jpg) Spirit, the core of who you are, is not bound by time or space. Spirit can travel the astral plane. It can go back in time. It can see the future. It can read people's hearts and minds. Spirit can communicate with all beings alive or passed on. So how do you define spirituality and the ultimate power that drives the dogma of your personal spiritual journey? Do you feel that this spiritual belief system, your personal spirituality, is in any way compromised if 'The God' does exist, or are you happy believing that if He does He will be all-loving and understand and forgive your misapprehension? This can cause some inner turmoil. However, we discuss this in much more detail in this episode of Unlocking Your Truth.
