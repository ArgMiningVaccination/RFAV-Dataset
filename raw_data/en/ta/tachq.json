Ayurvedic Cleansing: a traditional Ayurvedic practice to feel healthier, release stored toxins, reduce stress in the body, engage in preventive health, and learn lifestyle tools to support holistic wellness. In Ayurveda, it is taught that our bodies, minds, and spirits are significantly impacted during the change of seasons and that preparation for this transition can aid a person to go through it with grace, balance, and flourishing health. Ayurvedic wisdom recommends regular cleansing as a lifestyle twice a year, especially during the major spring and fall seasonal transitions, as long as it's been safely indicated on an individual basis. *We provide an individual health screening for everyone prior to recommending a safe and appropriate customized cleanse program. In a case where cleansing is contraindicated, such as during the postpartum time until one year after giving birth and in certain health conditions like anemia, extreme fatigue and debilitation, we'll recommend a more gentle tonification program for several months or longer to prepare your body for a later time to engage in a deeper cleanse.

Ayurveda 101 Introduction to Ayurveda: the \"Science of Life and Longevity\" Ayurveda is a holistic system of healing that is not founded in any religion and is applicable to any person regardless of their culture, gender, or background. Studying Ayurveda can be helpful to understand the foundation of any other modern system of healthcare. The main eight branches of Ayurveda include pediatrics, gynecology and obstetrics, ophthalmology, toxicology, geriatrics, general medicine, otolaryngology, and surgery. Today we recognize these as the central branches of modern medicine. Further, massage, diet and nutritional counseling, herbal remedies, psychiatry, polarity therapy, shiatsu, acupressure and acupuncture, plastic surgery, color and gem therapy, kinesiology, and meditation also trace their roots to Ayurvedic practice and philosophy. Working with the laws of nature by applying even a few Ayurvedic principles in your life can make a profound difference in the quality of your health and restore imbalance to balance through natural, effective, and time-tested methods. For example, the revered Nasal Rinsing or Neti Pot is a traditional Ayurvedic therapy that is thousands of years old. It safely cleanses the nasal and sinus passages with warm salt water and is now commonly practiced throughout North America. Ayurveda recognizes that our health is significantly influenced by our unique, individual constitution, as well as external factors such as the changing of the seasons throughout the year or work events. Understanding how to best make decisions in balance with the rhythms of nature through the ideas of Ayurveda can greatly improve our ability to heal, quality of life, productivity, and longevity. While there are numerous universal recommendations that anyone can apply in Ayurveda, it is considered essential self-knowledge to receive an individualized Ayurvedic assessment. Ayurveda recognizes that what works for someone may be the complete opposite for another person because what restores health and balance to each person is unique. Thus, Ayurveda is a highly individualized approach that is traditionally taught from teacher to student in a close one-on-one mentorship. The process of undergoing an Ayurvedic assessment at Four Seasons Harmony includes a 90-minute session, pulse reading, tongue assessment, & detailed holistic assessment of your lifelong Ayurvedic constitution, called Prakruti in the Sanskrit language, and temporary health imbalances, or Vikruti. A personalized treatment plan is discussed in follow-up consultations where natural therapeutic recommendations are given while simultaneously teaching you knowledge toward living in optimal health based on the principles of Ayurveda and modern evidence-based holistic health research. After the assessment, your unique lifestyle and nutritional treatment plan to restore wellness is discussed and adapted in regular follow-up consultations over a period of about two years until a level of maintenance is reached. This may include lifestyle adjustments, positive dietary changes, aromatherapy, yoga, self-massage, gentle food-based herbal remedies, exercise, and other natural therapeutics. When you are well established in living an Ayurvedic lifestyle and skilled in applying the concepts independently, consultations transition to meeting less frequently on a seasonal basis. This process is designed to best serve and support your long-term success to realistically maintain health through all of life's seasons.
