There is currently no cure for multiple myeloma, so the goals of treatment are to prolong life, to achieve as strong a response as possible without unacceptable side effects, and to maintain the patient's quality of life at as hi gh a level as possible throughout treatment. We carried out a health technology assessment of different treatment regimens for patients with myltiple myeloma who are refractory to treatmen t, or experience relapse. We included data for five outcomes: overall survival , quality of life, severe adverse events, progression-free survival and discontinuation due to adverse events, with overall su rvival being our main primary outcome.

We grouped treatments into three separate groups, each based on the relevant reference treatment in order to perform the analysis. We used hazard ratios from the network meta-analysis to inform the overall and progression-free survival curves us ed in the model. The results of the health economic analyses were: - In the [R + d] grou p, [R d] had costs of NOK XXXXXXX, with 2.90 QALYs gained. Only two other treatments were not dominated by other treatments : [IR + d] had costs of NOK XXXXXXX, 3.82 d]. the [V + d] group, 2.24 QALYs. [DV + d] was the only other treatment that was not dominated by other treatments, with costs of NOK XXXXXXXXX, 3.63 QALYs, and d]. the [P + d] group, and 0.81 QALYS. [EP + d] was the only other treatment that was not dominated by other treatments, with costs of NOK XXXXXXXXX, 1.39 QALYs, and to [P + d]. It is important to note the substantial uncertainty in the evidence underlying these results. We su ggest putting more weight on comparisons from direct estimate s from randomized trials, when possible. The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis should be considered highly uncertain becaus e of lack of access to patient level data and the larg e degree of uncertainty in the network meta- analysis results which informed our work. Our results cannot be used to determine the best treatment sequencing among relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma patients.

The median age at diagnosis is approximately 70 years, and in cidence is rare among individuals under age 30. Multiple myeloma affects plasma cells in the bone marrow. Because there is currently no cure for multiple myeloma, the go al of treatment is to achieve as strong a response as possible without unacceptable side effects, and to maintain the patient's quality of life at as high a level as possible throughout treatment. Objective To determine the clinical efficacy, safety, an d cost-effectiveness of disease modifying treatments for relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) in a Norwegian context. Efficacy and safety Method We have systematically collected and review ed the evidence for clinical efficacy and safety for disease modifying treatments fo r relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma according to the PRISMA rules. We identified relevant publications from randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) throug h systematic reviews from our previous mapping review, as well as through system atic searches. The inclusion criteria were individuals over 18 years diagnosed with multiple myeloma, who either were refractory to at least one pr evious line of treatment or had experienced one or more relapses. The treatment (intervention) was an y of the drugs listed below, alone or in combination with each other, and/or with a glucocorticosteroid such as dexamethasone, compared with any interventi on-drug alone, or in combination with each other, or in combination with other drugs. 1 Treatments named in the commission and li sted in the project plan (protocol): Abb. Full dru g name D Daratumumab E Elotuzumab F Panobinostat (Farydak) ) 1 Treatment regimens can consist of up to three different drugs in combination, often with dexamethasone (d), and are presented in the text as abbreviati ons, e.g., the triple regimen of [DK + d] consists of daratumumab (D), carfilzomib (K) and dexamethsone (d). Other gl ucocorticoids than dexamethasone can also be used 9 Executive summary The primary outcomes were overall survival, health related quality of life, and severe adverse events, with overall survival be ing our main primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were progression free survival, adverse events, and discontinuation due to adverse events. We used the critical appraisa l of one systematic review from which we included several studies; tw o researchers critically appr aised the remaining included studies. All outcomes were analysed by component network meta-analyses. We present results for the treatment regimens releva nt for Norway, as determined by the Norwegian guideline for multiple myeloma, with results for a ll included treatment regimens in the appendix. We assessed the certainty of ev idence for all outcomes using the GRADE approach (Grading of Recomm endations Assessment, Development and Evaluation), expressing the certainty as high, moderate, low, or very low, depending on the level of confidence we have in the effect estimates. Results We included in total 72 articles from 50 RCTs that studied the effects of various treatment regimens containing one to thre e disease modifying drugs. We performed component network meta-analyses on up to 34 randomised, controlled trials, comprising 12 873 randomized patients, and 31 treatments. The radar plots below illustrate the overa ll safety and efficacy of each treatment regimen across all outcomes. Each individual radar plot presents the available P-scores for the different outcomes, for each treatment regimen, as a polygon (shaded). A P-score expresses the mean extent of certainty that a given treatment regimen is superior to all other regimens included in the underly ing meta-analysis (i.e., with respect to a single outcome such as overall survival). They are informally interpreted as the probability that a treatment is \"best\". A tr eatment with a higher P-score (closer to 100%) could be interpreted to be superior (i .e., longer survival, be tter quality of life, fewer severe adverse events, longer progression-free survival or fewer discontinuations due to adverse events) to a treatment with a lower P-score (closer to 0%). In the radar plots, treatment regimens wi th polygons with larg er areas tend to be superior to those with smaller areas. Howe ver, this interpretation can be misleading because data was not available for all treatments and outcomes: it is therefore possible for a highly effective treatment to have a poly gon with small area due to a lack of data. When comparing results for different treatmen t regimens, one should be careful not to interpret effect based so lely on polygon area. We inferred that there is not a single treatmen t regimen that is superior with respect to all outcomes. Radar plots for the double combination [P + d] exemplify treatment regimens that have polygon with large area . This would indicate better efficacy and safety than treatment regimens with smalle r area polygons, e.g., [DR + d]. However, when looking closer at the individual P-scores , we find that [P + d] have lower P-score for overall survival than [DR + d]. As su ch, we would expect longer survival by treatment with [DR + d] than [P + d]. While radar plots may be useful for understanding tradeoffs between efficacy and safety, they should not be interpreted in isolation. Furthermore, the radar plots do not reflect a ssessments of the certainty of evidence or results of the health economic analysis. We assessed the certainty of evidence (GRADE) for one treatment being better than another, to be mainly low or very low, with a few exceptions. The six triplet combinations [EP + are examples of treatment regimens relevant for non-refractory patients 2 that have clearly favorable hazard ratios for overall survival, that al so are ranked highly with respect to other outcomes. 2 We also present results for patients who are refracto ry for lenalidomide (R) and/ or bortezomib (V) in the report. 10 Executive summary Radar plot of treatment regimens relevant for nonrefractory patients Radar plots show treatment regimens relevant to Norwegian clinical practice. D: daratumumab, d: dexamethasone, Disc.: discontinuation due to PFS: progression free survival (hazard ratio), QLQC30: quality of life (difference in mean score), R: lenalidomide, SAE: severe adverse events (incidence rate ratio), V: bortezomib. The radar plots summarize relative efficacy and safety but do not reflect assessments of the certainty of evidence or results of the health economic analysis. 11 Executive summary Health economic evaluation Method We conducted a cost-utility analysis of 13 tr eatments for patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma in which health effects were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs in Norwegian kroner, and results were presented as incrementals cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We chose to use a partitioned survival analysis model implemented in TreeAge to perform the analysis. Partitioned survival analyses are frequently used to model the cost-effectiveness of cancer treatments because Kaplan-Meier plots of overall and progression-free survival curves from clinical trials can be used to track patien ts through three health states: Progression- free, Progressed, and Dead. Survival Curves and Health States in Partition Survival Analysis OS - PFS = Progressed, PFS = Progression Free, OS = Alive (Progressed + Progression Free) Without access to patient level trial data it is not possible to generate well-fitted survival curves for each treatment in the model. Instead, we used a technique, common in cost-effectiveness analyses, in which a survival curve is generated for the comparator treatment in the analysis and the corresponding curves for interventions of interest are generated by appl ying the relevant hazard rati os from a meta-analysis to the comparator's survival curve. As the ha zard ratios for overall and progression-free survival were taken from the network meta-ana lysis in the clinical effect section of this report, there was not a \"comparator\" in th e normal sense. In a network meta-analysis any treatment can be designated as a \"reference treatment\" since the matrix of results generated by the analysis provides hazard ra tios for each intervention relative to all other interventions. Based on expert advice, we subdivided our economic model into three treatment groups, each based on one of three reference treatments: + d]. Costs for the analysis included: 1) cost of medications, 2) time costs for pharmacy and nursing staff for preparation and administration of medications given by injection or infusion, 3) time costs for doctor visits and tests at regular check-ups, and 4) patients' travel and time costs associated with treatm ent. We were unable to include costs of 12 Executive summary severe adverse events, as they were not report ed consistently in published trial results, but as these are quite small in relation to medication costs, they would not have resulted in meaningful changes in the resu lts. To account for uncertainty associated with the variables included in the model (h azard ratios, utility values for capturing quality-of-life and treatment costs) we ra n the model as a probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 10,000 random draw Monte Carlo iterations. The model also allowed us to calculate absolute shortfall, the variable used to determin e the severity of a disease. We also conducted one-way sensitivity anal ysis to determine which variables had the largest impact on the results. Results We report the cost-effectiven ess results for treatments in each reference group that were not dominated by another treatment. A treatment is considered dominated if it has a higher total cost and lower health effe ct than another treatment. In the [R + d] [R + d] had costs of NOK XXXXXXX, wi th 2.90 QALYs gained. Only two other treatments were not dominated by other treatments: [IR + d] had costs of + [V group, 2.24 QALYs. [DV + d] was the only other treatment that was not dominated by other treatments, with costs of NOK XXXXXXXXX, 3.63 QALYs, and [P d] group, [P + d] had costs of XXXXXXX, and 0. 81 QALYS. [EP + d] was the only other treatment that was not dominated by other treatments, with costs of NOK XXXXXXXXX, 1.39 QALYs, and [P + d]. In addition to providing cost-effectivene ss results, the health economic analysis provided estimates of average absolute shortf all for treatments in each of the reference groups. The values were similar across gr oups and ranged from 12.46 to 14.95 lost healthy life-years. Discussion Efficacy and safety Our report is limited in having few RCTs for each treatment regimen. Because the included studies defined disconnected netw orks, we had to use component network meta-analysis, and were unable to formally test the assumption that the treatments can be modelled in this way. Including immature survival data in our analysis may have introduced bias in our report due to selective reporting of findings. It is likely that more mature data would lead to di fferent meta-analysis results and more certain judgements about the evidence. Most of the included RCTs are international studies, predominately conducted in North America and Europe. However, our overall survival results for both [IR + d] and [DV + d] are based on one small Chinese study and one large international study, where there were differences in the type of treatment of fered to patients who progressed, making it difficult to interpret the findings. There were also ethnic and other differences in the study populations. There have been reported ethnic differences regarding incidence of multiple myeloma and aggressiveness of dise ase. In addition, ethnicity has also been shown to affect drug response in cancer tr eatment in some cancer s. However, we do not know to what extent this does or does not apply to RRMM. Ideally, future studies should directly co mpare the more effective triple regimens, rather than using less effective double regime ns as controls. It may not be possible to power superiority trials comparing treatmen ts of very similar effectiveness, but noninferiority trials may be a useful approa ch when relatively small effect sizes are expected. 13 Executive summary Health economic evaluation There is a great deal of uncertainty connected with the results of the health economic analysis. Some of this uncertainty reflects the fact that we needed to rely on the results of the component network meta-analysis perfor med for the clinical effect section of this report to perform the health economic an alysis. The sources of uncertainty in the network meta-analysis results ha ve been explained in the discussion of clinical effects. Additional uncertainty in the cost-effective ness analysis can be the result of the methods we used to derive the underlying su rvival curves for the reference treatments. The lack of access to patien t level data meant that we were unable to account correlation between progression-free and ov erall survival. This is particularly important because it limits our ability to a ccurately fit the portions of the survival curves beyond what is captured in the trial period. To the extent that we were unable to accurately accoun t for dose reductions during tr eatment, our results may over- estimate treatment costs. Conclusions It is not possible to draw clear, brief con clusions for several reasons including a high degree of uncertainty across most results, the need to consider different outcomes simultaneously, and different considerations across subgroups of patients (e.g., those who are refractory to different drugs). We infer that there is no single treatment regimen that is superior with respect to a ll outcomes. The six triplet combinations [EP + are examples of treatment regimens relevant for non-refractory patients that have clearly fa vorable hazard ratios for overall survival, that also are ranked highly with respect to other outcomes. However, it is important to note the substa ntial uncertainty in the evidence underlying these results. We suggest putting more we ight on comparisons from direct estimates from randomized trials, where they exist. Cost-effectiveness results need to be viewed in the context of each reference group, as comparisons of treatments were not made a cross reference groups. In total, only seven treatments were not dominated by other trea tments. [R + d], [P + d]-group. ICERs eatments ranged from NOK XXXXXXX to NOK XXXXXXXXX. Absolute shortfall fo r patients with RRMM probab ly ranges from 12 to 15 healthy life-years lost. There is a high degr ee of uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness results. 14 Hovedbudskap Hovedbudskap Myelomatose er tilfeller \u00e5rlig i daratumumab karfilzomib X \u00e5r.

The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) was commissioned by the RHA forum to perform a full health technology assessm ent on the pharmacological treatment of multiple myeloma. The commission was based on a proposal submitted by NIPH, the Norwegian Medicines Agency and Sykehusinnkj\u00f8p HF. Upon starting the work, it became evident that the commission was too vague, especially in terms of which multiple myeloma population should be in cluded in the HTA (e.g., newly diagnosed patients eligible for stem cell transplantati on, newly diagnosed patients not eligible for stem cell transplantation, or patients wi th relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma). Based on a recommendation by NIPH, the RHA forum gave NIPH a sub-commission to map the evidence of system atic reviews for the different multiple myeloma populations. The original commission was subsequently revised to a full HTA on the pharmacological treatment of patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma, with a focus on drugs and drug co mbinations that are re levant in Norway. This HTA includes an assessment of clinical efficacy and safety, and a health-economic analysis of the pharmacological treatment of patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.

Desser Project coordinator 24 Introduction Introduction Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma, the second most common ty pe of blood cancer, affects plasma cells in the bone marrow. Plasma cells are a type of white blood cell that produce immunoglobulins, which are complex proteins also known as antibodies. Myeloma cells (malignant plasma cells) produce abnormal M-proteins (monoclonal proteins) rather than normal, functioning antibodies. Clinical important manifestations of multiple myeloma include anemia, osteolytic bone le sions, kidney failure and hypercalcemia.Age and previous monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) are the most important risk factors for the dise ase (1). Approximately 450 new cases of myeloma are diagnosed annually in Norway. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 70 years, and incidence is rare among individuals under age 30 (2). Multiple myeloma is often first suspected when patients experience skeletal pain, anemia, frequent respiratory or other infections, poor kidney function, or elevated calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia ). Diagnosing multiple myeloma that will require treatment 5 involves a bone marrow or tumor biopsy to confirm the presence of malignant plasma cells and tests to confirm in cidence of one or more CRAB criteria: C: hypercalcemia, R: kidney (renal) damage, A: anemia, and B: bone damage involving bone lesions or low bone density (3). Because there is currently no cure for myel oma, the goals of initial and subsequent treatments are to prolong life, to achiev e as strong a response as possible without unacceptable side effects, and to maintain the patient's quality of life at as high a level as possible throughout treatment. Norwegian guidelines recommend the most effective available treatment, given at the dose re commended in supporting clinical studies, based on a patient's age, overall health, and response to earlier rounds of treatment. Dosages can be adjusted downwards in resp onse to side effects. Patients generally require continuous treatment over their rema ing lifetime, with a possibility of short periods without treatment (3). The initial choice of treatment for mult iple myeloma is based on patient age. Individuals under age 70 are usually o ffered high-dose chemotherapy with an autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT, tran splant with patient's own stem cells). The treatment consists of five ph ases: 1) induction, i.e., treatment with myeloma directed 5 In addition to myeloma requiring treatment, th ere are two categories of myeloma ('smoldering multiple myeloma' and MGUS) in which no CRAB criteria are present, but where there is evidence of monoclonal proteins in bone marrow. MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance) is a non-cancerous condition that is considered a precursor of myeloma. There is a 1% annual risk that MGUS will progress to multiple myeloma. Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is diagnosed when le vels of monoclonal protein in bone marrow exceed the MGUS cut-off level but are below the level at which multiple myeloma is diagnosed. SMM patients have an annual 10% risk of developing active MM within the first five years, and an annual risk that declines to 3% over the next five years, and to 1%-2% over the 10-year period after that. [2] In Norway , regular follow-up is recommended for MGUS and SMM patients. 25 Introduction drugs intended to achieve maximum respons e without negatively effecting stem cell harvesting, 2) stem cell harves ting, 3) ASCT, 4) consolidation, often a repeat of the induction treatment, and 5) mainte nance. Treatment involving stem cell transplantation may also be appropriate for very healthy and motivated individuals over age 70 (3). Patients over age 70 or individuals who cannot tolerate or do not wish to undergo the ASCT process are treated with chemotherapy and combinations of medications that inhibit plasma cell division in bone marrow. Patients under active treatment can often be treated at home with regular outpatient follow-up. Pharmacological treatment of multiple myeloma has advanced greatly during the past decades, as several new disease modifying agents with various mechanisms of action have been developed and approved (4). The variety of these new agents have drastically increased myeloma patients' surviv al rate, but also pose a challenge given the complexity of the treatment strategies (4, 5). Therapy often relies on treatment regimens containing one or more disease modifying agents, often in combination with glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone (3). The following drug groups and specific disease modifying agents are used to trea t relapsed, refractory Ending: inostat Both groups of newly diagnosed patients can experience disease remission, symptom relief, and increased survival. Patients ex periencing side effects from treatments receive medications to reliev e symptoms and pain. Radiation therapy can also be used either therapeutically or to control pain. The large and growing number of potential treatment options, involving either a single drug or combinations of multiple drugs, has resulted in complex decisions about treatment paths when patients experience a relapse or become resistant to the current treatment (refractory disease). The objective of this project is to determine the clinical efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of treatments for patients with relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma in a Norwegia n context in order to facilitate decision- making within the context of priority se tting criteria in the Norwegian healthcare system. Priority setting in Norwegian health care Principles for priority setting in the Norweg ian health care sector have evolved over the past 30 years based on recommenda tions from a series of government 26 Introduction commissions.6 Currently, there are three priority criteria for use in HTA at the group level7: the benefit criterion, the resource crite rion, and the severity criterion (6). The benefit criterion: The greater the he alth benefit of an intervention, the greater its priority in the health sector . Health benefit is measured in healthy life years and expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The resource criterion: The fewer reso urces an intervention requires, the greater the priority of the intervention. The severity criterion: The greater the severity of a disease/condition, the greater the priority of the intervention(s) used to treat it. Severity is quantified as \"absolute shortfall\", which is the number of health life years lost if a suggested treatment is not provided. In the context of a health technology assessment it is the difference between expected QALYs remaining for a healthy individual who is currently the same age as the mean age of patients undergoing treatment and the prognosis for expected QALYs at diagnosis of patients who don't receive treatment. In addition to the three priority criteria, de cision-makers considering health technology assessments have the discretion to consider other information, particularly the quality and uncertainty of evidence, and the potential budget consequences of an intervention (6). Although this report is divided into separa te sections\u2014one examin ing clinical efficacy and safety results and the other providing the health economic analysis - it should be noted that these sections must be consid ered together in order to evaluate the treatments under consideration in terms of the three priority criteria. The clinical efficacy and safety section of this repo rt provides the necessary information for establishing the clinical benefit of treatments in terms of gains in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and sa fety considerations. The health economic evaluation section includes that information in the health economic model, along with the cost of resources used in treatments, to determine health gains measured in terms of quality-adjusted life-years, and severity, measured in terms of absolute shortfall. Patient perspectives Multiple myeloma is a disease that impacts heavily on the quality of life of patients who are diagnosed with it, both due to the illne ss itself, and its treatment. Coming to terms with a shortened life expectancy and the chan ge in daily life is challenging, although there is much variation in how patients handle it. Most people have barely heard of the disease before, and the uncertainties around prognosis and treatment can be difficult for both the patients and the surroundings. Information is key for myeloma patients, which means that much effort should be put into ensuring that they receive and unders tand the information that is presented by health care staff. The patient organi zation in Norway (Blodkreftforeningen) recommends that patients avoid attending hospital and treatment appointments alone, to increase the chance that all inform ation is received and understood. The patient representative in our expert gr oup (Olav Lj\u00f8sne, Blodkreftforeningen) has pointed out that many multiple myeloma pati ents are concerned about the time it takes for new treatments to be available in Norway, i.e., that it takes too long time for a drug 6 A report by the Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services (ref) provides an excellent summary of the development of priority setting in the Norwegian health care sector and the rationale behind current priority setting criteria. 7 The same priority criteria for deci sions at the clinical (individual pati ent) level, but the definitions for what constitutes benefits and severity are textual de scriptions rather than quantitatively defined criteria that apply for group level decisions. (ref - same as footnote 6) 27 Introduction that has been developed to be made available for patient treatment. Patients are also concerned about the \" focus by authorities on cost and not on the individual benefit to the patients \", and that the variation in medical needs across individuals is not taken sufficiently into consideration. Furthe rmore, although myeloma patients \" are aware of challenges and uncertainty with new treatments \", the risk with trying new treatments is often seen as less of a prob lem than the disease itself. Since the only known effective treatment for multiple myeloma is medication, access to effective treatment is of utmost importance for the patients, also with regards to quality of life. Our patient representative has emphasized the need for flexible approaches, e.g. allowing the use of \" new treatment at an earlier line than defined initially (often new medicine is approved for 4th or 5th line, while it may have good known/better effect at an earlier stage in the treatment process ... )\". 28 Clinical efficacy and safety Clinical efficacy and safety METHODS This health technology assessment (HTA) has been conducted in accordance with our project plan ( Appendix 2) and the National Institute of Public Health's handbook, \"Slik oppsummerer vi forskning\" (7). We also used the PRISMA NMA checklist for reporting a systematic review involving a ne twork meta-analysis, in our work outlining this HTA ( Appendix 4). Objective To statistically characterize the relative e fficacy and safety of the included treatments and to assess certainty of evidence. Inclusion criteria The inclusion criteria are presented in Table 1 with OS being our main primary outcome. Table 1: Inclusion criteria PICOS Inclusion Population Relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), i.e., individuals over 18 years, diagnosed with multiple myeloma who either are refractory to treatment, or have experienced one or more relapses Intervention Treatment with any of the following drugs, alone or in combination with each other and/or with glucocorticosteroids alone or in combination with each other, or in combination with other drugs Placebo Standard treatment Glucocorticosteroids, e. g., dexamethasone, and prednisone Outcome Primary Overall survival (OS) Quality of life (QoL) Severe adverse events (SAE) Secondary Progression-free survival (PFS) Adverse events (AE) Discontinuation due to adverse events 29 Clinical efficacy and safety Study design Systematic reviews based on randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) RCTs Literature search From systematic reviews We used the systematic reviews included in our published mapping review of March 2020 (8) as the basis to identify random ized, controlled trials (RCT) that were considered relevant for our HTA. In the mapping review, the search for systematic reviews were executed by a research specia list in February 2020 and was performed in Epistemonikos, using only th e search term \"myeloma\". Search for RCTs In addition to RCTs identified through systematic reviews, we performed separate searches for eligible, published, and ongoin g RCTs. An information specialist defined and processed the search terms in collaborati on with the researchers of the team and put terms together in a search strategy ( Appendix 3). The search strategies used a combination of controlled terms, i.e., Medica l Subject Headings (MeSH), Emtree terms, as well as free-text terms with various sy nonyms that reflect the concepts of the population: \"multiple myeloma\", and the gene ric names of relevant pharmaceuticals as listed in our inclusion criteria ( Table 1). The search was conducted in MEDLINE (Ovid) and Embase (Ovid) and include d filters for study design (RCT) and publication year (published after 2017). The search was first conducted in February 2020 (\"search 1\") and then updated in Septembe r Before the thir d search, we contacted relevant firms to confirm that there were no additional publications that met our inclusion criteria. The search strategies are detailed in Appendix 3. Searching for ongoing studies In the database clinicaltrials.gov we limi ted the search strategy to relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma. We limited the recruitment status to \"enrolling by invitation,\" and \"a ctive, not recruiting.\" We limited the trial phase to phase two or three. In the WHO ICTRP Search Portal database, we also limited the search strategy to relaps ed or refractory Multiple My eloma. However, we selected ALL for recruiting status because of the limi ted options provided by the database, but then excluded the studies from clinicaltrial s.gov (based on their NCT-number). There was also a trial limitation here for phase two or three. Finally, in the database EU Clinical Trials Register, there was also a li mitation made in the search strategy for relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma. In the trial status, we selected only the ongoing studies. In this final database, we also limited the trial phase to phase two or three. The search for ongoing studies was updated in May 2022. In this update, we searched in the WHO ICTRP Search Portal data base with equal limitations as above, the search period being from June 2021 until May 2022. The update also included a search in the Clinical Trials database. The limita tion to relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma was maintained, but we did some minor changes in the limit selection on the left side menu in the database. We limited to the following filters under Recruitment: Not yet recruiting, recruiting, enrolling by invitation, active not recruiting, unknown status. We also limited the Study type to Interventional. The se arch strategies are detailed in Appendix 4. 30 Clinical efficacy and safety Article selection The studies included in this HTA were selected in a two-step process. In both steps, two persons worked independently, assessin g articles against the inclusion criteria ( Table 1). In the first step, two persons read all ti tles and abstracts retrieved either through the systematic reviews of our mapping revi ew, or by the literature search. In the second step, all selected references were read in full text by the same two persons to decide which should be included in the HTA. Any disagreements throughout this work were resolved either through discussion or by consulting a third researcher. References from systematic reviews One researcher extracted all publications li sted in the 13 system atic reviews (9-21) included in our mapping review (8). These re ferences were then imported to Covidence (22) for screening of title and abstract (step one) and full text (step two). References from search References from our searches were imported to Rayyan (23) for screening of title and abstract (step one). The select ed references were then imported to Covidence (22) for full text screening (step two). Risk of bias assessment in included studies References from systematic reviews One researcher went through all the systematic reviews from which we included RCTs with regards to risk of bias assessment. We found that one of the systematic reviews: Maiese et al (13) had assessed risk of bias us ing the Cochrane risk of bias tool (24) for several of our included studies. As such, we have used the authors' risk of bias assessment for these studies. References from search For those references where risk of bias was not assessed in Maiese et al (13), we performed our own risk of bias assessmen t. Two researchers in dependently assessed the studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (24). Each study was rated as being at low, unclear, or high risk of bias on seve n domains: selection bi as (random sequence generation and allocation bias), performa nce bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other bias. Any disagree ments were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third researcher. Data extraction One researcher extracted relevant data from full-text articles to Covidence (22). The extracted data were then verified by a sec ond researcher. Disagreements were resolved through discussion, or by consultation with a third researcher or other members of the project team. For two studies providing quality of life (Qol) data (25, 26), we extracted data points from figures showing changes ov er time in the reported QoL index domains using WebPlotDigitizer (27). Data exported from Covidence for meta -analysis were also checked by the statistician. We planned that a second researcher would check any data that needed to be converted by the statis tician; in practice, rather than checking individual data, two researchers reviewed statistical analyses for obvious omissions and problems. Table 2 shows which data were extracted (whe re possible) for each included study: 31 Clinical efficacy and safety Table 2: Data extracted from included studies About Information extracted The study Authors, publication year, study design, country, clinical trial identification number, eligibility criteria, follow-up time, funding source (industry or non- industr y). The participants For each trial arm and each outcome: numbers of participants randomized; numbers of participants included in analyses; average age; percentage of participants who were female; percentage of participants who were Caucasian; diagnosis; disease severity at baseline; percentage of participants who had received previous treatment (including stem cell treatment); average number of relapses. The treatments* For each trial arm: name of treatment (including combinations); posology (incl. dose level, frequenc y, duration, and route of administration ). The outcomes For each pairwise comparison and each outcome: name of relative treatment effect estimate (e.g., HR, RR, OR); point estimate; name of measure of precision (e.g., 95% CI, SE, SD ); precision (e.g., limits of the 95% CI ). The analyses For each pairwise comparison and each outcome: analysis method (e.g., Cox regression, GLM); for cross-over and cluster studies, whether a unit of analysis error was made. * Interventions and comparators . CI: confidence interval, HR: hazard ratio, OR: odds ratio, RR: risk ratio, SD: standard deviation, SE: standard error For studies reporting on the same participan ts (e.g., extension studies), we extracted data with the longest follow-up, to avoid \"d ouble counting.\" In the case of cross-over studies with unit of analysis errors or fa ilure to account for carry-over effects, we extracted data for the first period only. To preserve the randomization used in the included studies and to model the policy of recommending a particular treatment (rather than adhering to it), we extracted and analyzed data following the intention-to-tre at (ITT) principle, i.e., all randomized patients were counted and analyzed in the tr ial arms to which they were allocated. We extracted results for \"modified intention-to -treat analyses\" if we judged that the method used would provide similar estimate s to an ITT analysis. As planned, we excluded \"per protocol\" results. Where relative treatment effect estimates were not provided by the included studies or could not be extracted, we imputed relative treatment effects as described in the next section. While we prespecified the scales of measurement on which we anticipated we would perform each meta-analysis, we planned to use alternatives if necessary. This was the case for the grade 3 and 4 severe adverse events outcome (SAE). We anticipated measuring relative treatment ef fect for this outcome using risk ratios (RRs) of one or more SAE. However, we chose to use incidence rate ratios (IRRs) instead. We chose this approach because there was mo re complete data available on numbers of SAEs (rather than numbers of patients experiencing SAEs, as required for RR), and because duration of follow-up varied sufficientl y among the included studies that we doubted risk ratios would have similar interpretations across tr ials. The Analyses section describes how we imputed IRRs for SAE and the possible limi tations of the approach. We treated data for any adverse events (AEs) in the same way, though chose not to present a meta- analysis for this outcome, as explained in the following section. Relative treatment effects were extracted or impu ted from data presented in primary studies; we did not use data from systematic reviews or publis hed meta-analyses in our meta-analyses, to avoid \"double counting\" patients. 32 Clinical efficacy and safety Analyses Treatment definition To perform meta-analysis, it is necess ary to define the treatments (i.e., the interventions and comparators). This is es pecially important in NMAs because these definitions determine the network topology (i.e ., the treatments that have been directly compared by the included studies). We planned to define a treatment as a unique combination of a nonproprietary active drug name (e.g., bortezom ib) and its posology (dose level, frequency, and route of administration), or, for combinations of active drugs, a unique combination of such. Because we included rela tively few studies, it was not possible to define the treatments as planned, as this would have resulted in a network with few if any connections. Instead, we followed an approach similar to those used in several other meta-analyses (12, 18) and defined a treatment as a unique combination of cytostatic drugs, i.e., we did not distinguish between different dosages, routes of administrati on etc. Further, to form connected networks and facilitate mu ltiple treatment comparison, we chose to define treatments as combinations of compon ents, as described in the next paragraph. This facilitates NMA of disconnected networks, as described in the meta-analysis section below. We defined a component to be either a unique combination of specific cytostatic drugs (similar to our original plan) or a glucocorticosteroid (i.e., dexamethasone or methylprednisolone). This leads to a dist inction between the treatments bortezomib (used alone) and bortezomib plus a glucocor ticosteroid (used together), for example. As a treatment component can comprise mult iple drugs, we use abbreviated names as is common in the literature. Table 3 specifies all treatments (i.e., component combinations) identified after data extracti on, along with the abbreviations we use. Note that some treatments or components may not be included in a specific NMA, for example, due to insufficient or incomplete data. 33 Clinical efficacy and safety Table 3: Definition of treatment regimens and abbreviations Treatment regimens Abbreviation Carfilzomib + Is Isatuximab, dexamethasone IsK + Isatuximab, d Venetoclax, bortezomib and dexamethasone VenV + d That we do not distinguish treatments by posology means that we were unable to include in the meta-a nalysis studies that only compared posologies of the same drug or drug combination. For example, a two-arm st udy that compared low versus high doses of the same drug could not be included in meta-analysis because, from the perspective of our treatment definition, it is a compar ison of two identical treatments. While our meta-analyses are therefore unable to provide synthesized evidence about dose and other aspects of posology, it is possible to narratively summarize such differences. 34 Clinical efficacy and safety Imputation Point estimates of treatment effect and statem ents of precision (e.g., standard errors or confidence intervals) are ne cessary for meta-analysis but were not published or could not always be extracted for all outcomes. We therefore imputed these where necessary, as described below. Estimate s of hazard ratios (HR) fo r OS and PFS were usually available, as these were typically prespecifi ed endpoints of the included studies. We did not plan to impute HRs from statements of median survival and did not do so. If standard error was not available, we imputed it where possible from an extracted confidence interval (after transforming to an appropriate scale, such as log HR) or from a p-value using standard Cochrane methods (28). If a study included arms that compared different posologies of the same drug or a drug combination with distinct drugs or drug combinations, we followe d the recommended approach from the Cochrane handbook and combined arms to create the necessary comparisons (29). For the QoL outcome, we meta-analyzed diff erence in mean EORTC QLQ-C30 score (a composite of several QoL indicators). Report ing on this outcome was relatively poor compared to the \"hard\" outcomes such as OS. Usable point estimates were available for arm-wise means, but statements of precis ion (e.g., standard errors or confidence intervals) were often lacking or unsuitable for use in meta-analysis. Where practicable, we imputed standard error on difference in mean score by assuming a common standard deviation for all included studies. This assumed value was taken from Stewart 2015 (30). To evaluate whether this approach is reasonable, we used the imputed standard errors to compute statements of precision corresponding to those published in some of the included studies on QoL. Fo r example, we used an imputed standard error to compute the p-value that the study would have reported under the assumption that our standard error was the same as in the study, and then compared that value to the published p-value. Where it was possible to make these comparisons, there was reasonable agreement. Howeve r, our approach can only provide approximate standard errors on difference in mean EORTC QLQ-C 30 score, so our meta-analytical estimates for this outcome should be interpreted ca utiously with this limitation in mind. As described in the data extraction section, we meta-analyzed SAEs and AEs using IRR. IRRs were not reported by the included studie s, so it was necessary to impute using the available information. An incidence rate is expressed in units of number of events per unit time per patient (e.g., SAEs per 1000 pati ent-years). An IRR is simply the ratio of two such rates (and is therefore unitless) . IRR can be estimated from numbers of events (which were published and extracted) and total exposure times (which were not published). It is not appropriate to impute to tal exposure as the product of sample size and trial duration because some patients die or are otherwise lost to follow-up during a trial: this approach could result in IRR bein g heavily biased in favor of an ineffective treatment on which few events are observed because patients are not alive to experience them. We imputed expected tota l exposure (and hence point estimates of IRR) as follows. Let e 1 and e2 denote the number of events in arms 1 and 2, n1 and n2 denote the number of patients randomized to 2, and E[ T1] and E[ T2] denote expected OS in arms 1 and 2. The total exposure times under the two treatments can be approximated by n 1 E[T1] and n2 E[T2]. A point estimate on IRR can then be imputed using: IRR E E E E The expected OS are unknown, but the ratio E[ T2]/E[T1] can be imputed using a HR for OS under the assumption that survival times follow distributions that are approximately exponential. The distributions ar e unlikely to be exactly exponential, so the approach can be expected to introduce so me bias to estimates of IRR. However, we judged the imputation necessary because, given that SAE is a patient-important 35 Clinical efficacy and safety outcome, we considered it preferable to pe rform a limited evidence synthesis than no evidence synthesis. Standard error on IRR (u sed to obtain confiden ce intervals in the meta-analysis) is a function of event counts e1 and e2. That is to say it is independent of the sample sizes and the imputed ratio of mean survival times and is not subject to bias due to the assumptions made above. Because our estimates of HR for OS are subject to uncertainty (e.g., due to the sampling error in the original studies), we propagated this error to the standard error on IRR to accoun t for the additional uncertainty (i.e., to ensure that confidence intervals on IRR are not excessively precise). This likely also has a mitigating effect on the assumption that survival times are approximately exponentially distributed. We used the same approach to impute IRRs fo r AEs. As this outcome is less relevant for the health economic analysis, and AEs are, by definition, less important than SAEs, we chose not to report this data to limit th e degree to which the imputation described above may lead to misinterpretation. Finally, we imputed risk ratios for discont inuation due to adverse events following standard Cochrane procedures (28). Missing data and unit of analysis errors We planned not to impute missing outcome data (i.e., for patients lost to follow-up) and did not do so. We planned to account for possible bias that missing outcomes may have introduced into the data extracted from th e included studies in our risk of bias and GRADE assessment. With respect to the outcomes whose relative treatment effects had to be imputed from extracted data (i.e., QoL, SAE, AE, and disc ontinuation), we did not attempt to account for possible unit of analysis errors to ad just for randomization above the level of patient), which would require additional assumptions about intraclass correlations. Statistical analyses Except as explained, we performed all statis tical analyses as planned in our protocol (Appendix 2) (31). Studies included in the statistical analyses Some studies with more than two arms coul d not be included in meta-analysis because they compared different posologies of the same treatment (i.e., were comparisons of identical treatments under our treatment de finition). The remaining studies with more than two arms were reduced to single comp arisons using the method described in the Imputation section. Assessment of possible publication bias We planned to assess the possibi lity of publication bias for each primary outcome using funnel plots, however this was not possible due to the small number of included studies and lack of support for \"comparison-adju sted\" funnel plots under the meta-analysis model and software used (detailed below). We are therefore unable to comment on the degree to which studies may have been published or withheld because they showed favorable or unfavorable results. Network metaanalysis We planned to use contrast- or arm-wise network meta-analysis (NMA), or component NMA if we were unable to define treatments as planned. The latter was indeed the case. Further, the networks of evidence for all outcomes were disconnected and the use of component NMA allowed us to address this issue, as explained below in the next section. NMA is a nontrivial area of statistics, but widely used within health technology assessment and the multiple myeloma literatu re. The following discussion attempts to provide a useful non-statistical summary of the methods we used. However, it is not 36 Clinical efficacy and safety possible to provide a complete and unambiguous introduction without using mathematical notation and assuming a reasonab ly high level of statistical competence. Readers are referred to the statistical literature. A set of included studies that each comp are two or more of a set of multiple interventions (e.g., treatments or comparators named A, B, C, etc.) can be considered as a network. For example, if Study 1 comp ared treatments A and B, and Study 2 compared treatments B and C, these studies form the simple network A BC. In general, networks of evidence are more comp lex. Further, if rela tive treatment effect estimates are available from Studies 1 and 2, then the relative treatment effect of A versus C \u2014 which no study has estimated via direct comparison \u2014 can be estimated via a NMA model under appropriate assu mptions (discussed further below). Importantly, in addition to providing poin t estimates for all treatment comparisons, NMA models account for uncertainty arising from the included studies and the network topology (e.g., they provide confidence in tervals for all treatment comparisons). In other words, if two treatments that have not been directly compared are \"far apart\" in the network, and multiple estimates must be combined to estimate a treatment effect for them, the confidence interval provided by the NMA will reflect the totality of the uncertainty. All else being equal, confidence intervals will necessarily be wider for treatments that are \"far apart\" than for treatments that are \"closer\". The key assumption under a fixed effects NMA model is that relative treatment effects can be combined linearly (i.e., added or subtracted) on an appropriate scale (e.g., log HR, on which the multiplicative effect of HRs becomes additive on the log HR scale). The equivalent assumption under a random effects model (as used in this report, see below) is that average relative treatment effects ca n be combined linearly. This distinction is important \u2014 it should not be assumed that we are simply combining the estimates from studies without accounting fo r heterogeneity (differences in treatment effects due to differences in po pulations, study methods, etc.). Dealing with disconnected networks of evidence The approach described above assumes that th e network is fully connected, as in the ABC example. However, if this is not true, as in the disconnected network AB CD, it is not possible to estimate th e relative treatment effect for the A versus C comparison. This is because at least three treatment effect estimates are needed to estimate the six possible pairwi se comparisons, but only two estimates are available. There are therefore infinitely many solutions to the underlying mathematical problem. The problem of disconnected networks can be addressed using component NMA (32) providing: 1. the treatments can be co nsidered to be combinations of components; and 2. the disconnected networks have components in common; and 3. the effect of a combination of comp onents can be modelled as linear. As explained in the Treatment definition section, we modelled treatments as combinations of \"active\" drug and gluc ocorticoid components. For example, the treatment daratumumab (D) and bortezomib (V) and dexamethasone (d) is denoted [DV + d]. This treatment is modelled us ing components: a daratumumab and bortezomib component (DV), and dexamethas one (a glucocorticoid component) (d). The use of the plus (+) symbol in treatment na mes is used to indicate which parts of the treatment are modelled as distinct components. The notation also hints that the \"additional effect\" of each component is mo delled linearly on an appropriate scale (log HR, say). The assumption that the effects of components can be modelled linearly must be made conceptually and ideally tested when po ssible. Such an assumption should be 37 Clinical efficacy and safety considered carefully in the face of disconne cted networks, which may be explained by important differences between populations. Here , the word \"population\" is used in its statistical rather than lay sense. A disconnected network could arise because th e definition of the population used to identify the studies included in meta-analysis is incorrect in the sense that it would not be possible \u2014 in principle \u2014 to design a study that co uld make comparisons across the disconnected parts of the network. (Many studies can be designed in principle but cannot be run in practice \u2014 e.g., because they would be too expensive, or too few patients could be recruited to achieve the necessary power.) We planned to use component NMA if the network of evidence was disconnected. Upon finding this was the case we reevaluated our inclusion crite ria and the included studies to judge whether we had inco rrectly defined the population (i.e., to determine whether it would be more appropriate to perfor m meta-analyses of each fully connected network). We based our judgement on a reconsideration of the original PICO, input from our clinical expert, the Norwegian guid elines for choosing among the available treatments for myeloma, and other systematic reviews and NMAs on myeloma. Based on this reevaluation we considered all include d studies as part of a single disconnected network (for each outcome). Unfortunately, it was not possible to forma lly test the assumption of additivity that underpins the component approach due to the network topologies. However, before adopting the component approach we compared estimates from regular (non- component) NMAs for the subnetworks to th ose from component NMAs for the entire (disconnected) network. The estimates were e ssentially identical. This provides some assurance that the component model is appropri ate. However, it is not possible to test the assumption between the subnetworks. Re sults of the meta-analyses should be interpreted with this limitation in mind. Modelling heterogeneity As planned, we performed a component NMA for disconnected networks using the model proposed by R\u00fccker et al. (32) (this paper provides full mathematical details on the model we used), and as implemented in version 1.3 of the netmeta add-on package for R (33). We assumed random effects for all outcomes, i.e., we estimated average relative treatment effects (rat her than common effe cts, as in a fixed effects analysis) and the extent to which these vary across stud ies (heterogeneity). This is of relevance to the treatment components model and the choice to use a single glucocorticoid component (rather than to model dexamethasone and methylprednisolone as distinct components): our model estimates an averag e effect of a glucocorticoid component, which can vary by study, hence accounting fo r possible differences in effect of the two glucocorticoids and their possibly differing effects when used in combination with \"active\" drugs. Where possible, we summarized heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic and 95% confidence intervals on that statistic, as reported by the netymeta package. Assessment of transitivity NMAs assume that treatment effects are tran sitive. In plain langua ge, this means that treatment effects can be adde d and subtracted to calculate other treatment effects, providing this is done on an appropriate scal e (e.g., log HR rather than HR). It is the transitivity assumption that allows indirect treatment effects (i.e., those not studied by any trial) to be estimated. Note that there is an important difference between treatment effects (i.e., estimation targets, which are un known and can only be estimated) and treatment effect estimates (i.e., trial results). The transitivity assumption must therefore be assessed conceptually. It is also ne cessary to consider differences in the distributions of effect modifiers across the included studies. An earlier version of this report was cr iticized by our clinical expert regarding differences in patient characteristics between the networks, particularly with respect to refractory status and the nu mber of lines of treatments they have received. Our 38 Clinical efficacy and safety understanding of this argument is that an NMA is threatened if the included studies differ in patient characteristics. Papers on NM A aimed at non-statistical readers tend to frame discussion about threats to the assump tions that underpin NMAs in terms of differences in patient characteristics, so it is not surprising that we received this criticism. However, for NMAs of RCTs, the ke y issue is not whether the included studies have different distributions of patient characteristics , but whether they have different distributions of effect modifiers . Briefly, a patient characteristic such as having received many previous lines of treatment may be a risk factor for OS (if for no other reas on than such patients are likely to be older), but on average risk fact ors cancel out across trial arms in an RCT. Risk factors are therefore not an issue for an NMA of well-conducted RCTs. An effect modifier , however, is a variable that is asso ciated with treatment effect. Effect modification is about stratification \u2014 i.e., that treatment effects (comparisons between treatments) are different in distinct patien t subgroups. Effect modification can be a problem for NMA because, if the included stud ies have different distributions of effect modifiers, each trial result will have a di fferent interpretation. This issue can be addressed by using random effects NMA, whic h attempts to account for heterogeneity. However, to address our clinical advisor's c oncerns, we performed a systematic review, meta-analysis, and simulation study, looking at the evidence for effect modification of HR for OS and PFS with respect to the purpor ted effect modifiers refractory status and number of lines of treatment. The result of this work is available as a preprint (34). Briefly, we found very weak evidence in su pport of the effect modification hypothesis. Even under a scenario that strongly fa vored the effect modi fication hypothesis, simulations suggest that no more than about 5% of random effects NMA estimates would differ under effect modifi cation versus no effect mo dification. With some caveats (see the preprint), we conclude that random-effects NMA can probably be used safely as in this report. For the purpose of the analys is, we consider all patients as belonging to the same population. We believe this is sensible sinc e we are not aware of convincing evidence that treatment effect differs with respect to variables such as whether patients are refractory to other treatments, or have re ceived more lines of treatment, or with respect to other variables. Ot her recent systematic reviews on the same topic have used a similar approach (12, 13, 17, 35). We also note that it is common practice in randomized trials of myeloma treatments to include patients who are refractory to different types of medication, and in many case s, not to report results stratified by the purported effect modifiers, as should be done if it is found that treatment effect differs by patient subgroup. In addition to the above, we also performe d prespecified analyses for each outcome (except QoL, as explained below), as follows, to assess the appropriateness of the transitivity assumption that underpins NMA. We inspected plots of the distributions of st udy and baseline characteristics (potential treatment effect modifiers) among the included studies. Where possible, we then performed statistical testing of null hypotheses that ea ch characteristic is not associated with treatment comparison. Such an associations would threaten the NMA if the variable is an effect modifier (or, mo re specifically, if th e magnitude of effect modification is sufficiently large). Where possible, we studied the following study and baseline patient characteristics: 1. Study setting (e.g., North America, Europe, multinational) 2. Funding source (industry or non-industry) 3. Average patient age 4. Percentage of patients who were female 5. Percentage of patients who were Caucasian 6. Average number of previous lines of therapy 7. Average time since diagnosis 39 Clinical efficacy and safety 8. Percentage of patients refactory to immunomodulatory drugs. (There was insufficient data to perform these analyses at the level of specific drugs, or to perform similar analyses for proteasome inhibitors.) 9. Average performance status 10. Average disease stage Due to insufficient data, we could not perform the planned analyses for the quality-of- life outcome, nor could we analyze data on diagnosis at baseline or average number of relapses for any of the outcomes. While we studied many possible effect modi fiers, effect modification was not clearly demonstrated in any of the stratified analyses in the original trial publications. It is possible that effect modification is not being reported, but assuming this is not the case, we are not overly concerned about the transitivity assumption. Assessment of inconsistency If, despite our efforts to identify threats to the transitivity assumption described above, the transitivity assumption does not hold, or if there are other threats to the assumptions underpinning NMA, inconsistency may be observed between estimates from direct comparisons (i.e., results of th e individual RCTs) and NMA estimates. We performed prespecified analyses to identify such inconsistency, as follows. For each outcome and possible pairwise comparison, we statistically compared pairwise meta- analytical estimates (representing direct evidence from the included RCTs) to NMA estimates (representing all available eviden ce) and to indirect NMA estimates. An indirect NMA estimate for a particular compar ison is obtained by omitting all studies that make the comparison from a NMA on the remaining studies. Discrepancies between these estimates indicate possible inconsistency in the network of evidence. We were unable to perform other planned anal yses of inconsistency. In particular, we could not perform loop-based analyses of inconsistency because there were no closed loops in any of the networks analyzed. Presentation of results We present estimates of relative treatment effect as point estimates (means) and 95% confidence intervals using forest plots and tables. We did not compute and so cannot present prediction intervals \u2014 i.e., intervals in which estimates from future studies are likely to fall \u2014 because this is not support ed by the software we used. Readers are therefore cautioned that future studies ma y report estimates that differ from the estimates we report and we are unable to predict what these may be. We had planned to re-express re lative treatment effect estimates in \"absolute\" terms in the summary of findings tables to aid understanding and facilitate comparisons, following Cochrane methods. For example, we planned to re-express HRs for OS as an assumed median OS time under a reference treatment and a corresponding median for the other treatments. However, an earlier dr aft of this report was criticized by our clinical advisor, who misunderstood this presentation. Our planned presentation assumed a single reference po pulation, rather than different references corresponding to patients who have been treated with and are refractory to specific treatments. To prevent misunderstanding and to avoid having to present re-expressed results for multiple populations, which would make a co mplex report even harder to read, we chose not to re-express trea tment effect estimates. We used P-scores (36) to quantify the ex tent of evidence that each treatment is superior to all other treatments with respec t to a given outcome and used these values to rank the treatments. Because RRMM patien ts may be refractory to one or more treatments, we present P-scores for four po pulations: non-refractory lenali domide and bortezomib. However, these are only a small number of the possible combinations of refractory status; it is not feasible to study and present all combinations. We caution against using these rankings in 40 Clinical efficacy and safety isolation. We also made radar plots to show P-scores (i.e., treatment rankings) for all included outcomes and treatmen ts, allowing the relative ad vantages and disadvantages of the treatments, as characterized by our meta-analyses, to be visualized simultaneously. However, note that the radar plots do not incorporate our GRADE assessments of certainty of eviden ce or an economic assessment. Figure 1 illustrates how treatment ef fect estimates can be obtained for patients who are refractory to specific treatments, and ho w we computed P-scores for the various populations. The left-most panel shows hypoth etical point estimates of HRs for an NMA of four hypothetical treatments (named A, B, C, and D). Because each trial provides a treatment effect estimate that is condit ional on patients not being refractory at randomization to the treatments studied \u2014 otherwise the trial would presumably have been deemed unethical and could not have been conducted \u2014 the NMA estimates also have this interpretation. The center panel shows that all estimates in volving treatment A are invalid for patients who are refractory to A. Assumi ng that being refractory to A is not a treatment modifier for the other comparisons (e.g., treatment A is in a different class to the other treatments, or has a sufficiently different mechanism of action), the estimates that involve A can be discarded and the remaining estimates used as is. These remaining estimates can be used to compute P-scores fo r patients who are refractory to A. These will likely differ from the P-scores for non-re fractory patients and may differ in their rank order (see Table 12 for an example). Similarly, the right-most panel shows how estimates involving treatment B can be discarded in addition to those for A, to obta in treatment effect estimates and P-scores for patients who are refractory to treatm ents A and B (again, under the assumption that being refractory to A or B is not an effect modifier for the remaining estimates). For example, if being refractory to treatmen t A is known to be an effect modifier for treatment effects involving B (perhaps treatments A and B are in the same class or have the same mechanism of action), estimate s involving A and B can be discarded.

Sensitivity analysis \u2014 China Continuation Study After reviewing the results of the NMAs on ef fect and safety, one of our clinical experts criticized our inclusion of the China Continua tion Study (37) on the basis that the included patients, who were all Chinese, are not representative of Norwegian patients due to differences in genetics, treatment history and treatment follow up. These differences might explain the difference betw een the results for OS in this study, and the larger TOURMALINE-MM1 study (37, 38). Both were comparisons of [IR + d] and [R + d], and both meet our prespecified inclusi on criteria. Similar concerns were raised about our inclusion of the Chinese LEPUS-study ([DV + d] vs. [V + d]) (39), which also had OS results that differed from those of a larger study (40), although the difference was less marked. To address the expert's concerns, we perfor med a non-prespecified sensitivity analysis in which we repeated all NMAs but ex cluded the China Continuation Study. We summarize the results with respect to OS and PFS by showing how P-scores for the treatments change when th e China Continuation Study is excluded. We present summaries for non-refractory patients, patients refractory to lenalidomide (R), patients 41 Clinical efficacy and safety refractory to bortezomib (V), and patien ts refractory to lenalidomide (R) and bortezomib (V). Note that P- scores and treatment rankings will not change for patients refractory to lenalidomide (R ), or lenalidomide (R) and bo rtezomib (V) because [IR + d] is not an admissible treatment for such patients. GRADE: assessing the certainty of evidence The certainty of evidence for our outcomes was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approa ch in accordance with the GRADE handbook, as well as the GRADE Working Group guidance of rating estimates from NMAs (41, 42). In the GRADE approach, RCTs are as a starting point, considered to provide high quality evidence. The subsequent rating of the certainty of evidence may be reduced afte r further assessment, thereby reducing the confidence of the effect estimate (41, 42). As all th e included studies in our HTA are RCTs, our outcomes were set to start out at high certainty of evidence for each treatment regimen. The certainty was then further asse ssed with regards to the following factors: 1) study limitations (risk of bias), 2) incons istency, 3) indirectness, 4) imprecision (see below for further information), and 5) publication bias (41). We assessed certainty of evidence of a ll NMA estimates for treatment regimens relevant for Norway, for all outcomes (see How we present the findings ). In addition, we assessed the certainty of evidence for all di rect evidence, i.e., estimates that were extracted directly from the included studies, for OS and PFS. Certainty of evidence is classified as in Table 4 (43). Two researchers assessed certainty of evidence, and any disagreements were resolv ed through discussion. Assessing imprecision To assess imprecision in a fair and reproduc ible manner, we made forest plots as a visual aid to better judge the width and pl acement of the 95% confidence intervals according to our set thresholds of no effect and assumed important effect, respectively. We graded one down if the 95% confidence interval crossed the threshold of no effect (either 0 or 1 depending on the outcome), as well as either the upper or lower threshold of assumed important effect. We graded two down if the 95% confidence interval crossed the threshold of no effect, in addition to both upper and lower threshold of assumed important effect, and/ or if the 95% confidence interval was particularly large. Assessing indirect evidence We only assessed certainty of indirect evidence within the same network, not across networks, and we based our approach on th e guidance from the GRADE Working Group for rating effect estimates from NMAs (42). In brief, we first assessed all direct evidence contributing to the NMA-estimate separately . We then chose the lowest of the ratings from the direct evidence and used this to further assess imprecision for the indirect NMA-estimate, as well as intransitivity be tween the contributing studies. Based on these assessments, we set a final rating for th e total certainty evidence for the selected treatment regimens, for each outcome. Table 4: Certainty of evidence classification according to GRADE handbook and GRADEpro (41, 43) GRADE Definition High certainty We are very confident that the true effect li es close to that of the estimate of the effect. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect Moderate certainty We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially 42 Clinical efficacy and safety different. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate Low certainty Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate Very low certainty Any estimate of effect is very uncertain, and we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. Assumed important effect We chose to set thresholds for what could be considered as an important effect for patients for each outcome, as an aid in asse ssing certainty of evidence for imprecision. For survival data In consulting with clinical experts, they po inted out that interventions that lead to improvements of less than 3 months survival in OS and PFS could be defined as not clinically important. However, as we could not translate the direct HR effect estimates to assumed and corresponding survival times expressed in months, we chose to GRADE all effect estimates, i.e., both the non- NMA estimates and NMA-estimates (direct and indirect) in the same manner. We therefore set liberal thresholds of assumed important effect for both OS and PFS at HR=0.8 and HR=1.25. For quality of life For QoL, the effect estimates were expresse d as difference in QLQ-30 global health score. We performed a simple literature se arch and found a paper suggesting that an absolute change in the EORTC QLQ-C30 score of 8-12 could be considered important by patients with multiple myeloma in Norway (44). Based on this, we used the lower absolute score change of 8 (i.e., +8 and -8) as the threshold for assumed important effect. For severe adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse events A simple literature search revealed no in formation regarding assumed important effect for SAE and discontinuation due to adve rse events. As such, we assessed the importance of effects and the precision of the estimates based on how likely it seemed that patients would make different decisions if the true effect was near the lower or upper end of the 95% confidence interval. Based on this, we a ssumed it to be an important effect if the effect estimates of differences in events (i.e., SAE, and discontinuations, respectively), were below -50 or above 50. Ethical aspects Ethics was not assessed for this health technology assessment. Legal aspects Legal aspects was not assessed for th is health technology assessment. 43 Clinical efficacy and safety RESULTS Literature search and article selection The article selection is presented in Figure 2. References from systematic reviews We identified 79 references from the 13 systematic reviews (9-21) included in our previous mapping review (8). First, 41 refe rences were excluded ba sed on screening of title and abstract, and then further seven re ferences were exclude d based on full text screening. In total 31 articles were in cluded from the systematic reviews ( Table 5). References from search We identified 731 references from four sea rches performed in the period of February 2020 to January 2022. First, 661 references were excluded based on screening of title and abstract, and then further 22 refe rences were excluded based on full text screening. In total, 37 articles we re included from the searches ( Table 5). Figure 2: Flow chart of article selection. SR: systematic reviews.

In total, four articles were included from the hand search ( Table 5). Description of studies Excluded studies A full list of articles excluded through the fu ll text screening (seven from systematic reviews, and 22 from searches), with reasons for why they were excluded, is presented in Appendix 5. In brief, exclusions were mainly due to wrong study design, and wrong population, intervention, or outcome. In a ddition, several articles were also excluded when we had included other articles from the same study with longer follow-up. Included studies All included studies are briefly presented in Table 5. In total, we included 72 articles from 50 RCTs, with a total number of 28 339 participants, ranging from 15 to 465 in the different trials. All participants had multip le myeloma and had experienced at least one relapse and/or were treatment refractory to at least one previous line of treatment. The included studies are presente d in further detail in Appendix 6. Some of the included articles or studies were however omitted from the analysis, either because they compared different doses or administration me thods of the same treatment regimen, or because they did not present data in a manner that was compatible with the meta-analysis. A list of these omitted studies and ar ticles with reasons for why, is presented in Appendix 7. Ongoing studies The list detailing relevant ongo ing clinical trials is found in Appendix 8. In brief, we found 28 ongoing trials that represent 8616 planned participants and include various treatment regimens with differe nt drugs. Five of the ongoing studies have results that have been included in this HTA ( Appendix 8). 45 Clinical efficacy and safety Table 5: Included studies Study name Publication - year - (ref) Publications identified from search or SR Treatments 1703 Richardson 2015 (45) SR (19) [ER + d], n=36 [ER + d], n=37 AMBER 12, 13) [BevV], n=49 [PboV], n=53 APEX Richardson 2005 13, 17) [V], n=333 [d], n=336 Richardson 2007 (48) SR (9, 12, 13, 17) Lee 2008 (49) Hand search APOLLO Dimopoulos 2021 (50) Search + d], n=240 [K + d], n=238 Moreau 2019 (53) Search 1 ASPIRE Stewart 2015 (30) SR (9, 12, 13, 15-17, 21) [KR + d], n=396 [R n=97 n=195 [V + d], Siegel 2021 (59) Search 4 CASTOR Palumbo 2016 (60) SR (9, 12, 13, n=251 2021 (61) Mateos [D], n=263 [D], d], n=324 [V], n=322 Orlowski 2016 (65) SR (9, 12, 2018 (66) Search + d], n=154 ENDEAVOR Dimopoulos 2016 (69) SR (9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18) [K + d], n=464 [V + d], n=465 Ludwig 2019 Orlowski 2019 (71) Search 1 FOCUS H\u00e1jek 2017 (72) n=123 46 Clinical and 2019 [P + d], n=113 MM-003 San Miguel 2013 (78) SR (10, 12, 13, 17, 21) [P + d], n=302 [d], n=153 Song 2015 (79) Hand search Weisel 2015 (80) Hand search MM-009 Weber 2007 (81) SR (9, 12, 13, 17) d], n=177 [Pbo + d], n=176 Nordic Myeloma Study Hjorth 2012 + d], n=67 [V + d], n=281; [V + d], n=278 Weisel 2020 (86) Search 2 PANORAMA-1 San Miguel 2014 (87) SR (9, 11-13, + d], n=387 [V Miguel 2016 (88) SR (9, 11-13, 16-18, 20) Richardson 2018 (89) 2018 PANORAMA-3 n=83 POLLUX Dimopoulos (91) 13, [DR + d], n=281 [R 2021 (93) Search 4 SIRIUS Lonial 2016 + mp], n=106 + mp], n=18 The China Continuation Study (37) SR d], n=58 TOURMALINE-MM1 + d], n=360 [R + d], n=465 Leleu 2021 (38) Search 4 VANTAGE-088 Dimopoulos 2021 (96) SR 13, 17, 20) n=317 [V], n=320 + d], n=57 + d], n=22 Jakubowiak 12, 18, 19) [EV + d], n=77 47 Clinical efficacy and safety d], [V + d], n=74 studies that could not be used in the statistical analysis.

Risk of bias in included studies For 22 of our included RCTs we used the risk of bias assessment ma de by Maiese et al (13) ( Table 6, Figure 3, Figure 5A).

As such, we considered studies with no or unclear blin ding of the personnel who carried out the outcome assessment to have low risk of bias, as we were confident this would likely not have any effect on OS. We were unsure if OS may be affected by blinding of participants and the personnel involved in the treatment of the patients. We therefore assessed the risk of bias as uncertain when there was no blinding, or the degree of blinding was unclear. However, wh en assessing an overall risk of bias for each of these studies, we gave little weight to our initial assessment of this domain. When used in GRADEing certainty of evidence, we assesse d the overall risk of bias specifically for each outcome. Thus, overall risk of bias assessment for one study could differ between outcomes. 49 Clinical efficacy and safety Figure 3: Risk of bias graphs across included studies .

We suggest readers familiarize th emselves with this chapter before trying to read the results. While only some of the treatments reported on were pre-specified and listed in our protocol, we also included treatments used as comparators (which are necessary for obtaining treatment effect estimates and hence performing a NMA), and therefore present results for all treatments included in the meta-analysis. We present results of treatment regimens that are re levant for Norway, i.e., listed as first, second or third treatment choice in the Norwegian guideline for treatment of multiple myeloma (3). Results for all treatments from all of the included studies, are presented in Appendix 10. The calculation and interpretation of a relative treatment effect such as HR necessitates a reference treatment. In a NMA, all treatments are comparators and any one of them can be used as a reference without affecting the underlying estimates. For each outcome, we present: A figure that presents the topology of the evidence network resulting from the included studies. In all cases evidence networks were disconnected. Readers are directed to the Method chapter for an explanation of how we addressed this issue. A matrix of all possible pairs of relative treatment effect estimate provided by the NMA, for treatments relevant in Norway, as well as our assessment of the certainty of the evidence for each comparison. Whil e \"statistically significant\" results are highlighted, this simply means that there is insufficient evidence to precisely estimate the relative effect s of other pairs of treatments, and does not preclude superiority of some treatments over othe rs being demonstrated in future studies A summary of findings table ranked by P-score for non-refractory patients, along with P-scores for three other populations (see Methods), for treatment regimens relevant for Norway. A P-score can be inte rpreted as the probability that a given treatment is superior, with respect to the outcome, to all other treatments, accounting for the modeled uncertainty of the relative treatment effects. P-scores are not P-values. P-scores are not anticipated to sum to 100%. A forest plot of the direct treatment effect estimates (HRs with 95% CIs) published in the included studies for the two routinel y-studied efficacy outcomes OS and PFS. (Direct treatment effect estimates, includin g statements of precision, were often not published for the other outcomes.) Furthermore, in Appendix 10, we present additional results for each outcome: A figure that shows the treatments, studies, designs, and sample sizes that could be included in the meta-analysis. A forest plot showing the extracted or imputed data and the corresponding estimates provided by meta-analysis. A matrix of all possible pairs of relative treatment effect estimate provided by the NMA, for all treatments of the included studies A summary of findings table ranked by P-score for non-refractory patients, along with P-scores for three other populations (see Methods), for all included treatment regimens. A P-score can be interpreted as the probability that a given treatment is superior, with respect to the outcome, to all other treatments, accounting for the modeled uncertainty of the re lative treatment effects. P- scores are not P-values. P- scores are not anticipated to sum to 100%. Finally, we summarize all included treatments with respect to all outcomes studied by presenting radar plots of P-scores. Howeve r, readers are discouraged from drawing 52 Clinical efficacy and safety conclusions based on these plots alone but should consider all available evidence. While it may be tempting to favor treatments with \"larger\" polyg ons in these figures, note that some outcomes are missing for some treatments, which can distort the size of the polygons and lead to potentially erroneous conclusions. Certainty of evidence We evaluated the certainty of the estimate s of the primary outcomes using the GRADE- NMA approach. Readers are referred to the Method chapter for more information on how this was done ( GRADE: assessing the certainty of evidence ). Our GRADE judgements are presented in the matrix plots for all outcomes, as well as in Appendix 9. 53 Clinical efficacy and safety Results - Overall survival Direct evidence Evidence extracted directly from the inclu ded studies of HRs with 95% confidence intervals for OS for treatment regimens relevant for Norway, was set into a forest plot, along with assessments of certainty of evid ence (GRADE), and study name (Figure 6: Forest plot of direct ev idence - overall survival Figure 6). Within the forest plot, the direct evidence is organized after the common treatments (i.e., treatment B), such as [K + d], [P + d], etc. Details of our assessment of GRADE is presented in Appendix 9 Detailed GRADE: overall survivalDirect estimates . Figure 6: Forest plot of direct evidence overall survival * 95,4% confidence interval. Only shown treatment regimens that are relevant for Norway. CI: confidence treatment B. 54 Clinical efficacy and safety NMA results The NMA of OS resulted in three disconnected networks ( Figure 7) with a total of 31 treatment regimens. An NMA was performed using data on the 31 treatment regimens from 31 RCTs that enrolled a total of 12 279 patients ( Appendix 10 Additional results: overall survival ). We used random effects component NMA to estimate average HRs to account for between-study heterogeneity. An average tr eatment effect estimate should not be misinterpreted as being equivalent to an estimate from a single study (which cannot account for between-study heterogeneity). Consequently, confidence intervals on average treatment effect estimates may be wider that those arising from individual studies. The matrix plot ( Table 7) presents estimates of HRs and 95% confidence intervals, in addition to ou r assessment of the certainty of evidence, for treatment regimens relevant for Norway. Heterogeneity ( I 2) was estimated to be 74.9% (95% CI 43.1% to 88.9%). The Fant ikke referansekilden. ) presents treatment for Norway rank ed by P-score for non-refractory patients along with assessments of certainty of evid ence (GRADE). It also presents ranked treatments for patients who are refractory to lenalidomide and/or bortezomib.

A lower rank should not be interpreted to mean that a treatment is definitively worse than a higherranked treatment. Only listed treatment regimens relevant for Norway. Ranks are calculated for all treatments included in the NMA (i.e., ranks may not begin at 1 and ranks for treatments not relevant to Norway are not shown). NOTE: We have limited confidence in the specific order in which these treatments are ranked, and therefore caution against using this ranking uncritically. Among treatment regimens relevant for Norw ay, the three highest ranked treatments for non-refractory patients for OS are [DR + d], [IR + d] and [DV + d]. The estimated probabilities that these are the best of a ll analysed treatment regimens, are 86%, 85% and 79%, respectively ( Table 8). For patients who are refractory to le nalidomide (R) (i.e., not responding to lenalidomide), the three highest ranked relevant treatment regimens are [DV + d], [EP + d] and [IsP + d]. The estimated probabilities that these are the best of all analysed treatment regimens, are 78%, 75% and 72%, respectively ( 8). For patients who are refractory to bortezom ib (V) (i.e., not responding to bortezomib), the three highest ranked relevant treatment regimens are [DR + d], [IR + d] and [KR + d]. The estimated probabilities that these are the best of all analysed treatment regimens, are 84%, 83% and 75%, respectively ( Table 8). For patients who are refractory to both le nalidomide (R) and bortezomib (V) (i.e., not responding to either lenalidomide or bortez omib), the three highest ranked relevant treatment are + d], [IsP + d] and [DK + d]. The estimated probabilities that these are the best of all analysed treatment regimens, are 77%, 74% and 71%, respectively ( Table 8). The matrix plot ( Table 7) presents the NMA effect estimates for OS, for all possible comparisons between the treatment regimens relevant to Norway. As shown for OS, none of the 105 NMA effect estimate s were statistically significant ( Table 7). 58 Clinical efficacy and safety Judgements about the ranking of the variou s treatment regimens should not be made without also taking the certainty of the evid ence into consideration. We were not able to assess the certainty of evidence for 54 of 105 of the comp arisons between the relevant treatment regimens, because the GR ADE method has not yet been extended to address disconnected networks ( Figure 7). Of the 51 comparisons we could assess however, the majority was set as very low, mostly due to very wide 95% confidence intervals ( Table 7). Details of our assessment of GRADE is presented in Appendix 9 Detailed GRADE: overall survival . As such, for OS we cannot confidently say that one treatment regimen is better than another. In assessing the results of OS, it would be reasonable, if possible, to put more weight on the direct estimates from the individual studies, rather than on the NMA results. Even though our results show that the treatment regimens [IR + d] and [DV + d] are ranked second and third highest for patients that are non-refractory to any drug with 85% and 79% probability of being the best, re spectively, we have very low confidence in all their effect estimates ( Table 7, Appendix 9 Detailed GRADE: overall survival ). The NMA effect estimate of the treatment regime n [IR + d] (compared with [R + d]), is based on two studies: one large intern ational study (TOURMALINE-MM1) which showed little or no difference on OS between the two groups, and one very small regional (Chinese) study, which showed that the intervention group had a substantial improvement of OS (37, 38). As shown in Figure 6, the 95% confidence intervals of these two studies do not overlap. There ar e several factors that could explain this discrepancy, including genetic differen ces between the study populations, and differences in the follow up treatments after progression. This, in addition to inconsistent results in the two studies, an d the wide 95% confiden ce interval in the direct NMA effect estimate, caused us to ra te down the certainty of evidence to very low ( Appendix 9 Detailed GRADE: overall survival ). Similarly, the NMA effect estimate of the treatment regimen [DV + d] (compared with [V + d]), is also based on two studies: one large international study (CASTOR), and a smaller study conducted exclusively in Ch ina (LEPUS) (39, 60). The smaller LEPUS study showed a point estimate that indica ted better effect on OS than the larger CASTOR study ( Figure 6). Contrary to [IR + d] though, effe estimates of [DV + d] vs were more consistent as the 95% confid ence intervals overlap, suggesting that [DV + d] treatment in the two studies may have similar effect on OS ( Figure 6). Similar to [IR + d], the effect discrepancies for [DV + d] in the LEPUS and CASTOR studies may be caused by several factors, including differ ences (genetic and others) between the study populations, as well as potential differenc es in the follow-up treatments after progression. Based on this, we rated down the certainty of evidence to very low (Appendix 9 Detailed GRADE: overall survival ). Transitivity analysis for overall survival In analyses performed to assess the transi tivity assumption we found statistically significant (P<0.05) associations between treatment comparison and the following study and baseline patient characteristics: study setting, funding source, number of previous treatment lines, and the percentage of patients with stage I and III disease. However, there is substantial variab ility across all va riables studied. We judge that associations with study se tting and funding source are unlikely to threaten the transitivity assumption. These associations are \"significant\" because there are a small number of specific treatment comparisons that were either not multinational studies or that were not in dustry-funded. I.e., while the p-value is significant, there is almost no variati on with respect to treatment comparison. Due to lack of data, it was not possible to perform these analyses for the percentage of patients who were Caucasian, who were re fractory to immunomodulatory drugs, or had performance status 3. We do not have strong evid ence that transitivity may be threatened with respect to these characteristics, but it is possible. 59 Clinical efficacy and safety Of the characteristics studied, there is only convincing evidence of potentially important associations with respect to nu mber of previous lines of treatment and disease stage, and these could in principle threaten transitivity. Our systematic review, meta-analysis, and simulation study (34) di d not identify that these variables are important effect modifiers, though some un certainty remains, and we did not find any evidence of inconsistency between direct, indirect, and NMA estimates. We therefore conclude that any violations of the assumptions underpinning the NMA do not manifest as detectable inconsistency and the estima tes are probably trustworthy. Ideally, we would have also used loop-based methods to assess inconsistency, but this was not possible because there were no closed loops. Sensitivity analysis \u2014 China Continuation Study Figure 8 shows how P-scores differ when the China Continuation Study is removed from the NMA for OS. For non-refractory patien ts, the P-score for [IR + d] 0.85 to 0.73. For patients who are refractory to V, the P-score for [IR + d] changes from 0.83 to 0.69. These differences result in a mark ed drop in rankings for [IR + d]; this is addressed further in Discussion . 60 Clinical efficacy and safety Figure 8: Sensitivity analysis results showing the effect of removing the China Continuation Study on Pscores for overall survival efficacy and safety Results - Quality of life NMA results The NMA of QoL resulted in three disconnected networks ( Figure 9) with a total of 12 treatment regimens. A NMA was performed usin g data on the 12 treatments from nine RCTs that enrolled a total of 5063 patients ( Appendix 10 Additional results: quality of life). We used random effects component NMA to estimate average difference in mean QLQ- C30 Global Health Status score and account for between-study heterogeneity. A positive difference indicates higher (better) QoL relative to a comparator. The variance component modelling heterogeneity, and hence I 2, could not be estimated, so the resulting model may misestimat e the degree of uncertainty that would exist if this could have been estimated. The matrix plot ( Table 9) presents estimates of average differences and 95% confidence intervals, in addition to our assessment of the certainty of evidence, for treatment regimens relevant for Norway. The summary of findings table ( Table 10) presents treatment regimens relevant for Norway ranked by P-score fo r non-refractory patients, along with assessments of certainty of evidence (GRADE). It also presents ranked treatments for patients who are refractory to lenalidomide and/or bortezomib.

Among treatment regimens relevant for Norw ay, the three highest ranked treatments for non-refractory patients for QoL are [KR + d], [K + d] and [DK + d]. The estimated probabilities that these are the best of a ll analysed treatment regimens, are 86%, 73% and 72%, respectively ( Table 10). For patients who are refractory to le nalidomide (R) (i.e., not responding to lenalidomide), the three highest ranked relevant treatment regimens are [K + d], [DK + d] and [IsP + d]. The estimated probabilities that these are the best of all analysed treatment regimens, are 71%, 71% and 64%, respectively ( Table 10).

The estimated probabilities that these are the best of all analysed treatment regimens, are 81%, 66% and 66%, respectively ( Table 10).

The matrix plot ( Table 9) presents the NMA effect estimates for QoL, for all possible comparisons between the treatment regimens re levant to Norway. For QoL, only five of 55 NMA effect estimates were statistically significant ( Table 9): [K + d] vs. [R + d] indirect across networks [K + d] vs. [V + d] - direct comparison [KR + d] vs. [R + d] - direct comparison 64 Clinical efficacy and safety [KR + d] vs. [V + d] - indirect comparison across networks [DK + d] vs. [V + d] - indirect comparison within the same network Judgements about the ranking of the variou s treatment regimens should not be made without also taking the certainty of the evid ence into consideration. We were not able to assess the certainty of evidence for 38 of 55 of the comparisons between the relevant treatment regimens, because the GRADE meth od has not yet been extended address disconnected networks ( Figure 9). However, the 17 NMA effe ct estimates that we could assess, were set between high an d low certainty of evidence ( Table 9). For the five significant NMA estimates, we could only assess certainty of evidence for three ( Table 9): [K + d] vs. [V + evidence [DK + d] vs. [V + d]: high certainty [KR + d] vs. [R + d]: modera te certainty of evidence Details of our assessment of GRADE is presented in Appendix - Detailed GRADE: quality of life. Transitivity analysis for quality of life We were unable to perform the planned analyses of study and baseline patient characteristics, or the analysis of inco nsistency between the direct, indirect, and network evidence, for this outcome due to insufficient data. We therefore rely on a conceptual evaluation of the validity of the transitivity assumption. 65 Clinical efficacy and safety Results - Severe adverse events NMA results The NMA of SAE resulted in three disconnected networks ( Figure 10) with a total of 30 treatment regimens. A NMA was performed usin g data on the 30 treatments from 31 RCTs that enrolled a total of 12 124 patients ( Appendix 10 Additional results: severe adverse events ). We used random effects component NMA to estimate average incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and account for between-study heterogeneity. An average treatment effect estimate should not be misinterpreted as being equivalent to an estimate from a single study (which cannot account for between -study heterogeneity). Consequently, confidence intervals on average treatment ef fect estimates may be wider that those arising from individual st udies. The matrix plot ( Table 11) presents estimates of IRRs and 95% confidence intervals, in additi on to our assessment of the certainty of evidence, for treatment regimens relevant for Norway. Heterogeneity ( I 2) was estimated to be 4.3% (95% CI 0% to 72.1%). The summary of findings table ( Table 12) presents treatment regimens relevant for Norway ranked by P-score fo r non-refractory patients, along with assessments of certainty of evidence (GRADE). It also presents ranked treatments for patients who are refractory to lenalidomide and/or bortezomib.

A lower rank should not be interpreted to mean that a treatment is definitively worse than a higherranked treatment. Only listed treatment regimens relevant for Norway. Ranks are calculated for all treatments included in the NMA (i.e., ranks may not begin at 1 and ranks for treatments not relevant to Norway are not shown). NOTE: We have limited confidence in the specific order in which these treatments are ranked, and therefore caution against using this ranking uncritically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the treatment regime ns ranked highest in terms of OS, were ranked lowest for SAE, and vice versa. That is to say the more \"aggressive\" treatments appear to be associated with higher rates of SAEs. Among treatment regimens relevant for Norw ay, the three highest ranked treatments for non-refractory patients for SAE are [P + d], [V + d] and [K + d]. The estimated probabilities that these are the best of a ll analysed treatment regimens, are 69%, 62% and 62%, respectively ( Table 12). These treatment regimens were among the lowest ranked treatment regimens in terms of OS. For patients who are refractory to le nalidomide (R) (i.e., not responding to lenalidomide), the three highest ranked relevant treatment regimens are [P + d], [V + d] and [K + d]. The estimated probabilities that these are the best of all analysed treatment regimens are 62%, 53% and 53%, respectively ( Table 12). For patients who are refractory to bo rtezomib (V) (i.e., not responding to lenalidomide), the three highest ranked relevant treatment regimens are [P + d], [EP + d] and [K + d]. The estimated probabilities that these are the best of all analysed treatment regimens, are 61%, 55% and 54%, respectively ( Table 12). For patients who are refractory to both le nalidomide (R) and bortezomib (V) (i.e., not responding to either lenalidomide or bortez omib), the three highest ranked relevant treatment regimens are [P + d], [EP + d] an d [K + d]. The estimated probabilities that 69 Clinical efficacy and safety these are the best of all analysed tr eatment regimens, are 43%, 37% and 33%, respectively ( Table 12). The matrix plot ( Table 11) presents the NMA effect estimates for SAE, for all possible comparisons between the treatment regimens relevant to Norway. For SAE, only 18 of 105 NMA effect estimates were statistically significant ( Table 11). Judgements about the ranking of the variou s treatment regimens should not be made without also taking the certainty of the evid ence into consideration. We were not able to assess the certainty of evidence for 54 of 105 of the comp arisons between the relevant treatment regimens, because the GRADE method has not yet been extended address disconnected networks ( Figure 10). However, the 51 NMA effect estimates that we could assess, were set between high and very low certainty of evidence, with the majority set as low or very low ( Table 11). Of the 18 significant NMA estimates, we could only assess certainty of evidence for ni ne NMA estimates, in which one were set as high, six were set as low, and two were set as very low ( Table 11). Details of our assessment of GRADE is presented in Appendix 9 Detailed GRADE: severe adverse events. Transitivity analysis for severe adverse events Results of analyses performed to assess th e transitivity assumption were consistent with those for OS. 70 Clinical efficacy and safety Results - Progression free survival Direct evidence Evidence extracted directly from the inclu ded studies of HRs with 95% confidence intervals for PFS for treatmen t regimens relevant for Norw ay, ,was set into a forest plot, along with assessments of certainty of evidence (GRADE), and study name ( Figure 11). Within the forest plot, the direct evidence is organized after the common treatments (i.e., treatment B), such as [K + d], [P + d], etc. Figure 11: Forest plot of direct evidence - progression free survival * 95,4% confidence interval. Only shown treatment regimens that are relevant for Norway. CI: confidence treatment B 71 Clinical efficacy and safety NMA results The NMA of PFS resulted in five disconnected networks ( Figure 12) with a total of 35 treatment regimens. A NMA was performed usin g data on the 35 treatments from 32 RCTs that enrolled a total of 11 936 patients ( Appendix 10 Additional results: progression free survival ). We used random effects component NMA to estimate average HRs and account for between-study heterogeneity. The variance component was estimated to be zero, so the resulting model is equivalent to a fixed (common) effects model and may underestimate the degree of uncertainty that would exist if more studies could have been included. The matrix plot ( Table 13) presents estimates of HRs and 95% confidence intervals, in addition to our a ssessment of the certainty of evidence, for treatment regimens relevant for Norway. Heterogeneity ( I2) was estimated to be 0% (95% CI 0% to 36.7%). The summary of findings table ( Table 14) presents treatment regimens relevant for Norway ranked by P-score fo r non-refractory patients, along with assessments of certainty of evidence (GRADE). It also presents ranked treatments for patients who are refractory to lenalidomide and/or bortezomib.

Among treatment regimens relevant for Norw ay, the three highest ranked treatments for PFS are [EP + d], [IsP + d] and [IsK d], patients are refractory to lenalidomide (R ), bortezomib (V), or both . The estimated probabilities that these are the best of all analysed treatment regimens, are as follows patients: 96% and For patients who are refractory to le nalidomide (R) (i.e., not responding to lenalidomide): 96%, 95% and 87%, respectively For patients who are refractory to bo rtezomib (V) (i.e., not responding to bortezomib): 96%, 93% and 83%, respectively For patients who are refractory to both lenalidomide (R) and bortezomib (V) (i.e., not responding to either lenalido mide or bortezomib): 93%, 90% and 75%, respectively The matrix plot ( Table 13Table 11) presents the NMA effect estimates for PFS, for all possible comparisons between the treatment re gimens relevant to Norway. For PFS, 74 of 120 NMA effect estimates we re statistically significant ( Table 13). Judgements about the ranking of the variou s treatment regimens should not be made without also taking the certainty of the evid ence into consideration. We were not able to assess the certainty of evidence for 85 of 105 of the comp arisons between the relevant treatment regimens, because the GR ADE method has not yet been extended to 75 Clinical efficacy and safety address disconnected networks ( Figure 12). However, the 35 NMA effect estimates that we could assess, were set between high and very low certainty of evidence ( Table 13). Of the 74 significant NMA estimates, we coul d only assess certainty of evidence for 23 NMA estimates, in which 16 were set as high , one was set as modera te, and six were set as low certainty of evidence ( Table 13). Details of our a ssessment of GRADE is presented in Appendix 9 Detailed GRADE: progression free survival. Transitivity analysis for progression free survival Results of analyses performed to assess th e transitivity assumption were consistent with those for OS. There is no evidence of inconsistency between direct, indirect, and NMA estimates. Sensitivity analysis \u2014 China Continuation Study Figure 13 shows how P-scores differ when the China Continuation Study is removed from the NMA for PFS. For non-refractory pa tients, the P-score for [IR + d] changes from 0.47 to 0.44. For patients who are refrac tory to V, the P-score for [IR + d] changes from 0.33 to 0.30. These differences change the rankings for [IR + d] and [ER + d], but the P-scores are so similar for these two trea tments in the full and sensitivity analyses that it would be unwise to conclude that one of the treatments is definitively better than the other with respect to PFS. 76 Clinical efficacy and safety Figure 13: Sensitivity analysis results showing the effect of removing the China Continuation Study on Pscores for progression free survival efficacy and safety Results - Discontinuation due to adverse events NMA results The NMA of discontinuation due to adverse events resulted in three disconnected networks ( Figure 14) with a total of 35 treatmen t regimens. A NMA was performed using data on the 35 treatments from 34 RCTs that enrolled a total of 12 873 patients (Appendix 10 Additional results: discontinuation due to adverse events ). We used random effects component NMA to estimate average risk ratios (RRs) and account for between-study heterogeneity. An average treatment effect estimate should not be misinterpreted as being equivalent to an estimate from a single study (which cannot account for between-study heterogene ity). Consequently, confidence intervals on average treatment effect estimates may be wider that those arising from individual studies. The matrix plot ( Table 15) presents estimates of HRs and 95% confidence intervals, in addition to ou r assessment of the certainty of evidence, for treatment regimens relevant for Norway. Heterogeneity ( I2) was estimated to be 31.1% (95% CI 0% to 73.6%). The summary of findings table ( Table 16) presents treatment regimens relevant for Norway ranked by P-score fo r non-refractory patients, along with assessments of certainty of evidence (GRADE).

A lower rank should not be interpreted to mean that a treatment is definitively worse than a higherranked treatment. Only listed treatment regimens relevant for Norway. Ranks are calculated for all treatments included in the NMA (i.e., ranks may not begin at 1 and ranks for treatments not relevant to Norway are not shown). NOTE: We have limited confidence in the specific order in which these treatments are ranked, and therefore caution against using this ranking uncritically. Among treatment regimens relevant for Norw ay, the three highest ranked treatments for patients who are non-refractory, as well as patients who are refractory to lenalidomide (R) (i.e., not responding to lena lidomide), in terms of discontinuation due to adverse events are [IsP + d], [IsK + d] and [PV + d]. The estimated probabilities that these are the best of all analysed treatment regimens, are as follows ( Table 16): For patients who are either refractory to bortezomib (V) (i.e., not responding to bortezomib) or refractory to both lenali domide (R) and bortezomib (V) (i.e., not responding to either lenalidomide or bortez omib), the three highest ranked relevant treatment are + d], [IsK + d] and [P + d]. The estimated probabilities that these are the best of all analysed treatment regimens, are as follows ( bortezomib and 56%, respectively The matrix plot ( Table 15) presents the NMA effect estimates for discontinuation due to adverse events, for all possibl e comparisons between the treatment regimens relevant 81 Clinical efficacy and safety to Norway. For discontinuation due to adverse events, only 13 of 120 NMA effect estimates were statistically significant ( Table 15). Judgements about the ranking of the variou s treatment regimens should not be made without also taking the certainty of the evid ence into consideration. We were not able to assess the certainty of evidence for 63 of 105 of the comp arisons between the relevant treatment regimens, because the GRADE method has not yet been extended address disconnected networks ( Figure 14). However, the 57 NMA effect estimates that we could assess, were set between high and very low certainty of evidence, with the majority being very low ( Table 13). Of the 13 significant NMA estimates, we could only assess certainty of evidence for eight NMA estimates, in which three were set as high, two were set as low, and three were se t as very low certainty of evidence ( Table 15). Details of our assessment of GRADE is presented in Appendix 9 Detailed GRADE: discontinuation due to adverse events . Transitivity analysis for discontinuation due to adverse events Analyses performed to assess the transitivi ty assumption were consistent with those for OS. There is no evidence of inconsis tency between direct, indirect, and NMA estimates. 82 Clinical efficacy and safety Radar plots of Pscores for all included treatments and outcomes All NMAs are summarized in sets of radar plots of P-scores: Figure 15 for non- refractory patients, Figure 16 for patients who are refrac tory to lenalidomide (R), Figure 17 for patients who are refracto ry to bortezomib (V), and Figure 18 for patients who are refractory to both lenalidomide (R) and bortezomib (V). Each radar plot shows the available P-scores for a given treatment as a polygon (shaded). A P-score quantifies the extent of evidence that a given treatment is superior to all other included treatments with respect to a given outcome, and accounts for uncertainty. We would expect on average that patients given a trea tment with a P-score for OS closer to 100% would survive longer, and that patients give n a treatment with a P-score for SAE closer to 100% would experience fe wer SAEs. In general, treatm ents with polygons with larger areas are likely superior to those wi th smaller areas. P-sc ores are not expected to sum to 100%. The radar plots do not incorporate our GRADE assessments of the certainty of the evidence or economic analysis. Comparing the overall efficacy and safety of the various treatment regimens across outcomes is challenging, as not all treatmen t regimens have data (and therefore no P- score) on all outcomes. When comparing results between treatment regimens, one should be careful not to interpret effect so lely based on polygon area. Radar plots of the double combination [P + d] exemplify trea tment regimens that have a large polygon area. This would indicate better efficacy and safety than treatment regimens with smaller polygons, e.g., [ER + d]. However, wh en looking more closely at the individual P-scores, we find that [P + d] has lower P-score for OS than [ER + d], and we would expect longer survival by trea tment with [ER + d] than with [P + d]. As such, although radar plots may be useful for understanding tradeoffs betwee n efficacy and safety, they should not be interpreted in isolation. In addition, the radar plots do not reflect assessments of the certainty of evidence or results of the health economic analysis. As shown in Figure 15, the six triplet combinations [EP + trea tment relevant for non-refractory patients that have clearly favo rable HRs for OS, that also ra nked highly with respect to other outcomes. As shown in Figure 16, Figure 17, and Figure 18, the three triplet combinations [DK + d], [EP + d] and [IsP + d] are examples of treatment regimens that have clearly favorable HRs for OS, and also ranked highly with respect to other outcomes, and that are relevant for patients who are refractory to lenalidomide (R), bortezomib (V), and lenalidomide (R) and bortez omib (V), respectively. Remember that P-scores, and hence the shapes of the polygons, would be different for patients who are refractory to specific trea tments: it is not possible to simply ignore polygons for treatments that are not comp etitors on the basis of refractoriness and assume that the shapes of the remaining polygons would be unchanged. 83 Clinical efficacy and safety Figure 15: Radar plot of treatment regimens relevant for nonrefractory patients Radar plots show treatment regimens relevant to Norwegian clinical practice.

Literature Search Over the course of the project, we perfor med three simple literature searches (May 2020, May 2021, and March 2022) in PubMed for cost-effectiveness analyses of treatments for relapsed and/or refrac tory multiple myeloma using the terms \"myeloma\" and \"cost-effectiven ess\". Unlike searches for clinical effect and safety results, a search for cost-effectiveness analys es is not intended to identify studies that could be used directly to determine the cost -effectiveness in Norway of treatments for relapsed and/or refractory multiple myelom a. Health systems can vary widely across countries in terms of organizational structur e and costs, making it impossible to apply published results of a cost-effectiveness analysis conducted in one country to a different country. 8 Instead, the goal of the search is to find relevant cost-effectiveness analyses to help inform our choices about what type of economic model to use and alternative ways to structure the model; as potential sources for utility weights needed to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (Q ALYs); and to identify strengths and of weaknesses of our results by comparing them with results in other studies. The searches returned three systematic reviews\u2014Aguiar 2016 (110), Asra 2021 (111) and Seefat 2022 (112), which included 8, 17 , and 13 articles, respectively\u2014and a total of 61 individual articles. After discardi ng duplicates, we examined the remaining articles and excluded those that focused on treatments for newly diagnosed patients rather than relapsed and/or refractory pati ents, those that did not present results in terms of costs per QALYs or only presented a budget impact analysis, and those that provided incomplete or limited informatio n about methods, e.g., letters, abstracts, reviews. In total we included fourteen relevant cost-effectiveness analyses. 9 Information about the treatments examined, the type of analysis conducted, utility weights used for calculating QALYs, and the cost-effectiveness results from each included analysis, is provided in Appendix 12. 8 Although it is sometimes possible to obtain permission to apply Norwegian data to an existing economic model, none of the models we examined were suitable. 9 We did not include \"grey literature\", e.g., single technology assessments performed in other countries because confidential pricing agreements in individu al countries resulted in either \"empty\" or highly redacted cost-effectiveness analyses by sources such as NICE or CADTH. 88 Health economic evaluation Three different types of cost-effectiveness mode ls were used in the included studies: 1) four studies (113-116) perfor med discrete event simulation s, made possible by access to patient level data from trials with a sing le intervention and a relevant comparator, 2) four studies, also with access to patient leve l data, used either a Markov (117-119) or a semi-Markov model (120), 3) the remaining ten studies performed partitioned survival analyses. Nine of the cost-effectiveness analyses ex amined a single inte rvention (comprising either two or three medications) with a si ngle comparator (113-117, 121-124). Four analyses compared either several interventi ons with a single comparator or a single intervention with different comparators (118-120, 125). The largest number of treatments compared in a single analysis examined the cost-effectiveness of six potential \"triplet\" treatments relative to one of two standard comparators used as either second or third-line treatments (126). Health economic model Model Basics We used TreeAge (127) to perform a cost-utili ty analysis of 13 treatments for relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma patients in which relevant cost s were expressed in 2022 Norwegian kroner (NOK)10 and effects were expresse d in QALYs. The analysis was performed from an extended health sect or perspective, which includes all direct reatment costs and the time and travel costs for patients during treatment. Both costs and effects were discounted at an annual rate of 4%, in accordance with Norwegian guidelines for health economic analyses (128). We assumed a starting age for treatment of 65 years, based on the mean age of patients included in trials used for the NMA, and a 20-year time horizon for the mo del. An important characteristic of our analysis is that we are only able to determine the cost-effectiveness of each treatment compared to other treatments without an y consideration of treatment sequencing, beyond the assumption that all patients have a relapsed and/or refractory status. It is also important to note that we had no access to patient level data in conducting this analysis. Based on the information from the cost-eff ectiveness analyses from our literature search, the large number of treatments, and th e lack of patient level data, we decided to use a partitioned survival analysis approach for the economic model. We also relied on the NICE Technical Document on the appropriate use of partitioned survival analyses for decision modeling in health care to help inform our choice (129). Partitioned survival analysis Partitioned survival models, often referred to as \"Area Under the Curve\" models, are a common choice for determining cost-effectivene ss for cancer treatments. As with other types of cost-effectiveness models, patients are tracked through different pre-defined health states. A typical partitioned survival model for cancer treatments includes three states, 1) progression-free, 2) progressed, and 3) dead, and is characterized by two survival curves, PFS and OS ( Figure 19). State membership is derived from the survival curves at each model cycle. Note that the ar ea under the OS curve includes all patients who are alive, but some are in the progression-free state (area under the PFS curve) and others are in the progressed state (area between the PFS and OS curves), i.e., the states are not mutually exclusive. State me mbership is determined as follows: the percent dead at any time is 1 minus the OS curve at each point in time. Similarly, 10 All drug costs are based on 2022 price agreements. O ther costs, e.g., patient travel, doctor/nurse time, drug administration costs, etc. wer e calculated earlier using 2021 prices . We decided not to update these prices in the most recent model update, following change s to clinical effect results, as they represent a very small portion of total treatment cost and would not change the overall results of our analysis. 89 Health economic evaluation membership in the progressed state is the difference between the OS and PFS curves at each time point (129). While it is possible to include additional states in a partitioned survival analysis to capture, for example, a state that identifies a second treatment after progression on the first, the information re quirement generally makes that impossible without access to patient level data. Figure 19: Survival Curves and Health States in Partition Survival Analysis OS - PFS = Progressed, PFS = Progression Free, OS = Alive (Progressed + Progression Free) Reporting of results We report model results as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), which measure the additional cost of gaining one additional QALY, relative to the current treatment: An intervention is considered cost-effective if the ICER is below the willingness-to-pay, , for an additional QALY gained, compared to the next best treatment, as expressed in the following decision rule: C /E Because ICERs have poor statistical properties, they are often rearranged to express either incremental net monetary benefit (I NMB) or incremental net health benefit (INHB). A treatment is then considered cost -effective based on the following decision rules: INMB : EC0 INHB : E - C / 0 Absolute shortfall While there is no official Norwegian thre shold value for willingness-to-pay for an additional QALY, the Magnussen group's proposal for how to operationalize the severity criteria suggests that threshold va lues for willingness-to-pay should increase with increases in disease severity, measured as absolute shortfall - the number of healthy life-years lost without treatment (6 ). There has been acceptance for linking willingness-to-pay to disease severity, but no general agreemen t how increases in severity should effect willingness-to-pay. As part of the health-economic analysis, we Progression Free Dead Progressed 90 Health economic evaluation compute absolute shortfall in order to provide decision-makers with a basis for applying the severity criterion. We calculated absolute shortfall, the measure of disease severity recommended in Norw egian priority setting guidelines for the health sector (130), using the following formula: We used undiscounted QALYs for Prognosis (i.e., QALYs remaining for patients with standard of care in absence of interventi on at mean diagnosed age) and QALY (A), which refers to the total am ount of remaining QALYs for a healthy population at the mean diagnosed age (130). We recognize that the ultimate decision about the relevant willingness-to-pay for different levels of absolute shortfall rests with the decision- makers who evaluate this report. Addressing uncertainty We addressed uncertainty in model parameters by c onducting a probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 10,000 random dr aw Monte Carlo iterations. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis accounts for parame ter uncertainty in a model by defining confidence intervals and a relevant statisti cal distribution for each parameter in the model. For each Monte Carlo iteration a value is drawn from the distribution describing each parameter, resulting in new estimates of the benefits and costs of each treatment. Results from the probabilistic sensitivity anal ysis are characterized in a scatter plot of all resulting combinations of costs and he alth benefits, and as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) which show \" the probability that a given intervention is the most costeffective option given the observed data ... the CEAC can show a decisionmaker the probability that, if the intervention is funded or reimbursed, this will be the correct decision \" (131). Finally we presented the cost-effectiveness acceptability frontiers (CEAF) for a range of willingness-to-pay thre sholds to show which strategies are cost effective at a given willingness-to-pay, given its probability of cost effectiveness (131). In comparison to CEACs, which present all strategies and their probability for cost effectiveness, the CEAFs only present strategi es that could be considered cost-effective over a given willingness-to-pay range, and excludes the other strategies. We performed one-way sensitivity analyses in which model parameters were varied individually to determine the variables that had the largest impact on the deterministic cost-effectiveness results. Va riables included in the one-way sensitivity analyses were drug prices; utility values for the progression-free and progressed health states; time costs for doctors, nurses, and patients associat ed with infusions or injections or regular follow-up appointments at the hospital; pati ent transportation costs; and end-of-life costs. Results of one-way sensitivity analys es were presented as Tornado diagrams. Because of the high prices of myeloma drugs, we planned to conduct a scenario analysis to capture the reduction in drug costs attrib utable to dose reductions resulting from treatment discontinuation because of toxici ty or other problems. By subtracting the accumulated costs at median time-to-di scontinuation from accumulated costs at median time-to-progression we planned to es timate differences in total drug costs resulting from dose reductions. Model structure We used TreeAge (127) to develop a partit ioned survival analysis model with three states: 1) Progression-free, 2) Progressed, and 3) Dead, to examine the cost- effectiveness of 13 different treatments for patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. 11 The model relies on monthly cycles in order to accumulate costs 11 We were unable to include in the health economic analyses one treatment, doxorubicin + bortezomib [DoxV]), that was included in the list of treatments relevant for Norway us ed in the clinical effect section of 91 Health economic evaluation based on standard treatment protocols. The health outcome, QALY are accumulated on an annual basis. In cost-utility analyses based on a single trial, the survival curves for the treatment group are often modeled by multiplying the survival curves for the comparator group by the relevant HRs reported in the trial. When a NMA is used to compare multiple treatments-based results from several different trials, there is no \"comparator\" as such, but comparisons within the network can be made by designating a \"reference treatment\" and using the relevant HRs from the matrix of results to define survival curves for all treatments of interest relative to the reference treatment. We originally intended to use [R + d] as the reference treatment for the model. However, when we generated the OS and PF S curves by applying the appropriate HRs from the NMA to the OS and PFS curves for [R + d], five of the interventions showed PFS curves that were entirely above the OS cu rve - an invalid outcome. This problem may be explained by a variety of factors, including but not limited to, use of mean HRs rather than study-level HRs, undetected inconsiste ncy in the NMA, possible violations of the additivity assumption necessary for a component NMA, violations of the proportional hazards assumption within one or more of the included studies, limitations in the approach used to impute re ference survivor functions, and the fact that the included studies, and hence the NMA and partitione d survival analysis, did not account for correlations between PFS and OS. Issues such as these are di scussed in more detail in the NICE Technical Support Document (129). Table 17: Treatments included in the health economic model Treatments by Reference Group Reference treatment: R + d R + d DR + d RK + d ER + d IR + d Reference treatment: V + d V + d DK + d K + d FV + d DV + d Reference treatment: P + d P + d EP + d IsP + d survival curves reso lved when, as had been suggested by our clinical expert, we divided the model into three disconnected reference groups, each with its own reference treatment ( Table 17). We fitted parametric survival curves for OS and OFS for each of the reference treatments based on Kaplan-Meier plots of the the report. Because in the clinical trial comparing [D oxV] to bortezomib (Velca de), dexamethasone was not included in either arm, we would have needed to include a new reference treatment and generate new survival curves in order to evalua te it. It was not one of the medications of interest mentioned in our original commission. 92 Health economic evaluation respective outcomes in clinical trials. Each reference treatment serves as the \"comparator\" for the other tr eatments included in the group. The survival curves for the remaining treatments in each group were generated by applying the relevant HRs from the NMA to the parametric survival curves for the reference treatments. In essence, the complete model comprises thr ee models, each tracking state membership and the accumulation of QALY and treatment costs over time for the treatments within a specific reference group ( Figure 20). Figure 20: Model schematic For the [R + d] and [V + d] reference groups, the boxes with three dots indicate that other treatments, each with a set of PFS and OS survival curves, are included in the analysis. In the [R+d] group the additional treatments are [KR + d], [ER + d], and [IR + d]. In the [V + d] group the additional treatments are [K + [FV lenalidomide, V: bortezomib Fitting survival curves for reference treatments To specify the OS and PFS curves for each of the reference treatments, we relied on a survival fitting technique and associated Excel spreadsheet prop osed by Hoyle and Henley, which can be used to reconstruct th e underlying patient-level data for number of events and censored patients from each trial (132). This technique makes it possible to more accurately de termine the position of points on Ka plan-Meier plots so that they can be expressed as parametric survival cu rves for use in the cost-utility model. 93 Health economic evaluation 1. For each of the three reference treatments , we selected the relevant study with the largest patient populations that reported results for both OS and PFS. We then used WebPlotDigitizer (27) to ex tract data from the Kaplan-Meier plots that defined the survival curves by reco rding the percentage of patients on each survival curve at each time point wh ere that information was shown on the Kaplan-Meier plot. 2. Because it is difficult to determine th e exact position of points on published survival plots using WebPlotDigitizer, we entered this data into the Excel worksheet from the Hoyle and Henley article (132) to determine more precisely the number of events and censored patients in a given time interval. To ensure that the point estimates were extracted accurately, we checked for the censored patients and events between intervals, and callibrated the points manually to adjust for any corrections 12 (Appendix 13). 3. The patient level data extracted in step s 1 and 2 were imported to R Studio (133) to estimate parametric survival functions and parameters for OS and PFS using Lognormal, Exponential and Weib ull distributions. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and visual inspection we decided that the Weibull distribution provided the best fit for the reference curves, and the values for the shape and scale variables to parametize the survival functions in TreeAge (127). Model parameters Table 18 provides the point estimates and confid ence intervals for all parameters used in the model. The parameters are grouped by variable type and include: 1) HRs for OS and PFS from the NMA detailed in the clinica l effect section of the report, 2) utility weights used to capture QoL gains (or losses) and are used to derive QALYs, and 3) the likelihood of SAEs. Costs accrued on a monthly basis but were calculated in intervals to account for differences in frequency of dosage over different treatment cycles for each intervention. Utility values for PFS and OS were assumed to be constant across all treatments and were applied based on progressed vs. non-progressed status. A 95% confidence interval was provided for all para meters to account for variable uncertainty in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. A log-normal distribution was used for clinica l effect of treatments expressed as HRs and SAE (presented as incidence rates per person months), Weibull distribution was used for reference survival curves in each subgroup, Gamma distribution for cost of drugs and Beta distribution for utility values and disutility values (134). For each treatment, we imputed expected numbers of SAEs as follows. First, we reconstructed the survivor function for the trea tment's reference ([R + d], [V survival cu rves for reference treatments\". We then imputed the total exposure time for the pati ents allocated to the reference on the trial from which the survivor function was imputed. Total exposure time was imputed as the product of mean OS time (area under the reconstructed survivor function; ref) and the number of patients allocate d to the reference treatment ( ref). We then imputed SAE rate for the reference as the ratio of th e number of SAEs among patients allocated to the reference ( ref) to the corresponding imputed total exposure time (refref). The imputed SAE rate for a given reference is therefore ref refrefref . Monthly numbers of SAEs for non-reference treatments were then imputed by applying IRRs (taken from the NMA) to the rates imputed for the 12 The table for summary of point calibration process on the Kaplan Meier plots fo r survival curves under Appendix 13 summarizes the process to determine the number of events and censored patients based on the Kaplan Meier data available for the reference curve from the trials. 94 Health economic evaluation references. For example, the SAE ra te for treatment A was imputed as A IRRA, refref, where IRRA, refIRAIRref is the estimated ratio of the incidence rate for treatment A (IRA) to that for the reference treatment (IRref). The 95% confidence intervals on the IRRs were used to obtain confidence intervals on the imputed SAE rates. The incidence rate for SAE was reported in per person months for the economic model, details of IRR are provided in th e NMA section of the report (see Results - Severe adverse events ). The utility (for PFS and OS) was adjusted using the utility decrement and multiplying them by the Incidence Risk (IR) for each of the respective treatments.

The base-case included all direct me dical cost of treatment (drug cost, infusion, injections, and including nursing hours), doctor visits, pa tient cost for drug administration, visits to doctor and the patient's travel cost for a return journey for drugs administration. Drug prices were based on confidential, ne gotiated prices (LIS price), when an agreement existed. If no ne gotiated price existed, we used the maximum pharmacy sales price (AUP) based on information from the Norwegian Medicines Agency ( Table 19) (135). The information regarding the dosa ges and treatment protocols for different drugs and combinations of drugs was ta ken from The Norwegian Pharmaceutical Product Compendium (Felleskatalogen) summary of product characteristics (136). We assumed patients receiv ed medications in tablet form when available. For drugs that could be administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, we have used the subcutaneous mode, the preferred method based on expert advice, unless the intravenous was specified. For the dosing sche dules, we assumed a bo dy weight of 72,1 kg and body surface area of 1,82 m 2. Most drug regimens were based on cycles of four weeks, three weeks or both depending on the specific drugs included in the combination therapy. To calculate costs for each tr eatment, we created an Excel sheet to track weekly costs: 1. For each treatment, we determined th e treatment protocols for each included medication based on dosing information in Felleskatalogen. These are the protocols used in the trial on which a treatment was approved for use by the European Medicines Agency. Most treatmen ts are based on four-week cycles, but some are based on three-week cycles. 2. For each week in a cycle we noted, for ea ch medication, the required dose (in mg) and the days on which the medication was ta ken. This allowed us to calculate the total doses per medication per week. 3. We then calculated the total cost of ea ch medication by a pplying the cost per dose. Because medications are often availa ble in packages of varying sizes, and contain tablets, powder for infusions, or liquid for injections, we selected the packaging option that resulted in the lowest price per dose. 4. To the medication costs, we added the rele vant costs for regular doctor visits and testing, costs associated with attendance at the clinic for injections or infusions, and patient travel and time costs. 5. For treatment protocols that change af ter a specified number of cycles, we adjusted the dosage information to reflec t the new number of doses per week for each medication in the treatment for wh ich a revised dose was specified. 6. If a treatment protocol limits the number of weeks during which patients receive a specific medication, we stopped accruing those drug costs at that point, but continued to include the costs for regular doctor visits, tests, and patient travel expenses and time. We converted all weekly cycle costs into monthly costs for our analysis. For drug regimens that followed a 3-week cycle we multiplied total treatment costs during a cycle by 0.75 to convert the cost to a monthly cycle (4 week). 13 All drug costs are based on 2022 price agreements, or AUP (maximum pharmacy sales price) if no price agreement existed. Other costs, e.g., patient travel, do ctor/nurse time, drug administration costs, etc. were calculated earlier using 2021 prices. We decided not to update these prices in the most recent model update, following changes to clinical effect results, as they represent a ve ry small portion of total treatment cost and would not change the ov erall results of our analysis. 96 Health economic evaluation Table 19: Drug prices excluding VAT in NOK Drug name Admin mode Active ingredient per unit Units per package Package Cost (NOK) Source Lenalidomide (R) tablet 25 mg/tb. 21 tb.

Administration costs are based on the unit cost database develo ped by the Norwegian Medicines Agency (Table 20) (137). The rate provided for intravenous administration is for 30-60 minutes infusion and includes nu rse time, consumables, work costs of the hospital pharmacy, additives, and overhead cost. We have assumed 10 minutes extra nurse time for each extra hour of infusion time. The rate provided for subcutaneous injection includes nurse time, consumables, work cost for the hospital pharmacy, additives, and overhead costs. Based on ex pert input, we excluded the costs of pre- medication, but have assumed 10 minutes extr a nurse time for treatment. The infusion time for drug treatments is based on expert input. We did not include the cost of adverse events because of large variation in which events were reported across trials and lack of in formation about when adverse events were most likely to occur. We considered including the costs of reported incidents of sepsis, because according to our clinical expert this is most likely to result in hospitalizations. However, the number of sepsis events was relatively small and seemed to affect a similar percent of patients across treatmen ts. We estimated the potential impact of sepsis hospitalizations on total cost to be quite small relative to the cost of the treatment medications and deci ded not to include sepsis hospitalization costs in the model. The cost of doctor visits (out-patient a ppointment with doctor and blood tests) per treatment cycle are based on expert opinion an d charged as monthly visits in the model in accordance with the type of treatment. The costs include consultation time for the doctor and the cost of blood tests. If a trea tment regimen is based on oral medications, patient hospital visits occur once per treatment cycle. In accordance with existing Norwegian guidelin es (137), we used the value of free time, as provided in the Norwegian Medicines Agen cy unit cost database , to account for the time patients spend related to treatment. We also included patients' transportation costs based on the rate in th e NOMA unit cost database. Patients who progress, stop receiving trea tment medications, but continue to have doctor visits including necessary blood te sts, at the same intervals as before progression, until they begin a new treatmen t. Because it is difficult to know the amount of time between progression and beginning of a new treatment, we included the costs of doctor visits and blood tests for progressed patient but excluded the costs of travel time and patient time to avoid over-estimating costs fo r progressed patients. 97 Health economic evaluation Lastly, we included the cost of death (end-o f-life costs) based on the diagnosis related groups (DRG) reimbursement system assumed for 14 days as an exit cost when patients die (135).

Because our health economic model used three reference treatments rather than a single comparator, we used the reference treatments as a basis for the subgroup analysis to calculate absolute shortfall fo r each subgroup analysis indi vidually, and then calculated the mean absolute shortfall for all reference groups ( Table 21) (6). Table 21: Absolute shortfall for reference treatments Prognosis Remaining QALYS Reference Absolute shortfall 3.34 15.8 Rd 12.46 0.85 15.8 Pd 14.95 2.50 15.8 Vd 13.30 Average: 13.57 Average age at diagnosis is assumed to be 65 years old. The severity calculation shows that based on a mean age at diagnosis of 65, the mean loss of \"healthy life-years\" for a person receiving any of th e reference treatments would range from 12.46 to 14.95 QALYs compared to a healthy individual with no disease. Although the calculations of absolute shor tfall were not based on a single common comparator, the differences in absolute shor tfall among the three reference groups are relatively small. The ultimate decision about an appropriate threshold based on the computed levels of absolute shortfall lies with the decision-makers. Total costs and effects based on negotiated drug prices The results for the reference groups [R + d], [V + d] and [P + d] calculated using probabilistic values in the model are presented in Table 22, Table 23,and Table 24, respectively, for a 20 year-time horizon. We also presented the deterministic base-case results of cost-effectiveness re sults for all subgroups in the Appendix 14: Deterministic results for all subgroups . To calculate incremental costs and effects for treatments in each reference group, the treatments were ranked in TreeAge from the lowest cost to the highest cost strategy. A treatment is considered \"dominated\" if it has a combination of higher costs and lower health benefits than another treatment, i. e., it lies to the left and above another treatment on a graph that measures costs on th e vertical axis and health benefits on the horizontal axis. 14 If one treatment has both higher co sts and higher health benefits than another treatment, then the decision about whether it should be approved, will depend on whether the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with the costlier, more effective treatment relative to the less expe nsive, less effective treatment is above or below the willingness-to-pay of the decision makers. Within each reference group (Rd, Vd, and Pd), we report total costs and total benefits for each treatment within the group, but only report incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for treatments not dominated by other treatments. ICERs reported in the tables were calculated based on ex cluding the dominated strategies. 14 In some cases, a treatment can be dominated with respect to a combination of two other treatments. This is referred to as being \"extended dominated\". 99 Health economic evaluation In the [R + d] reference group ( Table 22), Rd had the lowest cost and [DR + d] the highest cost ( Appendix 14: Cost effectiveness frontier [R + d]). Rd was the treatment with the lowest health effect, measured in qualit y-adjusted life-years (QALYs). [DR + d] had the effect as measured in QALYs. (see Appendix 14: Cost effectiveness frontier [R + d]). the [V + d] reference group [V + d] had the lowest treatment cost while [DK + d] had the highest costs Table 23. [V + d] had the lowest effect (QALYs) and [DV + d] had the highest effect (QALYs) in the model (see Appendix 14: Cost effectiveness frontier [V + d]). In the [P + d] reference group ( Table 24), treatment costs were lowest for [P + d] and highest for [IsP + d]. However, [P + d] had th e lowest effect and [EP + d] had the highest effect of treatment in term of QALYs (see Appendix 14: Cost effectiveness frontier [P + d]). For each subgroup in Table 22 ([R + d]), Table 23 ([V + d]) and Table 24 ([P + d]) we also reported health effects in terms of life -year gains, however, these were not used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. CostEffectiveness In the cost-effectiveness analysis for the [R + d] group only three strategies were not dominated by other treatments ([R + d], [IR + d], [DR [V + d] and [DV + d] were not dominated by other tr eatments.

However, the probability of cost effectiveness for [R + d] decrease d significantly for higher willingness-to-pay values such as above NOK XXXXXXX per QALY at which [IR + d] had highest probability of cost effectiveness (47%). The probability of [IR + d] being cost effective reached its highest level (50%) at the willingness-to -pay threshold of NOK XXXXXXXXX per QALY (Figure willingness-to-pay NOK XXXXXXXXX per QALY only [DR + d] was found to be cost effective with a lower prob ability cost effectiveness compared to [IR + d] (38% - 40%). The CEAFs presented in the Appendix 14: Cost Effectiveness Acceptability Frontiers for all subgroups , show the strategies that have the hi ghest probability of cost effectiveness for a gi ven range of willingness-to-pay thre shold. Figure 22 presents the uncertainty among all tr eatment strategies by showing the variation of combinations cost and effects in the probabilistic simulations.

The probabil ity of cost effectiveness for a willingness-to-pay value above NOK XXXXXXX per QALY favoured [DV + d], as it was found to have a high probability of cost effectiveness compared to all other stra tegies (ranging between 38% - 60% as willingness-to-pay increased). The CEAFs presented in the Appendix 14: Cost Effectiveness Acceptability Frontiers for all subgroups showed the same results as the CEACs. Figure 24 presents the uncertainty among all strategies (i.e., treatments) by showing the spread of cost and effects in the probabilistic simulations. [DK + d] was found to have the highest variation of cost and ef fects, indicating highest uncertainty.

We performed a NMAs to facilitate comparisons between treatments that have not been directly compared in any of the included studies. NMAs were performed on five pre-selected outcomes: OS, QoL, SAE, PFS, and discontinuation due to advers ev ents. The evidence base for the analysis comprised of 51 articles reporting on 37 RC Ts, all studying the effect of various treatment regimens containing at least one of the following drugs: patients, the highest ra nked relevant treatment regimens for our selected outcomes were: [DR d] [KR and [IsP + d] for discontinuations due to adverse events, respectively. Radar plots illustrate the relative efficacy for each relevant treatment regimen with respect to our pre-selected outcomes. For non- refractory patients, examples of relevant treatment regimens with favorable HRs for OS that also rank highly with respect to other outcomes include [EP + d], + (Figure 15). For patients who are refractory to lenalidomide (R) ( Figure 16), bortezomib (V) ( Figure 17), and lenalidomide (R) and bortezomib (V) ( Figure 18), examples of relevant treatment regimens wi th favorable HRs for OS that also rank highly with respect to other outcomes, include [DK + d], [EP + d] and [IsP + d]. However, comparing the over all effect of the various treatment regimens across outcomes is challenging, as not all treatm ent regimens have data on all outcomes, and some treatment regimens show better effe ct on one outcome, while having poorer effect on other outcomes, and vice versa. While radar plots such as Figure 15, Figure 16, Figure 17, and Figure 18 may be useful for understandin g tradeoffs between efficacy and safety, they should not be interpreted in isolation. Furthermore, comparing the different treatment regimens is complicated further beca use our confidence in the results varies considerably across treatment regimens and outcomes. The certainty of evidence from the systematic review As previously described, we used the GRAD E approach in assessing the certainty of evidence. The main advantage of using GR ADE is that it makes our judgements transparent and open to criticism. Even though the GRADE ap proach provides a framework to evaluate the certainty of evidence in a systematic manne r, it still relies on subjective judgement. We therefore acknowledge that others may rate the evidence differently than we have. We did not assess certainty of evidence of effect estimates calculated across networks, because the GRADE approach has not yet been extended to component NMA. The effect estimates are instead calculated based on an assumption that allows the available 112 Discussion evidence to be synthesized within a single model, e.g., common treatment components (see the Method chapter: Dealing with disconnected networks of evidence for a more detailed description). As such, we caution against putting too much weight on these effect estimates Strengths and weaknesses of the method and evidence base A general strength of this HTA is that th e work has been performed in a systematic manner in accordance with our published project plan ( Appendix 2). Throughout the process, at least two researchers have in dependently selected studies and extracted data, as well as independently assessed th e methodological quality of the included studies (risk of bias), and our confidence in the results (GRADE). As such, we are confident that we have taken reasonable steps to produce a trustworthy health technology assessment. Furthermore, as we have regularly updated our systematic literature search throughout this process, we are confident that we have identified all relevant studies published prior to January 2022. We identified very few RCTs for each specif ic treatment regimen. Because of this, we chose to pool all treatment regimens cont aining the same combinations of drugs independent of posology (i.e., dose, admini stration form, etc.), to ensure having sufficiently connected networks in the NMA. Also, we chose to regard all treatment regimens containing the same cytostatic drugs, but different glucocorticoids (e.g., dexamethasone and prednisone) as th e same treatment regime (see the Method chapter: Treatment definition for a more thorough descri ption). For example, if treatment regimen 1 contained drug A + drug B + dexamethasone, and treatment regimen 2 contained drug A + drug B + pr ednisone, we regarded these treatment regimens as the same, with the abbreviated denotation [AB + d] (d is dexamethasone or another glucocorticoid). Despite this, the ef fect estimates for the individual treatment regimens are still based on a limited pool of evidence, which is a clear limitation. Potential biases in review process Pooling all treatment regime ns across dose, administrati on form, and dose interval, caused several studies to be reduced to \"single arm\" trials without a comparison. Consequently, these studies were left out of our statistical analysis (45, 52, 53, 62, 63, 74, 84, 90, 94, 97, 103, 104, 106, 109). In doing so, potential nuances in treatment effect due to posology may have been lost. In a ddition, a few articles were omitted from the statistical analysis of QoL, due to the requir ed data not being available in a format that we needed, and/or not compatible with our planned meta-analysis (26, 49, 51, 61, 70, 79, 80, 86, 93). As such, the meta-analysis for QoL is based on very limited data from few studies (25, 30, 59, 66, 70, 73, 75, 89, 95), and the results should therefore be interpreted with extreme caution. All inclu ded studies that were omitted from our statistical analysis are presented with reason for omission in Appendix 7. The main outcome in this report is OS, and our analysis included survival data published from 27 RCTs. Several ongoing stud ies are investigating OS , but as they have not presented their immature data (with HR s), we could not include these studies in our meta-analysis. However, so me of the studies included in our analysis of OS present data (with HRs) that were immature at the time of publication. We cannot disregard the possibility that studies publishing immature survival data have found the results to be more promising than studies that did not publish immature data. Furthermore, the immature survival data may change over time with longer follow-up. As such, there are potential biases that could affect our meta-analysis of OS, and therefore we strongly advice to interpret these results with caution. Strengths and weaknesses of the statistical analysis The main strengths of the statistical analysis are that we used appropriate methods to synthesize the available evidence and provide estimates of relative treatment effect and reported the analyses thoroughly and transp arently. In addition, based on input from 113 Discussion our clinical expert, we systematically review ed the evidence for effect modification of HRs for OS and PFS with respect to refractory status and number of previous lines of treatment. This work is curre ntly available as a preprint (34). Briefly, this work suggests that the evidence for effect modifi cation is very weak, and simulations suggest that any effect modification, should it occur, is unlikely to substantially impact random effects component NMAs, as used herein. Ho wever, the following potential limitations should also be taken into consideration. Due to the nature of the included studies, we were unable to use the planned treatment definitions that would have allowed us to ch aracterize differences in relative treatment effect associated with differences in posology. Because the included studies defined disconne cted networks, we had to use component NMA. While we prespecified that we might do this, we were unable to formally test the assumption that the treatments can be mode lled in this way. We therefore rely on a conceptual evaluation of the validity of this assumption across networks, however we did confirm that estimates are consistent between regular NMAs of each subnetwork and component NMA of the full disconnected networks. In principle we could have taken the comp onent approach further and treated each distinct drug as a component, such that tr iplet regimens would ha ve been modelled as a linear combination of three components, for example. We chose not to do this because we judged the required assumption to be hard er to justify \u2014 for example, it is possible that two \"active\" drugs used in combination may have a very different effect than the sum of the two used alone. We hope to expl ore this approach in subsequent research, but it was not possible within the scope of this project. We combined trial arms as necessary to include some studies that had compared different posologies of the same drug or drug combination. The advantages of this approach are that it allows more evidence to be included in meta-analysis and it is the approach recommended by Coch rane. However, the method may lead to estimates of relative treatment effect that are biased towa rd posologies not used in clinical practice (e.g., toward a lower dose found not to be sufficiently effective, or toward a higher dose found to be poorly tolerated) . If instead we had taken a ma ximalist stance with respect to the granularity of treatment definition, drawing hard distinctions between dose, schedule, and route of administration, it is unlikely that evidence synthesis would have been possible. With respect to QoL (a primary outcome), we extracted and anal ysed difference in mean EORTC QLQ-C30 global health scores. QLQ-C30 is not the only tool used to assess QoL in this literature, however it was the one for which data were most complete. In principle we could have incorporated data from other tools by transforming to a common scale such as Standardized Mean Diff erence (SMD). However, we judged that this would not meaningfully increase the amount of data available and would substantially complicate the an alysis and its interpretation. QLQ-C30 data were typically not reported by the included studies or could not be extracted in a way that easily facilitates meta-analysis. While point estimates were often available, statements of precision we re not. It is essential to characterize precision because this information is nece ssary to perform meta -analysis. It was therefore necessary to impute precisi on, which we did by assuming a common standard deviation (cf. standard error) for all included studies. While we evaluated this assumption where possible and found broad agreement with published results, the approach can only provide approximate standa rd errors. Our meta-a nalytical estimates for this outcome should therefore be interpreted cautiously. We analysed SAE (i.e., adverse events grade 3 and 4) using incidence rate ratios (IRRs). Because information on total exposure was lacking, it was necessary to impute point estimates, using component network meta-analy tical estimates of HRs for OS as a proxy for relative expected OS time. This is likely to introduce some bias. However, note that 114 Discussion we accounted for the uncertainty on our esti mates of HR used in the imputation. We judged that it was reasonable to perform this imputation for SAEs (rather than fail to analyze this outcome) because SAE is a pati ent important outcome. However, we chose not to report the planned analysis of adve rse events (which would require the same type of imputation) to limit possible over interpretation of results. This was a \"borderline\" decision, and others may reasonab ly have chosen to also report estimates for adverse events, or not to have meta -analysed either outcome in this way. The key assumption underpinning the use of IRR is that events (i.e., SAEs) occur independently of one another. This might not be true from the perspective of an individual patient: a patient who experiences one SAE might be at higher or lower risk of a subsequent SAEs, because of the previous one. However, the assumption is probably reasonable from the perspective of a health system, in which patients can be viewed as presenting with SAEs at an averag e rate. We note that HTA are generally best interpreted from this health system (i.e., population) perspective, rather than the perspective of an individual patient. Due to limitations of the available data and software used, it was not possible to use funnel plots to assess possible publication bias, as we had planned to do. It is therefore possible that the literature on this disease does not include studies that estimated smaller or even opposite rela tive treatment effects compared to those we were able to include. We were able to analyse inconsistency as planned by comparing direct, indirect, and network estimates (and found no evidence of inconsistency), but we were unable to perform other planned analyses beca use there were no closed loops. While we planned to account for heteroge neity using random effects, it was not possible to estimate variance components for all outcomes, and in these cases the model used is equivalent to a fixed (common) effects model. Finally, the software we used did not allow us to report prediction intervals, so we are unable to make predictions about what future studies may report. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence from systematic review Most of the included RCTs are international studies, predominately conducted in North America and Europe. Only a few of the in cluded studies report the distribution of ethnicity/race within their study populati on. In these studies, the majority of participants are \"white\" or \"Caucasian\", and only a small number are of other ethnicities such as \"black\" or Asian. A few included studies have be en conducted either regionally, e.g., in Scandinavia (25), or nationally, e.g., in China (37). The China Continuation Study is a small, local expans ion study based on the large, international TOURMALINE-MM1 study (95), but with an entirely Chinese study population (37). The study participants in the China Continuation study are slightly younger, with shorter disease duration, but still with similar di stribution regarding th e ISS stage (multiple myeloma International Stagin g System), which suggest a more aggressive disease compared with the general study population in the TOURMALINE-MM1 study (37, 95). These disparities could be a result of ethnicity, as ethnic differences are evident in the epidemiology of multiple myel oma: \"Blacks\" have increased risk of multiple myeloma compared with \"Whites\", but possibly with less aggressive disease (139, 140). Asians on the other hand, have lower risk of mult iple myeloma than \"Whites\", though the incidence seems to be increasing (140-142). The China Continuation study also showed that the patients had a higher exposure to ixazomib (i.e., area under the curve = blood c oncentration over time), than patients in the TOURMALINE-MM1 study, despite having the same posology for the same treatment regimen (37, 95). Ethnic divers ity in drug response has been shown in several studies, and Asian pa tients have been shown to be more susceptible to the effect of some chemothera peutics agents (143-145). 115 Discussion The results for OS in the China Continua tion Study and the LEPUS study seem to deviate from the findings in the larger international studies (TOURMALINE-MM1 and CASTOR) for the same comparisons. This can be interpreted as an indication that ethnicity is an effect modifier. Interestingl y, when considering the PFS results, we see no discrepancies between the Chinese and inte rnational studies. Further research may reveal that ethnicity is indeed an effect modifier, and that different ethnicities should be considered separately. In our view there is currently not sufficient evidence for such an approach, and we have therefore consider ed all ethnicities together, as is current practice among RRMM trialists and systematic review authors. In light of all this, we caution against over interpreting our result s regarding OS, as we are uncertain about how applicable they are to a Norwegian setting. Still, one clinical expert had major conc erns about the inclusion of the China Continuation Study, which compared [IR + d] an d [R + d] in that 1) the results in this specific trial are not applicable to the No rwegian setting because all patients were Chinese and 2) patients had received care before and during th e trial that likely differed from current Norwegian clinical practice. We therefore performed a non-prespecified sensitivity analysis to address these concerns. that The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that excluding the China Continuation Study (which meets our prespecified inclusion criteria) has a substa ntial impact on the results, leading to a marked drop in the ranking of [IR + d] for OS but not PFS ( Figure 8 and Figure 13). This was not surprising, since our assessm ent of the certainty of the underlying evidence for the [IR + d] ranking in our main analysis was very low, largely due to the discrepancy in the findings from China Continuation Study and TOURMALINE-MM1 (which also compared [IR + d] and [R + d]). It may appear that excluding the China Continuation Study solves the discrepancy, bu t the result may still be misleading for at least two reasons. First, using trial results to justify deviating from protocol and excluding trials that meet pr especified inclusion criteria may lead to results that do not answer the original research question, and is usually cautioned against, e.g. in The Cochrane Handbook chapte r on heterogeneity: \" In general it is unwise to exclude studies from a metaanalysis on the basis of their results as this may introduce bias \" (146). Second, there are aspects of both the TOURMALINE-MM1 and the China Continuation Study that may limit their applicability to the Norwegian context. As pointed out by the TOURMALINE-MM1 investigators: In the Ch ina Continuation Study only 50% of the patients who experienced disease progression received any subsequent therapy, and those that did lacked \" access to the broader range of approved or investigational agents and regimens available to patients in North America and Europe \" (38). On the other hand, like the China Continuation Study, TOURMALINE-MM1 was double blinded, and the blinding remained after disease progression, which meant that \" equal proportions of blinded patients received PI or nonPI treatment as nextline therapy in each arm \" (38). The TOURMALINE-MM1-investigators state that \" patients progressing on placebo Rd\" ... \" were more likely to remain PIsensitive and therefore benefit from PIbased next line therapy\u2014representing a de facto crossover \" (38). In addition: \" Daratumumab became clinically available for the treatment of RRMM shortly after completion of enrollment to TOURMALINE MM1. Among TOURMALINE MM1 patients receiving subsequent daratumumab, there was an OS trend in favor of placeboRd (HR 1.15). We hypothesize that this could be because of placeboRd patients receiving daratumumab earlier and in larger numbers than ixazomib Rd patients \" (38). In summary, there are problems with the interpretation of the esti mates of HRs for OS in both these studies, and we believe the most appropriate option is to include both studies in our main analysis, in line with our protocol and Co chrane handbook guidance, while emphasising that the certainty of our findings on the effe ctiveness of [IR + d] on OS, is very low. It is common for studies that compare the same treatments to provide differing results. This is called heterogeneity and is typically addressed in meta-analysis using random effects, as in this report, which estimate the average of the treatment effects that such 116 Discussion trials estimate. It is then important th at estimates of average effect are not misinterpreted as being equivalent to study-level estimates, and that possible explanations for heterogeneity are considered (e.g., differences due to trial design and conduct, as well as the play of chance). Generalisability to a clinical setting The goal of systematic reviews is to summarise available evidence that meet a defined set of criteria. Regardless of the amount and quality of evidence that can be included in a systematic review, it is important to remember that systematic reviews and meta- analyses, as well as single studies, typica lly report treatment effects that do not necessarily reflect the treatment effect for an individual patient. In other words, our findings are probably most usefully interpreted at the health system, rather than individual patient level. Consistency of systematic review with other reviews We have identified four systematic revi ews that have evaluated the efficacy of treatment regimens for relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma, published between 2017 and 2020 (12, 13, 17, 35). All studies reported on PFS (12, 13, 17, 35). In addition, Luo et al also reported on OS (12). Similar to our results, Luo et al found [IR + d] and [DR + d] to be the two highest ranked treatment regimens for OS (12). In contrast, all four systematic reviews found the triple combination daratumumab + lenalidomide + dexamethasone [DR + d] to be the highest ranked treatment regimen for PFS (12, 13, 17, 35), whereas we found [EP + d] to be the highest ranked treatment regimen. However, four of the five highest ranked treatment regimens in our analysis of PFS were not included in the other systematic reviews, likely because the study results were not avai lable. Also, while the systematic review of Dhakal et al was published in 2020, they searched for literature published up to July 2018 (35). As such, findings for several of treatment regimens we included had not yet been published when the earlier systematic reviews conducted their literature search. Our work therefore adds information not available in other similar reviews. Similar to the approach we took, all four systematic reviews assumed that dose, administration methods, and dose intervals have little or no effect, and therefore pooled treatment regimens that contain the sa me drugs but differ in posology (12, 13, 17, 35). According to our clinical experts, this assumption is valid. These other systematic reviews made assumptions similar to the ones we made but they could not have used the component NMA model we empl oyed because it was published after the four systematic reviews. Firstly, in orde r to connect all treatment options into one network, three of the systematic reviews assumed that the relative efficacy of [V + d] vs [d] is equal to that of [V] vs [d], and that [T + d] vs [d] is equal to that of [T] vs [d] (12, 17, 35). Whereas van Beurden-Tan et al states that this assu mption seemed valid from a clinical perspective (17), our clinical ex perts advised against it. Our approach explicitly does not assume that regimens containing a glucocorticoid have the same effect as regimens that do not. Secondly, three systematic reviews used time-to-progression as a proxy for PFS in cases where HRs and 95% confidence interv als were not available (13, 17, 35). We have not made this assumption, and any st udies presenting data without HRs have therefore been omitted from the meta-analysis of PFS. However, we acknowledge that not imputing HRs from times-to-progressi on was a borderline decision and had there been more heterogeneity in reporting we would have pr obably chosen to do it. 117 Discussion Health economic evaluation Key findings of health economic evaluation We conducted a cost utility analysis of 13 tr eatments for patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma using a partiti oned survival analysis model. We expressed health outcomes in QALYs and costs in NOK. We subdivided the model into three treatment groups, each based on one of three reference treatments: Af ter deriving OS and PFS curves for each of the reference treatments, we used HRs from the NMA, conducted as part of the clinical effect and safety portion of the projec t, to generate survival curves for the other treatments in each of the groups. Costs included all direct medica l cost associated with trea tment (drug costs, infusion, injections, nursing hours), doctor visits and test, travel costs for patients, time associated with treatment and doctor visit, and costs related to en d-of-life care. Model results were expressed as ICERs, which refl ect the extra cost of one additional QALY gained. The deterministic model results, in which treatments were ranked in TreeAge from lowest cost to highest cost strate gy within the treatment groups gave the following results, with results rounded to the nearest 1 000 kroner: In the [R + d] group, [R + d] was the lowest cost treatment at NOK XXXXXXX, with 2.90 QALYs gained. Only two other treatments we re not dominated by other treatments: [IR + d], with costs of d]. of and ICER of d]. group both [V + d] and [DV + d] were not dominated by other treatments, [DV + d] with costs of XXXXXXXXX and 3.48 of d]. group both [P + d] and [EP + d] were not dominated by other treatments. [P + d] had costs of XXXXXXX and 0.81 QA LYS and [EP + d] had costs of XXXXXXXXX and QALYs of 1.20 for an ICER of NOK XXXXXXXXX. The results for the probabilistic analysis were presented usin g Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curves (CEACs), which make it possible to determine which treatments had the highest probability of being cost ef fective for varying levels of willingness-to- pay. In the [R + d] group, only [R + d] had the possibility of being cost-effective at willingness-to-pay levels below NOK XXXXXXX. IRd had a 47% probability of cost- -pay levels a 38% - 40% probability of cost-effectiveness but only at willingness-to-pay levels of approximately XXXXXXXXX kroner and above. In the [V + d] group, [V + d] was found to have a high probability of cost effectiveness below the willingness-to-pay of NOK XXXXXXX. For the [DV + d] probability of cost effectiveness was only higher than other treatments above a willingness-to-pay of NOK XXXXXXX but with a lower probability of just 38%. In the [P + d] group, [P + d] had the highest probability of being cost effective over wide willingness-to-pay ranges. [EP + d]'s probabil ity of being cost-effective was 45% - 60%, but only at a willingness-to-p ay of more than NOK XXXXXXXXX. Treatments are generally considered cost-eff ective if the ICER is below the willingness- to-pay for an extra (QALY). Although Norway does not have an official threshold value for willingness-to-pay for an ex tra QALY, the current priority criteria show acceptance for the principle that severity of the diseas e should be considered when making this decision. We computed severity, measured as \"absolute shortfa ll\" for each of the 118 Discussion reference treatments and found that they rang ed from 12.46 to 14.95 lost healthy life- years (average: 13.57). We leave it to the decision-makers to determine the appropriate level of willingne ss-to-pay based on severity. Strengths and weaknesses of the health economic evaluation The primary contribution of this health econ omic evaluation is that it constitutes the largest cost-effectiveness analysis of po tential treatments for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma ever conducted. We eval uated thirteen separate treatments for a disease, whose treatment pathways are extremely complex, without having access to patient level data. As our sea rch for other cost-effectiveness analyses of treatments for multiple myeloma revealed, most other co st-effectiveness analyses of multiple myeloma treatments have examined a single intervention and an established comparator, a few made comparisons between two interventions and a single comparator, or between a single propos ed intervention compared to different established treatments. The largest number of treatments included in a single analysis was in a cost-effectiveness analysis perf ormed by Carlson, et al., which included only six treatments compared in a partitioned survival analysis in which the model was populated with HRs from a small NMA that included only those treatments (126). The most important weakness of the health economic evaluation and, perhaps, of the clinical effect section of this project, is th e high degree of uncertainty surrounding the results. Much of this uncertainty was unavoi dable because our lack of access to patient level data limited our abilit y to derive parametric survival curves that captured relevant patient information. As the survival curves form the basis for estimating total costs and total health benefi ts accumulated during treatm ent, less certainty in the survival curves leads to more uncertainty in the results of the analysis. To investigate the cost-effectiveness of treatments of interest, we needed to use HRs from the NMA of OS and PFS to generate survival curves fo r each treatment relative to its relevant reference treatment ( Table 17). As noted in the discussion describing our decision to divide the model into three treatment groups, there are a variety of potential shortcomings in both the methods used to conduct the NMA and those to generate the survival curves needed for the economic model, that could have increased th e general level of uncertainty around our results. These include, but are not limited to (1) use of mean HRs rather than study- level HRs, undetected inconsistency in the NMA, (2) violations of the proportional hazards assumption within one or more of th e included studies, (3) limitations in the approach used to impute reference surviv or functions, and (4) the fact that the included studies, and hence the NMA and part itioned survival analysis, did not account for correlations between PFS and OS. While the HRs for PFS were all statistically si gnificant, none of the HRs for OS were, and all HR had wide confidence intervals which in troduced more uncertainty in the results. Although we tried to conduct a one-way sensit ivity analysis to dete rmine the impact of variation in the HRs on cost-effectiveness result s, we were unable to do so, because that analyses yielded results showing \"infinite va riation\". This was likely by intersecting survival curves caused by wider co nfidence intervals around the HRs. Because costs of myeloma medications are qu ite high, it is important to account for patients who either receive reduced doses or who discontinue treatment before disease progression. Not doing so would result in an over-estimation of treatment costs and increases in the incremental cost-effective ness ratios. Had survival curves for time to treatment discontinuation been available fo r all treatments, we could have used that information to determine the point at which treatment costs of treatment should stop being \"accumulated\" in the mo del. However, that inform ation was not available so instead we used information about median time-to-discontinuation and median time- to-progression to determine the period of time during which discontinued treatment occurred. While results of the dose reduct ion analysis seemed to provide reasonable 119 Discussion results for some treatments, for three treatmen ts ([DR + d], median time-to-discontinuation was greate r than the median time-to-progression - a result that is inconsistent with clinical expe rience - so we discarded the analysis. This was likely a reflection of other uncertainty in the model. As a result, it is possible that total costs are over-estimated for some treatments. Estimating the five-year budget consequenc es of introducing new treatments in the health care system is normally an important part of a health-economic analysis. Unfortunately, the complexity of clinical decisions regarding which treatments are most appropriate for different patients ma kes it impossible to estimate how many patients might receive a given treatment. Consistency of the health economic evaluation with other studies It is difficult to compare the consistency of health economic results across countries because of variantions in the structure heal th systems and the costs associated with health care. Even if health systems were similar comparing calculations of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios acro ss countries would require not just converting from one currency to another, but also taking into a ccount differences in the inflation rates if studies were conducted in different years. To the extent that different cost-effectiveness analyses report a decision about whether treatments were considered to be cost-effec t, those decisions were sometimes, but not always consistent with what we might susp ect the decision would be in Norway based on similar decisions that have been made in Norway. However, other factors beside the cost-effectiveness of a treatment might coul d account for differen ces in reimbursement choices made in different countries. Need for further research It would be useful if future randomised or perhaps registry-bas ed studies were to directly compare the more effe ctive and safe treatments, rath er than to use one of the few commonly used controls (i.e., the treatmen ts found at the centres of the networks). In addition to providing direct evidence that would be useful in its own right this could allow fully connected networks to be form ed, alleviating the need to assume that treatments can be componentized (and allowi ng that assumption to be tested). This would also allow for inconsistency in the ne twork of evidence to be assessed via closed loops. It may not be feasible to power supe riority trials comparing two highly effective treatments, but noninferiority trials ma y be tractable and could provide useful information (147). However, tr eating relapsed and/or refr actory multiple myeloma is complicated and depends on several factors including prior treatment regimens, as well as aggressiveness of the disease. As such , we do recognize that conducting an ideal study to compare the most effective treatment options may not be feasible. 120 Conclusion Conclusion It is not possible to draw clear, brief con clusions about the clinical effectiveness of the treatments we examined for several reasons including a high degree of uncertainty across most results; the need to consider different outcomes simultaneously; and different considerations across subgroups of patients (e.g., those who are refractory to different drugs). We infer that there is no single treatment regimen that is superior with respect to all outcomes. The six triplet combinations [EP + examples of treatment regimens relevant for non- refractory patients that have clearly favorable HRs for OS, that also are ranked highly with respect to other outcomes. Similarly, th e three triplet combinations [DK + d], [EP + d] and [IsP + d] are examples of treatment regimens that are relevant for patients who are refractory to lenalidomide (R) and/or bortezomib (V), an d that have clearly favorable HRs for OS, and also ranked highly with respect to other outcomes. However, it is important to note the substantial un certainty in the evidence underlying these results. In the [R + d] group, [R + d] was the lowest cost treatment at NOK XXXXXXX, with 2.90 QALYs gained. Only two other treatments we re not dominated by other treatments: [IR + d], with costs of d]. of and ICER of d]. group both [V + d] and [DV + d] were not dominated by other treatments, [DV + d] with costs of XXXXXXXXX and 3.48 of d]. group both [P + d] and [EP + d] were not dominated by other treatments. [P + d] had costs of XXXXXXX and 0.81 QA LYS and [EP + d] had costs of XXXXXXXXX and QALYs of 1.20 for an ICER of NOK XXXXXXXXX. 121 ose. International Myeloma Foundation; 2017. 2.

Clinical efficacy and safety chapter 139 Section/Topic Item # Checklist Item Where Reported Information sources 7 Describe all information sources (e.g., databases with dates of coverage, contact with study authors to identify additional studies) in the search and date last searched. Clinical efficacy and safet y chapter Search 8 Present full electronic search strategy for at least one database, including any limits used, such that it could be repeated. Method chapter and Appendix 3 Study selection 9 State the process for selecting studies (i.e., screening, eligibility, included in systematic review, and, if applicable, included in the meta-analysis). Clinical efficacy and safet y chapter Data collection process 10 Describe method of data extraction from reports (e.g., piloted forms, independently, in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming data from investigators. Clinical efficacy and safety chapter Data items 11 List and define all variables for which data were sought (e.g., PICOS, funding sources) and any assumptions and simplifications made. Clinical efficacy and safet y chapter Geometry of the network S1 Describe methods used to explore the geometry of the treatment network under study and potential biases related to it. This should include how the evidence base has been graphically summarized for presentation, and what characteristics were compiled and used to describe the evidence base to readers. Clinical efficacy and safety chapter Risk of bias within individual studies 12 Describe methods used for assessing risk of bias of individual studies (including specification of whether this was done at the study or outcome level), and how this information is to be used in any data synthesis. Clinical efficacy and safety chapter Summary measures 13 State the principal summary measures (e.g., risk ratio, difference in means). Also describe the use of additional summary measures assessed, such as treatment rankings and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values, as well as modified approaches used to present summary findings from meta-anal yses. Clinical efficacy and safety chapter Planned methods of analysis 14 Describe the methods of handling data and combining results of studies for each network meta-analysis. This should include, but not be limited to: Handling of multi-arm trials; Selection of variance structure; Selection of prior distributions in Bayesian analyses; and Assessment of model fit. Clinical efficacy and safety chapter Assessment of Inconsistenc y S2 Describe the statistical methods used to evaluate the agreement of direct and indirect evidence in the treatment network(s) studied. Describe efforts taken to address its presence when found. Clinical efficacy and safet y chapter Risk of bias across studies 15 Specify any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting within studies). Clinical efficacy and safety chapter Additional analyses 16 Describe methods of additional analyses if done, indicating which were pre- specified. This may include, but not be limited to, the following: Sensitivity or subgroup analyses; Meta-regression analyses; Alternative formulations of the treatment network; and Use of alternative prior distributions for Bayesian analyses (if applicable). Clinical efficacy and safety chapter RESULTS Study selection 17 Give numbers of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at each stage, ideally with a flow diagram. Results chapter 140 Section/Topic Item # Checklist Item Where Reported Presentation of network structure S3 Provide a network graph of the included studies to enable visualization of the geometry of the treatment network. Results chapter Summary of network geometry S4 Provide a brief overview of characteristics of the treatment network. This may include commentary on the abundance of trials and randomized patients for the different interventions and pairwise comparisons in the network, gaps of evidence in the trea tment network, and potential biases reflected by the network structure. Results chapter Study characteristics 18 For each study, present characteristics for which data were extracted (e.g., study size, PICOS, follow-up period) and provide the citations. Results chapter Risk of bias within studies 19 Present data on risk of bias of each study and, if available, any outcome level assessment. Results chapter Results of individual studies 20 For all outcomes considered (benefits or harms), present, for each study: 1) simple summary data for each intervention group, and 2) effect estimates and confidence intervals. Modified approaches may be needed to deal with information from larger networks. Not done \u2014 we judge it excessive to present all raw data in the main repor t Synthesis of results 21 Present results of each meta-analysis done, including confidence/credible intervals. In larger networks, authors may focus on comparisons versus a particular comparator (e.g., placebo or standard care), with full findings presented in an appendix. League tables and forest plots may be considered to summarize pairwise comparisons. If additional summary measures were explored (such as treatment rankings), these should also be presented. Results chapter Exploration for inconsistency S5 Describe results from inve stigations of inconsiste ncy. This may include such information as measures of model fit to compare consistency and inconsistency models, P values from statistical tests, or summary of inconsistenc y estimates from different pa rts of the treatment network. Results chapter Risk of bias across studies 22 Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies for the evidence base being studied. Results chapter Results of additional analyses 23 Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression analyses , alternative network geometries studied, alternative choice of prior distributions for Bayesian analyses, and so forth). Additional analyses not performed DISCUSSION Summary of evidence 24 Summarize the main findings, including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy-makers). Discussion chapter Limitations 25 Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review level (e.g., incomplete retrie val of identified research, reporting bias). Comment on the validity of the assumptions, such as transitivity and consistency. Comment on any concerns regarding network geometry (e.g., avoidance of certain comparisons ).
