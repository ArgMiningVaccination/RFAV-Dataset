JAMA Netw Open ; 4(11): e2132548, the general [population], [veterans]are at high [risk]for COVID-19 and have a complex relationship with the [government]. This potentially [affects]their and Participants:This cross-sectional web-based [survey]study used data from the Department of [Veterans]Affairs (VA) [Survey]of [Healthcare]Experiences of [Patients]' [Veterans]Insight Panel, fielded 12 and 28, 2021. Of 3420 [veterans] [who]were sent [survey], 1178 [veterans](34%) completed the [survey]. Data were analyzed from April 1 to August 25, 2021. Exposures [Veterans]eligible for [COVID-19 vaccines]. Main Outcomes and Measures:The outcomes of interest were [veterans]' experiences with COVID-19, [vaccination]status and [intention]groups, reasons for receiving or not receiving a [vaccine], [self]-reported [health status], and trusted and preferred [sources of information]about [COVID-19 vaccines]. Reasons for not getting vaccinated were classified into categories of [vaccine]deliberation, [dissent], distrust, indifference, skepticism, and [policy]and were 54 and 987 [veterans](84%) were non- [Hispanic] [White]. The mean (SD) age of [respondents]was 66.7 (10.1) years. A total of 817 [respondents](71%) [self]-reported being vaccinated against COVID-19. Of 339 [respondents](29%) [who]were not vaccinated, those unsure of getting vaccinated were more likely to [report]fair or poor [overall health](32 18%-40%). for not being vaccinated were skepticism (120 [respondents][36%] were concerned about side effects; 65 [respondents][20%] preferred using few medications; 63 [respondents][19%] preferred gaining [natural immunity]), deliberation (74 [respondents][22%] preferred to wait because [vaccine]is new), and distrust (61 [respondents][18%] did not [trust]the [health care system]). Among [respondents] [who]were vaccinated, preventing oneself from getting sick (462 [respondents][57%]) and contributing to the end of the COVID-19 pandemic (453 [respondents][56%]) were top reasons for getting vaccinated. All [veterans]reported the VA as 1 of their top trusted [sources of information]. The proportion of [respondents]trusting their VA [health care]practitioner as a source of [vaccine]information was higher among those unsure about [vaccination]compared with those [who]indicated they would definitely not or probably not get vaccinated (18 [respondents][26%] vs 15 [respondents][15%]). There were no significant [associations]between [vaccine] [intention]groups and age (24 = 5.90; P = .21) or [gender](22 = 3.99; P = .14). Conclusions and Relevance These findings provide information needed to develop trusted messages used in conversations between VA [health care]practitioners and [veterans]addressing specific [vaccine hesitancy]reasons, as well as those in worse [health]. Conversations need to emphasize societal reasons for getting vaccinated and benefits to one's own [health]. "}
