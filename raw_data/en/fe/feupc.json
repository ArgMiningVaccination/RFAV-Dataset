U M Sakarkar2 and S B Jaiswal3 of Nagpur Received 17 Janua1y 2003 As the health care professions look seriously at complementary and alternative modalities of medicine , a growing interest in traditional Indian medicine is emerging simultaneously. As with any popular development, aspects of the Indian medical system and its cures have some\u00ad times been appropriated by individuals not wholly familiar with the basics of Ayurveda or the Science of Longevity. Over the past decade, however, a group of dedicated scholars has under\u00ad taken serious study of this ancient healing tradition. It is appropriate to present the fundamental principle s and practices of traditional Ayurveda, as they may be understood from classical San\u00ad skrit sources and traditional Indian practitioners . Traditional Ayurveda is a sophisticated system of medicine that has been practiced in India for over 2,500 years. Like other forms of alternative and complementary medicine, it focuses on the whole organism and its relation to the external world, in order to reestablish and maintain the harmonious balance that exists within the body and between the body and its environment. Only a glimpse of this ancient form of medicine has been offered; there is much to be learned from a deeper exploration of Ayurveda. Here the authors stress the various aspects of traditional practice of an ancient Indian medical science i.e. Ayurveda. Keywords: Ayurveda, Indian medicine . History Based on available literary sources, the history of Indian medicine developed in four main phases. The first, or Vedic phase dates from about 1200 to 800 BC. Information about medicine during this period is obtained from numerous cura\u00ad tive incantation s and references to healing that are found in the Atharvaveda and the Rigveda, two religious scriptures that re\u00ad veal a \"magico-religious\" approach to *Correspondent author healing. The second or classical phase is marked by the advent of the first Sanskrit medical treatises, the Charaka and Su\u00ad shruta Samhitas, which probably date from a few centuries before to several centuries after the start of the Common Era. This period includes all subsequent medical treatises dating from before the Muslim invasions of India at the begin\u00ad ning of the eleventh century, for these works tend to follow the earlier classical compilations closely and provide the ba\u00ad sis of traditional Ayurveda. 334 INDIAN J TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE , VOL 2, No.4, OCTOBER 2003 Clear influences on the classical para\u00ad digm from Islamic or Unani, South Indian Siddha, and other non-classical medical systems mark the third or syncretic phase. Bhavamishra's sixteenth century Bha\u00ad vaprakasha is one text that reveals the results of these influences, which in\u00ad cluded diagnosis by examination of pulse or urine. This phase extends from the early eleventh century to the present era. The final phase as \"New Age Ayurveda ,\" wherein the classical paradigm is being adapted to the world of modern science and technology, including quantum physics, mind-body science, and ad\u00ad vanced biomedical science. These four phases of Indian medical history provide a chronological grid necessary to under\u00ad standing the development of this ancient system of medicine. Theoretical foundations From its beginnings during the Vedic era, Indian medicine always has adhered closely to the principle of a fundamental connection between the microcosm and macrocosm. Human beings are minute representations of the universe, and con\u00ad tain within them everything that makes up the surrounding world. Comprehending the world is crucial to comprehending the human and, conversely, understanding the world is necessary to understanding the human. The human body According to Ayurveda, the cosmos is composed of five basic elements : earth, air, fire, water, and space. Certain forces cause these to interact, giving rise to all that exists. In human beings, these five elements occur as the three doshas, forces that, along with the seven dhatus (tissues) and three malas (waste products), make up the human body. The three doshas When in equilibrium, the three doshas maintain health; but when an imbalance occurs among them, they define the nor\u00ad mal functioning of the body, leading to the manifestation of disease. An imbal\u00ad ance indicates an increase or decrease in one, two, or all three of the doshas. The three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and kapha. Vata or Vayu meaning wind is composed of the element air and space. It is the principle of kinetic energy, and is respon\u00ad sible for all bodily movement and nerv\u00ad ous functions. It is located below the na\u00ad vel, in the bladder, large intestines, nerv\u00ad ous system, pelvic region, thighs, bone marrow, and legs; its principal seat is the colon. When disrupted, its primary mani\u00ad festation is gas and muscular or nervous energy, leading to pain. Pitta, or bile, is composed of the element fire and water. It governs enzymes and hormones, and is responsible for digestion, pigmentation, body temperature, hunger, thirst, sight, courage, and mental activity. It is located between the navel and the chest, the stomach, small intestines, liver, spleen, skin, and blood; its principal seat is the stomach. When disrupted, its primary manifestation is acid and bile, leading to inflammation. Kapha or Shleshman, meaning phlegm, is composed of the elements of earth and water. It connotes the principle of cohesion and stability. It regulates Vata and Pitta, is responsible for keeping the body lubricated and SAKARKAR et al: ESSENCE OF A YURVEDA: THE TRADITIONAL MEDICAL SCIENCE 335 maintaining its solid nature, tissues, sex\u00ad ual power, and strength. It also controls patience. Its normal locations are the up\u00ad per part of the body, the thorax, head, neck, upper portion of the stomach, pleu\u00ad ral cavity, fat tissues, and areas between joints; its\u00b7 principal seat is the lung. When it is disrupted, its primary manifestation is liquid and mucus, leading to swelling, with or without discharge. The attributes of each dosha help to determine the indi\u00ad vidual's basic bodily and mental make up and to isolate which dosha(s) are respon-. sible for a disease. The qualities of Vata are dryness, cold, light, irregularity, mobility, roughness, and abundance. Dryness occurs when Yata is disturbed, and is a side effect of motion. Too much dryness produces ir\u00ad regularity in the body and mind. Pitta is hot, light, intense, fluid, liquid, putrid, pungent, and sour. Heat appears when Pitta is disturbed , resulting from change caused by Pitta. The intensity of exces\u00ad sive heat produces irritability in the body and mind. Kapha is heavy, unctuous, cold, stable, dense, soft, and smooth. Heaviness occurs when Kapha is dis\u00ad turbed, and results from firmness caused by Kapha. The viscosity of excessive heaviness and stability produces slowness in body and mind. The seven dhatus The seven dhatus or tissues are respon\u00ad sible for sustaining the body. Each dhatu is responsible for the one that comes next in the following order. I. Rasa, meaning sap or juice, includes the tissue fluids, chyle, lymph, and plasma, and functions as nourish-ment. It comes from digested food. 2. Blood includes the red blood cells, and functions to invigorate the body. 3. Flesh includes muscle tissue, and functions as stabilization. 4. Fat includes adipose tissue, and func\u00ad tions as lubrication. 5. Bone includes bone and cartilage, and functions as support. 6. Marrow includes red and yellow bone marrow, and functions as filling for the bones. 7. Shukra includes male and female sexual fluids, and functions in repro\u00ad duction and immunity. The three malas These are the waste products of di\u00ad gested and processed food and drink. Ay\u00ad urveda delineates three principal malas, viz. urine, feces, and sweat. A fourth category of other waste products includes fatty excretions from the skin and intes\u00ad tines, earwax, mucus of the nose, saliva, tears, hair, and nails. According to Ayur\u00ad veda, an individual should evacuate the bowels once a day, and eliminate urine six times a day. Ayurveda considers di\u00ad gestion to be the most important function that takes place in the human body. It provides all that is required to sustain the organism and is the principal cause for all maladies from which an individual suf\u00ad fers. The process of digestion and as\u00ad similation of nutrients will be discussed under the topics of the Agnis (enzymes) , Ama (improperly digested food and drink), and the Srotas (channels of circu\u00ad lation). 336 INDIAN 1 TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE . VOL 2. No.4, OCTOBER 2003 The thirteen agnis The Agnis, or enzymes, assist in the digestion and assimilation of food, and are divided into three types. Jatharagni is active in the mouth, stomach, and gas\u00ad trointestinal tract, and helps to break down food. The waste product of feces results from this activity. Bhutagnis are five enzymes located in the liver. They adapt the broken down food into a ho\u00ad mologous chyle according to the five elements, and assist the chyle to assimi\u00ad late with the corresponding five elements in the body. The homologous chyle cir\u00ad culates in the blood channels as Rasa, nourishing the body and supplying the seven dhatus. Dhatvagnis are seven en\u00ad zymes, which synthesize the seven dhatus from the assimilated chyle homologized with the five elements. The remaining waste products result from this activity. Am a Ama, the chief cause of disease, is formed when there is a decrease in en\u00ad zyme activity. A product of improperly digested food and drink, it takes the form of a liquid sludge that travels through the same channels as the chyle. Because of its density, however, it lodges in different parts of the body, blocking the channels. It frequently mixes with the doshas that circulate through the same pathways and it gravitates to a weak or stressed organ, or to a site of a disease manifestation. Since all diseases invariably come from Ama, the word Amaya, meaning \"coming from Ama,\" is a synonym for disease. Internal diseases begin with Ama, and external diseases produce Ama. In gen\u00ad eral, Ama can be detected by a coating on the tongue; turbid urine with foul odour; and feces that is passed with undigested food, an offensive odour, and abundant gas. The principal course of treatment in Ayurveda involves the elimination of Ama and the restoration of the balance of the doshas. The thirteen kinds of srotas The Srotas are the vessels or channels of the body through which all substances circulate. They are either large, such as the large and small intestines, uterus, ar\u00ad teries, and veins, or small, such as the capillaries. A healthy body has open and free-flowing channels. Blockage of the channels, usually by Ama, results in dis\u00ad ease. 1. Pranavahasrotas convey vitality and vital breath (prana) and originate in the heart and alimentary tract. 2. Udakavahasrotas convey water and fluids and originate in the palate and pancreas. 3. Annavahasrotas convey food from the outside and originate in the stomach. 4. Rasavahasrotas convey chyle, lymph, and plasma, and originate in the heart and in the ten vessels con\u00ad nected with the heart. Ama primarily accumulates within them. 5. Raktavahasrotas convey red blood cells and originate in the liver and spleen. 6. Mamsavahasrotas convey ingredi\u00ad ents for muscle tissue and originate in the tendons, ligaments, and skin. 7. Medovahasrotas convey ingredients for fat tissue and originate in the SAKARKAR et al: ESSENCE OF AYURVEDA : THE TRADITIONAL MEDICAL SCIENCE 337 kidneys and fat tissues of the abdo\u00ad men. 8. Asthavahasrotas convey ingredients for bone tissue and originate in hip\u00ad bone. 9. Majjavahasrotas convey ingredients for marrow and originate in the bones and joints. 10. Shukravahasrotas convey ingredients for the male and female reproductive tissues and originate in the testicles and ovary. 11. Mutravahasrotas convey urine and originate in the kidney and bladder. 12. Purishavahasrotas convey feces and originate in the colon and rectum. 13. Svedavahasrotas convey sweat and originate in the fat tissues and hair follicles. This broad outline indicates that Ayur\u00ad veda understands that the human body's anatomical parts are composed of the five basic elements, which have undergone a process of metabolism and assimilation in the body. Human beings differ depending upon their normal bodily constitution (prakriti), which is determined by the factors such as food, drink, regimen, sea\u00ad son, and mental state, suppressed enzyme activity in the body, leading to the forma\u00ad tion of Ama. The circulating Ama blocks the channels. The site of the disease's origin is where the blockage occurs. The circulating Ama, often combining with one or more of the doshas, then takes a divergent course, referred to as the path of transportation . Finally, the dosha(s) and Ama mixture comes to rest in and . afflicts a certain body part, which is known as the site of disease manifesta\u00ad tion. Treatment entails correction of all the steps in the process resulting in dis\u00ad ease manifestation, thus restoring the en\u00ad tire person to his or her particular bal\u00ad anced state. Therapeutics In Ayurveda, restoring a person to health is not viewed simply as the eradi\u00ad cation of disease. It entails a complete process of diagnosis and therapeutics that takes into account both mental and physi\u00ad cal components integrated with the social and physical worlds in which the patient lives. Ayurvedic diagnosis , examination of the disease, and types of therapeutics are briefly explained below. Ayurvedic diagnosis Ayurveda established a detailed system of diagnosis , involving examination of pulse, urine, and physical features. After a preliminary examination by means of visual observation, touch, and interroga\u00ad tion, the Ayurvedic physician undertakes an eightfold method of detailed examina\u00ad tion to determine the patient's type of physical constitution and mental status and to get an indication of any abnorma\u00ad lity. Pulse examination Pulse examination is first mentioned in a medical treatise from the late 13th or early 14th century of the Common Era. It is a highly specialized art. Not every Ay\u00ad urvedic physician uses pulse examination. The diagnostic process involves evenly placing the index, middle, and ring fin\u00ad gers of the right hand on the radial artery of the right hand of men and the left hand of women, just at the base of the thumb. 338 INDIAN J TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE , VOL 2, No.4, OCTOBER 2003 A pulse resembling the movement of a snake at the index finger indicates a pre\u00ad dominance of Vata; a pulse resembling the movement of a frog at the middle fin\u00ad ger indicates a predominance of Pitta; a pulse resembling the movement of a swan or peacock at the ring finger indicates a predomin ance of Kapha; and a pulse re\u00ad sembling the movement of a woodpecker indicates a predominance of all three doshas. To get an accurate reading, the physician must keep in mind the times when each of the doshas are normally excited, and should take the pulse at least three times early in the morning when the stomach is empty, or three hours after eating in the afternoon, making sure to wash his or her hands after each reading. Urine examination Urine examination probably was for\u00ad malized in the syncretic phase. After col\u00ad lecting the morning's midstream evacua\u00ad tion in a clear glass container, the physi\u00ad cian submits the urine to two kinds of examination after sunrise. First, he stud\u00ad ies it in the container to determine its color and degree of transparency . Pale\u00ad yellow and unctuous urine indicates Vata; intense yellow, reddish, or blue urine in\u00ad dicates Pitta; white, foamy, and muddy urine indicates Kapha; urine with a blackish tinge indicates a combination of doshas; and urine resembling limejuice or vinegar indicates Ama. The physician also puts a few drops of sesame oil in the urine and examines it in sunlight. The shape, movement, and diffusion of the oil in the urine indicate the prognosis of the disease. The shape of the drops also re\u00ad veals which dosha(s) is involved. Snake-like shape indicates Vata; umbrella shape Pitta; and pearl shape, Kapha. Examination of bodily parts The physician concludes his diagnostic examination with careful scrutiny of the tongue, skin, nails, and physical features to determine which dosha(s) is affected. Using the basic characteristics of each of the doshas, he examines different parts of the body. Coldness, dryness, roughness, and cracking indicate Vata; hotness and redness indicate Pitta; and wetness, whiteness, and coldness indicate Kapha. Having completed this phase of the diag\u00ad nosis, the Ayurvedic physician proceeds to examine any malady present. Examination of disease A detailed examination of the disease involves a five-step process, leading to a complete understanding of the abnormal\u00ad ity. Etiology A disease results from one or several of the following factors: Mental imbal\u00ad ances resulting from the effects of past actions (karma); unbalanced contact be\u00ad tween the senses and the objects of the senses affecting the body and the mind; effects of the seasons on the mental and doshic balance and the immediate causes of diet, regimen, and microorganisms; doshas, Ama and the combination of in\u00ad teraction of individual components such as doshas and tissues, or doshas and mi\u00ad croorganisms . Early signs and symptoms Early signs and symptoms that appear before the onset of disease provide clues SAKARKAR eta/: ESSENCE OF AYURVEDA: THE TRADITIONAL MEDICAL SCIENCE 339 to the diagnosis. Proper diet and admini\u00ad stration of medicine can avert disease if it is recognized early enough. Manifestation of signs and symptoms The most crucial step in the diagnostic process is manifestation of signs and symptoms. It involves determining the site of origin and of manifestation, and of the path of transportation of the Ama and dosha(s). Most signs and symptoms are associated with the site of disease mani\u00ad festation, from which the physician must work his way back to the site of the origin of disease to effect a complete cure. Al\u00ad though symptomatic treatment was largely absent in traditional Ayurveda, modern medicine in India has introduced Ayurved ic physicians to techniques ol' symptomatic treatment in cases of acute disease. Pathogenesis Pathogenesi s is a six-step process that determines the manner by which a dosha becomes aggravated and moves through different channels to produce disease. An accumulation of a dosha leads to its ag\u00ad gravation, which causes it to spread through the channels until it lodges in a particular organ of the body, bringing about a manifestation of disease. Once a general form of the disease appears, it progressively splits into speci lie varieties . As in systems of medicine the world over, many patients consult the Ayurvedic phy\u00ad sician only after the disease appears. Ay\u00ad urveda delineates seven basic varieties of diseases, based on the doshas: diseases involving a single dosha; diseases in\u00ad volving two doshas; and diseases involv-ing all three doshas together. Prognosis is the final step in the Ayurvedic diagnostic process. Since Ayurvedic physicians tra\u00ad ditionally did not treat persons with in\u00ad curable diseases, it was important for the physician to know precisely the patient's chances of full recovery. Therefore, dis\u00ad ease is one of three types. lt is easily cur\u00ad able, palliative, or incurable or difficult to cure. In general, if the disease type (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha) is different from the person's normal physical constitution, the disease is easy to cure. If the disease and constitution are the same, the disease is difficult to cure. If the disease, constitu\u00ad tion, and season correspond to doshic type, the disease is nearly impossible to cure. Having determined the patient's normal constitu tion, diagnosed his illness, and established his prognosis for recov\u00ad ery, the Ayurvedic physician can begin a proper course of treatment. Ayurvedic treatment Ayurveda recognizes two courses of treatment, based on the condition of the patient. The first is prophylaxis, for the healthy person who wants to maintain a normal condition based on his or her physical constitution, and to prevent dis\u00ad ease. The second is therapy, for an ill per\u00ad son who requires health to be restored. Once healthy, Ayurveda recommends continuous prophylaxis based on diet, regimen, medicines , and regular thera\u00ad peutic purification procedure s. When a person is diagnosed with a doshic imbal\u00ad ance either purification therapy, allevia\u00ad tion therapy, or a combination of these is prescribed . 340 INDIAN J TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE, VOL 2, No.4, OCTOBER 2003 Purification therapy Purification therapy involves the fun\u00ad damental Panchakarma, or Five-Action Yoga treatment. The fivefold process varies slightly in different traditions and regions of India, but a standard regimen generally is followed. All five procedures can be performed , or a specific procedure can be chosen, based on different factors such as the physical constitution of the patient, his or her condition, the season, and the nature of the disease. Before any action is taken, the patient is given oil internally and externally (with massage), and is sweated to loosen and soften the dosha(s) and Ama. An appropriate diet of food and drink is prescribed. Following this twofold preparatory treatment, called Purvakarma, the five therapies are ad\u00ad ministered in sequence over the period of about a week. Because of the profound effects on the mind and body, the patient is advised to set aside time for treatment. (I) First the patient might be given an emetic, and he vomits until bilious matter is produced thus removing Kapha. (2) Second, a purgative is given until mucus material appears, thus re\u00ad moving Pitta. (3) Third, an enema, either of oil or de\u00ad cocted medicines, is administered to remove excess Vata. (4) Fourth, head purgation is given in the form of smoke inhalation or na\u00ad sal drops to eradicate the dosha(s) that have accumulated in the head and sinuses. (5) Fifth, leeches may be used and bloodletting performed to purify the blood. Some physician s do not con-sider bloodletting in the five thera\u00ad pies of Panchakarma, instead count\u00ad ing oily and dry (decocted medicine) enemas as two separate forms. Alleviation therapy Alleviation therapy uses the basic con\u00ad diments honey, butter or ghee, and ses\u00ad ame oil or castor oil to eliminate Kapha, Pitta, and Vata, respectively. This therapy and Panchakarma often are used in con\u00ad junction with one another. Oleation therapy (Snehana) Oleation therapy involves application of unctuous (oily) substances both inter\u00ad nally and externally on the body as a pal\u00ad liative program before Panchakanna and as a general maintenance of the body. This is the first therapy to be adminis\u00ad tered before Panchakarma therapy. It con\u00ad stitutes the best remedy for alleviating the Vata dosha. Sources of fats and oils Animal sources -Fish, fat and bone marrow of four-footed animals. Curd, milk, oil, ghee, meat, fat and bone marrow of four-footed animals and birds are administered as unctuous sub\u00ad Charaka Samhita, ght e is best for oleation therapy. When mixed with other herbs, it does not give up its own propertie s and has capabilit y to transform itself to inborn qualities of the substance added to it. Propertie s of some fatty substances are given in Table l.

It also gives strength to the bones Sarat (Autumn) Seasonal indication for oleation One should not take extremely hot or cold unctuous substances. Ghee should be taken in autumn because Pitta increases in this season and ghee is antidote for Pitta dosha. Oil alleviates Kapha and Vata due to its hotness. Muscle fat is neither too hot nor too cold so it is recommended in the months of April and May. In this pe\u00ad riod the bodily strength and clhatus are in diminishi ng process. So muscle fat can be used to enhance strength and the dha\u00ad tus. Time for administration of fats If there is vitiation of Vata and Pitta dosha and in summer, then fats should be administered in the evening. If there is vitiation of Kapha dosha and in winter, then fats should be administered in mid\u00ad day. :\\nupana Ghee with warm water Oil with yusha (vegetable soup) Muscle fat and bone marrow with gruel All of them can be taken with warm water also. Indication for the administration of ghee When Vata and Pitta dominate bodily constitution. When suffering from diseases clue to imbalance of Vata and Pitta. Indication for the administration of oil When it is used in winter for those having Kapha and medas (fat) in excess. In conditions arising due to vitiation of Vata. Indications for the administration of muscle fat When Kapha and medas (fat) are be\u00ad low normal. Who are emaciated and weak due to hard and excessive work. Pharmaceutics Ayurveda possesses a rich store of natural medicines that have been col\u00ad lected, tested, and recorded in medical treatises from ancient times. The tradition of collecting and preserving information about medicines in recipe-books called Nighantus continues to the present day. The most tradition al sources of Ayurve\u00ad dic medicine are the kitchen. It is likely 342 INDIAN 1 TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE . VOL 2, No.4. OCTOBER 2003 that, at an early stage of its development, Indian medical and culinary traditions worked hand-in-hand with each other. Because of the close association between food and medicine, Ayurveda classifies foods and drugs (usually vegetable) by the taste, potency, and taste after diges\u00ad tion. Rasa, taste by the tongue, is catego\u00ad rized into six separate tastes, with their individual elemental composition and doshic effect as follows. I. Sweet, composed of earth and water, increases Kapha and decreases Pitta and Vata. 2. Sour, composed of earth and fire, increases Kapha and Pitta and de\u00ad creases Vata. 3. Saline, composed Kapha and Pitta and de\u00ad creases Vata. 4. Pungent, composed of wind fire, increases Pitta and Vata and de\u00ad creases Kapha. 5. Bitter, composed of wind and space, increases Vata and decreases Pitta and Kapha. 6. Astringent, composed of wind and earth, increases Vata and decreases Pitta and Kapha. Virya, potency comprises eight types that pairs: hot and dull\u00ad sharp. Vipaka, post-digestive taste, identifies three kinds of after-taste: sweet, sour, and pungent. Contrary foods and drugs are to be avoided always. For instance, clarified butter and honey should not be taken in equal quantities; alkalies and salt must not be taken for a long period of time; milk and fish should not be consumed together; and honey should not be put in hot drinks. Four important criteria are considered when compounding plant substances and other ingredients into medical recipes. The substances that make up the recipe should have many attrib\u00ad utes that enable it to cure several diseases ; they should be usable in many pharmaceutical preparations; they should be suitable for the recipe and not cause unwanted side effects and they should be culturally appro\u00ad priate to the patients and their cus\u00ad toms. Every medicine should be able to treat the disease's site of origin; site of manifestation, and it's spread, simultaneously . A brief survey of the different kinds of medical prepara\u00ad tions indicates the depth and content of Ayurvedic pharmaceuticals. The botanicals-based medicines derive largely from the Ayurvedic medical tradition, while the mineral and inor\u00ad ganic-based drugs derive from the Indian Alchemical traditions, called Rasashastra. Some important prepa\u00ad rations are as follows. I. Juices are cold-presses and extrac\u00ad tions made from plants. 2. Powders are prepared from parts of plants that have been dried in the shade, and other dried ingredients. 3. Infusions are parts of plants and herbs that have been steeped in water and strained. 4. Cold infusions are parts of plants and herbs that were soaked in >Vater overnight and filtered the next morning. 5. Decoctions are vegetable products SAKARKAR et al: ESSENCE OF AYURYEDA: THE TRADITIONAL MEDICAL SCIENCE 343 boiled in a quantity of water propor\u00ad tionate to the hardness of the plant part and then reduced by a fourth. It is then filtered and often used with butter, honey, or oi Is. 6. Medicated pastes and oi Is. Often the plant and herbal extracts are com\u00ad bined with other ingredient s and formed into pastes, plasters, and oils. Used externally, pastes and plasters are applied for joint, muscular, and skin conditions, and oil is used for hair and head problems . Medicated oils also are used for massages and enemas. 7. Plant and herbal extracts are also formed into pills and suppositories to be used internally. 8. Alcoholic preparations, viz. Asawa, Aristha and Kadha are made by fer\u00ad mentation or distillation. Two prepa\u00ad rations are delineated: One requires the drug to be boiled before it is fer\u00ad mented or distilled, and in the other, the drug is simply added to the preparation. Alcohol content in a drug is allowed up to fifteen percent. Several Ayurvedic medicines are prepared from minerals and metals, and are derived ultimately from an\u00ad cient traditions . 9. Sublimates . These are prepared by an elaborate method leading to the sublimation of sulfur in a glass con\u00ad tainer. They are found in recipes (Rasayanas) used in rejuvenation therapies . I 0. Bhasmas are ash residues produced from the calcination of metals, gems, plants, and animal products . Most are metals and minerals that are first detoxified and then purified. An im\u00ad portant bhasma is prepared from mercury, which undergoes an 18- stage detoxification and purification process. Ayurveda maintains that bhasmas are quickly absorbed in the blood and increase the red blood cells. 11. Pishtis are fine powders made by triturating of gems with juices and extracts. 12. Collyrium is made from antimony powder, lead oxide, or the soot from lamps burned with castor oil. Co\u00ad llyrium is used especially to improve VISIOn. Space does not allow a discussion of the individual plants used in Ayurvedic recipes. However, out of hundreds of plants mentioned in various Ayurvedic treatises, most Ayurvedic physicians commonly employ only a small portion. Ayurvedic clinical approach An example of a specific disease will illustrate the traditional Ayurvedic clini\u00ad cal approach. In Sanskrit terminology, the Amavata refers approximately to arthritic and rheumatic conditions . Amavata As the word itself indicates, Amavata involves Ama and the dosha Vata (wind). Traditional Ayurveda does not distinguish types of arthritis. This disease is caused by all factors that lead to the formation of Ama: unwholesome foods and regimens, bad digestive power, insufficient exercise, and excessive intake of unctuous foods and meat. The site of origin is principally the colon, but the entire alimentary canal 344 INDIAN J TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE, VOL 2, No.4, OCTOBER 2003 is involved . Contrary foods and mental disturbance aggravate Vata and lead to the formation of Ama in the colon. Ama, propelled by Yata, leaves the site of ori\u00ad gin and affects the enzymes, causing Ama to form at every level. Ama then becomes lodged in the joints and the heart, the sites of manifestation . The path of transport is the Rasavaha srotas, the vessels trans\u00ad porting chyle, lymph, and plasma. Yata is the principal dosha affected. With the aggravation of Vata, symptoms include severe pain in the joints, rough skin, dis\u00ad tension of stomach, and indigestion. If Pitta is involved , a burning sensation spreads all over the body, especially in the joints. If Kapha is involved , the pa\u00ad tient gradually becomes crippled. Little pain is experienced in the early morning because Ama is just beginning to move. The Ayurvedic treatment of Amavata in\u00ad volves actions, medicines, and procedures to reduce Ama and alleviate Yata. The first course of action is to put the patient on a mild fast and to administer medi\u00ad cines that have a bitter taste, hot potency, and pungent post-digestive taste, all of which help to reestablish the digestive powers. Sweating might be recommended to aid the digestive process. The second step of the treatment involves the purifi\u00ad cation therapy of Panchakarm a. The two preparatory actions, oleation and sweat\u00ad ing, are administered first to dislodge and soften the Ama. The remaining five pro\u00ad cedures are performed over a period of a week, during which time the patient maintain s a strict diet. These will eradi\u00ad cate the dislodged Ama from the system, and restore the balance of the doshas, es\u00ad pecially Vata. One of two types of enema is used, depending upon the amount of Ama present. If Ama persists, an enema with decoctions is administered until Ama is removed when an oily enema is given. After the Panchakarma therapy, the patient should assume a regimen that includes avoiding sleep during the day and after meals, as well as heavy food that hinders digestion. Effective treatment of arthritic conditions, especially in chil\u00ad dren, has included wet massage therapy in conjunction with the enemas of Pan\u00ad chakarma. The affected areas are patted with a cloth bag filled with rice that has been cooked with milk and herbs. Mas\u00ad sages with oils also are routinely pre\u00ad scribed.
