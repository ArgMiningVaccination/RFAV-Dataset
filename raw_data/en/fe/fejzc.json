As Singapore extends its [Stabilisation Phase](https://www.tatlerasia.com/culture/travel/dining-in-to-resume-from-june-21-phase-3-heightened-alert-singapore) and all restriction to November 21, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine will be included in Singapore's national vaccination programme as a three-dose regime.

Currently, both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech are very similar. They both use the new messenger RNA technology which injects parts of the virus's genetic material into the body. This then teaches cells to create a protein that will trigger an immune response. This will allow your body to produce antibodies to fight the virus. The reported side effects of both vaccines are also very similar with people typically reporting pain or swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle aches, fever, chills, nausea and joint pains. Don't miss: [Comirnaty: What You Need To Know About Singapore's New Covid-19 Vaccine](https://sg.asiatatler.com/society/comirnaty-covid-19-vaccine-singapore) Both vaccines also have similar efficacy rates with Moderna's being at 94 per cent and Pfizer's at 95 per cent. The only difference between the two vaccine types is that Moderna requires two doses taken at least four weeks apart while Pfizer requires two doses taken at least three weeks apart. Additionally, Singapore received a new batch of vaccines, called [Comirnaty](https://sg.asiatatler.com/society/comirnaty-covid-19-vaccine-singapore). These vaccines are the same as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that are now used in the national vaccination programme and will be reflected as Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty in your HealthHub records if you get it. SINOVAC Sinovac, on the other hand, is the latest vaccine to be included in Singapore's national vaccination programme. Currently, there are 24 private clinics islandwide that have been selected to administer it. A single dose will cost you between $10 to $25 and you will need three doses.

There should not be any additional costs (beyond the vaccination administration fees listed) charged by these providers,\" MOH said. People who suffer from allergic reactions following their first Pfizer or Moderna jabs are encouraged to take Sinovac to complete their vaccine regime, according to Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary in Parliament on Aug 2. If you have already taken one dose of Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty though and would like to switch to Sinovac-CoronaVac, you will be required to take two more doses of Sinovac-CoronaVac as it is of relatively lower vaccine efficacy. If you are medically ineligible to take any mRNA vaccine, you should also be taking three doses of Sinovac-CoronaVac. You can find out more about how many doses you should be taking [here](https://www.gov.sg/article/sinovac-coronavac-included-in-the-national-vaccination-programme). If you are interested in the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine, you can contact the providers directly from June 18 to get more information.
