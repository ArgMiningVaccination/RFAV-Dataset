The [first study](https://t.emailupdates.cdc.gov/r/?id=h33c9ebfb%2C128dca44%2C128dcd91&ACSTrackingID=USCDC_1052-DM41940&ACSTrackingLabel=COCA%20Now%3A%20Two%20MMWR%20Updates%3A%20Pregnant%20Women%20and%20COVID-19&s=qgT1_1Ook7SyEd8U23Q-vhjRQ2kQo7UhFXUm0Xql-6w) found that pregnant women with COVID-19 are at increased risk for severe illness, compared with non-pregnant women with COVID-19. Markers for severe illness included admission to an intensive care unit, receipt of invasive ventilation, receipt of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (or ECMO, an advanced life support technique used for patients with life-threatening heart and/or lung problems), and death. Although the absolute risks of severe illness are low overall, pregnant women are at increased risk compared with nonpregnant women with COVID-19, and risk of severe outcomes were highest among women in the oldest age group (ages 35 - 44). Hispanic or Black women were found to be disproportionately affected by COVID-19 during pregnancy. The [second study](https://t.emailupdates.cdc.gov/r/?id=h33c9ebfb%2C128dca44%2C128dcd92&ACSTrackingID=USCDC_1052-DM41940&ACSTrackingLabel=COCA%20Now%3A%20Two%20MMWR%20Updates%3A%20Pregnant%20Women%20and%20COVID-19&s=blx3YHs5LY8NgNQ42CbIHFCvqBBDjP9k_h3cB-opw2E) found that pregnant women with COVID-19 may be at increased risk of having a preterm infant (born before 37 weeks), which may lead to serious health problems for the infant. CDC recommends that healthcare providers counsel pregnant people to: - Continue to follow key prevention measures to reduce their risk of becoming ill, including limiting unnecessary interactions with persons who might have been exposed to or are infected with COVID-19 as much as possible, wearing a mask in public and when around others, avoiding activities where social distance is difficult to maintain, and washing their hands. - Continue to attend healthcare appointments during and after pregnancy. - Obtain all recommended vaccines. - Know the symptoms of COVID-19 illness. - Get emergency care immediately if they need it.
