The anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects of the dietary supplement have made CBD an ideal addition to any wellness regimen. At Ideal Health, we've recently begun incorporating CBD into our treatments for patients who are interested in experiencing the enhance effects. Let's talk about how chiropractic and CBD work together to relieve pain. What Is CBD? Cannabis plants are made up of more than 400 different compounds. More than 60 of these compounds are specific to cannabis, while the rest are also found in many other species of plants. Cannabidiol, or CBD, is one of these unique compounds that offer a variety of medicinal and therapeutic effects. It is important to note that THC is another compound found in cannabis. This is the compound that creates the high commonly associated with marijuana use. Marijuana that does not include THC is not marijuana at all. It is called hemp. Cannabidiol can be derived from hemp plants or marijuana. The legal status of marijuana in your state dictates where the CBD comes from. Because both medical and recreational marijuana is legal in the state of Colorado, you can find CBD that comes from both marijuana and hemp plants with differing levels of THC. If you're looking for a CBD product, be sure to do your research and find the best option for you. How Can CBD Enhance The Effects Of Chiropractic Medicine? Chiropractic medicine is well established as an alternative method of pain relief. In the wake of the opioid epidemic that is taking over the United States, many providers of alternative medicine have sought out ways to increase the effectiveness of their practices in order to benefit their patients and prevent further growth of the reliance on pain medication. CBD is one of the ways we are doing this. The endocannabinoid system is a network of neurotransmitters and receptors that play a role in the functioning of the central and peripheral nervous system. The endocannabinoid is responsible for regulating nearly every vital system in the body, including pain perception, stress responses, learning, memory, muscle movement, circulation, and more. CBD acts as a supplement for the endocannabinoid system and alleviated deficiencies to restore order and balance. The chemical structure of CBD is similar to the body's naturally-occurring cannabinoids, such as anandamide and 2-AG. The similarities allow them to be used to mimic the endocannabinoid system. There are a couple of ways to combine chiropractic and CBD. You can use topical applications during a treatment and/or dietary applications in between treatments to maximize the effects of both chiropractic and CBD. Any method of CBD supplementation can support your chiropractic treatments. Interested In Trying CBD And Chiropractic? CBD is a safe, non-toxic, dietary supplement that can be used with little to no negative side effects. Not only that, but it is also completely legal. If you suffer from chronic pain, arthritis, muscle soreness, or see a chiropractor to help with any other symptoms, CBD could be the answer to enhancing your pain relief efforts.
