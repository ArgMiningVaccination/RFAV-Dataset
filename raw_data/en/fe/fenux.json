Annual Notification of Stud ent Rights under FERPA The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974, as amended, affords students certain rights with respect to their own education records. These rights include the following: 1. The right to inspect and review student e ducation records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access. Students should submit to the Office of the Registrar written requests that identify the record(s) they 3 - August 30, 2023 wish to inspect. The registrar will make arrangements for acces s within 45 days from the date of such request, and will notify the students of the time and place where the records may be inspected. The University reserves the right to deny a copy of a student education record (including, without limitation, a transcri pt) for which a financial hold exists (a hold is imposed if the student fails to pay bills, fees, or fines owed to the University). A hold will not interfere with the right t o visually examine student education records. Questions about the University's pol icies and practices relating to the Act should be addressed to the Office of the Registrar. 2. The right to request an amendment of student education records that students believe are inaccurate or misleading. Students should write the University registra r, clearly identify the part of the records they want changed, and specify why the records are inaccurate or misleading. If the University decides not to amend the records as requested, it will notify the students of the decision and advise the students of their right to a hearing. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the students when they are notified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in student education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to appropriate parties in connection with a health or safety emergency. Another excepti on that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official com mittee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review a studen t education record in order to fulfi ll his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the University may disclose student education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll if the disclosure is for purposes related to the stu dent's enrollment or transfer. Education records may be compelled and disclosed without consent by, or notice to, the student pursuant to a valid subpoena issued under the USA Patriot Act. Finally, personally identifiable \"directory information\" may be rel eased freely unless the student files the appropriate form requesting that such information not be released. This form is available at the Office of the Registrar.

LESSARD Fall 2023 Dear Student, Welcome to the 2023 -2024 academic year. At Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (MCPHS), you are part of an incredible Community that is committed to nurturing and supporting you. I invite you to engage with our faculty and staff as well as your peers to shape an exciting and rewarding educational journey. This is a remarkable moment to be at MCPHS. We are celebrating our Bicentennial, building on our rich histor y as we bring to life a strategic plan that will carry us into the future. In 1823, our founders set out to improve the quality of medicines for the public by developing standard practices and training for apothecaries. They could picture a better future f or patients. Our institution evolved over the next 200 years as Community members from many different backgrounds identified new opportunities to serve patients and society. But one thing remained constant: We have always nurtured healthcare and life sc ience visionaries. We are committed to helping our students meet their personal and professional goals. And we are proud that our graduates are building a healthier world. As you plan your year, I encourage you to explore the full range of opportunitie s at MCPHS. Our dedicated faculty members look forward to engaging with you through the standard curriculum. But I challenge you to think beyond degree requirements. For example, consider taking full advantage of the unique environment at MCPHS by atten ding interprofessional events and having conversations with students outside of your program. Our focus on the health and life sciences translates into campuses brimming with individuals pursuing various paths to serve patients and promote health. Dialogue across disciplines will position you well for a career in team -based healthcare. We also offer experiential learning that builds on the standard curriculum. Hone your skills in settings that will give you a chance to interact with patients or professionals in your future line of work. For example, we have collaborations with life scien ces companies that can open the door to an internship. Consider connecting with faculty to use our cutting -edge labs. Many students pursue research projects while at MCPHS. Keep in mind that our faculty and staff are here for you. Lean on faculty adviso rs, academic coaches, counselors, and other team members for support. Whatever your goals, we can help set you up for success. We are grateful to our students \u2014from more than 50 U.S. states and territories and 90 countries \u2014for making this such a vibrant place to learn and grow. The world needs new ideas and change -makers to address pressing challenges in healthcare and life sciences. We need you. Sincerely, Richard J.

Eligibility for Financial Aid To be eligible for federal studen t aid, the student must be a citizen, permanent resident, or other eligible noncitizen of the United States; registered with the Selective Service System or exempt from registration; not in default on any federal student loan or owing a refund on any federal grant; not convicted of any federal or state drug offense while receiving federal student aid; and in good academic standing. *For the 2023/24 award year Selective Servi ce and Drug requirements no longer require resolution. By completing the application instructions previously outlined, students are automatically considered for all possible funding opportunities, including those offered by the federal government, the state (if eligible), and the University. Please keep in mind that students who meet the March 15 financial aid application deadline are given priority consideration for all available funds, which are limited by allocations and budgets. Degree Stan ding A student's standing as an undergraduate or graduate student is an important factor in the financial aid application and award process. The FAFSA asks students to identify whether they are in an undergraduate or graduate/professional program. These questions should be answered based on the following criteria: Undergraduate Students Students in the following programs are considered undergraduate students for financial aid purposes: Chemistry Dental Hygiene Diagnostic Medical Sonography Global Healthcare Management Healthcare Management Health Psychology Health Sciences Magnetic Resonance Imaging Medical and Molecular Biology Nuclear Medicine Technology Nursing Pharmaceutical Business Pharmaceutical Sciences Pharmacology/Toxicology PharmD -Boston campus: Years I -IV Premedical Health Studies 66 - August 30, 2023 Public Health Radiation Therapy Radiography Bachelor of Pre -Dental -Dental Hygiene Bachelor of Science in Health Care Management Postbaccalaureate Bachelor of Science in Nursing Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences, Acupuncture Pathway Graduate Students Students in the following programs are considered graduate/professional students for financial aid purposes: Master of Health Sciences Master of Physician Assistant Studies (Boston and Manchester/Worcester) Master of Public Health Master of Regulatory Affairs and Health Policy Doctor of Acupuncture Doctor of Acupuncture & Integrative Health Doctor of Health Sciences Doctor of Healthcare Administration Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) -Boston campus: Years V and VI Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) -Worcester/Manchester campuses: all years (unless advised by Student Financial Services) Doctor of Optometry Doctor of Physical Thera py Master of Science in Dental Hygiene Master of Science in Nursing Master of Science / PhD in Medicinal Chemistry Master of Science / PhD in Pharmaceutical Economics and Policy Master of Science / PhD in Pharmaceutics Master of Science / PhD in Pharmacology Master of Science in Clinical Research Master of Science in Occupational Therapy Master of Acupuncture Master of Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine Master of Business Administration in Healthcare Management Master of Science in Clinical Management Master of Science in Personalized Medicine Doctor of Science in Personalized Medicine Doctor of Science in Physician Assistant Studies Students whose program is not listed here should contact the Office of the Registrar for assistance in identifying their degree standing.

AS to Master of Science in Dental Hygie ne Bridge Program Online: Year 1 is classified as undergraduate, and full time status is a minimum of 12 credit hours; subsequent years are classified as graduate and full status is a minimum of 9 credit hours. For all baccalaureate degree programs, students are classified as undergraduates, and full -time status is a minimum of 12 credit hours. For all masters, MS, other doctoral, and PhD programs, full -time status is a minimum of 9 credit hours. 67 - August 30, 2023 Dependency Status For the 2023 -2024 school year (July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024), the U.S. Department of Education considers the following students to be independent of their parent(s) for purposes of awarding federal financial aid: Students who were born before January 1, 2000 Stude nts who are orphans or wards of the court, or were wards of the court at any point during or after age 13 Students who are veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces Students who have children, if they provide more than half of the support for the child Students who have dependents (other than a child or spouse) living with them, if they provide more than half of the support for the dependent Students who are married Students who will be graduate/professional students in 2023 -2024 (see Degree Standing to determine who is considered a graduate/professional student for financial aid purposes) Students who are serving in the U.S. Armed Forces or are National Guard or Reserves enlistees for purposes other than state or training Students who are or we re emancipated minors as determined by a court Students who are or were in a legal guardianship on the date the student became an adult, as determined by a court Students who are or were considered an unaccompanied youth who was homeless on or after July 1, 2021 As the criteria above indicate, financial independence is not one of the criteria used in determining whether a student is considered dependent or independent. Parental data must be provided on the FAFSA for students who are unable to answer \"yes\" to any of the listed criteria. The University uses the U.S. Department of Education definition of dependency status for all federal, state, institutional, and private financial aid programs. Students should refer to the FAFSA for specific details on each of the above criteria or contact the Office of Student Financial Services for assistance in determining status. Prior Bachelor's Degree Students w ho are in possession of a baccalaureate degree prior to their enrollment at the University are not eligible for certain grant programs, including the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, and state scholarship/grant progra ms. Massachusetts Residency Massachusetts residency is defined as having resided in Massachusetts for purposes other than attending college for at least one year prior to the beginning of the academic year. (The beginning of the academic year is defined as July 1 by the Commonwealth.) Parents of dependent students also must have resided in Massachusetts for at least one year prior to the beginning of the academic year. Programs funded by the Commonwealth are limited to undergraduate students without a prior bachelor's degree. Yellow Ribbon Program for Veterans MCPHS University participates in the Yellow Ribbon Program. Only Veterans entitled to the maximum benefit rate, as determined by service requi rements, or their designated transferees may receive this funding. Details on eligibility can be found, here: https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/yellow_ribbon.asp . In order to receive a full acceptance of a Yellow Ribbon Scholarship, students must submit t heir Certificate of Eligibility for Post -9/11 GI Bill\u00ae* from the VA to the University. For additional details or questions regarding eligibility, please email: sfs@mcphs.edu . *GI Bill\u00ae is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Af fairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill . Enrollment Status Financial aid awards are based on full -time attendance at the Unive rsity. Full -time attendance, during the fall semester and the spring semester, is defined as a minimum of 12 credits for undergraduate students and 9 credits for graduate students (see Degree Standing to determine graduate/professional student status for f inancial aid purposes). Enrollment is reviewed for all students receiving financial aid at the end of the official add/drop period each semester, at which time adjustments to financial aid awards are made. The following aid programs require full -time enrollment. Less than full -time enrollment will result in complete loss of the award: Massachusetts State Funds Health Professions Loan Nursing Student Loan Most other state grants 68 - August 30, 2023 The following programs are prorated based on enrollment status. For these programs, undergraduate students will receive a portion of the awarded amount if the student enrolls less than full -time for a given semester: Federal Pell Grant MCPHS Need -Based Awards MCPHS Merit -Based Awards The following programs require at least half -time enrollment. Less than half -time enrollment will result in complete loss of the award. Half -time enrollment is defined as 6 credits for undergraduate students and 4.5 credits for graduate students: Federa l Stafford Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) Federal PLUS loan Many alternative/private loans Graduate Students Graduate students who want to apply for assistantships, scholarships, and fellowships should contact the Associate Dean for Graduat e Studies. International Applicants Financial aid in the form of grants and loans are generally not available to international students. Students may qualify for a Private Educational Loan with a credit worthy U.S. Citizen Co -signer. Satisfactory Academic Progress The University is required to establish minimum standards of satisfactory academic progress (SAP) for students receiving financial aid. The University applies these standards to all federal, state, and institutional funds. The Office of Student Financial Services will disburse financial aid only to those students who are in good academic standing and are making satisfactory progress toward completion of their degree. Requirements A student is not making satisfactory academic progress if any of the following conditions exist: The student's cumulative grade point average (GPA) is below 2.0 at the end of the second year of their academic program. Grade point averages are reviewed b y the Academic Standing Committee at the end of each semester. The student's earned credits (completed with a passing grade) are less than 67% of all attempted credits (coursework), as calculated at the end of each semester. The student has exceeded the maximum time frame of attempted credits (150%) of the published length of their degree program. Satisfactory academic progress is reviewed at the end of each semester (payment period). The following describes how types of coursework are used in the SAP calculation: Dropped coursework is not included. Failing grades (F) are included in the GPA and in earned and attempted credits. Withdrawals are included in earned and attempted credits. Repeated coursework is included in the G PA and in earned and attempted credits. Pass/fail coursework is included in earned and attempted credits. Audit coursework is not included. Colleges of the Fenway (COF) coursework is included in the GPA and in earned and attempted credits. Transfer coursework (applicable to current program) is included in earned and attempted credits. Satisfactory/unsatisfactory coursework (graduate programs only) is included in earned and attempted credits. Remedial coursework is not included. If a student is not making satisfactory academic progress, they will be placed on financial aid warning. A student then has one semester to make satisfactory progress. If, after one semester on financial aid warning, a student is not making satisfactory ac ademic progress, the student becomes ineligible for aid and will be notified by email. Students who are ineligible for financial aid because they are not making satisfactory academic progress may appeal to regain eligibility for the subsequent seme ster to achieve the SAP standards. Students may also continue to take coursework without the use of financial assistance until eligibility is reinstated by achieving the required SAP standards, subject to the approval of the university and the student's ac ademic department. 69 - August 30, 2023 Appeals are considered when a student can demonstrate that an extraordinary circumstance existed (for example, student illness, the illness or death of a family member) that prevented the student from achieving satisfactory academic progress. Students considering an SAP appeal should contact the Office of Student Financial Services to make an appointment to discuss the situation. Appeals are due by the posted deadline in the email notification of academic status and loss of aid eligibility; however, an appeal does not exclude the student's payment responsibility associated with the semester's bill due date. Incomplete appeals will not be reviewed. Students with an approved appeal will be placed on financial aid pr obation and have one semester to achieve satisfactory academic progress. If the student fails to achieve the SAP standards after probation, then they will not be eligible for aid until the standards are achieved. If MCPHS determines, based on the appeal, t he student will require more than one academic semester to meet progress standards, the University may grant a subsequent appeal; if an academic plan is developed for the student, the student must successfully complete the program in the specified time. St udents will be reviewed at the end of one academic semester to determine if they are meeting the requirements of the plan. If the student is meeting the requirement of the academic plan, the student is eligible to receive Title IV funds as long as the stu dent continues to meet those requirements, and is reviewed according to the requirements detailed in the plan. Non-matriculating students are not eligible for financial aid. Process for Awarding Financial Aid In selecting financial aid recipients , primary emphasis is placed upon financial need, availability of funds, the student's academic achievement, and/or satisfactory academic progress. Determining Need To determine a student's need, the University uses the Free Application for Feder al Student Aid (FAFSA). The information provided on the FAFSA is used to determine what amount a family can be expected to contribute toward the cost of attending the University (the expected family contribution, or EFC). The University uses the st andard federal formula (known as the federal methodology, or FM) in computing the expected parental and student contributions. Some of the factors used in the analysis include income, assets, family size, and number of family members in college. The studen t's expected contribution is added to the parental expected contribution to produce the total expected family contribution. The student's financial need is determined by subtracting the expected family contribution from the total cost of attending the Univ ersity. The cost of attendance includes tuition and fees as well as an allowance for room and board, books and supplies, travel, federal loan fees, and other education - related expenses. The Financial Aid Package After the student's financial nee d is determined, Student Financial Services will develop a financial aid package for the student. MCPHS utilizes scholarships, loans, and employment opportunities to assist students in meeting as much of their demonstrated financial need as possible. The U niversity makes every effort to distribute the available funds in an equitable fashion in order to assist the greatest number of eligible students. The total amount of aid a student receives may not exceed his or her total cost of attendance. The Un iversity offers a variety of scholarships, which are funded through endowments, gifts, and other monies raised by the University. Scholarships are awarded primarily based on academic achievement and financial need. Students applying for financial aid are a utomatically considered for each scholarship for which they may qualify. Major programs providing financial aid to students are described in the 2023 -2024 MCPHS Student Financial Services handbook. Merit Aid University Merit Aid is determined at the time of admission. Students are required to maintain a 2.5 cumulative GPA in order to continue receiving their merit award. Students who fail to meet the 2.5 GPA requirements will have one semester to improve their GPA to a 2.5 cumulative or the merit award will be cancelled and cannot be reinstated. Private Funding Sources In addition to the federal, state, and University programs offered through the University's financial aid application process, students also are encouraged to apply for out side aid to help meet the costs of education. Several free scholarship search services are available through the Internet (please visit the University's website at www.mcphs.edu for further information). In addition, most high school and public libraries h ave resources detailing private scholarship opportunities. Verification Process Each year the federal government and/or MCPHS selects students who have completed the FAFSA for verification. The verification process simply requires the University to review supporting documents to verify the information reported on the FAFSA for the par ent(s), student, and spouse. 70 - August 30, 2023 Information that may be verified includes adjusted gross income, federal taxes paid, education credits, the number of individuals in the household, the number of individuals in the household who are enrolled at least ha lf time in college, high school completion status, identity / statement of educational purpose, and other information deemed necessary for review. If you are selected for verification, you will be notified via email of additional documents that you must submit to complete your financial aid file. The IRS Data Retrieval Tool allows students and parents to access the IRS tax return information needed to complete the FAFSA. Students and parents may transfer the data directly into their FAFSA if certain criteria are met. MCPHS encourages all students and families to utilize the IRS data retrieval process, which is the preferred method for FAFSA filers to report federal tax information. If the IRS data retrieval process is not used on a FA FSA transaction, then the student and/or parent may need to obtain federal tax return transcripts from the IRS. Students and/or parents may complete online requests for a federal tax return transcript at www.irs.gov . Online requests are considered the qui ckest approach to obtain a federal tax return transcript. The request may take up to 10 days to fulfill. MCPHS will not disburse federal, state, and institutional financial aid to a student's account until the student completes the verification proc ess. Failure to complete the verification process will result in cancellation of federal financial aid. The University reserves the right to verify any file that appears to contain discrepant information. In addition to verifying a student's application da ta, MCPHS is required by federal law to resolve any conflicts of information that become evident as part of the application review process. All discrepancies must be resolved prior to disbursement of Title IV aid to a student's account. Additional S tudent Financial Services Appeal Process Students and parents may appeal their financial aid award if there is a significant and unforeseen change in circumstances or if there is information that was not provided on the original application materi als. For additional details regarding the financial aid appeal process, refer to the 2023 -2024 MCPHS Student Financial Services handbook. All appeals must be in writing and must include documentation of the reasons for requesting the reevaluation of the financial aid package as well as complete tax transcripts and W -2s (if necessary) for the student and parent (if the student is a dependent). Applying Financial Aid to Your Student Account If all necessary paperwork has been submitted by the studen t, financial aid will be applied to a student's account after add/drop and after attendance has been verified by the Registrar's office each semester. Failure to submit the necessary paperwork will result in the delay and possible cancellation of the stude nt's financial aid. Refunds Students will automatically receive a refund for any excess funds (credit balance) on their student account each semester. Refunds are available as soon as administratively possible following verification of student enrollment and disbursement of financial aid funds. Students should be sure to make arrangements each semester for the purchase of books and payment of rent (if housed off campus), since refunds are not available during the first few weeks of each academic term. It is highly recommended for ease in refund processing that students sign up for direct deposit though Self-Service (https://live -red.mcphs.edu/Student/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fStudent%2f ). Late Payment Fees Students with outsta nding student account balances will be charged a late payment fee. To avoid late payment fees, students must ensure that all financial obligations (including tuition, fees, health insurance fees, and housing charges) will be met by the dates specified in t he Tuition section of this catalog. Account Placement Fee An Account Placement Fee will be applied to any student's account not paid by the scheduled due date and placed with Heartland/ECSI for assistance with the collection efforts on the outs tanding balance. This fee is in addition to the Late Payment Fee and cannot be waived. Students receiving financial aid and/or private alternative loans must ensure that proper documentation is completed and aid and/or loan funds are received by th e University on or before the payment due date in order to avoid a late fee. 71 - August 30, 2023 Students participating in a payment plan must ensure that the payment plan budget for each term will cover all outstanding charges. Payment plan budgets that will not result in a paid -in-full status by the end of the payment term will be assessed a late payment fee. For students with outstanding balances, the University reserves the right to refuse to release official transcripts, to release the diploma certifying graduation, to complete board examination certification, or to register the student for any other coursework to access campus wide systems such as Blackboard, WebAdvisor and Uni versity E -mail to view final grades Students wishing to appeal late payment fees are required to do the following: Pay the student account balance due in full (less the late payment fee). Submit the following in writing to the Office of S tudent Financial Services: Student name Student ID number The reason(s) or documentation that contributed to the circumstances of the late payment fee The student will be notified of the decision concerning the appeal of a late payment fee. Student Account Statements Student account statements are sent electronically on a monthly basis to students with a balance due. Statements include all recent account activity, including charges, payments, disbursements of financial aid and loan funds, and account adjustments. Balances due must be paid by the payment due date to avoid late payment fees. Students have the ability to view real -time charges and updates through the Student Account Center as well as grant shared access to their account . The University accepts electronic funds transfer, MasterCard, Discover, Visa, and American Express payments via the Student Account Center. Credit and Debit card payments are subject to a service fee equal to 2.85% of the payment amount (minimum $1.00 fee) . The service fee will be charged and retained by the online payment provider. Service fee percentage is current as of May 30, 2023 and is subject to change. Alternative methods of payment include wire transfers and check payments. Work-Study Students working in a Federal Work -Study Program position are paid through a weekly paycheck based on hours actually worked. These funds are not credited to the student's account. Withdrawal and Approved Leave of Absence from the University Stude nts withdrawing or taking a leave of absence from the University who have been determined to be eligible for federal financial aid are subject to certain provisions surrounding the calculation of their federal aid eligibility. A feder ally determined formul a is used to calculate the amount of federal aid a student is eligible to receive based on the portion of the semester completed before the withdrawal. If a student received more assistance than was earned, the unearned funds must be returned to the Depart ment of Education. The amount of aid a student is eligible to receive is based on the percentage of the semester that was completed prior to the initiation of the withdrawal process. For example, if 40% of the semester has passed when the withdrawal process is initiated, then 40% of the federal aid originally scheduled for disbursement has been earned. Once more than 60% of the semester has been completed, a student is considered to have earned 100% of the federal aid they were eligible to receive. If it is determined that a student received more federal aid than was earned, MCPHS will return the unearned funds based on a formula comparing institutional charges with the unearned percentage of funds. If MCPHS must return a portion of the funds, the removal of those funds from the student's account will create a balance due, which the student will be required to pay. To find out how a withdrawal during the first 60% of the semester may affect a financial aid award, students should make an a ppointment to discuss the situation with their Student Financial Services representative. For additional information, please review the University Withdrawal, Leave of Absence and Refund under the Tuition, Room and Board, Fees section of the catalog . 72 - August 30, 2023 Veterans' Affairs (VA) Currently enrolled or accepted students with Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits must submit a copy of their VA Certificate of Eligibility (COE) to the Registrar's Office via e -mail, fax, or mail. The Registrar's Office may require additional information to pr operly certify enrollment. Students must complete a Veterans Affairs Request form to request that their certification of enrollment be submitted to the VA. The form must be completed each semester a student is enrolled, no later than 60 days prior to the start of the semester. The request form and additional support resources provided by the University Educations Team (UVET) are available online at https://www.mcphs.edu/academics/registrar/veterans -affairs . The UVET is comprised of faculty and staff mem bers that contribute to the university's overall mission of support and advocacy for our student veterans and other military - associated students. Prior Credit MCPHS University maintains written records of previous education and training of the veteran or eligible person and indicates appropriate credit has been given for previous education and training. Students Receiving Veterans Benefits under 38 U.S.C. Ch. 31 and 38 U.S.C. Ch. 33 MCPHS University will permit any covered individual to attend or participate in the course of education during the period beginning on the date on which the individual provides to the educational institution a certificate of eligibility for entitlement to educational assistance under chapter 31 or 33 (a \"certificate of eligibility\" can also include a \"Statement of Benefits\" obtained from the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) website - eBenefits, or a VAF 28 -1905 form for chapter 31 authorization purposes) and ending on the earlier of the following dates: The date on which payment from VA is made to the institution. 90 days after the date the institution certified tuition and fees following the receipt of the certi ficate of eligibility. MCPHS University will not impose any penalty, including, the assessment of late fees, the denial of access to classes, libraries, or other institutional facilities, or the requirement that a covered individual borrow additional funds, on any covered indivi dual because of the individual's inability to meet his or her financial obligations to the institution due to the delayed disbursement funding from VA under chapter 31 or 33. Delayed VA Payments Under S2248 PL 115 -407 Section 103, MCPHS Universi ty will not impose a late fee, denial of access to facilities, or other penalty against a veteran or eligible dependent due to a late payment of tuition and/or fees from the VA up to the certified benefits amount. Any portion of the student bill not cover ed by VA benefits is still expected to be settled by the due date. Students are responsible for all charges and fees not covered by the veteran or other eligible beneficiary's VA educational benefits (for example, housing, meal plans, or beneficiary is less than 100% eligible). 73 - August 30, 2023 ACADEMIC POLICIES General University policies and procedures are stated below. Students should note that within individual programs and schools there might be additional requirements or variations of these po licies. The ultimate responsibility for complying with academic policies and fulfilling graduation requirements rests with the individual student. Calendar, Enrollment, and Attendance Academic Calendar The academic calendar is a live document available at https://www.mcphs.edu/academics/academic -calendar. Students are required to review details of the calendar during the web check -in process at the start of each semester. Changes to the published academic calendar are communicated to students v ia an email sent from the Registrar. Enrollment Registration for Classes Prior to the start of preregistration for each term, the Registrar's Office will notify students (via MCPHS email) of the registration schedule. The email will indicate if students will be block registered for required courses or if students need to meet with an Academic Advisor before registering for classes. Students who register on time receive an electronic bill from Student Financial Services. Students who miss the registration period are charged a late registration fee. Students who have outstanding balances are not allowed to register or attend classes until all bills are paid in full. Double Majors (Boston) Students enrolled in selected BS degree programs (Boston) may declare a double major. Accelerated, degree completion, online, MPAS, Nursing, PharmD, Premedical Health Studies, and Health Sciences programs cannot be used in double majors. In addition, a double major in Public Health and Health Psychology is not available. St udents who declare a double major cannot complete a minor. In order to be eligible for a double major, the student must have a grade point average (GPA) of 3.2 or higher and have completed at least 30 credits. Once students have been approved for a double major, they are required to maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0 for the remainder of their studies. Students should note that only one degree will be conferred. Due to scheduling conflicts and/or additional course requirements, students may need to take more than 18 credits per semester and/or enroll in summer semester(s) in order to graduate with their class. In cases where courses overlap between majors, general elective credit may need to apply to one of the courses. It is recommended that students check wi th Student Financial Services to discuss how the additional course requirements might affect their financial aid status. In order to be considered for a double major, candidates should contact their Academic Coach in the Center for Academic Success and Enr ichment (Boston) and complete the Application for Double Major form, which requires approval of relevant program directors and deans. Minors (Boston) Students who wish to pursue a minor must complete a Declaration of Minor form, which is available in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment. The Declaration of Minor form must be forwarded to (1) the student, (2) the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment, and (3) the Office of the Registrar. Requirements for completion of some minors vary for st udents in the Premedical Health Studies program. These variations are outlined in the Bachelor of Science in Premedical Health Studies section of this catalog. Nonmatriculating Students Students that have not been formally granted admission to an MCPHS academic program may take credit -bearing courses at either the undergraduate or graduate level as a non -matriculated student in the School of Professional Studies. Students may take course s for professional or personal development, to satisfy prerequisite requirements for entry to a degree program, or to transfer credits to another institution. Students must meet all prerequisites to enroll in a course. Course credits earned as a non -matriculated student do not automatically apply toward a degree program at MCPHS University. Students later admitted to an MCPHS academic program may request their non -matriculated coursework be transferred with approval of the appropriate program director or academic dean. In order for coursework to be transferred 74 - August 30, 2023 it must meet one of the following: Undergraduate degree program students may transfer a maximum of four undergraduate courses not to exceed 14 credits for courses in which students earned a C or better. Masters level degree program students may transfer a maximum of two graduate courses not to exceed 8 credits for courses in which students earned a B or better. Doctoral level degree program students may transfer a maximum of three graduate cour ses not to exceed 12 credits for courses in which students earned a B or better. In rare instances, exceptions may be granted for students completing prerequisite requirements with approval of the appropriate program director or academic dean. Visiting Students (Boston) Visiting students (those enrolled in degree programs at institutions other than members of the Colleges of the Fenway) also may register for classes at the University. Such students must provide documentation of good academic standing from their home institution before completing their registration. Visiting students may register on a seat -available basis and only after the designated period when matriculated students have completed the registration process. Such students may obtain regis tration materials at the Office of the Registrar. This same policy also applies to students from other MCPHS campuses. In the case of nonmatriculated and visiting students, it is expected that such students will adhere to the academic requirements as set forth by the instructor(s) and stated in the course syllabus. Visiting Classes A person may visit a class in which they are not officially enrolled only with prior consent of the instructor. Leave of Absence The University recognizes that there are sit uations when a student may require a leave of absence (LOA). Such leaves are granted for a maximum of one academic year with the exception of leaves granted for military service. The student must meet to consult with their Academic Dean or designee regardi ng the reason(s) for considering, and the ramifications of, taking a leave of absence. After the initial meeting with the Academic Dean or designee, the student must return the completed Leave of Absence form within 1 week (or 5 business days) with the req uired signatures: a) the student, b) Academic Dean or designee, c) Student Financial Services, and d) Immigration Services representative (for international students). The Academic Dean or designee will notify the student within 1 week (or 5 business days) upon receipt of the completed form with the finalized LOA requirements via the student's MCPHS email account. Students who take a leave after the designated add/drop period will receive course grade(s) of W. *For information on a Health/Medical Leave of A bsence, please see the Health/Medical Leave of Absence section in this catalog. Return from Leave of Absence Students returning from a leave of absence must confirm they are returning to MCPHS University with their Academic Dean or designee prior to the following dates: March 1 -for a summer or fall semester return October 1 -for a spring semester return Online students -30 days prior to the beginning of the semester Students on a Leave of Absence are not eligible for University Services, with the exce ption of academic coaching. Students who intend to return from a LOA must also review and adhere to applicable school/program specific policies in addition to the general policy outlined herein. Students who fail to return within the designated time must reapply for admission. Attendance The University expects students to meet attendance requirements in all courses in order to qualify for credit. Attendance requirements may vary depending on the instructor, and these should be clearly stated in the sylla bus available to each student during the first week of the course. Generally, students are expected to attend all classes unless they have a valid excuse. (See Documented Student Absence Request Policy and Procedure). The Documented/Emergency Absence Policy is intended for students who experience an unforeseen circumstance. The Documented/Emergency Absence Policy is not intended to be used as the standard attendance policy in a course syllabus. 75 - August 30, 2023 Faculty should refer st udents to the Documented/Emergency Absence Policy for absences that fall under the scope of the Policy. It is not intended for every absence. Faculty who are already working with a student on their absences do not need further approval from the Dean of Stu dents. Faculty are notified of an approved absence within 5 -7 business days to the faculty member's MCPHS email account. Lists of absences throughout the duration of the semester are not provided. If faculty have questions about the Documented/Emergency Absence Policy or questions about the approval process, they can contact the Dean of Students/Student Affairs Office on their home campus. Documented/Emergency Absence Policy Absences from coursework can be detrimental to students' academic progress. In an effort to support students in certain circumstances, a Documented/Emergency Absence may be granted as a reasonable allowance; however, a Documented/Emergency Absence does not always excuse a student from making up academic work nor does it guarantee that missed work/clinical hours can be made up. Admission to Classes No student will be admitted to a scheduled class unless the student's name is on the instructor's class roste r, and the student's account is in order. Student Conduct / Community Standards An instructor shall have the right to require a student who is disruptive during a class, laboratory, or experiential rotatio n to leave for the remainder of the session and sh all report the incident to the Student Affairs office on their campus for further appropriate action in accordance with the Student Code of Conduct. Public Safety may also be notified. Instructional Periods Faculty members are expected not to continue any class beyond the scheduled ending time. Unless students have been informed that the faculty member will be late, class is canceled if a faculty member has not arrived within 10 minutes of the scheduled starting time of a class. Online and Distance Educa tion The majority of courses at MCPHS are conducted in physical classrooms and labs. However, in addition to programs offered entirely online or in an executive or hybrid format, some required and elective courses may be delivered online and/or through di stance education. In participating in online or distance education courses, students learn in different ways and must manage a technologically mediated environment. This learning will be of value both in the completion of degree requirements and in the wor kplace. Increasingly, workplaces utilize technology for training and work. Minimum Class Size By noon on the Friday of the first week of classes, the school dean will make the following decision regarding offering a class, based on enrollment: Required courses will be offered unless offered more than once in a calendar year. If five or fewer students register for a required course that is offered more than once in a calendar year, the course may be canceled (programmatic requirements considered). Elective courses will be offered provided there is a minimum of eight students enrolled. Registration It is the responsibility of the instructor to ensure that only properly registered students are allowed to attend class. If a student's name does not appear on the class roster in Self -Service after the add/drop period, that student shall not be allowed to attend, participate in, or take or receive exams until the instructor is notified by the Office of the Registrar t hat the stu dent is officially registered. 76 - August 30, 2023 Course Policies Academic Honesty (See Academic Honesty Policy under University Policies section of the University Catalog) . Credit Hour Policy The credit hour policy applies to all courses at all levels (graduate, professional and undergraduate) that award academic credit regardless of the mode of delivery including, but not limited to, self -paced, online, hybrid, lecture, research, clinical and laboratory. Academic units are responsible for ensuring that credit hours are awarded only for work that meets the requirements outlined in this policy . A lecture period of 50 minutes per week or laboratory work of 110 to 220 minutes per week, extending over one semester, co nstitutes one academic credit hour. For each hour of lecture, students are expected to spend a minimum of two hours outside of class preparing for the course. For research, clinical/experiential rotations and service -learning activities, actual hours may vary by program, but such activities must include an amount of work that is at least equivalent to lecture and laboratory courses. Assessment All materials, in whatever format, submitted by students for evaluation in MCPHS courses may be used by MCPHS fo r program or institutional assessment. To the extent possible, individual identification will be removed from these materials before they are used for assessment purposes. Instructor Absence If a faculty member is unable to conduct classes as scheduled, e very effort will be made to offer substitute instruction for the students. Planned absences due to professional commitments should be approved by the school dean well in advance so that suitable coverage or alternative assignments may be arranged. The scho ol dean should be informed as soon as possible of any unplanned absences due to illness or personal emergency so that students can be notified in a timely manner. Classes can be canceled only with the approval of the school dean or, in the absence of the s chool dean, the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Colleges of the Fenway A Colleges of the Fenway (COF) student enrolled in an MCPHS course through COF cross -registration must notify the course instructor and provide them with an email address to ensure that course information is received in a timely manner. The student also should consult with the instructor regarding access to online applications that might be used in the course. Disabilities and Accommodations Students with documented disabilit ies who wish to request accommodations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) should contact the Office of Student Access and Accommodations at 617.879.5995 and/or OSAA@mcphs.edu to discuss the accommodati ons process. Writing-Intensive Courses (for all HUM courses and others designated as writing intensive) The MCPHS faculty believes that learning in all disciplines is an integrative process, a synthesis of critical reading, thinking, and writing. Students not only must learn to write but also must write to learn. Consequently, writing -intensive courses requi re students to write 15 to 20 pages in two or more assignments that may take various forms as determined by the course instructor. In addition, instructors dedicate class time to the teaching of writing in their specific disciplin es, provide feedback on as signments, and allow revision of at least one assignment. Writing Proficiency Requirement (Boston only) MCPHS -Boston students in all baccalaureate and first professional degree programs are expected to meet the University's standards for writing proficie ncy, which include the general standards for writing competency as delineated in the University's writing proficiency rubric, and specific applications of those standards by faculty in disciplines across the University curricula. Students who do not perfo rm at a satisfactory level of writing proficiency may be referred to the Writing Center and may be required to demonstrate writing improvement to receive full course credit. (For details, see the Writing Proficiency Requirement \u2014Boston section of this catal og.) The writing proficiency rubric is available on the Writing Center Web page at https://my.mcphs.edu. Transfer Policy (Boston) MCPHS does not award transfer credit for remedial or developmental skills courses or other courses that are taught at levels below the first -year level at MCPHS. This includes English courses on sentence and paragraph structure or similar 77 - August 30, 2023 content courses below the level of LIB 111 (Expository Writing I), mathematics courses in arithmetic or algebra if below the level of MAT 141 (Algebra and Trigonometry), and biology and chemistry courses below the level of the MCPHS first-year courses required for the program to which the student seeks entrance. Transfer courses will not be accepted as fulfillment of the core curriculum requir ements in the liberal arts distribution areas if they are taught in the first year of a University curriculum. Liberal arts courses acceptable for transfer credit mu st have prerequisite requirements and must be taken during the student's second or subseque nt year in a University curriculum. Transfer Credits Post Matriculation Once a student has matriculated at the University, no courses taken outside of MCPHS will be accepted for transfer credit. (NOTE: COF courses are allowed for Boston students.) Excepti ons to this policy may be granted in instances involving delay of graduation or extreme hardship. Prior to taking a course for transfer credit at another institution, students must submit a Petition to Transfer Credit form to the Center for Academic Succ ess and Enrichment, which approves or denies the petition. Notification of the decision will be distributed to (1) the student, (2) the program director, (3) the school dean, (4) the Office of the Registrar, and ( 5) others as appropriate. The student is responsible for requesting that official transcripts be sent to the Office of the Registrar, which will verify the credit and post a grade of TR in the student's transcript. Official transcripts must be received no later than the add/drop deadli ne of the subsequent semester. These petitions are reviewed on a case -by-case basis and may take up to two weeks to receive official notification. Students are advised not to enroll in or make payments for non -MCPHS courses without official University appr oval. Minimum Transfer Grade The minimum grade for receiving transfer credit is C (2.0). This may vary for some academic programs, please check the good academic standing chart under the Academic Standing section for minimum grade requirements. Studio Art and Performance Courses (Boston) A maximum of one studio art or performance course may be taken for credit at another institution, including the Colleges of the Fenway. Studio art courses may be accepted for general elective credit only, not for liberal arts distribution credit. Credit by Examination Credit by examination is available to students whose previous coursework in a subject area does not meet transfer credit criteria or who feel they have achieved competency in a subject through work or life experience. Credit by examination is available to new students only during the student's first semester of matriculation at the University, no later than the add/drop deadline of the term of entry. Competency may be demonstrated through one of the following means: (1) College Level Examination Program (CLEP), (2) Advanced Placement (AP) examination, or (3) International Baccalaureate (IB) examination. The College Board administers CLEP and AP examinations. A passing score on the CLEP examination in English Composition with Essay will be accepted as credit for Expository Writing I. A passing score on the CLEP examination in Freshman College Composition with Essay will be accepted as credit for Expository Writing II. CLEP credit will be awarded only after the Admission Office has received official scores directly from the College Board. In the case of AP examinations, credit will be awarded for a score of 4.0 or higher. No AP credit will be awarded for CHE 131 Chemical Principles I, CHE 132 Chemical Principles II, CHE 110 Basic Chemistry I, or CHE 210 Basic Chemistry II. No AP credit will be awarded to students in the Premedical Health Studies program for BIO 151 Biology I or BIO 152 Biology II. AP and IB exceptions: Chemistry AP scores of 4 or bett er will be accepted as transfer credit for CHE 131 and CHE 132 for students who matriculate at MCPHS with existing college credit for organic chemistry. Transfer students accepted into the professional phase of an MCPHS degree program will receive transfer credit for IB courses accepted by a previous college. In both of these instances, official AP and/or IB exam documentation must be provided to MCPHS no later than the add/drop deadline of the term of entry. Students who complete IB courses must provide h igh school transcripts and/or IB reports that document the course, examination level, and exam score. Students must achieve a score of 5 or better on an HL (high -level) IB exam. Transfer credits are limited to exams for English, language, or the arts. 78 - August 30, 2023 Students are responsible for scheduling CLEP/AP examinations through the College Board. Results/scores of the examination(s) should be sent (by the school dean if applicable) to the Admission Office. If the student achieves an acceptable score on the examinat ion(s), then notification will be sent to (1) the student, (2) the program director, (3) the school dean, (4) the Office of the Registrar, (5) the Academic Advising Center / advisor, and (6) others as appropriate. Credit earned by examination will not be c ounted toward the residency requirement . Clinical Rotations and Background Screenings For some MCPHS programs, placements in clinical rotations at healthcare providers are a required part of the MCPHS curriculum. Some of those healthcare providers require background screenings, and a conviction for a criminal offense might present an issue. It is possible that certain types of criminal convictions, whether prior to being a student at MCPHS or while attending MCPHS, could preclude a student from being able to complete a required clinical rotation. For more information, please contact the MCPHS Chief Compliance Officer. Cross-Registration (Boston) Cross -registration provides full -time undergraduates of the Colleges of the Fenway with the op portunity to take up to two courses per semester (fall and spring semesters) at any of the five Colleges of the Fenway institutions at no additional charge, so long as the credit load does not exceed 18 credit hours. This opportunity provides students with the advantages of a small college but exposes them to resources similar to those of a large university. Cross -registration enables students to broaden their intellectual and social capacities, and it introduces them to faculty, research, colleagues, and c urricula they would not otherwise have experienced. Courses are open to cross -registration on a seat -available basis. Each school's home students have the first option to register for courses that have been developed through joint efforts of faculty acro ss the schools, and the goal of these courses is to attract a mix of students. A searchable database of all courses open for cross -registration may be found at www.colleges -fenway.org. Detailed information about cross -registration and associated processes and policies is highlighted on the Colleges of the Fenway website (www.colleges -fenway.org). Dean's List The dean's list recognizes full -time students seeking a bachelor's degree or Doctor of Pharmacy who have completed the required full -time credit hours of credit and earn a minimum 3.50 semester GPA. Courses that are taken pass/fail do not count toward the full -time status. Doctor of Pharmacy students in Boston, Worcester, and Manchester who are completing clinical rotations are not eligible for the dean 's list. Doctor of Pharmacy students in the Worcester and Manchester programs during the six -week fall semester of Year II are eligible for the dean's list. Incomplete grades that remain beyond the first three weeks of the subsequent semester render a stud ent ineligible for the dean's list in that term. Dean's list is not awarded to students in graduate programs (i.e., MPAS, MANP, MSN, MSDH, MS, DPT, OD, and PhD). The dean's list is published approximately one month into the following semester by the Regist rar's Office. Add/Drop Procedures Any registered student who wishes to adjust his or her class schedule during the designated add/drop period can make adjustments online via Self -Service, with the exception of students in the School of Professional Studie s who can make such adjustments by emailing professionalstudies@mcphs.edu. Students cross -registered for Colleges of the Fenway courses must adhere to the add/drop procedures at their home institution. The add/drop period deadline for all programs is speci fied for each academic term, usually within the first week of classes. Adjustments to tuition and fees, where applicable, are made automatically through the Office of Student Financial Services. Students who wish to withdraw from a course after the designa ted add/drop period should refer to the Withdrawal from a Course section in Academic Policies and Procedures. No refunds are made if such changes are made after the designated add/drop period. NOTE: Simply failing to attend classes will not result in the c ourse being dropped from the student's official registration, and students will be held financially accountable and receive a course grade of F. Email Policy All MCPHS students are required to open, utilize, and maintain an MCPHS email account. Official University communications and notices are sent via MCPHS email accounts only. All students are responsible for regularly checking their MCPHS email and for the information contained therein. Only MCPHS accounts will be used in all matters related to academics, student life, and University notifications. The University does not forward MCPHS email to personal email accounts. All MCPHS community members can regis ter in the MCPHS Emergency Notification System to receive text messages via cell phones and email regarding major campus emergencies and campus closings. Contact helpdesk@mcphs.edu for more information. Examinations All tests and examinations, other than final examinations, are scheduled by the instructor. Students who miss a scheduled 79 - August 30, 2023 examination (i.e., classroom examination, lab, or other graded performance) and are granted a documented absence for the missed examination (see Documented Student Absence R equest Policy and Procedure) must arrange a make -up exam with the course instructor. The format of the make -up exam may vary from that of the original scheduled exam and is at the discretion of the course instructor. With respect to completion of such exam inations, if an acceptable agreement between the student and professor(s) cannot be reached, the school dean will serve as arbitrator. During the fall and spring semesters for undergraduate and first professional degree students, no course examinations (worth 15% or more of the final course grade) may be scheduled during the week before final examinations. Major written assignments may be due the week before finals if the assignments were semester -long and not assigned within the last four weeks of the se mester. Exceptions are granted for laboratory examinations, including practical examinations. Exceptions also may be granted for block -scheduled courses, subject to approval by the Vice President for Academic Affairs (see School of Nursing). NOTE: Final examinations are scheduled by the Office of the Registrar several weeks before the end of the semester. Final examinations must be given only during final exam week. The final exam schedule includes make -up times for examinations canceled due to incl ement weather or other unforeseen circumstances (e.g., power outages, fire alarms). Students and faculty are expected to take these dates into account when planning any travel (i.e., they should not purchase nonrefundable tickets to leave before the make -up date). Posting Examination Grades Faculty do not use student identification numbers to post exam grades. Quiz, exam, and assignment grades are posted on BlackboardTM via the use of student -specific log -ons and confidential passwords. Please remember tha t passwords should be kept confidential. Final Grades Students may view their final grades online. Final grades are not available to students until all grades have been submitted by all faculty. The Registrar's Office will notify students via email when all grades are posted each term. 80 - August 30, 2023 Grading Grading System GRADE QUALITY POINTS EXPLANATION A 4.0 A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 C- 1.7 D 1.0 F 0.0 S N/A Satisfactory U 0.0 Unsatisfactory AUD N/A Audit; students cannot audit courses that are part of their curriculum HP N/A High Pass (excellent performance in clinical courses only) I N/A Incomplete NC N/A No Credit P N/A Pass PC N/A Pass Credit TR N/A Student received transfer credit W N/A Withdrawal from course * N/A An asterisk denotes removal of grade from GPA NOTATION EXPLANATION C Clinical /internship/clerkship/rotation H Honors course L Lab O Online course ST Selected topics course T Travel course Grading Policies Grade Appeals A student who wishes to appeal a final grade of a course must do so within two weeks of the grade being posted by the Registrar's Office. The first appeal should be in writing to the instructor, who must make a decision to uphold or change the grade within 3 business days of the appeal. The written appeal should contain the rationale for the appeal. If a mutually acceptable agreement cannot be reached (or the instructor does not respond within 3 business days), the student has 3 business days to appeal in writing to the administrator in charge of the academic unit offering the course 81 - August 30, 2023 (Department Chair, Program Director or designee). The appeal should contain the rationale for the appeal and the result of the appeal to the instructor. The academic unit adm inistrator must decide to uphold or change the grade within 3 business days of the appeal. If this procedure does not successfully resolve the matter (or if the administrator does not rule on the matter in 3 business days), the student has 3 business days to appeal in writing to the chief administrator (School Dean or designee) overseeing the academic unit offering the course. The appeal should contain the rationale for the appeal and the results of the appeals to the instructor and the academic unit admin istrator. The chief administrator will uphold or change the grade and inform the student within three business days. The decision of the chief administrator is final. Decisions on grade appeals are based solely on objective grade information. If the grad e appeal affects a student's progression status, the grade appeal process must be completed on or before the first day of class/clinical rotation, prior to the start of the next semester. It is the student's responsibility to init iate the grade appeal. Grade Point Average (GPA) The total number of quality points (see Grading System section of this catalog), divided by the total number of credit hours taken, yields the grade point average. The grade point average for each semester and cumulatively is calcul ated to two decimal points. In some degree programs, a professional grade point average also is calculated for each student by dividing the number of professional quality points by the total number of professional credit hours taken. Grade Reports At the end of each academic term, students can view their grades online via Self -Service. The Office of the Registrar notifies students when grades are posted. Incomplete Grades Courses with a grade of Incomplete must be completed within three weeks of the new semester following the academic term (including summer sessions) in which the Incomplete grade was assigned, or the grade automatically becomes an F. The instructor is respo nsible for notifying the Office of the Registrar regarding any student who has been granted additional time for coursework completion. The instructor also must specify the extended time period, up to one semester. No student may progress to courses for whi ch the course with an Incomplete is a prerequisite until the work is completed and the I grade is changed. Incomplete grades render a student ineligible for the dean's list. No student can graduate with an Incomplete grade in any course necessary for gradu ation. Auditing Courses \u2014No Credit (Boston) A student may audit a course with the consent of the instructor. The student must register for the course through the Office of the Registrar prior to the add/drop deadline and pay two -thirds of the tuition. The student does not earn academic credit for audited courses. Students cannot audit courses that are part of their required curriculum. Pass/Fail Courses A maximum of one elective course may be taken on a pass/fail basis at another institution, including the Colleges of the Fenway. A grade of P or F will appear on the MCPHS transcript for any course taken pass/fail. A pass grade (P) will not affect a studen t's grade point average. Repeated Courses Following completion of a course repeated at MCPHS, the earlier grade will be removed from the grade point average, and the more recent grade will be used in the calculation. Both grades remain on the transcript for future reference. If the student repeats a course outside the University (see Courses Taken at Other Colleges after Matriculation), the lower grade is dropped from the grade point average, but a substitute grade is not used in the calculation. Such cou rses are listed as transfer credit. Courses may be attempted no more than two times. Grades of F and W are considered attempts for courses in which D or better is the passing grade. For those courses in which the passing grade is higher (e.g., C -, C), gr ades below the passing grade and W are all considered attempts. Failure to complete any course within these limits will result in dismissal from the degree program or major. When a curriculum change results in a course moving from one category to another (e.g., from preprofessional to professional), and a student repeats the course in the new category, the GPA will automatically be calculated in the new category. If the student wants the GPA to be calculated in the previous category, they must state the j ustification for that request via a petition for special academic request. The request is not automatically approved, and the repeated course will not be counted in both professional and preprofessional categories. 82 - August 30, 2023 Grade Replacement The Registrar will automatically replace the previous grade when a student repeats a course. Students are encouraged to review their current program evaluation with the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment to determine if there are existing grades that s hould be replaced. The timely replacement of grades is essential in determining the academic standing of students. Recalculation of the Grade Point Average Students who wish to remove courses from their grade point average that are not required for the ne w program should note their request on the Change of Program form. All grades will remain on the transcript (and program evaluation), with the notation that they are not included in the grade point average. These requests must be approved by the new academ ic dean. Students who leave a program not in good academic standing and wish to move to another degree program or be readmitted to their former program must meet the grade point requirements of that YOG and program (see Good Academic Standing). Students w ho leave the PharmD program not in good standing must complete the new program and meet the grade point average requirement required by the School of Pharmacy -Boston before seeking readmission into the PharmD program. An additional change of program may r esult in courses being added back to the GPA. MCPHS Transcripts Copies of official transcripts must be requested in writing and bear the signature of the requesting student. Current students may request transcripts online via Self -Service. Transcripts are furnished to designated institutions or authorized agencies only when the student submits a completed transcript authorization form. Transcripts are issued to those students whose financial status with Student Financial Services is clear. 83 - August 30, 2023 Academic Standing The academic standing of each student will be reviewed at the end of each academic semester at each campus, including summer sessions. All students will be reviewed by the school in which they are enrolled. Summer sessions are reviewed to evaluate student academic progress. Each school has specific academic progress standards (e.g., minimum grade point average requirements, minimum grades for required courses) that must be met in order to progress within the degree program (see Good Acad emic Standing). Students who fail to meet the minimum standards required for academic progress will be notified of the decision by the school's Academic Standing Committee (ASC). Good Academic Standing To be in good academic standing, a student's cumulat ive and professional grade point averages (if applicable) must meet the minimums required by the degree program in which they are enrolled. Any student whose cumulative or professional average falls below the minimum after an academic term is considered to be on probation. Professional grade point averages are calculated only after 12 credits have been taken in professional courses (exceptions exist for the Nursing program). Cumulative or professional grade point average minimums are listed in the Good Acad emic Standing table in this section. Students who fail to meet the minimum standards required for academic progression will be notified of the decisions by the school's Academic Standing Committee. In order to maintain good academic standing, students s hould be aware that the professional curricula of the University are rigorous and demanding. Students who must be engaged in gainful employment should balance school and work responsibilities so as not to compromise their academic success. Academic Warning At multiple points during each semester, faculty members submit academic warnings via Self -Service, which are processed by the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) on each campus. Students who receive academic warnings will be notified by their academic departments/programs by email to their official MCPHS emails and provided additional instructions. Boston: Each student placed on academic warning will be encouraged to attend academic skill -building workshops and to meet w ith their Academic Coach in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment. These actions may be required of students who receive more than one academic warning (as stipulated in a letter from their school dean). Worcester/Manchester: Each student place d on academic warning will be required (as stipulated in his or her notification letter) to meet with an Academic Counselor in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (Worcester/Manchester) and meet with a faculty advisor. There is no appeal process associated with an academic warning. 84 - August 30, 2023 Academic Actions Academic Probation Each student's academic status will be reviewed at the end of each academic semester by the Academic Standing Committee (ASC) for their school, and each student's professional (if applicable) and cumulative grade point averages (GPAs) will be determined. A student with a professional and/or cumulative GPA below the requirement for his or her major shall be placed on academic probation and receive a letter from their Academic Dean or Program Director. This written notice of probationary status also will incl ude a notice that failure to reach the required GPA by the end of the designated academic semester may result in dismissal from the University. Each student on probation is required to meet with a designated member of the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) on their home campus by the end of the second week of the probationary semester to develop and agree to \u2014in writing \u2014an Academic Success Plan (ASP). The ASP may include mandatory study/advising sessions, mandatory class attendance, or other stipulations aimed at encouraging and supporting student success. Probationary status may remain in effect for up to two consecutive academic terms, defined as two semesters or two clinical clerkships/rotations, depending upon the student's year and/or c ampus of enrollment. It is expected that students on probation make progress toward good academic standing at the conclusion of each academic term. Failure to demonstrate improvement at the end of the first probationary period may result in dismissal. At t he conclusion of the second consecutive academic term, the student must have achieved good academic standing; failure to do so may result in dismissal. Upon completion of each academic term, a student on academic probation will receive a notice of his or h er current standing in writing from the school dean. Individual programs may have specific grade point requirements that students must meet in order to enter the professional years and associated clerkships/rotations of their programs. These program -speci fic requirements preempt the probation process for the preprofessional years. For information about program -specific requirements for the professional years, students should contact the appropriate school dean and refer to the Good Academic Standing chart. There is no appeals process associated with academic probation. Academic Dismissal Each student's academic status will be reviewed at the end of each academic semester by the appropriate Academic Standing Committee (ASC). Each student's professional (if applicable) and cumulative GPAs will be determined. If a student's GPA falls below the level of good academic standing, as defined by the program requirements, for two consecutive academic semesters, the ASC will submit a recommendation for dismissal from the program to the appropriate school dean. Courses may be attempted no more than two times. Grades of F and W are considered attempts for courses in which D or better is the passing grade. For those courses in which the passing grade is higher (e.g., C -, C), grades below the passing grade and W are all considered attempts. Failure to complete any course within these limits will result in an ASC recommendation for dismissal from the degree program to the school dean. Individual programs may have specifi c grade point requirements that students must meet in order to enter the professional years and associated clerkships/rotations of their programs. These program -specific requirements preempt the dismissal process for the preprofessional years, and students failing to meet them may be subject to dismissal. For information about program -specific requirements for the professional years, students should contact the appropriate school dean and refer to the Good Academic Standing chart. A student recommended for dismissal may be continued by the school dean with or without conditions. If the school dean accepts the dismissal recommendation, the student will receive written notice of dismissal from the school dean. The notice will include procedures for appeal and will direct students to meet with an advisor to discuss a potential change of program. All change of programs must be finalized by the end of the add/drop period for the next enrolled semester. If students do not successfully appeal or meet the change o f program deadline they will be administratively withdrawn from the university. Administrative withdrawal letters will include notice of loss of housing, financial aid, and registration. T he following offices/individuals will be notified: Center for Acade mic Success and Enrichment, Dean of Students, Office of the Registrar, Residential Living and Learning, Information Services, Public Safety, Student Financial Services and Immigration Services/International Academic Services (if applicable). Students will be required to turn in their University ID and vacate University residence halls. A student whose conduct is unsatisfactory may be dismissed from the University at any time. In such a case, tuition and fees paid for the current academic semester will not be refunded. 85 - August 30, 2023 Reinstatement of Dismissed Students To be considered for readmission following dismissal by a school dean, the student must petition the Provost's Office, in writing, by the date designated in the Appeals Procedure guidelines that accompany the dismissal letter. The Provost's Office may uphold the dismissal, readmit the student, or readmit the student with conditions. If readmitted, the student's academic performance will be reviewed at the end of one academic semester. If the stude nt has failed to meet the stipulated conditions or, in the absence of stipulated conditions, failed to meet the minimum GPA required for good academic standing in that student's program, the student will be dismissed from the University. A student who has been dismissed twice is eligible for readmission to the same degree program only if (1) the student has been away from the University for a period of 12 months, and (2) the student has demonstrated academic success through coursework taken at another inst itution. If these conditions are met, the student may apply for readmission to the school dean. Readmission also will depend upon the availability of space in the program. Change of Program (Boston) A student requesting a change of program must schedule a n appointment with their Academic Coach in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) to discuss the decision to apply for a change of program. Prior to this meeting, the student must have a printed copy (from Self -Service) of their most recent program evaluation and a program evaluation for the new program. These audits should be brought to the meeting with the coach. When a new program has been chosen, the student may be required to schedule an appointment with the director of the program to which they wish to transfer. The student will submit to the program director a request for change of student status form, the program evaluation, and a \"what -if\" program evaluation, as well as a letter stating the reasons for transfer. All program requirem ents (available from the school dean's office) must be met. Once accepted, the program director will determine, if applicable, the new year of graduation (YOG). The student, the coach, the program director, and the appropriate school dean must sign the Cha nge of Program form. All written correspondence regarding the decision must be sent to the student, program director, Office of the Registrar, Student Financial Services, CASE, and school dean(s). If students have outstanding coursework taken external to M CPHS, the official transcripts must be received in the Office of the Registrar no later than the add/drop deadline for the term of entry. The student will receive official change of statu s email from the Office of the Registrar notifying them of requested program change. In order to register for classes in the new program, the completed and approved request for Change of Program form must be on file in the Office of the Registrar. Once admitted to a new program, a student must adhere to the program and GPA requirements commensurate with his or her new YOG. Depending on the intended new program, first -year students may change majors only after grades have been reviewed following the fall or spring semester. Students may begin the Change of Program process e arly, but they must meet with a coach in the CASE to review the Change of Program procedures, petition, and timeline. If a student moves from the Worcester/Manchester PharmD program to any program in Boston they will receive transfer credit for any course s that would be applied to the degree program, and the secondary degree would begin with a new degree audit. In this case, the residency requirement would be waived. Students cannot transfer from the Worcester or Manchester PharmD program into the Boston P harmD program. Recalculation of the Grade Point Average Students who wish to remove courses from their grade point average that are not required for the new program should note their request on the Change of Program form. All grades will remain on the tra nscript (and program evaluation), with the notation that they are not included in the grade point average. These requests must be approved by the new academic dean. Students who leave a program not in good academic standing and wish to move to another deg ree program or be readmitted to their former program must meet the grade point requirements of that YOG and program (see Good Academic Standing). Students who leave the PharmD program not in good standing must complete the new program and meet the grade po int average requirement required by the School of Pharmacy -Boston before seeking readmission into the PharmD program.

A formal Commencement ceremony is held once per year for all campuses in May. A December Commencement ceremony is held for degree programs with December completion dates. In order to be eligible to receive a degree on one of the above of ficial graduation dates, students must complete all degree requirements (including coursework, experiential education, instructional requirements, and financial clearance) by the following deadlines: May Last day of spring semester final exam period* September Last day of summer 12 -week semester December Last day of fall semester final exam period* Students who have completed degree requirements by the last day of the spring semester final exam period, or who earned their degree the previous S eptember or December, are eligible to participate in the formal May Commencement ceremony. Students who will complete all degree requirements by the last day of summer -12 week semester are eligible to participate. Students are eligible to participate in t he Commencement ceremony only as noted above. In the event of incomplete requirements (including outstanding financial balances), the school dean will make a change in the student's date of graduation (via the Change of Year of Graduation form). It is the responsibility of the individual student to ensure that they meet all degree requirements on schedule or risk delay in graduation. Graduation with Honors Summa cum laude 3.86-4.00 Magna cum laude 3.70-3.85 Cum laude The determination of honors is based on the graduate's final cumulative grade point average. Only students seeking a bachelor's degree or Doctor of Pharmacy who have completed at least 60 credits at MCPHS, or such number of credits that is applicable for compl etion of a given degree program, are eligible for honors. Honors designations appear on the student's final grade transcript but not on the diploma. First honor graduates are recognized during the Commencement ceremony. In order to be considered a first h onor graduate, one must be a student in a full -time undergraduate or entry -level program with at least three years of residency (except accelerated and/or fast track degree programs) and must not have earned any graduate or other advanced degree. 91 - August 30, 2023 Petition to Graduate Students must file a Petition to Graduate form online. Deadlines for submitting the forms also are posted online. Upon determination of completed requirements, students will be approved for graduation. In the event of incomplete requirements, the school dean will make a change in the student's year of graduation (YOG) via the Program Evaluation Update form. The student will be notified of this change and encouraged to meet with his or her program director and/or the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (Boston) to ensure satisfactory program completion within the new YOG. All tuition and fees must be paid to the University prior to graduation. Year of Graduation Whenever a student falls out of sequence in the curriculum of an academic p rogram, takes a leave of absence, or changes program, a change to year of graduation (YOG) may occur. If requesting to change programs, a student must complete a Change of Program form as part of the request to the school dean. The program director and sch ool dean will review the request for change of YOG as part of the acceptance process. The completed and signed Change of Program form will be distributed to (1) the school dean, (2) the student, (3) the Office of the Registrar, (4) Student Financial Servic es, (5) the program director, and (6) the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (Boston, Worcester/Manchester). Residency Requirement Students must complete (1) at least half of the required credits for a degree and (2) all professional course requirements in the respective degree program in residence at MCPHS. In special cases, the school dean may allow transfer credit for professional courses provided the student is able to demonstrate competency in the subject. If a program does not have spec ified professional courses, then half of all credits must be taken in residence. At least one -half of the courses required for a minor must be completed while in residence at MCPHS. \"In residence\" is defined as being registered for and enrolled in MCPHS co urses, whether the courses are delivered using traditional, hybrid, distance delivery, or online methods. Colleges of the Fenway courses are credited as MCPHS courses (including the number of credits). An exception to the residency requirement is granted t o those who hold licensure in a discipline and are enrolled in an MCPHS baccalaureate degree completion option. The residency requirement for such students is a minimum of 30 semester credits of MCPHS -approved courses. Bachelor of Science Completion Polic y In order to graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree at MCPHS, a student must complete the final 30 credits of their degree program enrolled in MCPHS courses or through an MCPHS approved articulation agreement. Internships, Licensure, and Certification Students graduating from the Acupuncture, Dental Hygiene, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Optometry, Pharmacy, Physical Therapy, and Physician Assistant programs at MCPHS will seek professional licensure in conjunction with a national examination in order to practi ce in their chosen profession. Regulations governing licensure (and internship) differ from state to state and country to country. The Registrar's Office completes application materials for licensure candidates and assists students in navigating the overal l licensing process. Licensure application preparation sessions are offered for students prior to graduation. Licensure application materials for all programs will not be released by the Registrar's Office until the degree and date awarded have been poste d to student records. Only materials with a submission deadline required for specific state board testing will be released prior to degree posting. Students enrolled in the Doctor of Pharmacy program will take part in practical experience overseen by a re gistered pharmacist. National Association of Boards of Pharmacy guidelines require that pharmacy students complete 1,500 clock hours of practical pharmacy experience prior to applying for licensure. Students completing their practical experience must regis ter as a pharmacy intern (as applicable) with the state in which they complete their internship experience. Internship hours must be documented as specified on the internship application form or state board of pharmacy website. As with licensure, intern el igibility criteria and paperwork differ from state to state. Mandatory intern preparation sessions are scheduled for students before they can apply for internship. Further information regarding the licensure and internship process can be found on the Regi strar's Office page of the University website. 92 - August 30, 2023 ACADEMICS University Learning Outcomes With a tradition of excellence in health care and science education since its founding in 1823, MCPHS University offers its students degree programs and co -curricular activities that are focused on knowledge and skills development. The University's mission statement affirms its primary goal of preparing students for successful careers in health care through excellence in teaching, scholarship, professional service and community engagement. MCPHS University prepares its graduates to: Possess interpersonal, oral, and written communication skills to effectively interact with a diverse population including patients, clients, customers, and colleagues. Create and sustain positive and productive professional relationships with patients, clients, customers, and colleagues. Apply technical knowledge, information literacy, cultural sensitivity, critical thinking skills, and problem -solving strategies necessary in professional settings to provide comprehensive services to patients, clients, and others. Collaborate ef fectively as a team member to bring projects to successful completion. Behave in a responsible manner and hold oneself and colleagues to the professional and ethical standards of their profession. Engage in lifelong learning and regular self -assessment to achieve continuous professional growth. 93 - August 30, 2023 Center for Interprofessional Practice and Education (CIPE) Over the past decade, MCPHS has embraced the importance of collaborative practice in healthcare delivery and has advanced Interprofessional Practice and Education (IPE) across a wide array of healthcare programs. Given the significance of preparing our graduates for interprofessional experiences within the healthcare environment and for the communities that they serve, IPE ha s been fully adopted by key stakeholders across the University. The IPE Boston and Worcester/Manchester Working Groups have provided an excellent framework and foundation in which to deliver IPE initiatives. The Academic Affairs Leadership is committed to supporting the faculty, staff, and students in advancing IPE experiences in curricular and co -curricular settings. The Offices of the President and Provost have fully supported the collaboration of the University's IPE Working Groups and the Academic Affai rs Leadership with a vision of creating a unified IPE model across the University. The Center for Interprofessional Practice and Education (CIPE) at MCPHS will support the University's vision of educating and training the next generation of collaborativ e healthcare leaders. The overall goal of the CIPE is to integrate and centralize IPE initiatives throughout the University. With the full support of the University's Academic Affairs Leadership and the IPE Working Groups from all campuses and online progr ams, the CIPE will serve as a resource for all MCPHS students to engage in IPE practice, education, scholarship/research, and service. The CIPE will provide the necessary infrastructure and support that will result in positive outcomes for our students, th e faculty/staff, and the institution as a whole. The organizational structure and governance of CIPE will support a unified strategy for advancing IPE goals even further. The Center will focus on advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in healthcare, fo stering interprofessional approaches to transform health disparities, and improve healthcare for underserved populations. 94 - August 30, 2023 General Education Requirements Preprofessional, general education and liberal arts distribution requirements for all baccalaureate and first professional degree programs are summarized below. Course sequences for the preprofessional and professional curriculum in a particular degree program may be found in the specific sections pertaining to each of the University's scho ols. Placement in Mathematics Courses Students are placed in mathematics courses based on their math placement exam scores, SAT or ACT scores, and degree program requirements. Any changes in assigned mathematics courses must be discussed with and approved by the coordinator of mathematics , an Associate Dean or the Dean in the School of Arts and Sciences before the end of the add/drop period at the beginning of the fall semester. Oral Proficiency Requirement \u2014Boston All students who enter the University in any bachelor of science , bachelor of arts, or first professional degree program must, as a requirement for graduation, demonstrate oral proficiency. In order to satisfy this requirement, students must meet the MCPH S Oral Proficiency Minimum Threshold as determined by oral communication faculty. Incoming students whose skills do not meet University standards must take LIB 253 Fundamentals of Oral Communication in Healthcare within the first year of matriculation. P lacement is determined by an evaluation of their skills, using the oral proficiency rubric. Successful completion of LIB 253 Fundamentals of Oral Communication in Healthcare satisfies the oral proficiency requirement. This course carries general elective credit (but not humanities credit). OPE Exemption Students are exempt from the OPE requirement only if they are matriculated in a program that requires a baccalaureate degree as a condition of admission, or if they are in a certificate program. Writing Proficiency Requirement \u2014Boston Students who enter the University without credit for LIB 111 (primarily first -year students) will select either a skills -building course, LIB 110 (Introduction to Academic Reading and Writing) or LIB 111 (Expository W riting I) during the summer before matriculation; students who do not make course choices will be placed into one of the two courses. To meet the writing proficiency (WP) requirement, these students must complete either the LIB 110, LIB 111, LIB 112 sequen ce or the LIB 111, LIB 112 sequence, and they must continue to meet WP standards as these are monitored across the curriculum. Students placed in LIB 110 will earn general elective credit. All students who have entered the University in any bachelor of science , bachelor of arts or first professional degree program and have credit for LIB 111 and LIB 112 (primarily transfer students) must meet WP standards as these are monitored across the curriculum. To ensure all students achieve and maintain WP, the School of Arts and Sciences has developed guidelines for writing - intensive (WI) courses and a system for WP referrals. In addition, faculty are encouraged to incorporate writing emphases in their classes wherever possible. In the School of Arts and Sciences, LIB 110, LIB 111, LIB 112, and all HUM courses are designated a s WI. WI courses meet the following criteria: The amount of required writing should be significant, approximately 3,750 -5,000 words (15 -20 pages) of graded writing. The total words/pages should be divided among two or more assignments, and at least one ass ignment should include a draft that students revise with instructor feedback. A single term paper / project is an option, but the project should include several smaller assignments (e.g., a project proposal, followed by a literature review or annotated bib liography, a completed draft, and a revised final project). Faculty should devote class time to instruction on writing practices in their disciplines (e.g., abstracts, writing style, citation conventions, and formats) and on strategies for successful compl etion of assignments; they should provide detailed writing assignment instructions and evaluation criteria. Faculty teaching WI courses should set aside a portion of the course grade (minimum of 40%) to be based on writing assignments (this is not grading for writing skills per se but for writing assignments that include demonstration of content learning). WI courses should have enrollments capped at 30 or fewer students. WI course faculty across the curriculum should employ shared proficiency and grading r ubrics when assessing students' WP or evaluating writing assignments. 95 - August 30, 2023 To continually reinforce WP standards, faculty across the curriculum use a shared WP rubric to identify students who appear to need additional skills development to meet WP standards. These students are referred to the University Writing Center, where the staff makes proficiency determinations. Based on individual situations, students may be assigned to writing tutors or workshops to address specific writing problems. Failure to comple te an assigned workshop or activity could result in a grading penalty or an incomplete grade in the referring course (based on syllabus requirements). The intent of the WP referral system is to integrate writing expectations, instruction, and development in disciplinary/professional contexts that build on foundations established in the general education curriculum. Information Literacy Requirements \u2014Boston As a requirement for graduation, all undergraduate, preprofessional, and transfer students must demonstrate proficiency in information literacy by passing a series of three non -credit online courses - INF 110: Introduction to Research Essentials, INF 220: Intermediate Research Skills, and INF 330: Advanced Research Skills. INF 110 must be completed during the student's first year at MCPHS; most students will complete this course as a required part of Introduction to the Major. INF 220 is typically assigned during the student's second year, and INF 330 is assigned during the third year. Each information literacy course is to be completed by the student during the year it is assigned . Exemptions from General Education Requirements \u2014Boston Students enrolled in a certificate program or in a degree program for which a baccalaureate degree is an admission requirement are exempted from the core curriculum, oral and writing proficiency, and library module requirements. Students in the 30 -month Physician Assistant Studies program (Boston) are an exception in that they are required to complete the library module requirement though they are exempt from the core curriculum and oral and writing proficiency requirements. Exemptions from General Education Requirements \u2014Worcester/Manchester Students enrolled in degree programs on the Worcester and Manches ter campuses are exempt from general education requirements, provided they have completed a baccalaureate degree at an accredited institution of higher education in the United States. (Applicants must still fulfill all prerequisite courses required for adm ission to their degree program.) Medical Terminology Requirement Competency in medical terminology is required of students in certain degree programs. Students usually meet this competency within their programs. A medical terminology course taken off campus is not awarded general elective credit in any program. All School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics students in accelerated baccalaureate programs are required to pass (with a grade of C+ or higher) RSC 250 Elements of Clinical Care for the Radiol ogic Sciences prior to progressing into their first clinical internship course (NMT 330C or MRI 402 or RAD 201C or RTT 325C). Students who are unsuccessful in their first attempt to pass RSC 250 may be delayed in progression in their curriculum while repe ating the course. Note that students are allowed only two attempts to successfully complete a course. Failure to successfully achieve a grade of C+ or higher in the second attempt of RSC 250, therefore, will result in dismissal from the School of Medical I maging and Therapeutics program. Medical terminology is a prerequisite for admission to all fast -track School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics programs excluding MRI. Students may take this course online through the School of Professional Studies. Introduction to the Major All students entering the University as first -year students (including first year transfer students) must take a 1 -semester - hour Introduction to the Major (ITM) during the fall semester. The seminar is designed to ease the transitio n from high school to college by orienting students to MCPHS resources, career opportunities, and the academic skills needed for classroom success. Arts and Sciences Core Curriculum The Core Curriculum consists of 40 credit hours (c.h.) in 6 different academic domains; Behavioral Sciences, Communication, Humanities, Natural Sciences, Numeracy, Social Sciences. Each academic domain consists of 2 categories of courses ( e.g., Composition, Ethics, Statistics). Students are required to pass one c ourse in each of the 12 categories, with the exception of Composition, which requires two courses. All students in baccalaureate and first professional degree programs are required to complete the Core Curriculum. Many degree programs specify which cours es must be taken in specific disciplines. 96 - August 30, 2023 Behavioral Sciences Introduction to Behavioral Sciences (1 course, 3 c.h.)

Health Insurance According to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and MCPHS policy, all matriculated students (regardless of enrollment) must be covered by a health insurance program. The University makes available a general health insurance program that meets these standards. This policy is provided by an independent carrier beginning September 1 and continuing for 12 months. University student health insurance information is located on the MCPHS website under Student Health. Students will b e automatically enrolled in this plan unless a waiver is completed and received by Student Financial Services prior to the first day of classes. Students registering late must submit the waiver at that time. The waiver stipulates that personal coverage wil l be maintained during the enrollment period. If Student Financial Services does not receive the waiver prior to the first day of classes, the student will be billed for the insurance premium and will remain responsible for payment of said premium. The wai ver must be renewed annually. All international students will be enrolled in the University student health insurance plan automatically, with the exception of those international students whose sponsoring institutions have a signed agreement with MCPHS th at complies with the University's health insurance waiver requirements, or international students with a plan for which the insurer's primary home office is based in the United States and the policy provides comparable coverage to the University student health insurance plan. International students who do not fall under one of the two conditions above must purchase the University student health insurance plan.

It is an educational tool with the purposes of holding students accountable for Code of Conduct violations, educa ting students regarding their behaviors in the MCPHS community, and guiding students towards a greater sense of personal responsibility. A. MCPHS recognizes that students are entitled to respect and consideration. MCPHS further recognizes students' rights within the institution to freedom of inquiry and to responsibly use University services and facilities. B. Students at MCPHS have a responsib ility to act in a manner that promotes the wellbeing, respect, safety, inclusion, and security of all members of the University community. C.

The Dean of Students or their designee will review the Academic Honesty Policy, issues of dishonesty, and consequences of violating the Academic Honesty Policy w ith new students during their orientation. 117 - August 30, 2023 2. The Academic Honesty Policy will be provided by the Office of Student Affairs to all members of the MCPHS community online through the MCPHS Student Handbook. All entering MCPHS students are expected to acknowled ge they have read the Academic Honesty Policy via an online process coordinated by the Office of Student Affairs. Refusal to do so may result in more severe sanctions should a student be found responsible for an academic honesty violation. 3. In specific tes ting and/or evaluation situations, students may be required to present their MCPHS ID cards to verify identity, including in situations where remote proctoring tools are used. 4. Each instructor is responsible for informing students of the standards of behav ior expected of students in the classroom, laboratory, and clinical sites and for consistently enforcing such standards. 5. Faculty may in their discretion require that students sign an academic honesty statement for exams and written graded assignments. This statement may be defined by each School or Program for specific requirements for in-person or remote assessment methods. The statement will read as follows: Academic Honesty Statement I pledge that I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid, and will not give or receive unauthorized aid, on any examination, paper, and/or assignment. Student Name (printed)________ ________________________________________ Student Signature:___________________________ ID Number:_______________ Plagiarism Prevention Service Students are expected to abide by the University's Academic Honesty Policy. Plagiarism (see Offense 3.0 above) is considered a violation of this policy. In order to deter plagiarism and ensure the appropriate use of resources in student research and learning, the University subscribes to a plagiarism prevention service. Faculty may in their discretion require stude nts to submit their written work electronically through this plagiarism prevention service in order to verify that when ideas of others are used, they are cited appropriately. Each course syllabus will identify student work that must be submitted electroni cally for such review. Academic Honesty and Exams The Academic Deans and Program Directors are responsible for the proper conduct of examinations in their respective schools and programs, and they will assign faculty and graduate assistants to serve as proctors for examinations. Support staff, under the supervision of the Academic Deans and Program Directors, are responsible for maintaining confidentiality in the production and reproduction of examinations. Instructors are expected to assist in the promotion of academic honesty through the following practices: Access to and use of \"recycled\" exams should be limited. Students will be required to leave all unnecessary materials (e.g., backpacks, notebooks, textbooks, calculators, PDAs, cell phone s, etc.) away from their seat assignment . Only required or approved materials will be allowed at the seat assignment . This requirement also applies to remote exams as implemented by the respective school or program. All exams, whether in person or virtuall y, will be proctored unless otherwise specified. In specific evaluation situations, students may be asked to show instructors or proctors materials being used during the exam (PDAs, cell phones, etc.) to ensure proper use of the allowed material and adher ence to the Academic Honesty Policy. Instructors are encouraged to utilize the following exam seating practices whenever possible: Students entering an exam room will be randomly seated. Seating assignments will be spaced throughout the exam room, allowing for adequate spaces between students. Additional requirements for integrity during remote exams will be specified by remote proctoring software and/or by the School, Program, and course instructor. 118 - August 30, 2023 The instructor should follow the Academic Honesty Policy when giving examinations and ensure that proctors are present at all examinations in compliance with the policy. At least one (1) course coordinator for each course should be pres ent during an examination to answer questions or to clarify issues that may arise. Exceptions to this rule must be approved by the respective Academic Dean or Program Director. Students are expected to report violations of the Academic Honesty Policy to t he instructor and/or the department/division chair or program director of the academic department for further investigation. Additional policies for academic honesty and integrity in a remote learning environment may be further required by each School or Program. Student Discipline Procedures for Academic Honesty Policy Violations The University maintains a policy of open communication among all members of the University community. Hence, the first step in attempting to resolve a student's alleged violation of the Academic Honesty Policy may be a meeting between the faculty member a nd the student. If the faculty member elects, in their discretion, to hold a meeting, they shall schedule it within seven (7) business days of the faculty member's knowledge of the alleged academic dishonesty incident. A student is not required to partici pate in the faculty meeting. However, if a student does not agree to participate, and therefore cannot provide a response to the faculty member's evidence of alleged academic honesty policy violations, the faculty member may render a determination that aca demic dishonesty did occur and issue an appropriate sanction. The student then has the opportunity to appeal the case and the sanction as set forth below. At the meeting, the faculty member will give the student a copy of the Academic Honesty Policy and S tudent Discipline Procedures and offer the Office of Student Affairs as a resource to discuss student rights and responsibilities. The faculty member will provide the student with the information the faculty member has regarding the alleged incident and w ill provide the accused student the opportunity to respond to the presented information. After listening to the student's response, the faculty member will do one of the following: Determine academic dishonesty did not occur and not pursue the incident f urther. OR Determine academic dishonesty did occur and discuss with the student the academic sanction the faculty member will assign (repeat of the assignment, grade reduction, failure of the assignment or exam, failure of the course). If consequences re garding academic dishonesty are listed in the course syllabus, the faculty member must adhere to the consequences as indicated in the syllabus. The faculty member will provide the student with the option to meet with a staff member in the Office of Student Affairs to review the student's rights and responsibilities prior to the faculty member finalizing their decision. If the student accepts the faculty -assigned consequence, the case is closed unless the student has a prior violation of the Academic Honesty Policy or the violation is so severe that a hearing is deemed necessary by the Office of Student Affairs. There is no option for appeal in a closed case. If the faculty member and the student do not agree on the determination of the case, the stud ent can appeal the case to the academic school dean or program director (or their designee), as instructed by Student Affairs. The academic dean or program director (or their designee) shall meet with the involved parties either individually or jointly, to review the case within seven (7) business days of the initial faculty/student meeting. Subsequent to the meeting and case review, the academic dean or program director (or their designee) may do one of the following: Determine academic dishonesty did no t occur and not pursue the incident further. OR Determine academic dishonesty did occur and discuss the academic sanction they will assign (repeat of the assignment, grade reduction, failure of the assignment or exam, or failure of the course). If conseq uences regarding academic dishonesty are listed in the course syllabus, the academic sanctions must adhere to the consequences as indicated in the syllabus. The decision of the academic dean or program director will be provided to the student within five (5) business days following the final meeting. These appellate decisions are final. 119 - August 30, 2023 Faculty and academic deans/program directors (or their designees) report, consult, and work collaboratively with the Office of Student Affairs regarding each al leged academic dishonesty incident. Students should be advised that, regardless of the academic resolution, all violations of the Academic Honesty Policy will be reported to and recorded with the Office of Student Affairs. When a student has accepted respo nsibility for the Academic Honest Policy violation after discussion with the course faculty member or academic dean or program director (or their designee), the Dean of Students (or their designee) will send a letter to the student, faculty member, and aca demic dean or program director, with a copy to the Office of Student Affairs, outlining the academic sanction agreed upon among the involved parties (e.g., loss of points, change of grade, failure of exam, etc.), along with a notification of a student cond uct sanction, the minimum being a disciplinary warning, to be determined by the Dean of Students or their designee in their sole discretion. Should the Dean of Students (or their designee) determine that further action is required, based upon the disciplin ary history of the student or the severity of the violation, then the matter will be processed as outlined in the Community Standards System in a hearing, as appropriate. Complex incidents of alleged academic dishonesty that require extensive fact finding or involve a conflict of interest (e.g., the academic dean is the instructor for the course in which academic dishonesty is alleged) may be referred by the faculty member or academic dean or program director (or their designee) immediately to the Office o f Student Affairs for review and disciplinary procedures as provided in the Community Standards System. NOTE: A student may continue attending class during the resolution process for an academic dishonesty incident. If a final decision is made that a stud ent has failed a course due to academic dishonesty, and no option for further appeal exists, the student must immediately cease attending the class in which the academic dishonesty incident occurred. Sanctions for Academic Dishonesty In determining a sa nction, the University may consider the responsible student's past disciplinary history, the nature and severity of the offense, the severity of any resulting damage, injury, or harm, the student's cooperation throughout the process and acceptance of respo nsibility, and other relevant factors. Students whose behavior is contrary to the Code of Conduct are subject to the maximum sanction of dismissal from the University or any lesser sanction for any act of misconduct. Academic dishonesty sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following: The faculty member and the academic dean or program director (or their designee) may impose the sanction of repeating an assignment, receiving a score of zero on the exam/assignment where academic dishonesty occurred, receiving a lowered assignment/exam/course grade, or failing the course. The Dean of Students (or their designee) may assign the sanction of a disciplinary warning, disciplinary probation, deferred suspension, suspension, or expul sion from the University in accordance with the Academic Honesty Policy and the Community Standards System. The Dean of Students (or their designee) may also assign educational sanction(s) related to academic honesty, including referral to the writing center o r follow up meetings. The Dean of Students (or their designee) shall communicate their decisions regarding violations of the Academic Honesty Policy, academic sanctions, and disciplinary sanctions to the student in writing once a case has been closed. Students are subject to academic sanctions from faculty at other members of the Colleges of the Fenway (COF) should they commit academic violations while taking a COF course, and such cases are referred to the Office of Student Affairs. Such offenses will als o be addressed under the MCPHS Academic Honesty Policy and Community Standards System.

Educational Conferences within the informal resolution process are typically scheduled within ten (10) business days by the Dean of Students, or their designee, following their receipt of a report of a potential violation of the Community Standards System. Schedule an Administrative Conference Students who accept responsibility for offenses they committed may first be referred to an Administrative Conference.

The decision of the representative from Student Affairs will be delivered to the student in writing following the meeting. Health/Medical Leave of Absence A Health/Medical Leave of Absence may be appropriate when a student's current physical or behavioral health condition precludes successful complete of their educational program. In addition to following the steps outlined for a general Leave of Absence, a student seeking a Health/Medical Leave of Absence must submit medical documentation from the student's medical provider to the Office of Student Affairs. This documentation must indicate the medical reasons the student is unable to attend classes for the requested time period. In conjunction with submitting this documentation, the student must meet with representatives from Student Affairs on their respective campus and complete appropriate paperwork. At least one full academic semester must have passed b efore returning to the University under a Health/Medical Leave of Absence. Return from Health/Medical Leave of Absence In addition to the general Leave of Absence steps for returning to the University, a student will provide to the Office of Student Affairs, on their respective campus, documentation from the student's medical provider that indicates the student's readiness to return to class, that includes: a diagnosis of the condition that led to the student's leave; the student's length and course of treatment; the student's current medical health status; recommendations necessary for ongoing care; recommendation that s tudent can safely return to classes with either full -time status or a reduced course load; any noted restrictions including those related to technical requirements of the student's academic program. A student will also need to meet with a representative f rom the Office of Student Affairs to finalize the return process. Involuntary Health/Medical Leave of Absence The Dean of Students or designee may issue an involuntary health withdrawal, whether or not the student's behavior violates the Student Code of Conduct. An involuntary health leave of absence must involve a strong likelihood of a. serious risk of physical harm to the student themself, manifested by evidence of threats of suicide or attempts at suicide or other serious bodily harm; b. serious risk of physical harm to other persons in the community, including an infectious condition or evidence of homicidal or other violent behavior; and/or c. reasonable risk of physical impairment or injury to the student themself because of impaired j udgment that would not allow the student to live independently or protect them in the community or not allow the student to perform the essential functions of an educational program without requiring substantial modification of the program. Process for In voluntary Leave of Absence Report and Initial Meeting Upon receiving a report documenting the behavior(s) that indicate why a student should be put on involuntary health leave, the Dean of Students or designee will meet with the student regarding the repor t. Suspension Pending Determination The student may be suspended immediately from the University or University residence hall pending the determination of the involuntary health leave of absence when, on the basis of the information available, the Univers ity reasonably believes that the student's continued presence on campus endangers the physical safety or well -being of themselves or others or seriously disrupts the educational process of the University. Either before suspension or as promptly as is feasible, the student will be given the opportunity to be heard and present evidence as to why they should not be immediately suspended. 136 - August 30, 2023 Evaluation The Dean of Students or designee may inform the student orally or in writing that they must participate in a me dical or mental health evaluation conducted by one of the following: a. MCPHS Executive Director of Counseling Services or designee (in the case of psychological disorder) b. An independent evaluator (licensed social worker, licensed mental health counse lor, licensed psychologist [including psychiatrist], or licensed medical doctor) selected by the student at the student's expense The student must sign a release of information form authorizing the evaluator to consult with MCPHS staff regarding the evalu ation. The evaluation must be completed within 24 hours of the date of written or verbal notice or as soon as reasonable, as determined by the Dean of Students or designee. The Dean of Students or designee may grant an extension for completion. If the st udent fails to complete or refuses to participate in an evaluation when referred, they may be issued an involuntary health leave of absence. Determination Upon completion of the evaluation, the MCPHS staff member who conducts or consults in the evaluation will make a recommendation to the Dean of Students or designee. An opportunity must be provided for the student to discuss the recommendations with the MCPHS staff member who conducted or consulted in the evaluation and with the Dean of Students or designee. The student will be given the opportunity to be heard and present evidence as to why they should not be issued an involuntary health leave of absence. The Dean of Students or designee will make a determination and inform the student in writi ng. Effective Date Once the involuntary health leave of absence is issued, the terms of the leave become effective immediately. A student's record will indicate the leave date and the reason for involuntary health leave. All courses for which a student i s registered at the time of leave will receive a grade of W, and the refund policy as outlined in the University catalog will be followed. Requests for special consideration regarding the refund policy (e.g., leave date beyond the refund date) may be made to the Dean of Students. The safety of the student while on campus must be assured. Advance notice of an involuntary health leave is recommended only when the safety of the student while on campus is assured. In the case of emergencies, no advance notice may be possible. Appeal A student who has been issued an involuntary health leave of absence may appeal the decision to the Vice President for Academic Affairs in writing within five business days of receiving the decision. The student's reasons for the a ppeal and the desired resolution must be indicated in the letter. The Vice President for Academic Affairs will consider the case within five business days of the request for an appeal. The decision of the Vice President for Academic Affairs is final and wi ll be communicated to the student in writing. Return after Leave of Absence In order to remove the conditions of the leave of absence, the student must present medical documentation that the reason for the involuntary health leave of absence no longer pre cludes successful completion of an educational program. The student also must participate in an evaluation conducted by University staff, by an established deadline, and write a letter to the Dean of Students or designee detailing the student's readiness t o return to the University. In most cases, at least one academic semester must have passed before readmission under an involuntary health leave may be considered. Deviations from Established Policies Reasonable deviations from this policy will not invali date a decision or proceeding unless significant prejudice to a student may result. Withdrawal from a Course Students may withdraw from a course by the deadline published on the Academic Calendar for each respective semester. No refunds are given after t he end of the official add/drop period. After the official add/drop period, students who choose to withdraw receive a grade of W for the course. The withdrawal slip must be signed by the student's 137 - August 30, 2023 academic coach. Every registered student who remains in a c ourse is given a grade. Simply failing to attend classes does not constitute course withdrawal. Students taking self -paced prerequisite courses in the School of Professional Studies may request to be withdrawn through the end of the 16th week. Once a final grade is given, a withdrawal will not be considered. Withdrawal requests must be submitted in the Student Gateway or by emailing professionalstudies@mcphs.edu. If the withdrawal is approved, students will be withdrawn from their course and receive a W on their transcript. No refunds will be given. University Withdrawal A student must complete an exit interview prior to withdrawing from the University. Boston, Worcester, and Manchester students must meet with a CASE representative. Online students must meet with their program director. The withdrawal process includes an exit interview with a designated University representative, the completion of a withdrawal form, and acquiring signatures from Student Financial Services and Immigration Services (if applicable). Failure to complete the withdrawal process results in automa tic failure in all courses in which the student is currently enrolled and forfeiture of any prorated tuition refund. Withdrawn students are not eligible for University services. 138 - August 30, 2023 Immunization Policy In accordance with state law and University policy, s tudents must show proof of required immunizations. Non - compliance with University immunization requirements will result in adverse action up to and including administrative withdrawal from the University, and may negatively impact progression in an academi c program. How and when to report your immunizations to MCPHS: Students must submit documentation demonstrating compliance with the MCPHS Immunization Policy prior to the first day of the first semester of admission to the University. MCPHS Universit y works with an external company, CastleBranch, to support immunization tracking and management. The following MCPHS students must show proof of required immunizations: All full -time students, including students attending MCPHS while on a visa who w ill be on campus; All part -time students, including students attending MCPHS while on a visa who will be on campus; All online students who might be in contact with patients; All online students whose program involves an on -campus component; and All students attending or visiting MCPHS as part of a formal academic visitation or exchange program.

Waivers/Exemp tions If a student is unable to obtain one or more immunizations due to medical or religious reasons, they may upload the Student Vaccine Exemption Request Form to CastleBranch. Students who are unable to obtain one or more immunizations for medical reas ons must also submit a letter (on official letterhead with a signature) from the student's health care provider certifying that the provider has personally examined the student and is of the opinion that the student's health would be endangered by the immu nization. Medical and religious exemptions must be renewed annually at the start of each school year. 145 - August 30, 2023 In addition to the medical and religious exemptions detailed above, students may qualify for an exemption from the meningococcal immunization require ment if the student (or the student's parent or legal guardian, if the student is a minor) signs a waiver stating that the student has received information about the dangers of meningococcal disease, reviewed the information provided and elected to decline the vaccine. A copy of this waiver is available for download in your CastleBranch account. Requirements for clinical rotations are set by clinical sites and MCPHS does not have the authority to override these requirements. Medical and religious exempti ons may be accepted at the discretion of clinical sites. Failure to obtain all immunizations required to participate in clinicals or other activities with patient contact may negatively impact progression in certain academic programs. Please contact your C linical Coordinator for your academic program to discuss how waivers/exemptions may affect your clinical rotation requirements. Additional Information Certain health care agencies and clinical training and service learning sites may have additional immun ization requirements. In order to be eligible for clinical placements or service learning experiences, students must meet all University immunization requirements and any additional site requirements. In cases where the site does not pay for the completion of additional immunization requirements, the student is responsible for paying any associated fees, if it is not covered by their personal health insurance. Without clearance with respect to all University and site immunization requirements, students will not be permitted to begin clinical or service learning placements, and therefore, would be unable to meet program requirements. Students who change academic programs must become compliant with all immunization requirements of their new academic progra m. Students must contact their Program Director/Clinical Coordinator for necessary steps to review their immunization compliance with the new academic program. MCPHS works with a confidential health information service company that maintains and processes all student immunization records and monitors compliance with state law immunization requirements. Authorized officials at MCPHS have access to student immunization records to monitor compliance.

POLICY STATEMENT Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (\"MCPHS\" or the \"University\") is committed to maintaining a positive living, learning, and working environment that is free from all forms of Sexual Hara ssment, which is a form of sex discrimination. The University does not discriminate based on sex, in admission and access to, and treatment and employment in, its education program or activity or while a person is attempting to participate in an education program or activity. For discrimination and harassment that is not of a sexual nature, please refer to the University's Protection from Discrimination and Harassment Policy. The University actively complies with the requirements of Title IX of the Educ ational Amendments of 1972 and pertinent laws, regulations, and executive directives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and other applicable state and federal statutes. This Policy defines prohibited sexual misconduct and identifies the procedures tha t will be utilized to investigate and adjudicate possible violations of this policy. This policy does not preclude application or enforcement of other University policies. Individuals who violate this Policy are subject to discipline and corrective a ction, up to and including termination or expulsion. The University will not tolerate sexual harassment in any form or related retaliation against or by any employee or student. The University recognizes that discrimination and harassment related to a person's sex can occur in connection with misconduct rel ated to a person's sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, age, disability, or other protected classes. Targeting a person based on these characteristics is also a violation of state and f ederal law and the University's Protection from Discrimination and Harassment Policy. As appropriate, the University will endeavor to coordinate the investigation and resolution of sexual harassment complaints with the investigation and resolution of comp laints of discrimination or harassment based on other protected classes. There is a presumption that the Respondent is not responsible for the alleged conduct until a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the grievance pro cess. There is a presumption of innocence throughout the grievance process, with the burden on the university to gather information and to prove that the conduct violated the policy. Inquiries regarding the University's compliance with Equal Opportuni ty and Affirmative Action laws should be directed to the chief Human Resources Officer, Kevin Dolan at Kevin.Dolan@mcphs.edu or 617.732.2144. II. REPORTING OBLIGATIONS Obligations to Report Sexual Harassment . In order to take appropriate corrective acti on, the university must be aware of sexual harassment, and related retaliation that occurs in university employment, educational programs, and activities. The following individuals have a duty to report whenever they witness, receive notification of, or o therwise have knowledge of an incident of discrimination, harassment, or related retaliation that occurred in the course of University employment, educational programs, or activities. All University Officers; All Deans, Department Chairs, and Program Directors; The Title IX Coordinator; All employees with supervisory authority; All employees in Human Resources; and All employees in Public Safety.

A complainant has the right to file a criminal complaint before, during or after the university's Title IX investigation. Amnesty Policy . The university encourages the reporting of all concerns regarding sexual harassment. Sometimes indivi duals are hesitant to report instances of sexual harassment because they fear being charged with other policy violations. Because the university has a paramount interest in protecting the well -being of its community and remedying sexual harassment, other policy violations will be considered, if necessary, separately from allegations under this policy. Zero-Tolerance for Retaliation . The university will not tolerate retaliation by any employee or student. Retaliation is a serious violation of this poli cy, as well as of federal, state, and local law. Anyone who believes he or she is a victim of retaliation should report the matter immediately according to the same procedure provided in this policy for making complaints of discrimination, harassment, or sexual assault.

Equitable remedies should include supportive measures for the parties that are non -disciplinary, non -punitive in nat ure and designed to restore or preserve equal access to education programs and activities while addressing the allegations through a fair and unbiased grievance process. THE COMPLAINT The university has actual knowledge of a potential Title IX violation when notification is given to the Title IX Coordinator or any official who has the authority to institute corrective measures. Upon notification of a potential Title IX violation, the Title IX Coordinator will promptly contact the complainant t o discuss supportive measures; to consider the complainants wishes with respect to supportive measures; to inform the complainant of availability of these measures with or without the filing of a formal complaint; and to explain the grievance process and t he procedure for filing a formal complaint. Emergency Removal of a student -respondent may still be appropriate, provided the university does an individualized safety and risk analysis; determines there is an immediate threat to the physical health or saf ety of students or employees that justifies removal; and, provides notice and an opportunity for the respondent to challenge the decision immediately following removal. Non -student employees may be placed on administrative leaves during investigations. The complainant or Title IX Coordinator file a document alleging sexual harassment against a respondent and requesting that the university investigate the allegation of sexual harassment, known as a \"formal complaint.\" A complainant may only file a formal Title IX complaint under this policy if the complainant is participating in or attempting to participate in an education program or activity of the university. The university treats the complainant and respondent equitably throughout the grievance pro cess. All university officials involved in the grievance process must not have a conflict of interest or bias for or against either party. The respondent is presumed not to be responsible for the alleged conduct until a determination regarding responsibi lity is made at the conclusion of the grievance process. The parties are advised as to the range of possible disciplinary sanctions and remedies that the university may implement following any determination of responsibility. The university will determin e responsibility based on the evidentiary standard of Preponderance of the Evidence and both parties are permitted to appeal the final decision. The university will provide for an informal resolution process such as mediation after the filing of a formal complaint. Informal resolution does not involve a full investigation and adjudication. The informal resolution process may begin at any time prior to a determination regarding responsibility. The university must provide the parties with the written not ice as to the allegations and the requirements of the informal resolution process. The parties must voluntarily agree and provide written consent to the Informal resolution process. The parties have the right to withdraw from the informal process and par ticipate in the formal grievance process any time prior to a determination regarding responsibility. Informal resolution is not permitted in cases of harassment of a student by an employee. B. TITLE IX INVESTIGATION Initiating the investigation . Upon rece ipt of a formal complaint, the Title IX Coordinator will provide written notice to the parties of the allegations of sexual harassment, including sufficient details known at the time of filing and allowing sufficient time to prepare a response before the i nitial interview. The details include the identity of the parties, the alleged conduct constituting sexual harassment, the date and location of the alleged conduct. The written notice must contain a statement that the respondent is presumed not responsib le for the alleged conduct and that a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the grievance process. The notice must inform the parties that they may have an advisor of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an at torney. The notice must inform the parties of the section of the Student Code of Conduct that prohibits knowingly making false statements or knowingly submitting false information during the grievance process. 151 - August 30, 2023 Time frame . The university will endeavor t o complete its investigation in sixty (60) days. However, there may be reasonable delays or extensions as circumstances arise. Standard of Proof . The \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard shall be applied to sexual harassment complaints. This st andard requires a finding that it is more likely than not that sexual harassment occurred in order to assign responsibility to the respondent. Gathering information . The university will conduct prompt and thorough interviews of the complainant, the respondent, and any witnesses. Both parties will have an opportunity to suggest witnesses. The investigator will interview the suggested witnesses unless the investigator determines that the information that the party claims the witness will share is not rele vant. The burden of gathering both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence and proof sufficient to reach a determination of responsibility is on the university. The university will not restrict the ability of either party to discuss the allegations under in vestigation or gather and present relevant evidence. The parties are both allowed to have their advisor of choice present during any grievance proceeding. The university may restrict the extent to which the advisor may participate in the proceedings as l ong as the restrictions apply equally to both parties. Written notice of the date, time, location, participants, and purpose of all hearings, interviews or meetings must be provided to a party whose participation is invited or expected with sufficient tim e for the party to prepare to participate. An investigative report will be generated at the end of the investigation. Prior to completion of the investigative report, the Title IX Coordinator will send each party and their advisors any evidence gathered that is directly related to the allegations for their inspection and review with ten (10) days -notice to submit a written response, prior to completion of the final investigative report. The final investigative report is sent to the parties and their advi sors ten (10) days prior to the live hearing.

Live Hearing The parties (through their advisors) may make opening statements and the decision makers may question the parties and their witnesses prior to and after any cross -examination. Cross-examination . The decision makers preside over the live hearing, permit each party's advisor to ask the other party, and witnesses all relevant questions. The cross -examination must be conducted directly, orally, and in real time by the advisor and not the party. Either party can request that the live hearing occur virtuall y with the parties in separate rooms. The technology is to allow the decision makers and parties to simultaneously see and hear the cross - examination of the party or witness. Only relevant questions will be answered. The decision makers make a determina tion as to relevancy after the question is asked and before the answer given. The university must provide an advisor, without fee, to a party who does not have an advisor present for the live hearing. Recording or Transcript . The university must cr eate an audiovisual recording or transcript of the live hearing and make it available to the parties for inspection and review. Determination Regarding Responsibility. The decision makers must issue a written determination regarding responsibility simul taneously to the parties using the preponderance of the evidence standard. The written statement must include the allegations constituting sexual harassment, describe the procedural steps taken, the findings of fact supporting the determination, conclusio ns regarding the application of this Policy and a statement the findings and the rationale, as well as the procedures and basis for appeal. D. Appeal . Both respondent and complainant may appeal a determination regarding responsibility and from a dismissal of a formal complaint based on: (1) procedural irregularity that affected the outcome; (2) new evidence not previously available that could affect the outcome; and (3) bias or conflict of interest on the part of a Title IX official that affecte d the outcom e. The university must maintain records for seven years of all sexual harassment investigations, appeals, informal resolutions, all materials used to train Title IX officials and make such materials available on its website, hearing recordings and transc ripts, records of any actions, including supportive measures, taken in response to reports or formal complaint of sexual harassment. V. COMPLAINTS INVOLVING TWO OR MORE MCPHS UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES The Title IX Coordinator has oversight for all Title IX ca ses. When an alleged violation of this policy involves more than one MCPHS University campus, individuals approved by the Title IX Coordinator at the campus with disciplinary authority over the respondent may handle the complaint. 152 - August 30, 2023 VI. COMPLAINTS BY AND AGAINST UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS ARISING IN AN AFFILIATED ENTITY University employees and students sometimes work or study at the worksite or program of another organization affiliated with MCPHS. When a violation of this policy is alleged by or against University employees or students in those circumstances, the compl aint should immediately be directed to the Title IX Coordinator.

POLICY STATEMENT Massachusett s College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (\"MCPHS\" or the \"University\") does not discriminate in admission, treatment, or access to its programs or activities or in employment in its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, physical or mental disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, ancestry, genetic information, military service, marital status, familial status, or veteran status and actively complies with the requ irements of Federal Executive Orders 11246 and 11375 as amended; the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended; Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 as amended; Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; Section 402, Vietnam Era Veterans Rea djustment Assistance Act of 1974; the Age Discrimination Act of 1975; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008); and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and executive directives . The University will not tolerate acts of discrimination or harassment based upon Protected Classes, or related retaliation against any individual for complaining of or participating in an investigation or proceeding relating to a complaint of discriminat ion or harassment based upon a Protected Class. For purposes of this policy, \"Protected Classes\" refers to race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, physical or mental disability, creed, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, gender iden tity, gender expression, ancestry, genetic information, military service, marital status, familial status, veteran status and any other characteristic protected by law. Discrimination: Treating individuals or groups less favorably because of their Protected Class. Harassment: Unwelcome and/or offensive behavior, based on one or more of the Protected Classes, that subjects an individual to inferior terms, conditions or privileges of ed ucation or employment. Harassing conduct rises above the level of what a similarly situated reasonable person would consider petty slights or trivial inconveniences. Harassment can take many forms, such as words, visual images, gestures, or other verbal or physical conduct by any means. Harassment may include, but is not limited to: Epithets, slurs, or negative stereotyping; Threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; and The circulation or display of written or graphic material that belittles or shows h ostility or aversion toward an individual or group including through e -mail and other electronic media. Retaliation: Retaliation is taking or threatening any adverse action against an individual (or group of individuals) because of their participation in any manner in an investigation or proceeding under this Policy, including individuals who file a report, are interviewed, or otherwise provide evidence in the investigation. Retaliation includes threatening, intimidating, harassing, or any other conduct th at would discourage a reasonable person from engaging in activity protected under this Policy. The process outlined in this policy applies to all complaints of unlawful discrimination or harassment, except those alleging any form of Sexual Harassment. Any person alleging Sexual Harassment, including sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking, on the part of any University student, faculty or staff member, affiliate (e.g. visit or, vendor, etc.) or non -affiliate, should refer to the Univ ersity's Protection from Sexual Harassment (Title IX) Policy. Allegations of Sexual Harassment must be evaluated by the Title IX Coordinator to determine whether the conduct falls within the definition of Title IX. Allegations that do not fall within the jurisdiction of the Title IX policy, as determined by the Title IX Coordinator, may be referred for investigation and adjudication pursuant to the procedures set forth below. Inquiries regarding the University's compliance with Equal Opportunity and Aff irmative Action laws may be directed to the Chief Human Resources Officer, Kevin Dolan, at Kevin.Dolan@mcphs.edu or 617.732.2144. II. REPORTING In order to take appropriate corrective action, the University must be aware of discrimination, harassment, an d related retaliation that occurs in University employment, educational programs, and activities. MCPHS strongly encourages anyone who believes that they have experienced or witnessed discrimination, harassment, or related retaliation to report such behavi or immediately. Where to Report. Allegations or complaints may be directed to the Chief Human Resources Officer and/or the Dean of Students (in either case, the individual receiving the complaint is referred to herein as the \"Designated Officer\"). In cases involving complaints or allegations against either the Chief Human Resources Officer or the Dean of Students, complaints or allegations should be directed to the President. Any complaint regarding the President should be directed to the Chair of the Board of Trustees. 154 - August 30, 2023 Concerns and complaints may also be registered online here: https://www.lighthouse -services.com/MCPHS/incident - V3-mcphs.asp. When to Report. All reports or complaints should be made as promptly as possible after the occurrence. Mandated Reporters: Although all community members are strongly encouraged to report any conduct that violates this policy, the following individuals have a duty to n otify the Chief Human Resources Officer (Kevin.Dolan@mcphs.edu) or the Dean of Students (Jacinda.FelixHaro@mcphs.edu) promptly upon witnessing, receiving notification of, or otherwise learning of an incident of that may constitute discrimination, harassmen t, or related retaliation that occurred in the course of University employment, educational programs, or activities. All University Officers (i.e., President, Chief Executive Officer, Vice President(s), Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Treasurer, and Assist ant Treasurer); All Deans, Department Heads/Chairs, and Program Directors; The Title IX Coordinator; All employees with managerial or supervisory authority; All employees in Human Resources; and All employees in Public Safety. The failure of a mandated reporter hereunder to report a potential violation promptly to the Chief Human Resources Officer or Dean of Students is, itself, a violation of this Policy, except in the case of an individual whose profession and University responsibilities requires them to keep certain communications confidential (e.g., a professional counselor). Such an individual is not required to report confidential communications received while performing those privileged responsibilities. Right to file criminal complaint . A complai nant has the right to file a criminal complaint regarding any conduct that may constitute a crime at any time before, during or after the University's investigation. Amnesty Policy . The University encourages the reporting of all potential violations of this policy. Sometimes individuals are hesitant to report because they fear being charged with other policy violations. Because the University has a paramount interest in protecting the well-being of its community and remedying Discrimination and Harassm ent, other policy violations will be considered, if necessary, separately from allegations under the Policy and the circumstances under which the other policy violations became known will be considered as a mitigating factor. Confidentiality . The Universi ty will maintain the privacy of the complaint, and the privacy of the persons involved, to the greatest extent possible, consistent with its goal of conducting a thorough and complete investigation and to the extent permitted by law. It is important to un derstand that while the University will treat information it has received with appropriate sensitivity, nonetheless there may be a need to share certain information within the University for the purposes of investigating, stopping, or preventing Discrimina tion and Harassment. Zero-Tolerance for Retaliation. The University will not tolerate retaliation against any employee or student based upon such individual's filing of a complaint of discrimination or harassment or participation in the investigation or adjudication of such a complaint. Retaliation is a serious violation of this policy, as well as of federal, state, and local law. Anyone who believes they are a victim of retaliation should report the matter immediately according to the same procedure prov ided in this policy for making complaints of discrimination or harassment. III. INTERIM MEASURES The Designated Officer, at their discretion, may impose interim measures or provide supportive accommodations while the complaint is pending, which may include, but are not limited to: no contact orders, adjustments to class or work schedules, temporary re assignment, restricting access to certain buildings, temporary suspension, etc. IV. INFORMAL RESOLUTION In certain circumstances, it may be possible for a concern to be resolved through an informal resolution procedure. When the Designated Officer deems appropriate, MCPHS will offer an informal resolution option to the parties, in which the Designated Officer will appoint a neutral third party, who may facilitate a dialogue between the parties or suggest a resolution to the parties, which they may accept or reject. Participation in the informal resolution process is entirely voluntary, and parties may choose to withdraw from the process at any time. If either party elects to withdraw from the informal resolution process, the concern or complaint will be a ddressed through the formal resolution process. However, once both parties have agreed to a resolution, that resolution will be considered final. 155 - August 30, 2023 V. FORMAL RESOLUTION A. Investigation Procedures 1. Initiating the investigation . The Designated Officer will review the allegations and determine whether the alleged conduct could constitute a violation of this policy. If so, the Designated Officer will assign a trained investigator to conduct a prompt, thorough, and impartial inve stigation. The investigator will contact the complainant (the person bringing the complaint) and the respondent (the person who is accused of misconduct) to arrange interviews at the appropriate time. If the Designated Officer determines that the alleg ed conduct is not prohibited by this policy, the Designated Officer may dismiss the complaint or may take steps to address the complaint under a different policy or means. 2. Collecting information . The investigator will conduct prompt, thorough, and imparti al interviews of the complainant, the respondent, and any witnesses. The investigator will review evidence and consider information relevant to the complaint. Throughout the investigation both parties will have an equal opportunity to identify witnesses and provide other information, but the investigator has discretion to determine whether to interview a witness and what evidence is relevant. 3. Standard of proof . The \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard is applied to the investigator's findings to determine whether the respondent is responsible. The standard requires a finding that it is more likely than not that discrimination or harassment occurred in order to assign responsibility to the respondent. 4. Investigation Report . At the conclusion of the investigation, the investigator shall prepare a written report that shall include a statement of factual findings and a recommendation as to whether the evidence supports a finding of a policy violation. 5. Withdrawing a complaint . Prior to the conclusion of a discrimination or harassment investigation, the complainant may withdraw their complaint. Withdrawal of the complaint may end the investigation and resolution process. However, the University reserves the right to proceed with the complaint, even af ter the complainant withdraws it, to protect the interests and safety of the University community, as necessary. 6. Timeframe . An investigation will be concluded within reasonable timeframes and a determination finalized within sixty (60) business days after the commencement of the investigation, absent extenuating circumstances. B. Adjudication Procedures 1. Procedures for Student Respondents1: In cases in which the Respondent is a student, the investigation report will be transmitted to the Dean of Students or their designee. The complaint will be adjudicated, including any appeals, in accordance with the Community Standards System as set forth in the Student Code of Conduct and Community Standards System, which can be found in the MCPHS University Student Hand book (available on the MCPHS website). In the case of a student respondent(s), records will be retained according to policies administered by the Office of the Dean of Students. 2. Procedures for Employee Respondents: In cases in which the Respondent is an e mployee (faculty or staff), the investigation report will be transmitted to the Chief Human Resources Officer or their designee, who may accept the recommendation of the investigator in whole or in part or determine that additional information is needed an d consult with the investigator and/or the parties or request that the same, or another investigator, do further investigation. Once the Chief Human Resources Officer or their designee is satisfied that the investigation is complete, the Chief Human Resou rces Officer or designee will make a finding as to whether the policy was violated and, in consultation with MCPHS Legal Affairs and/or the Respondent's supervisor or program or department head, determine the appropriate remedies. The Chief Human Resource s Officer or their designee will then notify the Complainant and Respondent of the finding to the extent permitted by law. The Complainant will not be notified as to any discipline imposed unless it has a direct impact on the complainant, e.g., a no -conta ct order. 3. Vendor or Visitor Respondents: When the Respondent is a vendor or contractor, the investigation report will be provided to the MCPHS employee responsible for managing the vendor relationship who will take appropriate action in accordance with the vendor contract. When the Respondent is a visitor, the investigation report will be provided to the appropriate MCPHS office depending on the identity of the visitor and the nature of the visit. 1 Some individuals are both students and employees of MCPHS. The University will determine, at its sole discretion, whether th e employee or student procedures should be utilized in a given circumstance. 156 - August 30, 2023 C. Document Retention In all cases, the Designated Officer shall retain records relating to the comp laint for a minimum of three (3) years or for such longer period as (a) the complainant and/or respondent remains employed at MCPHS or (b) any administrative or legal action, arising out of the complaint is pending. All records of discrimination and haras sment and related retaliation reports and investigations shall be considered private and shall not be disclosed publicly except to the extent required by law. VI. COMPLAINTS BY AND AGAINST UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS ARISING IN AN AFFILIATED ENTITY. University employees and students sometimes work or study at the worksite or program of another organization affiliated with MCPHS. When a student or employee involved in an off -site program is alleged to have been subjected to or engaged in conduct that violates this Policy, the conduct should be reported in accordance with the complaint procedures set forth above. The University will investigate and address the alleged violation in coordination with affiliated entity to the extent possible. In circumst ances in which the Respondent is a University employee or student, the complaint will be addressed in accordance with the procedures set forth above. The affiliated entity may also choose to address the alleged violation through its own procedures. VII. ACCOMMODATION The University is committed to fostering an inclusive and accessible community. To that end, and in accordance with federal, state and local law, the University provides reasonable accommodations to qualified students and employees on the basis of: disabi lity; pregnancy, childbirth and related conditions; and religion.

To remain in good academic standing in the Bachelor of Science in Chemistry program, students must maintain a cumulative 2.0 grade point average (GPA) . To progress into the Master of Science program, students must apply at the end of their third year, successfully complete an interview, and have an overall GPA of at least 3.0, as well as a 3.0 or better GPA in all BIO, CHE, MAT, and PHY courses. Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA and get a B or better grade in each graduate level course to remain in good academic standing in the MS program. To meet the residency require ment for the BS, students must complete at least 64 credit hours at the University. All fourth - and fifth -year requirements for the MS degree must be completed at the University. The BS/MS includes both a research project and an internship, ensuring that graduates will be prepared to work in chemical, pharmaceutical, and biotech industry, or pursue a PhD in chemistry or biochemistry. Students must be enrolled for two summers in order to complete the research project. There are two options to complete the research requirement, lab -based research and literature -based research. MS students have the opportunity to be teaching assistants. Students should understand that being a TA takes time from conducting research. If a student chooses to teach, it is not gua ranteed that he/she can graduate on time. Students in the sixth year and beyond should register for CHE 895 Graduate Study Extension (0 Cr) for fall and spring semesters. Students have at most five years to complete the MS program, starting from the fall o f their fourth year when they are admitted to the MS program.

In response to this phenomenon, the four-year Bachelor of Science in Health Psycholo gy program was developed. The Health Psychology major allows students the flexibility to prepare for bachelor -level careers across a variety of health -related and other occupational areas, or for further study in psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, public health, social work, medicine, and other professions. Through a three -course seminar series, students in the Health Psychology program explore career options; identify occupations that best fit their values, skills, and interests; 169 - August 30, 2023 and lear n how to market themselves to potential employers and graduate admission committees. One of only a few in the country, the MCPHS Health Psychology major produces graduates with a range of knowledge in psychology, a strong preparation in the basic sciences and liberal arts, and an informed sense of healthcare issues from other fields such a s sociology, law, ethics, literature, history, and healthcare administration. Students receive training in research methods and statistics. In their last year, Health Psychology majors engage in individually tailored field placements in settings that allow students to apply their knowledge and receive practical experience. Health Psychology majors have the option of choosing one of several minors. These minors develop depth of knowledge in a focal area that complements the interdisciplinary design of the d egree program.

Students who continue their education in public health at the graduate level t ypically pursue careers in epidemiology, biostatistics, health promotion, community health, environmental health, biomedical science, or health policy and management. The curriculum prepares students equally well for advanced studies leading to careers in environmental science, public policy, health promotion, healthcare administration, law, and medicine. The Public Health curriculum builds on general education courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and liberal arts as well as required foundational courses in social and behavioral sciences, biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health, and public policy. In the third and fourth years, students continue with advanced -level courses; select public health electives from the biology, behavioral sciences, and social sciences disciplines; engage in experiential and service learning through a field placeme nt; and design an interdisciplinary project in a senior capstone seminar. Public Health majors have elective openings that permit completion of a minor in Premedical Health Studies, Biology, Chemistry, Health Humanities, Health Psychology, or Women's and Gender Studies, and they have opportunities for language and international studies through the Colleges of the Fenway, as well as travel courses and study abroad through MCPHS University. An additional option also exists whereby students may adopt a Pr e-Health Law concentration. This concentration combines public health with the study of law and will prepare students to sit for the LSAT examination in preparation for law school to obtain the Master of Laws (L.L.M.) or Juris Doctor (J.D.) degrees. To re main in good academic standing, students must maintain a cumulative 2.0 grade point average (GPA) . To meet the residency requirement for the BS in Public Health, students must complete at least 62 credit hours at the University.

Students interested in dental hygiene or medical imaging and therapeutics (diagnostic medical sonography, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine technology, radiation therapy, or radiography) are required to meet technical standards specific to each program. Students should read the technical standards specific to the program they are intere sted in completing. Basic Cardiac Life Support Each student must be certified by an approved Basic Cardiac Life Support for Healthcare Providers course prior to beginning the fall semester of the first clinical year. Certification must remain current thro ughout the program. Licensure The student who successfully completes the academic and clinical components of the Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene, Predental/Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene, or Fast Track Bachelor of Science in Denta l Hygiene program will be eligible to take licensure examinations. Successful completion of the National Board Dental Hygiene Examination and a state or regional clinical examination are necessary for licensure. MCPHS provides 223 - August 30, 2023 education to students in acco rdance with the regulations set forth by the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Dentistry. MCPHS may not be able to provide the education and/or certification necessary for eligibility for licensure in every state jurisdiction. The student is responsib le for determining eligibility requirements for dental hygiene licensure in the jurisdiction in which they plan to practice and to obtain any additional education necessary for licensure in that jurisdiction. Policy for Reentry and Content Validation after Non progression or Leave of Absence Students attempting to return from non -progression in the professional curriculum or leave of absence must be cleared to return to classes by their Academic Dean and the Office of Student Affairs (if a medical leave of absence). Students who are not continuously enrolled in the sequence of undergraduate FSDH professional clinical courses for a period of two semesters or more must validate clinical knowledge and skills before they may reenroll in FSDH professional clinical courses. Validation testing will consist of competency testing to assess clinical and radiography skills related to direct patient care. Program faculty will provide guidance as to what competencies, content, and skills the student needs to review prior to testing , but it is the student's responsibility to prepare for the testing. Students must pass validation testing at a minimum competency level of 75% in order to be eligible to reenter the FSDH professional clinical curriculum. Students may also opt to retake DH Y 209/209L POC 1/Pre -clinic and DHY230/230L Radiology instead of undergoing validation testing. A student who is unable to pass the validation testing at the 75% level will be given the option of retaking DHY 209/209L Process of Care I/Pre -clinic and DHY 230/230L Radiology. If a passing grade is obtained through validation testing or successful completion of DHY 209/209L and DHY 230/230L, the student may reenter the FSDH program on a space - available basis. If the student does not pass the validation test a nd does not reenroll or pass DHY 209/209L and DHY 230/230L, they will be dismissed from the program. Reentry into the FSDH program is subject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: There is no guarantee placement will be available at the student's des ired time of return.) This policy applies to all undergraduate dental hygiene programs. Progression into Professional Phase of the Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene - Boston Accelerated BSDH Students: The minimum passing grade of C in Anatomy and Phy siology (BIO 110 / BIO 210), Chemistry (CHE 110 / CHE 210), and Microbiology (BIO255) and an overall cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.5 are required to progress into the fall of Year II (professional phase) of the program. Predental BSDH Students : The m inimum grade of C in BIO 151, 152, 110, 210, 255 and CHE 131, 132, and an overall cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 is required to progress into the Fall of Year III (professional phase) of the program . Students who achieve the minimum passing grade of C, but do not meet the minimum cumulative GPA for their respective cohort, may enroll in DHY 202 Dental Anatomy and DHY 204 Head and Neck Anatomy in the Year II/III fall semester but may not enroll in other professional courses. If DHY 2 02 and 204 are completed with C or better grades and a minimum cumulative and professional GPA of 2.5/3.0 are attained, the student may progress into the remaining Year II/III fall semester professional courses the following fall semester. This will result in a change in the year of graduation. Students who do not meet the minimum grade and GPA expectations at the end of the first year, or after attempting DHY 202 and DHY 204, will be dismissed from the program. Dismissal from Program Three grades below C in any combination of DHY courses results in dismissal from the program. Progression within the Professional Phase of the Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene To progress within the didactic and clinical phase of the Bachelor of Science in Dental Hyg iene program, students must achieve a final grade of C or better ( > 75%). Obtaining a final grade below C in any professional course results in the student's having to repeat the course. Progression through the program will be delayed (i.e., the student will be on non - progression status) because most professional courses are offered only once per academic year. A dental hygiene student may be placed on non -progression status only once during his or her tenure in the Forsyth Dental Hygiene program. A student who receives a second non progression status in a subsequent semes ter will be dismissed from the dental hygiene program. 224 - August 30, 2023 Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene (Accelerated) The student who begins the Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene program is expected to complete the program in three years. To meet the residency requirement for the BS in Dental Hygiene degree, students must complete at least 60 credit hours at the University.

Students interested in medical imaging and therapeutics (diagnostic medica l sonography, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine technology, radiation therapy, or radiography) are required to meet technical standards specific to each program. Students should read the technical standards specific to the program they are inte rested in completing. School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics Policies and Professional Requirements To be in good academic standing, students in the School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics programs must have a minimum grade point average of 2.5 in professional courses. Students also must earn a minimum grade of C+ in the professional courses in the major, including all clinical internships. Any student who fails a professional course twice is dismissed from the program. Students whose clinical perf ormance during the internship rotation is unsatisfactory receive a warning from their clinical supervisor by the middle of the rotation; those who fail two internship rotations are dismissed from the program. In addition to being in good academic and fin ancial standing, students must complete all professional coursework at MCPHS to receive their degrees in the Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Nuclear Medicine Technology, Radiography, Respiratory Therapy or Radiation Therapy progr ams or the certificate in MRI, Mammography, or CT. BCLS Certification All students in School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics programs must have current certification in Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) for Healthcare Professionals before they begin t 201C). Eligibility for Certification \u2014ARRT Candidates for certification through the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARR T) must successfully complete a program of formal education that is accredited by a mechanism acceptable to the ARRT. Candidates also must comply with the rules of ethics contained in the ARRT Standards of Ethics. These include but are not limited to compl iance with state and federal laws. A conviction or plea of guilty to, or plea of nolo contendere to a crime that is either a felony or a crime of moral turpitude must be investigated by the ARRT in order to determine eligibility. 241 - August 30, 2023 Pregnancy Policy NOTE: This policy applies to a ll female students in the Nuclear Medicine Technology, Mammography and Computed Tomography programs. In the event a female student becomes pregnant, the student may choose to declare her pregnancy, since there is a potential risk to the developing fetus from radiation exposure. In the event a student chooses to declare her pregnancy, the student will noti fy the program director in writing that she is pregnant and also state the estimated date of conception. The MCPHS Declaration of Pregnancy for Radiation Workers form, available in the School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics dean's office, shall be used for this purpose. A copy of this declaration will be forwarded to the Radiation Safety Officer. Choosing not to declare a pregnancy will result in exemption from the specific state radiation protection regulations limiting the exposure to the embryo/fetus . Once the student declares herself to be pregnant, the Radiation Safety Officer will issue to the student a second badge to be worn during the gestation period at waist level to serve as a measure of embryo/fetus exposure. The radiation exposure control criterion for this student will be to limit exposures to this waist -level badge to less than 50 mrem/month (0.5 millisieverts). a copy of the applicable state regulations (105CMR120.203, 105CMR120.218, 105CMR120.267) that deal with exposure to the embryo/f etus a copy of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Guide 8.13, Instruction Concerning Prenatal Radiation Exposure , and Guide 8.29, Instruction Concerning Risks from Radiation Exposure . The student will be given an opportunity to discuss this material with the Radi ation Safety Officer or his or her representative. In order to adhere to Commonwealth of Massachusetts Regulation 105CMR120.218, which requires that \"the dose to an embryo/fetus during the entire pregnancy, due to occupational exposure of a declared pregn ant woman, does not exceed 500 mrem (5 millisieverts),\" the student is offered the following options: The student may continue in the program so long as her embryonic/fetal exposures are in conformance with the requirements of 105CMR120.218. If the student chooses this option, the following procedure must be followed: All efforts must be made by the student to ensure that the total exposure to the waist badge does not exceed 500 mrem (5 millisieverts) for the entire gestation period. The student and program director are to be notified, in writing, by the Radiation Safety Officer, if more than 80% of this dose (400 mrem) is received. The student and program director are to be notified, in writing, by the Radiation Safety Officer if the monthly recommendation of 50 mrem is exceeded. The student is expected to utilize her knowledge of radiation control principles at all times to further minimize her exposure. If the maximum total exposure for the gestation period is reached, the student, Radiation Safety Officer , and program director must agree on an alternate option. The student may request a leave of absence from the career component of the program. The student may continue with general education courses without modification or interruption. The student has the option for withdrawal of the declaration of pregnancy. NOTE: Experience shows that the radiation workers in these programs generally receive to the whole body well below 500 mrem per year, 50 mrem per month, and it is most unlikely that there will be any problems adhering to the fetal exposure limits. Policy for Content Validation after Nonprogression or Leave of Absence Students who have not been continuously attending courses for a period of one semester or more in an undergraduate School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics (SMIT) professional course, or who withdraw from a SMIT program via leave of absence, must validate previous knowledge and skills held prior to program exit before they may reenroll in SMIT professional courses. Reenrollment is su bject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: Students returning from a leave of absence must confirm their intent to return as specified in the Return from Leave of Absence section. There is no guarantee that space will be available at the desired time of return of the student; it may take up to two years for reentry due to lack of clinical placement availability.) This policy applies to all undergraduate SMIT programs. The validation will occur via the student's demonstration of knowledge and skills, such as meeting established program clinical competencies, in a selected clinical facility or simulation laboratory. This requires that students notify the progr am director of the desired date of return a minimum of 30 days prior to the anticipated return in order to make arrangements for preparing and performing validation testing. Program faculty will provide guidance as to what content and skills (competencies) need to be reviewed by students prior to the testing, but it is the student's responsibility t o prepare for the validation testing. Students attempting to return from a leave of absence also must have been cleared to return to classes by the designated 242 - August 30, 2023 staff member in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) and by the Dean of Student s or designee (if a medical leave of absence) prior to performing validation testing. The designated staff member in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment will notify the Dean of SMIT when the student is eligible to take the validation test. Valid ation of knowledge will consist of a competency examination. A minimum grade of C on the competency examination is required. Program faculty will determine the content and skills to be included in the validation test. If a student fails the validation tes t, they must enroll in a one -semester directed study course to remediate prior to reentering the program. This will delay the student's reentry for at least one semester but likely for one year (or more if there is no clinical space available). The number of semester credits assigned to the directed study course will vary (1 - 3 semester credits) depending upon the number of semesters successfully completed in the program. If the student completed two or fewer semesters, 1 credit will be assigned; if three or four semesters, 2 credits; and if more than four semesters, 3 credits. Students may take general education courses concurrently with the directed study but may not take any program professional courses until the directed study has been successfully comple ted. If a student does not pass the directed study with a minimum of C on the first attempt, they will be dismissed from their respective program. Accelerated 32 - to 36-Month Bachelor of Science in Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Nuclear Medicine Technology, and Radiography * The accelerated 32 - to 36 -month Bachelor of Science programs offer degrees in Diagnostic Medical Sonography (DMS), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Nuclear Medicine Technology (NMT), and Radiography (RAD) . The DMS and NMT programs are completed in 36 months, and the MRI, RTT, and RAD programs in 32 months. The Bachelor of Science program integrates didactic instruction in the liberal arts, basic and applied science, and the social sciences with clinical instruction provided by the clinical affiliates. The location of the University in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area, as well as its affiliations with medical institutions located in the Greater Boston area, enable students to train in hospita ls with st ate-of-the-art facilities that are among the best in the world. Students planning to major in one of the Medical Imaging and Therapeutics programs will be expected to specify the program of choice during the formal application process to MCPHS. Students wh o are uncertain about their program of choice are encouraged to complete a shadowing activity for each specialty area in order to decide which discipline they wish to study. If the student has firmly decided on the concentration they wish to pursue, the st udent should contact his or her local hospital to arrange a shadowing opportunity. If such arrangements cannot be made, the MCPHS director for that program will try to accommodate the request to establish a shadowing opportunity. All such requests will be processed on an individual basis based on available space and the specific shadowing requirements at affiliate institutions. Any request to change the major after matriculation to MCPHS will be based on availability of space in the new area of interest. For internal transfers, admission into the desired program is subject to space availability; in addition, the following must be completed: Transcript review by the appropriate program director and the dean of the school A Change of Major form signed by the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment A personal interview with the program director or designated program faculty Clinical observation in which the student will shadow a clinical supervisor in the chosen major; this requirement may be waived at the discretion of the program director Fast Track Bachelor of Science Degrees in Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Nuclear Medicine Technology, Radiation Therapy, and Radiography Designed specifically for students with either an ass ociate or bachelor's degree in another field, these programs of study provide a fast track option for individuals ready for transition to a career in a discipline within medical imaging and therapeutics. Building on previous learning and experience gained from the student's first degree, these programs will mirror the curricula of the three -year Bachelor of Science (or four -year Bachelor of Science in Radiation Therapy) programs previously outlined in the prior section of this catalog. In order to be eligi ble for these programs, students must possess a prior bachelor's or associate's degree, or the appropriate amount of college credits and prerequisites. In addition to the prerequisite coursework, students admitted without a prior bachelor's degree must als o have completed coursework equivalent to the general education core curriculum; transfer and residency credits for these students must total a minimum of 120 credit hours. Students with a bachelor's or associate's degree, or the appropriate amount of col lege credits and prerequisites, may apply to the fast track program. Courses must have been completed at a regionally accredited college or university with a grade of C or better for transfer.

This is necessary to provide a range of diverse learning experiences and to ensure availability and quality of clinical rotation sites. The University makes e very effort to accommodate requests regarding assignments to experiential education sites, but students generally can expect to be assigned to clinical sites at some distance from the campus for at least a portion of their required clinical rotations. In s uch instances, students are responsible for transportation and other related travel expenses. Bachelor of Science in Diagnostic Medical Sonography (Accelerated and Fast Track) General and Echocardiography Tracks (Accelerated, 36 months) The Diagnostic Me dical Sonography (DMS) profession uses high -frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to produce multi - dimensional dynamic images of tissue, organs, and blood flow inside the human body for the diagnosis of various medical conditions. The sonographer, a highly sk illed imaging technologist, uses sophisticated ultrasound equipment to identify disease. In addition, the sonographer works closely with physicians in the processing of the ultrasound images to make a diagnosis. The DMS programs offers a full -time, Accel erated, 36 -month course of study that begins in the fall semester. The comprehensive curriculum includes primary specialties of ultrasound, plus secondary specialties, offered across two tracks; the General ultrasound track, includes training in abdominal, obstetrics/gynecology, breast, pediatric, musculoskeletal and vascular sonography; the Echocardiography track focuses on adult echocardiography with secondary specialty tracks in pediatric echocardiography, and vascular sonography. 244 - August 30, 2023 Technical Standards for DMS Minimum expectations of the DMS programs are to prepare competent, entry -level sonographers in the cognitive (knowledge), psychomotor (skills), and affective (behavior) learning domains in Abdominal sonography - extended and Obstetrics and gynecology sonography.

MRI technologists use their knowledge of anatomy, physiology, patient care, and MRI physical principles to safely ope rate advanced MRI scanners and assist the radiologist in the diagnosis of disease and injury. Unlike most MRI programs, this is a primary pathway program that recognizes MRI as a distinct and separate imaging discipline. Hence, no prior background in a med ical imaging science is required. Admission Technical Standards Technical Standards for Admission, Promotion, and Graduation Candidates for and students enrolled in health sciences professional programs must have abilities and skills in the areas of obs ervation; communication; and motor, intellectual, and behavioral/social attributes. The following technical standards describe the nonacademic qualifications (required in addition to academic standards) that the MRI program considers essential for the succ essful progression in and completion of the educational objectives of its curriculum. Although the MRI program will engage in an interactive process with applicants with disabilities, it reserves the right not to admit any applicant who, upon completion o f the interactive process, cannot meet the technical standards set forth below, with or without reasonable accommodations. Reasonable accommodation for persons with prior documented disabilities will be considered on an individual basis. Students wishing t o request accommodations for disabilities should contact the Director for Office of Student Access and Accommodations. MRI Technical Standards A magnetic resonance technologist provides direct care for patients in hospitals or outpatient facilities and mu st be able to apply acquired knowledge to skillfully perform MRI procedures. These technical standards are based upon the minimum tasks performed by graduates of the program as recommended by the American Society of Radiologic Technologists (www.asrt.org) and the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (www.arrt.org). Listed below are the technical standards that all applicants must meet in order to participate in and successfully complete the MRI program: Sufficient visual acuity to evaluate MR image quality, accurately administer contrast agents, utilize imaging equipment, and provide the necessary patient assessment and care. Sufficient ability to receive and provide verbal communication with patients and members of the healthcare team and to assess the health needs of patients through the use of monitoring devices such as intercom systems, cardiac monitors, respiratory monitors, and systems alarms. Sufficient gross and fine motor coordination to manipulate equipment such as a scan console, power injectors, and various RF receiver coils; in addition, MRI technologists must possess adequate motor coordination to perform venipuncture that is required for many routine MRI procedures. Sufficient communication skills (verbal, reading, writing) to interact with individuals and to communicate their needs promptly and effectively, as may be necessary in the patient's/client's interest. Sufficient intellectual and emotional function to plan and implement patient care 251 - August 30, 2023 Examples of specific technical standards th e MRI student must be able to meet are as follows: Ability to lift, transfer, and/or move patients from wheelchair/stretcher to scan table; dock/release and wheel scan table to/from scan room to patient waiting area. Ability to lift, move, reach, or push MRI equipment (lift MRI coils of up to 35 pounds, push/wheel docking table with patient to/from scan room). Manual dexterity and ability to bend/stretch. Ability to distinguish colors and shades of gray. Ability to endure an eight -hour day with a minimum of four to six hours of standing or walking. Effective interpersonal communication skills in the process of interviewing patients and explaining the procedure verbally and/or in writing. Ability to recognize and be s ensitive to the needs of others Ability to function in a fast -paced environment Ability to read and extract information from the medical chart, patient requisitions, and doctors' orders To perform/assist with MRI procedures on patients, students must initially undergo the same screening procedures as patients, staff, and visitors in order to enter the scan room. The MRI scan room contains a region of intense magnetic field. Objects that d isplay any form of ferromagnetism are therefore of particular concern for MRI. Contraindications for entering the MRI scan room include, and are not limited to certain biomedical implants, materials, and devices (e.g., aneurysm clips, brain clips); certa in electrically, magnetically, and mechanically activated implants and devices (e.g., cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants); and certain metallic foreign objects (e.g., shrapnel, bullets, metal in eyes).

Successful completion of both the theory and the clinical laboratory / practicum in a clinical Nursing course is required to pass the course. A minimum professional grade point average (GPA) of 2.7 is required. All Boston BSN students must achieve a minimum passing grade of 78 (C+) in each professional nursing (NUR) course and in order to progress. A profession al GPA of 2.7 is then required at the end of each semester in order to progress in the nursing major and to fulfill University requirements for graduation. Students who do not achieve the required professional GPA needed to fulfill School of Nursing grad uation requirements must complete a select remediation course(s) to reach the required professional GPA. Official University graduation and approval to write for the NCLEX will not occur until professional GPA and all graduation requirements have been met. Any Nursing course that is graded below a C+ may be repeated only once. A second grade below C+ in the repeated course will result in dismissal from the Nursing program. Throughout the Nursing program, a student may repeat no more than two separate Nursi ng courses. Three grades below C+ in any combination of Nursing courses will result in dismissal from the Nursing program. All courses must be taken sequentially. Professional courses (designated NUR) may not be taken pass/fail. Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS) Students admitted or transferring to the BSN program must successfully complete the ATI TEAS test prior to the transition into the professional nursing curriculum. The ATI TEAS test must be taken before the end of the Summ er Semester for students entering the Professional BSN Curriculum in the Spring Semester. ATI TEAS test results must be reported to the School of Nursing and will be documented in the student's program of study. Students must achieve a score of 65.3 or bet ter within three attempts. Students who do not meet the benchmark score of 65.3 or better within three attempts will be dismissed from the BSN program. 276 - August 30, 2023 Progression and Retention Policies Students must complete the requirements for the BSN degree within five (5) years (32 -month track) or three (3) years (16-month track). If this time limit from the date of admission into the major has elapsed and the student has not completed degree requirements, the student must request an extension in writing and meet with the School Dean, who may approve or deny the extension request. The School Dean's decision is final and not subject to further appeal. CPR Certification All students must complete CPR training prior to beginning clinical experiences in NUR 204: Health and Wellness I. Students must be certified in Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) at the Healthcare Provider Level by the American Heart Association (AHA). Students must provide a copy of the AHA Healthcare Provider Level card indicating active certification. (AHA requires recertification every two years.) It is recommended that the student verify the course in advance to ensure that the course is appropriate. Transportation Reliable transportation to, from, and during all clinical and field experie nces is the responsibility of the student. A number of clinical rotations in the required curriculum may be scheduled at some distance from the campus. This is necessary to provide a range of diverse learning experiences and to ensure availability and qual ity of clinical rotation sites. The University will make every effort to accommodate requests regarding assignments to experiential education sites, but students generally can expect to be assigned to clinical sites some distance from the campus for at lea st a portion of their required clinical rotations. In such instances, students are responsible for transportation and other related travel expenses. Licensure Students who successfully complete the program will be eligible to sit for the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX -RN). Employment Due to the rigorous nature of the Nursing program, the demands placed on students are extremely high, particularly with respect to their clinical schedule and course requirements. It is fo r this reason that students are strongly discouraged from engaging in outside, non -program -related employment throughout the program of study. School of Nursing Professional and Technical Standards A prelicensure candidate for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree must have abilities and skills in four areas: communication, observation, motor function and endurance, and behavioral maturity. Reasonable accommodations may be made for some disabilities. However, prelicensure BSN students must be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner, with or without accommodations.

Reenrollment is subject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: Students returning from a leave of absence must con firm their intent to return as specified in the Return from Leave of Absence section. There is no guarantee that space will be available at the student's desired return date. It may take up to two years for reentry due to lack of clinical placement availab ility.) The validation will occur via the student's demonstration of knowledge and skills \u2014that is, meeting established program clinical competencies \u2014in a selected clinical facility or simulation laboratory. The student must notify the Dean of the desired date of return a minimum of 30 days prior to the anticipated return date to make arrangements for preparing for and performing validation testing. Program faculty will provide guidance as to what content and skills (competencies) the student needs to revi ew prior to the testing, but it is student's responsibility to prepare for the validation testing. The student must pass the validation testing as per the outcome measures determined by the faculty. Failure to meet the required outcome(s) will result in di smissal from the Nursing program and/or the need to repeat identified courses. A student attempting to return from a leave of absence also must have been cleared to return to classes by their Academic Dean or the Student Affairs office at their campus (if a medical leave of absence) prior to performing validation testing. The Student Affairs office and Nursing faculty will coordinate communication regarding student clearance for leave of absence return and subsequent eligibility to schedule validation test ing.

Clinical Rotations Clinical rotations may be scheduled throughout the United States. This geographic diversity is necessary to provide a range of dive rse learning experiences and to ensure availability and quality of clinical rotation sites. Students should expect to be assigned to clinical sites outside of Boston for at least a portion of their required clinical rotations. In such insta nces, students a re responsible for transportation, food, parking, housing, and other related incidentals for all clinical rotations. Students are required to have a 2.85 professional GPA in order to enter into clinical rotations. In addition to the costs of the MPAS -Boston program delineated in the Tuition, Room and Board, Fees section of this catalog, PA students can expect to spend approximately $1,000 on medical equipment and approximately $1,500 for books during the program. Students in the MPAS program will need to complete a Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) check prior to starting rotations. Positive CORI checks may impede or preclude a student's progression in the program and result in a student being ineligible for placement at a clinical rotation and/ or for state licensure as a physician assistant. Students are responsible for the cost of all CORI checks and for knowledge of the licensure requirements of the state(s) in which they intend to seek licensure. School of Physician Assistant Studies Policie s and Professional Requirements Basic and Advanced Life Support All students in the Physician Assistant program must present proof of successful completion of Basic Life Support (BLS) for Healthcare Providers and Advanced Cardiac Life Support courses (ACLS) prior to entry into the clinical year and must maintain this c ertification throughout the remainder of the program. Employment Outside of the University The Physician Assistant curriculum is rigorous and requires many hours of study outside the classroom. Moreover, clinical rotations often require students to be present nights, weekends, and holidays. Therefore, employment while in PA school is strongly di scouraged. Transfer of Credit The MCPHS PA Studies program does not accept transfer credit for any PAS courses during the 30 -month professional PA program. Advanced Placement The MCPHS Physician Assistant Studies program does not award advanced placemen t in its professional PA curriculum.

Failure to achieve a grade point average of 2.7 following the probationary period is grounds for dismissal from the pathway. For a description of the appeal process, refer to the MCPHS U niversity student handbook. The minimum acceptable grade is C - in courses in the pathway. Courses in which grades below passing are earned must be repeated until the minimum grade level is met. A student may petition to replace a maximum of one repeated course grade in his or her calculated grade point average. All coursework must be completed within a period of six years of matriculation into the Non-Traditional Doctor of Pharmacy program. Pharmacy Experiential Rotations Students are required to complete four core rotations in the areas of internal medicine, institutional pharmacy practice, ambulatory care, and community pharmacy practice. These clinical experiences will occur outside of current work duties and after the completion of Phase II of the NTDP program. Students may apply to waive up to three of the four core 4 - week rotations at two time points: once upon admission and once at the start of Phase II of the curriculum. The ability to waive rotations will be based on verified pr ior work experience (minimum 8 weeks of experience in the rotation area), 297 - August 30, 2023 board certification, or other qualifications. The waiver evaluation includes a formalized faculty interview to document competence related to the rotation area. Curriculum: Non-Traditional Doctor of Pharmacy Pathway The current pathway is organized into three phases that provide for progression toward the terminal educational outcomes. Completion of 43 credit hours of coursework is required to receive the degree.

Each graduate program deepens students' understanding in specialized fields of knowledge to prep are them for leadership roles in higher education, industry, government, and healthcare practice. Graduate education is highly individualized with respect to both coursework and research requirements as relevant to the individual programs. MCPHS Universit y requires specific courses relevant to the discipline that enable the student to develop the requisite conceptual and technical competencies needed to initiate meaningful research towards discovery learning. Students also must develop the communication sk ills required to disseminate professional and scientific information. Finally, and most importantly, graduate students are expected to demonstrate an ever -increasing ability to independently identify and resolve significant problems in their areas of speci alization. Participation in Research Research, the experimental portion of graduate education, is the major focus of the course of study in many graduate programs and prepares students for their future careers. For certain programs, the advanced degree is awarded only after the timely completion of a written thesis or dissertation on the student's research. This research must be an original work of a quality that merits publication following critical peer review. Experienced faculty mentors work closely wi th students to guide them in their research and other educational endeavors. 311 - August 30, 2023 Degree Requirements Master of Science The Master of Science (MS) degree is conferred upon graduate students who have mastered the advanced scientific knowledge and/or basic research methodology in their area of specialization and fulfilled the following basic requirements: Successful completion of a minimum of 30 credit hours at the graduate level (PEP students must complete 36 hours). For thesis -based Masters, 6 credit hours of research, a capstone course, or a case study thesis are required, depending on the program . Maintenance of a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 for all coursework taken at the University. Transfer credit is not used in the calculation of the GPA. For thesis Masters, a presentation of an acceptable thesis embodying the results of original research which has been openly defended and approved by the student's Graduate Advisory Committee or dissemination of a case study in the field of study based upon programmatic requirements. Passing a general oral examination covering the major field and the thesis in those programs that require the same. For thesis -based Masters, s pending a minimum of one but no more than three continuous academic years in residence at the University conducting thesis research. All graduate students involved in research continue to register for Graduate Study Extension (PSB 895) until their research is completed and thesis defended. Completion of all requirements for the Maste r of Science degree within a period of four years NOTE: Additional requirements may be established by the individual graduate programs that are included in the program descriptions. The student's individual program of study is planned jointly with their Gr aduate Advisory Committee, which includes at least three graduate faculty members. Specific program requirements supersede general graduate requirements. Doctor of Philosophy The granting of the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree is based on evidence of g eneral proficiency and distinctive attainments in a specialized field, particularly on the demonstrated ability to conduct independent and original investigation. For the PhD degree, the student must complete the following basic requirements: A minimum of 50 credit hours at the graduate level and no less than 4, nor more than 13 credit hours (excluding summers) of doctoral research. A student who has earned a Master of Science degree from another institution must complete a minimum of 40 credit hours at MCPHS in addition to the other requirements of the PhD program. Maintenance of a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 for all coursework taken at the University. Transfer credit is not used in the calculation of the GPA. Successful complet ion of qualifying examinations, both written and oral, in the areas of concentration, prior to the defense of a dissertation proposal. A student has no more than 2 attempts in each of the written and oral qualifying examinations. The comprehensive qualifyi ng examinations are determined and conducted twice per year (January and July). Presentation of a dissertation that is a contribution to knowledge in the major discipline and that has been openly defended and approved by the student's Graduate Advisory Co mmittee Completion of no less than one but no more than five continuous academic years of residence at the University conducting dissertation research. All graduate students involved in research continue to register for Graduate Study Extension (PSB 895) u ntil their research is completed and dissertation defended. From the date of matriculation into the PhD program, completion of all requirements for the PhD must be done within seven years. For students transferring credits from a MS degree in the same area , the completion of all requirements for the PhD must be done within four years from date of matriculation. NOTE: Additional requirements for students who pursue the PhD directly and bypass the MS, may be required to demonstrate a competency in an area rel ated to the major. Individual programs of study are jointly determined by the student and their Graduate Advisory Committee, and specify such requirements. Specific program requirements supersede general graduate requirements. Graduate Advisory Committee For those programs requiring a thesis or dissertation, the Graduate Advisory Committee shall consist of at least three designated graduate faculty members, two from the major discipline and one from a different discipline. Th e Graduate Advisory Committee is recommended by the graduate student and their graduate advisor with the approval of the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies (GRADUATE COMMITTEE APPOINTMENT Form). While graduate faculty are the core of graduate research, the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies can appoint other University faculty or adjunct 312 - August 30, 2023 faculty with unique specialization to serve on Graduate Advisory Committees to provide enrichment to the dissertation research. The advisor is responsible for coordinating the activity of the Graduate Advisory Committee and ensuring compliance with Graduate Studies regulations. The Graduate Advisory Committee (with submitted form) should be appointed within 6 months after a student has chosen their field of specialization (d iscipline), but no later than 18 months after the student matriculates. The student must meet at least once per semester with, and provide written progress reports to, their Graduate Advisory Committee from the time of appointment of the committee until c ompletion of the requirements for the degree. The Associate Dean of Graduate Studies shall be notified in writing of these meetings by the graduate advisor, as well as being provided with copies of the progress reports every December 1st and April 15th until the student has defended their dissertation. More frequent meetings of the Graduate Advisory Committee and the student are encouraged in order to facilitate student -committee interaction. Meetings may be called at the discretion of the student, the advi sor, or if two or more members of the Graduate Advisory Committee request such a meeting. Academic Advising: Graduate Advisory Committee Graduate faculty have responsibility for ensuring that the standards of graduate academic performance are maintained; and to stimulate the development of creative inquiry, professional integrity, and intellectual honesty. Graduate faculty possess the appropriate terminal degree in their discipline; are actively involved in research and scholarly or creative endeavors appr opriate to their discipline; maintain their activities in their graduate discipline by consistently offering graduate coursework and the mentoring of graduate students in their thesis research. While graduate faculty are the core of graduate research, the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies can appoint other University faculty or adjunct faculty with unique specialization to serve on Graduate Advisory Committees to provide enrichment to the thesis research. Admission to Degree Candidacy Formal admission to candidacy occurs when the student, with full graduate status, becomes a candidate for the Master of Science or PhD degree as regulated by the Graduate Council. Such admission requires approval of the student's Advisory Committee, throug h formal application (Petition to Graduate in Graduate Studies form) on or before the dates stipulated by the current University regulations on file with the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. Admission to candidacy depends, among other requirements, upon the maintenance of an overall \"B\" average or higher, and all grades of \"I\" must be removed. The graduate student seeking candidacy for the doctoral degree may do so following the successful completion of the qualifying examinations. The degree requirement s for the PhD programs should be satisfied within two years of satisfactorily completing the qualifying examination and within maximum time limits delineated under Degree Requirements. Change of Program Graduate students should work carefully with their major professors and advisory committees in designing their degree programs. If a change in the degree program is deemed appropriate, it must be approved by the major advisor, the Graduate Advisory Committee, and the Graduate Council, with recommendation to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. Only grades of B or higher may be transferred and used towards total credit count. A change of Program form must be completed. Students are not generally allowed to change programs until completion of at least one academic year (two semesters). Probation and Dismissal Probation Policy The Graduate Academic Standing Committee will recommend a student be placed on probation in their graduate program for unsatisfactory performance in either the classroom or laboratory. Reasons for being placed on probation will include: Failure to achieve a minimum passing grade in either a required or elective course, as specified in the student's program. Failure to achieve and maintain the minimum cumulative GPA as specified in the student's program. Failure to achieve a satisfactory grade in seminar, l ab-rotation, and/or research. NOTE: For students that are on probation but are unable to repeat a required course due to the course being closed or not available in the immediate succeeding term, the student will continue on probation but this will not be considered another violation. Thus, the probation period is extended up to the next available course offering. This is not deemed as lack of demonstrating improvement at the end of the first probationary period. Probationary status is not subject to appeal . Students are expected to complete the corrective action and return to good standing during the next regular semester (i.e. Fall or Spring). 313 - August 30, 2023 Dismissal Policy A graduate student may be dismissed from their graduate program in the following ways: The Grad uate Academic Standing Committee recommends dismissal to the Dean of the School of Pharmacy because: the student failed to return to good standing after being placed on probation for two consecutive terms or; the student's Graduate Advisory Committee recom mends to the Graduate Academic Standing Committee that the student be dismissed because i) the student failed to meet the continuation or progression standards (e.g. PhD student has failed two attempts at either of the oral or written qualifying exams) or; ii) two -thirds of the student's Graduate Advisory Committee members formally vote that the student has not made satisfactory research progress in the program or; iii) the student was unsuccessful in defending their thesis or dissertation. If the Dean of the School of Pharmacy accepts the recommendation of the Graduate Academic Standing Committee, the Dean of the School of Pharmacy shall notify the student of the decision. The Dean of Students may dismiss a student from the graduate progra m for other situations listed in the Student Handbook . A student whose conduct (see Student Code of Conduct in Student Handbook ) is unsatisfactory may be dismissed from the University at any time. In such a case, tuition fees paid for the current academic term will not be refunded. In all cases, the dismissed student will receive written notice of dismissal which will include procedures for appeal, and notice of loss of housing, financial aid, and registration. Written notices will also outline any conditi ons the student should meet in an effort to gain readmission (e.g. taking a specific course and achieving a specific grade). Appeal of a Dismissal Decision based upon recommendation of the student's Graduate Advisory Committee The student may appeal in wr iting to the Dean of the School of Pharmacy who will convene a Faculty Panel to review the appeal and make a recommendation as to the student's appeal to the Dean of the School of Pharmacy. This review should include copies of prior documents of the appeal s process. The student has the right to directly address the Faculty Panel; the Faculty Panel may conduct any enquiry necessary for the review process. The Faculty Panel's recommendation shall be prepared in writing and submitted to the Dean of the School. The recommendation and all documentation is to be retained in the student's file. A negative decision by the Dean may be appealed to the Vice President for Academic Affairs/Provost, whose decision is final. Repeating Courses A student's Graduate Adviso ry Committee may permit the student to repeat a course as long as the successful completion of the course would allow the student to meet the minimum requirement of the program including cumulative GPA and progression. Credit hours from courses that were r epeated are counted only once. A student is not allowed to attempt a course more than twice. Simultaneous Enrollment in another Degree Program Any student currently enrolled in the master's or doctoral degree in the Pharmaceutical Sciences, Pharmaceutic al Business and Administrative Sciences programs at MCPHS may not enroll simultaneously in another undergraduate or graduate degree program at MCPHS or another University or university unless permitted by the Graduate Council. Student Participation in Pro prietary Research When the Faculty of the University are involved in research, some of which may be of a proprietary nature, particular care must be taken to ensure that the need for graduate students to publicly present and defend the results of their thesis or dissertation research is not compromised. Graduate student advisors, and graduate students themselves, therefore, share in the responsibility to ensure that graduate students do not become involved in thesis or dissertation research that is, or ha s the potential to become, proprietary if participation in that research delays completion of their degree requirements or negatively affects their productivity or future employability. The policy of the Division of Graduate Studies and the University is that a faculty member or a graduate student cannot enter into an agreement that prevents or significantly delays the presentation or publication of research results. Journal publication d elays not exceeding a year are acceptable, but publication of PhD dissertation materials through ProQuest is a requirement of the Division of Graduate Studies and thus cannot be delayed. In instances where, despite good faith efforts on the part of the res earch advisor and the graduate student, the graduate student's thesis or dissertation research is later found to be of a proprietary nature, the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies will be notified immediately. The Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, in tur n, immediately convenes a meeting of the graduate student, the research advisor, and members of the student's thesis or dissertation committee. This group, in consultation with the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies resolves the problem. If the situation c annot be resolved through the efforts of this group, a ruling is made by the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. 314 - August 30, 2023 Thesis A thesis contributing new knowledge is required on a topic in the major discipline. Prior to a student being certified as a candidat e for the thesis track MS degree, they submit and defend a research proposal on the proposed topic. Master of Science in Regulatory Affairs and Health Policy and Master of Science in Clinical Research students seeking to enroll in DRA 810 Case Study Thesis must submit a one -page proposal letter for approval by the program director and course faculty. The proposal must comply with the Handbook for the Preparation of Graduate Theses and Dissertations and/or MCPHS University School of Pharmacy Division of Grad uate Studies Handbook for the Preparation of Graduate Theses and Dissertations as amended from time to time. This proposal should show evidence of creative integration of course material, superimposed on a sound understanding of the pertinent literature. T he proposal should be done within six months of choosing their research advisor for Masters' candidates, or six months after successfully completing their qualifying examination, for PhD candidates. Upon approval of the research proposal by the research a dvisor, Graduate Advisory Committee, and the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, the latter, after assessing availability and utilization of resources, will determine if the studen t is certified as a candidate for the thesis track Master of Science or PhD degree. The Graduate Advisory Committee critically reviews the written proposal. The student should understand that the proposal is acceptable only if it is imaginative and provides a scientifically rigorous test of a meaningful hypothesis. The proposal ma y be strengthened with data from preliminary experiments. Within two weeks of the submission of the written proposal to the committee, the student presents and defends the research proposal orally before the committee. The student is questioned on methodol ogies and background areas needed to successfully complete the proposed research. Such admission to candidacy must occur at least six months prior to completing requirements for the degree. The Division of Graduate Studies recognizes that the student's res earch may deviate substantially from that originally proposed. The student should be encouraged to pursue promising leads; however, long -term changes in the direction of the student's research should be in consultation with the Graduate Advisory Committee. Off-campus research is not permitted, except for unusual circumstances that require a portion of the research to be completed off -campus in the continental United States, or for students admitted into an online Master of Science degree program. If such a situation arises, the research advisor, with the written approval of the Graduate Advisory Committee, submits to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies and Graduate Council a written request for permission to conduct the research off -campus. Along with th e request is a letter from the off -campus researcher agreeing to serve as the off - campus mentor and a description of the resources the off -campus site provides. A visit to the off -campus site for the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies (or their designee) a nd the research advisor is arranged once the research commences off -campus. Such permission is not required for students admitted into an online Master of Science degree program. Following approval of the Graduate Advisory Committee that the thesis is ready for defense, one copy of the final draft of the thesis must be available to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies not less than two weeks before a date is set for the student's final examination. After making final corrections, the original and one copy of the thesis, approved by the Graduate Advisory Committee and the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, per requirements of the Library, must be in the Graduate Office two weeks p rior to graduation along with a RECEIPT OF THESIS/DISSERTATION Form. The thesis must comply with the regulations contained in Handbook for the Preparation of Graduate Theses and Dissertations which is Appendix I. Students are responsible for all costs rela ted to preparation of the thesis. Final Examination Each graduate candidate for a thesis -based degree is required to pass a general oral examination defending their thesis/dissertation. This shall begin with a formal presentation with appropriate slides and shall be at least 30 minutes in length for the MS candidate. The examination is conducted by the Graduate Advisory Committee, with the candidate's research advisor presiding as the chairperson. The Graduate Advisory Committee will have primary respons ibility for evaluating the student's research, including the written thesis/dissertation, and the formal oral presentation which is open to the University community. Approval of the final examination by the Graduate Advisory Committee, with no more than o ne dissenting vote, is necessary to recommend the awarding of the degree. The decision of the Graduate Advisory Committee is forwarded to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies (THESIS/DISSERTATION DEFENSE Form). The graduate faculty has the authority, whi ch it has delegated to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, to approve the candidate for the awarding of the degree. Only one opportunity for re -examination shall be given (in not less than three months and not more than one year from the time of the f inal examination at which this decision was made). Any candidate who is granted the privilege of re - examination shall retain the status and obligations of a graduate student until the time of such re -examination. 315 - August 30, 2023 Programs of Study Master of Science in Regulatory Affairs and Health Policy (Boston and Online) The University offers a Master of Science degree in Regulatory Affairs and Health Policy (MS in RAHP), and two graduate certificate programs, one in Regulatory Affairs and the other in Hea lth Policy. The MS in RAHP offers academic training in the law and regulation of healthcare, drugs, devices; and health policy to candidates having attained a prior baccalaureate degree or equivalent professional degree. Candidates for this program are th ose interested in pursuing careers in regulatory affairs, project/product management, clinical development, marketing, quality assurance, quality control, and manufacturing, or with federal or state healthcare regulatory agencies, clinical research organiz ations, managed care, or other health -related fields where knowledge of the regulatory and legal environment is a prerequisite. In addition to the general MS degree requirements described in the MCPHS University course catalog, the program may establish ad ditional requirements. Although the primary emphasis of this program is placed on regulatory affairs, other components such as ethics, policy development, policy analysis, and law are also explored. The program aims to educate a broad range or professiona ls who are interested in developing expertise in regulatory and policy education.

The composition of molecules and their interactions in both a chemical and a physical sense are studied, with the aim of predicting the behavior and properties of new substances. A fundamental understanding of the properties of chemical substances finds application in most frontier areas of biologically re lated scientific research being conducted in industrial, government, and academic laboratories. Programs in chemistry lead to the MS and PhD degrees. Admission to the chemistry graduate programs requires an undergraduate degree in pharmacy, chemistry, or biology that includes two semesters each of general, organic, and analytical chemistry (one semester of which must include instrumental analysis); physical chemistry; calculus; and physics. Students without these prerequisites may be required to complete American Chemical Society proficiency examinations in general, organic, and/or analytical chemistry during the first semester. Medicinal chemistry is concerned with the study of those structural, stereochemical, and physical parameters that affect the bio logical interaction of synthetic and naturally occurring drugs at the molecular level. Research is directed toward a fuller understanding of the pharmacological actions of such substances, leading to improved drug design. Specialization in these programs r equires a broad knowledge of organic and heterocyclic chemistry, pharmacy, spectroscopic instrumentation, and pharmacology. Ongoing research programs include the synthesis and evaluation of antiviral and anticancer drugs, the synthesis of new laser dyes, a nd the isolation and characterization of natural products from plants.

Thesis / Doctor of Philosophy in Pharmaceutics Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) programs in Pharmaceutics are intended to prepare students for positions of responsibility in education, government, and the pharmaceutical industries. The programs are designed to provide an appropriate balance between the theoretical and practical aspects of the area of specialization, which enables the student to b e immediately productive yet prepared for future growth and development. Admission to the pharmaceutics graduate programs requires an undergraduate degree in pharmacy, chemistry, or biology that includes two semesters each of general, organic, and analyti cal chemistry (one semester of which must include instrumental analysis); physical chemistry; calculus; and physics. Holders of undergraduate degrees in nonpharmacy areas are required to complete the following pharmacy courses for no credit: Physical Pharm acy, Dosage Forms, Biopharmaceutics, and Pharmacokinetics. The student is exposed to a broad range of theory and concepts, intended to promote a firm understanding of the materials and technologies associated with pharmaceutical product development, manuf acture, and evaluation. The program encompasses the study of pharmaceutical dosage forms, the release of a drug from the dosage form, drug dissolution, drug absorption, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetics involves the study of the rates of drug absorption, distribution, and elimination, and the quantitative relationship of these rates to drug therapy and/or toxicity. Research projects have typically involved development of new drug products, novel dosage forms, the release of a drug from new dosage forms, preformulation investigation of new drug entities, and pharmacokinetics.

This includes everything from the intermolecular reactions of chem ical compounds within a cell to the evaluation of the effectiveness of a drug in the prevention, treatment, or diagnosis of human disease. Pharmacology offers unique opportunities to contribute to the knowledge, well -being, and survival of mankind. Admiss ion to the Pharmacology graduate program requires an undergraduate degree in pharmacy, chemistry, or biology. While formal training in pharmacology and human physiology at the undergraduate level is helpful, it is not required for admission. Students who a re deficient in these areas are required to audit the undergraduate course sequences in pharmacology / medicinal chemistry and/or physiology. Programs leading to the degrees of Master of Science and PhD are offered for graduate study in pharmacology. Each comprises two major components: (1) coursework in specific disciplines such as pharmacology, physiology, biochemistry, medicinal chemistry, and related disciplines, and (2) training in research and the scientific method. The programs prepare students for positions of leadership and responsibility in academic, industrial, and government settings. Theoretical and experiential situations in which pharmacological information may be applied are provided to help students develop an innovative and creative appro ach to problem solving.

For details on the curriculum, prerequisites, and other information about the MSOT program, refer to the MCPHS University -Manchester School of Occupational Therapy section of th is catalog. The Worcester curriculum will be identical to the existing program located on the Manchester campus. This consists of a total of 84 credit hours and includes approximately 30 -weeks of fieldwork education. The program encompasses five areas of c oncentration: Basic Tenets of Occupational Therapy and Practice (24 credit hours), Foundations of Occupational Therapy Practice (18 credit hours), Scholarship (12 credit hours), Management of Occupational Therapy Services (6 credit hours), and Fieldwork Ed ucation (24 credit hours). 384 - August 30, 2023 MCPHS University -Worcester School of Optometry Nancy Coletta, OD, PhD, Interim Dean; Associate Dean for Academic Programs Greg Waldorf, OD, Associate Dean for Clinical Programs Larry Baitch, OD, PhD, Associate Dean for Research Professors Degree Programs Doctor of Optometry Doctor of Optometry (OD) The Doctor of Optometry (OD) program on the Worcester campus offers a student -oriented, learner -centered program designed to provide graduates with entry level activities to succeed in professional practice. The four -year program uses the latest in instruc tional and clinical technology to assure that its graduates possess the state -of-the-art education necessary to diagnose and manage the wide variety of ocular and systemic conditions encountered in today's diverse clinical settings. The program features cl inically relevant instruction and patient care; dedicated faculty who place a high importance on teaching, advising, and individual student development; and clinical experiences in selected facilities in on-campus and off -campus optometric and ophthalmolog ic clinics as well as Veterans' Administration Centers, community health centers, hospitals, and community agencies in and beyond the Greater Worcester region. Technical Standards In order to fully describe elements required for successful completion of its professional optometric degree program, the MCPHS School of Optometry has adopted guidelines developed and adopted by the Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry (ASCO). All students are expected to demonstrate each of the competencies contain ed within these functional guidelines: Functional Guidelines for Didactic and Clinical Optometric Education at MCPHS University To provide guidance to those considering optometry as a profession, the Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry (ASCO ) has established functional guidelines for optometric education. The ability to meet these guidelines, along with other criteria established by individual optometric institutions, is necessary for graduation from an optometric professional degree program. Our mission is to produce graduates fully qualified to provide quality comprehensive eye care services to the public. To fulfill this mission, each institution must ensure that students demonstrate satisfactory knowledge and skill in the provision of opt ometric care. Admission committees therefore consider a candidate's capacity to function effectively in academic and clinical environments as well as a candidate's academic qualifications and personal attributes. The functional guidelines in optometric ed ucation require that the candidate/student possess appropriate abilities in the following areas: (1) observation; (2) communication; (3) sensory and motor coordination; (4) intellectual -conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities; and (5) behaviora l and social attributes. Each of these areas is described in this document. In any case where a student's abilities in one of these areas are compromised, they must demonstrate alternative means and/or abilities to meet the functional requirements. It is expected that seeking and using such alternative means and/or abilities shall be the responsibility of the student. Upon receipt of the appropriate documentation, the school or college will be expected to provide reasonable assistance and accommodation to the student. 385 - August 30, 2023 Observation Abilities The student must be able to acquire a defined level of required knowledge as presented through lectures, laboratories, demonstrations, patient interaction, and self -study. Acquiring this body of information necessitat es the functional use of visual, auditory, and somatic sensation enhanced by the functional use of other sensory modalities. Examples of these observational skills in which accurate information needs to be extracted in an efficient manner include the following: Visual abilities (as they relate to such things as visual acuity, color vision, and binocularity) : Visualizing and reading information from papers, films, slides, video, and computer displays Observing optical, anatomic, physiologic, and pharmacologic demonstrations and experiments Discriminating microscopic images of tissue and microorganisms Observing a patient and noting nonverbal signs Discriminating numbers, images, and patterns associated with diagnostic tests and instruments Visualizing specific ocular tissues in order to d iscern three -dimensional relationships, depth, and color changes Auditory abilities: Understanding verbal presentations in lecture, laboratory, and patient settings Recognizing and interpreting various sounds associated with laboratory experiments as wel l as diagnostic and therapeutic procedures Tactile abilities: Palpating the eye and related areas to determine the integrity of the underlying structures; Palpating and feeling certain cardiovascular pulses Communication Abilities The student must be able to communicate effectively, efficiently, and sensitively with patients and their families, peers, staff, instructors, and other members of the healthcare team. The student must be able to demonstrate established communication skills using traditional and alternative means. Examples of required communications skills include the following: Relating effectively and sensitively to patients, conveying compassion and empathy; Perceiving verbal and nonverbal communication such as sadness, worry, agitation, and lack of comprehension from patients; Eliciting information from patients and observing changes in mood and activity; Communicating quickly, effectively, and efficiently in oral and written English with patients and other members of the healthcare tea m; Reading and legibly recording observations, test results, and management plans accurately; Completing assignments, patient records, and correspondence accurately and in a timely manner Sensory and Motor Coordination Abilities Students must possess the sensory and motor skills necessary to perform an eye examination, including emergency care. In general, this requires sufficient exteroception sense (touch, pain, temperature), proprioceptive sense (position, pressure, movement, stereognosis, a nd vibration) and fine motor function (significant coordination and manual dexterity using arms, wrists, hands, and fingers). Examples of skills required include, but are not limited to, the following: Instillation of ocular pharmaceutical agents; Inserti on, removal, and manipulation of contact lenses; Assessment of blood pressure and pulse; Removal of foreign objects from the cornea; Simultaneous manipulation of lenses, instruments, and therapeutic agents and devices; Reasonable facility of movement; Injections into the eye, lids, or limbs Intellectual -Conceptual, Integrative, and Quantitative Abilities Problem solving, a most critical skill, is essential for optometric students and must be performed quickly, especially in emergency situations. In or der to be an effective problem solver, the student must be able to accurately and efficiently utilize such abilities as measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, judgment, investigation, memory, numerical recognition, and synthesis. Examples of these abilities include being able to: determine appropriate questions to be asked and clinical tests to be performed; identify and analyze significant findings from history, examination, and other test data; demonstrate good judgment and provide a reasonable assessment, diagnosis, and management of patients; 386 - August 30, 2023 retain, recall, and obtain information in an efficient manner; and identify and communicate the limits of one's knowledge and skill. Behavioral and Social Attributes The student must possess the necessa ry behavioral and social attributes for the study and practice of optometry. Examples of such attributes include the following: Satisfactory emotional health required for full utilization of one's intellectual ability; High ethical standards and integrity; An empathy with patients and concern for their welfare; Commitment to the optometric profession and its standards; Effectiv e interpersonal relationships with patients, peers, and instructors; Professional demeanor; Effective functioning under varying degrees of stress and workload; Adaptability to changing environments and uncertainties; Positive acceptance of suggestions and constructive criticism Candidates with questions or concerns about how their own conditions or disabilities might affect their ability to meet these functional guidelines are encouraged to meet with an admission counselor prior to submitting an application. Admission Prerequis ites Bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited postsecondary institution in the United States strongly recommended; a minimum of 90 credit hours or 135 quarter hours of college education must be completed prior to matriculation; Recommended minimum o verall grade point average (GPA) and prerequisite GPA of 2.9 or better (on a 4.0 scale); Minimum grade of C in all prerequisite courses; Completed Optometry Centralized Application Service (OptomCAS) application; Optometry Admission Test (OAT) report; scor e of 300 or higher recommended or Graduate Record Exam (GRE) report; score of 150 or higher recommended; Two letters of recommendation; one professional and one academic preferred; R\u00e9sum\u00e9; Personal statement (500 to 1,000 words); Evidence of familiarity w ith optometry (shadowing a practitioner, volunteer work in optometric offices, etc.); Official Advanced Placement (AP) or College -Level Examination Program (CLEP) scores, if applicable (transfer credit granted for AP scores of 4 or 5 and CLEP scores of 50 or higher); Official TOEFL (minimum of 213 computer -based or 79 iBT) or IELTS (minimum 6.5) scores for all applicants whose primary language is not English; Official transcripts from non -U.S. secondary schools, colleges, or universities submitted to World Education Services (WES) for a course -by-course evaluation. Prerequisite Coursework: General Biology I and II with labs (8 credit hours) Microbiology with lab (4 credit hours) General Chemistry I and II with labs (8 credit hours) Organic Chemistry with lab (4 credit hours) Physics I and II with labs (8 credit hours) Calculus (3 credit hours) English (6 credit hours) Psychology (3 credit hours) Statistics (3 credit hours) Biochemistry (3 credit hours) (not required but strongly recommended) All math and science prere quisites must have been completed within the last 10 years. Progression and Retention Progression in the Doctor of Optometry program is dependent upon the student's maintaining a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0. To progress within both the didactic and the clinical phases of the program, students must achieve a final course grade of C or better, or a pass for a pass/fail course. In all OPT -designated courses, obtaining a course grade of less than a C 387 - August 30, 2023 or a fail res ults in a student's having to repeat the course, which stops progression through the program (i.e., results in nonprogression status) because OD courses are offered only once a year. The student will decelerate to a class cohort that is targeted to graduat e later than the student's original cohort. An optometry student may be placed on nonprogression status only once during his or her tenure in the School of Optometry (OD) program. A student who receives a second nonprogression status in a subsequent semest er will be dismissed from the optometry program. Directed study during the first three years may be required as remediation in lieu of repeating one year (1) if the student fails one course that is not sequential and/or (2) at the recommendation of the in structor of record and the Academic Standing Committee. The final decision for approval of the directed study requirement during the four -year program will be at the dean's discretion. Students in their fourth professional year who fail a clinical educati on experience may be required to repeat a clinical externship course, or to complete a directed study course (ranging from 1 to 3 credit hours) prior to completing their clinical education experience. Progression is subject to clinical placement availabili ty. (NOTE: There is no guarantee that space will be available at the desired time of return of the student; it may take up to two years for reentry due to lack of clinical placement availability.) If a student is unable to progress in a professional cours e or clinical education experience after two attempts, the student will be referred to the program's Academic Standing Committee with a recommendation for dismissal. Students must complete the requirements for the Doctor of Optometry (OD) degree within fiv e years from initial matriculation. If this time limit in the OD program has elapsed and the student has not completed degree requirements, the student must request an extension in writing and meet with the Dean of the School of Optometry, who may approve or deny the extension request. Final appeals are to the Vice President of Academic Affairs / Provost. Clinical Rotations At a minimum, optometry clinical rotations require background screenings. For additional information, please contact the MCPHS Chief Compliance Officer. CPR Certification All students must complete CPR training prior to beginning clinical experiences in OPT 650 Clinical Optometry. Students must be certified in Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) at the Healthcare Provider Level by the American Heart Association (AHA). Students must provide a copy of the AHA Healthcare Provider Level card indicating active certification. It is recommended that the student verify the course in advance to ensure that the course is appropriate. Transpo rtation/Housing Reliable transportation to, from, and during all clinical experiences is the responsibility of the student. A number of clini cal rotations in all years of the required curriculum may be scheduled at some distance from the campus. This is ne cessary to provide a range of diverse learning experiences and to ensure availability and quality of clinical education sites. The University will make every effort to accommodate requests regarding assignments to experiential education sites, but students generally can expect to be assigned to clinical sites some distance from the campus for at least a portion of their required clinical rotations beginning in the first year. In such instances, students are responsible for transportation and other related t ravel or housing expenses. Employment Due to the rigorous nature of the optometry program, the demands placed on students are extremely high, particularly with respect to their clinical rotation schedule and associated student requirements. It is for this reason that students are strongly discouraged from engaging in any outside, non -program -related employment throughout the program of study.

The curriculum includes the elements of foundational sciences, clinical sciences, evidence -based practice, professional roles and practice issues, healthcare systems, and management competencies in the educational preparation of physical therapists. The coursework is designed to reinforce and build on each element so that the student can synthesize and apply th e learned material to a variety of clinical, research, and management situations. This postbaccalaureate program builds on the knowledge acquired from an undergraduate education and has two components: didactic and clinical. Through the didactic component , students acquire the knowledge and skills and develop the attitudes and professional behaviors needed for physical therapy practice. In the clinical education component, students apply their knowledge, skills, attitudes, and professional behaviors in cli nical settings away from MCPHS. The clinical education component accounts for about one -third of the curriculum. The curriculum for the entry -level Doctor of Physical Therapy program has a total of 122 credit hours with 30 weeks of full-time clinical edu cation. The program is made up of five concentration areas: Foundations of PT Practice (32 credit hours), Evidence in PT Practice (8 credit hours), Professional Issues in PT Practice (8 credit hours), Patient/Client management (40 credit hours), and Clinic al Education (35 credit hours).

Essential Functions The practice of phy sical therapy includes the examination, diagnosis, and treatment of people with physical disabilities, movement dysfunction, and pain. Physical therapists must be prepared to conduct in a timely manner a relevant patient examination, evaluate the results o f this examination, and synthesize these data to establish an accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and plan of care; implement an intervention; and use the process of reexamination to assess patient outcomes. Physical therapists must also possess the skills nece ssary to determine when referral of the patient/client to another healthcare professional is appropriate. Physical therapists must provide evidence that the care that they provide is effective, often through the conduct of clinically based research. Doctor of Physical Therapy students must be able to complete the following: Participation in all required aspects of classroom and laboratory activities; Participation in all required aspects of clinical experience activities; Effective communication with oth er students, instructors, assistive personnel, patients, family members, payors, and other healthcare professionals; Maintenance of a safe environment for other individuals and for oneself, including use of universal precautions; Provision of emergency pat ient care, including but not limited to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); Completion of elements of patient/client management, including examination, evaluation of data, formulation of physical therapy diagnosis and prognosis, intervention, assessment o f outcomes, and record keeping; Completion of specific patient/client interventions and treatments, including patient and family education, application of modalities, therapeutic exercise, and functional training; Clinical agencies may have additional or agency -specific technical standards, which take precedence over MCPHS technical standards. The Commission on Accreditation of Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE) accredits professional physical therapy programs and r equires that graduates of these programs be able to deliver entry -level clinical services. Graduates of entry -level programs are required to possess a broad base of knowledge and skills requisite for the practice of physical therapy. Physical therapists re quire the intellectual -communication , behavioral -social, observational , and motor abilities to meet the standard of practice. Certain disabilities can interfere with a student's ability to complete the program of study and acquire the essential functions necessary for the practice of physical therapy. Reasonable accommodation can be made to compensate for some limitations. Howeve r, those that interfere with patient care or safety, or require the use of an intermediary may be incompatible with independent professional practice. Technical Standards for Physical Therapy Intellectual -Communication Abilities Intellectual skills incl ude the ability to recall and comprehend large amounts of didactic information and to apply this information to the examination, evaluation, and management of routine and complex physical therapy problems. Effective communication skills enable the physical therapist to elicit appropriate information from patients and to effectively explain examination and treatment procedures. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include, but are not limited to, the ability to communicate clearly and in a timely manner with patients, physicians, other health professionals, community or professional groups, and colleagues; report clearly, legibly, and in a timely manner through progress notes in patient charts, reports to physicians, insurance forms, and order forms; respond to such things as a patient calling from behind a curtain, warning calls from anyone, and machine alarms; and participate in group meetings to deliver and receive information and to respond to questions from a variety of sources. Behavioral -Social Attributes Students must demonstrate the ability to practice in a professional and ethical manner and possess the emotional stability to practice in a stressful work environment. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersona l skills, cultural competence, and motivation are all personal attributes associated with the practice of physical therapy. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include, but are not limited to, the ability to recognize and respond appropriately to individuals of all ages; genders; races; and socioeconomic, religious, 393 - August 30, 2023 and cultural backgrounds; cope with the stress of heavy workloads, demanding patients, and life -threatening clinical situations; and recognize and respond appropriate ly to potentially hazardous situations. Observational Skills Observation is one of the key tools that a physical therapist possesses. To gather data on patient/client condition and to appropriately manipulate machinery are critical to being an effective physical therapist. Some of the skills an individual must be ab le to demonstrate include, but are not limited to, the ability to observe and interpret patient movement, skin condition, safety hazards, and changes in appearance; and read and interpret equipment dials; assessment graphs; patient charts; professional li terature; and notes from patients, physicians, and other health professionals. Motor Skills The practice of physical therapy requires that the practitioner possess the ability to perform basic evaluative and therapeutic procedures that require specific physical skills and stamina (e.g., palpation, transfers, gait training). A therapist must be able to use vision and somatic sensation in the evaluation and treatment of patients. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include, but are not limited to, the ability to lift, carry, and push patients (150 pounds) in beds or wheelchairs, heavy equipment, body parts, and patients transferring from bed to chair or mat, or be able to instruct others in the activity, including proper body mecha nics; walk and balance well enough to help patients walk and transfer with or without equipment, and prevent injury to patient and self; palpate anatomical structures and handle injured body parts without causing injury to the subject; exhibit sufficien t manual dexterity to manipulate very small equipment, provide support and resistance as needed through complex exercise movements, perform CPR, manipulate dials, and treat acutely ill patients without disturbing sensitive monitoring instruments and lines; and provide for the patient's safety and well -being in all therapeutic or transporting activities. Professional Behaviors In addition to knowledge and skill acquisition, the process of becoming a professional involves developing competence in professio nal behavior. Students are expected to display professional behavior at all times including during clinical education experiences. This includes displaying a professional demeanor in interactions and boundaries with patients and their families, clinical st aff, peers, faculty, and the public at all times in consideration of their representation of the profession of physical therapy and MCPHS. The 10 requisite professional behaviors are defined below. Any student demonstrating unprofessional behavior will be referred to the PT Professional and Academic Review Committee. Definitions Critical thinking: The ability to question logically, identify, generate, and evaluate elements of logical argument; recognize and differentiate facts, appropriate or faulty inferences, and assumptions; and distinguish relevant from irrelevant information . The ability to ap propriately utilize, analyze, and critically evaluate scientific evidence to develop a logical argument, and to identify and determine the impact of bias on the decision -making process Communication: The ability to communicate effectively (i.e., verbal, no nverbal, reading, writing, and listening) for varied audiences and purposes Problem solving: The ability to recognize and define problems, analyze data, develop and implement solutions, and evaluate outcomes Interpersonal skills: The ability to interact ef fectively with patients, families, colleagues, other healthcare professionals, and the community in a culturally aware manner Responsibility: The ability to be accountable for the outcomes of personal and professional actions and to follow through on commi tments that encompass the profession within the scope of work, community, and social responsibilities Professionalism: The ability to exhibit appropriate professional conduct and to represent the profession effectively while promoting the growth/developmen t of the physical therapy profession Use of constructive feedback: The ability to seek out and identify quality sources of feedback, reflect on and integrate the feedback, and provide meaningful feedback to others Effective use of time and resources: The a bility to manage time and resources effectively to obtain the maximum possible benefit 394 - August 30, 2023 Stress management: The ability to identify sources of stress and to develop and implement effective coping behaviors. This applies to interactions with self, patients/c lients and their families, and members of the healthcare team in work/life scenarios. Commitment to learning: The ability to self -direct learning to include the identification of needs and sources of learning, and to continually seek and apply new knowledg e, behaviors, and skills Adapted from L.B. Kontney, W. May, and..Z.A. Iglarsh. \"Professional Behaviors for the 21st Century.\" Manuscript in progress, University of Wisconsin -Madison Physical Therapy Educational Program, 2010. Academic Standards for the Do ctor of Physical Therapy Program A minimum grade of B - is required for all physical therapy (PTH -designated) courses in the DPT curriculum. Any courses designated as pass/fail must be passed in order to progress with the DPT curriculum. The minimum passi ng grade for all cumulative practical examinations is 80%, or B -. All DPT courses must be taken in the specified sequence of the curriculum. An individual PTH course may be repeated only once. A second failed attempt with a grade below the B - standard wil l result in dismissal from the DPT program. Throughout the DPT program, failure to meet the required minimum standard (B -) in more than two separate DPT courses will result in dismissal from the DPT program. A physical therapy student may be placed on no nprogression status only once during his or her tenure in the Physical Therapy DPT program. A student who receives a second nonprogression status in a subsequent semester will be dismissed from the Physical Therapy program. Progression and Retention Progr ession in the DPT program is dependent upon the student's maintaining a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a semester GPA of 3.0 as the student progresses. To progress within both the didactic and the clinical phases of the program, s tudents must achieve a final course grade of B- or better, or a pass for a pass/fail course. A student must be in good academic standing with a professional cumulative GPA of 3.0 to progress to full time clinical education experiences (PTHC 700). In all P TH-designated courses, obtaining a course grade of less than a B - or a fail results in a student's having to repeat the course, which stops progression through the program (i.e., results in nonprogression status) because DPT courses are offered only once a year. The student will decelerate to a class cohort that is targeted to graduate later than the student's original cohort. Students who fail a professional course are required to repeat the course prior to progressing in the curriculum. Students who fail a clinical education experience may be required to complete PTH 685 prior to completing the clinical education experience. Progression is subject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: There is no guarantee that space will be available at the desi red time of return of the student; it may take up to two years for reentry due to lack of clinical placement availability.) If a student is unable to progress in a professional course or clinical education after two attempts, the student will be referred to the School of Physical Therapy Academic Standing Committee with a recommendation for dismissal. Students must complete the requirements for the DPT degree within five years from initial matriculation. If this time limit in the DPT program has elapsed an d the student has not completed degree requirements, the student must request an extension in writing and meet with the Director of the School of Physical Therapy, who may approve or deny the extension request. Final appeals are to the Vice President of Ac ademic Affairs/Provost. Students must be in good academic standing with a professional cumulative GPA of 3.0 to be eligible for graduation. Policy for Reentry and Content Validation after Nonprogression or Leave of Absence Students who are not continuousl y enrolled in the sequence of the DPT curriculum for a period of one semester or more, or who withdraw from the DPT program via leave of absence, must validate previous knowledge and skills held prior to program exit before they may reenroll in any DPT cou rses. Reenrollment is subject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: There is no guarantee that space will be available at the desired time of return of the student; it may take up to two years for reentry due to lack of clinical placement availability .) In order to ensure that all students are competent and safe in the delivery and application of patient care, any student who has not been continuously enrolled must, at the discretion of the faculty, demonstrate identified clinical competency. The val idation will occur via the student's demonstration of knowledge and skills, that is, meeting established program clinical competencies. The student must notify the Director of the School of Physical Therapy by March 1 for fall start, February 1 for May sta rt, and October 1 for January start to make arrangements for preparing for and performing validation testing. Students attempting to return from a leave of absence must also be cleared to return to classes by designated staff in the Center for Academic Suc cess and Enrichment and the Dean of Students (if a medical leave of absence) prior to performing validation testing. The Center for Academic Success and Enrichment will notify the Director of the School of Physical Therapy when the student is eligible to t ake the validation test. 395 - August 30, 2023 School of Physical Therapy faculty will provide guidance as to the content and skills (competencies) to be reviewed by the student prior to the testing. The validation testing consists of testing to assess knowledge and clinical s kills taught prior to the semester of anticipated reentry. It is the student's responsibility to prepare for the validation testing. If a student fails the validation test, they must enroll in a directed study to remediate, followed by a second validation test, prior to reentering the program. Students must pass the validation testing with a minimum grade of B -, at the 80% level, in order to reenter the DPT curriculum. Failure to pass the second validation test after a directed study will result in dismissa l from the Physical Therapy program. The number of semester credits assigned to the directed study course will vary (1 -3 semester credits) depending upon the number of semesters successfully completed in the program. If the student completed two or fewer semesters, 1 credit will be assigned; if three or four semesters, 2 credits; and if more than four semesters, 3 credits. Students may not take any program professional courses until the directed study and content validation testing has been successfully completed.

A cumulative professional GPA of less than 1.70 with no F grades at the completion of any semester results in non - progression. A cumulative professional GPA of 1.70 or less and one or more F gr ades at the completion of any semester results in academic dismissal from the program. All progression evaluations will be based on the student's cumulative professional GPA. Academic Complaint Policy for the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) It is the policy of MCPHS and the School of Pharmacy -Worcester/Manchester (SOP -W/M) to objectively review student grievances related to academic and non -academic issues. If a student wishes to file a complaint relating to the Doctor of Pharmacy pro gram's adherence to Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) standards for accreditation, they may do so using either of the procedures that follow. Internal Procedure The student must file a written complaint with the Dean of SOP -W/M. The Dean will forward the complaint to an ad hoc committee of three faculty with representatives from the Department of Pharmacy Practice and the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences. The ad hoc committee will review the complaint and render a d ecision concerning the complaint. The committee will inform the student of its decision via a written response within 30 working days upon receipt of the complaint. If the student wishes to appeal the committee's decision, then the student must file a wri tten appeal to the Dean within 5 working days upon receipt of the written response from the committee. The Dean will review the appeal and render a written response to the student within 14 working days upon receipt of the student's written appeal. The de cision of the dean is final. The Office of the Dean will maintain a copy of all written correspondence. ACPE Procedure If a student wishes to file a complaint with the ACPE, the student should contact the Council via email, phone, or mail. The ACPE con tact information is available in the catalog in the Introduction section under Accreditation. 403 - August 30, 2023 Electives Electives allow students to broaden their knowledge or deepen their understanding in a specific area of interest thus fostering their personal and pro fessional development.

Transfer Policy A transfer student is any student who 1) was or is enrolled in an ACPE -accredited Doctor of Pharmacy degree program and 2) seeks to apply credits from that program to the SOP -W/M Doctor of Pharmacy program. Due to the highly integrated and sequential nature of the didactic and experiential components of the SOP -W/M Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum, the School will consider requests for transfer of credits only on a case -by-case basis. Because curricula in Doctor of Pharmacy programs vary greatly, students might not transfer at the same level achieved in the previous program. Transfer applicants will only be admitted as an incoming professional first -year (P1) student. Acceptance of transfer students is dependent upon the applicant's qualifications, the curricular compatibility of prior coursework to the required SOP -W/M Doctor of Pharmacy coursework, and space availability in the SOP -W/M Doctor of Pharmacy program. Appl ication of transfer credit may require passing a competency exam. Consideration will only be given to students who are in good academic, professional, and ethical standing at an ACPE - accredited School of Pharmacy. Applicants must meet the same prerequisi tes and requirements applied to all SOP -W/M Doctor of Pharmacy applicants and provide legitimate reasons for seeking transfer. Credits accepted for transfer must have been awarded from an ACPE -accredited school of pharmacy within the year prior to matricul ation into the SOP - W/M Doctor of Pharmacy program. The SOP -W/M will review transfer applicants through submission of a complete PharmCAS application. Applicants seeking transfer must also submit the following supplemental documentation. A letter from the Dean of the Doctor of Pharmacy program in which the applicant is/was enrolled. The letter must summarize the applicant's credentials and verify that the applicant is in good academic, professional, and ethical standing and is eligible to continue in or re turn to that program. A formal request for transfer outlining circumstances for seeking a transfer. SOP -W/M may request a syllabus for each pharmacy course completed in the current/previous Doctor of Pharmacy program. Applicants should not submit course s yllabi unless requested. Decisions on transfer applications are made by the SOP - W/M Admissions Committee. This committee may also seek consultation with the SOP -W/M Curriculum Committee. All applicants are reviewed in the same holistic manner regardles s of whether or not they are transfer applicants. Qualified transfer applicants must participate in the School's formal interview process.

Douglas Simmons, PhD, OTR/L, FAOTA, FNAP , Program Director and Professor Assistant Professor Olivia Freeman, MA, OTR/L, Academic Fieldwork Coordinator and Assistant Professor Professor Simmons; Assistant Professors Amero, Butler, Freeman, Robertson Degree Program Master of Science in Occupational Therapy Master of Science in Occupational Therapy The Master of Science Occupational Therapy Program (MSOT) on the MCPHS Manchester campus prepares graduates with the advanced knowledge and skills for contemporary occupational therapy practice. The curriculum includes foundational arts and sciences, basic tenets and theoretical perspectives of occupational therapy, clinical sciences, service delivery and management, professional responsibilities and ethics, and scholarship competencies in the educational preparation of occupational therapists. The coursewo rk is designed to reinforce and build on required elements that allow students to acquire, synthesize, analyze and apply knowledge and skills in a variety of clinical, community -based, research and management environments. The MSOT program builds on the k nowledge acquired from an undergraduate arts or science education and has two components: didactic and fieldwork education. Through the didactic component, students gain knowledge and skills and develop professional behavior required for occupational thera py practice. Through fieldwork education students apply knowledge, skills, and professional behavior in clinical, school, and community -based settings both at MCPHS and off -campus. Fieldwork education accounts for about one half of the curriculum. The cur riculum for the MSOT has a total of 84 credit hours with approximately 30 weeks of fieldwork education. The program consists of five areas of concentration: Basic Tenets of Occupational Therapy Theory and Practice (24 credit hours), Foundations of Occupati onal Practice (18 credit hours), Scholarship (12 credit hours), Management of Occupational Services (6 credit hours), and Fieldwork Education (24 credit hours). Admission Prerequisites Baccalaureate degree from an accredited postsecondary institution. Off icial transcripts from all colleges or universities attended. Minimum overall grade point average of 3.0 or better on a 4.0 scale. Minimum prerequisite 3.0 GPA on a 4.0 scale. Three letters of recommendation Resume Personal Essay (Why You Selected Occupational Therapy as Your Profession) Official TOEFL (minimum of 213 computer -based or 79 iBT) or ELTS (minimum 6.5) scores for all applicants whose primary language is not English Official transcripts for international colleges or universities must be submitted to the Center for Educational Documentation (CED), Educational Credential Evaluators, Inc.

Essential Functions The practice of occupational therapy includes the examination, d iagnosis, and treatment of people with physical disabilities, movement dysfunction, pain, and mental health disorders. Occupational therapists must be prepared to conduct in a timely manner a relevant patient examination, evaluate the results of this exam ination and synthesize these data to establish an accurate occupational diagnosis/profile, prognosis and plan of care, implement an intervention and use the process of re -examination to assess patient outcomes. Occupational therapists must also possess th e skills necessary to determine when referral of the patient/client to another healthcare professional is appropriate. Occupational therapists must provide evidence that the care that they provide is effective, often through the conduct of clinically base d research. Master of Science in Occupational Therapy students must be able to complete the following: Participation in all required aspects of classroom and laboratory activities; Participation in all required aspects of both level one and level two fieldwork experience activities; Effective communications with other students, instructors, assistive personnel, patients/clients, family members, payors, and other health care professio ns; Maintenance of a safe environment for other individuals and for oneself, including use of universal precautions; Completion of elements of patient/client management, including examination, evaluation of data, formulation of occupational diagnosis and p rognosis, intervention, assessment of outcomes, and record keeping; Completion of specific patient/client interventions and treatments, including patient and family education, occupation -focused activities, application of modalities, therapeutic exercise, and functional skill training. Fieldwork agencies may have additional or agency -specific technical standards, which take precedence over MCPHS technical standards. The Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) accredits professional occupational therapy programs and requires that graduates of these programs be able to deliver entry -level generalist clinical services. Graduates of entry -level programs are required to possess a broad base of knowledge and skills requisite for the practice of occupational therapy. Occupational therapists require the intellectual -communication, behavioral -social, observational, and motor abilities to meet the standard of practice. Certain disabilities can interfere with a student's ability to complete the program of study and acquire the essential functions necessary for the practice of occupational therapy. Reasonable accommodation can be made to compensate for some limitations. However, those that interfere with patient/client care, safet y or require the use of an intermediary may be incompatible with independent professional practice. Technical Standards for Occupational Therapy Intellectual and Communication Skills Intellectual skills include the ability to recall and comprehend large a mounts of didactic information and to apply this information to the examination, evaluation, and management of intervention with patients/clients who have complex occupational performance problems. Effective communication skills enable the occupational the rapist to elicit appropriate information from patients/clients and to effectively explain assessment and intervention processes and procedures. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include, but are not limited to, the ability to: Communicate clearly and in a timely manner with patients/clients, families and care providers, physicians and other health professionals, community and professional groups, and colleagues; Document clearly, and in a timely manner in patient/client records, r eports to physicians, insurance reports, and order forms; Respond to emergency situations; Participate in group meetings to deliver and receive information and to respond to questions from a variety of sources. Behavioral and Social Attributes Students mu st demonstrate the ability to practice in a professional and ethical manner and possess the emotional maturity to practice in a stressful work environment. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, cultural competence, and motivation are all personal attributes associated with the practice of occupational therapy. 418 - August 30, 2023 Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include but are not limited to the ability to: Recognize and respond appropriately to individuals of all ages, genders, ethnicities, socio -economic, religious, and cultural backgrounds; Cope with the stress of heavy workloads, demanding patients/clients, and life -threatening clinical situations; Recogn ize and respond appropriately to potentially hazardous situations. Observational Skills Observation is integral to effective occupational therapy practice. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include but are not limited to the abi lity to: Observe and interpret patient/client participation in a wide variety of occupations applying a broad range of biopsychosocial knowledge and perspectives; Read and interpret patient/client records, specialized equipment, patient/client assessment d ata, professional literature, and notes from patients/clients, physicians, and other health professionals. Motor Skills The practice of occupational therapy requires that practitioners possess the ability to perform evaluative and therapeutic procedures, requiring specific physical skills and stamina. An occupational therapist must be able to use vision and somatic sensation in the evaluation and treatment of patients/clients. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include but are not limited to the ability to: Lift, carry, and push patients (150 lbs.) in bed or wheelchairs, heavy equipment, and patients/clients transferring from one surface to another using proper body mechanics; Walk and balance well enough to help patients/clients w alk and transfer with or without equipment, and prevent injury to patient/client and self; Exhibit sufficient manual dexterity to manipulate small equipment, provide support and resistance as needed during the performance of complex occupations, perform CP R (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), and treat acutely ill patients without disturbing sensitive monitoring instruments and lines; Provide for patient/client's safety and well -being in all intervention activities. Accreditation The entry -level occupationa l therapy master's degree program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA), located at 6116 Executive Boulevard, Suite 200, North Bethesda, MD 20852 -4929. telephone number c/o web address is www.acoteonline.org and email is accred@aota.org. Graduates of the program will be eligible to sit for the national certification examination for the occupational therapist administered by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT). After successful completion of the exam, the i ndividual will be an Occupational Therapist Registered (OTR). In addition, all states require licensure in order to practice; however, state licenses are usually based on the results of the NBCOT Certification Examination. Note that a felony conviction may affect a graduate's ability to sit for the NBCOT certification examination or attain state licensure. This program is approved by the Division of Higher Education -Higher Education Commission, Department of Education State of New Hampshire.

Manchester Admission Office Admissions.manchester@mcphs.edu 603.314.1701 Worcester Admission Office Admissions.worcester@mcphs.edu 508.373.5607 419 - August 30, 2023 Professional Behaviors In addition to knowledge and skill acquisition, the process of becoming a professional invo lves developing competence in professional behavior. Students are expected to always display professional behavior including during fieldwork experiences. This includes displaying a professional demeanor in interactions and boundaries with patients/clients and their families, clinical/school/healthcare staff, peers, faculty and the public always in consideration of their representation of the profession of occupational therapy and MCPHS University. Academic Standards, Progression and Retention All credits in the degree must be obtained in the MCPHS program. The Master of Science in Occupational Therapy (MSOT) does not award credits for prior experiential learning and/or credits by examination. The academic progress of each student will be reviewed at th e end of each academic semester. Progression in the MSOT program is dependent on the student's maintaining a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a semester GPA of 3.0 in all MSOT courses. To progress in the didactic phases of the prog ram, students must achieve a final course grade of B - or better. To progress within the clinical phases of the program students must obtain a pass (P) score on Level I experiences and obtain a minimal score of 122 on the American Occupational Therapy Asso ciation Fieldwork Performance Evaluation for the Occupational Therapist for Level II Fieldwork experiences. In all MSOT courses, obtaining one course grade lower than a B - results in a student having to develop a remediation plan associated with OTH 685 Directed Study in Occupational Therapy. The student will take this remediation course in conjunction with other courses to remain in sequence. A student may only take OTH 685 once to remediate a grade below B -. If a student obtains another course gra de below a B - this course(s) must be repeated, which stops progression in the program. The student is placed into a non -progression status as MSOT courses are offered only once per year. The student will be placed into a cohort that is targeted to graduat e later than the students' original cohort. Students may be placed into a non -progression status once; a student who receives a second non -progression in a subsequent semester will be recommended for dismissal from the MSOT program. Students who receiv e a failing fieldwork grade on the American Occupational Therapy Association Fieldwork Performance Evaluation for the Occupational Therapists (below 122) or are requested to leave a fieldwork site prior to completion will need to arrange with the AFWC (Aca demic Fieldwork Coordinator) to complete another fieldwork rotation at another site. The timing of this clinical rotation cannot be guaranteed to follow program sequence and may result in a later graduation date. Failure or dismissal from 2 fieldwork rot ations will result in dismissal from the program. Level II fieldwork must be completed within 2 years of completion of all coursework that is prerequisite to fieldwork. If a student is unable to progress in the didactic portion or the fieldwork portion o f the program, the student will be referred to the School of Occupational Therapy Academic Standing Committee with a recommendation for dismissal. Final appeals are to the Vice President of Academic Affairs/Provost. If there is a disruption in the sequen ce of the MSOT curriculum by a student for a period of one semester or more, or a student has a leave of absence, the student must validate previous knowledge and skills from previous didactic and fieldwork experiences to ensure that they are competent and safe in the delivery and application of patient care. (NOTE: There is no guarantee that fieldwork space for Level I and Level II fieldwork experience can be maintained, it could take a year or more for reentry due to lack of clinical placement availabilit y.)

CASPA, the centralized national application service of the Association of the Physician Assistant Programs, may be co ntacted at www.caspaonline.org. About the Program In 2002, MCPHS acquired the Notre Dame College (New Hampshire) PA program that had been first accredited in 1998 and enrolled its first class in 1999. MCPHS -Manchester graduated its first class of Master o f Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS) students in December 2002. While based on the Manchester campus, the program has a satellite on the MCPHS -Worcester campus with an identical curriculum \u2014both delivered with faculty on each campus via use of synchronized distance education. For both campuses, the first year is dedicated to didactic and laboratory learning and the second to supervised clinical practice experiences (SCPE) or clinical rotations in a variety of patient -care settings. Students attend classes at their respective campus, with didactic courses simultaneously de livered at both campuses using technologically sophisticated interactive videoconferencing. This technology allows students at each site to interact with other students and faculty members in real time. Laboratory courses and small -group activities are facilitated by Physician Assistant Studies faculty located on each campus. 422 - August 30, 2023 Technical Standards for the Master of Physician Assistant Studies Observation Candidates and students must have sufficient capacity to observe in the lecture hall, laboratory, and diagnostic and treatment areas of outpatient and inpatient settings.

Prerequisite COURSE CREDIT HOURS Anatomy and Physiology (with labs) 8 General Chemistry (with lab) 4 Organic Chemistry (with lab) 4 Biochemistry (with lab) 3 Microbiology (with lab) 4 Statistics 3 Introduction to Psychology 3 Recommended only: Immunology 3 Recommended only: Genetics 4 Prerequisite Policy Seven prerequisites (as indicated in the previous section) must have been completed at a regionally accredited college or university no more th an 10 years prior to the anticipated date of matriculation to MCPHS. For example, for matriculation into the class starting in January 2012, the seven courses must have been completed since January 2002. All prerequisite coursework must have been completed with a final grade of C or better. The number of times a course has been taken to achieve a passing grade will be considered. Prerequisite coursework taken at a four -year institution is preferred. If prerequisite coursework was completed more than 10 yea rs prior, the candidate should submit a letter of request to the PA Program Admission Committee in care of the campus Admission Office. The formal letter must include when and where the course was taken, the grade received in the course, and the rationale for requesting the exception. A current r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and copies of transcripts supporting the applicant's argument must be included. 423 - August 30, 2023 While previous healthcare experience is not required, the majority of applicants have obtained a year or more of direct patient care experience. In addition, job shadowing of a practicing physician assistant for a minimum of 50 hours is strongly recommended. PA shadowing information should be included on the CASPA application under Related Healthcare Experience. This program is a vailable only to applicants who have already earned a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution in any field, and who have fulfilled the prerequisite course requirements. Prerequisites include the following: An earned bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university with an overall cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale; 250-500 hours of patient care experience (recommended); Physician Assistant shadowing experience, leadership ex perience, research experience, volunteer experience (recommended); A minimum TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score for all candidates for whom English is not the primary language (see International Applicants in the Admission section for deta ils); Ability to fulfill the technical standards for admission, promotion, and graduation; Other requirements for international students as outlined in the Admission section School of Physician Assistant Studies Policies and Professional Requirements ( Manchester/Worcester) Students who are enrolled in the program must earn grades of C (2.0) or better in all didactic and clinical year courses and maintain an overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 to remain in good academic standing in the program. Stud ents are expected to understand and adhere to the codes and standards of the profession and to exhibit professional behavior. Students who receive below a C in a didactic course will be required to repeat the course before progressing to the next semester . This will result in a delay of one year to complete the program. Such repetitions will lengthen the program beyond two years and delay graduation (please see Program Completion Policy). Failure to achieve a cumulative 3.0 GPA at the end of the first seme ster of the didactic year results in being placed on probation. If the student does not demonstrate improvement by the end of the second semester of the didactic year, the student may be dismissed from the program. If the student does not achieve a cumulat ive GPA of 3.0 by the end of the didactic year, the student will be dismissed from the program. Students are required to be in good academic standing to enter the clinical year. Students must receive a 3.0 cumulative GPA in order to enter the clinical yea r. Students who receive a grade below a \"C\" in a supervised clinical practice experience course (SCPE) will be required to repeat the SCPE at the end of the clinical year. Such repetitions will lengthen the program beyond two years and delay graduation (pl ease see Program Completion Policy). If a student receives a grade below a \"C\" in a repeated SCPE OR in more than one SCPE course this may result in being dismissed from the program. It is expected that students on academic probation make progress toward g ood academic standing. Failure to demonstrate progress toward good academic standing may result in dismissal from the PA Program. At the conclusion of the second consecutive SCPE, the student must have achieved good academic standing. Failure to do so may result in dismissal from the program. Professional Responsibilities Physician Assistants (PAs) are skilled members of the healthcare team qualified by academic and clinical experience to provide a broad range of healthcare services under the supervision o f a licensed physician. The healthcare services that PAs provide include performing appropriate medical interviews and physical examinations, identifying healthcare problems in need of evaluation and management, screening results of laboratory diagnostic s tudies, implementing treatment plans, counseling patients regarding illness and health -risk behaviors, monitoring responses to physician - directed programs of therapy, and facilitating access to appropriate healthcare resources. These services may be provid ed to individuals of any age in those various settings considered part of the physician's practice. Professional Credentials Over the past 30 years, several milestones within the profession have become markers by which the appropriately trained physician assistant is identified. These markers include graduation from an academic program accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant, certification through examination by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA), and registration or licensure by state boards of medical examiners. Continued professional competence is evidenced by the completion of 100 hours of continuing medical education every two years and successful passage of a rec ertification examination as required by NCCPA.

It is during this phase of training that students apply and improve their clinical and patient management skills. There are 9 required clinical rotations. Each rotation is 5 weeks in duration. In addition to clinical rotations, students participate in on -campus professional seminars during the clinical phase of training. The program has clinical affiliations with a variety of clinical s ites in the North East and Mid -Atlantic regions. Additional national and international clinical sites are also available. Learning experiences occur in ambulatory and hospital -based settings and include rural, suburban and urban clinical sites. Students ar e encouraged to choose rural health facilities for a portion of their clinical experience. The breadth of clinical settings offers the future Physician Assistant the abilit y to acquire skills and competencies practices in a variety of settings. Rotations in the required curriculum may be scheduled at some distance from the campus. This is necessary to provide a range of diverse learning experiences and ensure availability and quality of clinical rotation sites. Students are responsible for providing their own housing and transportation to and from the clinical sites and campus. Housing and travel costs for the clinical year vary widely depending on the site and location. Physician Assistant students are not responsible for identifying or arranging their own clinical sites. However, the possibility exists for students to coordinate, with the program out -of-network clinical sites. To ensure quality educational training the sites must be approved by the Physician Assistant Studies Program and University and pro per protocol must be followed to arrange for out - of-network clinical rotations. The School of Physician Assistant Studies reserves the right to make changes to all policies and procedures at any time. 426 - August 30, 2023 MCPHS University -Manchester School of Pharmacy -Worcester/Manchester Paul Belliveau, PharmD, Professor and Dean Abir Kanaan, PharmD, Professor and Associate Dean for Professional Education t Cheryl Abel, PharmD, Professor and Assistant Dean of Pharmacy Academic Affairs and Operations Kristine Willett, PharmD, Professor and Assistant Dean of Student Engagement & Success Michael Steinberg, PharmD, Professor and Assistant Dean of Assessment Kaelen Dunican, Professor and Assistant Dean of Interprofessional Education Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Terrick Andey, PhD, Associate Professor and Chair Professors Acquaah Friel, Goldsmith, Kaplita, Sharma; Associate Professors Assistant Professors Mandela, Metcalf; Faculty Associates Graham, Pollano Department of Pharmacy Practice Sheila Seed, PharmD, MPH Professor and Chair Professors Abel, Bartlett, Belliveau, Cooper, Dunican, Kanaan, Pervanas, Seed, Silva, Spooner, Experiential Education Paul DiFrancesco, EdD, MPA, RPh Associate Professor and Associate D ean of Experiential Education, Boston/Worcester/Manchester Kara Bonaceto, PharmD, Associate Professor of Pharmacy Practice and Director of Experiential Education Nicole Carace, PharmD, MS, Assistant Professor of Pharmacy Practice and Experiential Education Coordinator Gretchen Jehle, PharmD, Associate Professor of Pharmacy Practice and Experiential Education Coordinator Brianne Morin, PharmD, Assistant Professor of Pharmacy Practice and Experiential Education Coordinator Degree and Certificate Programs Doctor of Pharmacy (Accelerated) Graduate Certificate in Medication Safety* Doctor of Pharmacy (Accelerated)/ Master of Public Health* Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy and Life Sciences Overview MCPHS -Manchester offers programs in Pharmacy in conjunction with the School of Pharmacy -Worcester.
