Etiology of hemorrhoids may be increased straining, hypertension, obesity or pregnancy [2]. In Sri Lanka, decoction of Cyathula prostrata Linn Rath-Karalheba), which belong to the plant family Amaranthaceae is widely used to stop the bleeding of patients suffering from hemorrhoids. C. prostrata is a decumbent herb to 1 m, branched from base; stem striate, stoloniferous, rooting at lower nodes, thickened at nodes reddish or purplish. Leaves are opposite and bisexual flowers are in groups of 3-5 [3]. However, C. prostrata cannot be found universally and it grows only in area which has wet climatic condition. C. prostrata gets easily spoil with the atmospheric humidity unless it is stored in air tight bags. Therefore, C. prostrata is not available in the local market. Achyranthes aspera Linn (Sinhala name Gas-Karalheba) is also belonging to plant family Amaranthaceae. Sri Lankan Ayurvedic physicians use this plant as a substitute for C. prostrata. A. aspera is found on road sides, field boundaries and waste places as a weed throughout in Sri Lanka. It is a perennial herb, with a few spreading branches, cylindrical, hairy, internodes 8- 12.5 cm long, striate, nodes are bulged, often tinged with pink colour. Leaves are simple, and flowers are arranged in long spikes form in inflorescences with white small flowers [3]. Decoctions made out of whole plants of C. prostrata and A. aspera are used as a remedy for hemorrhoids. Ayurvedic pharmacodynamics properties are similar in both C. prostrata and A. aspera for instance both plants have potency of ushna (hot), pacify vata and kaphadosha. Therefore, an attempt was made to evaluate the suitability of using A. aspera as a substitute for C. prostrata in terms of (a) phytochemical screening and (b) in vitro antioxidant activities.Materials and methods Collection and identification of plant materials Whole plants of C. prostrata and A. aspera were collected from home gardens in Gampaha district, Sri Lanka between October to December 2014. The plant materials were identified and authenticated by Prof. M.H.A. Tissera, Head of Dravyaguna Department, Gampaha Wickramarachchi Ayurveda institute, University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka. Voucher specimens (CP-1 and AS -1) were deposited in Dravyaguna Department, Institute of Indigenous Medicine, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. Preparation of hot water extract Each plant material (60 g) was added to a vessel containing 1.92 L of distilled water and reduced the volume up to 240 ml under mild heat. After that, extract was filtered and filtrate was concentrated under vacuum and freeze dried (yields: 10.5 % w/w and 12.2 % w/w for C. prostrata and A. aspera respectively).Dissanayake DPA (2018) Linn and in 2-3 Res Rev Insights, 2018 doi: for saponins, phenols, flavonoids, glycoside and alkaloids were performed to hot water extracts of C. prostrata and A. aspera according to the methods described by Yadar and Agarwala [4]. Total flavonoid content (TFC) Different concentrations (125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.62, 7.81 and 3.90 \u00b5g/ml) of C. prostrata and A. aspera hot water extracts were prepared in methanol. One hundred microliters of 2% aluminium chloride in methanol solution was added to 100 \u00b5l of C. prostrata or A. aspera. The mixture was incubated at room temperature (25 \u00b1 2 oC) for 10 minutes and absorbance was recorded at 415 nm. Pre-plate reading was recorded before adding the aluminium chloride solution. Five different concentrations of quercetin were used to construct the standard curve. TFC of extracts expressed as mg quercetin equivalents per gram of extract [5]. Total polyphenolic content (TPC) Different concentrations (125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.62, 7.81 and 3.90 \u00b5g/ ml) of C. prostrata and A. aspera hot water extracts were prepared in methanol. Twenty microliters of C. prostrata or A. aspera hot water extract was added to 110 \u00b5l of ten times diluted freshly prepared Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and preplate reading was taken. Then seventy microliters of sodium carbonate solution was added to the mixture and incubated at room temperature (25 \u00b1 2 0C) for 30 minutes. The absorbance was recorded at 765 nm. Five different concentrations of gallic acid were used to construct the standard curve. TPC of extracts expressed as mg gallic acid equivalents per gram of extract [6]. 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay Reaction volumes of 200 \u00b5l of DPPH radical (125 \u00b5M) and 50 \u00b5l of different concentrations (125,62.5, 31.25, 15.62 and 7.81 \u00b5g/ml) of C. prostrata or A. aspera hot water extract mixed and incubated at 25 \u00b1 2 0C for 15 minutes and the absorbance was recorded at 517 nm. Five different concentrations of Trolox were used to construct the standard curve. Results were expressed as Trolox equivalents antioxidant capacity in mg Troloxequivalents per gram of extract on dry weight basis [7]. 2,2-azino-bis (3 ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonicacid) diam- monium salt stock solution of ABTS radical cation was produced by reacting 10 mM of ABTS in potassium persulfate at 37 oC for 16 h in dark. Reaction volume of 200 l, containing 40 M of ABTS+ radical and 50 l of 31.25, 15.62, 7.81, 3.90 and 1.95 g/ml of different concentrations of C. prostrata or A. aspera hot water extract was incubated at 25 \u00b1 2 oC for 10 min. and the absorbance was recorded at 734 nm. Five different concentrations of Trolox were used to construct the standard curve. Results were expressed as Trolox equivalents antioxidant capacity in mg Trolox equivalents per gram of extract on dry weight basis [8]. Oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) In brief, reaction volume of 200 l, containing 100 l of 4.8 M fluorescein and 50 l of 15.62 and 7.81 \u00b5g/ml of different concentrations of C. prostrata or A. aspera hot water extract was pre-incubated at 37 oC for 10 min. followed by addition of 50 l of potassium persulphate, 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH;40 mg/ml), to each well to initiate the reaction. The plate was placed on the fluorescent microplate reader set with excitation and emission at 494 nm and 535 nm and decay of fluorescein was recorded in 1 minute interval for 35 minutes. Trolox was used as a standard antioxidant. ORAC activities of the extracts were calculated by comparing the net area under curve of fluorescein decay between the blank and the extracts. Results were expressed as ORAC values in mg of Trolox equivalents gram of extract on dry weight basis [9]. Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) In brief, reaction volume of 200 l containing 150 l working FRAP reagent, 30 l acetate buffer and 20 l of 31.25 \u00b5g/ml C. prostrata or A. aspera hot water extract was incubated at room temperature (30 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C) for 8 minutes and the absorbance was recorded at 600 nm. Six different concentrations of Trolox were used to construct the standard curve. Results were expressed as Trolox equivalents antioxidant capacity in mg Trolox equivalents per gram of extract on dry weight basis [10]. Data analysis Data of each experiment were statistically analyzed using SAS software version 6.12. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Duncan's Multiple Range Test (DMRT) were used to determine the differences among treatment means. P<0.05 was regarded as significant. Results and discussion Antioxidant activities of C. prostrata and A. aspera hot water extracts were evaluated by using in vitro assays: TPC, TFC, ORAC. DPPH is a stable radical which gives a dark purple color at 517 nm. When DPPH radical react with a antioxidant, its purple color is disappeared and gives pale yellow color at 517 nm [11]. In ABTS assay, ABTS and potassium per-sulphate produce ABTS radical cation which gives blue green color at 734 nm. The green blue color of the ABTS radical will be converted to colorless when presence of antioxidants [12,13]. The capacity of a compound to scavenge peroxyl radicals was estimated in the ORAC assay. ORAC value is directly proportional to degree of antioxidant power [11]. FRAP assay can be used to measure the antioxidant power of compound/s [14]. According to the results, antioxidant activities of FRAP, DPPH and ABTS are almost similar in both C. prostrata and A. aspera. However, TPC, TFC and ORAC activities were higher in C. prostrata hot water extract than that of A. aspera. In vitro antioxidant activity of A. aspera grown in India was evaluated for different parts of the plant including stems, roots and leaves, roots, stems, leaves, inflorescence and leaves, stems, roots [15-18]. However, antioxidant activity was not evaluated for A. aspera grown in Sri Lanka. Similarly, antioxidant activity was evaluated for C. prostrata grown in Nigeria using the ethanol and methanol extracts prepared from the whole plant [19,20]. In the present study, FRAP and DPPH scavenging activities of C. prostrata and A. aspera were not significantly different from each other. Moreover, ABTS scavenging activities of C. prostrata and A. aspera were almost similar to each other (Table 1). However, ORAC, TFC and TPC of C. prostrata was significantly higher than that of A. aspera (Tables 1 and 2). Secondary metabolites such as saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids and alkaloids were present in both plant extracts and glycosides were not found in either C. prostrata or A. aspera. In the present study, mg Trolox equivalents per gram of extract were significantly higher in ABTS assay than that of DPPH assay. This may be that DPPH assay is capable of measuring only the hydrophilic antioxidants whereas ABTS assay measures both hydrophilic and Dissanayake DPA (2018) Comparison properties of Cyathula prostrata Linn and in Rev Insights, 2018 doi: 10.15761/RRI.1000138lipophilic antioxidants [8]. According to Ibrahim and co-workers [20], C. prostrata grown in Nigeria had no antioxidant activity in DPPH assay. However, in the present study, C. prostrata grown in Sri Lanka has been shown an antioxidant activity in DPPH assay. Furthermore, almost similar quantity of phenolic compounds were present in C. prostrata grown in Nigeria (16.95\u00b13.32 mg gallic acid equivalents/g extract) and Sri Lanka (Table 2). Conclusion Hot water extracts of C. prostrata and A. aspera have shown marked in vitro antioxidant activities. Antioxidant activities of FRAP, DPPH and ABTS are almost similar in both C. prostrata and A. aspera. However, TPC, TFC and ORAC activities were higher in C. prostrata hot water extract than that of A. aspera. Saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids and alkaloids were present in both C. prostrata and A. aspera. When considering the similarities of phytochemical constituents and antioxidant activities of two extracts, A. aspera can be used as a substitute for C. prostrata . References 1.
