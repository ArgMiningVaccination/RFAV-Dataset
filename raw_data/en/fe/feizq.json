Douglas Gerwin and DavidMitchell will assume the role held by Susan as co-directors of the Research Institute. It is largely through Susan Howard's insight, initia- tive, and diligent work that the Research Institutewas first founded, and, over the years, has become amain center within the North American Waldorfmovement for identifying and carrying out impor-tant research tasks of Waldorf education. Susan co-founded the Research Institute with me in 1996 inresponse to a call from Henry Barnes at theAssociation of Waldorf Schools of North America(AWSNA) Delegates meeting that year for someway to implement concerted and sustained researchin Waldorf education. Susan served as co-director ofthe Institute from 1996 to 2000. At that time,Roberto Trostli took over for two years as the firstpaid (part-time) director of the Research Instituteand editor of the Research Bulletin. In the year 2000, he was succeeded by Susan, who served asdirector from then to the present. In addition toher new role as co-coordinator of the InternationalWaldorf Kindergarten Association, Susan will con-tinue as chair and coordinator of the Waldorf EarlyChildhood Association of North America(WECAN). And she will continue to direct the part-time Early Childhood Teacher EducationProgram at Sunbridge College. It should be noted and underscored, however, that Susan will continue to be a member of the Board ofthe Research Institute, and, through her new workinternationally, will help to expand concretely theconnections of the Research Institute with Waldorfeducation world-wide. One of her responsibilities,for example, with the International KindergartenAssociation (and for WECAN as well) is to workwith research and publications in early childhoodeducation. That, she says, will continue to be amajor purpose of her activities on the ResearchInstitute Board with the aim of fostering and dis-seminating research being done on healthy earlychildhood development and education. As editor of the Research Bulletin and long a col- league of Susan Howard, I want to take this oppor- tunity to express my personal gratitude for all thatshe has done to make the Research Institute a reali-ty that can continue to develop and to serveWaldorf education into the future. I am also deeplygrateful for all her essential advice, good counsel,and input over the years for the Research Bulletin (and readers would not be amiss if they hear in thisa sigh of relief on my part that she will still be avail-able as a continuing member of the Board for herindispensable editorial consultation). New Co-directors for the Research Institute2 From The Editor The Research Institute is especially fortunate to have as its new co-directors (taken in alphabeticalorder) Douglas Gerwin and David Mitchell. Bothbring great wisdom and long years of experience invarious aspects of Waldorf education to the leader-ship of the Institute. Douglas Gerwin, Ph.D., is director of the Center for Anthroposophy in Wilton, New Hampshire.Himself a Waldorf graduate, Douglas has taught atthe university level, and, for the past 21 years, atthe high school level in subjects ranging from biol-ogy and history to German and music. In 1984 hereceived his doctorate in psychology and literaturefrom the University of Dallas, where he also taught.Before entering the teaching profession, he servedfrom 1972 to 1978 as foreign correspondent, edi-tor, and radio broadcaster for Reuters News Agencyin Europe. Douglas presently divides his time between adult education and teaching in various North AmericanWaldorf high schools. In 1994, he founded, andcurrently chairs, the Waldorf High School TeacherEducation Program under the auspices of theCenter for Anthroposophy. This program offersWaldorf teacher preparation in conjunction withAntioch University's New England GraduateSchool. In 1998, he helped to launch the WaldorfHigh School Research Project, an initiative spon-sored by AWSNA and the Research Institute forWaldorf Education. The Research Project ischarged with investigating changes in the nature ofadolescence today, as well as initiating researchrelated to the Waldorf high school curriculum andpedagogy. In addition to writing a number of arti-cles on adolescence and the Waldorf curriculum,Douglas Gerwin is editor of three books related toWaldorf education: For the Love of Literature: ACelebration of Language and Imagination (1996); Genesis of a Waldorf High School: A Source Book(1997 /2001); and The Andover Proceedings:Tapping the Wellsprings of Health in Adolescence(2002). Douglas Gerwin resides in Amherst,Massachusetts, with his wife Connie, a Waldorf highschool teacher of mathematics. Their two children,now young adults, both attended Waldorf schoolsin the United States and Germany. David Mitchell, new co-director of the Institutewith Douglas Gerwin, is chair of AWSNA Publications and is a member of the DevelopmentCommittee. His engagement and leadership inWaldorf education has been extensive and deep.For ten years (from 1992-2002), he was on thehigh school faculty of the Shining MountainWaldorf High School in Boulder, Colorado, whichhe helped found, teaching life sciences,Shakespeare, and blacksmithing. Before that he wasone of the founders of and a class teacher for twen-ty years (1972-1992) at the Pine Hill WaldorfSchool in Wilton, New Hampshire. During muchof the time in New Hampshire (1978-1992), healso helped initiate and teach in the WaldorfProgram at Antioch New England GraduateSchool. He has held and continues to be involvedin numerous leadership positions in AWSNA, andfrom 1990 to the present has been a member of theU.S. Department of Education Committee forPrivate School Leadership. David Mitchell hasreceived recognition in several national \"Who'sWho\" registries of outstanding professional educa-tors. Under his editorial leadership, the AWSNAPublications Committee has become a major sourceof Waldorf and Waldorf-related books and other lit-erature. David is an alumnus of the University ofMassachusetts and has done graduate work at theUniversity of Heidelberg in Germany, EmersonCollege in England, and the University of Oslo inNorway. He and his wife have four children andlive in Boulder, Colorado. Douglas Gerwin and David Mitchell bring rich per- sonal and professional resources to the directorshipof the Research Institute\u2014resources that will helpmaintain the continuity and enable the furtherdevelopment of the Research Institute work estab-lished by Susan Howard and Roberto Trostli. About This Issue Nearly all the articles in this issue deal with variousaspects of how the image we hold of the humanbeing has direct implications for education, withspecific reference to the healthy development of theyoung child. In this regard we are especially fortu-nate to welcome again two authors who have con-tributed to previous issues of the Research Bulletin, Steve Talbott and Dr. Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler.2 From The EditorDouglas Sloan 3 Steve Talbott's article, \"Science and the Child,\" looks specifically at the current attempts, increasing- ly widespread in our general culture, to produce \"better children\"\u2014to \"improve\" children throughgenetic engineering and through the use of drugsto control behavior. His article, however, puts thisissue in a much wider and richer context, examiningthe dominant, modern scientific conception ofnature and of the human being. This is the viewthat all of life is essentially quantitative and mecha-nistic. Talbott examines the conceptual limitationsof the mechanistic view and its fundamentallydestructive consequences. He calls for the develop-ment of a qualitative science\u2014a science of quali-ties\u2014that would enable us\u2014among many otherthings such as being able to deal adequately withmeaning, values, life, and qualities themselves, trulyto \"listen to the child\"\u2014to recognize the whole-ness, the integrity, and the wisdom of childhooditself. Beyond being a fascinating, critical examina-tion of current mechanistic attempts to \"improve\"children, this article is foundational in every sense,showing the crucial importance for all of life and,not least, for education, of our view of the humanbeing and our ways of knowing. The two articles by Dr. Gl\u00f6ckler build a new model for approaching the questions of health and disease,a model reported by her in earlier articles of theResearch Bulletin. This approach, given the name salutogenesis from the two Greek words meaning health and origins, stresses a primary concern withthe conditions that promote health, rather than adominant concern with pathogenesis, the treatment of disease, the latter being the primary approach todate of most modern medicine. Her first article,\"Can Meditation Take the Place of Exercise?\" looksat the relationship between meditation, movement,and health. Meditation cannot replace physicalmovement, and in young children, especially,should not. For young children, movement is essen-tial to the full development of their intellectual,emotional, and social capacities. For the teacher,movement is, of course, also important, but con-templative practice is indispensable. Dr. Gl\u00f6cklerexplores this relation in this article, which focuseson the stages of life and the different members ofthe human being. In her second article in this issue, \"Non-VerbalEducation: A Necessity in the Developmental Stages,\" Dr. Gl\u00f6ckler shows the crucial importanceof non-verbal learning during the early imitativestage of the child for the later healthy and fulldevelopment of the growing human being. Inexploring the nature of non-verbal education, shealso provides concrete indications of how one learnsto educate non-verbally. Related to the articles by Steve Talbott and Dr. Gl\u00f6ckler is the research report entitled, \"TheLowering of School Age and the Changes inChildhood.\" Although this report refers to effortsof Waldorf educators in Germany to respond cre-atively to the growing movement there to lower thebeginning school enrollment age, this report hasdirect relevance to the American situation wheresimilar pressures for ever-earlier academics, alongwith standardized testing, which is part of thismovement, continue to mount. This is a move-ment driven primarily by political/economic inter-ests, not the interests of the child. The report looksbroadly at the situation of Waldorf elementaryschools in Germany, the changes in children nowentering the schools, the challenge posed by thelowering of school age, and the developmentalproblems this age-lowering threatens. NorthAmerican Waldorf educators should find this reportextremely helpful in understanding our own situa-tion. Furthermore, the concrete projects describedin the report, projects being developed by GermanWaldorf educators for adequately dealing with thesenew pressures and changing situations, may provehelpfully suggestive to North American Waldorfeducators facing similar challenges. The article by David Adams, \"Organic Functionalism: An Important Principle of the VisualArts in Waldorf School Crafts and Architecture,\"will be of interest not only to teachers of appliedvisual arts, but also to all who are concerned withthe interconnections among the visual arts, the larg-er architectural environment, the healthy physicaland spiritual development of children ( salutogenesis again), and the social impact which these intercon-nections\u2014or lack thereof\u2014involve. The authorconcludes that the \"'organic functional' aspect ofSteiner's artistic hopes for Waldorf education havebeen much neglected in North America.\"4 From The Editor Some Brief Reflections on Waldorf Education as a Powerful Counterforce to the ModernAssault on the Human Being The article by Steve Talbott in this issue has prompted these reflections on the issue he raises ofthe importance of the image we have of the humanbeing and its role in education. Every educationaltheory and its practice imply and draw upon someimage of the human being. So we must ask ofevery educational endeavor, \"What image of thehuman being is at work in it, and what are the con-sequences?\" To drastically oversimplify, Waldorfeducation views the human being as a wholeness ofbody, soul, and spirit with the potential of becom-ing a free, responsible, caring, and creative individ-ual. Through its pedagogy and curriculum,Waldorf education strives to nurture that becomingto its fullest in each individual child. Unfortunately,as Steve Talbott's article makes vividly clear, mod-ern culture and education are increasingly dominat-ed by images of the human being that fix andreduce the human to something less than human,to some kind of mechanistic entity. In the preface to his recent book, The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence, Ray Kurzweil, a leading figure in the \"artificial intelligence\" community, writes: \"Theprimary political and philosophical issue of the nextcentury [this century] will be the definition of whowe are\u2014of how we define human.\" 1Kurzweil has, indeed, identified one of the central questions fac-ing us today. Kurzweil himself, however, is notsimply making a neutral statement. Rather, he iscontending for a specific image of the human beingas a machine. Granted, his is not the old machineof wheels, gears, and cogs, but, rather, the new,streamlined, cybernetic machine of electronic andchemical reactions as information carriers. Thisimage nonetheless depicts the human being asentirely the product of material forces, and, ineffect, reduces meaning, values, purpose, the wholerealm of qualities, and selves to mere reflections ofmaterial, mechanistic forces and processes. The late Francis Crick, noted biochemist become cognitive scientist, starkly expressed this view a fewyears ago in the opening paragraph of his book, The Astonishing Hypothesis: The Scientific Search for theSoul. Crick wrote: You, your joys and sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identityare in fact no more than the behaviour of a vastassembly of nerve cells and their associated mole-cules. . . . you're nothing but a pack of neurons. 2 Such an image of the human being is dominanttoday in many fields\u2014cognitive science, geneticresearch, and much of modern medicine, to name afew. This image also permeates a good deal of pop-ular culture, popular consciousness, and moderneducation. Consider, for example, this 1997 state-ment of the International Academy of Humanismin which Crick was joined by other leading figures,including biologists Richard Dawkins and E.O.Wilson and the \"humanists\" Isaiah Berlin, W.V.Quine, and Kurt Vonnegut. In justification for thescientists' demanding a free hand in human cloning,they write: Humanity's rich repertoire of thoughts, feelings, aspirations, and hopes seems to arise from elec-trochemical brain processes, not from an imma-terial soul that operates in ways no instrumentcan discover. . . . Views of human nature rootedin humanity's tribal past [tribal past meaning, asthey say earlier in their statement, humankind'sreligious and moral traditions] ought not to beour primary criterion for making moral judg-ments about cloning [and presumably aboutanything else]. 3 Several observations should make us highly suspi-cious of such statements from the outset. In thefirst place, if we agree that the whole \"rich reper-toire\" of culture is simply the reflection of electro-chemical brain processes and nothing else, we haveto include in those processes the thoughts andwords of those who write such statements. So whyshould we accept the results of their electrochemical brain processes rather than our own? Furthermore,these statements are patently self-serving. In spiteof the seemingly objective, scientific language, theclear intent is to justify unrestrained scientific andtechnological development without any considera-tions of the moral and environmental consequences.Power and profit are intimately intertwined withthis supposedly scientific view.Douglas Sloan 5 Beyond these initial common sense responses, there are other reasons for calling into question an exclu-sively mechanistic view of the human being. Thedoctrine of the mind as simply another word forbrain mechanisms means, to Crick and others, thatno non-sensory, immaterial realities exist: no souland spirit, for sure; but also no meaning, purpose,values, truth, beauty, or goodness. No ideas even.All these are, at most, a kind of illusory foamchurned up by the electrochemical discharges of thehuman machine. Such a view can, of course, never do justice to the reality of ideas, because ideas are non-sensory,immaterial. To be sure, most of our ideas probablyarise initially in connection with our sense experi-ences of the physical world, but they themselves arenever found among the objects of that world.Nonetheless, they can be powerful enough to pene-trate that world, enabling us to understand andtransform it radically. After all, it is by means ofideas that atoms are split. The fundamental powerof ideas was once vividly expressed by the greatmathematician Stanislaus Ulam, who was active inthe Manhattan Project. \"It is still an unendingsource of surprise for me,\" he wrote, \"to see how afew scribbles on a blackboard or on a sheet of papercould change the course of human affairs.\" 4And we ought not to forget that books that reduce ideasto mechanistic electrochemical discharges are them-selves presented in the form of ideas. Furthermore, a whole class of ideas exists called ideals: truth, beauty, goodness, love, joy, patience,kindness, fidelity, and so forth. These ideas\u2014non-sensory, immaterial through and through\u2014areextraordinarily powerful, for, to the extent that weare able to identify with them, they change us.Machines, obviously, are unaffected by ideal, moralconsiderations, and neither will human beings be soaffected to the extent that they allow themselves tobe defined, treated, and act as machines. Taken seriously, the view of the human being as a machine permits programming of the machine. Butit means also that all actions of the individual areunfree, completely determined by the automaticoperations of the machine, rather than by an at leastpartially free and responsible self. Since mechanicaloperations cannot take responsibility or be heldaccountable, any conceptions of human freedom, self-directed action, responsibility, and creativity arerendered meaningless. And, yet, all of us, includingthose who hold to the mechanistic view of thehuman being, have to assume in practice that ourbehavior is influenced by plans, purposes, andmotives, for which we are responsible. When peo-ple write books promulgating the view of thehuman being as mechanistically determined, theysurely believe that they themselves freely write thosebooks, even though for the purpose of persuadingreaders that there is no freedom, purpose, or self-determination. A theory that has to assume inpractice a freedom, purpose, and self-determinationdenied by the theory itself would appear to be ram-pantly self-contradictory. Of course, a view that denies the existence of a self that can be held accountable would lend itself tothe interests of those who are eager to engineer andcontrol nature and human beings, and, in short, toemploy any technology that works to their specialadvantage\u2014and to do all this at will, withoutrestraint, and for a profit. This is a view, moreover,that undergirds the growing global conglomerate ofscientists, governments, universities, and corpora-tions that seek to exploit and control nature andhuman beings for their own power, profit, and pres-tige. Unfortunately, this image of the human\u2014andof all life itself\u2014permeates much modern educationfrom top to bottom. Over a century ago in an essay on education, Ralph Waldo Emerson said that \"the surest bulwark of allthat is sacred in the human being is not to acceptdegrading views.\" Our culture and education todayare shot through with degrading views and theirdestructive consequences. Nevertheless, the humanbeing is\u2014for a time at least\u2014still human, a being ofbody, soul, and spirit; a being of interwoven intelli-gence, emotion, and intention, all capable of infi-nite development. This, our full human being, con-tains within itself the resources for countering andtransforming all those forces that would reduce thehuman to the non-human. But we must recognize,strengthen, and draw upon this fullness of thehuman being while it is still possible, while there isstill time. Ours is now a critical moment, for omi-nous signs exist that the time remaining for thefully human is seriously threatened and may be6 From The Editor drastically limited. This is why Waldorf education is far more important than we ourselves are perhapseven aware. REFERENCES 1.

Will Mommy die sometime, and, Daddy, will you die, too? Children are notorious for posing na\u00efve and per- plexing questions. When one of our sons was fouryears old, he asked, \"Why did God make poisonoussnakes?\" I do not recall our answer, but very muchdoubt whether it was helpful. And who among uscan do justice to the most perplexing question ofall\u2014the one incarnated in every newborn child:\"Who are you, and for what purpose have youentered our lives?\" The child's large and difficult questions arise, not from complex theoretical constructions, but fromsimplicity\u2014\"childish simplicity\" we are tempted tosay, with a slightly patronizing smile. We need, afterall, to defend serious discourse against fruitlessinquiries about God and the moral significance ofpoisonous snakes. This is why our more child-likequestions have, over the past few hundred years,disappeared from science. They are anachronisms,echoing hollowly off the instrument panels and sur-gically precise tools of the laboratory. Their implica-tions would be only an embarrassing distractionoddly disjoined from the prevailing paths of techni-cal investigation. \"Child, for what purpose have youcome?\" Imagine a genetic engineer or an evolution-ary theorist asking such a question!Yet a strange thing is happening. Questions rather like the child's impossible ones are now beingforced upon us from the side of science. Thebiotechnologist, faced not with poisonous snakesbut with \"defective\" children, is led to ask, \"Wheredo these defects come from? Can we unmakethem?\" And further, regarding the child's destiny:\"Why do we age and die? Must we submit passivelyto human limitation?\" I say \"rather like\" the child's questions. For the child is always inquiring about meaning and pur-pose. His question about why we age and die ismorally, teleologically, and aesthetically tinged. Thescientist, by contrast, is asking about the mecha-nisms that \"implement\" aging and death, and won-dering to what effect we might manipulate them. Such, at least, is the usual distinction, not only between child and scientist, but also between the scientific dialogue and the larger human conversa- Science and the Child Steve Talbott Author's note: This is a revised version of an article that appeared in the Winter 2004 issue of The New Atlantis. I had been invited to write a response to a report of the President's Council on Bioethics, \"Beyond Therapy:Biotechnology and the Pursuit of Happiness\"\u2014and specifical- ly to the chapter entitled \"Better Children.\" The chapter deals with attempts to improve children through genetic engineer- ing and through the use of drugs to control behavior. You will find the report at www.bioethics.gov.8 Science and the Child tion. But the distinction is muddied when scientists tell us (or conspire in our belief) that they are gain-ing the knowledge to engineer better children.How can you recognize a better child if you mustshun the language of value? More specifically, howcan we, as scientists or parents, propose to manipu-late an individual child's destiny if we cannot seri-ously ask about that destiny\u2014about identity andpurpose and tasks? If the scientist is to join in such a conversation, then nothing less than a second scientific revolution willhave occurred. Science will have been reopened tothe categories of meaning, value, and purpose. Thegenetic engineer and the evolutionary theorist willlearn to ask, \"Child, for what purpose have youcome\u2014and how can we make things better for you?\" Without such a revolution there will be no true societal conversation. Rather, we will hear twoutterly different and dissonant styles of speakingand they will spawn endless confusions betweenthem. Using one style we will converse with thechild, and therefore at least partly in the child'sterms. With the other we will converse about thechild, concerning ourselves with the manipulationof genetic, hormonal, neural, and other mechanismsas if we were engaged in little more than an engi-neering project. Ends and Means The President's Council on Bioethics, with its dis-cussion of \"Better Children,\" has stepped boldlyinto the no-man's land these two ways ofspeaking. Perhaps wisely, \"Beyond Therapy\" hasnot asked for a revolution in science. Instead it hastried only to delimit the engineering project and toestablish the propriety of discussing the ends andpurposes of human life. The Council begins with the most fundamental question of all: \"What, exactly, is a good or a bet-ter child?\" Is it a child who is more able and talented? If so,able in what and talented how? Is it a child withbetter character? If so, having which traits orvirtues? More obedient or more independent?More sensitive or more enduring? More daringor more measured? Better behaved or moreassertive? Is it a child with the right attitude anddisposition toward the world? If so, should he orshe tend more toward reverence or skepticism, high-mindedness or toleration, the love of jus-tice or the love of mercy? As these questionsmake clear, human goods and good humanscome in many forms, and the various goods andvirtues are often in tension with one another.Should we therefore aim at balanced and \"well-rounded\" children, or should we aim also orinstead at genuine excellence in some one or afew dimensions? 1 Against the backdrop of these unanswered (andperhaps unanswerable) questions, the Council con-siders various genetic and pharmacological tech-nologies that promise to give us \"better\" children.The genetic technologies aim at shaping, choosing,or improving a child's native endowments. Prenataldiagnosis permits us to weed out fetuses with unde-sirable genetic traits. Preimplantation geneticscreening allows us to select in vitro embryos withdesired genetic traits. Genetic engineering wouldallow us to produce certain genetic traits by deliber-ate design. For now, prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation screening present only restricted possibilities for\"improved\" children. These methods are limited bythe genetic resources of the parents, neither ofwhom may have the desired trait. Further, mosttraits require the interplay of many genes, so even ifthe parents had the right genes, it would be nearlyimpossible\u2014short of producing and screeningthousands of embryos\u2014to find one with the rightgenetic combination. And even if our scientificunderstanding enabled us reliably to identify trait-specific gene combinations, it remains the case thatour powers of control would still be limited. As theCouncil points out, \"since most traits of interest toparents seeking better children are heavily influ-enced by the environment, even successful geneticscreening and embryo selection might not, in manycases, produce the desired result.\" 2 As for genetic engineering\u2014that is, the direct inser-tion of desired genes into an embryo\u2014the difficul-ties are even more imposing. Not only is there thechallenge of working with genes that interact in stilllargely unknown ways, but there is also the problemof inserting these genes into the embryo withoutdamaging it or causing unintended side-effects. Thehistory of genetic engineering in nonhuman speciesSteve Talbott 9 has been one long crescendo of discovery about such unintended consequences. The root of the problem is that the side-effects are not really side-effects. They are a meaningful activi-ty of the organism. As my colleague, CraigHoldrege, has shown in Genetics and the Manipulation of Life, 3the organism deals with a genetic or biochemical intrusion much as it dealswith a disturbance of its external environment\u2014byresponding as an integral whole. This is true even inthe plant. For example, when researchers insertedcarotene-producing genes in tomato plants, theplants did produce more carotene. But the sub-stance appeared in plant parts that normally don'thave carotene (seed coats and cotyledons)\u2014and themore the carotene, the smaller the plant became.Similarly, when herbicide resistance was geneticallyengineered into a mustard species (Arabidopsis), thegenerally self-pollinating plants started cross-polli-nating at twenty times the normal rate. Such side-effects, whether obvious or subtle, turn out to bemore the rule than the exception. The reason for this is simply that the organism adapts to a disturbance with its entire being andaccording to its own distinctive manner of exis-tence. Manipulating the parts forces a question thatcan be answered only by the governing whole:\"Who are you? What sort of a unity are you tryingto express?\" Even when our aim is nothing morethan effective, machine-like control, we cannot pre-vent the organism from responding in a meaningfuland conversational manner. And if this is the casewith a plant, it is certainly also the case with a child. Given the difficulties and limitations involved in the various genetic technologies, the Council believesthat \"prophecies and predictions of a 'new (posi-tive) eugenics' seem greatly exaggerated.\" 4But this does not relieve it of concern about the changesnow afoot. Even prenatal screening for disease,already a common practice, may be \"shiftingparental and societal attitudes toward prospectivechildren: from simple acceptance to judgment andcontrol, from seeing a child as an unconditionallywelcome gift to seeing him as a conditionallyacceptable product.\" 5 Beyond Passive-Aggressive Objectivity In the second part of the chapter on \"BetterChildren,\" the Council explores new pharmacologi- cal ways of altering children's behavior. It endorsesthe therapeutic use of behavior-modifying drugs indifficult cases, while questioning the casual relianceon drugs as a general strategy for obtaining well-balanced children. It notes that \"most childrenwhose behavior is restless and unruly could (andeventually do) learn to behave better, throughinstruction and example, and by maturing overtime.\" Drugs short-circuit this learning process byacting directly on the body. They raise the questionas to whether we are looking for the mere outward,behavioral result, or, instead, for the inner shapingof character that can only be learned: If the development of character depends oneffort to choose and act appropriately, often inthe face of resisting desires and impulses, thenthe more direct pharmacological approachbypasses a crucial element. The beneficiaries ofdrug-induced good conduct may not really belearning self-control; they may be learning tothink it is not necessary. 6 The child, that is, may come to \"look upon himselfas governed largely by chemical impulses and notby moral decisions grounded in some sense of whatis right and appropriate.\" 7 So the control of behavior is one thing, and themoral education of the child is quite another. Givenwhere we are now, making this distinction is an important step. But we should not imagine (and Idoubt the Council imagines) that we have harmo-nized the two conversations. The dilemma remains: how do we bring the researcher's language of factand control into worthwhile dialogue with the par-ent's language of ethics and purpose? Wouldn't thisbe like bringing the sober, sophisticated world ofthe mature scientist into meaningful relationshipwith the na\u00efve, morally infused world of the child? The idea of any such convergence may seem out- rageous. And yet, when the scientist offers theparent a menu of options for obtaining \"betterchildren,\" it is he himself who puts the questionsof meaning, value, and purpose on the table.When the going gets tough, he cannot fairlyretreat into the \"silence of objectivity.\" He cannotreasonably say, \"I offer you better children, but donot ask me what 'better' means or who the childis.\" This passive-aggressive refusal to engage the10 Science and the Child issue is least acceptable when coming from the person who forced the issue in the first place\u2014even if the issue threatens revolution. Can We Get from \"Ought\" to \"Is\"? In the blithe spirit of the child\u2014whose destiny weare, after all, presuming to address\u2014I wish to say afew words about the revolution. Desperately briefwords, necessarily, but words suggestive, I hope, ofan ultimate potential for our two conversations tobecome one. Not that we should underestimate the challenge. Scientists have apparent reason for their reluctanceto \"come out of the closet\" with their values. It haslong been part of their discipline to refuse as bestthey can all explicit dealings with questions of value,and the practical benefits of this austere objectivityappear to have been spectacular. In this light, thelatter-day quandaries of biotechnology look suspi-ciously like a trap, baited with all those metaphysicaland discipline-sapping enticements from which sci-entists have till now taken such great pains to flee.How, then, can we possibly ask the scientist, as ascientist, to participate in discussions about themoral education of the child or the moral implica-tions of a genetic alteration? Don't we leave thosetopics for the ethicist? More and more we do (as the President's Council on Bioethics can surely testify), which helps to explainthe disjointed nature of the two conversations. Thedisjunction has long been canonized in the philo-sophical proverb, \"You cannot get from facts to val-ues.\" There is no way to get from statements aboutwhat is to statements about what ought to be. \"Is\"and \"ought\" seem to come from different, incom-mensurable worlds. It hardly needs adding that thescientist is passionately committed to the factual andobjective\u2014to the is-ness of things. Look at the world through more child-like eyes, however, and the situation is wondrously trans-formed. The question becomes, not how do we getfrom an \"is\" to an \"ought,\" but rather the reverse.Putting it broadly: how do we manage to narrowour understanding down to a mere statement offact when we start with such valuative and psyche-laden terms as \"good,\" \"evil,\" \"ugly,\" \"beautiful,\"\"meaningful,\" and \"purposeful\"? For we do start that way. Historically, the narrow-ing down is exactly what happened. By all accounts the ancients experienced themselves as living withinan ensouled world\u2014one thoroughly drenched inperceptions of goodness and value. Even the physis or \"elementary substance\" of the early Greek philosophers was, as Francis Cornford remarked,not only a material thing but at the same time a\"soul-substance.\" Further, \"the properties ofimmutability and impenetrability ascribed [by someGreek philosophers] to atoms are the last degener-ate forms of divine attributes.\" 8 What is true historically is true also of the individualbiography. The child, too, lives in an ensouledworld. His incessant questions of meaning and pur-pose (\"Why ...?\") testify to an inborn convictionthat the underlying reality of the world is psychicand voluntary, bearing an obligation to sustaingood and reasonable appearances. Only with matu-ration does the child slowly gain a world of fact, anis-world, to set beside his birthright-world of con-genial value. Moreover, the birthright is never relinquished. Look at the mature human being\u2014in the life offamily and community, of work and recreation, offriendship and enmity, of politics and the acade-my\u2014and you will be hard put to find a single act,word, or gesture that is not suffused with value andpurpose. This is true even of the scientist in his lab-oratory, who, if he could really drain all his actionsof their valuative content\u2014say, by treating his col-leagues like objects or, for that matter, treatingsophisticated instruments like junk\u2014would be dis-missed as a psychopath. No, we do not find a realm of value-free, psychical- ly disinfected fact within the human sphere\u2014exceptin one place: the intellectual constructions we havelately undertaken in the name of science and its phi-losophy. These constructions are aimed, as far aspossible, at representing an antiseptic worldcleansed of everything human. It has, of course,been doubted whether such a cleansing is possible.In any case\u2014and speaking from the na\u00efve, child-likevantage point\u2014we might naturally paraphraseCornford by asking whether the antiseptic world ofmere fact is the last \"degenerate\" form of the psy-che's intrinsically much fuller affirmations. Certainlythis is the way it looks historically. But there is afurther question whether, even as a final achieve-Steve Talbott 11 ment, the fact-world attains independence. Or does it remain parasitic upon the less denatured realityfrom which it arose? Don't forget that these intellectual constructions of science take place according to certain restrictiverules, and the historical acceptance of the restrictionswas a matter of choice. Moreover, the choicesamounted to a decision, conscious or otherwise, toexclude from consideration everything meaningfuland psyche-laden\u2014everything that did not serve theinsistent drive toward a pure is-world. And it remainshighly significant that these very same choices arelinked to the most problematic aspects of sciencetoday. Here are two examples of what I mean. Focusing Down to a Null Point The child who asks about the red leaves of autumnis asking about red, not the wavelengths and fre-quencies of a physics text. He lives within a vividworld of sense qualities. This is why the Dutch psy-chologist, Jan Hendrik van den Berg, conceives thefollowing exchange: \"Why are the leaves red, Dad?\" \"Because it is so beautiful, child. Don't you see how beautifulit is, all these autumn colors?\" There is no trueranswer. That is how the leaves are red. 9 Of course, this is not the final or complete answer.As the child gets older, the answer could beenriched, not diminished, by an understanding ofthe interworkings and so-called \"mechanisms\" of anatural world that remains qualitative through andthrough. But a fateful choice intervened to alter anysuch understanding. Beginning with Galileo there was a conscious disre- gard of qualities within science\u2014and this for thesimple reason that qualities, as every child knows,are inescapably freighted with psyche. We experi-ence qualities \"in here\"\u2014within consciousness. Butwhat is insufficiently realized is that we also experi-ence qualities \"out there,\" in the only externalworld we have. We cannot characterize a world\u2014any sort of world\u2014without qualities. Subtract allqualitative content from your thoughts aboutthings, and there will be no things left. Try toimagine a tree without color or visible form, with-out sound in a breeze, without the smell of sap andleaf, without felt solidity, and the tree will haveceased betraying any sign of its existence. If you areinclined to redeem the situation with talk of mole- cules or subatomic particles, try to characterizethose without appealing to qualities! It's fine to say, \"We get from the qualitative world to the realities of hard science by dealing only withwhat can be quantified.\" But the phrase \"what canbe quantified\" is puzzling, since it has no meaningif we cannot say anything significant about the\"what\" we are quantifying. Given a set of quanti-ties, we have to know what they are quantities of, ifwe are to know anything at all about the actuallyexistent world. And how do we characterize a\"what\" without qualities? You can, then, begin to see what a vanishing, ghostly world we bequeath to the child. But, ofcourse, scientists do in fact rely on their awarenessof qualities. Otherwise, the world would have com-pletely disappeared and they would have nothing toexplain. It's just that the discipline of their sciencedoes not explicitly recognize the sense world in itsown terms\u2014the qualitative terms that pose, notonly the child's questions, but also the only ques-tions a truly observation-based science can have.The reason for the omission is clear: if researchersactually reckoned with the qualities they begin withand rely on, they would no longer find themselvestheorizing within a pure is-world. This by their ownadmission, since the whole reason for rejectingqualities in the first place was that they are \"con-taminated\" by the psyche and its values. A second historical choice, less conscious in its ori- gins, was to proceed by a method of analysis,assigning ultimate explanatory significance to thefurthest products of the analysis. The problem hereis that one never stops to consider a thing in itsown terms. The fiery tree of autumn resolves intoroot, branch, and leaf, the leaf into cells, the cellsinto organelles, the organelles into biochemicals ...and so on without end, down to the most remotesubatomic entities. \"Without end\" because therecould be no satisfactory end. If understanding mustbe given in terms of analysis, and if the analysiswere ever to stop at some fundamental, unanalyz-able thing, then that thing (upon which all else iserected) must, according to our method, stand asan incomprehensible mystery, no more approach-able than divine fiat. Analysis is an essential direction of movement in all12 Science and the Child scientific cognition. But if it is not counterbalanced by an opposite movement, then we can never sayanything about what is there\u2014what is presenting itself significantly as this particular thing of this par- ticular sort. We can speak only of the elements itconsists of. But this hardly helps, for of these ele-ments in their own right we can again say nothing,but must refer instead to what they consist of. Wehave no place to stop and say, \"Behold this.\" Byitself alone, the method is a way of never having toface anything. No wonder, then, that neither theevolutionary theorist nor geneticist ever sees in theorganism a creature of which we might stop andask, \"Who are you?\" A one-sided method of analysis, in other words, brings us again to a kind of emptiness. And, again,we must say: science is not really empty. The scien-tist is always recognizing the insistent presence ofthings in the world\u2014significant wholes\u2014even if thenature of this recognition receives no formal or sys-tematic acknowledgment alongside the analyticcleaving of wholes into parts. After all, you are notlikely to set about analyzing a thing if you have notfirst glimpsed it, at least intuitively, as a significantentity in itself. But your preferred method of analy-sis does not encourage you to attend to this wholein its own terms. If it did, you might find yourselfcaught up in something more like a conversationthan in the mere manipulation of parts. A Little Child Shall Lead Them These historical choices\u2014to reject qualities and toproceed by a one-sided method of analysis\u2014confrontscientists with a problem that looms so threateninglynear and so incomprehensibly large that ignoring it isalmost the only option. If, however, we could get upthe courage to face the problem squarely, it mightsuggest to us that we can never shrink the child's richcognitive inheritance all the way down to an is-worldof mere fact. We can approach this end-point only inmodern physics, and we achieve the approach onlyby depriving our theoretical constructions of theircontent. The reassuring certainties we enjoy in theseconstructions are the formal certainties of mathemat-ics. But they alone cannot give us a world. Some ofthe greatest physicists, in their more child-like, soul-searching moments, have admitted as much. Einsteinonce remarked:As far as the propositions of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as theyare certain, they do not refer to reality. 10 Another physicist, Sir Arthur Eddington, may havehad the same problem in mind when he wrote, [Our knowledge of physics] is only an emptyshell\u2014a form of symbols. It is knowledge ofstructural form, and not knowledge of content.All through the physical world runs thatunknown content, which must surely be thestuff of our consciousness. 11 Likewise, a pre-eminent physicist of our own era,Richard Feynman, confessed that \"we have noknowledge of what energy is\"\u2014and this same cogni-tive darkness overshadows the other key terms of ourphysics, such as mass, force, motion, time, and space. All this forcibly brings the truth home to us: we can hardly claim to have an is-world of fact withoutvalue, of object without subject, given that bothfact and object have become blanks to us, with theircontent shoved under our methodological rug. Didwe not exclude their content from view preciselybecause it speaks a language akin to our own interi-or? So, yes, if we ignore the world's content, we docome nearer to an is-world, but it turns out to bean empty world precisely because we have ignoredits content. And this content is exactly what thechild sees and puts a name to with his wonderfullyinnocent and simple observations. You may think it strange to arrive at puzzles of physics in a discussion of biotechnology and itsapplication to children. How have we gotten so farafield? But in an analytic era with its inevitable frag-mentation and intense specialization, recovering asingle, unified language for approaching the childmeans realizing first of all that far afield is not reallyfar afield. The most fateful, scientifically developed\"drug\" we administer to the child is not some high-ly specialized biomolecule bathing his neurons, butrather the ambient, scientific world-view saturatinghis consciousness. And the whole effect of this view,centered as it is in the emptied fact-world ofphysics, is to rob nature of any congenial contentfor the child. One way or another, we conduct a wide-ranging and gravely significant conversation with everychild. If our language remains that of fact and con-Steve Talbott 13 trol, then the language itself will dehumanize the child fully as much as any of the biochemical andgenetic ministrations that are such natural conse-quences of the language. In Beyond Therapy the President's Council on Bioethics has shown how revealing a second, value- centered language can be. But the decisive questionremains whether we can bring the two ways ofspeaking together in a harmony of meaning. Canwe, for example, learn to approach the genome breakthroughs in genetics\u2014breakthroughsof understanding rather than of technique\u2014awaitour ability to look at the organism qualitatively, inits own meaningful terms? And if we do so will wenot find the whole speaking through every part, sothat the child's genome can, when approached inthe right spirit, be discovered as part of thechild's\u2014this child's\u2014revelation of himself? Finally,is not our receptivity to this revelatory aspect of thehuman organism a prerequisite for entering into aconversation with the child about his \"betterment\"? These questions, like those of the child, may seem hopelessly large and impossible, ill-fitted to the sci-ence we are comfortable with. But perhaps whatmakes them discomfiting is our long habit of turn-ing away from them, and our attempt (alwaysunsuccessful) to escape the meaningful and livinglanguage adequate for framing them. If we could transform our dealings with the child into a genuinely two-way conversation, it mightprove healing, not only for the child, but for usadults and our science as well. Then the mostimportant thing might not be our perhaps imperti-nent question, \"How can we make you better?\"Rather, it might be how the child's innocent sim-plicity can counterbalance our sophisticated butone-sided adult constructions. If the child doesbring a task to the world, part of it may be to helpus become a little more child-like in facing a value-soaked world\u2014fearless in addressing this world withimpossibly large questions, and fearless as well in lis-tening for impossibly large answers.REFERENCES 1.

Only a Differentiated Picture of the Human Being Gives Us the Key to the Different Levels of Health Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler, M.D. Editorial Note: When the Olympic games are held, the human body receives a lot of attention. There is a relationship between movement and health. And it behooves especially those who are on a spiritual path to \"guard their physical andmental health.\" (Rudolf Steiner) Meditation cannot replace physical movement;by the same token, contemplative practice is indispensable. Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler makesthis clear in the following article which focuses especially on the stages of life and thedifferent members of the human being.* Physical exercise is a central concern in our time. The word exercise has come to includeall manner of movement exercises today; the term either refers to outer techniques which areakin to gymnastics or to inner work grounded inmeditative practice. The latter implies forms ofexercise involving highly refined types of movementthat are hardly perceptible from the outside, move-ments that can lead over into directing forces andcurrents inside the body. The aim of this work is tobring about a change within one's own constitu-tion, and to promote harmony and health. Thehuman body is more and more recognized aschangeable, vulnerable, unique, and irreplaceable. This one special body\u2014with its possibilities for inner and outer movement\u2014is the place where thehuman being, as an individual, can become aware ofthe self in relation to the whole of existence. Onlyinasmuch as I move myself in a physical, psycholog-ical, or spiritual sense do I become conscious of thefact that I actually exist on these different levels.Without movement or inner activity I neither expe-rience myself nor the world. Seen in this way,opportunities for movement and opportunities fordevelopment are one and the same thing. There is physical and soul/spiritual movement suit- able to every stage of life and, also, commensuratehealth. Therefore it is a decisive factor for child-hood, with its imperative to incarnate and make a * This article is a translation of an article that appeared originally in Das Goetheanum, No. 33/34 (August 15, 2004): 1, 3.Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler 15 home in the physical world, that sufficient room and stimulus for bodily movement are given.Bodily dexterity, muscle strength, and stamina inwalking, jumping, and \"working\" must all be builtup; all these things need years and years of practiceand repetition. To achieve this, sport, dance, and\u2014in Waldorf schools\u2014eurythmy all have their differ-ent effects; all of these forms of movement work intheir own particular ways and they are not inter-changeable. Forms of Movement for Body, Soul, and Spirit When we are engaged in sports, our spirit and soul are completely focused on the aim to be achieved inthe physical world. In tennis, for example, the focusis on hitting the ball. This orientation makes thepractice of sport an incarnating activity; it awakensus to the here and now in time and space.However, within our constitution the activity ofsports also furthers materialism, because in sportsthe spiritual serves the body to the highest degreepossible. In dance, body and spirit serve motivesand needs of the soul. The kinds of expression andexperience furthered for the soul depend on thekind of dance-technique. In eurythmy, on theother hand, body and soul are adapted to the formsof movement which are particular to the lifeprocesses of the body. This includes the means ofexpression of a conscious life in soul and spirit. The degree to which a human being can move and express himself freely in the course of his lifedepends on the solidity and versatility he has beenable to achieve in his inner and outer freedom ofmovement. And just as meditation cannot replacephysical movement in childhood and youth, sportsand physical movement cannot replace what has tobe achieved in later life. In youth it is necessary todo physical exercise in order to incarnate properly;later on in life, excarnating activity is needed. Inorder to come to oneself and wake up to one's spir-itual home, one needs to practice contemplationand meditation in accordance with one's intrinsicspiritual motives. Physical exercise and meditationboth have their time in life and need to be deter-mined in accordance with the particular demandsand needs of the individual.Development through the Tasks We Take upon Ourselves It is hard to find general rules in this realm, because of the difference in destinies and needs presentedby each individual life. Also, the debate of the last10 or 20 years between the different models of pre-venting illnesses, pathogenesis and salutogenesis,has shown us that health depends to a large degreeon an individual's will to live and overall motiva-tion. Even though it makes sense to recognize pos-sible harmful influences for body and soul and toavoid them, and, simultaneously, live as healthy alife as possible (pathogenetic orientation), there isalso validity in the fact that people will not be ableto develop enough strength and resistance withoutchallenges, without being taxed, and without facingthreats and danger; these will make us able to dealwith stress and cope with life and all its vicissitudes(salutogenetic orientation). We each need to learnto define our own individual boundaries in what weare able to take up and achieve. The discussions around this theme, between patho- genesis and salutogenesis, do show how helpful it isto have a differentiated picture of the human beingand to be aware of individual destiny. When thesefactors are taken into account, one gains the clarityone needs in order to proceed in one's own life.After all, the physical body has its own laws andneeds a specific stimulus for all its organs. The eyeneeds to deal with light and color in order to learnto see properly; the organs of digestion need differ-ent types of food. For the brain to develop proper-ly, it is necessary, among many other things, that amultiplicity of movement exercises are offered inthe context of coordination and dexterity. The laws of the etheric organism are the opposite of those of the physical. Here we meet a system ofregulatory processes that serves the preservation oflife functions, regeneration, and also healing. Whatis important here is not so much a focus on specificorgans; the point here is to stimulate the totalorganism. In order to stimulate the etheric, thesystem as a whole needs to be addressed. This canbe achieved by means of a healthy way of living aswell as by taking into account how the soul is treat-ed. After all, joy, contentment, beauty, religiousand artistic exercises as well as impressions of nature16 Can Meditation Take the Place of Exercise? are not merely sensations in their own right. They also have a positive effect on our feeling of well-being and, with that, the functions of the ethericorganism. On a soul level, however, the laws of polarity reign. In this realm it is necessary always to keep an eyeon the opposite sides and find a new balance inevery situation. Here we are dealing with the ten-sion between sympathies and antipathies, concentra-tion and relaxation, hyperactivity and exhaustion,feelings of abundance and emptiness. These oppo-sites which exist in our consciousness and are car-ried by the astral body, must be recognized, meta-morphosed, and utilized to support regenerativeand developmental processes. On the level of the I (the I organization), however, different laws hold sway. Here we are concernedwith integration and building identity, as well as theability to communicate on a spiritual level. Thatwhich counts here are the things a human beingcommits to, the areas where an individual choosesto engage in life and is able to take responsibility.These factors become an integrated part of eachindividuality. Viewed in this way there are two wellsprings of health: the etheric organism and the activity of theI. Those are matched with the two levels on whichthe human constitution functions: the physicalorganism and the astral organization. These lattertwo are also where outer and inner causes of illnessoriginate. The more we pay attention to our physi-cal health (proceeding from the ether body) and toour spiritual health (proceeding from the I organi-zation), the more we will be able to gain spiritualand bodily mobility on our way through life.Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler was born in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1946. She studied medicine at the universities of T\u00fcbingen and Marburg and went on to study pediatricsat the community hospital of Herdecke and at theUniversity children's clinic of Bochum. She practiced as apediatrician and school doctor for ten years. Since Easter1988, she has been the leader of the Medical Section atthe Goetheanum. She lectures and writes books on med-ical, physical, and religious topics, and also on counseling.She writes: \"In my practice as a pediatrician I met manychildren with movement challenges who were strugglingwith speech problems and learning disabilities. As aresult I have come to value the benefits of movementmore and more, particularly in infancy and in childhoodin general. My work as a physician has also made merealize that bodily fitness and good nutrition are not theonly prerequisites for a healthy life. Active work in therealm of the spirit and the soul are needed just as much.\" Non-Verbal Education: A Necessity in the Developmental Stages Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler, M.D. Typically, human beings never finish learning, and even when getting older they will keepadding new things to what has already been attained. At the same time, it is obvious that thedegree and manner of learning changes during thecourse of life. Every stage of life is specially adaptedto certain learning processes. This shows most sig-nificantly in the first twenty years when, along withbodily growth, the soul-spirit's ability to take thingsin and readiness to learn are buoyant. With thissketch as background, we may focus our attentionon the preschool years. The Development of Learning Ability up to the Beginning of Adulthood During the course of their development children learn in different ways. In the first years it happensthrough imitation: e.g., walking, talking, thinking,the handling of objects, getting dressed andundressed, eating habits, shaking hands when meet-ing people, and much more. What lies behind this?Learning through imitation means teaching yourself according to a perceived role model. Without anyexplanations or pedagogical instruction being given,children absorb all the events happening aroundthem, practicing out of their own inner drive untilthey have attained the corresponding skills.Children do not learn to speak through explana-tion, nor do they learn to walk through instructionson how to move. They learn these complicated andfar-reaching human capacities solely through theirown inner drive, modeled on the pattern providedby adults. This concentrated, imitative learning ofthe child\u2014an activity which is kindled by the rolemodel and tirelessly practiced\u2014is here termed non-verbal learning, i.e., learning without words.Parents who endeavor to set an example for theirchildren in this manner could, therefore, be callednon-verbal educators. An example might make clear what this means. In a doctor's practice it often happens that when amother and child come into the office a problemarises. The doctor has greeted the mother and thenIt is not moral preaching and not reasoned instruction that work on chil- dren in the right way: that which works is what the adults in their surround- ings do visibly before their eyes. \u2014 Rudolf Steiner 18 Non-Verbal Education: A Necessity in the Developmental Stages turns to the child who also holds out her hand. Often with little children it is not the right handbut the left. The mother who knows about non-verbal education will look on calmly while the childgives the doctor her left hand. The doctor takes itin a friendly way; however, the mother who is notaccustomed to this method of child-upbringing willimmediately instruct the child to give the doctorthe \"proper\" hand. Ashamed or disappointed, thechild often will just withdraw her hand. The sponta-neous readiness to greet has vanished; sometimesthe hand sinks down listlessly or slips behind theback, and an awkward silence arises. How differentit is for the child who shakes hands out of pure imi-tation, where it is left to the doctor to determinewhether, after having taken the left hand and said,\"Hello,\" he also does the same thing with the righthand, or simply leaves it at one handshake, knowingfull well that things will correct themselves betweenthe ages of five and seven. If an adult corrects children verbally in the pre- school years, their age-appropriate mode of learningis not supported, thus bringing an element intotheir education that is only applicable to a laterstage of life. Since a preschool child is able tounderstand the meaning of an action intuitively andthen imitate it, he or she is not ready to deal withexplanations about the deed. The readiness foraction\u2014both the will and the physical motoric (i.e.,its movement) is still bound to the sense experi-ence. The eminent French developmental psycholo-gist Jean Piaget identified this phase as sensory-motor intelligence (sensory stands for sense experi-ence; motor stands for organs of movement, i.e.,the muscular system). Intelligence and meaning arenot yet abstracted independently from the bodilyexperience, but work directly, intuitively throughthe senses so that the movement, dependent uponthe senses, happens as one, unified, imitativeprocess. In the most intelligent way, children can dowhat they see and repeat what they hear.Everything that they experience is understoodimmediately, even if they have no words or conceptsfor it. The whole sense world is experienced directlyand \"sensibly\"\u2014it instantly \"makes sense!\" Thisonly changes when thinking becomes emancipatedfrom the body, at which point direct sense experi-ence is lost. When this emancipation occurs, senseexperience is accompanied more and more by thought. It is more conscious. This later mode oflearning, grounded in thinking, is much harder toattain and grows much more slowly than the intu-itive preschool mode. It is therefore important not to shorten the imita- tive phase by developing abstract intelligence pre-maturely. However, this is exactly what happenswhen the little child is educated verbally, throughexplanations being offered. Moreover, this prema-ture awakening of abstract intelligence often occurs,for example, when a child of four, who has already\"enjoyed\" this mode of verbal education, is admit-ted to school. Such children are often seen standingapart or lolling around with their hands in theirpockets watching what the others are doing. Theyhave no inclination to enter into the games that aregoing on so uninhibitedly and imitatively. It usuallytakes six months or longer until they are ready tojoin in and, through seeing what the others aredoing, become just as involved. Why is it so important that preschool children have the opportunity to imitate as much as possible? Thisis because every activity, and especially every physi-cal skill which arises through imitation, not onlyprepares abilities for later life but also gives impetusto the healthy development of physical functioningduring those years. We must not forget that chil-dren are not only learning; day-by-day they aregrowing up. Learning and growing are inextricablybound together. So the question is: does everylearning process also support the child's physicaldevelopment? It is obvious that physical develop-ment in children is best stimulated by copying andparticipating in activities that require skillful dexteri-ty rather than by sitting still\u2014as for instance infront of the television or with electronically con-trolled toys and games where a minimum of skillfulmovement is required. It is also good, where possi-ble, to avoid being hemmed in within small apart-ments without any interesting things going on tostimulate imitation. Rather, give children the possi-bility of bringing all their physical capacities intoplay (particularly their movement capability, theirsense of balance, and their fine and gross motorskills). Every act of learning is at the same time an act ofMichaela Gl\u00f6ckler 19 will. Learning requires effort. With preschool chil- dren, the will is still integrally bound to the sensoryactivity, without any intervening cognition.Uniquely, this gives the possibility for optimal learn-ing in accordance with the functions of the senseorgans and the interest with which the child useshis sense organs to take in the world. Some childrenhave more interest, some less. There are those withthe possibility of wide-awake attention and thosewhose powers of attention are weak. The adultsmust know how they can awaken the children'sinterests and gain their attention. This happenswhen whatever needs to be done is undertaken joy-fully and with enthusiasm. Something done withcare and in a loving, enthusiastic manner evokes thechild's interest much more than when one doesthings in a listless, uninterested or even grudgingway. Something similar can be seen also with olderchildren. For example, when it is a question of whoshould clear up after the meal, if someone jumps upand says, \"I'll wash up today. Anyone coming tohelp?\" and then disappears into the kitchen to makea start, others will now follow suit, rather thanwhen everyone gets up quietly after the meal andtries to make himself invisible with the hope thatsomeone else will do it. The more convinced anadult is about what he does, the more attractive it isfor the imitative situation of the child. All this changes when school begins and the child's readiness to act becomes more independent of senseimpressions. As motivation, he now needs his feel-ings to be stirred, for between the change of teethand puberty the feeling life develops. The childrennow do not react primarily to what they see andexperience, but to what they feel. They judge every-thing they experience according to feeling.Sympathy and antipathy play a big part in this.Which teacher they like, which clothes please them,which pupils in the class are \"slow\" (as some chil-dren put it)\u2014all this is affirmed and discussed.What pleases them, and what does not, play a bigrole in all they do. The teacher must succeed inarousing feelings that give wings to their willingnessto learn. However, since learning is always boundup with effort, it cannot only be a matter of thepupils learning what they enjoy learning. It is muchmore important that the pupils learn to love makingan effort of will in the whole process of learning.They can achieve this when they come to like the adult concerned. Indeed, just at this age we meetthe phenomenon of those pupils making goodprogress in the subjects where they like the teacher.For example, a child who has never understoodanything in mathematics suddenly becomes quite asuccessful pupil after a change of teachers, if thenew one has an empathetic connection with thechild. At this age, naturally, verbal education is necessary. It is also appropriate because the intelligence of thechild has become emancipated to the extent thatshe can retain in her memory what the teacher hassaid. She grasps the meaning that is contained inword and sentence independently of outer action.This ability appears towards the end of the kinder-garten, when it is time for elementary school tobegin. You can recognize this in how children listento a story. As long as they remain in the non-verbalmode of learning, their memory is not yet inde-pendent. They love to hear the same stories againand again and to play the same games over andover. Grownups are often amazed that the childrendo not get bored. They do not because their mem-ory has not yet reached this level of independence;the intelligence lives completely in activity. The chil-dren have, so to speak, a repetitive memory. In therepetition of an event or story they feel that theyknow it already. The pleasure of remembering onlystirs while re-enacting the event or re-hearing thestory, and not in the independent way that is laterthe case. This new mode of learning hops to the forefront between the sixth and eighth years. You first noticeit when, suddenly, the child does not want herbeloved bedtime story, but instead wants to hearsomething new. She no longer lights up happilywhen mother says that it's time for Snow White, but objects: \"I know that one so well already, I want adifferent one.\" Then this moment has come. Aslong as the children are glad to hear the same storyrepeated again and again they are still in the non-verbal phase in which intelligence is not accessibleto them in abstracto. After puberty, eagerness to act requires yet anothermotivation. Neither example nor feeling alone pro-vides sufficient motivation. Young people must see20 Non-Verbal Education: A Necessity in the Developmental Stages for themselves what they have to do. It becomes more and more evident that adolescents will onlydo what they understand, while acknowledging thereasons. Will and readiness for action have nowbecome dependent on thinking and on insight.Young people do not want to carry out an actionprimarily to please an adult, but because they seesome justification for it. If these different modes oflearning in childhood and youth are taken intoaccount, the task of education is made easier. If not,problems and conflicts arise which have to be over-come every single day and are deleterious for theclimate of learning. How Does One Learn to Educate Non-Verbally? We are often faced with the predicament: How do we react in the preschool years when the childrefuses to do what we ask? How do we get thechild to do what we want without a huge torrent ofexplanation and justification? Here one can learn agreat deal in one of the kindergartens where non-verbal education is practiced. In the Waldorf kinder-garten, for example, it works as follows. When thechildren are playing outside, walking on stilts orbuilding little dens, and it is time to come indoorsto eat, many of them get upset at the thought oftheir fun being curtailed. It is a great help, in suchcircumstances, if the meal is always at the same timeand the children are accustomed to it. Habit is animportant support for non-verbal education. Itbecomes self-evident that you follow the routine. The kindergarten teacher goes from group to group, singing the song that she sings every morn-ing, signifying that they leave their treasured gameand come in to eat. A few children are already fol-lowing her. This extends into a little parade whichaffects and draws the others. More and more join inuntil the whole group goes inside. No scolding, noadmonition, no telling off\u2014simply going insideembraced by everyone. A mother once said to me, \"When I hear you speaking like this I find it all perfectly understand-able; but then when I'm at home I always askmyself, why has my clarity disappeared? It does notwork as I hoped it would.\" This is the kind ofproblem that confronts people who are embarkingon non-verbal education. So why is it so difficult? Why is it hardly possible today for an adult torefrain from a whole rigmarole of explanationswhen he wants something from a child? He has tolearn that instead of words he needs to act with concentration. One has to do something that usual- ly does not happen today; namely, unite oneselfwith what one wishes in such a way that one canperform it almost as a ritual, through one's wholedisposition, and then bring it to full expression.When I speak about something and simultaneouslythink about it, I am immediately distanced from it.I think \"about\" it. I talk \"about\" it. I am not it. Iam not in it\u2014I am not completely at one with it. Itcannot speak out of me, or allow itself to manifestthrough me. This disconnected \"talking about a thing\" is ram- pant today. With one person you talk about some-thing in one way and with another person you talkabout it in another way. Opinions have somethingrelative about them; you do not want to tie yourselfdown. This is typical of the intellectual culture inwhich we live. One distances oneself; one does nottake things seriously but remains \"objective.\"Seldom is it necessary to really throw oneself heartand soul into something. Many pupils are not usedto taking seriously something that has been said byan adult. They think everything can be discussedand made negotiable\u2014that ultimately it is not deci-sive. And then they are extremely surprised whenthey meet a grownup whose every word carriesweight. Today we have all been brought up in this rather hazy, noncommittal way of life. This means that adegree of uncertainty will have brushed off on us.Most people have inferiority complexes\u2014they knowthey do not really understand a lot of what is goingon in the world. This kind of uncertainty in judg-ment, resulting in being unable to form an opinion,is widespread. Also relatively widespread is the feel-ing that what one thinks has only limited value;everything could actually be quite different.Openness and critical distance are naturally indis-pensable preconditions for a genuine and realisticstriving after knowledge. But they are underminingfor the phase of non-verbal education. At that agechildren simply want to experience the meaning ineverything that confronts them. If the adult cannotMichaela Gl\u00f6ckler 21 give this meaning because he or she is not con- vinced, or is uncertain, or experiences things as rela-tive and only of limited importance, the child doesnot receive what she or he needs. The child losesconfidence, and, through this, many typical educa-tional problems belonging to this age group ensue. The Rediscovery of Body Language Nowadays there is a whole spectrum of psychother-apies\u2014different schools ranging from sensitivitytraining to Gestalt therapy\u2014which aim to convey topeople what they think and feel inwardly, and howto relearn to express this in an honest way, throughthe body as well, and to show this in body lan-guage. It has been shown that many people becomeill through unbearable tension arising between whatthey experience inwardly and the facade that theyshow to the world. It is not that I am recommend-ing the above-named psychotherapeutic methodsfor learning how to educate non-verbally. I merelywant to emphasize that the possibility of non-verbaleducation\u2014that is, the ability to show throughbody language without words what one is thinkingand what is meaningful\u2014is something that is veryforeign to many adults in our time, and symptomsof illnesses often appear as a consequence. For learning how to educate in a non-verbal way I have two recommendations. First, eurythmy, wherein every movement something meaningful andentirely in correspondence with feeling and thinkingis brought to expression\u2014providing one practicesdiligently. Second, acting or drama, where onelearns to move expressively and only to say whatone really has to at a particular moment. It wouldbe ideal if parents of pre-school children would gettogether in groups, and act small scenes in mime inorder to express thoughts and feelings, patterns ofbehavior, commands and taboos, as well as everydayproblems in a non-verbal way. They should thenexchange impressions about what they have experi-enced. It is fascinating to see how engaged childrenbecome when an adult makes an interesting move-ment or when his face has a meaningful expressionthat is inclined towards mimicry. They love this sortof thing. The children will do everything the adultis asking of them simply because they do not wantto let him escape. They love to provoke simpleexpressive reactions in adults and like it when theirparents show their emotions. In this connection, it often happens that children in the kindergarten pick up all sorts of rude words andtrot these out provocatively in one or another situa-tion. A typical case might be as follows. A mothermeets an acquaintance on the street and begins aconversation. Little Johnny stands there and beginsusing rude or vulgar words. With interest heobserves how the friend becomes uncomfortableand the mother becomes embarrassed. MeanwhileJohnny is relishing the scene. But if the grownupscontinue talking unperturbed and ignore him as asign that his choice of words is not affecting them,the child will soon realize that the effort is notworth it. How does it happen that children instinctively know either that they have succeeded with suchprovocation or that it is not worth their while? HadJohnny just been walking with his mother alone, inall probability he would not have come out withanything of the sort. Such words only came into hismind when his mother started talking to her friend.Once again, in the non-verbal phase, childreninstantly absorb the meaning of all sensory experi-ences. They do not experience the sense experienceas separate from rational understanding. So it ispossible for them intuitively to grasp the moralqualities in the soul life of the adult. That whichoccurs for us adults in later life only in special situa-tions when, for example, we sense that there is an\"atmosphere\" in a room we are entering, or whenwe notice that two people are in love with eachother, is a daily and ongoing occurrence for chil-dren. As soon as the mother meets her friend, thechild feels that her interest has been deflected fromhim towards the other person. Through hisprovocative behavior he would like to bring itabout that he is once again the center of her atten-tion. However, he must learn that this cannotalways be, and the mother achieves this when she isquite consistent in doing what she considers isright\u2014in this case, continuing to talk to her friend.If she empathizes with the child, and understandsthat he feels a little forlorn, it will be easy for her,even while she's talking, to keep casting a glance athim, or make some little movement so that he doesnot feel left high and dry. In this way she may keepthe child from becoming provocative. 22 Non-Verbal Education: A Necessity in the Developmental Stages Conditions for Free and Responsible Action There is yet a third hindrance vis-a-vis non-verbal education\u2014the wish of many parents to allow theirchild to be free, not to follow directions. Hence, inorder that he not be alienated, the three-year-old isasked what he would like to eat or what clothes hewould like to wear. Whoever realizes that childrenof this age learn through example and are prone toabsorbing any uncertainty in the adult's attitude(for example that he is indecisive about what hewants and therefore asks the child) will change hisstance for the sake of the child. Freedom can onlydevelop when one has achieved one's own matureinsight. Of course, there are preliminary stages inthe development of freedom. In the non-verbalphase of education this consists in allowing thechild to imitate what he sees unrestrictedly andwithout reserve. He must be allowed to movefreely. The house should be so organized that onedoes not have to prohibit the children from this orthat; rather their impulse towards activity should beallowed free rein. The example comes from thegrownups, but the way in which the child respondsis freely experienced and freely formed. Similarly,later at school, when the children learn somethingbecause they like their teacher, the element of free-dom plays an important role. Because the child likesdoing something, she feels free, even if the impulsefor the activity has originated from an adult and notfrom herself. If children have been allowed todevelop through these preliminary stages, they willalso be in the position after puberty, when inde-pendent thinking and powers of judgment ripen, toact out of free, self-determined insight and personalunderstanding. Only then is true freedom possible. To summarize: in the preschool era, the key is trust in adults and free play of movement; in the schoolyears, love and joy of doing; and in young adult-hood, recognition for what is true and right\u2014theseare the preconditions for free and responsibleaction. Adults who bring trust towards the child so that she will make use of her freedom at maturity willfeel themselves, in the time up to then, like a proxy,merely replacing those capabilities over which thechild has no sovereignty during the course of hereducation. They will hold back whenever the childhas reached a sufficient degree of independence.Correspondingly, the child initially brings to theadult, and especially in the preschool years, deeptrust that the teacher will do what is right. Aninfant lying with open arms and open eyes, his dia-per changed, is at the same time an archetypalimage of trust-filled bliss. She allows everything tohappen to her. Something of this original trust per-sists through the whole preschool period, express-ing itself also in her need to give herself over toimitation. The child regards everything that hap-pens around her as worthy of imitation and trust.That is why it is so important that this trust is notbetrayed. It is betrayed, however, when the childexperiences that an adult does not know his ownmind. Likewise, when the course of the day lacksregularity and rhythm and security. But, if goodhabits are installed in the form of a definite sleep-ing-waking rhythm, in regular meal times, and inregular alternation of play and rest, the child feelsherself safe and protected, experiencing the courseof such a day as something into which she maygladly enter. As can be gathered from the above, it is straightfor- ward to understand the principle of non-verbal edu-cation; the challenge is to put it into daily practice.

Organic Functionalism: An Important Principle of the Visual Arts in Waldorf School Crafts and Architecture David Adams Waldorf education was intended not only to be an effective, holistic, child-centeredapproach to the education of children but also to be a force for larger cultural change. Do we who work in Waldorf schools ever think of ourselves as cultural revolutionaries? One of RudolfSteiner's often-overlooked ideals for Waldorf educa-tion in this connection was the development of acertain harmony between the approach to teachingapplied visual arts\u2014handwork and crafts\u2014and theapproach by which the forms and spaces of the sur-rounding classrooms were designed and built. Thesame ideals were to guide both kinds of form-creat-ing activity. Steiner envisioned the development of a new coop- eration between crafts/handwork, manual training,and artistic feeling. 1His indications for the teach- ing of crafts in the Waldorf schools aimed to lay thefoundation for this direction in the students' devel-oping will and feeling, so that the combining ofutility and beauty could gradually become a practi-cal habit, both within school graduates and,through their influence, in society in general. 2 Following an identical principle of design, schoolarchitecture and crafts instruction would togetherserve a new vision of the spiritual renewal of thedesign elements in our everyday environment. A few quotations from Rudolf Steiner will indicatehow he felt this to be a compelling social need of modern times: \"[D]o we not see how art has lostits connection with life? . . . We see how inartisticour everyday surroundings have become. Art hasmade an illusory progress. All the buildings aroundus with which we come in contact in our daily rou-tine are as devoid of artistic beauty as possible.Practical life cannot be raised to artistic formbecause art has separated from life.\" 3\"All the atrocities which surround us in any city of Europewe may happen to be in, would vanish if only wewould cultivate for a few generations the sense ofbeauty which lives unspoiled in every child.\" 4\"We need today to bring about the marriage betweenlife and art which, however, can flourish only in thesoil of a free life of spirit. . . . Imagine every school-room, not decorated in the way often thought artis-tic today, but shaped by an artist in such a way thateach single form is in harmony with what his eyeshould fall upon when the child is learning histables. Thoughts that are to be socially effectivecannot work socially unless, while they are beingformed, there flows into the soul as a side-stream ofthe spiritual life what comes from a really livingenvironment. For this, however, art needs to take aquite different course during children's growingyears from what is now accorded it.\" 5 What are the principles of the approach Steinerwanted to inaugurate in the Waldorf schools? He24 Organic Functionalism indicated the essential concept in a comment on handwork teaching: \"The starting-point in hand-work and the crafts should always be the purpose tobe served by the object in question. This is whatdetermines its color and form. . . . In every case wemust take into account the purpose which theobject has to fulfill in life\u2014that is the meaning ofhandicrafts.\" 6Likewise in architecture, Steiner indi- cated that the first step is to ask oneself \"What hap- pens?\" i.e., what activities are to go on within abuilding? 7Around these activities, these functions, the forms and spaces of the building should bedesigned. He used the analogies of the close-fittingrelationship between a walnut kernel and its nut-shell, as well as between a cake mold and a cake, todepict the kind of harmonious connection heintended between form and function (thinking of\"function\" in a broad, multi-dimensional way).The classrooms and school buildings were intendedto support the educational functions and theprocesses of human development that take placewithin the school. Form follows function. Style follows use. This is the fundamental concept. Its practice means thatevery work of design will have a functionally appro-priate, individual form or structural gesture. Thisapplies equally to large buildings and to the smaller,more intimate objects of our everyday life. In the case of smaller, utilitarian objects, the indi- vidualized form-gesture should express the charac-ter of the object's invisible function or purpose,especially its relationship to its human user. Louisevan Blommestein, the original crafts teacher at theFortbildungsschule (\"Continuation School\") inDornach, recalled Steiner emphasizing that in allthe artistic objects created for daily life \"it was thepurposeful relationship to the human being, forwhom they were being made, that was important,and this relationship was to be expressed in designand color.\" 8A building or a wooden spoon was fully functional (or beautiful) only when all aspectsof its effects on users were satisfied by the designedform. This was possible only when the form wasdeveloped \"organically\" from its internal functionand intended user activity, \"as if grown out of theobject itself.\" 9Ideally, the forms designed would not only fulfill but also visually declare their holisti-cally conceived functions. This is an approach todesign that I have called \"organic functionalism.\" 10 Such objects should also be designed so that they\"fit\" artistically into their intended surroundings. Adining room table should not appear the same as alibrary table. Looking at a tablecloth embroideredby a student, Steiner once indicated how specific avisual design could be: \"This is a tablecloth for useon a round table in a reception room in whichguests assemble to drink tea.\" 11 Through efforts along these lines, the artistic ele-ment can arise directly from the everyday practicalactivities of life, from those activities that give theobject or building itself its meaning. Art does notthen remain isolated from ordinary life withinmuseums and galleries but can flow out into dailyexperience. \"Beauty must not remain captive inmuseums,\" announced Steiner. \"Step by step wemust work for its release.\" 12He felt this desired social development, which Waldorf education wasintended to serve, to be important for the veryrenewal of spiritual life within society: It is a matter of great and social significance tomen, that everything by which they are imme-diately surrounded in life should take on anartistic form. Every spoon, every glass, shouldhave a form well adapted to its use, instead of aform chosen at random to serve the purpose.One should see at a glance, from its form, whatservice a thing performs in life, and at the sametime recognize its beauty. Then for the firsttime large numbers of people will feel spirituallife to be a vital necessity, when spiritual lifeand practical life are brought into direct con-nection with each other. . . . art, born of spiri-tual science, [will] attain to the power of givingdirect form to every chair, every table, to everyman-created object. 13 What do these principles mean in actual practice?The following examples from the crafts curricu-lum, primarily from Steiner's own lectures onWaldorf education, will help make the approach of\"organic functionalism\" more concrete and under-standable. After this, we will look briefly at schoolarchitecture.David Adams 25 Embroidery Design Waldorf students usually learn to embroider in the fourth grade, sometimes starting as early as the thirdgrade. In seventh grade they expand this foundationin connection with clothing and sometimes take upmore advanced embroidery in the ninth grade.Steiner once remarked at a teacher's conference,\"There are people who embroider a thing, butwhose embroidery might equally well be on some-thing else.\" 14Organic functionalism demands that an embroidery design express the function of the objectonto which it is embroidered and the relationship ofthat object to the human being. If, for example, the object is an embroidered glove, then one should be able to see that this glove is fora human hand. The asymmetry of the hand\u2014thethicker palm and back of the hand contrasting withthe more slender fingers\u2014as well as the structuralcharacter of the muscles and bones within the hand,can all be expressed, to an extent, in an embroi-dered pattern. Traditional crafts designs often havesomething of this character ( figure 1). It is similar for the foot with the decoration of the slippersoften made in sixth-grade handwork classes, wherethe \"form and coloring must be especially strongand heavy round the heel, for this is where theweight of the body rests most strongly. . . .Towardthe front the motifs should be lighter in color, aswell as round the opening for the foot.\" 15This reflects Steiner's principle that the inside of a usefulobject should be lighter than the outside. 16 Another important principle in relation to thehuman user was expressed in a remark Steiner madeabout an ink-pen wiper, whose surface had beencompletely covered with embroidery by the stu-dent. Rather, he commented, it should have beendesigned to leave a space free for the thumb to takehold of it (as in figure 2). What a person does with his or her hands in using the object must enterinto the embroidered design. It was a basic designprinciple that \"an object should always be lightestin color where a human being has to hold it.\" 17A similar idea applies to the design of an embroideredwallet or needlebook ( figure 3). These principles received an interesting elaborationwith Steiner's comments on the task he set a ninthgrade class to embroider a cushion or pillow. Wequote here in full from a telling report by pioneerWaldorf crafts teacher Hedwig Hauck: This very question\u2014how to embroider cushion\u2014had been by Rudolf Steiner on variousoccasions. \"For,\" he said, \"it can happen when youlie on a modern cushion that you wake up and findthe embroidered pattern imprinted on your cheek.\"In the Christmas lectures given to teachers in 1921he made sketches on the blackboard and said: \"Itisn't possible to lay your head on this cushion ( fig- ure 4), because the thing in the middle will scratchyou! It does not express the real function of acushion at all. This is how it should be done ( fig- ure 5) . . . and now you can only lie with your faceto the right. If it is to be done really artistically, thesame design must be put facing left on the back ofthe cushion\" ( figure 6). All kinds of questions arose among the listeners asto how else a cushion could be artisticallydesigned. It was thought, for example, that itwould be fully in harmony with the function ofthe cushion if it were embroidered only along itsfour edges, for Rudolf Steiner had said inDornach on another occasion that in the middleof the cushion is the human being\u2014nothing isthere\u2014but around him are his dreams. When he was shown a cushion embroidered in this way along its four edges ( figure 7), he laid it flat on his open hand and tried, turning it in allfour directions, to lay his head on it, until he gaveup the attempt and said: \"But how can I get intoit? Here it is closed\u2014there it is closed\u2014it is closedon all sides. One cannot get in at all.'\" Then hetook a pencil, drew a sketch of a cushion ( figure 8), and said: \"It must be embroidered in such away that one can see where the head and the neckshould be. The design must open out towardsthe bottom so that the human body can get in,and in the middle at the top the design opens outagain.\" 18 After he had sketched the embroidery for thecushion he drew a number of short firm strokesalong the bottom seam and said: \"The lower edgemust be strongly emphasized; it must be clearlydefined. The side edges must be too, but less soas you approach the top. The lower edge must be26 Organic Functionalism especially strong (there is no seam along the top). Then on the back of the pillow ( figure 9) you can embroider something in all four corners, or you can embroider in the middle, to show thatone cannot lie there\"( figure 10). 19 Cosies for tea or coffee pots, Steiner noted, shouldhave a lot of reddish color in them to show thatthey are used to keep the beverage warm. 20They should also be designed to show where the openingis located (i.e., below) as well as which end retainsthe heat ( figure 11). 21The same principle would be true in reverse for the workbags often sewn andembroidered in grades 3 or 4 ( figure 12) as well as for handbags or shopping bags. 22 Aside from being designed to fit into its future sur-roundings, a tablecloth should also be designed fora table with a certain number of legs ( figures 13 and 14). Thus, one could see visually for just whatkind of table and purpose a tablecloth was intend-ed. An embroidery design for a dining room table-cloth or placemat ought to leave space for silver-ware and plates, which could be enclosed in a kindof frame whose design took into consideration thenumber of people at the table ( figure 15). Clothing In the seventh grade, and usually for one or twoyears thereafter, Waldorf students learn to makeitems of clothing, first by hand sewing and thenby machine sewing. Steiner encouraged teachersto try to overcome the dictates of current fashionand teach the children to design their own cloth-ing in a freer, more artistic way that expresses arelationship to the specific personality of the wear-er and to the part of the human body involved. One of his favorite examples with regard to cloth- ing design tries to make a clear, functional distinc-tion between the embroidered design for theneckline at the top of a dress and one for the hemat the bottom: You see girls . . . sitting in a needlework classsewing some kind of pattern round the neck,round the waist-band, and round the hem of adress, and one is dismayed to find that it isalways the same pattern! And when you meeta young lady hooped around in this way, shelooks as though she has been squeezed togeth-er by this pattern which is the same above andbelow. Head and feet have been completelyignored, while in fact the pattern ought to bemetamorphosed in accordance with these ( fig- ure 16). 23 In 1922 at Oxford he spoke as follows: The child must learn very early on that a banddesigned for the neck has a tendency to opendownwards, it has a downward direction; that agirdle or waistband tends both upwards anddownwards; and that the lower hem of a dresshas an upward-striving tendency, and musthave a kind of base below upon which itstands. It is a terrible thing if a child is taughtmerely to design a band artistically. The childshould know how the band should lookaccording to its position on the human beingwearing it (figure 17). 24 Furthermore, remarked Steiner, a garment shouldbe lighter toward the top to show a relationship toair and light, and heavier (darker) toward the bot-tom to show a relationship to the ground (likewisefor shoes, which are actually in contact with theground). \"Face and hands express the humanspirit and radiate out, so to speak, so that nearthese, the colors should always be lighter.\" 25In general, he added, it would be good to design agarment to be symmetrical to the central verticalline of the body's front. 26 With regard to clothing accessories, gloves andshoes were already mentioned under \"EmbroideryDesign.\" The design and trimming of a hat shouldlikewise be in keeping with its function. Steinersuggested that the hat designer \"should express thefact that the hat is placed from above downwardsonto the head: it bears a similar relation to thehead as the roof to a house.\" 27A hat \"should sit firmly on the head as though held by it, and, . . . ifthere is a brim, a gentle transition should be madefrom it to the part of the hat close to the head.\" 28 A brim must be bent downward in the back, but infront \"you can bend the brim upwards, so that theface is free of covering. Then even the shape ofthe hat says that it is protecting the head, butallowing a free view into the world.\" 29David Adams 27 Woodwork Throughout the Waldorf woodwork curriculum, which begins in fifth or sixth grade and can contin-ue through twelfth grade, a variety of utilitarianobjects are made by the students. The fundamentalfunctional principles of the design of these objectsare established near the beginning with one of thefirst projects, the carving of a wooden spoon.There, it is important that the handle of the spoonis designed and carved in a somewhat asymmetrical,rounded form that fits comfortably into the shape,size, and grip of the human hand that will use it(figures 18 and 19). An impression of the hand's grasp might be made first in clay as a guide. Thesame principle can be seen in gradually more com-plex projects, such as a small serving bowl ( figures 20 and 21) ; also note how the concentric pattern of tree rings is used to help shape the bowl area)and an unusual knife handle ( figure 22), which fits with remarkable precision into the irregular hollowshape of an adult human hand. (This would morelikely be a letter-opener project in a Waldorfschool.) A few other projects, mostly from later grades, illus- trate the same ideal of fitting the object's design tothe way it will be used by a human being. Carvedcandle holders include handles adapted to the graspof the human hand ( figure 23). A carved wooden box features a broad, overhanging lid with theunderside of the lid grooved to fit a lifting finger(figures 24 and 25). Lids for such boxes can also be carved with suitable indentations for the thumband fingers to lift (figure 26). In their junior and senior years of high school, stu- dents may also begin to create items of furniture. Acommon first project is a three-legged stool withthe seat slightly gouged out to fit the rear end ofthe body that will sit on it. The idea that a chair orother piece of furniture is beautiful only to the eye Steiner called \"an absurd idea.\" Rather, he said,\"We want to feel the chair, feel the beauty of the chair when we sit on it.\" 30Artistic beauty must always arise in close connection to actual use. Book Design In the eleventh grade, Waldorf school studentslearn the art of bookbinding. Steiner placed a highvalue on learning this craft: \"In bookbinding thechildren have to learn how to unite something spiri-tual with the physical.\" 31Ideally, the students first study the content and structure of the book beforebeginning a book cover design. The design willthen arise out of the ideas or story of the bookcombined with the essential nature of the bookcover's function. Steiner's numerous comments on the design of books can only be summarized here. A book cover(or folder) should express its purpose as a cover by being darker than its contents, the pages within.The design of the cover should also show clearlywhich is the top and bottom and which is the frontand back. The supporting back should normally bedarker and less articulated than the front. To pre-pare the reader, the ideal would be to represent theessential content of the book in the cover design.However, the design should be primarily located inthe upper left-hand area of the book cover. Thelower right-hand corner and edge can be leftuncovered by design or text (or perhaps containanother design motif pushing in from outside thecover) in order to indicate where the hand graspsthe cover to open it: \"The place where we touchor take hold of an object should always be lighterthan the rest of it. It will then be as though thehuman being were radiating light.\" One should beable to see from the design of the cover that it ismeant to be opened (for an example, see figure 27). However, commented Steiner, today one sel-dom sees this; rather, books \"usually bear somedesign which actually requires one to leave themshut, not to open them at all.\" 32 In general, an upright oblong shape should be usedfor anything written or printed, while a horizontaloblong shape should be used for drawings and pic-tures (figure 28). A book (or perhaps each chap- ter) might also have an end-vignette on the lastpage to bring the content to a conclusion or tosummarize visually its essential content or mood.Visually, every part of the book design must clearlybelong to the whole. Color in Interior Decoration Steiner once observed that there are many small28 Organic Functionalism household items that can be made by hand and then painted by the students (e.g., lamp shades),paying special attention to the functional role ofcolor within the home environment. As Steinerobserved on a number of occasions, the individualcharacter of each color must be carefully adapted toits particular use: \"If for instance you think of green,\" he said, \"you can easily think of green card-tables.Because a game is a limited, pedantic activity,something very philistine, one can think of suchan arrangement\u2014a room with card-tables cov-ered with green. What I mean is that it wouldbe enough to make you run away if you wereinvited to play cards on a mauve table. On theother hand, a lilac-colored room or a room fur-nished throughout in mauve would lend itselfvery well, shall we say, to mystical conversa-tion\u2014in the best and in the worst sense. . . .Thus we note that by virtue of its own naturecolor has an inner character; whereas greenallows itself to be defined, lilac, peach or fleshcolor tend to spread into vagueness.\" 33 On another occasion he tried to reinforce theimportance of a connection between the aestheticimpact of a color and its particular use: \"I want to say this: if I should enter some-body's dining-room and find people eating therefrom plates which had a red glaze, it would giveme the impression that these were people whowanted to enjoy their food like real gourmets.But if I saw them eating from blue plates then Iwould think they were not gourmets but justhungry people wanting to satisfy their appetite.Somebody else might have another impression,but that is not what matters. What matters is,that everything one meets in life seems to havean aesthetic effect on one. This forms itself intoa sort of faint imagination or vision. . . . Even ifit is not generally true that a party of people eat-ing from plates which are colored red must nec-essarily be a crowd of gourmets, from an aes-thetic point of view it still holds true. In thesame way one could say that if somebodyreceives me in a red room and stands there infront of me without saying a word, being a real-ly dull sort of person, I feel like saying: 'He real-ly lies by receiving me in this red room, becauseit makes me expect somebody there who has alot to say to me and doesn't let me talk all thetime.' It makes him look as if he were deceivingme\u2014his way of living seems a lie to me.\" 34 The particular qualities of each color should also beused in designing wall painting or wall decorationwithin the school. Again, the colors must be relat-ed to functions\u2014either the function of architecturaldetails (such as a warming or intensification of wallcolor toward the entrance to a classroom or begin-ning of a stairway) or to support the educationalfunctions taking place within the classrooms.Steiner provided a number of recommendations forthe specific colors of each classroom, changingthrough the years as the children mature. This idealeads us to consider architecture once again. School Architecture Rudolf Steiner\u2014who himself designed seventeenbuildings and gave more than seventy lectures onarchitecture\u2014often spoke about the powerfuleffects exerted upon us by the buildings in whichwe live, work, study, learn, and shop. He main-tained that the best architectural and utilitariandesign does not arise only from considerations ofstructural and physical functions, but rather shouldbe \"living forms\" that also speak to the emotional,psychological, mental, moral, and spiritual naturesof human users. Architectural forms and spacesshould arise organically from such \"inner functions\"as well as from outer functions. To authenticallyrelate to and nourish these inner dimensions ofhuman experience, argued Steiner, a buildingshould present \"an environment that will expressthe human being's inner being in forms.\" 35 Sculptural forms with dynamism and organic move-ment speak better to the human psyche than do thestatic or geometrical forms of most previous archi-tecture and design. Hard, psychologically opaque,or merely intellectually conceived forms can stirsemiconscious feelings of alienation in their users;they are not experienced as physically or psychologi-cally \"user-friendly.\" What might these ideas mean in practice when applied to the design of a Waldorf school building?First of all, it is important that the artistically basedDavid Adams 29 instruction of the teacher is supported by classroom spaces that are also artistically modeled (and forwhich a standard rectangular room is generally theleast suitable). A more organic architecture offersgreater support to the organically related, mobile,and flexible thought-processes that Waldorf teachershope to develop in their students. But, most essen-tially, the application of these ideas would involveprogressive changes in the floor plans, ceilingdesigns, and overall shapes of classrooms as studentsadvance through the grades and through differentdevelopmental phases (see figures 29, 30, and 31 for examples of such plans). The progression of rooms begins with the simply whole, unitary, roundish spaces of the kindergartenand preschool, reflecting and welcoming the chil-dren's experience of the world during those years.Not only the entire room, but the windows, doors,ceiling, and furnishings can have a rounded orcurved form (figure 32). That which is softer, more rounded, and more uni- fied in the preschool and early elementary years willgradually become firmer, more articulated, andmore angular as students advance through theirschooling. Appropriate classroom murals, wall pic-tures, and colors should also change through thegrades, as described by Steiner. 36For example, the walls of the first-grade classroom would be paintedin warmer, reddish colors and feature images fromfairy tales. By contrast, the walls of the sixth-graderoom would be painted in cooler, bluish colors andfeature images of the individual human being, espe-cially a human being in nature (\"a man standing ina landscape in sunshine or rain; or a small lake witha man rowing on it,\" suggested Steiner). Being sur-rounded during each school day by pedagogicallyappropriate wall paintings can exert a powerfulcounter-force to the less helpful influence of the tel-evision, film, and advertising images that flood theexperience of most students today. 37In a similar way all of the visible elements of a building's design\u2014lighting, doorways, corridors, stairwells, materi-als, arrangement of spaces, and so on\u2014can beshaped out of an awareness of their role within theeducational functions of the structure. But what about the form of a school building as a whole? Although I could profitably discuss exam-ples of Steiner's own buildings to make clear whathis design principles might mean in architecturalpractice, 38the Rudolf Steiner School in Ittigen, Switzerland, provides an excellent example of how awhole building can manifest these design principles.Located just outside Bern, this school building wascompleted in 1977 and was the design product ofarchitects Arthur Bieri and Gerhard Egger workingclosely with Eckhart D\u00f6nges, a sculpture andeurythmy teacher at the school. The three-levelbuilding is carefully related to its surrounding envi-ronment\u2014on the one hand, to the alpine mountainvistas on all sides ( figure 33) and, on the other, to a traditional broad-roofed Swiss farmhouse thatstands nearby on the same property (figures 34 and 35). The school building is threefold in over-all conception, with a center section flanked by twolong wings. This configuration expresses the essen-tial function of the building: a nurturing, motherlygesture of protection as the two \"arms\" of theschool building embrace the broad plaza in front ofthe school where children (and parents) often gath-er. This same gesture is repeated in a sculpturalmotif over the central doorway ( figure 36) as well as in the framing for the auditorium stage and therailing for the rear balcony, where orchestra or choirare frequently positioned during school assembliesand performances ( figures 37 and 38 ). Unlike many featureless, rectangular modern build-ings, the Rudolf Steiner School clearly announcesits main entrance in bold, projecting forms andclearly identifies its front and back sides (see figures 36 and 39). The rounded contours and fluidlymodeled stairs of this entrance invite the visitor tomove easily upward and into the school. Even thedoor handles support the welcoming expression(figure 40). Spaces for the hand to fit comfortablyinside are carved out of each wooden door, and theright-hand indentation is cut and articulated some-what more sharply than the left-hand one. This isan expression of the fact that most people are right-handed and, thus, more awake on their right side.The handles on the inside of the door are shapedlike large, simple buttons, making it visually obviousthat one pushes them to open the door, even as theforms on the outside express that they must begrasped and pulled. The organic visual designdirectly tells the user the function of the door with30 Organic Functionalism no need for \"push\" or \"pull\" signs. In the entrance lobby tall, muscular columns clearly and reassuringly support the somewhat low, \"child-scale\" ceiling. They also provide an architecturalimage of the kind of \"wakeful uprightness\" that wehope students will adopt as they make the transitionfrom outdoors to their classrooms ( figure 41). On the stairways dynamically interpenetrating formsencourage the students to keep moving up or downthe stairs ( figure 42). The doorways to each class- room feature organically-designed frames whoseflared bases express their solid foundations. Theangularly curved tops reflect the natural humanexperience of a curved sphere above\u2014whether wethink of this as our own head or the sky ( figure 43). Both the shape of the doorway and the typeof wood used change as students progress throughthe classrooms of different grades, moving fromrounded to more angular and wakeful forms. 39 The classrooms are arranged within the building inaccordance with an awareness of the qualities of dif-ferent spatial directions. Rooms for the moreearth-related lessons (such as the sciences, garden-ing, physical education, woodwork, and metalwork)are located on the ground floor. Classrooms forgrades one through twelve are located on the main(second) floor, moving from east to west. Thespaces for more aesthetic or refined subjects, such asmusic, eurythmy, painting, and sculpture, are locat-ed on the upper floor. To give but one example ofan individual classroom, one of the two eurythmyrooms shows how it echoes the graceful, rhythmicmovements of that art while the element ofuprightness is reinforced by sculptural pilastersalong the side walls (figure 44). The room uses radiant heating provided by a network of waterpipes beneath the flooring. This system provides aneven, cozy heat, particularly for the feet of the mov-ing eurythmists. The Ittigen building demonstrateshow architecture can make an important and posi-tive contribution to the process of education. Conclusion The examples discussed above should make clearthe essential design principle that Steiner intendedto be used equally within the Waldorf crafts curricu-lum and in the school building's architecture:Every form is sensitively adapted to the nature ofthe human beings who use them. But this \"organicfunctional\" aspect of Steiner's artistic hopes forWaldorf education has been much neglected inNorth America. For example, in the recently pub-lished book Will-Developed Intelligence: Handworkand Practical Arts in the Waldorf School, although many benefits of Waldorf crafts instruction are dis-cussed, there is hardly a mention of this designapproach, which for Steiner was to be one of thechief guiding principles of education in the crafts. 40 This principle was to be a means for \"ennobling\"children's feelings for color, form, and line alreadyduring the elementary school years so that theycould bring an unspoiled sense of practical beautywith them into their life activities and thereby grad-ually transform the design of our surroundings tosomething more enlivening and harmonious. 41At the same time the progressing crafts curriculumcould help to gently lead children into a more prag-matic, \"down-to-earth\" relationship to their stillnew earthly home, as noted by Michael Martin:\"The child is borne into life on the stream of beau-ty; it is the guarantee against succumbing to the'merely useful' on earth. But the human being mustenter the other stream, coming from the earthitself, must connect with the necessities anddemands of life.\" 42 In the end, design measures such as these\u2014whetherintroduced at the \"micro\" level of crafts instructionor at the \"macro\" level of school architecture\u2014notonly hold the promise of best supporting the devel-opmentally-based educational tasks of the Waldorfschool but also of helping to bring an artistic ele-ment into the design of our larger everyday sur-roundings and buildings, a design element that willgradually make them worthy of the human being asa being of soul and spirit as well as body.

In December of 2003 the magazine Erziehungskunst (The Art of Education) pub- lished an article on the salutogenetic project \"Gesundheitsf\u00f6rderende P\u00e4dagogik\" (PedagogyPromoting Health), which was undertaken thatautumn (2003) by pedagogical research sectionof the Bund der Freien Waldorfschulen (Associationof Waldorf Schools in Germany) and the Institutefor Pedagogy, Ecology of the Senses, and MediaStudies in Stuttgart. The project was commissionedby the German Association of Waldorf Schools, theInternational Association of Waldorf Kindergartens,the Society for Anthroposophical Physicians inGermany, the Medical Section, and the PedagogicalSection at the Goetheanum. The impetus for theproject was given by the impending lowering of theschool age in various states in Germany. Bothschool doctors and Waldorf teachers are worriedabout this because the anthroposophical view of thehuman being is quite specific in this matter.Academic learning is not to be started at an arbi-trary point: when one starts too early, growthforces are used up which should in fact still be usedto form the physical constitution. Starting earlier isdone at the expense of these vital forces and thusjeopardizes the further development of the child.With the health of many modern children beingtaxed enough as it is, a further threat could beformed by the additional stress of lowering the ele-mentary school age by a full year.Therefore an initiative group, consisting of physi-cians, scientists, and people working out ofWaldorf pedagogy, set itself the task to engage inscientific research on young children to investigatethe connection between the development of ahealthy constitution and the development of learn-ing. Reports in three areas were planned from theinception; the work has progressed in the mean-time, and in this article we would like to reporthow far we have come. Should School Age Also Be Lowered in Waldorf Schools? In the autumn of 2003 we sent out a relatively wide- ranging questionnaire in order to gain an idea of theviews held by kindergarten teachers and lower gradecolleagues in different areas of Germany with regardto the present-day pedagogical situation. We wantedto know what their experience told them concerningthe question of children starting school earlier, and,especially, what long-term changes they have noticedin child development. It became obvious that these questions have conse-The Lowering of School Age and the Changes in Childhood: An Interim Report Claudia McKeen, Reiner Patzlaff, and Martyn Rawson This is a translation of an article that appeared in the German journal, Erziehungskunst, Vol. 5 (2004), and is published here by permission of the authors. 40 The Lowering of School Age and the Changes in Childhood quences for the future position of the Waldorf schools and Waldorf kindergartens, consequencesthat also extend into the area of politics. For in sev-eral states in Germany, preparations are underway instate schools for children to begin elementary schoolat an earlier age. And not only that: it will also nolonger be possible to allow children to repeat agrade. Until recently, children could be put back ayear, but this will be forbidden in the near future,with very few exceptions. It is already quite a com-mon occurrence that parents are given the option tosend their five-year-old to school earlier if they wishto do so (the so-called \"Kann-Kinder\" [able chil-dren]); in cases where parents avail themselves of thatopportunity, there is no way back. Even though the Waldorf schools are not obliged by law to join in lowering the elementary schoolage, they would still have to comply with the banon sending children back a grade. This raises thequestion of how Waldorf schools can still attractstudents in the future, when they stick to the tradi-tional school age and refuse to take children a yearearlier. Would not such a position be doomed tofailure from the start? This also brings up a hard question for the Waldorf kindergartens: How will life in the kindergarten beaffected by this? How will it be when the group ofoldest children\u2014often called the \"royal children\" inGermany\u2014are no longer there, because they havealready gone on to elementary school? Would itnot be much better pedagogically to continue tocarry this age group in the kindergarten, but in aform specifically tailored to them? This might bedone in such a way that from the outside it wouldlook like an ordinary grade and involve elementaryschool teachers from a Waldorf school close by.However, in actual practice, such a class would belocated in the trusted environment of the kinder-garten. It would, of course, probably not be possi-ble in every case to find the Waldorf school neededwith which to cooperate, and even if that were pos-sible, Waldorf schools often object, justly, that itwould be necessary to institute a \"grade zero\" inorder to be able to take in children who do notcome from a Waldorf kindergarten. However, ifthere were such a grade zero, most of the five orsix-year-olds (and their parents, respectively) wouldthen likely want to press ahead from kindergarteninto the \"real school.\" Instituting a transition classin the kindergarten would then be unnecessary,unless the kindergarten were in the same location asthe rest of the school. A multiplicity of funda-mental questions such as these would arise. With respect to the discussion concerning these issues, a discussion which has already started, theresearch group would like to stress that it does notconsider it to be its task to find the right organiza-tional form, imposed from above as it were, inorder to meet the changed situation. Every institu-tion will have to decide these matters for itself, tak-ing into account the local conditions and individualpossibilities. The research group should be workingtogether with their colleagues to tackle the questionof how to shape the transition pedagogically fromearly childhood into elementary school age. That isto say, how do we safeguard the developmentaldemands of the child when we shape a healthy andsensible transition, independent of the organization-al form in which it takes place? Hence it was of great importance for us to begin first of all by getting input from colleagues who areactually working with children between the ages ofthree and nine and to find out how they judge thepresent-day situation from a pedagogical point ofview. The first results of our questionnaire give thefollowing picture. An Assessment of the Situation in the Kindergarten From the questionnaire we sent out, we were able to incorporate results up to March 25, 2004. Wereceived responses from a total of 153 early child-hood educators from 126 German Waldorfpreschools. It was especially interesting to noticethe strong response to the question, \"Have younoticed changes in child development during thepast 10 years?\" What follows is a summary of themost frequent responses. There is a noticeable decrease in children's ability to imitate and to play and in the power of imagination. Children's health is weaker, they are more nervous and fearful, and there is an increase inallergies and infections. In motor movement, there is less dexterity, a slowing in development, and more feebleness. Children play differently; they are louder and wilder.Claudia McKeen, Reiner Patzlaff, and Martyn Rawson 41 Children talk a lot, are slow to get going, and have a hard time listening. Today's children are very much individuals, strongly developed intellectually, and awake in their heads. They often have no sense of boundaries and are very much oriented towards adults; their capacity for devotion is less. Social skills and thoughtfulness can be counted on less. It is noticeable that the enumeration of weaknesses and deficits predominates. The number of childrenhaving deficits such as the ones listed above is esti-mated to be very high (between 50 and 70 per-cent). A comparable list of new capacities, whichcan be valued positively, is generally absent. Arethere none? Or should we have asked for themmore explicitly? Likewise, educators gave very differentiated answers to the question: \"What would happen if childrenaged five and one-half to seven were missing fromthe group, because they would be attending apreparatory class or would be in elementary school?\"The tenor of the answers was usually as follows: Younger children would miss the example of the older ones. Much would be missing in the way of child culture, stimulus for playing, and richness of ideas. Forming habits in the rhythm of the day and the course of the seasons, including also the carrying out of practical activities such as washing hands and dressing, would be much more difficult without the older children who remember how to do that. The grown-ups would have to demonstrate much more, or explain. It would only be beneficial for many children to have a third year in the kindergarten and thus remain longer in the activity of playing. It would increase the number of younger children in every group, which would mean asignificant change in the structure of the groups; groups would be much more difficultto manage. A different opinion: there would be more peace and quiet in the kindergarten and the little ones would be able to play more in an age appropriate way. Something would be taken away from the older children, and this would especially affect the great number who are only children. They would be missing out on the social practice of learning with and from the little children in sharing responsibility and developing care and empathy. They would not be able to feel pride about their own abilities, nor would the resulting strengtheningof self-confidence be able to unfold. On the other hand, if the older children were in a group by themselves, they would not have to put up with waiting times. Special chal-lenges could be arranged for them and they could be occupied with age appropriate activi-ties (something which often is presently takingplace in cases where special days or programs are arranged for the older children). Early childhood educators in Waldorf kindergartensare predominantly of the opinion that the conceptfor the kindergarten as it has existed up to nowwould come into question if kindergarten no longerincorporated the five and six year-olds. This agegroup is seen as an essential part of the culture of thekindergarten, and its absence would mean disadvan-tages for all children. However, many kindergartenteachers and administrators feel the lack of a closercooperation with the schools which take in their chil-dren, and they are worried that the input of earlychildhood educators would not be heard at all ifpreparatory classes were to be established. How Do Things Stand in Elementary Schools? We received forms with answers to our questionnaire from 84 German elementary Waldorf schools. Inthese, we likewise found that the question \"Did youperceive general changes in child development duringthe past five years?\" found a wide response.Frequent observations were: There are still many \"sound,\" healthy children, but the number of \"unhealthy\" children is increasing. Children have less dexterity than used to be the case. Coordination, fine and gross motor 42 The Lowering of School Age and the Changes in Childhood movements are less strongly developed (for example when children hop or stand on one leg). Illnesses are more frequent, children suffer pains, are pale, tired, or have indefinite bellyaches or headaches. The powers of imitation have waned. Even simple instructions are hard to follow for many children. The power of imagination has definitely become weaker. Concentration is bad; children have a hard time listening and their memories are weak. Children are restless; they cannot sit still. The sense of the rhythm is often weakly developed. The development of speech is often retarded (for example: a smaller vocabulary, use of shorter sentences, uncertainties in grammar, and retelling stories is becoming harder). Not only were deficits noticed by teachers, but, inaddition, a number of quite different, remarkablechanges were registered as well. A much more individual approach has become necessary in the lower grades. There is a stronger need for personal attention, often connected with a lack of boundaries and a decrease in perception of social needs. The difference between boys and girls has become much more noticeable (90 percent of the difficult children are boys). When entering the school, many more children than before know their letters and can even read. Children show strong practical abilities, they want to be outside and want to have more timefor play. Children are more spontaneous and open in their contact with the world. They are often sensitive, delicate, very awake, and also critical at this early age. They have a strong longing for spiritual matters and are often very spiritually oriented. They are more independent than they used to be, do not want guidance, yet look for orientation. \"The Rubicon\" (the developmental step in the ninth year, which involves the child becoming more distant towards the world) occurs earlier,as can be seen from the distance they show towards the teacher and also from related matters. As in the case of the questionnaire for the early child-hood educators, the teachers were likewise asked toconsider how the lowering of school-age wouldaffect their schools. What follows are typical answersgiven to the question \"What, in your opinion, wouldthe effect be for your school of lowering school entryto age five?\" We find no positive aspects to the projected change and cannot assess how we would deal with it. We would be forced to establish a grade zero (a preschool or entry-level class). We would not be able to get around accepting five-year-olds. It would be necessary to collaborate more closely with the kindergarten. The traditional Waldorf kindergarten would have to be rethought and tackled in a different way. The curriculum we have used up to now would not apply to the school anymore, and itwould be necessary to think of different educational concepts. (The model of the school in Bochum and team teaching were frequently mentioned.) The existing architectural layout of the school would no longer be functional and a complete remodeling would be necessary. It would be necessary to work with smaller classes and more therapeutic assistance would likewise be needed. Parental involvement would have to be intensified. There was general unanimity in the conclusionteachers came to: we will not be able to avoidestablishing preschool classes. It will entail Martyn Rawson 43 pedagogical concepts; however, the necessary research will have to be done both by local schoolcommunities and on a regional level. Preliminary Conclusions of the Questionnaire It is clear that Waldorf schools are facing a new task: the transition from kindergarten to elementaryschool will have to be thoroughly rethought andshaped anew. On the surface, the point seems to beto find an organizational form which can meet thechanged political requirements. Much more impor-tant, however, are the clearly stated grounds to turnour full energy towards this task for reasons whichhave nothing to do with political pressure. Againand again we are facing a host of well-known symp-toms which are being reported in kindergartens andschools. All of them point to the fact that the con-stitution of present-day children has changed con-siderably. Children are different both in body andsoul, and this is certainly to be connected with thechanged circumstances created by adults (this, how-ever, was not what the questionnaire was about).Children bring completely new conditions, demands, and problems into schools, newer thanwas the case 10 or 20 years ago, and therefore theyneed to be met pedagogically in a new way in order to do justice to our present time. But how do we get there? Colleagues see three things which would be needed: 1) Collaboration between kindergartens and elementary schools must be much more intensive than has been the case up to now. 2) We must work at the pedagogical concepts, basing ourselves in proper research which takes into account how the human being develops andincorporates pedagogical and medicinal viewpoints. 3) Parents and teachers must work together more strongly. Project 1: Pedagogical Model for Education between Age Three and Nine The preliminary results of the questionnaire have reinforced the intention of the research group towork together with the representatives of schools and kindergartens to create a pedagogical modelthat does not follow the traditional divisionbetween kindergarten and elementary school.Instead, the model should include the period goingfrom the beginning of kindergarten up to the timeof \"The \"Rubicon.\" In so doing, the developmentof the child from age three up to nine is seen as anongoing process of formation and education. In creating such a model, we have several targets in mind. On the one hand, it should offer colleagueswho are working with this age group workable cri-teria based on real insight into child development,criteria which can serve to orient them in concretelyshaping the transition from kindergarten into ele-mentary school. On the other hand, it should offerparents criteria which clarify viewpoints coming out of Waldorf pedagogy, in order to help them makeup their minds when they want to send their childto elementary school (insofar as they will still havethe political freedom to choose in this matter). Thethird aim is that this research should make ourviewpoints clear vis-a-vis the outside world. Severalstates are currently preparing educational modelsfor early childhood education that will soon becomeanchored in law. Because of this, Waldorf kinder-gartens will see themselves, in the near future, facedwith the necessity to formulate pedagogical modelswhich are in harmony with their practices. This for-mulation of pedagogical aims will only be accept-able to the public when it is based on the latest sci-entific research. A work such as this cannot beaccomplished by kindergartens on their own andtherefore calls for a task force spanning the separateregions. In the autumn of 2003, a larger group of colleagues from kindergartens and elementary schools cametogether and accomplished considerable preparatorywork. It became more and more clear that the edu-cational model we are striving for within the cur-rent political developments will only have the neces-sary weight and find acceptance when it is officiallyendorsed by the participating institutions and is for-mulated on their behalf. It is for that reason thatwe asked the boards of the German Waldorf SchoolAssociation and the International Association forWaldorf Kindergartens to augment the existingworking groups, which primarily work together on44 The Lowering of School Age and the Changes in Childhood a regional level, with competent representatives from the whole of Germany and thus lift the workto a federal level. We also asked the boards to givethis total grouping a formal mandate to draw upthe pedagogical aims, so that a document can comeinto being to which the whole of the Waldorfmovement can adhere. Project 2: Standardized Criteria For School Entry In the second target area of the project, the research group seeks to investigate if it is possible toshow scientifically whether there is a connectionbetween the point at which a child enters schooland the subsequent medical and educational historyof that child. If so, can any conclusions be drawnfrom it? A considerable database will be needed toaccomplish this, one which still has to be created bytracking the detailed development of as many chil-dren as possible at the point of school entry andcomparing that data with later data. It should alsobe possible to compare this information with datacollected from official bureaus of health. The prerequisite for the validity of the data, howev- er, is that the research be carried out according tostandardized criteria, which is something new forGerman Waldorf schools. In order to accomplishthis, Claudia McKeen has been working on a stan-dardized research form and has placed this at thedisposal of German Waldorf schools as a pilot proj-ect to be used by colleagues responsible for schoolentry in the various schools, with the request toincorporate and use the indicated research criteriain their own newly undertaken research into schoolreadiness procedures. From the fullness of reliablecriteria, we selected, in particular, those items whichappeared to indicate strongly whether the vitalforces shaping the body have become free or not.Some of the questions were taken from the researchform used by the Board of Health in Cologne inorder to facilitate comparison with official data at alater point in time. We are also planning, in connection with project 2, a retrospective study, which will investigate thedevelopment and health of the youngest and oldestchildren in a given class. This project will have toincorporate data from as many classes as possibleand span as many years as possible.Project 3: Salutogenetic Research The 3rd project area aims to do research to investi-gate the connection between the development of ahealthy constitution and the educational process.First contacts are being made with experts in thefield of epidemiology and with study leaders whohave experience with scientific studies of this kind.In addition we are presently in touch withresearchers of body rhythm, who have developednew instruments and methods that observe heart-beat-breath ratios. These observations could giveus the ability to recognize subtle influences thataffect children in school and to detect how definite,clearly definable activities, educational content andmethods work to strengthen or weaken health. Incontrast to the kind of long-term research whichcan only show a general correlation between healthand educational methods, styles, and so forth, andis questionable in its methodology, this kind ofstudy could lead to a direct and measurable correla-tion between a quite definite detail of education orof the instructional process and a strengthening orweakening of the health of the child. We hope tohave a concrete plan with this intention in place inthe next months. Claudia McKeen, M.D. worked as the school physician for the Uhlandsh\u00f6he Waldorf School in Stuttgart and presently works at the Institute For Pedagogy, Ecology ofthe Senses, and Media Studies (IPSUM) in Stuttgart. Dr. Rainer Patzlaff worked for a long time as a Waldorf teacher, media researcher and publicist. Since 2001, he has led the Institute For Pedagogy, Ecology of the Senses, and Media Studies (IPSUM) in Stuttgart, whichhe founded. Martyn Rawson worked for over 25 years as a class teacher, speech teacher, and high school teacher in Great Britain and Germany. Since 2003, he has taught at theFreie Hochschule Stuttgart, at the seminar for Waldorfpedagogy, and at the pedagogical research department ofthe Association for Waldorf Schools in Stuttgart. It has been a busy summer for the Waldorf Online Library (OWL). In May I began work-ing to redesign the website with the help of Tom Beauchamp, a Waldorf graduate whom I hadworked with during my time as Managing Editor ofRenewal. Tom is a Waldorf lifer, having graduated from the Sacramento Waldorf High School andUniversity of California at Santa Cruz with a degreein fine arts. He has worked as a graphic designerand website designer for the past ten years. Tomfacilitated the new page layout based on my input. The new home page allows OWL to highlight new resources and additions to the website, and theseare the areas where we have seen the greatest inter-est these past months. The dissertation byStephanie Brooks, \"Establishing Successful andHealthy Teacher and Parent Relationships inWaldorf Schools,\" has by far had the greatest num-ber of hits and the largest number of inquiries fromall over the world! The comments from site visitorswho read this piece online indicate to me that simi-lar articles would be greatly welcomed by Waldorfschool communities. Since the website was redesigned, the number of comments, questions, and inquiries has risen steadi-ly. A slow day for me is just three or four peoplewriting to OWL. I now have correspondence withindividuals in a number of countries: thePhilippines, China, Australia, Holland, and, ofcourse, a great many in the United States. Thequestions and inquiries are varied, but I have beengrateful to have on my bookcase a copy of eachbook, article, or journal that we have on the site.For me, personally, it is so gratifying to be able toanswer these questions that come to OWL, and Iutilize the actual book resources much as any librar-ian would. In the early spring I receive a lot ofquestions from students doing research; in the sum-mer I hear mostly from teachers; and in the fall andwinter, it is the parents and teachers who are online and looking for information. I feel we are ableto offer many of the resources that our visitors arelooking for. My online consultants continue to bevery helpful. Eric Fairman, a longtime Waldorfteacher in Australia, has now joined the consultantgroup. In addition, I have been focusing on adding the great volume of articles in the archives of the manyjournals we make available to the search database.In the past these have been only available by goingdirectly to the particular journal and scrollingthrough all the past issues, a cumbersome and time-consuming task for the site visitor. Recently addedto the site are the Foundations of Waldorf Education series from Steiner Press. These can be found under \"Books in pdf format\" in the Searchsection, as well as by individual title and author.Roberto Trostli has graciously contributed a num-ber of his original plays for the elementary grades, The Online Waldorf Library www.waldorflibrary.org Marianne Alsop 46 The Online Waldorf Library along with birthday verses; all have been very well received, judging by the number of hits these itemsreceive. The OWL site now has some 400 books in English in the search database, with an ever-increasing num-ber of new books being added every week. Myrequest for more original plays, curriculum notes,and stories have not yielded the hoped-for results.Many Waldorf teachers are self-publishing theirwork, which we do make available on the OWL siteas a book resource that can be purchased. I contin-ue to encourage teachers to share their writings thatcan be offered freely with us. It became very evident during the initial phase of redesign that the database, as Dave Alsop had creat-ed it, and which has served us well for these pastyears, needed to be overhauled. We now have somany kinds of data to store and to make accessiblethat I asked Terry Donahue, a local databasedesigner, to expand the database capacity and wordsearch capability. This is an ongoing upgrade thatTerry and I continue to work on. He has made iteasier to add data on my side of things, but thereare still some bugs that we are working on, theelimination of which will allow for faster, moreaccurate searches very soon. We continue to average 2,000 visitors a month, with the majority of our visitors coming from theUnited States and Canada. International usage iscontinuing to be strong with a number of new visi-tors from small island countries: Trinidad/Tobago,Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Samoa, as well as thelarger countries of Macedonia, China, and Vietnam.It does appear that individuals interested in Waldorfeducation are finding us on line! Site visitors over the past few months have asked for more information (free information) about Waldorfschool administration, parenting topics, therapeuticmovement, and foreign language study. There arealso still quite a number of requests for informationabout student evaluation and how Waldorf schools\"test.\" In California, there have been no new, independent Waldorf schools founded for nearly three years, onlynew, public-based charter schools using Waldorfmethods. I receive a number of questions eachweek from parent groups working to establish thesepublic-based schools. These groups are reinterpret-ing the Waldorf curriculum to suit the needs oftheir public school systems, something that hascaused quite a bit of confusion. I continue to be extremely enthusiastic about the Online Waldorf Library. There is a wonderful com-munity of people interested in Waldorf education inthe world. I feel we are becoming more and moreconnected through venues like OWL. It is reallybecoming a place to share ideas and comments, notjust a place to look something up. I welcome sug-gestions as to how I can continue to improve thesite. The Research Institute for Waldorf Education is an initiative on behalf of theWaldorf movement. It has received support and guidance from the Pedagogical Section of theSchool of Spiritual Science and financial supportthrough the Association of Waldorf Schools ofNorth America (AWSNA), the Midwest SharedGifting Group and the Waldorf Schools Fund. The Research Institute was founded in 1996 in order to deepen and enhance the quality of Waldorfeducation, to engage in serious and sustained dia-logue with the wider educational-cultural communi-ty and to support research that would serve educa-tors in all types of schools in their work with chil-dren and adolescents. The Research Institute has responded to the call for research as a top priority of the Waldorf move-ment by becoming a supporting organization ofAWSNA and by co-sponsoring research projectswith the Association. We have supported research projects that deal with essential contemporary educational issues such asattention-related disorders, trends in adolescentdevelopment and innovations in the high schoolcurriculum, learning expectations and assessment,computers in education, the role of art in educationand new ways to identify and address differentlearning styles. The Research Institute has sponsored colloquia andconferences that have brought together educators, psychologists, doctors, and social scientists. We havepublished a Research Bulletin twice a year for the last nine years, and we are developing and distribut-ing educational resources to help teachers in allaspects of their work. The Research Institute is a 501(c) (3) tax-exempt organization.

Visit us at- www.waldorfresearchinstitute.org Of the many subjects taught in the eight- year cycle of a class teacher, few are morechallenging than the science main lessons of the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades. These main lessonsarise at a time when pupils are developing a muchstronger ability to perceive the world as being sepa-rate from themselves; this capacity is crucial for sci-entific enquiry. To help cultivate in their pupils these powers of per- ception in a healthy way, Waldorf teachers approachscience by means of a method different from what istypically used in more traditional schools. Said sim-ply, this method is \"phenomena centered\" ratherthan based on the testing and application of theo-ries.* While most Waldorf teachers will have heard ofthis approach, few will have experienced this methodthemselves as school children, and many may havemade only fleeting acquaintance with this approachduring their teacher training. As a result, teachingscience in Waldorf grade school classes is not alwayssufficiently strong or rigorous to satisfy the needs ofyoung adolescents.A new part-time course\u2014entitled \"TeachingSensible Science\"\u2014will be offered during this com-ing school year to help teachers develop a deeperunderstanding and experience of phenomena-basedscience so that they can feel more confident usingthis method in their own classrooms. Course workwill consist of: Workshops and discussions on the foundations of a phenomenological approach to science (primarily the physical sciences) Practical sessions with experienced class teachers who will demonstrate these methods and help participants prepare class experiments and demonstrations for use in their own classrooms Artistic classes: drawing for the main lesson book, eurythmy Daily question and answer sessions to review the day's work.
