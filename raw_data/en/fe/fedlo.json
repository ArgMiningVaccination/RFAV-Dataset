January 5-7, 1998 Panel PapersA Message From the Assistant Attorney General \"What can the Federal Government do to decrease crime and revitalize communi- ties?\" This is a question policymakers, practitioners, and researchers have debatedfor more than 30 years. Over the past few years, the Justice Department's Office ofJustice Programs (OJP) has brought together former administrators of OJP and itspredecessor agencies and a broad range of other criminal justice experts to examine Federal criminal justice assistance over the past three decades and what lessons this experience holds as we move to shape criminal justice policy for the future. In January 1998, OJP posed this question to a group of practitioners and researchers at a symposium sponsored by two OJP components\u2014the Executive Office for Weedand Seed (EOWS) and the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). This session broughttogether those who are thinking and writing about crime from a practice or research perspective. It was a result of ongoing collaboration between NIJ, our research agency, and Weed and Seed, one of the Department's premiere community-basedinitiatives. It marked the first time these two OJP components have come together tofocus on the issue of crime and its impact on communities, and I commend EOWSDirector Stephen Rickman and NIJ Director Jeremy Travis for their vision and en-ergy in designing this symposium. I also want to thank the symposium participants for taking the time to ponder and discuss this critical question\u2014and for their recommendations on how we should besetting priorities, what role the Federal Government should play, how OJP can bestprovide leadership and demonstrate new programs, what approaches are provingsuccessful, what factors we need to learn more about, and what questions ourresearch should be trying to answer. It is so important for those of us at the Federal level to listen to those of you in the field\u2014to see programs in action, to talk to people on the frontlines, and to get abetter understanding of what's working, what's not, and what's needed. The AttorneyGeneral strongly believes that this kind of engagement is critical if we are going tokeep our Federal programs responsive to the communities they serve, and I have yetto meet anyone \"beyond the Beltway\" who disagrees. These are critical and complex issues we must continue to assess if criminal justice is to be prepared to meet the challenges of the future. I hope you will find that theproducts of our EOWS/NIJ symposium can help make a contribution to this ongoingdebate.

The National Institute of Justice is a component of the Office of Justice Programs, which also includes the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Office of Juvenile Justice and DelinquencyPrevention, and the Office for Victims of Crime.Jeremy Travis NIJ Director Stephen Rickman EOWS Director\u00e4\u00e4 iiiIntroduction We are pleased to present this volume of panel papers from the January 1998 Depart- ment of Justice symposium, \"What Can the Federal Government Do To DecreaseCrime and Revitalize Communities,\" which was jointly sponsored by the NationalInstitute of Justice (NIJ) and the Executive Office for Weed and Seed (EOWS).While NIJ and EOWS often collaborate, this partnership was a unique opportunityfor us to highlight important research, discuss problems facing the Nation's commu- nities, and share some of the imaginative solutions to address them that are being implemented by cities and towns across the country. Conference participants dis-cussed various ways to effectively address the needs of changing communities andinitiated dialogues that we hope will continue. We were delighted to host the speakers whose papers are included here. We were equally pleased with the active involvement of program participants who listened, questioned, and made observations about the speakers' presentations. Teaming with EOWS to achieve the goal of reducing crime and revitalizing commu- nities is a natural extension of NIJ's research, evaluation, and development missionand activities. It also reflects one of NIJ's strategic challenges that focuses on under-standing the nexus between crime and its social context. The Weed and Seed strategyis essentially a coordination effort, making a wide range of public- and private-sector resources more accessible to communities. With the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys, the strategy brings together Federal, State, and local crimefighting agencies, socialservices providers, representatives of the public and private sectors, prosecutors,businessowners, and neighborhood residents\u2014linking them in a shared goal of\"weeding\" out violent crime and gang activity while \"seeding\" the target area withsocial services and economic revitalization. The strategy combines law enforcement; community policing; prevention, intervention, and treatment; and neighborhood restoration. EOWS also provides a range of training and technical assistance activi-ties to help communities plan, develop, and implement their programs. CombiningEOWS' community focus with NIJ's research and development expertise made thissymposium exceptionally productive. This volume is intended to share the beneficial outcomes resulting from the sympo- sium. It is our belief that discussions begun between participants at this conference will lead to action at the community level. It is our hope that these actions will pro-vide new, creative, and effective approaches to address the issues of crime preventionand community revitalization that concern all of us.

Indeed, the movement of more than 2 millionpeople each day across national borders and thegrowth of international commerce are inevitablyassociated with the transfer of health risks, includ-ing such obvious examples as infectious diseases, contaminated foodstuffs, and terrorism, which have multiple dimensions and a broad spectrum ofimpacts\u2014some subtle, some overt. Transnational connections in health imply that health threats, including violence, can no longerbe contained by national frontiers; most diseases do not require passports to travel. Due to the ease of rapid travel, emerging diseases in one countryrepresent a threat to the health and economies ofall countries. In the United States, local communityleaders are now seeing clear evidence that thesuburbs, which sprang up as an \"escape\" from the stress of urban decay, are themselves feeling the impact of \"city ills.\" This was clearly delineated ina recent Wall Street Journal article headed, \"More Suburbs Find City Ills Don't Respect City Limits.\" 1 Demographics At the same time, the demographic picture ischanging. Demography is the study of the size, composition, and distribution of human populations. Although quantitative methods are employed, de-mography is also centrally concerned with the qualityof human populations, such as their health status. Itshould be noted that demographic trends are alreadycausing an increase in the demand for health services and altering the character of the demand. The U.S. Bureau of the Census estimates that the United States population increased by 2.4 millionpeople in 1997 to 268,921,733 as of January 1,1998. The projection is based on the number ofbirths (3.9 million), the number of deaths (2.3 mil- lion), and the number of people returning orThis brief discussion will review, in broad outline, selected health parameters of the context within which efforts to reduce crime and revitalize com- munities must be pursued. My principal underlying thesis is that health condi- tions, the health status of populations, and the ser-vices available to address them are among the keydeterminants of community stability, economic viability, and the incidence of crime. Indeed, when the history of the 1990s is written, health status andaccess to health care for large segments of the pop-ulation in the Nation's urban centers will appearrepeatedly in many chronicles. Along with picturesof the homeless, the charts and tables of the rates of acute and chronic diseases and premature death among the poor and disadvantaged will illustratemany texts about crime, community instability, andfamily disruption. These data will also illustratethat the lack of access to comprehensive physicaland mental health care, including health promotion and disease prevention, has a broad range of social and economic ramifications that lacerate the civicfabric and drive people from shared institutions\u2014subways, buses, parks, schools, and neighborhoods. Even to casual observers, a discussion of the pre- vention and control of crime and the revitalization of communities raises many issues that do not have a single or unambiguous solution because bothcrime and community development are affected byeconomic, health, social, behavioral, political, andscientific factors. Many of these factors are chang-ing at an unprecedented pace, both in the United States and abroad. \"Abroad\" must be emphasized here because economic, health, and social systemshave become increasingly interconnected andglobalized. As competition and trade have increased, people in virtually every country have benefited, and a remarkable degree of mutual interdependence has emerged. These changes have also brought risksthat frequently cannot be adequately addressedThe Context 4 \u00e4 \u00e4immigrating to the United States (867,600) during the previous year.2 As the population grows, it will increasingly become more diverse along manysocioeconomic dimensions. The increasing diver-sity will create challenges and opportunities forboth the public and private sectors. In addition to population size, the age structure will be important in planning for community redevelopment andcrime prevention. Changes in the Age and Racial Makeup of the U.S. Population Today, much attention is being focused on the \"aging\" of the U.S. population. Citizens 65 andolder doubled in number between the 1950s and the 1980s. The fastest growing age group is between 55 and 65\u2014now at 21.5 million but expected toincrease to 30 million by 2000 as baby boomers ap-proach retirement age. 3 This trend raises concerns about the economic and social aspects of care forthe elderly and the ratio of elderly dependents to productive adults, whose caring responsibilities will shift increasingly from children to the elderly. Another trend on the demographic landscape is the growth of the population share of nonwhitecitizens. The minority population numbered nearly70 million in 1996, about one in four Americans. By the middle of the 21st century, however, the size of the minority population should just about equalthat of the non-Hispanic white population. In 1996,African-Americans made up the largest segment ofthe minority population\u201432 million people, about12 percent of all Americans. Hispanics followed closely with 27 million (10 percent). 4 Moreover, because of differential birth rates, a disproportionate fraction of the country's children,adolescents, and young adults will be nonwhite.Think of the economic and social implications ofan aged population mostly white, combined with a youth population mostly minority. New Health Stresses on Women in the Workplace Another demographic trend is the large-scale move- ment of women from the home into the workplace,particularly into jobs that subject them to healthrisks of the kind previously prevalent among men.In addition to traditional industrial hazards and workplace pollution, both men and women nowsuffer the putative side effects of a range of newtechnologies. But our considerations must includethe less overt but long-term impact of job stress onwomen's health along with the psychological and economic burden of single parenthood. Women who work outside the home still do most of the housework as well. Added to the pressures oflong hours of work inside and outside the home arethe time conflicts that emerge when one is both ahomemaker\u2014and usually family caretaker\u2014and a wage earner. Sick children, school holidays, and ill elderly relatives all contribute to stress and frustra-tion in the context of inadequate health and socialservices and employers support for workingwomen. Additional problems include inflexiblework schedules, the trend among employers to \"do more with fewer employees,\" and the lack of high-quality, accessible, and affordable child andelder care. Each of these demographic trends has serious ramifications for social policy, economic planning,and health care reform. For example, the aging of Americans clearly implies a need for increased at- tention to a broad spectrum of geriatric health andsocial services. The age group between 55 and 65 islosing health benefits at a faster rate than any othergroup except children. Many in this age groupcannot qualify for health insurance because of the preexisting health condition criterion imposed by a number of insurance plans. Another segment of thispopulation no longer has health coverage becausewhen they were in early retirement their formeremployers canceled their benefits to reduce costs.Unfortunately, women have a greater chance than men of being uninsured. \"Social Diseases\" and the Growth of EconomicInequality The growth in the nonwhite share of the population is distressingly bound up with the persistence of,and even increases in, certain familiar pathologiesof disenfranchisement\u2014substance abuse, teenagepregnancy, family disintegration\u2014as well as more recent challenges to the health services system,Bailus Walker, Jr. 5\u00e4\u00e4such as that of devising, supporting, and delivering culturally appropriate services to new immigrants(both legal and illegal) and refugees. Within this matrix, there is another subset of prob- lems that might be characterized as new \"social dis-eases.\" By social disease, we mean a mixed bag of pathologies\u2014some physical, some psychological, some both. They range from homelessness amongveterans and others to child abuse (every 11 sec-onds a child is reported abused or neglected), withits long-term neuropsychological impacts fromsubstance dependency to obesity. Some of these are pathologies of poverty due to changes in the distri- bution and location of jobs and in the level of edu-cation and training required to obtain employment. 5 Let me hasten to insert here that there have alwaysbeen homeless people in the United States. As eco-nomic circumstances have fluctuated, so have the size and composition of the homeless population. The homelessness problem has increasingly cap-tured public attention. Take, for example, Washing-ton, D.C. Evidence of the problem is not hard tofind in the Nation's capital. Twenty-five familiesspent the Christmas holidays in an emergency shelter. Many others were housed elsewhere. The population at the shelter has been growing since itopened last November. Similar trends have beenidentified in other cities, according to a telephonesurvey of community leaders conducted in late1997 by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. Of particular relevance to the present discussion is the fact that many homeless individuals, particu-larly single young men, have histories of encounterswith the criminal justice system and a glaring lackof experience with the health care system. Most disheartening are the cases of adolescents and post-adolescents who grow out of foster care orchild mental health and mental retardation facilitiesbecause they are no longer eligible for residentiallybased services for their age group, yet they havenowhere to live. They then resort to illegal means to get food and shelter. Unfortunately, the otherwise robust economy of today has helped create the illusion that everyone isprospering, but that is not the case. Indeed, there isa rapidly widening gap between rich and poor.Although it is tempting to add the influence of the historic legacy of racial segregation and discrimina-tion, that would only be assigning blame\u2014which isnot a productive exercise\u2014and would blur the chal-lenges and opportunities to recognize and addressthe underlying forces that have provoked economic stress for many Americans. In this direction, William Julius Wilson, a long-time student of economic and social problems of urbanAmerica, writes: Many of today's problems in the inner- city neighborhoods\u2014crime, family dissolution, welfare\u2014are fundamen- tally a consequence of the disappear-ance of work. Work is not simply away of making a living and supportingyour family. It also constitutes aframework for daily behavior because it imposes discipline. 6 The Troubling Issue of Mental Health Then there is the deeply troubling issue of mental health, a problem so serious that it must be consid-ered separately. It cuts across boundaries of race,class, and neighborhood. If it differs from group togroup or community to community, it is in com- plexity, not in fundamentals. The relevance of men- tal health to our discussion today was underscoredthree decades ago in a 1967 paper of the AmericanBar Association (ABA). It is worth quoting atlength: If one observes both persons who crowd our criminal courts and the population of our mental hospitals, oneis struck not by differences betweenthe two but by similarities. Our pre-occupation with trying to separate the\"mentally ill\" from the \"criminals\" may have led us to overlook a more central reality; both mental illness andcriminality are tributaries of somedeeper mysterious channels. Certainly,there are differences between \"crimi-nals\" and the \"mentally ill,\" but it seems possible that the problems ofThe Context 6 \u00e4 \u00e4mental illness and crime lend them- selves to identical methods ofhandling. 7 The ABA report goes on to state that there is alimited supply of mental health resources andinefficient use of those that exist. This resource issue has been brought into much sharper focus by a recent study that shows that un-der the pressure of competition and managed care,two-thirds of the Nation's private hospitals that areequipped to take in mentally ill patients dump themon hard-pressed, financially weak public hospitals. The study also reports that hospitals discharge mental patients prematurely, either when theirhealth insurance runs out or when the cost of theircoverage exceeds the reimbursement rate thattheir insurance companies pay hospitals. Amongadolescent psychiatric patients, it is more difficult for those without health insurance than those with insurance to obtain needed behavioral health serv-ices. How many of those who cannot get carebecome \"students\" in the juvenile justice systemis not clear. Added to this is the shortage of mental health care professionals. For example, in 1997, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2014which recognizesareas with a paucity of mental health care serv-ices\u2014designated 536 mental health care profes-sional shortage areas in the United States. This trendcould get worse if the organizational landscape of health care delivery continues to be rearranged (i.e., by mergers, consolidations, and alignments ofhealth care organizations and institutions). 8 Health Care to Meet the Nation's Changing Needs The demographic trend pertaining to women raises basic questions about what health services are mostcritical for female heads-of-household and their children as well as about how, when, in what set- ting, and at what cost such services should beprovided. Each of the other demographic trendspreviously cited expands or lends weight to a groupwith new or greater needs or with needs that haveso far been inadequately addressed in the health andsocial services system. These needs have not been met for a number of reasons. One of the mostprominent reasons is that many members of thegroup lack a regular source of health care with anemphasis on preventive health services. They lackthese services because they do not have health insurance or other means to pay for care. In a recent study by the National Center for Health Statistics,it was found that African-American persons werefour times more likely than whites to report\"no insurance/can't afford\" as their main reasonfor poor health. I will close by underscoring the fact that near the top of any agenda for revitalizing communities andreducing crime must be a health care system thatsuccessfully addresses the issue of equity betweenthe young and aged and among social and ethnicgroups. The health care system must have the capacity, commitment, and community orientation to be an active part of efforts to address health careneeds of adolescents, including behavioral disor-ders and related dysfunctions. It must also addresspast inattention to women's health issues that havecreated serious gaps in knowledge about the cause, treatment, and prevention of disease in women. Unfortunately, the health care system that existstoday in the United States is not fully prepared tomeet these and other challenges of the 21st century,as we are constantly reminded by the media,advocates for the poor and medically underserved, policymakers, and participants in forums and workshops. As managed care has emerged as a principal system for health care and evidence indicates that the profitmargins of health maintenance organizations arefalling and services may be reduced, it is becoming increasingly clear that more health care reform is needed. These organizations are also confrontedwith angry consumers demanding better servicesand hospitals and physicians determined to resistfurther cutbacks in fees. 9 Clearly, health care must be substantially reformed to meet the changing needs of all stakeholders in a system so essential to community revitalization andto a reduction in the incidence of crime and relatedsocial problems.Bailus Walker, Jr. 7\u00e4\u00e4Notes 1. \"More Suburbs Find City Ills Don't Respect City Limits,\" Wall Street Journal , January 2, 1998, B1. 2.

Few criminal justice reforms and innovations directly addresspoverty or the systems charged with addressingpoverty\u2014housing, education, welfare, and employ-ment and training. In the future, the criminal justicesystem must be more proactive in influencing anti- poverty, community revitalization, family, and edu- cational programs and policies. To have a strongervoice in the design of these programs and policies,economic trends need to be monitored and analyzedfrom a crime control and community revitalizationperspective. Three of the general trends that will influence the American economic landscape in the 21st centurywill have a special impact on crime rates and thesuccess of efforts to revitalize distressed communi-ties. These three trends are: lIncreases in populations with higher-than- average risk of participating in crime, including long-term unemployed adults and youths,unemployed ex-offenders, school dropouts,and children reared in fatherless homes. lIncreases in the number of high-poverty commu-nities because of failing schools, unemployment, underemployment, and community abandonment strategies. lThe continued reliance on ineffective programsand policies to promote family self-sufficiencyand revitalize distressed communities, including\"deconcentration of poverty\" approaches and the emphasis on income maintenance rather than on asset-building strategies.Cicero Wilson As we approach the year 2000, the United Statesis nearing the end of a prolonged period of prisonconstruction. The growth of violent crime and sen-tencing reforms in the 1980s and 1990s have led torecord numbers of incarcerated adults and juve-niles. Although crime rates declined in 1995 and 1996, it is not clear what the long-term crime and incarceration trends will be during the next20 years. If crime rates do not continue to decline,local officials may divert government resourcesaway from schools, community development,parks, and other public amenities for prison con- struction. Two important priorities for our Nation are to reduce the rate of crime and to minimizethe impact of crime on children, families, andcommunities. Despite improvements in the criminal justice sys- tem, such as community policing, drug courts, and increases in prison beds for violent offenders, the incidence of crime remains high in the UnitedStates. The focus of our attention in the criminaljustice system is on improvements in how we dealwith crime after it is committed. The criminal jus-tice system must begin to monitor more carefully economic and community trends that influence the rate and depth of poverty. The efforts of policy-makers and practitioners to achieve crime reductiongoals in the next 20 years will require greater atten-tion to the reduction of poverty. Rates of crime maybe influenced more by rates of persistent poverty than by criminal justice interventions. Poverty, not race, sex, or age, still has the highest correlationwith crime and violence. Poverty helps create and maintain the behaviors and attitudes that contribute to crime, violence, and theEconomic Shifts That Will Impact Crime Control and Community Revitalization 10 \u00e4 \u00e4Population Trends Trend One: For Dropouts and Unskilled Workers, Finding FamilyWage Jobs With Benefits WillBecome More Difficult It will be difficult for unskilled and uneducated labor to find family wage work in the 21st century.The globalization of the economy and technologyare producing greater productivity, greater competi-tion, larger profits, and fewer family wage jobs.Although foreign competition and lower overseas wages in some countries have cost the United States jobs, most of our job losses were because of com-petition from high-wage, high-technology countriessuch as Germany and Japan. Technology will havea greater impact than foreign competition on jobloss and disruption of career paths. Technology will not only eliminate some jobs in industries such as banking and manufacturing, it will also change theeducational skills needed for the new jobs. Another major source of labor market problems is the corporate culture that promotes maximizingprofits by downsizing, or converting full-time jobs with benefits into part-time jobs with no benefits. Jeremy Rifkin, in his book The End of Work , 1 predicts technology and corporate culture will determine unemployment levels in the 21st century.If unemployment grows to levels of 20-25 percentnationally as Rifkin and other authors predict, then the pressure on all of our social systems will be enormous. While such dire predictions are far fromguaranteed, these trends must be carefully moni-tored by agencies and advocates concerned aboutreducing crime and revitalizing economically andsocially distressed communities. Trend Two: The Number of Youths Failing School Will Continue toEscalate Without Changes in SchoolPolicies, Tutorial Support Systems,and Parental Involvement Youth crime prevention is often deemed synony- mous with school failure prevention. Unfortunately,school failure is a growing trend in poor urban andrural areas. Two sources of school failure areextremely important to criminal justice and com- munity development advocates: unaddressed learn-ing difficulties and school suspension and expulsionpolicies. Unaddressed learning difficulties. Students who fall behind two grades in school are more likely to drop out or become involved with drugs, alcohol, or the courts. Despite the emphasis on educationstandards, our schools are still struggling to helpstudents master basic reading, math, and communi-cations skills. Many students who are experiencinglearning difficulties have nowhere to go for help. Working parents, especially single working parents, have limited time to check homework or tutor theirchildren. Teachers are overburdened. Most churchesdo not offer latchkey or tutorial programs. Theabsence of adequate rural transportation is a majorimpediment to getting students to programs, if pro- grams exist. Without tutorial assistance for students in schools and juvenile institutions to supplement classroominstruction, many students will continue to fail andeither drop out or graduate functionally illiterate.These youths lack the skills needed to succeed in the 21st-century working world and are at high risk of becoming involved in criminal activities to sup-port themselves. School expulsion and suspension policies. In response to student disruptive behavior, violence,weapons, and illegal substances, most schools have adopted zero-tolerance rules to quickly expel offending students. Schools penalize minor misbe-havior with suspensions. However, unlike suspen-sions of two decades ago, some schools have addedprocedures to automatically fail students in coursesin which they have five unexcused absences. A stu- dent who is suspended for 5 days fails all of his/her classes for the entire semester. Old policies wouldrequire students to attend afterschool detention anddo more work and suspended students to make upall assigned work. Today, schools expel studentswithout adequate provision for alternative schools. Schools also suspend students so frequently that they fail enough classes to fall more than 1 yearbehind their graduating classes. These studentsusually drop out of school. These policies removethe most troublesome students, but they also pushCicero Wilson 11\u00e4\u00e4out students who could be helped. These policies are at odds with everything we know about schoolabsence, dropouts, school failure, and delinquency.These school policies are filling communities withteenagers who are unsupervised most of the day.These out-of-school youths are at high risk for sub- stance abuse, teen pregnancy, and criminal activity. Whatever the sources of school failure, more than 1,100 youths drop out of school every day in theUnited States. Many students will graduate withoutthe basic skills needed to succeed in the rapidlychanging working world. Unabated, this school failure trend intensifies the problems of unemploy- ment and poverty, which are primary contributorsto crime rates. Trend Three: The High Incarceration Rates of the 1990s Will Result in aFlood of Unemployed ReleaseesFrom Prisons and Jails in the NextTwo Decades The efforts of economic and community develop- ment programs, work force development projects,and welfare reformers erode when adult and juve- nile parolees return to the community unemployed. They attempt to make money through street crime,drug sales, and extortion from women on welfare.The current lack of sufficient reintegration pro-grams, high recidivism rates, and the number ofpersons to be released from jails and prisons during the next 25 years should alarm everyone. Further- more, large numbers of these releasees are return-ing to the communities we are trying to revitalize. The criminal activities of unrepentant parolees make the neighborhoods inhospitable to efforts torevitalize the family, community, and local eco- nomy. Crimes such as carjacking, school violence, and random shootings have fueled the move ofmany families and businesses to communities per-ceived as safe. Business tax incentives, businessretention strategies, and community developmentefforts such as Empowerment Zones are severely diminished as development tools when businesses and residents perceive a community or city as crimeridden. Controlling community crime and violenceis an important prerequisite to communityrevitalization.Trend Four: There is an Increase in the Number of Fatherless Children,Who Are More Prone to Delinquencyand Other Social Pathologies As the incidence of father absence grows, commu- nity disintegration and crime, especially youthcrime, will continue to grow. Between 1960 and1990, the percentage of children living apart fromtheir biological fathers increased from 17 to 36 per-cent. By the year 2000, half of the Nation's children may not have their fathers at home. While the he- roic efforts of single women to raise their childrenalone are laudable, the economic and social require-ments for raising healthy and productive childrenare hard to achieve by poor single parents alone.Reengaging fathers in the economic and social life of their children is an important but overlooked aspect of addressing poverty, community revitaliza-tion, and crime. Many of our problems in crime control and com- munity revitalization are strongly related to fatherabsence. For example: lSixty-three percent of youth suicides are fromfatherless homes. lNinety percent of all homeless and runawayyouths are from fatherless homes. lEighty-five percent of children who exhibitbehavioral disorders are from fatherless homes. lSeventy-one percent of high school dropouts arefrom fatherless homes. lSeventy percent of youths in State institutionsare from fatherless homes. lSeventy-five percent of adolescent patients insubstance abuse centers are from fatherless homes. lEighty-five percent of rapists motivated by displaced anger are from fatherless homes. Without fathers as social and economic role mod- els, many boys try to establish their manhoodthrough sexually predatory behavior, aggressive- ness, or violence. These behaviors interfere withEconomic Shifts That Will Impact Crime Control and Community Revitalization 12 \u00e4 \u00e4schooling, the development of work experience, and self-discipline. Many poor children who liveapart from their fathers are prone to becoming courtinvolved. Once these children become court in-volved, their records of arrest and conviction oftenblock access to employment and training opportuni- ties. Criminal histories often lock these young per- sons into the underground or illegal economies. Behaviors related to father absence that directly contribute to the growth of welfare and the difficul-ties in creating jobs in communities include: lSexually predatory behavior that results in out- of-wedlock births. (Most teen mothers are impregnated by older men, not teen boys.) lDomestic violence that occurs as a result ofarguments over enforcement of child supportpayments. lWelfare pimping, which is the practice of men collecting part of the welfare check from girl- friends or the mothers of their out-of-wedlockchildren. Some pimps collect from five or sixmothers on welfare per month. Innovative father engagement programs have had an impact on child rearing, family economic stabil- ity, and gang involvement. Unless community revi- talization and crime reduction programs begin toaddress the need for father engagement programsand services, the cycle of poverty and crime couldcontinue virtually unabated. Community Revitalization Trends Trend Five: There is an Increase in the Number of High-Poverty Areas Socially and economically distressed communities tend to promote behaviors and attitudes conducive to crime and dependency. High levels of crime alsohelp to maintain and increase high-poverty commu-nities. The 1990 census indicated that the numberof high-poverty census tracts had increased sincethe 1980 census. The proportion of poor persons living in extreme poverty census tracts in the 100 largest U.S. cities tripled between 1970 and1990, from 12.6 percent to 36.2 percent. 2Apparently, approaches to law enforcement and in-come maintenance in extremely poor communitieshad limited impact on poverty and crime during thelast two decades. Although current welfare reformand broken windows approaches to law enforce-ment appear to have some impact, the underlying poverty and propensity for crime have been sup- pressed, not reduced. If recessionary economicconditions reappear with high levels of unemploy-ment, the rates of poverty and crime could rise sig-nificantly. Federal programs and policies that havean impact on employment and education in poor communities are very important components of an effective crime reduction and community revitaliza-tion strategy. Federal criminal justice and antipoverty policies need to consider more effective resource targetingto reduce the number of high-poverty communities. However, these policies and programs to combat the concentration of poverty should not rely on\"deconcentration\" or \"dilution\" approaches. Thesedilution approaches deconcentrate poverty by mov-ing poor families into mixed-income communities.Generally, these programs do not help families im- prove their family income, gain economic literacy, or reduce or eliminate such problems as drug addic-tion before moving the family. Dilution programsshould not be \"problem export\" programs. Simplymoving to a better neighborhood will not automati-cally change destructive attitudes and behaviors. Trend Six: Community Abandonment Frustrated criminal justice, housing, and economicdevelopment officials often view communities withvery high rates of crime, housing abandonment,substance abuse, and gangs as beyond help. Invest-ing police and economic development resourcesin these communities is deemed a waste of limited resources. This approach is called a \"community abandonment\" strategy. The problems with thisapproach are numerous. First, these communitiesoften spread their misery to neighboring communi-ties. Second, crime and barriers to economic devel-opment extend far beyond the particular abandoned community. The presence of such a community adversely affects the reputation of entire segmentsof towns and cities. Third, these abandoned com-munities also serve as safe havens for criminalsCicero Wilson 13\u00e4\u00e4who prey on other communities. Fourth, most of what we have learned about successful communityrevitalization has been learned from the efforts oflocal residents and their partners in distressed com-munities. The transformation of the KenilworthParkside Public Housing Development in Washington, D.C., is one of many successful transformations. The frustration and failure associated with revital- ization efforts in very distressed areas is the resultof weak strategies that do not engage the supportof local residents. These strategies also fail to focus on asset building and lack strong criminal justice responses to crime. An example of a good strategyis the Weed and Seed program. The Weed and Seedprogram has a major positive impact on economicdevelopment and revitalization when a coalition ofcommunity and law enforcement agencies work together to eliminate local crack houses. This strong law enforcement response, with media cov-erage of local residents cheering, boosts communitydevelopment efforts. This program says to the pub-lic that something can be done about crime and thatresidents of poor neighborhoods want crime elimi- nated. Without such efforts, community abandon- ment is viewed as a logical response. Trend Seven: Without Policies to Correct Asset Deficiencies, anIncreasing Percentage of FamiliesWill Not Achieve Self-Sufficiencyand Efforts to Revitalize PoorCommunities Will Continue toHave Limited Success Until recently, our approaches to poverty and com- munity development have been focused on deficits,problems, and income security programs. Programsthat do not focus on teaching and asset building consistently fail to reduce poverty and revitalize distressed communities on a large scale. Assetbuilding has been the primary vehicle for liftingindividuals and families out of poverty. Assets suchas savings, homeownership, property ownership,business ownership, and postsecondary education and training are the resources most Americans use to become self-sufficient and decrease the likeli-hood of poverty for themselves and their children.Asset-building programs increase family income rather than supplement inadequate income and alsocreate local jobs and local stakeholders in commu-nities. Poor families that rise out of poverty througheducation and employment often leave poor com-munities because of crime, poor schools for their children, and lack of business ownership and home- ownership opportunities. When these successfulfamilies leave, they take their disposable income,civic involvement, and examples of positive achie-vements with them, leaving the familiar concentra-tion of poor families and problems behind. Asset-building programs also create a positive eco- nomic future for youths. Many youths join gangs orengage in street crime because they feel they haveno other economic options. Programs that provideyouth enterprise skills or education trust fundsinfluence their view of themselves and their risk- taking behavior. Crime prevention and treatment programs as well as community revitalization strat-egies need to include asset building to be effective.Poor and working poor families and individualscan effectively build assets when provided withspecialized programs to help them. By increasing the availability of these programs and promoting asset building for the poor, families and communi-ties can be strengthened. Policymakers and practi-tioners should explore the expanded use of thefollowing programs and policies in reducingpoverty and crime: Economic literacy programs. Economic literacy programs provide basic budgeting and banking andsavings skills for low- and moderate-income indi-viduals and families. Microenterprise and youth enterprise programs. Microenterprise and youth enterprise programs provide entrepreneurial training for low-income individuals. After assessing their talents and inter-ests, each trainee is taught how to develop a realbusiness plan by program staff. The program thenmakes small amounts of capital available to thetrainees to launch their businesses. Homeownership programs for low-income fami- lies. Homeownership programs provide counseling on the homeownership process and assistance withbudgeting, savings, and the downpayment. Theseservices create community stakeholders.Economic Shifts That Will Impact Crime Control and Community Revitalization 14 \u00e4 \u00e4Individual Development Accounts. Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) are restricted sav-ings accounts that can be used for buying a home,starting or expanding a business, or postsecondaryeducation and training. Individuals or families arerequired to save for their dream, and their savings are matched by the private, nonprofit, and public sectors. For example, a family saves $20 a month,and those savings leverage $80 in matching contri-butions. IDAs are included in the new welfare law.The law also allows recipients of income main-tenance benefits to have these accounts without affecting their eligibility to receive benefits. Legis- lation is pending in Congress to provide $100 mil-lion for IDA demonstrations. Conclusions and Recommendations Our real crime reduction and community revitaliza- tion challenges involve finding ways to reducepoverty, the number of high-poverty communities, family disintegration, and the number of young people entering criminal careers. Community devel-opment and crime reduction agencies must not sitby while employment, welfare, child support, andschool agencies institute rules and guidelines thatincrease the difficulty of controlling crime and reversing community decline. For example: lLocal employment agencies have always put ex-offenders and youths at the bottom of prioritylists for employment and training services. Thewillingness of noncustodial fathers to supporttheir children is not considered when selecting participants for training programs. The impor- tance of employment for noncustodial fathers,especially ex-offenders, will not become a prior-ity without Federal guidance. lNew child support and paternity establishmentrules have great potential to increase violence against women and children. State and local agencies need guidance in considering how toreduce these risks.lSchools not only institute expulsion and suspen-sion policies that push too many children out,they also are initially inept at addressing theemergence of gangs in schools. Information onbest practices to prevent and control gangs andviolence in schools is available at the Federal level, but few school administrators use it. Fed- eral incentives to get schools to use this informa-tion are needed. The U.S. Department of Justice has developed accessible databases on best practices in violenceprevention, gang control, victim assistance proce- dures, and other important areas. In addition, the Department of Justice has funded demonstrationsand evaluations of important innovations such asdrug courts, community policing, Weed and Seed,and prison industries. These programs are havingan important impact at the community level. Greater attention should be given to these databases and to innovations by other Federal, State, and localagencies. Federal agencies with mandates to reduce crime and rebuild communities need to focus more atten-tion on asset building, reshaping school suspension policies, and designing programs and policies to engage fathers as positive economic and socialagents in families. Without these changes in ourapproaches, poverty, employment, school failure,and family trends will block efforts to reduce crimeand revitalize communities. Notes 1.

They were carrying valuable property\u2014drugs or the proceeds from the sale ofthose drugs\u2014and so they had to take steps to pro-tect themselves from robbery. Because they weredealing in an illegal market, they could not callthe police if someone tried to steal their valuables. Their self-protection involved carrying handguns. Because young men are tightly networked andhighly imitative, their colleagues\u2014even those notinvolved in selling drugs\u2014armed themselves also,at least in part as a matter of self-protection againstthose who were armed. That led to an arms race in many inner-city neighborhoods. It is widely recognized that violence has always been part of teenage males' dispute-resolutionrepertoire, but that has typically involved fights,the consequences of which were usually no moreserious than a bloody nose. The lethality of the ubiquitous guns contributed in a major way to the doubling of the homicide rate by (and of) those 18and under. The emphasis on the presence of guns as a critical instrument in this process is reflected in the factthat gun suicide rates by young people, especially young African-Americans, escalated at the same time as homicide rates. 2 There were no comparable trends in nongun homicides or suicides. At the same time, the homicide rate for older ages diminished. For those 30 and older, the reductionwas about 20-25 percent. The growth in the prison population during that time (a doubling in the incar- ceration rate between 1985 and 1996) has undoubt-edly contributed to that reduction, although no onehas isolated that incapacitation effect from otherfactors (e.g., a general decline in intimate partnerhomicides) that may have contributed to the decline in the homicide rate by older offenders.The late 1980s saw a dramatic growth in U.S. homicide rates, particularly in homicides commit- ted by young people. Between 1985 and 1992, the homicide arrest rate for youths and children age 18and under more than doubled. This gave rise to con-siderable rhetoric about the \"bloodbath\" that wascoming and the new generation of \"superpredators\"who had to be dealt with in harsh new ways. Fortu- nately, that growth peaked in the early 1990s and has declined appreciably since then. Aggregatehomicide rates are now lower than they have beenfor more than 25 years, but the rate of homicides byyoung people is still well above the stable rates thatprevailed from 1970 through 1985. In this paper, I would like to address some of the contextual issues behind the growth in violence ofthe late 1980s, examine the decline since 1991, andexplore some of the speculations about the factorsthat contributed to that decline. I will then followwith some suggestions for potential Federal roles in helping to decrease crime and revitalize commu- nities. Growth in Violence in the Late 1980s In a recent paper,1 I examined the time trends in three measures\u2014youth homicides, handgun homi-cides by youths, and arrests of nonwhite juvenilesfor drug offenses. Each of these rose dramatically beginning in about 1985 and had more than doubled by 1992. Similar changes were not dis-played in adult homicides, nongun homicides, andarrests of white juveniles for drug offenses. My hypothesized link among these three trends is that crack arrived in the mid-1980s, initially in the larger cities, and spread from there to the smaller cities. Because crack required many more sellersto meet the increased demand (composed of manyThe Context of Recent Changes in Crime Rates 16 \u00e4 \u00e4Shifts During the 1990s The number of homicides by young people leveled off in the early 1990s and did not begin a signifi-cant decline until 1994. With the growth in thehomicide rate among young people stopped, thecontinuing decline in the homicide rate by olderoffenders resulted in a peak national homicide rate in 1991 and a subsequent decline. That decline was dominated by the changes in the largest cities\u2014New York in particular\u2014which displayed verysharp declines, beginning in 1994. One explanation that has been offered for the decline in crime rates is \"demographic change.\" This probably harks back to the last time we saw a significant decline in crime rates, in the early1980s, when demographic change\u2014the aging ofthe baby-boom generation out of the high-crimeages of the late teens and early 20s\u2014was indeed amajor contributor to the crime rate decline. 3 Today, however, demographic change is working in the other direction\u2014to increase crime rates. As canbe seen in exhibit 1, which shows the number ofpeople at each age in the United States in 1998, the smallest age cohort in the Nation under age 40 isnow about 23. These are the people who were bornin 1975 following the baby boom, which peaked inabout 1960. Thus, we are seeing a growing number of individu- als entering the high-crime ages of the late teens and early 20s, and that will continue for at least thenext 10 years. But we should also note that thosechanges are not dramatic, with the cohort sizesexpected to grow by about 15 percent in 15 years,or roughly 1 percent per year. Even when one parti- tions this analysis by race (see exhibit 2, which shows the white and black male populations sepa-rately by age), we see that the young black malepopulation (which is multiplied by a factor of sevento show the comparative growth, since the U.S.white population is about seven times the black population) follows a pattern very similar to the white male population, but with a somewhat fasterrate of growth. Nevertheless, the growth rate of theblack male population is only about 30 percent in15 years, or about 2 percent per year. Exhibit 1.

If crimerates within each demographic group stay constant,then an increase in the size of the demographicgroups with the highest rates contributes to an in-crease in the aggregate crime rate. But other factors are contributing to changes in demographic-specific crime rates well in excess of even 2 percent peryear. During the late 1980s, for example, homiciderates by young people were growing by 10-20 per-cent per year. Declines in recent years, especially inthe largest cities, have also been of that magnitude. An important avenue to pursue is finding an explanation for the recent decline in homicides byyoung people. Possible explanations include: lChanges in the nature of drug markets (crackmarkets in particular), induced by changes inthe nature of the demand, that has led to less violence associated with those markets. lVigorous police and community efforts in at least some cities to get guns out of the hands ofyoung people.lPolice and community efforts to resolve gangconflicts and encourage disarmament. lImprovement in the economy that not only hasprovided jobs to young people but also has beena source of improved hope for succeeding in thelegitimate economy. lIncreased incarceration of potentially violentoffenders. lImprovement in the largest cities that may bemasking a situation that could be very differentin many smaller cities. These explanations certainly are not mutually ex- clusive, and different explanations could apply to different cities. We still need more effort to sort outthese and possibly other contributors to the decline. Even though the decline in the homicide rate by young people is encouraging news, it is importantto note that the homicide rate by juveniles is still at least 60-80 percent above the rate that had pre- vailed for the 15 years from 1970 to 1985. Thus, Exhibit 2. Age of U.S. Males by Race, 1997 Number of Males of Each Race at Each Age(Millions) Source: U.S. Bureau of the CensusAgeWhiteBlack x 7The Context of Recent Changes in Crime Rates 18 \u00e4 \u00e4we still have a long way to go in bringing that rate down. Incarceration has been the Nation's dominant strat- egy against crime over the past 25 years. That hasled to an incarceration rate (prisoners per capita)that is more than four times the rate that prevailed with remarkable stability for the previous 50 years. Incarceration with reasonable sentences is likely tohave an important incapacitation effect on older of-fenders (ages 25 and older), whose lengthy criminalcareers may reasonably predict future offending. Such predictions are far more difficult with younger offenders, so it is important to address opportunities for investment in crime-prevention efforts targetingindividuals in high-risk situations at an early age.Even though the payoff from such investments willtake several years to be realized, it is likely to ex-ceed the fiscal cost\u2014let alone the social cost to the society and the economy\u2014of widespread use of long-term incarceration of young people. But noone can make that assessment definitively becausethe evidence on the comparative payoffs is stillpoorly known and the payoffs will vary with differ-ent kinds of interventions with different target groups. A major national challenge lies in finding what approaches can be most effective with each ofthe different kinds of young offenders. We still donot have definitive solutions, but it is extremelyimportant to invest in the research that will enableus to develop and identify them. Windows on the Future As we look to the future, there is little we can saywith certainty. One strong predictor is the demo-graphic composition of the Nation. It has alreadybeen indicated that demographic trends will con-tribute to making matters worse, but only at the rateof about 1-2 percent per year. The other matter of concern is the greater number of people who will be unemployed or without reliable sources of incomeif the economy turns down\u2014a likely eventuality\u2014but few people can say with any confidence justwhen that will occur. When that happens, we mightsee more people resorting to criminal activity to offset their displacement from the legitimate economy. One group in particular for whom that isan important issue is the people who will be dis-placed from welfare support when their time ofeligibility expires. So far, we have seen an impor- tant reduction in the welfare rolls by those best ableto move into the legitimate economy, while thosewithout such opportunities have stayed on welfare.Within the next few years, more of that latter groupwill find themselves without welfare support, and\u2014 especially if there is concurrently a significant growth in unemployment\u2014there is a serious riskthat they will pursue illegitimate means for theirsustenance. Another important cloud on the horizon is the con- cern about the arrival of new drug epidemics in our major cities. We have seen an ebbing of serious drug abuse in recent years as young people haveeschewed the crack cocaine that so often did seri-ous damage to the lives of their parents and sib-lings. As that awareness fades in coming cohorts ofyoung people, or if new drugs without the compa- rable stigma arrive, we might well see a reignition of some of the serious crime epidemics that charac-terized the late 1980s. The data to be collected in75 cities by NIJ's Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring(ADAM) program, involving urinalysis of bookedarrestees, should provide some early warning of the arrival of those problems. The Federal Role As one builds on this background to identify an appropriate Federal role for dealing with theseproblems, one is first faced with the complexity ofthe division of labor between the Federal Govern-ment and State and local governments. It is widely accepted that the primary operational responsibility for local crime control is inherently State and local.But there are important aspects of the crime prob-lem for which the primary responsibility is Federal. One relates to interdiction of criminal activity in which interstate transactions are particularly impor- tant. The most evident of these is the area in which there is already widespread Federal involvement\u2014interstate trafficking in drugs. But it is also impor-tant to focus on another crime-related product,which is much more directly associated withviolence and one in which the Federal role is still poorly developed. That relates to the illegal traffick- ing in firearms, particularly the semiautomatichandguns that have been implicated as a majorfactor in the rise of juvenile violence over the pastAlfred Blumstein 19\u00e4\u00e4decade. Crime-gun tracing by the Bureau of Alco- hol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) through its Na-tional Gun Tracing Center has seen some importantgrowth over the past several years, but the capabil-ity and the effort applied are still far less than isneeded to become effective in interdicting that illicit traffic. Better collaboration between local police and ATF could result in more effectiveinterdiction of that traffic. The other general role of the Federal Government relates to \"public goods\" that States or localitiesneed but whose creation is expensive and is broadly beneficial, so the Federal Government appropriately becomes the agent to serve the combined interestsof States and localities. These public goods includecreation and maintenance of shared operationaldatabases such as the National Crime InformationCenter (NCIC); fostering and evaluating a wide range of innovations and disseminating the results of evaluations of those innovations so that thesuccessful ones can be replicated elsewhere; andorganizing and sponsoring research and statisticalprojects and disseminating the information and newinsights they generate. This last\u2014the research and statistics function\u2014is the critical one, and it is not likely to occur without major Federal involvement.These activities are the province of the U.S. Depart-ment of Justice's Office of Justice Programs\u2014NIJ,the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the Office of Juvenile Justiceand Delinquency Prevention, and the Office forVictims of Crime. Most people see these functions as merely a trans- fer of Federal money to alleviate local costs. The agencies' participation in providing the knowledge to enhance the overall effectiveness of the agenciesof the criminal justice system is a far more criticalFederal role because the functions could not beperformed without that participation. In view oftheir importance, it is astonishing how little money the Federal Government invests in those functions. Notes 1.

The best families and schools cando\u2014and this is crucial for our understanding ofcrime and how to deal with it\u2014is to develop aconscience that serves as a counterweight. Human nature is condemned to an eternal struggle between theses urges (which make us offend mores andoften laws) and our conscience. Most important, how law-abiding (and good) we are as adults is very much determined by the extentto which the conscience we acquired as children receives external reinforcement. This is particularly effective when it comes from those in whom wehave an emotional investment: members of ourcommunities. The stronger the communal bondsand the more they support pro-social behaviour, themore we are able to curb our urges, and the lower the level of crime. This is why we are all so sur- prised at crime in a small, tight-knit community,such as Dunblane. The crimes I am talking about include not merely street violence, but also child and spousal abuse,white-collar crimes (embezzlement), corporate crime and political corruption. Crime occurs in all social classes, not only in inner cities. While communities can curb even the mostserious violent crimes, they are particularly effec-tive in minimising most other crimes, releasingresources to fight the hard core. Tony Blair's anti-crime programme, as drafted be- fore his election, was successful in deflecting Toryaccusations that Labour was soft on crime. Its focuson moving police from behind desks to the streets,\"zero tolerance\" for petty crimes, and fast-trackpunishment for persistent youth offenders, leaves plenty of room to make it more communitarian. The government programme could now take intoThe way one thinks about and deals with crime depends on one's assumptions about human nature.If one assumes that people are good by nature, asmany liberals do, then one blames conditions insociety on ill conduct. Giving people jobs\u2014well-paying jobs and not dead-end ones\u2014is the most obvious treatment for anti-social behaviour. Educa- tion, rehabilitation, and psychotherapy are closeseconds. But if one shares the assumption of social conserva- tives (from the religious right to Michael Howard)that people have strong aggressive and sexual im- pulses, then one seeks ever stronger measures of law and order. In the US, Steve Forbes campaignedin favour of one strike and you're out. Yet there is a mountain of social-science evidence to supporta third, communitarian position; infants are bornwithout values (there are no altruistic genes) but, given the proper moral infrastructure, they can acquire values. The building blocks of such an infrastructure are well known. Historically they have included fami-lies, schools, and communities (which encompassplaces of worship and voluntary associations). From this viewpoint, the sharp rise in crime in western societies is due to the weakening of allthese moral elements. The family has clearlydeclined, and no new social agency has taken itsplace. Whatever one thinks about child-care cen-tres, their focus is on custodial care, perhaps learn- ing, but hardly on moral education. Schools in Britain still do a fair job of character-building, butas pluralism rises they are under increasing pressureto be value-neutral. The sad fact is that even when families and schools are functioning to perfection as values-transmitters, as the moral agents of society they do not suffice. This takes us back to the pesky question of humannature. It is impossible to expunge all anti-social *This article is reprinted with permission from The Guardian , London, England. It appeared in The Guardian on Saturday, June 28, 1997.Community Watch 22 \u00e4 \u00e4account that crime is best prevented from the begin- ning rather than deterred by punishment after thefact. And that if one simply arrests most kinds ofcriminals (for instance, drug dealers), other peoplesoon take their place. Both issues are best addressedwhen members of communities censure anti-social behaviour. To mobilise communities to censure crime strongly, they must be treated as true partners with thepolice. Community policing does not quite cut it.While it is helpful to move more police on to thebeat, it is also necessary to change the demographic composition of local police forces so they will not differ too much from the communities they are sup-posed to co-operate with. Community leaders mustbe involved in setting police priorities. Should thepolice concentrate on drug-dealers or on schoolsafety? Should they focus on outsiders or entrap kerb-crawlers? Some communities cannot be reached because they are hostile in general and to the police in particular.Yet in some instances, for example in Los Angeles,even gangs have been won over to help curb vio-lence. Many disadvantaged communities already realise that they bear the brunt of crime. If they could be convinced that the police would deal fairlywith them, they would be more likely to collabo-rate. Recently we learned that the curbing of qual-ity-of-life offences\u2014minor crimes such as playingcassette players loudly in public places, graffiti, and aggressive begging\u2014is surprisingly effective in reducing more serious offences. Such drivesre-establish community mores and mobilise thecommunity to back crime-fighting. Stigma is a useful device for addressing criminal behaviour; unfortunately it ruffles the feathers of liberals. They speak of returning to putting people in stocks. But while most everyone would agreethat it would be a better world if one could preventcrime only by positive incentives, realistically,negative sanctions are unavoidable. Stigma is theleast costly and the most\u2014yes, the most\u2014humane. A young accountant is caught for the second time having embezzled money from a pension fund.Send him to jail, and he is most likely to graduatewith even less respect for the law, be subject topunitive conditions, and carry the stigma of a crimi-nal conviction, all at a high public cost. Make him carry a sign in his neighborhood (as a judge re-cently did in the US) and he will be deterred fromrepeating his offence\u2014at minimal public cost. Another way for communities to prevent crime is for them to wall themselves in\u2014troubling, because communities sometimes employ these gates to keep out those of a different class or race. One notes thataffluent communities and public institutions alreadyhave stringent entry controls. I cannot get intoParliament, the BBC, the High Court, and well-offpeople's residences, without identifying myself and explaining my business. Working-class neighbourhoods should be allowed the sameprotection, given that they are the likely victims ofviolent crime and that the state has not succeeded inkeeping crime at bay. Gates and other methods ofshielding target areas have proven surprisingly effective. Gates have another constructive effect. They can help build community. When a neighbourhoodin Dayton, Ohio, was flooded with drug-relatedcrimes, gates\u2014only to cars, not to pedestrians\u2014blocked the traffic from the highway and divided the neighbourhood into six cul-de-sacs. Each of the six areas developed its own identity and social web.Children were heard to comment on the way toschool that they must behave themselves becausethrowing stones or yelling aloud was not welcomein these parts. The undesirable effects of gated communities can be avoided by ensuring that neighbourhoods treat all who seek entry in thesame manner. One still would prefer open commu-nities, but gates seem necessary until crime, includ-ing terrorism, is better controlled. Some pundits insist that the real issue is the exag- gerated fear of crime, rather than crime itself. Fear is more pervasive in communities where crime ratesare relatively lower. (A recent survey\u2014which relieson self-reporting\u2014found that in England morepeople reported themselves to have been a victim ofcrime last year than in the US, although crime rates in the US are several times higher.) This fear has barely declined even as crime has been reduced. Many liberals draw from this the somewhat pre- sumptuous conclusion that the members of suchcommunities are irrational (the term \"hysterical\" isAmitai Etzioni 23\u00e4\u00e4sometimes used) and need reassurance, rather than more protection. But communities are sensible toworry about crime, even if after rising drastically(by more than five times between 1960 and 1990 inEngland and Wales) crime rates have now levelledoff or been curtailed. Crime has such devastating and lasting effects that limited changes in statistics do not much matter.Parents who yearn for a day when their childrenwill be able to play outside unsupervised derivelittle comfort from a fall in crime of 11 percent.People won't walk at night in the \"wrong\" parts of a town simply because the murder rate is not as high as it used to be. Among the more innovative ideas is an approach highlighted during the first Talk to Tony town meet-ing: restorative justice. It calls for offenders to meettheir victims in the presence of other community members. The offenders are expected to apologise as well as perform community service that will helpcompensate the victim\u2014for instance, restoring theirvandalised property. The community determines thenature and scope of the compensatory service. Untested so far is an idea from the Communitarian Network, which advocates sharing with communi- ties savings that result from falling crime. The plan,\"it takes a village to prevent a crime\", offers com-munities a deal: it gives the community an estimateof the public cost caused by crimes committed onits turf. If the community agrees to fight crime, and if as a result crime falls in the following year, the community is awarded half the savings. These canbe used for shared purposes, from building a play- ground to a swimming pool, but not for projects forthe benefit of individuals. This further enhances thecommunal bonds, which in turn enables the com-munity to combat crime. These measures are not meant to supplant the con- servatives' law-and-order measures or the liberals' job-creation. Communities are partners which canshoulder an important part of maintaining publicsafety, but they can hardly combat it single-handedly. One should note that for many crime-fighting purposes, police are over-skilled and expensive. It is best to draw as much as possible on alternative sources, and sentence first offendersto community work rather than jail. When it comes to policing, a certainty of punish- ment is more effective than extensive punishment,and communities would be better off if the numbers of cops and courts were increased, rather than the number of jail cells. Jails should accommodatemore people, for shorter sentences, to better effect.Providing the right jobs can significantly reducecrime; unfortunately such jobs are difficult for gov-ernments to produce, especially for the areas in which violent crime is most common. Yet law-and - order and socio-economic cures have long been thefocus of the debate over the best ways to deal withcrime. These have overshadowed the importanceof community as a reinforcer of pro-social mores.Whatever portion of crime community-based meth- ods can prevent, they eliminate it in ways that are low in cost and humane.Panel Two: The Roles of Federal, State, and Local Governments and Communities in Revitalizing Neighborhoods and in Addressing Local Public Safety Problems27\u00e4\u00e4To reduce crime and revitalize communities, it is necessary to develop a strategy that can effectively intervene in the cycle of violence before it claims the next generation. A primary focus of our efforts,therefore, should be to reach and guide our Nation'syouths who now, by the age of 18, confront morecrucial moral decisions than their parents' genera-tion faced in an entire lifetime. A model of effective youth intervention does exist. There are hundreds of men and women throughoutthe country who have the proven capacity to pro-vide the guidance and example that have the powerto redirect at-risk youths to productive and positiveactivities. The importance and unique power of these dedicated community leaders can be appreci- ated best in light of the scope of the problems e xpe- rienced by today's youths and the dismal track recordof many conventional, professionally designedprograms for at-risk youths. 1 A Generation in Jeopardy Throughout the Nation, crimes committed by juveniles, who often express a haunting sense of indifference, have created a public perception thata portion of the upcoming generation is alreadylost\u2014beyond help. Reports and statistical analysesalso reveal that the epidemic of spiritual malaiseand violence is not an isolated \"inner-city\" problem and that it is affecting families of every income level. Throughout the Nation, youths from suburbanneighborhoods and rural communities, like inner-city youths, are wasting, losing, and taking theirlives. Five thousand children die each year as aresult of assaults, illness, or suicide. 2 It is projected that 1 in 7 youths who are now between the ages of 10 and 18 will run away from home. Each year,1.5 million young people are living on the streets. 3 Many of these children turn to the drug trade orprostitution as a source of money.Trends in behavioral choices among adolescents indicate that the crisis will grow worse if effective intervention and support are not provided. In a recent survey of eighth graders, one-third of the re-spondents said they use illicit drugs and 15 percentsaid they had drunk more than five alcoholic bever-ages in a row in the preceding 2 weeks. 4 In 1996, the greatest increase in birth to adolescents was to girls younger than 15 years old. The firearms homi- cide rate among 10- through 14-year-olds morethan doubled between 1985 and 1992, and suiciderates for these youths increased by 120 percentfrom 1980 to 1992. 5 Clearly, our Nation's conventional responses to the problems of youth violence have not been effective in spite of the millions of dollars that have beeninvested in them. Researchers project that juvenilearrests for violent crime will more than double by2010. A recent nationwide survey reported that gangmembership in the United States has grown to more than 650,000 youths who are involved in 25,000 gangs. In response, a massive crackdown waslaunched by the FBI, which created 133 task forcesthat resulted in 92,000 arrests and 35,000 convic-tions nationwide throughout a 4-year period. 6 Yet in many cases, these arrests did no more than move a \"bubble\" of crime to a new location. In the words of one corrections officer in a State where half of a38,000-person prison population has been identifiedas gang members, \"The problem does not go away.When the community gets rid of its gang problem,that problem is then transferred to the correctional institution. In fact, it becomes more intensified.\" 7 To date, most resources and efforts to rescue our Nation's children have been targeted to inner-citypopulations. Young people in low-income neighbor-hoods have felt the most severe impact of the moralfree-fall that is afflicting the next generation be- cause their communities lack the economic stabilityRevitalizing Communities and Reducing Crime Robert L. Woodson, Sr.Revitalizing Communities and Reducing Crime 28 \u00e4 \u00e4that has provided a temporary buffer for middle- and upper-income youths. Yet, although millions ofdollars have been invested in programs for inner-city at-risk youths, many of these projects have hadlittle impact on the crisis. Consider, for example, the case of a teenager in Washington, D.C., who murdered a taxi driver. The youth was sent to a psychiatric treatment center in aresort town in upstate New York where he received$100,000-a-year therapy. After several months oftherapy, he simply walked away from the facility,returned to the District, and committed a second murder at a convenience store just blocks away from the first homicide. Psychiatrists who hadtreated the youth argued they had made progressbecause he reportedly expressed regret regardingthe second murder. Pitfalls of Conventional Approaches The failures of a number of professional programs that have been launched for at-risk youths will show us that there is a need for a fundamental change inour approach to the problem, not that the situation ishopeless. There are at least four reasons why manyconventional approaches have not been effective. lMany conventional programs have been designed on the mistaken premise that the source of the problems faced by young people is external andthat the root causes of the current youth crisisare economic and financial. It is assumed thatif young people are simply offered employmentand adequate educational opportunities, the crisis will eventually be resolved. The spread of the youth problems across all income brackets provides evidence that the problem is notthe result of economic and social disadvantagealone. Even when the economy of our Nation hitbottom in the Great Depression, families and com- munities remained strong, and young people did not suffer the alienation and anxiety they suffer today. The problems affecting our Nation's youth are fun- damentally spiritual and moral in nature. Commu-nity leaders who have addressed the crisis as aspiritual problem have been remarkably effective in changing the lives of the young people they serve. The most powerful agents of transformation aregrassroots leaders whose outreach rests on prin- ciples of personal responsibility and reciprocity.Most of their efforts are faith-based and are guidedby a steadfast conviction in the God-given potentialof every human being. These neighborhood-basedinitiatives stand in sharp contrast to the conven- tional social service industry that, in essence, re- wards deviance. The clients of conventional socialservices are identified only in terms of their defi-ciencies. If you are unwed and pregnant, there is aprogram for you. If you are addicted to drugs oralcohol, there is a program. Effective community outreach, on the other hand, is aligned with the principles implied in the parableof the prodigal son. In order to be rewarded, youngpeople are first expected to fundamentally changetheir attitude, values, and behavior. In the parable, ayoung man demands his share of his father's house- hold, only to waste it away through a life of de- bauchery and immediate gratification. The father'sheart may have been broken as he witnessed his sonreaching his lowest point in life, lonely and impov-erished. Yet, he could not embrace his son unless hefirst \"came to himself\" and underwent an internal transformation through repentance and resolve. Otherwise, the father's embrace could have beenperceived as sanctioning his son's debauchery. In the same way, grassroots leaders first lead the youths they work with to a point of conversion,where they personally accept responsibility for their wrongdoings and determine to change. Conven- tional programs for youths apply therapy and envi-ronmental modifications to produce a change inbehavior, but the change is often temporary. Whenmany \"rehabilitated\" youths reenter their old envi-ronments, they adapt to them and revert to their pre- vious behavior. In contrast, faith-based neighbor- hood programs have the power to produce a lasting,substantial, internal transformation. This conversionthen results in a long-lasting, consistent change inbehavior. When \"transformed\" youths go back totheir old environments, many are not only able to resist their influence but often bring about a major transformation in their communities. lAcademic degrees and professional credentialshave been considered necessary prerequisitesof \"experts\" who should be entrusted to solvesocietal problems.Robert L. Woodson, Sr. 29\u00e4\u00e4In the arena of social policy, firsthand experience and personal commitment are not considered to bean essential part of a credible resume. Many authorswho have reaped profits from books on the crisis oftoday's young people did not even talk with theirsubjects before pontificating on their problems. Professional sociologists, psychologists, and acade- micians who have negligible personal experience of,and have had no impact on the problems they talkabout, have dominated lecture circuits and televisionshows. Meanwhile, the true experts\u2014those whohave proven track records of success in solving the problems\u2014have been ignored. In arenas including gang activity, unwed teen parenting, and substance abuse, many of the mosteffective agents of change are individuals who havepersonally experienced and overcome the problemsthey encourage others to overcome. Their daily lives provide a practical example of the values and standards they promote, and their unwavering,long-term commitment to the young people theyserve has won the confidence, trust, and respect ofyouths, even those who had been considered incor-rigible by the social service system. In spite of their effectiveness, in many cases regulations have pro- hibited such grassroots volunteers from providingservices in their neighborhoods because they lackacademic degrees or professional certification. l\"Rescuing\" a young person from his or herenvironment may not be the solution. The rescue mode of conventional programs ignores the value-generating, mediating structures that existwithin the youths' own communities (families,neighborhood associations, etc.) and may, in fact,undermine and usurp them. It is assumed that thesolution lies in the beneficence of those who are outside the community. This is true even of the much-lauded mentor pro- grams, which frequently bypass parents and neigh-bors. What message does a young person receivethrough programs that are built on the assumptionthat role models must be imported into their homes and communities? The lives of young people can- not be salvaged through outside intervention thatignores the necessity of supporting and strengthen- ing their communities. The key to establishing con-sistent and sustainable support lies in using theindigenous, \"natural antibodies\" of a community,which have the power to ward off societal disease. lFocusing on only one area of a complex of interrelated problems may not work. In contrast, personal neighborhood-based outreach addresses the whole individual and the interrelatedfactors that affect a person's life. For example, oneof the most effective substance abuse programs Ihave encountered, the San Antonio-based Victory Fellowship, does not focus exclusively on eradicat- ing drug and alcohol addiction but also incorporatesprograms to reunite and strengthen families, meetthe needs of the children of addicts, and provideeducational and employment opportunities.Through Victory Fellowship's impressive Christian version of the Boy Scouts, the Royal Rangers, young men who have successfully overcome theiraddictions function as role models for boys age 5and older, guiding them in projects of communityservice and civic responsibility. Recently, a collaboration of grassroots initiatives in Washington called Hands Across DC has created a model comprehensive strategy. Five groups havejoined forces to 'go deep' into troubled neighbor-hoods, supporting the survivors of homicide vic-tims, equipping incarcerated men to fulfill theirresponsibilities to their families and communities, and providing productive activities and educational opportunities for young people. Indigenous, grassroots, youth intervention pro- grams throughout the Nation have shown us thatsolutions to this crisis exist. Neighborhood-basedstrategies have been remarkably effective in elimi- nating rather than simply displacing youth violence. Accounts of their efforts show us, however, thatthere is no shortcut to engendering the change inyoung people's vision and values. Such internaltransformations are the harvest of long-term consis-tent effort, around-the-clock availability, and the personal example of adults who have committed themselves to a calling to salvage young lives.Revitalizing Communities and Reducing Crime 30 \u00e4 \u00e4Effective, Community-Based Youth Intervention Two men, Leon Watkins in south central Los Ange- les and Carl Hardrick in Hartford, Connecticut, livehundreds of miles apart but are linked by a commoncommitment to salvage the lives of young peoplefrom the lures of gangs and street violence. Both ofthese men have been active for more than 20 years and have worked tirelessly with minimal financial resources. Both have recognized that the most ef-fective way to influence gang members is throughexisting youth leadership structures, working withthe leaders to establish peace and to redirect activi-ties of the group toward a positive end. This is not an easy or safe venture. In the volatile world of gang violence, street-savvy youths demand authen-ticity and proven commitment before they willenter a relationship of mutual trust. Through consis-tent investment, perseverance, and in spite of greatpersonal risk, both men have been able to have a significant impact on the incidence of gang vio- lence in their communities. Leon Watkins: Los Angeles, California In 1979, Leon Watkins launched his effort to stopthe waste of young lives in senseless violence insouth central Los Angeles. He created the SanPedro Business Association to develop alternative activities and employment opportunities for youths. In a door-to-door campaign to business owners inthe community, Leon enlisted support for the jobs-creation project. In return for their participation,Leon worked to protect store owners who wereoften the targets of theft and extortion. He posted reward notices throughout the community, asking that any tips regarding crimes in the neighborhoodbe reported to what he dubbed the \"FamilyHelpline.\" In time, this helpline would become ananchor of information exchange and crisis counsel-ing for the community, but in the beginning, the hotline was simply one man, Leon, and a telephone booth. Fearless, Watkins began his antiviolence efforts by seeking out the leader of one of the city's mostnotorious gangs, a youth whose street name wasQuake. Leon recalls:I just put the word out on the streets that I was looking for Quake, and then one day asI was walking through an alley, a car pulledalongside and one guy stepped out and wasflanked by four of his friends. He said heheard I was looking for him and asked what I wanted to talk about. I just answered, \"about what you are doing with your life.\"We talked that day, and then many othertimes when I found him on the street. Arelationship began to build, and he couldsee that what I was saying made sense. Gang life was a one-way street to prison or a coffin. He was ready to change, and hewas willing to help me reach the kids thatwere under his control. The majority of Quake's gang members did respond and followed his lead in participating in the first graffiti removal project in the neighborhood. There were some who didn't want to stop \"gang banging,\"but most, like Quake, were ready to change. Thegraffiti was a constant reminder of the lives that hadbeen claimed in turf wars. It was a powerful state-ment for the gang members to paint over the graf- fiti. Since the day of that historic cleanup project, Leon has continued to reach and change the livesof young people. In the following statement, he describes an attitude that is necessary to win theresponse of gang members: Before you come into a young person's life, telling him to change, you must understand the vital role that gang membership playsin his life. You have to recognize the valuethat the gang has in the eyes of these youngpeople, and you have to give their reality itsdue respect. Many gang members would literally rather die than renounce this life, because it is the only place in their entirelives where they have found respect. It isthe only culture that has embraced them.They have been rejected by the larger soci-ety. Here in their gangs, young people who have been abused in their own homes have found a place to go where they will not onlybe accepted but respected and where it ispossible for them to receive a rank of ac-complishment [different levels of leadershipRobert L. Woodson, Sr. 31\u00e4\u00e4and standing within the gang]. You cannot just walk in and tell them to drop what theyhave found. If you understand this, andrespect it, you will have some foundationto begin to talk with these kids, and you canestablish a level of communication where they can hear what you have to say. Some people just come in and criticize the gangs and tell the kids how bad it is to be ina gang. What are they offering as an alter-native? What are they telling those kids thatthey can do if they leave their gangs? The kids already know what society considers to be right or wrong. What we fail to under-stand is the far-reaching impact of despair.How can you measure the pain a personfeels when he is hurt and shut out fromsociety? When there is no trustable alterna- tive, when they have seen other lifestyles filled with hypocrisy, all young people aresusceptible to the call of the gang. Recruit-ment begins in elementary schools, and itknows no racial or economic boundaries.Even a young boy singing in a choir can be drawn to affiliate with this culture. All the kids know about it. It is always there, pull-ing them, and the first time they get into aserious crisis, they will enter that culture. I try to get to the most practical level. I work with an individual until he can verbal- ize his own personal goal. I try to uncover what his own dream for his life is. I veryseldom talk about negative things when Italk with them about what they are doing.I work on the premise that, deep inside,they have a vision for what they could be, and I work to pull out what they have inside and to make them aware of the intelligenceand talent they possess. In most cases, I cansense that these young people are in pain,deep pain. That pain turns to anger, and iterupts in situations where they lash out and begin killing each other. And a cycle of vio- lence begins. You have to cut through allof this and get down to the individual. Youhave to get him to the point where he canlook at himself and the overall picture. Hehas to believe that he has a future and that he is worth something.Carl Hardrick: Hartford, Connecticut Like Leon Watkins, Carl Hardrick began his youth intervention efforts in the 1970s. Residents of theBelleview Square community of Hartford were be-ing held in a virtual state of siege by warring gangs.The elderly locked themselves inside their homesand were afraid to come out. Only three residents dared to come out to a public meeting in the neigh- borhood about the rampant violence. Carl describesthe strategy he adopted to reach the gangs. Similarto Leon Watkins' strategy, it involved workingthrough the gang structure and its leader. One of the most notorious gangs in Hart- ford in 1975 was the \"Magnificent Twen- ties.\" Its leader represented a huge popula-tion of nearly 1,100 youths who came fromall over the city. Senior citizens and otherresidents of the Belleview Square commu-nity couldn't function. They locked them- selves in the house when they came home, and they were afraid to come out. We hada meeting in Belleview Square and onlyabout two or three people showed up. Theytold me that they were very concernedabout the gang and the violence that was going down in the community. At that point, I went out to seek the leader- ship of the gang. The name that kept com-ing up was Steven Holter. Steven was ayoung man who was labeled as 'learningdisabled,' yet he controlled 1,100 young men and was pretty much responsible for their actions. I began to work with Steveand talk about what he was doing. There was another gang at that time that wasn't as strong as Steve's but was prettybig, with a membership of about 500. The two gangs were having feuds and going at each other. What I attempted to do withSteve was to talk about the things that hewas doing that were negative and to beginto work with him to turn around to do posi-tive things. As I worked with the leader- ship, Steve, in turn, worked with the youths who were directly under him. The strategyI developed to work with the gangs and mydiscovery of the things that work startedback then.Revitalizing Communities and Reducing Crime 32 \u00e4 \u00e4At that time, we were invited to attend a gang workshop at the Urban League to talkabout our successes and to see what otherpeople were doing. That is where I first metBob Woodson, who was coordinating thatfirst gang workshop. Sister Falaka Fattah was there from the House of Umoja, a gang intervention effort that reached thousandsof youths in Philadelphia. We also met\"Fat Rob,\" a former gang member who hadplayed an important role in addressing theproblem of gang violence in Philadelphia, and we began to exchange information. We were able to dialogue with people whowere working with young people through-out the Nation, and at that time Philadel-phia had the biggest gang problem. As theyouths interacted, they began to talk about what could be done to stop the violence. After that time, we established a good rela- tionship with the people in Philadelphia,and Fat Rob would come to Hartford when-ever there was difficulty. Fat Rob was com-mitted to making peace. He was responsible for bringing all those brothers to the table. So that was the beginning of my work. We took a negative situation, in a very explo-sive environment, and we turned it into apositive. Steven and his followers wentfrom gang banging to hosting dances in the community, providing escorts for senior citizens, and sponsoring a youth day anda community day. They served in everyaspect where there was a way for them tofit in. We found out that when you give kidspositive things to do, you get positive re- sults. It's difficult to dismantle a gang. But you can change the attitude and behavior ofa gang, and once you do that, they willchange themselves. As the years went on, these kids grew up. Some of them went to school. Some went to college. Some of them remained out there and went to jail. But the majority ofthem got jobs and married and are doingfine today.In that process, we learned that Steve Holter and Fat Rob had much in commonand that they were natural leaders. But wecouldn't give them the tools or the expertisethat they needed to diffuse a lot of whatthey saw was happening on the streets. In a sense, they predicted what would be hap- pening now. Back in the '70s and '80s theysaid, \"If you think that we are tough, watchwhat our little brothers will be like. Theywill be much harder, much crueler, andmuch deadlier.\" When we sought the reason that young people were involved in gangs, we learnedthat the gangs filled a gap that was left inthe absence of solid family and communitystructures. The gang fulfilled the role of anextended family. The need for this kind of relationship was natural, though the gangs themselves turned to negative activities. The gang became an essential part of the lives of many young people and we couldnot just step in and tell them to leave thoserelationships behind. Instead, our task was to work through the leadership structures and network of influence to lead the youthsto positive behavior. Our first challengewas to convince them to bring their differ-ences to the table\u2014where they could talkthem out\u2014rather than the streets where they fought them out. There are times when I am criticized for meeting with gang members by people whowould rather address the problem throughofficials and community representatives.But I know of a meeting called by those officials that was organized with 3-months notice yet had only 8 participants. Comparethat with 1,300 who came to a meeting with1-day notice. Compare the responses tothose two meetings and you will see whois controlling that community. To turn the situation around, you had to deal with the leadership. In some cases,kids were being forced into gang activity.When Steve Holter and I visited schoolsRobert L. Woodson, Sr. 33\u00e4\u00e4and talked about making the right deci- sions, kids would come up and ask, \"Whatdo you do when someone comes up to youand puts a gun to the side of your head andasks, 'Who are you down with?' You wouldsay 'I'm going with you.'\" You have to show the kids that what they are doing is damaging to the community. You have to bethere for them and sacrifice for them untilthey believe in you. And once you approachthem, you have to be in there for the longhaul and offer solutions. In Hartford, we were able to convince a number of gang leaders, who had streetnames such as \"Bird\" and \"Bookman,\" thatthere is another way. They were ready tochange. They didn't want to continue downa pathway to destruction. Yet, there was no one to tell them how they could make that change. When they did, the turnaround wasremarkable. They went from being enforc-ers to being peacemakers. They knew thatit was better to solve their problems at thetable than on the streets. I believe that there were more people who wanted peace than war, but no one was talking to these youngpeople. When you get them to the table andclear up the confusion and find out whatthe real issues are, you will get a sense thatthey all want the same things. Then you can work together to address those issues. First, you have to establish yourself and show your sincerity and commitment overtime if the young people are to respond.There is no shortcut to that. It takes timeand investment. It doesn't happen over- night, but once there is visible progress, the whole community will begin to change.Once the young people declare, \"This iswhat we want to do,\" you can hold them tothat. In a sense, they will force themselvesinto doing the right thing. Often, when grassroots leaders approach government agencies, they are ques-tioned\u2014not about their outcomes and strat-egies but about their credentials. When acity launches a program to do gang media-tion, the people who are successful with thekids on the streets seldom apply for the job. If these programs are to be effective, theyshould value effective experience as muchas certificates and diplomas, and theyshould enlist the people who can reach theyouths who are making decisions. The value of an intervention strategy is determined by its fruits, its results. One ofthe first gang leaders I worked with, SteveHolter, is now the owner of a bonded con-struction company and has currently beencontracted for a $4-million project. From a position of success, he is now able to reach back and hire former gang members andat-risk youths. He understands where theyare coming from. He sets down the rules,and then he trusts them and assigns themthe work. He knows that someone once took the time and made the investment to give him a break. I just wish that I hadmore Steves, and that he had more work. It is important, once the young people are willing to turn themselves around, that youhave opportunities for them and that you can keep them busy. In Hartford, the Upper Al- bany Neighborhood Collaborative launcheda project for youth enterprises. Young peoplehad entrepreneurial skills and innovativeideas, but they were selling the wrong prod-ucts. This project came as a result of an as- sessment we conducted on the neighborhood's needs and capacities. It was one example ofhow, with proper support, young people canturn their negatives into positives. The kids responded immediately. They wrote business plans and even talked of franchising some services. Former gang members came up with detailed plans forsmall enterprises such as Jeanie's laundromat,Bird's bakery, and Bookman's barbershop.But now that [entrepreneurial] project ison hold. The most pressing need was for capital investment. Conventional lending institutions did not want to take the riskinvolved in new businesses such as these.Even if the project has come to a halt, thekids are still looking forward to these enter-prises: they still have their dreams.Revitalizing Communities and Reducing Crime 34 \u00e4 \u00e4The strategies that were successful in Hart- ford can work in other cities as well. I wishwe could take a corps of these youngpeople and \"go deep\" into other cities, stay-ing there for a year and setting the founda-tion for things to turn around. Kids from other cities will respond to what the former gang members from Hartford have to saybecause they can relate to them, and theyrecognize leadership. The ones who havecome through successfully have \"beenthere.\" They did it. They know the situation that other kids are in, and they also know the consequences of not falling in line. A transformation could spread in the same way that destructive behavior spread. Whenthe Crips and Bloods spread out from LosAngeles, they were organized around violent gang enforcement. The same network and organization can apply in a positive direction. It's important to reach the kids before they go to prison or get involved in the kindsof activities that will take them to prison.Once you have identified the youths who are ready to change and you start working with them, they will respond. They reallydon't want to live a life on the line. Thereis a \"ripple\" effect from the kids who turntheir lives around. Once Steve Holter madethat change, he was able to reach thousands of other young people I couldn't reach. As each young person is helped, they will passon the baton. That is why you can antici-pate expanding results. There is powerwhen someone says, \"That is where I was.I used to do that, but I'm not doing it any- more, and let me tell you why.\" Acknowledging Grassroots Victories In spite of the remarkable success of neighborhood- based initiatives for at-risk youths, grassrootsoutreach has received little public recognition.Typically, even the most effective programs havereceived one of the following responses: they are ignored, they are dismissed as chance occurrencesof charismatic leadership, or they are awarded to- ken accolades rather than substantial support. It issaid that, when compared to the scale of the prob-lem, their successes are limited. Rather than dismissing the success of these grassroots efforts, we should be investing all of our energy and resources to learn how we can expand, multiply, and \"export\" their effective strategies.We should treat their victories as we would treat amedical breakthrough. If, for example, in laboratoryexperiments, just three out of hundreds of mice thatwere exposed to the AIDS virus were discovered to be immune from the disease, all resources would be invested in an effort to understand what factors con-tributed to their survival. Their case would inspirehope and would be on the front pages of newspa-pers throughout the world. The success of grassroots leaders such as Leon Watkins and Carl Hardrick has precedents in com- munity-based outreach that has been going on formore than two decades. One of these precedents isthe effective youth intervention strategy that wasemployed in the city of Philadelphia during thesummer of 1973. At that time, the city was para- lyzed with fear as small gangs of marauding black youths arbitrarily targeted citizens on the streetsand in shopping malls. In what police termed as\"wolf pack\" attacks, the victims were knocked tothe ground and stripped of rings, watches, goldchains, wallets, and purses. A virtual reign of terror spread as reports of the at- tacks were published and other youths joined in themelee. Because these robberies were not connectedto organized gangs and occurred sporadically, policeand law enforcement officials found it impossibleto predict or contain the rash of attacks. Neither increased police patrols nor emergency funding to traditional social service institutions had any impacton the problem. As the city was held hostage in thiscrime wave, movie theaters closed early, stores andshopping centers shut down, and many civic eventswere canceled. Public officials were at a point of hopelessness when two grassroots leaders stepped forward with a unique strategy. Within 1 day of theimplementation of their plan, the attacks ceased andnever again resumed.Robert L. Woodson, Sr. 35\u00e4\u00e4Valuable guidelines for addressing the current epidemic of youth crime and gang violence canbe gained by studying who it was who solvedPhiladelphia's crisis and the resources they enlistedin their solution. The agents of this successful strat-egy, David and Falaka Fattah, were well-known veteran community activists who had discovered that one of their own six sons was an active gangmember. At that time, Philadelphia was known asthe youth gang capital of the Nation. Newspaperspublished statistics of victims of gang violenceweekly next to the death tolls of the Vietnam war. In responding to their son's gang activity, the Fattahs reached out to embrace his circle of friendsrather than trying to isolate him from them, inviting13 of the youths to come to live with them in theirsmall row house in West Philadelphia. This infor-mal arrangement blossomed into a gang rescue program called the House of Umoja. Word of the safe haven soon spread on the streets, and the number of young gang members seekingasylum steadily increased. Within a few years, theinfluence of the Fattahs' outreach spread throughoutthe entire city, and they were able to coordinate a citywide peace pact that dramatically reduced the annual number of gang-related homicides. TheFattahs brought this established reputation and foun-dation of trust and respect with them when theycame to the table to address the crisis of the wolf-pack attacks. Their first step was to call in the \"experts\" with invaluable street experience, former gang members\u2014the \"Old Heads\" or \"OGs\"\u2014theyhad worked with. This group suggested a collabora-tive effort with their counterparts who were incarcer-ated at the local prison, the \"House of Correction.\" When the Fattahs sent out a call for help in stopping the violence, more than 130 inmates signed up to join a crime-prevention task force. The prisonersidentified young people who were influential ontheir \"corners\" in their neighborhoods who wereinvited to a conference at the prison the followingSaturday. The response was overwhelming. On the day of the conference, buses ferried more than 300 youths to the prison. After hearing presentationsfrom the inmates on personal responsibility andmoral obligation, the group broke up into smallerworkshops and discussion groups focused on endingthe violence. The following day peace prevailed.Although the Fattahs and their group received offi- cial recognition from the mayor, the acknowledg-ment of their unique ability to reach the city'syoung people was more ceremonial than substan-tive. When funds were later allocated for crime pre-vention or youth services, they were designated for conventional social service programs and for in- creased police patrols. The Fattahs were applaudedbut then ignored. Our national strategy, likewise, has failed to provide substantial support for alternative grassroots re-sponses to youth crime and gang activity, in spite of its undeniable effectiveness. While plaques may be bestowed on numerous successful neighborhood-based antigang efforts, there has been no effort todevelop structures that can harness the capacities ofgrassroots initiatives to sustain and expand their im-pact. Instead, as in the case of the Fattahs, massive funding has been channeled to conventional social programs, therapeutic treatment, police interdiction,and incarceration. We cannot afford to continue to ignore our most powerful agents of healing and transformation. TheNation's attention should be focused on the impact that these models of excellence have had on the youths in their communities. All our energies andresources should be invested in understanding howsuccesses that have been achieved in low-incomeneighborhoods could be adapted and appliedthroughout society. Until now, we have been un- willing to study the strategies of grassroots leaders who have claimed a beachhead in the battle againstyouth crime and gang activity. Men and womenwho have reached and changed the lives of hun-dreds of young people have accomplished dramaticresults, against the greatest odds, with meager resources. If we were to invest in them just a small portion of what we have squandered on ineffective,top-down programs, we could salvage the future ofthe next generation. Exporting and Adapting a Successful Youth InterventionModel Recently, a remarkably effective grassroots youth intervention effort in one of Washington, D.C.'s, most crime-ridden areas has alerted policymakersRevitalizing Communities and Reducing Crime 36 \u00e4 \u00e4and law enforcement officials to the power of neighborhood healing agents. The Benning Terrace public housing development appeared a hopeless case to David Gilmore, the offi-cial in charge of Washington, D.C.'s, public housing,when he conducted his first tour of the properties that were entrusted to his management. His driver refused to turn into Benning Terrace and opted tomerely slow down as they passed the site, whichwas notorious for its violence: 59 homicides hadbeen reported in a 5-month period. Gilmore re-counts, \"I saw the devastated conditions that have been a day-to-day reality for families for many, many months, perhaps even years. The area wasfilthy, ill-maintained, and ill-equipped. It was silentand deserted, with one exception. The stoop of oneunit was guarded by a group of fierce-looking youngmen. With their caps pulled down, huddled in big Starter jackets, even in the sweltering summer heat, their message was clear: 'We dare you to approachus.'\" At that time, Gilmore believed that he had onlyone option for dealing with this property. He wouldtear the buildings down and disperse their residentsto other locations. In spite of the hopelessness of the scenario in the summer of 1997, those buildings were not razed, and,though they remain, today the site bears little resem-blance to the scene Gilmore encountered scarcelymore than a year ago. The graffiti that once defacedthose buildings is gone. Well-planned flower beds and lawns have replaced litter-strewn lots. Neigh- bors chat on their front stoops and little children areeverywhere\u2014playing on a once-desolate footballfield, riding bicycles, and practicing basketballshots. The members of youth factions whose turfwars had once virtually held the residents hostage still reside in the development, but they, too, are scarcely recognizable. In Gilmore's words, \"Today,there is not only life and laughter in the community,but there is light and hope beginning to shine in theeyes of those young men. Their dreams and aspira-tions had always been there, but now they have been awakened. They have been given the opportunity to step back from the conflict and to see who theyreally are. Recently, two of those once-callousedyoung men risked their lives and suffered injuriesto pull babies from a burning unit in their develop-ment. They possess more heart than you can imag- ine, and they have a desire to live.\"The agents of this transformation are members of a grassroots organization, the Alliance of ConcernedMen, which evolved from a common commitmentthat five men made to help the next generation ofyoung men deal with the lures of gangs, drugs, andcrime that had once nearly claimed their own lives. The Alliance first became affiliated with the Na- tional Center for Neighborhood Enterprise (NCNE)as members of a project entitled Hands Across DC.The eight participants in this project are Washing-ton-based grassroots initiatives ranging fromsafehouses and youth intervention programs to sup- port groups for families of homicide victims. Hands Across DC provided two types of linkage. Internally,participants shared ideas, strategies, and encourage-ment with one another. Externally, connections weremade with private institutions and individuals whocould provide resources for their efforts. The Alliance was aware that NCNE's nationwide network of community-based programs includeda number of counterparts that had implementedeffective strategies to quell gang warfare. Whenyouth violence at Benning Terrace climaxed withthe abduction and murder of a 12-year-old boy, the members of the Alliance made a commitment to go into that community and devote themselves tostopping the violence. They requested NCNE'sassistance in coordinating communication withother youth intervention programs as a first stepin developing their strategy. NCNE arranged for a conference call between members of the Alliance and two other grassrootsyouth intervention \"experts\"\u2014Carl Hardrick, whohas worked with youths in Hartford, Connecticut,for more than 20 years, and Omar Jahwar, a23-year-old in Dallas, Texas, who established an antiviolence youth development program that has instilled a sense of vision and value in hundreds ofyoung people, both within correctional institutionsand in the community. The advice given by these grassroots leaders coin- cided with the experience and natural instincts of the Alliance: to reach the youths and win their trust, they should identify and work through the estab-lished leaders of each of the youth factions. Themen went into the neighborhood and went to thehomes of residents who were familiar with themand their work. The residents told the AllianceRobert L. Woodson, Sr. 37\u00e4\u00e4which youths were influential, and they arranged for them to meet and talk with these leaders. Aftera period of consistent outreach by the Alliance, theyouths admitted that they wanted the killing to stopbut didn't know how to begin: unilateral disarma-ment seemed the equivalent of suicide. The Alliance convinced representatives from each faction to meet to discuss the possibility of a peacepact. The offices of NCNE were neutral territorywhere the talks could be held. A series of closed-door meetings were held in which the youthsworked out terms of a truce. The Alliance per- formed the role of facilitator as the young men described their vision for what the neighborhoodcould be and listed the resources that they thoughtwould be needed to bring revitalization to theircommunity: Among these were a recreation centerand the means for themselves and their families to travel beyond the neighborhood boundaries. On January 29, 1997, a peace pact was forged, and NCNE went into swift action to alert the press, hop-ing that media coverage of this victory would elicitprivate-sector support for the renewal of the com-munity. The story of Benning Terrace appeared in news media from the New York Times, Washington Post, and Washington Times to ABC News. Whilethe story engendered inspiration and hope, itevoked little concrete support\u2014with the exceptionof the response of public housing official DavidGilmore, who was moved to offer crucial opportu- nities for job training and employment to the young men who were at a vulnerable point in their trans-formation. The youths eagerly embraced jobs suchas landscaping, graffiti removal, and repair work for$6.50 an hour, dispelling the notion that they wouldnever give up a lucrative life of crime or drug trade for low-paying but steady jobs. One of the greatest skeptics of the truce, a gang leader named Derrick who had been dubbed by po-lice as one of the seven most dangerous individualsin the District, became one of its most faithful con-verts. He would rise early to inspect and water the flower beds his crew had planted before reporting for work. Another young man who was inspired bythe potential of a job training opportunity exhibitedremarkable determination to complete his course.When his car broke down, he rode a bicycle to hisclasses. When even the bike broke down, he picked it up and literally carried it to the job training site. Through the committed efforts of the Alliance, the lives of 35 young men and their families have beenchanged forever. A newspaper column recently re-counted how one newly employed young man liter- ally broke into tears as he signed health insurance papers for his little daughters, realizing that, for thefirst time, he could provide them with security andreliable support. The courageous intervention of the Alliance of Concerned Men, supported by the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, has yielded the following results: lThirty-five young men have rejected a lifestylethat destroyed their neighborhood and havebecome productive, contributing members oftheir community. lA cycle of despair and violence has beenstopped and reversed as young fathers takeresponsibility for their children and older youthsfunction as positive role models for youngstersin the neighborhood. lA community once considered off-limits for business ventures or services is now \"open for business.\" lTo date, the housing authority projects cost sav-ings of nearly $2 million from this intervention,at a site that was previously slated for demolitiondue to crime that was deemed uncontrollable. This immediate assistance from the housing authority provided a \"missing link\" that previousgrassroots youth crime interventions have lackeddue to bureaucratic indifference to such effortsin many cities. lA model of youth intervention has been estab- lished that can be exported and adapted in other cities and regions throughout the Nation. Thetruce between rival youth factions that wasbrokered by the Alliance with NCNE supporthas become a catalyst for initiation of otheryouth peacemaking efforts by the Alliance in 10 crime-ridden Washington, D.C., public housing sites to date.Revitalizing Communities and Reducing Crime 38 \u00e4 \u00e4Policy Recommendations The grassroots intervention at Benning Terrace has received consistent support from Eric Holder, whooffered his offices as a former U.S. Attorney and asthe current Deputy Attorney General to support lawenforcement partnerships with the youth initiative. Anew effort with the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department\u2014Operation Fresh Start\u2014could serve as a model for bringing formerly delinquentyouths through a process of legal validation as a re-ward for renouncing destructive behaviors. Throughthis program, youths receive counsel and guidanceto deal with past offenses and outstanding child support payments. On May 8, 1997, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde and Ranking MinorityMember John Conyers convened a full committeehearing to examine the policy implications of thisgrassroots youth intervention success. In addition to the Alliance of Concerned Men, Carl Hardrick of the Hartford Youth Peace Initiative, Leon Watkinsof the Los Angeles Family Helpline, and their coun-terparts from other cities were invited to testify.The Judiciary Committee leadership has committeditself to a partnership with NCNE to fully examine the national policy implications of this grassroots youth crime intervention. With the support of the U.S. Department of Hous- ing and Urban Development (HUD), NCNE hascommenced planning for the Hartford Youth PeaceInitiative and hired a third-party evaluator to docu- ment program results. A \"best practices\" manual and tool kit will be developed for use in other high-crime housing sites around the country. Among the policy recommendations NCNE is making are the following: lA seven-city National Demonstration of Grassroots Youth Crime Intervention Success should be established, with the goal of creating\"Violence Free Zones\" similar to the BenningTerrace intervention in Washington, D.C. NCNEis already planning the intervention in four of thecities (Hartford, Dallas, Los Angeles, and the District of Columbia). With appropriate invest- ment, NCNE is prepared to establish a 3-year,multisite demonstration through a public-privatepartnership in support of local grassroots anti-crime initiatives that could be fully documented in terms of cost savings as well as its impact inreducing the death rate among at-risk youths. lThe District of Columbia Housing Authority'saffirmative support for the grassroots youth crimeintervention success at Benning Terrace should be examined by policymakers as a model for public housing agencies nationwide. NCNE is inthe process of capturing this process through abest practices manual supported by HUD. lOperation Fresh Start should be supported by theU.S. Department of Justice for replication in other communities, as a vehicle to \"mainstream\" youths who are making the constructive transi-tion from violent to productive citizens and\"ambassadors of peace\" to other communities. lThe Office of Juvenile Justice and DelinquencyPrevention's antidrug technical assistance voucher program operated by NCNE can serve as a model of support to build capacity forgrassroots youth crime initiatives. The proce-dures and lessons learned from this nationalinitiative could be incorporated as an eligibleactivity within State juvenile justice block grants. lThe prohibition of effective faith-based drug treatment programs for juvenile delinquentsshould be removed through reform of archaicand counterproductive licensing and credentialingrequirements. In addition, \"Charitable Choice\" provisions, which bar discrimination against faith-based drug treatment programs, should beexpanded to include all forms of Federal anti-drug assistance. The biggest hurdle that remains to be overcome is a prejudice against information and experience offered by the untutored, the uncredentialed, the unanointed. For the sake of this Nation, we mustovercome the elitism that is at the core of this bias.We must have the wisdom to listen and learn fromthe men and women who, with quiet tenacity, haveestablished track records of success and effective- ness in addressing our Nation's most critical prob- lems. We must have the humility to recognize themas our guides and to provide the support they willneed to continue and expand their efforts.Robert L. Woodson, Sr. 39\u00e4\u00e4Notes 1.

Ibid.41\u00e4\u00e4Cooling the Hot Spots of Homicide: A Plan for Action Lawrence W. Sherman The Rocky Mountains andthe Prairie The geographic distribution of homicide can be compared to the geographic distribution of elevation in the United States. Consider an elevation map of the country. Most of us recognize the familiar bulgeof the Eastern mountains in the Appalachian chainand the high peaks of the Rocky Mountains in theWest. Few are surprised that the highest mountain inthe United States is Mount McKinley in Alaska at 20,320 feet and that Death Valley in California is the lowest point at 282 feet below sea level. What many people find surprising is that the aver- age elevation of the United States is 2,500 feet, even though most Americans live far below thataverage. (For comparison, the average elevation of Washington, D.C., is 150 feet above sea level.) Forty-two States have average elevations lower thanthe national average, and only Denver and a fewother cities have large populations at or above theaverage elevation. It is safe to assume that 90 per-cent or more of all Americans live below the aver- age elevation (Wright, 1992: 47). It is equally safe to assume that 90 percent or more of all Americans live within census tracts or smallgeographical neighborhoods where the homiciderate is well below the national average. Even in cit-ies like Chicago, the homicide rate in middle-class neighborhoods such as Hyde Park is comparable to that of Sweden and is 80 percent lower than the na-tional average. Yet 100 yards to the south of HydePark lies Woodlawn, where the homicide rate in1996 was 12 times the national average (Crime Pre-vention Effectiveness Program, ongoing research). The cumulative effect of neighborhoods like Woodlawn on the overall homicide rate is similarto the effect of the Rocky Mountains on the meanThe most useful role the Federal Government can play in decreasing crime is to develop and support effective methods for reducing gun violence in na- tional hot spots of homicide. While other goals areimportant, this one is by far the most important. Itis also the most challenging. It requires that we putrecent good news into context, that we understandthe geographic concentrations of gun violence, that we rethink the current patterns of Federal spending, and that we focus on learning about what works inthe small number of neighborhoods that suffer mostof the gun violence. Good News in Context The good news is that homicide rates are dropping.The decreases are substantial. They are long term. And they are concentrated in the inner-city poverty areas where homicide increased in epidemic pro-portions in the late 1960s and late 1980s. New YorkCity experienced a drop from 2,262 homicides in1992 to 767 in 1997, a two-thirds decrease. Thenumber of homicides in Los Angeles in 1997 dropped more than 40 percent from 1993, when they hovered around 1,000. In 1997, Washington,D.C., had the lowest homicide count in a decade atslightly over 300, down from almost 400 the yearbefore (Roane, 1998; Suro, 1997). The bad news is that homicide rates in urban areas of concentrated poverty remain far higher than they are in the rest of the United States. Our national ho-micide rate therefore remains far higher than it is inany other economically advanced nation. Althoughthe rates of white-on-white homicide in the ruralUnited States remain much higher than national homicide rates in many other comparable nations (Zimring and Hawkins, 1997: 80), the extraordinar-ily high concentrations of homicide in certain inner-city areas drive the national homicide rate to adegree that few Americans appreciate.Cooling the Hot Spots of Homicide: A Plan for Action 42 \u00e4 \u00e4elevation of the United States. Almost half (44 per- cent) of all homicides in 1996 occurred in only 47 ofapproximately 14,000 police jurisdictions in theUnited States (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 1997).The concentration within those cities is almost asgreat. A recent University of Maryland survey of homicides by census tract in large cities found that less than 1 percent of the U.S. population producedmore than 10 percent of the homicides (Crime Preven-tion Effectiveness Program, ongoing research). Most Americans live at a very low risk of homicide, by both national and world standards. If we want to reduce homicide in America, we would be ill advised to spread our resources equally acrossthe entire Nation. If we want to lower our averageelevation, we would be ill advised to bulldoze theprairie simply because more land mass is there.Knocking down the mountain peaks would lower the average elevation far more effectively. The case for focusing on homicide is very strong. As Zimring and Hawkins (1997) have shown, therates of most types of crime in the United Statesare as low or lower than they are in other advancedeconomies. Even the rate of all violent crimes is lower in the United States than it is in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand (Crime PreventionEffectiveness Program, ongoing research). Whatgives the United States its reputation as a high-crime country are its homicides and robberies,which comprise only a small fraction of all violent crimes. The United States has a very high rate among the advanced economies for these crimesand these alone, although even these rates are lowerthan in many developing nations. Serious injuries from gun violence remain unmea- sured in the national crime data, but such injuries are believed to closely track homicide rates. These injuries occur at several times the rate of homicidesand cause far more pain and suffering throughdisability and lifetime impact on quality of life.Economic costs of these injuries make gun violenceamong the most expensive of all crimes (Crime Pre- vention Effectiveness Program, ongoing research). Crime prevention programs could easily pay forthemselves in reduced health and social welfareexpenditures of tax dollars if effective programsfocused on the peaks, or hot spots, of gun violence.But that is far from how Federal dollars are focused at present.The Spending Mismatch Almost $4 billion per year in Federal crime preven- tion assistance is given out primarily on the basis ofpopulation rather than homicide rates. Put bluntly,the money goes where the votes are, not wherethe crime is. If we divide the number of dollars ofFederal aid based on population by the number of homicides, we see that four of the lowest homicide States get almost $1 million in Federal aid perhomicide, while a city with an above-average homi-cide rate like Mobile, Alabama, gets only $200,000per homicide, and the highest homicide rate neigh-borhood in Chicago gets only $6,000 per homicide (Crime Prevention Effectiveness Program, ongoing research). This distribution does not reflect the concentration of homicide in America. In 1996, there were almostas many homicides in Mobile, Alabama (51), asthere were in New Hampshire (20), Vermont (11), South Dakota (9), and North Dakota (14) com- bined. Yet with only 207,000 residents in Mobileand 3.1 million in these 4 States, a population-based formula allocates 15 times as much Federalfunding per homicide to the low-crime areas.Compared to West Garfield Park in Chicago, these 4 States receive approximately 150 times as much Federal aid per homicide (Crime Prevention Effec-tiveness Program, ongoing research). Even within States and cities, there is no formula requirement to put Federal money where the homi-cides are. Even the one Federal program (Local Law Enforcement Block Grants) that takes crime explicitly into account in allocating funding makesno attempt to direct funds to the highest crimeneighborhoods (Crime Prevention EffectivenessProgram, ongoing research). It is entirely legal,although arguably a missed opportunity, to spend Federal funds outside of the areas that need them the most\u2014again because those areas in need maylack sufficient political clout. Learning What Works Even if Federal funds were spent in the areas ofgreatest need, there is no guarantee that \"throwingmoney\" at the homicide rates will reduce them. \"Throwing knowledge\" at the problems, however, could do more good. The role for which the FederalLawrence W. Sherman 43\u00e4\u00e4Government is uniquely suited is as the producer of such knowledge, through the proven methods oftrial and error, research, and development. Nowhere is the distinction between money and know-how more apparent than in the Woodlawnarea of Chicago. At a rate of 91 homicides per 100,000 residents (or 21 homicides among its esti- mated 23,000 people), Woodlawn is not the highesthomicide peak in the Chicago mountain range;that distinction went to West Garfield Park in 1996,at 217 homicides per 100,000 residents, almost30 times the national average rate (Crime Preven- tion Effectiveness Program, ongoing research). But the Woodlawn rate is important for what it saysabout our capacity to use community organizationsand government intervention to decrease crime andrevitalize communities. If there is any neighbor-hood in America that has attempted or received more efforts of that kind in the past three decades, I would be surprised. Despite the resources and the community control that have been created in Woodlawn, the homiciderate remains far too high. So what is to be done?My distinguished former colleague George Kelling has recently suggested that communities need to do many things, but they do not need social scienceevaluations to guide them in choosing effectivepolicies (COSSA Washington Update , 1997). Offered by the leader of one of the most importantsocial science evaluations in history, the Kansas City Preventive Patrol Experiment (Kelling et al., 1974), Kelling's opinion on this question is veryimportant, although I disagree with it. The reasons we have failed to see a good return on Federal investment in many hot spots of homicideare complex and manifold. One reason is that we have failed to approach the process systematically, in a way that allows us to learn from our mistakes.It is often said that a nation capable of puttingpeople on the moon ought to be able to solve itshomicide problem. Yet it is rarely said that we havefailed to use careful methods of controlled testing in our attempts to deal with homicide. Had we used the same sloppy methods on the space program, wewould still be trying to get a rocket off the ground.Crime prevention programs need evaluations as their primary purpose, not as an afterthought. Untilwe know what works, our primary task is to answerthat question and not just throw in everything butthe kitchen sink. Once we know what works andwhat doesn't work, we can do more of the former and less of the latter. But if we disregard the need for evaluation, we will be fooling around with theproblem from here to eternity. This point is most important when defining the Federal role. It is arguable as to whether the FederalGovernment should redistribute income to support effective homicide prevention programs in high- homicide areas. After all, that can also be done byStates and cities. But what the States and cities can- not do is launch national tests of effective methods. Such field tests are absolutely vital, yet they havenever been done. As a matter of science, it is essential to study what scientists call the \"unit of analysis.\" To attack thehomicide problem in the United States and learnwhat works, we must focus on the relevant unit ofanalysis: the hot-spot neighborhoods where mosthomicides are concentrated. Most federally funded evaluations of programs in such neighborhoods have examined them one at a time. As a matter ofscientific method, that is a woefully inadequateapproach and may be a major waste of money.Unless we start to use larger samples of homicidehot spots, including multicity experiments, we will remain uncertain about what works to reduce gun violence. A Plan for Action The following steps are not easy to accomplish, butthey do offer the best prospect for the long-termcapacity of this Nation to control its number onecrime problem: the high rate of homicides. If we fail to take these steps, we will watch homicide rates rise and fall without any knowledge of whatcauses them to change. If we do take these steps,we can start to build on what the National Instituteof Justice and other federally funded research hasalready shown about the patterns and control ofCooling the Hot Spots of Homicide: A Plan for Action 44 \u00e4 \u00e4crime (Sherman et al., 1997). To summarize, the steps include: 1. Putting the money where the homicides are. Census tracts or other small geographical areaswith homicide rates five or more times higher thanthe national average should receive at least half of all Federal crime prevention funding. 2. Making evaluation the primary purpose of Federal aid. This means that Federal programs should be designed around strong evaluations,rather than weak evaluations tacked onto programsafter they are already set in motion. 3. Using large samples of homicide hot spots, including multicity evaluation programs. Only this approach will make it possible to rule out themany rival explanations for changes in homiciderates and provide reasonable certainty about whatworks. The specific content of the programs that merit testing is properly a matter for partnerships andnegotiations between local communities andthe Federal Government. Many programs havealready been found effective against some crimes,including early-infancy home visits and one kind of mentoring (Crime Prevention Effectiveness Program, ongoing research). But few programshave been tested using decreased gun violence asthe primary measure of program success. The Bos-ton and Kansas City gun program evaluations haveproduced the most encouraging case study results to date, but they urgently need large-scale testing (Crime Prevention Effectiveness Program, ongoingresearch). Unless these programs are tested in asystematic fashion, we will continue to see thehomicide rates of inner-city poverty areas riseabove the national average like the Rockies rise above the prairie.References COSSA Washington Update , Consortium of Social Science Associations, December 1997.

Greene Communities and Crime: An Overview The relationship between crime and disorder in community settings is complicated by many factors, including land use (e.g., residential, commercial, in- dustrial), population and residential density, housingstock age and infrastructure, the local economy, andlocal social ethos. These factors conspire in manyways to either stabilize or destabilize communities.The lack of community stability has for many years been associated with crime and delinquency. In recent years, communities have increasingly become the targets for criminal justice interven-tions, particularly those of the police. Nationalprograms aimed at \"weeding and seeding\" as wellas youth firearms prevention have included \"the community\" in the conception and resolution of neighborhood crime and disorder. In addition,community- and problem-oriented policing havesought, among many things, to recontextualize thepolice\u2014putting them in closer proximity to resi-dential communities and local social and economic institutions, building more effective alliances between the police and the public (both residentialand business), and solving persistent and complexcommunity crime and disorder problems (seeKelling and Coles, 1997; Hope, 1995). Cumula-tively these efforts, it ishoped, will help stabilize communities, thereby making them less crime prone and more resistant tocriminal invasion. Destabilized communities are said to produce an environment of criminality, and result in an accel-eration in the exodus of local businesses andhomeowners. Moreover, destabilized communities such as residential neighborhoods are seen as places governed by fear and criminal victimization,furthering the spiral of decline, particularly in urbanareas (Skogan, 1990).While crime and disorder have always been seen to have a community attachment, historically much of the work of the police and the criminal justice system has focused on individuals and cases, notnecessarily on social aggregates of people in definedplaces. Moreover, while communities have long beena focus of criminological inquiry, much of the expla-nation of crime dynamics within community con- texts has not been \"actionable\" by criminal justice agencies. That is to say, while criminology has iden-tified several important indicators of the likelihoodand persistence of crime in communities, criminaljustice interventions are the least likely to addressthose indicators in any direct or systematic way. For example, neighborhood studies beginning with Shaw and McKay (1959) and continuing to the presentsuggest that concentrated poverty, ethnic heterogene-ity, and community or residential instability lead tosocial disorganization within communities. Socialdisorganization, in turn, has a linkage to delinquency, crime, and disorder, generally through the inability of the community to adequately define and supervisepublic community behaviors (see Taylor et al., 1984;Sampson and Groves, 1989). Refinements in the social disorganization thesis have caused many to investigate the linkage between crime and disorder and the following factors: pov- erty, inequality, community mobility, the ethnic andracial composition of communities, family structure,and the density and types of housing within commu-nities (see Sampson, 1995, for an extensive reviewof this literature). While some agreement exists that these factors dramatically shape and account for community crime patterns as well as the differencesin crime rates across communities, the justice systemcontinues to have little opportunity to directly affectthese community crime factors. Several other gov-ernment agencies, however, particularly those associ- ated with education, housing, job training, family support, and health care, do impact on the factorsCommunities and Crime: Reflections on Strategies for Crime Control 46 \u00e4 \u00e4that shape both the level of community crime and disorder and, perhaps more importantly, the ability ofthe community to fend off criminal behaviors. Link-ing the capacities of various government and localagencies in the strengthening of local communitiesshould become a central theme in community crime prevention efforts. Community social disorganization essentially refers to the inability of any particular community toeffectively maintain social control or to establishshared values (Sampson and Groves, 1989; Bursik,1988; Bursik and Grasmick, 1993). Social disorga- nization theory assumes that communities, when functioning as social aggregates with shared valuesand regularized patterns of interaction, exerciseconsiderable social control through networks oflocal, informal relationships. These local networksand affiliations provide clout for the community to sanction inappropriate behavior, while at the same time socializing those within the community toaccepted community norms. Although communitieshave historically been defined in terms of theirgeography, many define them in terms of theirability to build and sustain networks. The social disorganization perspective also argues that neighborhood decay not only reduces the hori-zontal bonds between neighbors within communi-ties but also reduces the vertical linkages betweencommunities and larger political, social, and eco-nomic institutions. These linkages are essential if communities are to defend themselves; that is, muster the political, economic, and social resourcesto stem criminal activity. The Use of \"Community\" as an Organizing Framework To some extent the criminal justice system has been in a quandary over the importance of communitiesin the control of crime. This quandary stems in part from oftentimes conflicting research findings about the effect of justice system interventions on crimeand disorder, as well as from the shifting focus ofcrime prevention efforts\u2014from offenders to victimsto communities. Historically, the justice system has linked crime with individuals\u2014either those who commit crime or those who are the victims of crime. Many policetactics have sought to address types of offenders or victims. So too have prosecutorial and court inter-ventions sought to isolate repeat offenders from thecommunity. But until recently, the community hashad a passive role in crime prevention and ordermaintenance work. Although we often do not see it directly as such, effective crime prevention is about building and sustaining relationships in communitysettings. The presence or absence of relationshipswithin neighborhoods and communities has beensuggested as greatly affecting disorder and crime.Strengthening the community's involvement in and capacity to sustain local crime prevention efforts should become a central goal of any communitycrime prevention initiative. As previously indicated, much of the study of crime has concentrated on offenders and victims; that is,the people who are either involved in or affected by crime (Clarke, 1980). In recent years, there has been a shift in focus from people to places in theexplanation and prevention of crime\u2014at leastcertain types of crime. This shift is built on a recog-nition that crime is not equally distributed withincities and that criminals make decisions about where their crimes will take place. The idea of \"social structure\" is fundamental to the study of people in places. Social structure es-sentially refers to the regularized pattern of socialinteraction occurring among people in any givenplace and the values and/or beliefs that people at- tach to these interactions. Social structure accounts for both the interactional nature of human relationsand the social psychology of these interactions\u2014or their meaning to the people engaged in suchinteractions. The idea of \"place\" has a significant role in under- standing human behavior. People are inextricably linked to places. They have identities with theirhomes and families, their neighborhoods, and theircommunities. In a word, they have an environmentwithin which they take cues and direct their behav-ior. At the same time, people direct their behavior toward the environment, ultimately reshaping it through continual person-environment-person inter-action. How we use space, how we identify spatialissues, and how we build primary and secondarysocial networks, in part on the basis of place, areimportant to understanding the design of criminalJack R. Greene 47\u00e4\u00e4justice and other community support interventions. Such understanding helps to identify who belongs,who has ownership of the neighborhood, and whois likely to support police and other social controls. Focusing the Federal Role in Community Crime Prevention The Federal Government plays a potentially signifi- cant role in shaping State and local crime preven- tion policies, first and foremost by setting the tone of the discussion about community crime preven-tion and then by setting evaluation standards anda funding agenda for State and local programs toparticipate in such efforts. These three activities\u2014shaping a clearer agenda, setting standards for program assessment, and providing funding \u2014are consistent with the historic role the Federal Govern-ment has played in addressing domestic issues,although this role has been significantly diminishedby the agency-centered approach to policymakingand funding that has long dominated the Federal process. Shaping the agenda in community crime prevention is a critical role for the Federal Government, as itsets the general tone of the process by identifyinggoals, objectives, and outcomes as well as a rangeof potential interventions. At times the tone set by the Federal Government in the crime prevention discussion has been less clear in the messages sent.This circumstance is created largely by differencesin the ideological approach adopted by many inthe justice debate, coupled with a Federal agencyfocus that has been client and not problem oriented. While it will likely be more difficult to address con- flicts in the ideological premises undergirding thejustice debate, the agency focus issue is much moreactionable. Historically, there has been a significant tension in the way the justice debate has occurred. Two major positions appear to have been drawn from this discussion. First, there are those who see the debatecentered around issues of the root causes of crime,such as the macrolevel social structure, distributionof wealth, employment opportunities, and decay inthe American family and social values. The second position suggests that we should first control the streets before we worry about the root causes ofcrime (Wilson, 1995). In some respects, the formerargument is about long-term change (or its potential), while the latter approach is more pragmatic andfocused on current problems. In recent years, themore pragmatic of these approaches has capturedpublic attention. While many of these approacheshave included some attachment to larger social, eco- nomic, and structural forces shaping crime in local communities, by and large these programs have beenenforcement and not prevention focused. In the current climate, the Federal Government can play a significant role in furthering crime preven-tion in communities by placing crime prevention within a wider arena and more directly linking government agencies that impact on communityquality-of-life issues. Those at the Federal level canalso broaden the approach to enforcement and pros-ecution to include a greater focus on prevention. Such an approach will require that we focus not on offenders, victims, and crimes exclusively but also on children, families, and communities, providinginterventions that strengthen individual and collec-tive capacity to resist criminal behavior. One stepalong this path would be creating a policy forumwithin the Federal agency system that better links justice, housing, education, and health and human services capacities within the Federal Governmentto address issues of strengthening families andcommunities. While Federal agencies currently have overlapping responsibility for community crime prevention either through improved education, housing, child care, or social welfare policies (as well as throughthe actions of the criminal justice system), much ofthe crime debate is agency or topic centered, rely-ing far too much on the justice system as the sourceof intervention. That is to say, policies developed in education, public housing, urban development, or health and human services, to name a few, havea great potential to have an impact on communitysafety, although they are not necessarily designedor articulated with such goals in mind. Forexample, Federal agency policies affecting the availability of day care, preschools, and health care for children and their families are important influ-ences on a family's ability to participate in commu-nity life because they build local support networksand help to develop a community ethic governingprosocial behavior. Similarly, policies shaping theCommunities and Crime: Reflections on Strategies for Crime Control 48 \u00e4 \u00e4concentration of poverty in neighborhoods and the rebuilding of urban communities also significantlyaffect the ability of those neighborhoods to providesocial control and link with others in local areas tostem criminal behavior. Educational policies thatseek to create safer schools are significant in link- ing this process to safe neighborhoods, communi- ties, and families. Despite these linkages, at presentthe forum for such a discussion and policy coordi-nation is at best fragmentary. Since crime is a prob-lem that destabilizes families, communities, andlarger cities, creating a forum for the coordination of Federal programs and objectives seems an important shift from client- to problem-specificcommunity-based programming. Until such a policy forum is created, specific Federal agencies can craft policies for multiple pur-poses. For example, policies that promote neigh- borhood stabilization through housing and public assistance and efforts aimed at deconcentratingpoverty and dependence strengthen neighborhoodsand ultimately impact on criminal behavior. Forthis reason, policies supporting communities, fami-lies, and children need to integrate crime preven- tion as one of their intended outcomes rather than as a latent effect. Integration of crime preventioninto a wide range of Federal programs affectingcommunity quality of life will require that someagreed-upon goals be established so that agenciescan design policies to achieve those goals while at the same time monitoring their attainment. Designing an assessment framework and providing funding opportunities follow the creation of anexpanded definition of Federal agency involvementin crime prevention. Currently, there is a wide arrayof funding possibilities for the myriad of problems that confront communities. Each has differing objectives and outcomes, and in some cases theyactually compete for the same clients\u2014defined asindividuals, families, and communities. Outcomessought for these programs should include concernfor how they strengthen local communities and build social capital (Coleman, 1990). In this regard, with discrete programs in education, health and hu-man services, housing and urban development, andthe like, assessing community and family cohesionand stability and then measuring change in thoseconditions resulting from these programs are neces- sary steps in building better links among theseagencies. All too often, local client-specific agen- cies are unaware of programs offered by Federalagencies that may have an impact on their needsor even of those other local programs designed towork in the same community. At present, there isa patchwork of Federal, State, and local efforts\u2014 often in the same community and with little cross specification, evaluation, and communication. Finally, Federal agencies addressing community crime issues need to be more directly linked withthose of State and local governments, particularlyas projects unfold in local communities. Over the past several years, oversight boards or manage- ment processes emphasizing Federal, State, andlocal involvement in program design, implementa- tion, and monitoring have become more evident. Their coordination is often quite complicated.Nevertheless, requiring such interactions as part of program delivery, monitoring, and reporting can go a long way toward reducing some of theoperational barriers that occur between Federal,State, and local agencies addressing aspects ofcommunity crime prevention. Enhancing the State Role in Coordi- nating Community Crime Prevention State governments also play a potentially signifi- cant role in community crime prevention, primarily in the ways State resources are brought to bear onlocal crime problems: through the coordinationof State services with local government servicesand through the integration of differing levels ofjurisdiction, often complicating the integration of justice services. For example, typically, police and prosecutorial services are provided locally(in municipalities and, to some extent, counties),probation and juvenile services are provided by thecounty together with local jails, and correctionalservices are generally supervised by State govern- ments. The judiciary typically spans all levels of government, further complicating the administra-tion of justice in communities. A primary role for State governments, then, might be to focus on integrating services in areas targeted forcrime intervention while at the same time linking State and county correctional and probation policies and enforcement practices with local police andcommunity-based intervention efforts. Moreover,Jack R. Greene 49\u00e4\u00e4State governments must hold State agencies account- able for their impact on localities, not just on aggre-gated statistics for the State. At the same time, Stategovernments should actively encourage and supportlocal initiatives for rebuilding communities andsupporting families and children. Broadening the Role of Local Governments to RebuildCommunity Order and Safety Local governments are charged with creating a safe and secure environment within which communityresidents and local businesses work, reside, andrecreate. Such a responsibility requires that localgovernments refocus the efforts of their police toidentify and address community hot spots of crime. A better understanding of the spatial and territorial nature of crime has led to better police interven-tions. Over the past several years, important crimi-nological literature has emerged that postulates thatthe routine activities in any location and the rationalchoices made by reasoning criminals greatly affect the level of crime in that place. According to the routine activities and rational choice perspectives,crime and victimization occur through a naturalprocess in which individuals' work and leisure pat-terns create crime opportunities that are acted uponby discerning criminals. That is to say, the pattern and type of human activity (e.g., houses abandoned while people are at work, women walking alone,drunks, strangers) produce potential victims ortargets (unlocked cars, convenience stores, auto-mated teller machines), which reasoning criminalsobserve, assess, and make decisions about. These decisions are influenced by the routine activity as well as the physical environment in which the activ-ity takes place (Clarke, 1980; Clarke, 1995; Clarkeand Felson, 1993; Felson, 1986; 1987). Using these perspectives, the natural pattern of us- age of an area can be studied and choices made as to when places are under less surveillance and con- trol and therefore are more susceptible to criminalattack. These patterns and offender decisionmakinghave been well documented for burglary, drug of-fending, retail theft, and auto theft, among severalcrime types. If criminals can make such assess- ments and act on them, so too can the police, communities, and others attempting to increaselocal safety. Increasing guardianship for communi- ties is consistent with situational crime preventiontheories and practices. These and other studiesabout community crime prevention activities stressthe importance of understanding locations and ad-justing police and other responses to address prob- lems that may be concentrated in those locations. Hot spot analysis suggests that 3 percent of the places in Minneapolis accounted for 50 percent ofthe calls for police service, that no police cars weredispatched to 40 percent of Minneapolis addressesor intersections, and that the remaining intersec- tions and addresses each logged about one call for service per year (Sherman et al., 1989). In JerseyCity, a recent project to police drug hot spotsreported that 56 hot spots accounted for only4.4 percent of the street sections and intersectionsbut 86 percent of narcotics sales and arrests and 84 percent of emergency calls before the project was started (Weisburd and Green, 1995). In addition to identifying and addressing local crime hot spots, local governments need to focusthe efforts of all city agencies on solving commu-nity problems and integrating local services. This will require building local crime prevention coali- tions that can address local problems. Under the general rubric of \"community crime pre- vention\" (Hope, 1995), a wide range of programsaimed at strengthening social and institutional rela-tionships within communities have emerged, often directed by the police. Essentially, community crime prevention efforts have focused on rebuildingcommunities, particularly urban communities, thathave been greatly affected by changing social, eco-nomic, and political conditions. They have includedprograms aimed at organizing communities, im- proving citizen-police interactions, protecting the vulnerable, and changing the physical environment.They have included storefront police stations,Weed and Seed programs, police athletic leagues,and other youth intervention programs such asD.A.R.E. \u00ae and G.R.E.A.T., as well as community mobilizations for drug marches and neighborhood cleanups. More often than not, research assessingthese programs has concluded that they have failedto produce their intended results (Rosenbaum,1986), often because they were poorly implementedCommunities and Crime: Reflections on Strategies for Crime Control 50 \u00e4 \u00e4or did not involve significant agencies within cities that might have improved their impact. Such findings about the effects of community crime prevention programs have shifted attention from thebroad realm of communities to smaller areas evi-dencing high crime, particularly among youths (see Hope, 1995, for a discussion). By focusing on more discrete areas\u2014those with high crime rates amongyouths\u2014program specialists and researchers hope tosimultaneously address high crime offenders whilesupporting the victims and other community resi-dents within these areas. Such coordinated, place- bound strategies are continuing to emerge as part of community crime prevention efforts. Recent workcompleted in Boston showed a dramatic decrease infirearms usage among crime-prone youths, primarilydue to coordinated local interventions as well asrefinements in the definition of youths and handgun problems in that city (Kennedy et al., 1996). Finally, local governments need to continue to focus on infrastructure development in three impor-tant areas\u2014physical, social, and political. There isa significant amount of literature in criminologythat suggests that the level of physical and social incivility in any particular community is related to increased fear of crime (Wilson and Kelling, 1982;Skogan, 1990; Kelling and Coles, 1997). Thisline of reasoning suggests that communities canaffect crime and disorder by reclaiming publicspaces, reducing the signs of crime (graffiti, trash, drug paraphernalia), tightening up on the licensure of bars and liquor stores that habitually sell tominors or operate illegally, picketing or marchingagainst drug or prostitution locations, cleaning andsealing abandoned housing, and tagging and towingabandoned autos, among a wide array of commu- nity-based and often community-initiated activities. Strengthening and supporting local initiatives ofneighborhoods to reclaim their communities shouldbe part of any local government crime preventionagenda. Increasing the capacity of the communityfor local surveillance and prompt response to anti- social behaviors must also be part of this agenda. Addressing the physical and social incivilities evi- denced in any community is perhaps an easier taskthan building community political support or em-powering local community organizations to provideleadership for their community. Often, communitiesmost in need of intervention are least capable of defining and supervising community standards.Nonetheless, as Etzioni (1993) suggests, \"commu-nities themselves need some major fixing if theyare to provide the social foundation for a life that ismore cognizant of the values we all share.\" This is perhaps a major political dilemma requiring that we redefine individual, community, and governmentalrights, responsibilities, and actions. It will requirethat we reshape authority and accountability incommunities while at the same time reshaping howcore governmental services are provided. Some of this work is currently under way. Police, public health, and education systems have all built stron-ger community alliances over the past several years.This reinvention of government and reengineeringof services suggests that empowerment is a compli-cated process. Nonetheless, rebuilding local com- munity leadership is an important element of any community crime prevention effort.

Thisis a project, a type of open-ended problem-solvingproject, directed at serious youth violence in Bos-ton. Many of you may have heard this project de- scribed as a juvenile violence project. It wasn't. It was aimed initially not at legal juveniles but at vio-lence among young people. We started at the age of21 and moved that up, for reasons I will explain, toabout age 24 during the project. A lot of you willrecognize this as sort of the typical crack-and-gun curve of the last 15 years. Crack showed up in Boston in a major way in 1988. The city had itshomicide peak in 1990. Homicide rates in Bostondo not mirror rates in Chicago or Los Angeles, butour homicide rate jumped by nearly 50 percent in1990, totaling 150. The rate fluctuated for a year or two, and from 1992 to the present, remained stable at this historically elevated level. In the middle of1996 and into 1997, rates changed and the deathtoll in this 24-and-under age group dropped bytwo- thirds from the figures between 1988 and1995. These are not controlled experiments that I am going to be talking about; there is room for interpretation. But I think most people looking atthis curve would say that something happened in1996, which is what I am going to talk to you about. Elements of the Gun Project were also put in place in Minneapolis. So these are June through Novem- ber homicide series for all age groups. Minneapolis is one of a group of worrisome smaller cities thatseems to be experiencing a new round of crack andgang problems. The homicide rate doubled between1994 and 1995 and continued to go up. This inter-vention I am going to be talking about began in early June 1997, and it appears that something has happened there across all age groups.The Boston Gun Project There are two elements that comprise what we inBoston called the Ceasefire Initiative. One\u2014thiswas the inspiration for the Boston Gun Project andwhy it is called the Boston Gun Project\u2014is that thisis a gun problem, and there seemed to be an oppor-tunity to do something directly about the illegal acquisition of firearms. It was not gun control, tra- ditionally construed, but attention to what seemedlike a missed opportunity, focusing on the fact thatwhere young people and adult felons are concerned,gun acquisitions are already illegal. However thoseguns are acquired, it is a crime, and to the extent that new guns and used or stolen guns are being sold within these circles and on the street, that is acriminal enterprise. If you went to most local policedepartments and asked them about their burglarystrategy, their car theft strategy, or their prostitutionstrategy, they would have one. Some strategies might be good, some might be bad, but departments would have one. But if you asked them about guns,the response generally would be, \"Huh?\" One ofthe goals in the Gun Project is to try to change that. This is a profile of a gun trafficker. Boston has been tracing all of the firearms recovered by the police for the last 5 or 6 years. Generally, we trace guns only in support of particular investigations. We findthe smoking gun next to the body and no perpetra-tor, and we trace the gun to try to find out whomight have been the shooter. Finding the same situa-tion with somebody standing there, we don't trace the gun. Boston started tracing all of its guns, not to solve particular crimes but to try to figure out howthis illicit market in firearms might be working andwhether there was something that could be doneabout it. And, it turns out, there was. So these arereal guns, real gun stores, and real people. When you look at these traces, you find patterns.Crime Prevention as Crime Deterrence 56 \u00e4 \u00e4A number of guns used in crimes came from one gun store in Georgia. They were all bought by a handfulof first purchasers. This is information that theBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF)can give you when they trace guns. Anybody famil-iar with the street scene could see that these guns were the kinds of guns that are popular among gang members. And when we matched the possessorinformation\u2014that is, from whom the guns weretaken\u2014with the Boston Police Department informa-tion, it turned out that the majority of these individu-als were known Boston gang members. Something was wrong here. When this was investigated by ATF, what was wrong turned out to be that these purchas-ers were selling guns to two individuals who did notshow up anywhere, because they did not have theirnames on any of the paperwork. These two individu-als were taking guns up to Boston and selling them in the neighborhoods. Both of these guys are now in Federal prison. It turns out that this unapproachablegun market is actually not that unapproachable afterall. These relatively new guns turn out to be morepopular among gang members and youth offendersthan among older people. We still have many used and stolen guns floating around out there, and you are not going to find theproviders of those through traces. But the goodnews is, at some level, the people who know wherethose guns are coming from get arrested all the timebecause they are chronic, active, street offenders. The way you get the older and stolen guns is by talking with these offenders, the same way we havealways \"flipped\" narcotic offenders around narcot-ics. Police are now interviewing these guys aboutwhere their guns are coming from. They can leadyou to these providers of both the new guns and the old and stolen guns. Subsequent police work can put these guys out of business. So there is, in fact,a meaningful opportunity for doing somethingabout guns out there. Here is the second thing that quite unexpectedly came out of this problem-solving process. The Gun Project worked by convening a large group of front- line practitioners. We had police; probation; parole;local and Federal prosecutors; youth corrections;school police; and street workers, who in Boston dodirect outreach to gang members and at-risk youths.Later in the process, a number of other groups got involved. What all of them said at the outset wasthat this was a gang problem, that these are chronic offenders hurting one another: \"We know who theyare. When they get killed we know both the victimand the shooter.\" For various reasons, my Harvardteam was not enamored by this analysis. But wepursued it, and it turned out to be largely correct. And again, there are reams of research out of both Boston and Minneapolis on this. There were155 victims, 21 and under, between 1990 and 1995.Again, this is not Chicago or Los Angeles, but it isbad enough. When we ran criminal histories on each of these victims, we found that 55 percent had an arrest record in Massachusetts, about 20 percent had beenin either an adult or juvenile lockup facility beforethey were killed, more than 40 percent were onsome sort of probation at some time before theywere killed, and 15 percent were on active proba- tion supervision at the time they were killed. In addition, 25 percent of offenders committed murderwhile on probation. The offense counts were re-markable. Each of these groups, both offendersand victims, had an average of 10 or less offenses.About half of them had more than 10 offenses. And they were being arrested for all sorts of crimes. This is a classic concentration of offending. Crimi-nologically, the only new thing about this was thatit applied to this new population of young offend-ers. We always knew this about adults. Guided byour practitioner partners, we examined the gang problem in Boston. In Boston, these are small, fluid street groups. But they know who they are in thecommunity, and the authorities know who they are.We found 61 gangs, with about 1,300 members,total. In the summer of 1995 when we did thisanalysis, the Intervale Posse, which is a group in Roxbury, had an active dispute with the Big Head Boys, and a historical but at the moment quiescentdispute with the Castlegate and Fuller Street gangs.What our practitioners said, and our own subse-quent research showed, was that this was what wasgenerating most of the killing among young people in Boston. This was not primarily about drug business. It was mostly about respect and personalissues, very Hatfield and McCoy. It was vendetta-like, extended over time, sometimes extending toyounger siblings and friends. There were 1,300 kidsin total in these groups. That is less than 1 percent of their age group in the city, less than 3 percent inDavid Kennedy 57\u00e4\u00e4gang-troubled neighborhoods. There were 61 crews, and they were responsible, conserva-tively, for 60-70 percent of the youth homicide.This was a very focused problem. Once again, thisis classic criminal justice stuff. Matters turned outto be essentially the same in Minneapolis where we did similar analyses. So now we come to what changed in both of these cities, in Boston in thesummer of 1996 and in Minneapolis in June of1997. We told them to stop. That is what happened. When we think about crime control, we tend to think about prevention and criminal justice as sepa- rate enterprises, almost by definition. I think that is wrong. Prevention, in criminal justice, is deter-rence. It is the use of authority in the exercise ofchanging behavior. We would prefer not to use au-thority, but there are always individuals and groupsthat need authority. We have almost given up on the idea of actually creating deterrence in criminal justice. The Ceasefire strategy as it emerged wasan attempt to try to create meaningful deterrenceamong chronic offenders. It is an unusual strategythat makes different use of some routine tools. Thefirst unusual piece is to sit down with your target population\u2014in our case, these gangs\u2014and explain to them how the world is going to work. In mid-1996, there were formal meetings between thisworking group of authorities and Boston gangmembers. The authorities explained that they knewwho the gang members were and what they were doing. While the city would continue to pay close attention to all their offenses, the authoritiesstressed that there was now going to be a newregime where violence was concerned, and vio-lence-related offenses, such as carrying guns andfiring shots, would subsequently draw a unique response. The authorities told the gangs that they were informing them of their intentions becausenobody wanted to do any unnecessary enforcement.No one wanted to sweep the streets of these youths.But when these rules were broken, the interagencygroup would sit down, examine the groups in ques- tion, and figure out ways to reach out and touch them. A handout was given to Bowdoin Street gang mem- bers, a group called the Vamp Hill Kings, as part ofthe first structured Ceasefire crackdown. It simplystates, \"We said it and we meant it.\" Here is whathappened to the Kings, a gang that was killing each other from the inside out: There were threeintragang homicides within the Kings within avery short time in early 1996. The flier said that theauthorities that usually work separately now wereworking together and any information that one group had would be shared with the others. They indicated that these cooperative efforts were thereason that none of the Kings had been able to workthe corners (to sell drugs) and that the authoritieshad deliberately made the gang broke because oftheir violent behavior. They explained that this was why there had been such a heavy police presence in the gang's area doing what police know how todo: serving warrants, making street drug arrests,enforcing disorder laws, and talking to parents andneighbors. This was why those on probation orparole had been subject to stricter supervision. This was why a gang member who pulled a gun on a police officer in the course of the operation hadbeen given over to a Federal prosecutor rather thanthe county prosecutor and why the local prosecutorhad been giving priority to gang-related cases andopening old cases in which these gang members might have been involved. The message was that these efforts were being undertaken because of theviolence, that this was the way police and otherauthorities would do business henceforth. After the May meeting, most of the summer of 1996 was quiet. For a time, most of the Ceasefire interventions consisted of authorities reaching out to gangs that looked to be turning violent andexplaining, \"We are the guys who brought youBowdoin Street. If this goes any further, then youare next.\" This is what we started to think of as\"retail deterrence.\" Usually in criminal justice we would send these terribly broad messages. These were narrowly focused messages, and gangslistened. One group that did not attend was theIntervale Posse in Roxbury, and in late August1996, the core of this gang was arrested by theDrug Enforcement Administration (DEA) on Fed- eral drug charges. Once again the authorities went out on the streets and said, \"You are reading in the[Boston] Globe that this was a drug investigation,but it was a means to an end. They were warnedand they didn't listen. We did this because theywere being violent; now we are sitting back wait- ing. Who wants to be next?\"Crime Prevention as Crime Deterrence 58 \u00e4 \u00e4That was the last operation of anything on this scale as part of Ceasefire. The streets got quieterand quieter. These are not controlled experiments. It is going to be impossible to parse out exactly what went intothe interventions in Boston and Minneapolis. But it looks like something important is happening. Crime Control Implications I would like to talk about the crime control implica- tions of this approach. We are concerned aboutcrimes committed by chronic offenders: drugactivity, domestic violence, youth and adult homi-cide. It is well known that these serious crimes are embedded in patterns of chronic misbehavior. One can focus on any selected dimension of that chronicmisbehavior and influence it by imposing costsacross the other dimensions. Retail deterrence is,in theory, a strategic communication component,which makes it clear to the people you are dealing with that there are going to be consequences\u2014we call them \"pulling levers\" consequences, becauseyou \"pull levers\" to rapid costs, for example,by serving warrants\u2014around homicide, street drugmarkets, or other illegal activities. We had a large interagency group that was a power- ful tool. We brokered social services. We introduced kids to the Ten Point Coalition, a wonderful groupof activists and black clergy in Boston. The larger message was: \"We want the violence to stop. Wewill give you any help you need, but we are allstanding here together saying it stops today.\" Thatwas shoulder-to-shoulder communication. If youmake it very clear\u2014and we usually do not\u2014to these chronic offending populations what is going to draw a special kind of response and then have theorganization and surveillance to follow up on it,you can deliver a type of sanction with a swiftnessand predictability that appears to create compli-ance. Having done something similar to gun control to curb violence, you can move on to a second target. In Minneapolis, the conversation is abouta similar type of approach to control street drugactivity, which is that city's other big communityproblem. It is easy to imagine how you might dothis. Go to a bunch of crack houses and say, \"We are not going to tolerate this anymore. We have five DEA investigations ready to roll. We will de-ploy them to crack houses associated with violenceor generating a high level of community disorder.\"Over a period of 5 or 6 months, one could controlthose problems associated with crack dealing, even if one perhaps would not be able to shut down drug dealing citywide. I think this is a promising approach. We will see whether it can be applied to other types of crimeproblems.59\u00e4\u00e4Revitalizing Communities: Public Health Strategies for ViolencePrevention Deborah Prothrow-Stith As a public health professional, medical doctor, former Commissioner of Health of the Common-wealth of Massachusetts, and activist in the field ofadolescent violence, I am constantly aware of theheavy toll violence takes on our Nation's spirit,health, and economy. Violent injury, disability, and death consumes enormous health care resources and diminishes the quality of life of individuals,families, and communities. The United States has a problem with violence that is unlike any other country in the world. Our homi-cide rate for young men is eight times that of the developed country with the next highest rate, and 100 times that of the developed country with thelowest rate. 1 The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that 1.8 million people in the UnitedStates are victims of violence each year. Partnerand child abuse plague many of our homes. Schools, the place where young people spend a sig- nificant amount of time, are increasingly unable toprovide secure settings where learning can takeplace. Meanwhile, our media glorify violence. Weare tired of reading about it in the newspaper. Toomany people have suffered the tragic and senseless loss of a family member or friend to violence. If violence were inevitable\u2014just a part of the human condition\u2014then one would expect thehomicide rate to be relatively similar from countryto country. When I learned that our homicide ratewas so much higher than that of other countries, I was horrified and daunted. Later, I realized that these statistics also revealed an important truth:Violence is preventable. We do not need to havethis problem.Our public policy teaches us to view violence mainly as a criminal justice issue. People believethat building more prisons, lengthening prisonsentences, trying children in adult courts, andpreventing early parole are solutions. The criminaljustice system intervenes only after someone has committed an act of violence. We need solutions that prevent violence from happening in the firstplace. Public Health Strategies In 1985, then Surgeon General C. Everett Koopheld a landmark conference to address violence inthe United States as a public health problem. The conference ignited professional interest and sparked an array of activities throughout the last decade thatcontinues to grow and expand. Public health profes-sionals not only began using quantitative methodsto better understand violence and its risk factors,they also started developing a variety of prevention strategies. They have convened conferences; pro- duced reports; designed, implemented, and evalu-ated programs; and contributed to a growing publicawareness of violence prevention. Public health approaches to violence prevention are analogous to the prevention methods used to reduce lung cancer: primary prevention for the general population, secondary prevention for those athigher risk, and tertiary prevention or treatmentfor those with the disease. Though not perfect, theanalogy illustrates the three levels of prevention anddemonstrates the need for comprehensive efforts at all levels of risk.Revitalizing Communities: Public Health Strategies for Violence Prevention 60 \u00e4 \u00e4Primary lung cancer prevention programs create negative and offensive images of smoking usinghealth education and mass media campaigns.Primary violence prevention uses mass media mes-sages, classroom education, peer leadership andmediation, and community-based training programs to change social norms and attitudes. The goals are to redefine the \"hero\"; create alternative, problem-solving strategies; and reward and celebratenonviolent problem solving. Secondary prevention strategies are designed to help people at greater risk\u2014those who smoke\u2014 using behavior modification programs, counseling, or group therapy. Children at risk for violencerequire secondary prevention, including mentoring/nurturing programs, individual and group counsel-ing, \"in school\" suspension, and first-offenderprograms for court-involved youths. Children who witness violence or are victims of violence, two ofthe most defining risk factors, need specialized attention from professionals. With lung cancer, tertiary prevention is treatment\u2014 surgery or chemotherapy. With violence, it is medi-cal treatment and the criminal justice response\u2014arrest, prosecution, defense, incarceration, and rehabilitation. A campaign to reduce lung cancer that focused only on improving treatment wouldnot be successful; more surgery will not reducelung cancer rates. A successful campaign wouldhave to help those who smoke to stop and preventpeople from beginning to smoke by making it un- popular. The same is true with violence prevention; more severe punishment will not prevent violence. The magnitude and characteristics of violence- related problems cry out for new and creativeapproaches. The most effective programs must becomprehensive, family- and community-oriented, Exhibit 1.

Some schools, commu- nities, social service agencies, and politiciansaround the country have incorporated this formulafor success and developed strategies to helpchildren and their families prevent or cope withviolence. These programs offer the opportunity to learn from their successes and failures. The Boston Violence Preven- tion Movement: PromisingPrograms In many ways, Boston is the birthplace of the use of public health prevention strategies to address youthviolence. One of the major contributions of publichealth professionals is their focus on prevention,not intervention. In 1978, a precursor of the Vio- lence Prevention Curriculum for Adolescents 2 was taught in all 10th grade health classes at the BostonTechnical High School. In 1982, the Boston Pro-gram for High Risk Youth was started at BostonCity Hospital, 1 of 20 across the Nation funded bythe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation specifically to address adolescent health issues. Based on the curriculum, the Boston program focused on adoles-cent violence as a public health problem at theoutset. In 1986, the Boston Program for High RiskYouth became the Boston Violence Prevention Pro-gram and focused solely on applying public health techniques to violence prevention. 3 Over the years, a diverse and comprehensive set of strategies wereemployed. The basic strategy of the Boston Vio-lence Prevention Program is to train youth-servingprofessionals from many disciplines in the keyingredients needed to prevent youth violence and to provide technical assistance as they develop strate- gies to use in their respective agencies and work.The trainings focus on: lA \"can do\" or \"can prevent\" attitude that empha-sizes the instigation and escalation phases offights rather than aggressive responses to fights. lThe application of the same strategies used forsmoking, drunk driving, or teen pregnancyreduction to violence prevention. This analogyis helpful because many of those trained arealready working with teens on one of the threeissues.lA holistic approach to violence prevention thatnot only acknowledges the need for a transfor-mation of cultural attitudes and social norms butalso draws upon, is predicated upon, and encour-ages individuals to take responsibility for theiractions and the things they do to promote fight- ing and violence. The trainings use the Violence Prevention Curricu- lum for Adolescents, and the participants areencouraged to adapt the classroom activities anddiscussions to their specific programs (afterschool,peer leadership, theater groups, etc.). Spinoff activities, programs, and trainings are directly en- couraged and technical assistance is provided. Atrainee's clearly stated responsibility is to return tohis/her agency and design and implement violenceprevention strategies that could be integrated intohis/her agency program. The program was incorpo- rated into the city's Adolescent Wellness Program in 1994. After its use at the Boston Technical High School, The Violence Prevention Curriculum for Adoles-cents was developed in a Boston public high school, officially published in 1987 by the Education Development Center, and has sold more than 20,000 copies. It continues to be usedin several Boston schools and other youth-servingprograms. Two separate and recently publishedevaluations associate the use of the curriculum withdeclines in student suspension rates in two Boston public high schools as well as with behavior changes among students in Augusta, Georgia. 4,5 It is fair to estimate that over the years the BostonViolence Prevention Program trained several thou-sand professionals from Boston's schools, youthprograms, human service agencies, police and criminal justice organizations, religious institutions, business groups, recreation programs, and healthcenters and hospitals, as well as public housingresidents and teenagers. Boston is now the site ofnumerous violence prevention and peace promotionprograms, many of which emerged as direct spinoffs from the Boston Violence Prevention Program. Exhibit 1 illustrates the year of startupand the cumulative accomplishments of several ofthese programs. Some examples of these spinoffsare described below.Revitalizing Communities: Public Health Strategies for Violence Prevention 62 \u00e4 \u00e4lIn 1990, Boston City Hospital began a project of visiting and providing special violence preven-tion counseling to adolescents admitted to thehospital for gunshot and stab wounds. The pro-gram eventually grew to involve patients' friendsand family. A safety plan is developed for each patient and followup includes more than atten- tion to the physical wound. lCitizens for Safety was founded in 1990. It hasheld several gun buyback programs in conjunc-tion with the police and sponsored several neigh-borhood-based public policy initiatives. Its most recent campaign, \"Hands Without Guns,\" is headed by Michael MacDonald, a survivor ofviolence. This campaign is a middle-school-based initiative that promotes nonviolent optionsfor students, coordinates and promotes youthactivities, and develops mass media messages highlighting youth accomplishments. lIn 1990, Ulrich Johnson started a volunteer, anti-gang-violence teen peer leadership programcalled Teens Against Gang Violence that hasconsistently provided workshops for parents,schools, and community groups. lJoseph and Clementina Chery started the LouisD. Brown Peace Curriculum after their son waskilled in 1993. It is now used throughout theBoston public schools. lAnn Bishop, director of the school-based clinicat Brighton High School, has been teaching violence prevention to Boston teenagers for 12 years and runs a special initiative for studentswho have experienced or witnessed violence.Her students developed and produced a rap songon violence prevention. lPeter Stringham, a physician at East Boston Health Center, has been teaching his patients violence prevention strategies for several years.He has been providing parents with guidance ondiscipline practices and their arguing patterns asearly as the first well-baby visit. He also edu-cates other physicians on how to do the same. lIn 1992, Boston City Hospital initiated a specialprogram for children who witness violence, andthe Harvard Community Health Plan Foundationhas sponsored parent information brochures on television watching and disciplinary techniquesin addition to their \"Think\u2014Violence is forThose Who Don't\" campaign. WBZ-TV's(Boston's CBS affiliate) Stop the Violence Cam-paign is 4 years old and represents a concerted media blitz with measurable impact on public policy and funding for domestic violenceinitiatives. Numerous other programs have been established over the past decade, including Gang Peace, theLiving After Murder Program of the Roxbury Comprehensive Health Center, the peer leadership programs at local health centers, and the teen peertheater and education group We Educate!\u2014ATouch of Class (W.E.A.T.O.C.). The list also in-cludes several new initiatives such as the national\"Squash It\" campaign, which focuses on using the media to make it acceptable to walk away from fights. Other national initiatives that have comple-mented efforts in Boston include the Children'sDefense Fund's Safe Start Initiative; efforts by theCenter to Prevent Handgun Violence, the AmericanMedical Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics; and several publicly funded programs from the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion, the National Institute of Justice, and the U.S.Department of Education. Other programs such as those addressing economic development and homeownership in Boston's poor neighborhoods must also be considered. As a result of consistent activism and advocacy, in Massachu-setts home mortgage lending to all minority bor-rowers increased to 33 percent between 1993 and1995, outpacing the national average. And withinBoston, multifamily mortgage originations increased nearly 40 percent during those years. 6 Conclusion The Boston violence prevention movement has involved a determined, coordinated, multidimen-sional, and lasting campaign across agencies, disci-plines, and institutions. There are many promisingprograms that are having an impact in the Boston community and are being celebrated nationally. Such programs require ongoing support andcommitment.Deborah Prothrow-Stith 63\u00e4\u00e4The contributions made by public health profes- sionals toward efforts to prevent violence have beentremendous. The continued application of publichealth strategies to the understanding and preven-tion of violence assures success. The public healthcampaign to reduce smoking took 30 years after the first Surgeon General's report to reduce smoking. Violence reduction can be expected to take at leastas long and will require as many, if not more,diverse strategies. Notes 1.

Tough Meets Love:Promising Approaches toNeighborhood Safety, CommunityRevitalization, and Crime Control Roger L. Conner The purpose of this session is to identify promising programs and approaches that can enhance the Fed-eral Government's efforts to decrease crime andrevitalize communities. For the past 8 years, I have served as Executive Director of the Center for the Community Interest (CCI) in Washington, D.C. CCI does research, public education, and advocacy for civic associations andneighborhood groups on crime and quality-of-lifeissues. One of our primary objectives is to keep theinnovative grassroots activists and local governmentofficials out of trouble with the courts. We also main- tain a clearinghouse on legal challenges to strategies that improve the quality of life in urban neighbor-hoods and business districts, and we go to courtwhenever balanced, effective strategies come underlegal attack. As you might expect, local leaders on crime and quality-of-life issues are in touch with us a great deal. I could fill the entire conference agenda witha list of the promising programs that have comeacross my desk in the past couple of years, becausethere is an enormous effort under way in neighbor-hoods and communities across this country. I would like to highlight four clusters of promising approaches that should draw more attention andsupport at the Federal level. A New Role for Lawyers Almost 2 years ago, Jeremy Travis gave a talk inNew York entitled \"Lessons for the Criminal JusticeSystem From 20 Years of Policing Reform.\" In that talk, he offered a prediction (or, perhaps, what hehoped would be a self-fulfilling prophecy): Thatother elements of the criminal justice system willstart looking over the fence at the progress beingmade by their policing brethren and import the lessons into their own territory. He postulated \"three essential lessons from the development ofcommunity policing that can be applied to the restof the criminal justice system\": lView the community as a full partner. lFocus on solving the problems that matter to the community. lPay attention to little things.1 As a lawyer, I feared that my colleagues would be the last to look to the blue-collar workers of thejustice system for guidance. The inner momentumof the law is enormous, as is its resistance to change. However, I am glad to report that a growing number of attorneys working in and in association withthe criminal justice system are developing a newapproach to their work that draws on the lessons ofcommunity policing. There are enough of them, andtheir work is so distinctive, we can now say that a new kind of practice, a new legal specialty, is emerg- ing. Jeremy Travis has suggested a name for thespecialty: Community Safety Law. I hope thatcommunity safety law (CSL) will eventually takeits place alongside environmental law, securities law,and communications law as a recognized specialty.Promising Approaches to Neighborhood Safety 66 \u00e4 \u00e4Briefly, CSL practitioners are attorneys who take a direct, working interest in the public safetyproblems of particular places. Right now, they'rea diverse and scattered body\u2014some employed as\"community prosecutors,\" some as city attorneysor solicitors, some engaged in delivery of legal services to the poor through nonprofit organiza- tions, some working for nonprofit \"public interestlaw firms,\" and some in private practice. At thistime they have few opportunities to network, shareinformation, recognize one another's achieve-ments, or gain a clear sense of themselves as a distinct group. But insofar as there is a community justice movement\u2014one that is gradually openingup the criminal justice system to popular collabo-ration and reorienting it in the direction of practi-cal problem solving\u2014these are the men andwomen who are defining what it means to be a lawyer in this new paradigm. The common public perception of the lawyer's role in the criminal justice system is straightforward: toprocess cases efficiently and uniformly and maxi-mize convictions (or defend against prosecution).CSL lawyers do not fit comfortably into this mold. They take a direct, active role in the provision of public safety in the communities where they work,and not primarily by processing criminal cases.Some have nothing whatever to do with caseprocessing; others are not even prosecutors. A fewillustrations will serve to suggest how far from the conventional CSL model practitioners are straying: lThe Community Law Center, a nonprofit commu- nity legal services agency in Baltimore, hasbecome so deeply involved in drug nuisanceabatement; vacant housing receivership actions;direct enforcement of housing, building, health, and zoning codes; and other \"purely civil\" efforts to fight crime and disorder on behalf of the neigh-borhood groups it serves that it now operates itsown anonymous tipline for crime reporting. lA \"Neighborhood District Attorney\" in Portland,Oregon, brokered a \"partnership agreement\" between local police and operators of motels suspected of conniving at prostitution and drugdealing on their premises, granting the operatorsspecial services (extra patrols, prompt trespassenforcement) in exchange for their takingmeasures to safeguard against criminal use of their rooms (screening guests, accepting onlycertain types of identification, requiring visitorregistration, granting police access to registrationrecords). lA former homicide trial lawyer in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, now stationed in a police district as part of acommunity prosecution pilot project, quicklydiscovered that: (1) local residents wanted some-thing done about nuisance properties in the area,especially abandoned buildings being used by local drug dealers and users, and (2) local agen- cies were not inclined to help. So she made avideo. That is, she went out with a police officer,a housing inspector, and a camera to put togethera video tour of the area's 30 worst abandonedproperties. The footage she came up with was dramatic and eye-opening\u2014at one point, on camera, a quantity of heroin was actually discov-ered in a chimney\u2014and resulted in public andmedia pressure that eventually prodded theresponsible agencies to act. Abstracting from these and many other examples of CSL work undertaken to date, it is possible to isolate six basic features that both distinguish CSLfrom traditional criminal practice and serve todefine it as a distinct legal specialty. 1.The unit of work is different. In the traditional model, the basic unit of work is the criminal case, which is \"delivered\" to the prosecutor by way of a police investigation/arrest and thereafter\"handled\" in various ways until eventually\"disposed of.\" The individual case may or maynot be related to a broader public safety problemin the community from which it arose, and the handling of the case may or may not have some impact on the broader problem. But either way,the attorneys (both prosecutor and defense)literally take things \"one case at a time.\" Portland's Neighborhood District Attorneys rarely even handle cases. However, most com- munity prosecutors have conventional case- processing responsibilities and work at seeingpast individual cases. Ronnie Earle, long-timehead of the Travis County District Attorney'sOffice in Austin, Texas, \"look[s] at crime as anRoger L. Conner 67\u00e4\u00e4opportunity to intervene, to solve the problem that led to the crime in the first place.\" 2.The source of the work is different. It follows from the distinction described above, betweencases and problems as units of work, thattraditional and CSL attorneys get their work in different ways. For traditional case-processing prosecutors or defense attorneys, \"intake\" isfairly simple. They need not be entirely passive inaccepting casework\u2014they may lead or influenceinvestigations, confer closely with police beforearrests are made or warrants issued, screen out some cases altogether and assign varying priori- ties to others\u2014but their casework will arriveregularly whatever they do. Most lawyers servingthe poor in legal services or nonprofit organiza-tions also have their priorities driven by thewalk-in cases, and collective action tends to be for the purpose of addressing a collection of individual rights against landlords, businesses,or governmental agencies. A CSL practitioner, on the other hand, must go out and look for problems. Several of the practi- tioners I have met spend a significant amount of their worktime doing what can only be described as mixing: attending neighborhood association meetings, participating in marches, dropping inon community-based social service providers,even lending a hand to church groups that needhelp with flier distribution and other routine tasks. One practitioner laughingly calls it \"unskilled labor\"\u2014and yet cultivating andmaintaining these contacts with the communitycould not be more essential to her work. Withoutthem, she would have no way of knowing whatwork there was to do. 3.The connection with the \"client\" is different. Traditional case processors naturally focuson what matters to their work\u2014the individualdefendants, witnesses, and victims whose actionsalone have significance as part of the drama ofthe criminal case; the \"law-abiding community\" is at most a vague backdrop, a rhetorical device for summations, an abstraction well to the rear. In contrast, the CSL practitioner has something more like a lawyer-client relationship with the community: direct, intimate, face-to-face. Thedifference, particularly for prosecutors, may have something to do with physical location:respondents in community-prosecutor positionsrepeatedly (and apparently unconsciously) usephysical-spatial terminology conventional pros- ecutors \"downtown.\" CSL prosecutors are not merely physically removed from the center\u2014and incidentally isolated from the conventionalprosecutorial subculture, with its peculiar preoc-cupations, status rivalries, and assumptions aboutthe world. Their responsibilities now cover a much smaller part of the whole. Even the part of a CSL practitioner's work that concerns individual case handling is affectedby this more intimate lawyer-client relationship.Because of their many contacts with localpeople\u2014at block meetings, ward meetings, patrol service area meetings, church meetings, even informal \"walk-along\" meetings withvolunteers in citizen patrols\u2014they are muchmore knowledgeable about the human context inwhich crimes occur than a traditional prosecutorcould be. A case screener with a CSL orientation will tend to \"know the problems,\" Stephanie Miller says, and\"who the players are.\" She ismuch more likely to \"call around\" to dig upbackground before making a screening decision,and much less likely to \"work in the dark.\" So,for example, trespass, unlawful entry, and other \"insignificant\" offenses will get her attention in certain cases, where they would not have before,because she understands their importance to real,flesh-and-blood people. For some CSL attorneys, the community\u2014at least in the form of a community group and its elected leaders\u2014is literally the client. When the firm of Davis, Polk, and Wardwell in New Yorkintervened for a local public housing tenants'group in a court case challenging a new speedydrug-eviction policy, they did it for the samestraightforward reason that most lawyers do most legal work: because that's what their clients wanted them to do. The same was true of attorneys with the Community Organizations Legal AssistanceProject (COLAP) in Indianapolis, who, on be-half of neighborhood associations, communityPromising Approaches to Neighborhood Safety 68 \u00e4 \u00e4development corporations, and other representa- tive groups, hammered out a comprehensivememorandum of understanding with variouscity and county agencies outlining a step-by-step plan for eradicating drug markets in sevencity neighborhoods. Anne Blumenberg, Executive Director of the Com- munity Law Center (CLC) in Baltimore, estimatesthat about 15 percent of the work CLC staff attor-neys do for the community organizations that makeup their clientele concerns straight corporate, tax,and transactional matters, but, since these organiza- tions are based in \"some of the worst crime and drug areas in the city,\" the remaining 85 percent ofthe work they need done is pure CSL. 4.The priorities are different. Traditional case processors, typically remote from neighborhood-level concerns and accustomed to dealing with each criminal case in isolation from its neighbor- hood context, naturally tend to prioritize casesaccording to their abstract \"seriousness,\" withmajor felonies at the top and many common,street-level offenses beneath notice. One CSLpractitioner calls this the \"reactive, episodic\" approach to strategic and resource-allocation decisions in which individual crimes are consid-ered \"without examining the landscape of thecriminal cases or the impact of cases tried on thecommunity.\" She is now studying her office withan eye toward moving Federal prosecutors away from this traditional, \"case-by-case\" view to get them to take into account the connections amongcases and between cases and problems. But sheadmits it will be a \"daunting task.\" For the tradi-tional prosecutor, the equation is \"serious\" problems are by defini- tion its \"serious\" crimes and vice versa; to find out what these are, you simply \"run the stats.\" CSL lawyers experience a total shift in their thinking. From assuming that only \"big felonies\"matter and that a neighborhood with, forexample, a lot of armed robberies could not possibly be concerned about vandalism or pan- handling, they typically discover that it is themisdemeanors and noncriminal infractions thatcause the most concern. These are the verymatters that are allocated few resources in thecriminal justice system. The \"offenders\" are notthe kind of people you can \"put away,\" even hypothetically. And yet, at a neighborhood meet-ing, they are all residents want to talk about. 5.The tools are different. A traditional prosecutor has, in essence, two tools to work with: criminalprosecution and the threat of criminal prosecu- tion. The traditional legal services lawyer functions as an adversary of landlords, housingagencies, cities, and even the police to protectthe individual rights of low-income people bydefending them in litigation. This is so evenwhere the individual who obtains legal assistance is actually part of the problem for the surround- ing neighborhood. CSL attorneys have manyadditional, unconventional tools to choose from,including the following: lCommunity consultation and mobilization.CSL practitioners invariably address localized public safety problems by enlisting the creativ- ity, support, and energy of local residentsthemselves. All of the CSL practitioners I havemet and talked with report that frequent consul-tation with residents is central to their jobs\u2014for purposes of both problem definition and problem solving. So, for example, Neighbor- hood District Attorney Wayne Pearson learnedearly on from residents of Portland's LloydDistrict that many of their low-level disorderproblems\u2014public intoxication, littering,vandalism, petty theft, etc.\u2014emanated from a growing population of transients illegally camping in a nearby gulch. The solution:Once it was cleaned, cleared, and posted with\"no camping\" signs, voluntary resident-patrolsmonitored the gulch for signs of newencampments. The Community Law Center in Baltimore has been intimately involved with communitygroups in developing training for communitymobilization against drug markets and writinglegislation that simplifies civil actions againstlandowners. Legal Services in Kansas City, Missouri, has written new laws to clear titles to abandoned properties to speed them into thehands of community development corporations. lFocused education. A large part of CSL work involves formal and informal teaching. OneRoger L. Conner 69\u00e4\u00e4community prosecutor conducts special presentations to educate prosecutors workingin the local municipal courts, public housingmanagers, and special deputies handlingsecurity in large housing complexes on howto make trespass laws stick. Baltimore's Com- munity Law Center has produced a book on how to use civil remedies to deal with prob-lem properties. The law firm of Cadwalader,Wickersham & Taft wrote a 350-page bookon civil remedies and how they could beimproved in New York State. lInteragency collaboration. Ronnie Earle, Travis County, Texas, District Attorney andoutspoken proponent of what he calls \"commu-nity justice,\" reports that his office is engagedin 25 different collaborations, task forces, andworking groups with local nonprosecutorial agencies, ranging from those in which the office takes a leading role to those in whichstaff members sit on boards. The \"conveningpower\" of the DA's office\u2014basically, thepower to cut across traditional bureaucraticbarriers to focus the whole community's ener- gies on a public safety problem\u2014is perhaps best exemplified by Travis County's \"Neigh-borhood Conference Committees,\" in whichlocal school, police, juvenile court, and healthand human services officials as well as privatecitizens came together under the sponsorship of the DA's office to form an elaborate alternative sanctions system for juvenile first offenders. lPartnerships with police. Attorneys under Robert Messner, who heads the Civil Enforce-ment Unit of the Legal Bureau of the NewYork City Police Department, work with police to target stolen-auto \"chop shops,\" unlicensed social clubs, prostitution and drug-dealing fronts, and other illegal businesses,using civil nuisance abatement and forfeitureprocedures rather than traditional criminalprosecutions to shut them down. According to Messner, because of the sophisticated organi- zation of these businesses as well as the intri-cacy of the law in this area\u2014the body of lawsand regulations pertaining to auto-dismantlingchop shops is \"more complex than the taxcode\"\u2014police continuously need to consult with lawyers to have any impact.lCivil and administrative remedies. The Com- munity Law Center in Baltimore has no powerto prosecute criminals, and yet it has madeitself into a formidable force against \"crimeand grime\" in the neighborhoods in which itoperates\u2014primarily through an aggressive program of \"private\" code enforcement and nuisance abatement litigation. As legal coun-sel for community organizations with broad,welfare-promoting purposes, the Center fileshundreds of actions each year to enjoin drugtrafficking in neighborhood properties, force landlords to take security measures against criminals, and compel property owners torehabilitate buildings or turn them over tononprofit receivers for renovation and resale.In fact, the Center has gone so far in thisdirection that it now sees itself at the forefront of a movement toward what is called \"the coproduction model\" for the delivery of gov-ernment services\u2014in which private citizensand their voluntary organizations \"coproduce\"as well as \"consume\" traditional governmentservices. The Los Angeles County Prosecutors Office, in cooperation with the local law firm ofLatham & Watkins, was the first to file civilsuits to have specific gangs declared a \"publicnuisance.\" The resulting injunctions have dra-matically altered the quality of life in South- ern California neighborhoods that had been terrorized by gangs for many years. OtherCalifornia jurisdictions have implemented thesame approach, which was recently approvedby the California Supreme Court. lCSL innovations. There is \"no form book\" for CSL attorneys. As one neighborhood DA put it: \"The community wants a solution. You'rea lawyer. Go find it.\" There is a sense of free-dom from traditional assumptions and arbi-trary limits in the work that all CSL lawyershave in common. 6. The definition of success is different. A tradi- tional case processor's definition of success ismore or less dictated by the nature of the work:Success is winning cases. There is, of course, atleast a theoretical relationship between winningcases and larger goals of public safety and justicePromising Approaches to Neighborhood Safety 70 \u00e4 \u00e4for the individual. It is not just a matter of winning for the sake of winning, but the fact remains that aconventional lawyer in the justice system has onlyone way of furthering those larger goals and can-not afford to concentrate on anything else. A CSL attorney\u2014anchored to a particular place, answerable to its residents, focused directly on its safety\u2014must have a definition of success that isat once more concrete and more complicated thanthis. Most actual public safety problems never\"go away\" in the way that even the most drawn-outcriminal cases eventually do: Success is a matter of maintaining a critical balance, first holding and then gaining ground, gradually increasing residents'confidence, but never actually winning the day.In a broad sense, CSL successes are always relatedto actual problem-solving improvements in publicsafety\u2014to better coordination, more community commitment and vigilance, and less fear. But the ideal CSL attorney would be a kind of all-purposefixer, like a beat cop who understands that the mostimportant part of the job is staying on the job. Many district attorneys, prosecuting attorneys, and U.S. Attorneys have always seen themselves as policymakers and problem solvers in addition to prosecutors of individual cases. Indeed, it was U.S.Attorney Michael Baylson of the Eastern District ofPennsylvania who invented the model that becamethe Weed and Seed program. If you think about theparallel to community policing, the chief and his or her top staff focused on problem solving even dur- ing the heyday of 911-driven policing. Communitypolicing pushed discretion and a problem-solvingorientation much deeper into the ranks. Similarly,the innovation we are seeing among lawyers ispushing the collaborative, problem-solving orienta- tion deeper into the ranks. Preparing the Community for Community Justice There is much talk around the U.S. Department of Justice these days about community justice. Thediscussion represents recognition, at the Federallevel, of a range of experiments introduced byinnovative, pragmatic leaders at the State and local levels. \"While the concept of community justice is still developing,\" Assistant Attorney General LaurieRobinson wrote in a February 1997 invitation letter to the community justice conference, \"two keyprinciples stand out ... making the community afull partner with agencies of the justice system topromote public safety and addressing the needs ofthe community and the victim through a problem- solving approach.\" The trouble is, it's hard to tango with someone who doesn't know how to dance. When I was incollege, there weren't any courses on organizingyour community to get rid of drugs or crime. Myhigh school civics course didn't cover how to keep block clubs going from one year to the next or the difference between community policing and 911-driven random patrol. Like me, most citizens haveno training, experience, or knowledge of how tobe more than passive cheerleaders for police andprosecutors. In a handful of jurisdictions, organizations have emerged to recruit, organize, and train citizens andserve as the local \"institutional memory\" on how tomake the justice system work for the community.The structure of such organizations is quite diverse.For example: New York. The Citizens Committee for New York City (CCNYC) provides training, technical assis-tance, small grants, and self-help literature formore than 11,000 block clubs in New York City. Italso operates formal training programs for neigh-borhood safety advocates, block club leaders, and youths. Although it deliberately avoids taking advocacy positions, CCNYC is the institutionalmemory for many past public safety volunteerefforts and a place for new activists to come andlearn what works. Chicago. Chicago has a number of organizations with public safety as their mission and full-time organizers and trainers on staff. The most promi-nent, the Chicago Alliance for Neighborhood Safety(CANS), at one time had a contract with the city toorganize and train citizens in every precinct in thecity on how to be \"coproducers of safety.\" The evaluation reports on their work are in: CANS orga- nized and trained citizens to understand problemsolving and work effectively with police as part-ners. The Northwest Austin Council is anotherChicago group that has had full-time organizers onRoger L. Conner 71\u00e4\u00e4staff for over a decade, and the difference between their neighborhood and others similarly situated isremarkable. Chicago now has a number of organiz-ers on staff, but whether they can match the inde-pendent citizens' groups in effectiveness has yet tobe determined. Baltimore. In Baltimore, the Community Planning and Housing Association (CPHA) has been an advo-cate for low-income neighborhoods for many years.It believes neighborhood safety is necessary forneighborhood development and stability. Moreimportant, they have created a \"train the trainers\" curriculum by which the original handful of inspira- tional leaders have passed on their knowledge to newstaff and new neighborhood activists. I understandthat the evaluation report from Baltimore's Compre-hensive Communities Program is giving significantcredit for the progress in the target neighborhoods to the trainers and organizers of CPHA. Fort Worth. The Citizens' Crime Commission of Tarrant County created a \"Community Leader-ship Development\" (CLD) program. CLD volunteersreceive a year of leadership training seminars similarto those offered to corporate or government middle managers. In exchange, they pledge to participate as members of their police precinct's Citizens AdvisoryCommittee, to team with city officials to addressproblems in their own neighborhoods, and to recruittheir own replacements after 1 year. Along withthis effort, the police department has recruited and trained 145 block and neighborhood groups (with 2,800 members) to patrol streets for code violations.The most visible crime problems (open-air drugmarkets and prostitution) were driven out by theirorganized presence. Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Crime Commis- sion is providing a year or more of intensive leadership training to citizens from specific neigh-borhoods (called State \"Weed and Seed\" sites).The idea is to strengthen the capacity of the com-munities by training leaders. Interestingly, thePennsylvania program selects a mixture of people who reside in the target area and who work there, because both residents and institutions need to getinvolved in meaningful solutions.Everyone seems to agree that having the commu- nity as a partner in safety and justice issues is agood idea. It is remarkable to me that formal, orga-nized training and technical assistance are recog-nized as a necessity for the justice professionals butas a luxury or an afterthought for the citizens who are being asked to be partners in implementing the new paradigm of community justice. Consider the success of community policing in Portland, Oregon. Much has been made of thepolice chief's leadership, and I do not discount it.However, Portland's 94 identifiable neighborhoods are supported by the full-time staff of the Office of Neighborhood Associations, and I suspect theyhave played a bigger role than we can see. Granted, we need to know a lot more about the creation and nurturing of such groups. Can the citygovernment or the police provide the training and organizers? Will the money be wasted if it goes to nonprofits? Is the \"support group\" model (CCNYC)better than the advocacy model (CANS)? However, I make this assertion on the basis of my own experience: Citizens will never be effectivepartners with the criminal justice system without institutionalized recruitment, training, and educa- tion. President Clinton once observed that 10,000effective community organizations could do morethan 100,000 police officers. If he is right, it is apity that there are untold resources for trainingpolice for community policing but none for training citizens. Addressing Disorder in Urban Centers andCommercial Districts Another cluster of promising programs that has emerged recently has to do with restoring securityand civility in the central business districts andolder commercial strips of our Nation's cities. If a trip to the downtown area or the neighborhood stores requires citizens to run a gauntlet of unpleas- ant encounters, people with options are going toleave. At CCI, we have received hundreds ofrequests for assistance over the past 2 years forPromising Approaches to Neighborhood Safety 72 \u00e4 \u00e4help dealing with aggressive panhandlers, homeless people who have set up encampments in publicparks, frightening and dangerous personsapparently afflicted with mental illness, and\"Deadheads\" sprawled across sidewalks nearuniversity districts. The problems to be overcome are both political and legal. No one wants to be, or to be seen as, hostile todestitute and homeless people who cannot care forthemselves, and the courts are not willing to givepolice broad discretion to force people to \"move on.\"The compromise that seems to be emerging in the interplay between courts and communities is that or- dinances that target specific antisocial conduct rather than broad categories of people will be accepted. Cities are saying that a tolerance for diversity is notinconsistent with reasonable standards of conductthat apply to everyone, and the courts, with some notable exceptions, are agreeing. Some of the newly adopted ordinances include:Panhandling controls. Total bans on panhandling have been rejected. When New York City attemptedto enforce an old law that banned loitering andpanhandling, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the ordinance as an infringement on the First Amendment. The same result occurred inMassachusetts. In contrast, the same courts haveconsistently held that \"reasonable time, place, andmanner\" regulation of panhandling is permissible.For example, bans on \"aggressive\" panhandling have been adopted in several cities and approved by Federal courts in Seattle, Atlanta, Santa Monica,and Dallas. But one Federal District Court in LosAngeles has recently ruled to the contrary, and anappeal is expected. Restrictions on locations where panhandling pre- sents special problems have also been approved, ranging from subways, airports, State fairgrounds,and post offices. To the extent that future judgesfollow their peers, panhandling bans in locationsthat are inherently provocative (near automaticteller machines) or crowded (beachfront board- walks) appear to be on firm constitutional footing. Again, however, a Southern California DistrictCourt judge recently went against this trend andthrew out a ban on panhandling at the Los AngelesInternational Airport.Some innovative area bans include: lLas Vegas put a huge, expensive glass canopy over the main central business district thorough-fare on which a light show is displayed hourlyeach night, then banned panhandling within\"The Freemont Street Experience.\" lA new Santa Monica law says panhandlers maynot be intoxicated and must not approach closerthan 3 feet from their targets. lThe City Council of Berkeley banned all panhan-dling at night as inherently threatening. Urban camping, public sleeping, and sidewalk obstruction. Ordinances that restrict public sleep- ing in specific places, such as the immediate sur-roundings of public buildings and monuments orheavily used urban parks, and that prohibit camping(the colonization of public spaces) thus far havebeen approved in every instance. The use of tres- pass laws to break up concentrations of people who set up encampments on public land has also beenapproved. However, where cities have attempted todefend depression-era laws banning public sleepingin all public places in a city, the record is mixed.Some courts agree with the theory that sleep is essential to life and thus have ruled that it violates due process if, in fact, there are persons with noplace to sleep on private or public property in anentire community. Seattle and other jurisdictions have also banned people from sitting or lying on sidewalks in busi- ness districts during business hours. These efforts have been upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court ofAppeals and the State courts as well. Many otherlaws can be used as a part of quality-of-lifeenforcement efforts, including ordinances onexcessive noise, dumping the contents of public trash cans, automobile cruising, and the like. While constitutional arguments have been made againstall of these, courts have been uniformly hostile. The most persistent quality-of-life problems will not yield to enforcement efforts alone, for they arerooted in untreated addiction, mental illness, or a combination of both. One of the worst social experiments this country ever imposed on its weakest citizens was theRoger L. Conner 73\u00e4\u00e4deinstitutionalization of people affected by such neurological disorders as schizophrenia andbipolar disorder. In 1955, there were more than559,000 patients in State psychiatric hospitals inthis country. The population of the United Stateshas almost doubled since then, and the number of people with severe mental illness has increased accordingly. There are fewer than 90,000 personsin State mental hospitals, and even taking intoaccount the psychiatric wards of general hospitalsand aftercare facilities, there are approximately750,000 people living in the community who would likely have been inpatients in State psychiatric hospitals in an earlier day. What looks like a qual-ity-of-life problem to be addressed by law enforce-ment is actually an untreated medical problem. Although it may not appear to be related to quality of life on the surface, laws that require insurance companies to provide \"parity\" for mental illness\u2014 so that the need for medication for schizophrenia istreated the same as the need for medication for HIVor Parkinson's\u2014will have a direct effect on qualityof life by preventing some, perhaps many, fromfalling into the clutches of the \"street shrinks\" (i.e., drug dealers). The Mental Health Parity Act of 1996, which took effect January 1, 1998, willrequire large companies to make annual and life-time benefits for mental illnesses equal to thoseoffered for other physical disorders. Several Stateshave adopted or are considering similar laws. As much as we would wish it, however, more serv- ices alone will not do the job. Mental illness oftenblinds the individual to the nature of his or her owncondition. Ed Ehrenright, the son of the founder ofthe California Alliance for the Mentally Ill, recentlystabbed his beloved brother, Mark, to death. The same disorder that made Ed believe he must kill his brother also convinced him that he was not ill anddid not need to take his medication. States are slowly beginning to address the problems of persons like Ehrenright who \"lack insight\" intotheir condition and become \"treatment resistant\" or \"noncompliant.\" North Carolina has been a leader in the use of outpatient commitment, which com-bines release into the community with a meaningfulthreat of institutionalization should the person failto follow through on needed medication. Californiahas used \"conservatorships\" and \"guardianships\" sothat a loved one or friend can step in after the patient loses contact with reality but before he orshe lands on the streets. Other States are using con-ditional releases from mental hospitals, althoughthis affects only a small minority who are admittedto a mental institution in the first place. In a handful of jurisdictions, most notably Massachusetts, local judges are using quality-of-life infractions as anopportunity to plead with, cajole, threaten, andpressure mentally ill persons to return to their treat-ment and medication regimens; this experience sug-gests that we need the mental illness equivalent of drug courts. Finally, New York is in the midst of a 3-year experiment with \"mental health warrants,\"which give judges greater leeway to return patientsto State and city institutions. All of these experiments are edging toward greater community capacity to protect persons with neuro- biological disorders in the same manner that it would protect minor children or persons withAlzheimer's. This discussion may seem far re-moved from the topic of this conference, but it isintimately connected. In the end, you will not beable to provide quality of life in urban centers with- out getting mentally ill persons, particularly those who have severe mental illness, off the streets.Unless we find a legal way to address the needs ofpersons whose mental illness prevents them fromaccepting needed help, quality-of-life enforcementwill fill the jails with broken people; indeed, it already has. The sheriff of Los Angeles County says he is running the largest mental institution inthe world. We should not, as a matter of morality,allow this to continue, or else the courts will even-tually step in. Tough Meets Love Consensus is hard to come by on crime in America. However, there is broad agreement across the politi- cal spectrum that there is a small and \"distinctgroup of [juvenile] offenders who tend to start earlyand continue late in their offending\" who constitutea disproportionate share of the \"violent and seriouspersonal property offenders\" among juveniles. A recent Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) study report calls this group\"serious and violent juvenile (SVJ) offenders.\" TheReagan and Bush administrations reached the samePromising Approaches to Neighborhood Safety 74 \u00e4 \u00e4conclusion but used a different term: \"SHOs\" (\"serious habitual offenders\"). The recent OJJDP report drives home the point that many\u2014perhaps most\u2014of the serious criminals inthe United States make themselves known toneighbors, teachers, principals, juvenile probation officers, police, judges, and jailers early in their \"careers\" with \"behavior problems, including ag-gression, dishonesty, property offenses, and conflictwith authority figures.\" When I walk with peopleat the neighborhood level, they say it is these sameyoung people who provoke the most fear and anger with their swagger, their guns, and their drug-based money. We cannot talk about revitalizing communities without dealing with this group of young people.They drive law-abiding residents into their homes,draw other youths into the streets, and create an insurmountable barrier to the private investment that our distressed neighborhoods need desperately. What are we to do? I think the experience of Patrick Hadley of Ocala, Florida, is instructive. Hadley, arecovering addict and ex-convict who had put hisown life back together, was living in West Ocala, a neighborhood suffused with crack-driven violence, when a drive-by shooting in front of his home im-pelled him to act. After watching the evening news,this anguished father stood on the steps of city hallwith a simple sign: \"I care about West Ocala.\" Soonhe was joined by other men, and they formed the \"Mad Dads\" of Ocala. The Mad Dads marched the streets of West Ocala, driving out the drug dealers with civil rights-stylechants (\"Drug dealer, drug dealer, you can't hide,we charge you with genocide\"). At some point,Hadley did the unthinkable. He offered a hug and a chance to one of the young people who served as a \"tout\" (one who introduces buyers to sellers) fordealers. Others followed. The Mad Dads now oper-ate a mentoring program for hundreds of youngmen and women, a diversion program for the juve-nile courts, and a scholarship program that places their mentoring graduates in junior college. I use the phrase \"tough meets love\" to describe the Mad Dads because the antidrug marches are con-tinuing. Hadley still works with police to identifypeople who are beyond the reach of the love andsupport he offers. The Mad Dads in Ocala, Chloe Cooney's Corporation to Develop Communitiesof Tampa, and the Alliance of Concerned Men atBenning Terrace in Washington, D.C., are only afew examples of hundreds you can find across thecountry. The Corporation to Develop Communities of Tampa has organized civil rights-style marches against drug dealers, replete with chants of \"Drugdealer, drug dealer, you can't hide; we charge youwith genocide.\" The group also offers mentoring,training, and job referrals to win young peopleaway from the dealers. Benning Terrace was one of the most violent places in Washington, D.C., until a handful of \"OGs\" (old guys)\u2014former prisoners anddrug addicts\u2014went into the streets and embracedwarring gangs, bringing them to the table for apeace summit. A truce was arranged; the city hous-ing authority offered gang members jobs rehabili- tating the development. The alliance members mentored and counseled the young people daily.As a result, the entire neighborhood is safer. In1997, there were 45 murders in Benning Terrace.There have been none since the peace accord wasstruck. The promising approaches to dealing with this problem group appear to have at least three thingsin common: 1. The leaders of the programs exude love and sup- port for young people who everyone else hasgiven up on. The love is real because it is rooted in a deep religious faith. 2. The leaders are confident that the targets of their work are making wrong choices, that they needto \"change the way they do business.\" There areno relativists in this group, and no one is intimi-dated by taunts or criticism of paternalism. 3. Neighborhood safety is as important to them as saving individual lives. While they believe inevery young person they take in, there is a toughside to their love for those who spurn the out-reached hand, who try to drag the fellows backto the streets. \"I offer these young men uncondi- tional love,\" Hadley says, \"but if you are going to keep poisoning my children, you ain't mybrother.\" There is a fourth feature that most of these pro- grams lack: A means to keep going once scarceRoger L. Conner 75\u00e4\u00e4Federal demonstrations dollars move on to the political leaders' new hot spot. I applaud the Officeof Weed and Seed's decision to include training forlocal program managers on fund raising so they candig in for the long haul. Almost every communityin this country has a Lung Association (the old TB Society), a Red Cross chapter, Boy Scouts, and more, none of which are receiving Federal grantsto keep their programs alive. I believe there is a keyFederal role, one that has not been recognized, inleading foundations, local governments, and philan-thropists to recognize tough love organizations as a necessary component of a city's health. There are a number of organizations, such as the Council onFoundations and the Philanthropic Round Table,that provide guidance to philanthropists andfoundations. I urge those of you in the FederalGovernment to make them a target of your educa- tional outreach, to prepare the way for the Patrick Hadley's of the world to make their pitch for funds. It is also important for our groups to find self- renewing funding sources. For example, as locallegislators look for alternatives to incarceration, ourneighborhood safety groups should be developing proposals for court-funded diversion programs that would be much more cost effective than jail. Evenmore important, however, is the private market-place. There are many streams of money flowingthrough our communities that could be captured tofinance community-based organizations. For example, a new shopping center was recently developed in Anacostia, bringing a new Safewaystore, among others, to the poorest part of Washing-ton, D.C. We can all point to individual examplesof success in low-income neighborhoods. But theAnacostia Economic Development Corporation (AEDC) has gone one step further. It operated as an investor/developer for this project rather than as an observer or even catalyst. As a result, AEDC has thecontract to manage the Good Hope Market ShoppingCenter, a responsibility that will bring money to theirorganization in perpetuity. It also leveraged govern- ment grants into an equity position in the develop- ment. Linda Goldstein, a lawyer with Goodwin,Proctor & Hoar in Washington, D.C., was thearchitect of AEDC's new role, and she observesthat Safeway, Inc., and other similar businesses willnot take the initiative to make community groupseconomic partners, but they are not opposed to the idea if the community group is represented bylawyers with the skill to assemble the deals. Some organizations that provide treatment and training for addicts are marketing their clients as awork force to finance their drug and alcohol treat- ment. Robin Roberts Harven of Austin has made \"work therapy\" a central component of her drugtreatment program. She argues that the addicts aregetting the benefits of the program and should payfor it with their labor, and the program has beenable to generate enough money from contract work to get off the treadmill of government funding. Not every community has a Robin Roberts Harven, a Chloe Cooney, or a Patrick Hadley. Is governmentpowerless in such places to focus on young peoplewho seem destined for lives of crime? Several com-munities are creating ersatz substitute parents in the form of intensive supervision delivered by govern- ment employees. The Community Intensive Super-vision Project (CISP) in Pittsburgh involves smallsites that allow 20-40 offenders to attend a programbased in their own neighborhoods. Young peopleare picked up at school and transported directly to the CISP sites, where they spend the evening work- ing on catching up to their peers in school, physicalfitness, Narcotics Anonymous sessions, and jobreadiness. Community service is a required partof the program. Young offenders go home at nightwith electronic ankle bracelets. Early evaluations look promising, and CISP is significantly less expensive than jail. There is a mighty struggle going on in low-income communities between the teachers, ministers, andparents and the drug dealers, or what social scientistElijah Anderson terms the \"decent\" versus \"street\" culture. It is extremely hard for government and nongovernment leaders outside the afflicted neigh-borhoods to know how to strengthen the forces ofcommunity rather than try to impose an authoritariansolution. Some of the questions yet to be addressedinclude: lHow do foundations and local government distin-guish between a Patrick Hadley and a ripoff artist? lCan Hadley train other leaders in othercommunities?Promising Approaches to Neighborhood Safety 76 \u00e4 \u00e4lOnce some of the volunteers are given staff posi- tions, will the other volunteers stop working andleave it to the paid staff? Or if there are no staffpositions for full-time volunteers, will the volun-teers burn out and eventually quit or move on? lCan government programs that supply paid mentor/counselors, backed by sanctions, substi- tute for the families these young people need? The Weed and Seed program in particular has created a wealth of experimentation on these ques-tions, and I hope that some of the evaluations tocome will provide answers. A somewhat different approach to intervening in the lives of the most crime-prone offenders is inten-sive drug testing for persons on probation, parole,or otherwise under the control of the criminaljustice system (i.e., after arrest and before trial).I mention this only briefly, since it is one of those rare programs blessed by both academic evaluation research and politicians (President Clinton made itthe topic of a radio address and pushed legislationthrough Congress). What is striking to me is howlittle headway this common sense idea has made,despite its pedigree. Do local officials believe the research? Have we failed to get the information out to them? Have treatment professionals convincedthem that drug testing without an expansion ofinpatient treatment is cruel (although the researchindicates that many offenders can get off drugson their own with sufficient incentives)? Is money really so tight at the local level that successful pro- grams cannot be replicated without Federal grants?Is the problem that intensive drug testing is neitherpunitive enough to generate support from the rightnor gentle enough to generate enthusiasm from theleft? Or did the idea succeed too quickly? (As of this writing, there is no citizens' coalition for drug testing; there are, however, several for extendingprison sentences and building more jails.) In any event, I suggest drug testing as an idea that should command much more forceful leadershipfrom Federal officials whose job it is to speed the adoption of innovative ideas across the country. And I suggest it as a good case study for those ofyou of a more academic bent to identify the impedi-ments to the spread of innovative ideas within thejustice system.A final example of focusing on individuals that I want to mention in passing is the quiet revolutiongoing on with probation and parole. I hope every-one here is familiar with \"Managing Adult SexOffenders in the Community: A ContainmentApproach.\" As reported in that NIJ study report, something very important is happening in Maricopa County, better known as Phoenix, Arizona. Theyhave achieved a recidivism rate among sexualoffenders of less than 2 percent. The MaricopaCounty Probation Department now considers theprevention of crime as its first priority, and it has proven that investments in probation can produce tangible benefits for the community. Maricopa County has two innovations that merit your attention. The first is the way the conditions ofprobation, which have been tailored for this specificgroup of offenders, are enforced: Offenders must submit to weekly Alcoholics Anonymous-type group therapy sessions, monthly lie detector tests,and frequent interaction with specially trainedprobation officers with small caseloads. The secondis that the duration of community supervision hasbeen disconnected from the duration of the maxi- mum sentence. That is, in Arizona, sexual offenders often receive lifetime probation; there are 500 per-sons on lifetime probation in Phoenix alone. I could say more about the reinvigoration of proba- tion and parole, but since I share this session withone of the Nation's leading experts on that subject, David Kennedy, I will leave further discussion of this important topic to him. One way of thinking about crime prevention is to focus on the offenders who have committed mostof the crimes\u2014the approach of the programs I havejust discussed. Maryland and Pennsylvania are tak- ing another approach entirely; they are focusing on the places where most of the crimes take place. Under the leadership of Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and Michael Sarbanes, Executive Direc-tor of the Governor's Office of Crime Control andPrevention, Maryland has applied crime-mapping techniques to every county in the State. What they found was that every city and town, even quitesmall ones, had specific locations that accountedfor much of their local reported crime. From thisinsight and Sarbanes' experience at the CommunityLaw Center in Baltimore has come the \"MarylandRoger L. Conner 77\u00e4\u00e4Hot Spots Communities Program,\" which encour- ages local officials to use community mobilizationand collaborative problem solving to address theenvironment in each of these locations. Although Pennsylvania is a much bigger State, it is taking a similar approach. David Castro, who formerly ran the Drug Nuisance Task Force for Philadelphia District Attorney Lynn Abraham, isnow Director of the State Weed and Seed program,operated out of the Pennsylvania Crime Commis-sion. Castro's staff tries to identify \"hot spots\"; cre-ate collaborative teams of State, Federal, and local officials; generate highly concentrated enforcement activities; and promote leadership development. Conclusion It seems to me that the promising approaches I haveoutlined above have some features in common.They involve a renewed focus on specific peopleand specific places in order to solve specific prob- lems that are of concern to the community. Most of them involve the community outside the justicesystem in a newly robust partnership with thetraditional agencies responsible for crime and pun-ishment. In other words, there are signs that JeremyTravis' prediction, which I cited at the beginning of this talk\u2014that the ideas at the heart of community policing might spill over into other parts of thejustice system and the community itself\u2014might bemore than wishful thinking after all. I certainlyhope so. Notes 1.

In a recent interview in the Chicago Sun-Times, researcher Robert J. Sampson summarized a decade ofresearch on crime and delinquency this way: [T]he little things matter... we ask about things like kids skipping school, spray painting graffiti, showing disrespect to an adult ... these are simple, everyday activities of children, not seriouscrimes .. . what we find is that the collectivewillingness of adults to intervene and showresponsibility for children with regard to theseactivities varies considerably across neighbor- hoods. Where it is high, crime seems to be low. Groups such as the Mad Dads are, perhaps, a way to return this kind of consistent adult feedback to youthswho have a foot on the slippery slope. 5.

Research Questions and Implications for Evaluation Design81\u00e4\u00e4Dynamic Strategic Assessment and Feedback: An Integrated Approach toPromoting Community Revitalization Terence Dunworth In addition, I see them reiterated when you look at the relevant literature. When James Gibson gave histalk at the beginning of this conference, he summa-rized the actual responses and the interventions thathave been made, particularly at the Federal level,focusing on this idea that communities are declin- ing and that many are in a state of distress. He made the point that what he has seen in the 30 yearsthat he has been involved in this field is a reinven-tion, a redeclaration, a rediscovery\u2014he used manywords beginning with \"re.\" I am using the same\"re\" with respect to the ideas that we have. We are repeatedly expressing ideas that others developed previously. If we buy into this notion that most of the ideas and most of the interventions have been tried before,and yet we still have distressed communities, wehave to ask ourselves what we are doing. We have a national Weed and Seed effort trying to address these problems. How are we going to go about do-ing it? If we acknowledge that most of the interven-tions that we can think of have been tried before,then what is it that we can do that we think is differ-ent and that will accomplish things in the future that we haven't been able to accomplish in the past? It is easy to become disheartened by this thought. But I am not, because I believe there are ways wecan do things differently. Change is possible not somuch in the area of the specific interventions but inthe way we go about things. This is what I want to talk about today. Before I go on, I want to stress that my comments should not be construed as acriticism of the work that has been done, the ideasthat have been expressed, or the interventions thathave been undertaken in the past\u2014some of whichhave been successful, some of which have not.About 70 years ago, John Dewey wrote a book called The Public and Its Problems . 1 Dewey was one of the foremost educational and social thinkersof this century, and the observations he made in hiswritings are perceptive and provocative. I first readthis book about 25 years ago, and its timeless themes have stayed with me over the years. This book has been constantly on my mind during the2 years that I have been involved in the nationalevaluation of Weed and Seed, because it directlyfocuses on the kinds of things that we have beenconsidering in the evaluation\u2014that is, issues that we have been discussing at this conference. One of the main arguments in The Public and Its Problems is that the sense of community that ex- isted at an earlier time eroded as the Western indus-trialized world developed. Dewey wrote that thiserosion in the sense of community that people once felt has led to many of the problems that the public now faces. These problems are, of course: crime;social disorder; a loss of the sense of communityand well-being; a decline in the sense of interde-pendence among people; and the idea that thefuture and the present are intermingled and that when things go well for a neighborhood they go well for you, and when they go badly for a neigh-borhood they go badly for you. The erosion ofthese concepts led to a sense of isolation for manypeople. For me, Dewey's book illustrates something that I have come to believe since I have been involved in Weed and Seed. There is hardly anything, certainlyno idea that I have had, that hasn't been said orwritten previously. Many of the ideas that we thinkare fundamental now in the discussions that we arehaving about Weed and Seed are in this book.Dynamic Strategic Assessment and Feedback 82 \u00e4 \u00e4I want to suggest that we need to reorient the way we think about community revitalization and howwe go about trying to achieve it. There are two primary areas where I think it is possible to accomplish something. One of them isthe structure and the organization of the effort that we want to make; the other area is how we assess whether or not that effort is having the effect wewant it to have. The latter, of course, is what wehave always referred to as research and evaluation.Over time, I have become somewhat disenchantedwith these two terms because they imply an orienta- tion toward finding out what works and what does not work that, in my opinion, has become out-moded and lost its utility. I will elaborate on thatidea as I go along. Structure and Organization With respect to structure and organization, thereare a few basic premises that must be emphasized. I don't mean that these premises have never been discussed before. I expect that most of you havethought about them yourselves. But I would suggestthat we\u2014and I include the Federal agencies as wellas the research community\u2014have not implementedthese ideas effectively. The first premise is that community revitalization must be approached strategically at the governmen-tal level. A government program that focuses on arelatively narrow definition of the problem\u2014withthe definition of that problem being made at theFederal level\u2014will not be effective. A community revitalization effort has to be strategic and has to embrace all of the issues that influence communityrevitalization. This means that at the Federal level,interagency cooperation and collaboration mustoccur in an overt and direct way. Communities willnot be helped if the Department of Justice does its own thing, the Department of Education does its own thing, the Department of Labor does its ownthing, and so on. Traditionally, however, ourpolitical system leads to that kind of orientation.It establishes turf boundaries between these differ-ent agencies, and these boundaries are difficult to break down. This is one of the reasons why our current ideas about intervention have probably beendefined and attempted in some setting other thanthe one we are presently considering. What we have not done is develop the interventions in a strategicfashion, especially at governmental levels. I thinkthat needs to change if we are going to make muchprogress. The second premise with respect to structure and organization is that as we define community revital- ization and think about the things we want to do,we must do so from the community up, not fromthe government down. The definition of the prob-lem has to be at the community level, not at theFederal level. There has been a tendency in the past where the Federal agency involved essentially says: Uh huh, there is a problem out there. Here is the definition of that problem,and this is the solution we want to ap-ply to it. We will do a couple of thingsto get local communities to embrace our solution. One is that we will throw money at them to get them to acceptour approach. The other is that if theydo not do it our way, then we will takethe money back. There has been an imposition from the Federal level to the community level not only with respect to the definition of the problem but also with respect tothe approach to dealing with it. I think that has tochange. I don't mean to imply that there are zeroinstances in which this already takes place. I knowthere are some. But there are not enough, and they are not systematic. The Federal Government and the Federal agencies involved need to embracethis notion overtly, start from the bottom up, bringcommunity agencies and organizations into theplanning process at the outset, and concentrateon strategic designs for community revitalization efforts. This leads to another consideration: Community revitalization and the strategic design that shouldbe undertaken with respect to it need to be multifac-eted. This underlines the point I have been tryingto make\u2014that interagency coordination is a pre- requisite because you cannot have a multifaceted approach unless you have different agencies partici-pating collaboratively. This has to take place at both the Federal and local levels.Terence Dunworth 83\u00e4\u00e4Another problem experienced in urban areas is that local politics with respect to these kinds of turfissues and interagency conflict can be destructive.The best intentions can be thwarted by the localpolitical considerations that come into play. Wehave to find some way to deal with these issues and develop an integrated approach on the local level as well as the Federal level. There is an implication behind these ideas that we often do not address well or think about much: Ifthese considerations are true, then what is neededis diversity of approach. By that I mean that the approach to be undertaken in \"jurisdiction A\" may not be suited to the approach needed by \"jurisdic-tion B.\" This confounds in some ways a fundamen-tal principle of the Federal approach to these kindsof problems. For instance, those of you who havebeen around for some time will be familiar with phrases such as \"programs of proven effectiveness\" and \"technology transfer.\" The idea embodied inthese terms is that if you go out to a particularcommunity, try a particular approach, and it works,then you have developed something that can beessentially lifted, taken somewhere else, and put down with the expectation that it will work in the same way. The actual practice of doing this hasnot produced much in the way of positive results.It would be a terrific concept if it worked, but itdoesn't seem to work in practice very often. Oneof the reasons it does not is that the situation in the new place where this program is put down is, in fact, quite different than the one from which theprogram came, but the key ways in which this is soare not well understood. The point is that somethingentirely different has to be developed for this sec-ond jurisdiction. Locally focused strategic planning offers the hope of accomplishing this. These ideas have enormous implications for every aspect of community revitalization and the fundingstream. It suggests that having the same level offunding for \"jurisdiction A\" and \"jurisdiction B\"may not make sense because the problem and the context are different and so may require a different level of funding. It also implies that the mix of pro-grams in this multifaceted approach may need to bequite different. Even if \"jurisdiction B\" has a prob-lem that seems similar to the problem experiencedin \"jurisdiction A,\" an approach that works in thelatter does not necessarily fit the former. It is the reason an intervention that seems to have positiveresults in one jurisdiction has disappointing conse-quences when transferred. I think this is because wehave not properly understood the variation betweenlocal jurisdictions, and we have not defined local needs properly. This stems from the lack of orienta- tion that I was talking about earlier. Research and Evaluation There are also research and evaluation imperativesthat flow from these ideas that are quite differentfrom the traditional approach that researchers andevaluators like myself have tended to take in the past. Loosely speaking, we are trained to follow the medical research model as closely as we can. Wewould like to randomize selection of participants inprograms. We would like to have experimental andcontrol groups. We would like to track things over aperiod of time and have a lot of information that we can compare from one place to another and from one time to another. In the end, with that orienta-tion, the medical model promises a better chanceof defining the actual impact and the outcome ofa particular strategy and a particular intervention.I have lost confidence in the idea that this will work in the community revitalization world. I have not lost confidence in the idea that it can work in otherkinds of contexts or that it can work with respect toa particular, relatively narrow intervention withina community. But I am arguing that the medicalmodel of inquiry will not help us decide whether or not a particular community revitalization effort based on a particular strategy design for that juris-diction is doing what we want it to do. Somethingdifferent is needed. I will try to state some generalparameters defining what that orientation oughtto be. First, one of the premises of the traditional ap- proach that I was describing is that the evaluationand research component is of the stand-back type.We stand back here and look at you implementingan intervention, and we make our notes and obser-vations, and at the end of your intervention we will say it did or did not work. We will do a process kind of orientation as well and say, \"Well, the rea-son it didn't work is that they didn't do this or theydidn't do that, or they didn't cover their bases,\" andDynamic Strategic Assessment and Feedback 84 \u00e4 \u00e4so on. I do not think that is good enough. What is going to be needed is for the research and evalua-tion component to participate intimately with theprogrammatic component from the beginning. I donot think there is any point in expecting researchand evaluation to produce useful information about a community revitalization program unless partici- pation of the research and evaluation people startsat the beginning. If you admit this, the nature ofwhat comes next has changed because you are nolonger the detached, objective observer. You getdrawn into being a participant with the program- matic effort. This is the price, and it is a high price, that has to be paid for the orientation I am promot-ing. That price is that you lose objectivity and yourindependence, because you get drawn in and havea vested interest in the outcome. For example, asyou are going along with this process, you become involved in midcourse corrections. You can say in conjunction with the program people\u2014let's sayafter 10 percent of the time has gone by and 10 per-cent of the program has been implemented\u2014that itlooks like you are going in the wrong direction andmaybe a change is needed. If we are shooting an astronaut to the Moon and I am evaluating that program for its effectiveness,and I see when she is halfway there that she isgoing to hit Mars, not the Moon, what am I goingto do? Can I stand back and say, \"Boy, am I goingto have a story to write when this is over,\" when that astronaut is on Mars but she ought to be on the Moon? Of course I am not going to do that. I amgoing to say that a midcourse correction must bemade because we want this ship to go to the Moon,not to Mars. We need to do the same thing inrespect to community revitalization. Once I start doing that, I am no longer a traditional evaluator. I've lost my independence and my objectivity.To me that no longer matters. I know it matters tomany researchers and evaluators, and I understandthat point of view. But to me it no longer mattersbecause I want what I do to have an effect and to help the program. I view the role that we can play as researchers and evaluators to be one in which wewill make a contribution to programmatic successin the present and not one that will only turn in ascorecard and maybe provide a guide to futureprogrammatic design.Many things will be affected by this change in ori- entation. The notions of technology transfer andprograms of proven effectiveness are two of them.I do not look to them as being the primary out-comes of what we can do in the research and evalu-ation world. I also think that my orientation will produce outcome evaluations that are probabilistic rather than definitive. It will be \"iffy.\" It will beextremely difficult to be definite about what theoutcomes actually are and what one's own objectiv-ity is with respect to them. Further, the timeframefor most interventions is probably unrealistic. To some extent, this is a Federal funding issue, a political issue, and it is of extreme importance.The timeframe that most Federal programs havein mind is 1 or 2 years at the most, occasionally abit longer. Weed and Seed has had a 3- to 4-yeartimeframe. At the end of that time, an evaluation will be written, saying whether the program suc- ceeded or failed. I am not sure that is even longenough to expect a community to start to turnaround. How about a decade? How about 15 years?The problem with that, of course, is that yourpolitical capital may not last that long. This is a very difficult issue to deal with. This suggests that not every distressed community is a candidate for community revitalization.There are some preconditions needed to determinewhether a community can be turned around. Theseshould be considered in the problem definition stage when the strategic orientation toward revital- ization is being set up in a locally specific context.We should expect to find that certain communitiesthat clearly are distressed to the point of needingintervention are nevertheless not likely to respondto the kind of interventions that can be mounted by programs such as Weed and Seed. For example, the central tenet of Weed and Seed is that a community can be strengthened by reducingcriminal activity and increasing social programs.This approach is likely to make a community moreresistant to the resurgence of crime. Implicit in this view is the idea that long-term residence in the community is likely for a significant number of itsinhabitants. It is through these residents that a com-munity will revitalize itself. If, on the other hand, atroubled community is characterized by high turn-over, with residents' objectives being to leave asTerence Dunworth 85\u00e4\u00e4quickly as possible, then it is difficult to have confi- dence that the Weed and Seed approach can havemuch long-term effect. I'll conclude by restating three main points. First, how things are organized at the Federal level iscritical. The effort must extend beyond agencies, and it must be strategic. Second, the approach that we want to undertake must be communitywide. Itmust be a saturation model, multifaceted and com-munity driven. We cannot impose anything from theFederal level. It has got to come from the bottomup. And third, we have got to have what we are calling a dynamic strategic assessment and feed-back approach to research and evaluation whereresearchers like us participate from the very begin-ning and continue until the very end. We must bemore than detached observers: We must be directly involved. Note 1. Dewey, John, The Public and Its Problems , New York: H. Holt, 1927.87\u00e4\u00e4Community Crime Analysis John P. O'Connell ments in criminal justice analysis need to take place at the State and local levels of government, wherecrime and crime policy meet in the United States. New Tools for Mapping Crime Probably the best example of progress in crimeanalysis is the trend in police departments to movefrom crime pin maps to computerized geocoding of crime. Merging jurisdiction maps with crime and arrest data is transforming crime analysis fromcrime counts to assessments of types of crime intime and space. This \"simple\" expansion of ourknowledge of crime is revolutionizing our conceptof crime. New York City, Chicago, San Diego, Montgomery County, Maryland, and others using off-the-shelf mapping software know more aboutcrime in their communities than they have everknown before. This hands-on knowledge is funda-mentally changing police operations. Crime statis-tics are no longer limited to end-of-year summaries. With the new computer software, precinct- and street-level reporting are changing how police dealwith crime. District commanders are required to usechanging profiles of crime in their progress reportsand strategic plans. Precinct captains and shift com-manders are required to review and comment on the previous day's crime maps. For the first time, offic- ers in each new shift, as they hit the streets, knowwhat happened during the previous shift. As exciting as the computer-aided crime maps are, they are only the first step toward breaking out ofthe \"counting\" syndrome. Adding the two \"real time\" variables of time and location to crime analy- sis demonstrates that crime is not an isolated event.Police departments moving to real-time computer-ized crime analysis also are moving toward moreproactive policing and depending less on reactivemethods.Analyzing Crime in Our Communities Community Crime Analysis Analysis of community issues in relation to crime tends to examine the criminal and crime events asseparate factors. Most headlines and political re-sponses are reactions to changes in crime. If crimeis up, we wring our hands and we speculate aboutassociations between crime and unemployment, funding shortages for criminal justice system opera- tions, illicit drugs, and the decay of social order.If crime is down, we congratulate ourselves andspeculate about associations between crime andemployment, programs for the criminal justicesystem, and the decline of the importance of illicit drugs. A significant reason that criminal justice analysis is so focused on this type of \"univariate\" analysis is that opportunities for resources for new criminaljustice data are scarce. We are excited if we canfind a database that is complete, accurate, and timely. Even when we find a \"good database,\" it is limited to a local or State criminal justice systemthat records data for only one part of the criminaljustice system\u2014such as reported crime, arrests, orcorrectional populations. We can count crime orcriminals in prison, and we can even apply sophisti- cated models to this one dimensional view of crime, but we are not necessarily conversant with thenature of crime. As important as U.S. Department of Justice inten- sive studies are, their impact is largely theoretical;they seldom have a direct impact on State or local policies, budgets, or programs. These reports are usually not timely and are of secondary interest topoliticians and practitioners because they do notpertain to their particular community. Improve-Community Crime Analysis 88 \u00e4 \u00e4Analyzing Crime as a Non- Isolated Event, or Four Waysto Better Understand Crimein Our Communities Crime is Not an Isolated Event: Crime Has Victims Our understanding of crime and how to deal with it in our communities will improve as we conceptual-ize crime not only as something limited to criminalsbut also as a troublesome and tragic event for crimevictims and communities. Expanding crime analy-sis to include victim-offender relationships is important for understanding crime in our communi- ties. Two useful examples of victim-offender rela-tionships are shown below. Juvenile Crime Victims and Their Perpetrators: Felony Sexual Assault (see exhibit 1) shows the relationship between the ages of juvenile victims of felony sexual assault and the ages of the perpetra- tors. This analysis provides important informationfor both police investigators and social workers.Although there are proportionally fewer infant vic- tims of felony sexual assault (compared with otherage groups), the perpetrators in these cases are usu-ally middle-aged males. Juveniles (under 18) rapingjuveniles becomes a significant problem when thevictim is between 3 and 5 years old. Peer rape (i.e., juveniles raping juveniles of the same age) is not a major phenomena but is most likely to happenwhen both the victim and perpetrator are between15 and 17 years old. Criminal History Patterns for Victims and Perpetra- tors of Wilmington Shooting Incidents (see exhibit 2) shows a different aspect of victim-offender rela- tionship studies. Shootings in Wilmington, Dela-ware, have increased significantly over the past2 years, causing not only fear in the at-risk commu-nities but also in the surrounding neighborhoods.An indepth study of the sudden change in firearm violence showed not only that shootings were asso- ciated with open-air drug markets but that the vic-tims where almost as likely to be involved in priordrug sales, felony crime, and firearm activity as theperpetrators. While not diminishing the importanceof the increase in shooting, the victim-offender Exhibit 1. Juvenile Crime Victims and Their Perpetrators: Felony Sexual Assault Percentage of Offenders Source: Delaware Statistical Analysis Center, January P. O'Connell 89\u00e4\u00e4relationship study helped pinpoint the fact that the increase was not random but was tied to a signifi-cant degree to the illicit drug trade. Crime is Not an Isolated Event: Offenders Who Go to PrisonReturn to the Community andOften Recidivate One of the solutions to crime has been to target those perceived to be the most dangerous andremove them from the streets for longer periods of time. Mandatory sentences and truth-in-sentencing laws, which require offenders to serve a minimumof 85 percent of their sentences, are two examplesof this policy. These incarceration policies provideincreased \"specific deterrence\" in that selectedoffenders are kept out of a community for a greater period of time. However, even these offenders even- tually return to the community. A community mayhave \"bought time\" by keeping some of the worstoffenders locked up longer, but when they return,the issues of rehabilitation and recidivism becomethe community reality. Can these offenders be successfully integrated into their communities? Currently, we know that 60 percent or more will beback in prison again within 5 years\u2014after commit- ting other serious crimes in the community. New Castle County, Delaware: Locations of Department of Correction Inmates Released inFourth Quarter, 1996 , and Wilmington: Locations of Department of Correction Inmates Released in Fourth Quarter, 1996 (see exhibits 3 and 4), show the relationship between the geographic dispersionof offenders returning to their communities and thelocation of important community rehabilitative ser-vices that can be key to their becoming constructivemembers of the community. In the southern part of New Castle County, there are significant clusters of former Department ofCorrection inmates with few drug rehabilitation orsocial services located nearby. This representsreduced opportunities for rehabilitation. In Wilmington, there appears to be a better associa- tion between the location of social services facilities and former inmates. The irony is, however, that theservices may not be well used by former inmatesdespite the fact that they are located closer to them.In part, this may reflect how difficult it is to placeoffenders in services well matched to their needs.

Wilmington: Locations of Department of Correction Inmates Released in Fourth Quarter, 1996Community Crime Analysis 92 \u00e4 \u00e4Crime is Not an Isolated Event: Resi- dents of High-Crime CommunitiesDo Not Always Victimize Themselves Delaware has been fortunate in that the U.S. De- partment of Justice (DOJ) Weed and Seed programhas provided it with long-term program evaluationfunds. In part, these funds have allowed Delawareand the city of Wilmington to build a crime data-base focusing on a \"community at risk.\" From this database, new analyses are emerging that demon- strate different dimensions of crime in ourcommunities. An important finding from Delaware's Weed and Seed database is that at-risk communities are nothaving difficulty just because of internal problems. A significant portion of crime in Weed and Seed neighborhoods is committed by perpetrators wholive outside the areas. Journey to Crime: Weed and Seed Area Drug Ar- rests (see exhibit 5) shows that 45 percent of the persons arrested in Delaware's Weed and Seed neighborhoods for illicit drug sales and possession reside outside of the neighborhoods. Twenty per-cent of the arrestees live elsewhere in Wilmington,16 percent live in suburban New Castle Countyor other counties in Delaware, and 6.5 percent arefrom other States (2.4 percent do not have a known address). Taking into account the amount of crime committed by outsiders in at-risk neighborhoods creates a newpolicy issue. How would quality of life in a neigh-borhood improve if people from outside the areawere somehow dissuaded from coming into these neighborhoods? Crime is Not an Isolated Event: The Association Between Crimeand Other Social Problems NeedsGreater Exploration Wilmington Shooting Incidents and Poverty-Level, Female-Headed Households With Children Under18 (see exhibit 6) shows the association between shooting incidents and households headed by poorwomen in at-risk neighborhoods. The association between crime and such social indicators takes on stark reality when we see that many of our mostvulnerable families live close to where shootings occur. Although there is an association betweensocial indicators and crime, the meaning of thisrelationship is not well understood. It is not uncommon to believe that low income, unemployment, lack of education, and families headed by single parents somehow result in crime. Arrest and sentencing patterns would indicate thatthis is true to some degree. However, will reducingthe prevalence of such social indicators alone be acure for crime? The fact that crime is more preva-lent in our at-risk communities raises the possibility of a feedback or \"interaction\" effect; that is, the level of crime in at-risk neighborhoods is just aslikely to be related to the mere presence of crimi-nals, because they provide social interaction andexamples that can influence those not involved incriminal behavior. Two Federal programs may provide an opportunity to analyze community crime in a way that goes be-yond merely counting, reporting, and emotionallyreacting to crime. The first, the Weed and Seedstrategy, addresses some of the issues raised in thispaper. First you control crime, then you build pro- grams that strengthen the community and enable it to resist crime\u2014an approach that does more thanjust arrest and incarcerate criminals. The second program, which is smaller in scale than the Weed and Seed program, is DOJ's Safe Streetsinitiative. This program also takes a comprehensive social approach to crime in at-risk neighborhoods. Not only is this initiative concerned with crime andsocial programs, it includes education, employ-ment, child abuse, and child development as vari-ables to be addressed and studied in an interactivemanner. Hindrances to Improving Crime Analysis In OurCommunities Bringing the Analysis to the Local Level For crime analysis to be effective in communities, a significant change needs to take place. Today,except for a few efforts around the country, mostJohn P. O'Connell 93\u00e4\u00e4 Exhibit 5. Journey to Crime: Weed and Seed Area Drug ArrestsCommunity Crime Analysis 94 \u00e4 \u00e4 Location of ShootingExhibit 6. Wilmington Shooting Incidents and Poverty-Level, Female-Headed Households With Children Under 18John P. O'Connell 95\u00e4\u00e4community crime analysis is limited to counting crimes and reporting change. This level of knowl-edge does not allow us to understand the cycle ofcrime and the best ways to break it. Policymakers'thinking is limited to believing that if crime isgoing up, you put more police resources on the job; if crime is going down, you declare success because the upward trend has changed. Local analysis that goes beyond crime counting is recognized and embraced wherever it happens.Each step in expanding our knowledge of commu-nity crime sources and patterns will change our policy and programmatic points of view on better ways to address crime. The most striking exampleof this is computer-aided mapping of crime in com-munities. This single advancement of knowledgeabout crime in a community is causing a paradigmshift in how police recognize, deal with, and plan for crime. New methods of policing will no doubt change the way police and citizens interact. In Wilmington, the methods described in this paper have affected policy regarding crime incommunities. Community policing has a chanceof being institutionalized because a decade of com- munity crime analysis has shown neighborhoods with active community policing not only routinelyreduce crime, but the citizens report a better senseof ownership and quality of life. Less crime in aneighborhood also seems to be a precursor ofeconomic development. Getting States and local communities to do this level of crime analysis requires a change in howcriminal justice analysis and planning are viewedat the State and local levels. First, a research unitneeds to have the authority to work with single ormultiple jurisdictions across the State. The products of this State and local research unit need to be described to tactical and strategic decisionmakers.New knowledge is one of the ingredients of innova-tion. Without verifiable knowledge about the natureof crime, we will find ourselves falling back on theconvenient emotional responses of fear, denial, and congratulations.Lack of money and leadership to encourage the development of State and local community crimeand policy analysis are the greatest limitations tobetter understanding crime in our communities. Joining Criminal Justice Databases With Social Services Databases DOJ's Safe Streets initiative is one of the first criminal justice initiatives that explicitly seeks to examine crime in our communities from more than just a criminal justice point of view. In this initia-tive, DOJ is expanding community crime analysisto include employment status, child abuse, andeducational success as crucial variables to betterunderstand crime in our communities. Expanding criminal justice analysis beyond crimi- nal justice statistics will help community criminaljustice analysts move in the same direction as otherFederal agencies that are studying harmful indica-tors in our communities. For instance, the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention has expanded public health research into the areas of victims of shootings and domestic violence, although tradi-tionally these were solely in the criminal justicebailiwick. An advantage of cross-fertilization ofcriminal justice and noncriminal justice researchmethods is that the study of harm in our communi- ties would be expanded. We would be able not only to understand crime from the criminal justicepoint of view but also to expand our perceptions toinclude the relationship of crime to family develop-ment, education, addiction, and economics. Combining the traditional criminal justice study topics with the points of view of other disciplines, while potentially fruitful, will mean at least twotechnical changes. First, as we find the need to inte-grate criminal justice and social services databases,we will need to work through confidentiality re-quirements. Second, optimal analysis would allow us to commingle an individual's data from various disciplines. This will be problematic because alldata systems have difficulty in positively identify-ing and tracking individuals. The problems ofindividual identification will increase significantlyas we try to join databases.97\u00e4\u00e4What Do We Do Next? Research Questions and Implications forEvaluation Design Jan Roehl Overview Because the roots of crime, fear, and disorder in communities are complex and intertwined, currentand future programs to address these problems tendto encompass a variety of prevention and interven-tion strategies under the auspices of many actorsand agencies. This paper advocates an emphasis on rigorous process evaluations of these \"kitchen sink\" programs, aimed at describing what has happened,where it has happened, what the immediate resultsare, and how others might best package these multi-faceted approaches to effect positive communitychange. Community Crime Prevention and Revitalization Efforts ofthe Future Today, programs to decrease crime and revitalize communities tend to involve comprehensive andcoordinated efforts to control crime and drugsand improve the quality of life. They combine the\"best\" prevention and intervention approaches ofthe past two decades with the recognition that the causes and solutions of crime and community problems are interconnected and are best addressedon multiple fronts with extensive involvementfrom many community institutions. Examples ofthese \"kitchen sink\" programs\u2014which at timesseem to include every strategy known\u2014are the U.S. Department of Justice's Weed and Seed and Comprehensive Communities programs, the Centerfor Substance Abuse Prevention's CommunityPartnership Program, the Robert Wood JohnsonFoundation's Fighting Back program, and manycomprehensive efforts launched locally (see, for example, Clarke, 1992; Davis and Lurigio, 1996;Green, 1996; National Crime Prevention Council, 1992; Roehl et al., 1995a; Weingart et al., 1993). The main characteristics of these programs are part- nerships among the community, police, city agen-cies, the private sector, and others; problem solvingto address specific problems and problem places; an emphasis on prevention; and efforts to increase com- munity capacity building and citizen empowermentfor problem solving. The specific strategies appliedare many and varied, ranging from primary preven-tion efforts targeted to young children to intense drugenforcement efforts by the police. Some of these programs, notably Weed and Seed, also encompass macrostrategies such as economic development andcommunity health care. The \"leader\"\u2014the sponsor,catalyst, grant recipient, etc.\u2014varies from city to cityand may be the police department, a communityorganization, a nonprofit group, or a city agency. These \"kitchen sink\" programs may include other strategies popular today, such as place-basedresearch (Eck and Weisburd, 1995), communitypolicing efforts (Rosenbaum and Lurigio, 1994;Goldstein, 1993), and school- and family-basedprevention programs (Sherman et al., 1997). Many problem-solving and civil remedy strategies focus on specific locations\u2014in Weisburd's (1997) view,crime reduction might be more effective if itfocused on the criminal history of a place ratherthan an individual. Recent reports suggest that these types of partnership-based, multifaceted programs will continue to flourish. A recent monograph on inno-vative State and local programs to revitalize com-munities, for example, presents case studies of24 current programs (Bureau of Justice Assistance,1997). Of the 24 programs, about half are com-What Do We Do Next? Research Questions and Implications for Evaluation Design 98 \u00e4 \u00e4munitywide partnerships with multiple strategies underway; one-third are prevention/interventionprograms for youths (alternative schools, rolemodeling, etc.); two programs are civil abatementoriented; and three programs offer, respectively,an offender work program, a domestic violence program, and antigang efforts through a task force. The common themes of these programs are part-nerships, multiple intervention strategies at theneighborhood level, prevention, problem solvingthrough nuisance abatement, interventions withdelinquents and offenders, and targeted law enforcement. In Sherman et al.'s (1997) report on \"What Works, What Doesn't, and What's Promising\" in crimeprevention, the authors conclude that seven institu-tions\u2014communities, families, schools, labormarkets, places, police, and criminal justice\u2014are interdependent in affecting crime at the local level. They promote the study of programs that investsimultaneously in these multiple institutions, such asthe Weed and Seed program. While Sherman et al.advocate more rigorous study of innovative programswith adequate scientific controls for the careful study of program effectiveness, they also suggest that more support is needed to \"learn why some innovations work, exactly what was done, and how they can be successfully adapted in other cities\" (p. xii). The key variable in designing evaluations for \"kitchen sink\" programs is that the unit of analysis is the community or neighborhood. For any form of evaluation research, we need to usefully definecommunity; such a definition would go beyond out-lining its physical characteristics and boundaries toencompass the cultural, social, and political factorsthat define community. The community as the unit of analysis has far-reaching implications for evalua- tion design. Research Questions The global research question for programs that aimto decrease crime and revitalize communities iswhether they result in a safer, better community.Measuring \"safer\" and \"better,\" of course, is the challenging task. I suggest that the key questions should be whether the communitywide programsmake a positive difference, at the neighborhoodlevel and over time, in:lThe quality of community life, measured by resi-dents' and businessowners' satisfaction with theirneighborhood, fear of crime, level of problems(e.g., drugs, incivilities, trash), and physicalcharacter (e.g., vacant buildings). lCrime and delinquency. lThe social character of the neighborhood (e.g.,informal social control, empowerment of resi-dents, and the organizational capacity of commu-nity organizations). lEconomic vitality (e.g., unemployment, Aid toFamilies With Dependent Children levels, need for subsidized housing, property values). lThe stability of the neighborhood. lCitizen satisfaction with the police, based on principles of procedural justice (e.g., fairness,trust, respect). One of the problems faced by evaluators is the lack of data easily available at the neighborhood level. Existing indicators of change\u2014for example, tru-ancy or unemployment figures\u2014are rarely availablefor defined areas such as neighborhoods. Even withthe growing adoption of sophisticated mappingcapabilities, data on reported crime, calls for ser- vice, etc., remain costly and difficult to get at the neighborhood level. Implications for Evaluation Design In a recent solicitation for evaluations of programs funded under the 1994 Federal crime bill releasedby the California State Office of Criminal JusticePlanning (OCJP), the proposal requirements in- clude the following: \"Proposals must demonstrate a balance between rigorous research and evaluationmethodology and usefulness to customers, stake-holders, and policymakers\" (OCJP Request forProposals, December 5, 1997, p. 5). This requirement implies that one cannot have itboth ways and extends the commonly held belief that \"rigorous\" pertains only to impact evaluations, not to process evaluations. I contendthat one can have it both ways, with rigorous process evaluations producing a wealth of infor-Jan Roehl 99\u00e4\u00e4mation useful to customers, stakeholders, and policymakers. A rigorous process evaluation willdescribe in detail, using multiple qualitative andquantitative measures, program implementation,daily operations, management, strategies andservices, actors and agencies involved, and immediate outcomes. To answer the multiple research questions sketched out above is to ask the single, classic evaluationquestion: What works where? My focus is first onwhat and second on where, partly because others will argue strongly for a focus on works and pro- pose an emphasis on impact evaluations with ex- perimental designs. But mostly my focus on whatand where stems from strong beliefs that processevaluations are most needed to meet the goals ofusefulness and that the most rigorous impact evalu- ations we can hope to implement with available funds will always leave open questions of attribu- tion, displacement, and measurement bias. Recent crime reduction efforts serve as illustrations of the need for process evaluation. In New YorkCity, dramatic decreases in reported crime havebeen attributed by former Commissioner William Bratton to police actions. These police actions, pri- marily reported in the media, apparently included\"results-oriented management\" and a focus on pettycrime and youth offenders. For the most part, how-ever, we don't know exactly what was done there,and many are skeptical of reported crime outcomes and/or that police action caused them. Until recent journalistic accounts by Bratton (1998) and Kellingand Coles (1996), no written documentation on thestrategies or their outcomes was available. Withouta process evaluation, details on what took place\u2014positive and negative\u2014are scarce. Jurisdictions de- siring to emulate the New York City model must contract with Bratton's new consulting firm to getthis assistance. Community policing has been in full flower for nearly a decade. There has been much debate aboutwhat it entails, whether it is effective, how the com- munity and others are involved, and how it is best managed and operationalized. While there is gen-eral acceptance that two dominant characteristicsof community policing are partnerships and prob-lem solving (Bureau of Justice Assistance, 1994;Roberg, 1994), we are still arguing about what it isand what it is not. Only a handful of studies address what community police officers \"do\" while theyare doing community policing (e.g., Wycoff andOettmeier, 1994; Capowich and Roehl, 1994;Mastrofski et al., 1998). A final, positive example of the need for process evaluation is the Weed and Seed program. The Weed and Seed program was launched in 1992with funding to 19 cities to implement the multi-faceted programs focused on weeding (intensivearrest and prosecution), community policing, andseeding (prevention, intervention, and treatment and neighborhood revitalization). Today, as many as 120 cities have been funded or officially recog-nized as Weed and Seed sites. Yet the national im-pact evaluation is just reaching completion today,as scheduled, nearly 6 years after the start of theprogram. The belief in the value of the Weed and Seed approach may be partially attributed to the findings of the national process evaluation, whichproduced both an interim report (Institute forSocial Analysis, 1993) and summary, cross-site,and case study final reports (Roehl et al., 1995b,1996). What We Do Next: Rigorous Process Evaluation Process evaluation (also known as implementation evaluation and program monitoring) has alwaysbeen considered an integral part of comprehensiveprogram evaluation. It is clear that such studies \"areessential to understanding and interpreting impactfindings. Knowing what took place is required in order to explain or hypothesize why a program did or did not work\" (Rossi and Freeman, 1993).In short, it is useless to know whether somethingworks or not if you do not know what thatsomething is. Process evaluations also serve tostrengthen impact results concerning theory versus program failure: If no or negative impact was observed, was it due to a wrongheaded programtheory or to weak implementation? Process evaluation can also serve independently as program assessment, providing information regard-ing its form, scope, and value to practitioners and to policymakers considering adoption and/or expansion of the program. A broad view of process evaluationis needed in which comprehensive process evalua-What Do We Do Next? Research Questions and Implications for Evaluation Design 100 \u00e4 \u00e4tions include rigorous, unbiased measurement and the assessment of immediate and short-term out-comes. Process evaluations need to include baselinemeasures, prepare for future impact assessments, andfully understand the program or policy being imple-mented. The line between process and impact evalu- ation should be blurred. Comprehensive evaluations should include multiple measurements over time\u2014before, during, and after the major program interven-tions are in place\u2014to tap community perceptionsand neighborhood changes. In essence, comprehen-sive process evaluations should be pre/during/post studies with rigorous, multiple assessments in one site, with no control or comparison group. Theyshould begin when the program is merely a gleamin an agency's eye. It would be foolhardy to suggest that rigorous im- pact evaluations are not needed, but given \"kitchen sink\" programs with the community as the unit of analysis, impact results will always be disputed.No matter how rigorous the design\u2014with matchedcomparison neighborhoods, surveys in all experi-mental and comparison neighborhoods withrandomly selected respondents, crime mapping, etc.\u2014there will always be questions of attribution. Even if random assignment of programs to commu-nities could be achieved (a tall order), matchesbetween communities will never be perfect, andimpact methods provide few ways to determinewhich facets of these multifaceted interventions can be linked to specific outcomes. With crime mapping, researchers are beginning to hone in on displacement, even in place-basedresearch. Yet I argue that displacement is more amark of success than failure, and spending pre-cious research dollars on its measurement may be unwarranted in some situations. In the simplest example, in recent years many problem-solvingefforts within urban communities have focused oneliminating crack houses. Process evaluation willindicate how the crack house problem was tackled,whether the crack house remains active or not, and whether the community partnership and capacity- building efforts are enough to keep the problematbay. If the crack house is gone, the problem-solving activities can move on to the next crackhouse or neighborhood.Process evaluations, however, do need to be more useful and rigorous than many currently are. Rigor-ous process evaluation methods should include: 1. New, improved, and cost-effective methods to tap community perceptions. Community surveys,whether by phone or in person, are increasingly difficult to implement, particularly in high-crime, distrustful communities. Yet the community'sperceptions are critical, and the following shouldbe considered: a. The use of computerized telephone systems for quick, frequent surveying. Oakland, California, for example, has installed a new system to automatically send messages tohouseholds; other cities have similar systemsfor the relaying of neighborhood watch mes-sages. Oakland's system can be used for com-puterized surveying, with residents responding to multiple choice items with touchtone phones. b. The use of small group methods, such as key informant surveys, community leader inter-views, and focus and discussion groups. Addi-tional research is needed on the relative cost, value, and results of such techniques compared with traditional community survey methods. 2. Unobtrusive measures. Most of our traditional measures\u2014surveys, focus groups, calls for ser-vice, reported crime, etc.\u2014are subject to errorsof measurement, reactivity, and bias. We need to develop and test innovative measures for assessing changes in crime, drug problems,and neighborhoods. One form of unobtrusive measures currently in use in community-based and place-based re-search (Mazerolle et al., in press; Taylor, 1997) is the objective observation and measurement of social and physical changes in the neighbor-hood, including the licit or illicit use of publicplaces, graffiti, trash, and level of parapherna-lia. These measures are worthy of further useand study. Additional unobtrusive measures to consider include hair analysis through anony- mous collection by barber shops and beautysalons to assess community drug use over timeand the use of traditional attitude measurementdevices such as the lost letter technique.Jan Roehl 101\u00e4\u00e43. The routine collection of process data in a stan- dard manner in cross-site process evaluations.Within a strong case study design with multiplemeasures over time, numerous methods of datacollection should be used, including stakeholderinterviews, collection of program documents, in- terviews with residents and businessowners, ob- servation of program events, collection of routineprocess data (level of services, numbers of targetgroups reached, etc.), and collection of routineimpact data on immediate outcomes (see below). 4. Immediate and short-term outcome assessments. These outcomes\u2014for example, the closing of a crack house\u2014may be considered process orimpact measures, but I argue firmly that theybelong in rigorous process evaluations. Theyserve to assess program coverage and the poten-tial for longer term impact. In the Weed and Seed program, for example, the process evaluation reported the number of arrests in the program'sfirst year and the status of their prosecution\u2014necessary immediate outcomes before the suc-cessful impact of weeding can reasonably beexpected\u2014and the funding, types, and levels of seeding activities\u2014necessary to know before the impact of seeding can be judged. 5. Timely reporting of process results. Swift report- ing of process information, preferably on an in-terim basis accompanied by review and commentby program staff and policymakers, is needed. The Federal Role Federal agencies, particularly those within theOffice of Justice Programs, have been very support-ive of evaluation research in the past decade. Asany researcher is likely to do, I advocate increasedfunding for evaluation, particularly increasedsupport for process evaluations. The tendency over the past decade has been toward rigorous impact- oriented experimental designs\u2014applying thedesigns of the laboratory to field research\u2014which,as I have argued in this paper, are not easily appliedto community research, nor do they guard againstongoing questions about \"kitchen sink\" programs and their effects.In addition to funds, the Federal Government has much to offer in developing evaluation methodsandmeasures and providing technical assistance tocommunities in evaluation research. For national,multisite programs such as Weed and Seed andComprehensive Communities, I suggest that a national evaluation model be implemented. Under this model, coordinated Federal support would beprovided to national and local evaluators. The localevaluations would be given substantial onsite re-search support for data collection, and they wouldbeconducted under the guidance of a national evalu- ator and advisory board. The national evaluator would develop common instruments and procedures;validate local data collection; provide assistance inevaluation methods and local customization; andcomplete cross-site data collection, analysis, andreporting. Such a national evaluation model leads to routine, standard data collection and improved cross-site comparisons for both process and impactevaluations as well as enabling local sites to get theinformation they need. Finally, useful evaluation research must be pro- duced and disseminated in a timely manner. Process results can guide local programs in fine-tuning and redirecting their efforts and provide information topolicymakers concerning expansion, replication,and support. The Federal Government can assistthis process by supporting rapid disseminationthrough electronic and print media. References Bratton, W.
