Three main types of fossil fuels are [coal](/Coal), [oil](/Oil), and [natural gas](/Natural_gas). These fuels are formed depending the amount of animal and plant matter, how long it has been underground, and the temperature and pressure applied to the matter over time. Fossil fuels are combustible and release energy when they are burned. They are reformulated into gasoline, diesel fuel, and heating oil. Additionally, they are burned to generate electricity. From 1900 to 2015, fossil fuels accounted for at least 80 percent of total U.S. energy consumption, according to the [U.S. to brown sedimentary rock composed of [hydrocarbons](/Hydrocarbons). After coal is mined, it is readily combustible and thus can be used as an energy source without any refining, unlike petroleum. Coal use in the United States increased throughout the 19th century as coal replaced wood as a source of fuel. Trains and steamships in the 19th century began using coal to power their boilers. By 1875, coke (a substance made from coal) replaced charcoal in steel-making. Beginning in the 1880s, coal was used to generate electricity. [[8]](#cite_note-8) [[9]](#cite_note-9) [Petroleum](/Petroleum) (also known as [crude oil](/Crude_oil)) is a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbons in liquid form. After it is extracted, crude oil is used as a transportation fuel, a heating source for buildings, a source of electricity generation, road oil, and a resource used to make plastics and other synthetic materials. The first U.S. petroleum well was drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859. The Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company of Connecticut was established to drill for oil around Titusville, Pennsylvania, after oil was found floating on the surface of a nearby body of water. In 1867, John D. Rockefeller established in 1867 what would become the Standard Oil Company. The Standard Oil Company became the largest oil refining company in Pennsylvania by 1870. By 1880, the United States accounted for 85 percent of global oil production. [[10]](#cite_note-10) [[11]](#cite_note-11) [Natural gas](/Natural_gas) is burned to generate electricity, heat buildings, fuel vehicles, heat water, and power furnaces in industrial facilities. Throughout the 19th century, natural gas was used primarily as lamp fuel. In 1855, Robert Bunsen invented the Bunsen burner, a device that combines natural gas with certain levels of air to produce hotter flames. The burner was a forerunner of gas-powered stoves and furnaces. Beginning in the 1940s, natural gas pipeline construction increased as construction became more economical. [[12]](#cite_note-12) [[13]](#cite_note-13) Uses of fossil fuel [Coal](/Coal)is primarily used to generate electricity. Coal is burned to produce steam, which powers turbines to generate electricity. In 2015, coal accounted for 33 percent of total U.S. electricity generation. Other industries use coal and coal byproducts. Steelmakers bake coal in furnaces to produce coke, which is used to produce iron and thus steel. Concrete and paper producers burn coal to generate heat. Coal is also turned into gases or liquids for use as fuel or in chemical processing. [[14]](#cite_note-14) [Natural gas](/Natural_gas)is used to generate electricity, produce heat, and manufacture products. Power plants burn natural gas to generate electricity, and larger industrial facilities use natural gas for heating as well as producing chemicals and fertilizers. Homes use natural gas to heat buildings and water, to cook food, and to dry clothes. Businesses and commercial buildings burn natural gas for refrigeration, cooling, and outdoor lighting. Natural gas can also be used as a vehicle fuel if it is compressed or liquified. [[15]](#cite_note-15) [[16]](#cite_note-16) [Petroleum](/Petroleum)is refined into fuel, such as gasoline, and other petroleum products. As of 2015, gasoline was the main petroleum product used in the United States and accounted for approximately 47 percent of total U.S. petroleum consumption. A 42-gallon barrel of crude oil is refined to produce approximately 19 gallons of gasoline for use as an engine fuel in motor vehicles. Other petroleum products include distillate fuels, such as diesel fuel and heating oil, and hydrocarbon gas liquids (HGLs), which include propane, ethane, and butane. Diesel engines in trains, boats, trucks, buses, construction equipment, and electricity generators burn diesel fuel for energy. Heating oil is burned in boilers and furnaces to produce heat for homes, businesses, and industrial facilities. HGLs can be used at natural gas processing plants, oil refineries, and in the petrochemical industry. One type of HGL, propane, is burned for space and water heating, cooking, crop drying, and clothes drying. [[17]](#cite_note-Organic_origins_of_petroleum-17) [[18]](#cite_note-18) Reserves As of 2015, the United States had 477 billion short tons of demonstrated [coal](/Coal) reserves, 32.3 billion barrels of proven [crude oil](/Crude_oil) reserves, and 388.8 trillion cubic feet of proven [natural gas](/Natural_gas) reserves.
