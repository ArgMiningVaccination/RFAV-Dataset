Lisa is the mastermind behind All Natural Ideas. She is a full-time engineer who has become passionate about sharing information on how to live a healthier life by following a natural based diet low in carbohydrates.\" But Lisa does not just do 'low carb', she recently also ventured into the realm of immunisation - but, as conventional immunisations are not 'natural', it had to be 'homeopathic immunisations. This is what she writes: Homeopathic immunizations... is increasing in popularity. Parents like the idea of protecting their child from disease without potentially toxic vaccine ingredients... Critics contend that no conclusive double-blind, randomized controlled trials have proven, in general, homeopathy's efficacy, as well as homeopathic immunizations. But proponents of homeoprophylaxis contend that conventional vaccines are also lacking in critical scientific studies that prove the long-term safety of pharmaceutical-grade vaccines. Dr. Isaac Golden is a homeopath and earned the first ever PhD in homeopathic research from a mainstream Australian University. Golden has been a pioneer in the field of homeopathic prophylaxis since 1984. His [research website](http://www.homstudy.net/Research/), offers historical evidence, epidemic studies, and his own 20-year study of over 2,000 children whose parents used his prophylaxis program, the latter of which, Golden concluded, proved over 92% effective at preventing disease... Homeopathy is a holistic form of medicine. Rather than a conventional doctor spending little time with a patient analyzing symptoms, homeopathy is considered effective when administered by a classically-trained homeopath, who will meet with the patient for well over an hour, getting the whole picture of the patient (hence 'holistic') , i.e. diet, stress levels, and many other factors. About 200 years ago, Hahnemann developed an immunization based on his 'like treats like' principle, for scarlet fever. Homeoprophylaxis, the homeopathic vaccine alternative, prevents disease through nosodes. END OF QUOTE Yes, homeopaths tend to promote a whole lot of untruths to advise their patients against immunisations and instead recommend homeopathic immunisations or 'homeo-prophylaxis'. This normally entails the oral administration of homeopathic remedies, called nosodes. Nosodes were added to the homeopathic Materia Medica only in the 1830s and are not in agreement with Hahnemann's like cures like theory. Nosodes are potentised remedies based on pathogenic material like bodily fluids or pus. In 2015, the [Canadian Paediatric Society](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Canadian+Paediatric+Society%2C+nosodes) issued the following caution: 'There is scant evidence in the medical literature for either the efficacy or safety of nosodes, which have not been well studied for the prevention of any infectious disease in humans.' There is no good evidence that any form of homeoprophylaxis is effective. After conventional immunisations, patients develop immunity against the infection in question which can be monitored by measuring the immune response to the intervention. No such evidence exists for homeopathic immunisations. More importantly, there is also no clinical data to show that homeoprophylaxis might work. Despite this lack of evidence, some homeopaths - particularly those without medical training - continue to recommend this form of quackery. The promotion of this approach constitutes a serious risk for public health: once rates for conventional immunisations fall below a certain threshold, the population would lose its herd immunity, subsequently even those individuals who were immunised are at risk of acquiring the infection. I am afraid, there can be only one conclusion: Homeoprophylaxis is dangerous charlatanry. "}
