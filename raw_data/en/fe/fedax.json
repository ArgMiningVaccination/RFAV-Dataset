Can't stop her: [Midway caterer will reopen bigger and better in Sept.](https://www.the-dispatch.com/story/news/2022/08/04/midway-caterer-reborn-opening-new-commercial-kitchen/10167426002/) Alt's second daughter was born with multiple allergies, including lactose intolerance. Alt suffered from postpartum depression. \"When my second daughter was born and was allergic to everything, I started looking at what is in our laundry detergent, soaps, shampoos and everything,\" she said. \"I began studying about holistic, healthy living and it helped.\" Fast forward to 2022, and now Alt is using her knowledge to help others with the opening of The Black Eyed Susan Apothecary at 25 W. Second Ave. She opened on July 29, using only about 400 square feet of the 1,800 square foot storefront. But there are plans for the rest of the store. Stay tuned. For now, she has shelves full of essential oils, organic protein powders and teas, vitamins, natural soaps, dried herbs, natural salt and even produce from her home garden. The natural herbs are displayed in glass jars and can be purchased by the ounce. Alt said she is not dismissive of Western medicine. After all, penicillin saves lives from illnesses that once meant death. \"There just needs to be a good balance of Western medicine and herbal medicine,\" she said. In addition to the herbs and other natural products, she wants to use the space to highlight other local vendors. For example, she carries a line of Niels Grier's wood products. The Davidson County artists make pens, coasters, bowls, wine holders, clipboards, bottle openers and more. The teas, salves and tincture she sells are from Fiddlehead Tradition Wellness in Salisbury. Customers visiting The Black Eyed Susan Apothecary will notice large curtains at what appears to the the end of the store's sales floor. Those are temporary placeholders hiding the construction happening behind the curtains, however. She and her husband, who owns Country Roads Handy Man and Hauling, are building the future of the store in the back. First, they are building a room for an esthetician. \"I have a line of products I would love to carry for customers, but I need a licensed esthetician,\" she said. \"We could offer facials and other services. This could also be a place for a massage therapist.\" In addition, Alt wants to build a juice bar and lounge area in the back and expand the salesfloor to carry more holistic, natural products. Once complete, the juice bar will offer cold-pressed juices made with fruits and vegetables. \"There's nothing like this around here,\" said Alt, who is a former waitress at Sophie's Cork and Ale and former manager at Sapona Ridge Grille. The businesswoman realizes not everyone is educated about all the natural remedies, salves, plant-based proteins and other items she carries, nor are they familiar with all the terms. Alt was once unfamiliar with the products she sells and the lifestyle she lives. She had the help of her dad, and herbalist, to guide her on her journey. She doesn't want anyone to not come into her store because they may be intimated. Alt said she is happy to help guide people through the healthy living maze. \"I really want to be a store where my customers can come look at things and feel comfortable,\" she said. \"I want them to find a comfortable medium with Western medicine and ways and being holistic.\" More: ['Wheely' good food coming out the front window of new food truck, Wheely Hungry](https://www.the-dispatch.com/story/news/2022/08/03/wheely-hungry-food-truck-opens-lexington-and-travel/10204450002/) More: [Restaurant report card: July 2022 restaurant health inspections](https://www.the-dispatch.com/story/news/2022/08/02/davidson-county-restaurants-earn-grades-92-100-during-inspections-lexington-thomasville-denton/10167660002/) - Jill Doss-Raines is The Dispatch trending topics and personality profiles senior reporter and is always looking for tips about businesses and entertainment events, secret and new menu items, and interesting people in Davidson County.
