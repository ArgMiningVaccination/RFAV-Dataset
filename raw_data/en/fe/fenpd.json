Vaccine History COVID-19 is a crisis in northern Michigan and we're counting on your help. Scheduling your first vaccine as soon as you can or a booster dose if you're already immunized is the fastest way to end this pandemic. Remember, community immunity from vaccines is the best defense we have against serious diseases like the flu, whooping cough, and COVID-19. Eliminating Diseases Immunity from vaccines has helped us eradicate the smallpox virus and nearly eliminate polio. Cases of measles and tetanus are also at an all-time low. That's because vaccines make these infectious diseases preventable. Although it's good to be informed of your health choices, the data is clear. The benefits of vaccines far outweigh the risks for the vast majority of our population. The Benefits Outweigh the Risks Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines under the most intense safety monitoring in history. Serious adverse side effects are incredibly rare. COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective, and authorized for ages five and up. In the rare chance of infection, there is no better way to reduce your risk of hospitalization and serious illness. If you have questions or concerns, please speak with your primary care provider.
