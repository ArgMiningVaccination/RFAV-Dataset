Brown, Rod Bonello and Henry Pollard Chiropract J Aust 2008 38: 18-26 Abstract: Objectives: The authors of this manuscript seek to define the role, and scientific backing for the inclusion of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) principles in the chiropractic techniques know as Applied Kinesiology (AK) and Neuro-Emotional Technique (NET). A discussion of the suitability of TCM principles within the chiropractic profession is also presented. Data Sources: A search through the electronic databases Medline, Meditext, Pubmed, OVID, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library was performed for the period of 1900 - 2007 using the key words Traditional Chinese Medicine, Meridian, five-element, five-phase, acupuncture, chiropractic, Applied Kinesiology, and Neuro-Emotional Technique. The results were limited to works published in English appearing in peer-reviewed journals. A hand search was then performed within the reference lists of the articles retrieved. Study Selection: Based on their relevance to the subject, 196 references were obtained. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Only those historical principles and current research findings that pertain specifically to the TCM concepts used in AK and NET have been included. Conclusions: Principles and philosophies from TCM are incorporated into the diagnostic and treatment of protocols of the chiropractic techniques AK and NET. The scientific backing for this inclusion is still evolving and it is clear that further research is required to support the placement of TCM principles and practices within these chiropractic techniques. The welcoming of TCM principles into chiropractic practice may broaden the scope of the chiropractic profession and allow chiropractors to more faithfully adhere to the biopsychosocial model of healthcare.
