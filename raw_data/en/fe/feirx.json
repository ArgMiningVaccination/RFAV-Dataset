Certain diseases have already been eradicated by rigorous vaccination campaigns, while others are hoped to be eliminated soon, such as measles and congenital rubella. Yet challenges remain. New vaccines that are being developed against existing diseases such as infections with human papillomavirus and may be developed against newly emerging diseases in the future, need to be monitored and evaluated. Some vaccines are still underutilised. Although vaccination has become increasingly safe and effective, one of the major challenges we face is opposition in the population against immunisation. We may have become too used to the benefits of vaccination, some diseases now being so rare that we do not even remember how devastating their consequences can be. Immunisation programmes are threatened by insufficient information, by unsubstantiated rumours about adverse effects, or by groups that, for religious or other reasons, are opposed to vaccination. Communication of the correct scientific facts it is therefore important to enable both policy makers and the public to make an informed choice.

[ ](/en/cholera) Cholera Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused bacterium Vibrio cholera of serogroups O1 or O139. Humans are the only relevant reservoir, even though Vibrios can survive for a long time in coastal waters contaminated by human excreta.Read more [ ](/en/congenital-rubella-syndrome) Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) Congenital rubella is the infection of a foetus with rubella virus following the infection of the mother during pregnancy. 'Congenital' indicates that the foetus also becomes infected during pregnancy.Read more [ ](/en/covid-19) COVID-19 See all information on COVID-19, situation updates, risk assessments, questions and answers, latest evidence, surveillance and laboratory guidance and how to protect yourself and others.Read more [ ](/en/cryptosporidiosis) Cryptosporidiosis Cryptosporidia are intestinal parasites infecting a variety of animals (e.g. cattle, sheep, rodents, cats and dogs, but also birds, fish and reptiles). Human infections occur due to Cryptosporidium parvum, a species that also affects domestic animals.Read more [ ](/en/diphtheria) Diphtheria Most people with diphtheria will have a respiratory tract infection, with a sore throat and low-grade fever in the first few days of the illness.Read more [ ](/en/hepatitis-b) Hepatitis B Hepatitis B is a liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is spread through contact with infected body fluids or blood products.Read more [ ](/en/human-papillomavirus) Human papillomavirus Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer after breast cancer to affect women aged 15-44 years in the European Union. Each year, there are around 33 000 cases of cervical cancer in the EU, and 15 000 deaths. The primary cause of cervical cancer is a persistent infection of the genital tract by some specific types of human papillomavirus (HPV).Read more [ ](/en/invasive-haemophilus-influenzae-disease) Invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease type b (Hib) is an obligate human pathogen and an important cause of invasive bacterial infections in both children and adults, with the highest incidence among young children.Read more [ ](/en/invasive-pneumococcal-disease) Invasive pneumococcal disease Despite good access to effective antibiotics, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci) is still a major cause of disease and death in both developing and developed countries.Read more [ ](/en/japanese-encephalitis) Japanese encephalitis The Japanese encephalitis virus is present in Asia, from Japan to India and Pakistan, and outbreaks are erratic and spatially and temporally limited phenomena, occurring quite unpredictably, even if all conditions appear to be present in a definite place. It is a leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia, with 30-50,000 cases reported annually. Most human infections are asymptomatic. On average, one person in 200 infected develops a severe neuroinvasive illness. The case fatality rate in patients with severe disease is 20- 30%Read more [ ](/en/measles) Measles Measles is an acute, highly contagious viral disease capable of causing epidemics. Infectivity is close to 100% in susceptible individuals and in the pre-vaccine era measles would affect nearly every individual during childhood.Read more [ ](/en/meningococcal-disease) Meningococcal disease Meningococcal disease is caused by Neisseria meningitidis, a bacterium with human carriers as the only reservoir. It is carried in the nose, where it can remain for long periods without producing symptoms.Read more [ ](/en/mumps) Mumps Mumps is an acute illness caused by the mumps virus. It is characterised by fever and swelling of one or more salivary glands (mumps is the only cause of epidemic infectious parotitis).Read more [ ](/en/pertussis-whooping-cough) Pertussis (whooping cough) Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious acute respiratory infection, caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. The disease is characterised by a severe cough, which can last two months or even longer.Read more [ ](/en/poliomyelitis) Poliomyelitis Poliomyelitis, also known as polio or infantile paralysis, is a vaccine-preventable systemic viral infection affecting the motor neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). Historically, it has been a major cause of mortality, acute paralysis and lifelong disabilities but large scale immunisation programmes have eliminated polio from most areas of the world.Read more [ ](/en/rabies) Rabies Rabies is a disease caused by rabies virus (a Lyssavirus). Every year, a small number of cases of rabies is reported in Europe - travel-related or autochthonous.Read more [ ](/en/rotavirus-infection) Rotavirus infection Rotavirus infection is an acute infectious disease mainly affecting children. The main symptoms are fever, vomiting and diarrhoea and many affected children suffer from extensive fluid loss in need of medical attention. The incubation period is 1-2 days.Read more [ ](/en/rubella-german-measles) Rubella (German measles) Rubella is a mild febrile rash illness caused by rubella virus. It is transmitted from person to person via droplets (the virus is present in throat secretions). It affects mainly, but not only, children and when pregnant women are infected, it may result in malformation of the foetus. Humans are the only reservoir of infection.Read more [ ](/en/seasonal-influenza) Seasonal influenza Seasonal influenza is a preventable infectious disease with mostly respiratory symptoms. It is caused by influenza virus and is easily transmitted, predominantly via the droplet and contact routes and by indirect spread from respiratory secretions on hands etc.Read more [ ](/en/smallpox) Smallpox Smallpox was a systemic disease, officially eradicated since 1979 (WHO), caused by infection with the Variola major virus, whose only reservoir was infected humans.Read more [ ](/en/tetanus) Tetanus Tetanus is an often fatal disease, which is present worldwide. It is a consequence of a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. The main reservoirs of the bacterium are herbivores, which harbour the bacteria in their bowels (with no consequences for them) and disseminate the \"spore form\" of the bacteria in the environment with their faeces.Read more [ ](/en/tuberculosis) Tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious infectious disease that can be fatal. It most commonly affects the lungs.Read more [ ](/en/typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever) Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fever Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are systemic diseases caused by the bacteria Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi, respectively.Read more [ by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which also causes shingles. The virus spreads through the body into the skin causing rashes to appear.Read more "}
