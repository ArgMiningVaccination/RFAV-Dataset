Studies reporting also on the mechanisms of actions of the active substance(s) investigated are encouraged. Reports must be on standardized preparations in which the ingredients are defined; elucidation of which are the active principles and which pathways they trigger is encouraged but not mandatory. The diseases investigated must be classified according to the WHO International Classification of Diseases version 11. Negative results will be considered.The Journal will not consider articles utilizing material from endangered species as categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. We welcome articles on classic TCM reporting on clinical efficacy and safety of whole preparations or single pharmacologically active substances, done with modern approaches but linked to the traditional approach of Chinese medicine. Studies reporting also on the mechanisms of actions of the active substance(s) investigated are encouraged. Only acceptable are reports on standardised preparations. The diseases investigated have to be classified according to the WHO International Classification of Diseases version 11. The Journal will not consider articles utilising material from endangered specie as categorised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Submission checklist You can use this list to carry out a final check of your submission before you send it to the journal for review. Please check the relevant section in this Guide for Authors for more details. Ensure that the following items are present:One author has been designated as the corresponding author with contact details: E-mail address Full postal address All necessary files have been uploaded: Manuscript: Include keywords All figures (include relevant captions) All tables (including titles, description, footnotes) Ensure all figure and table citations in the text match the files provided Indicate clearly if color should be used for any figures in print Graphical Abstracts / Highlights files (where applicable) Supplemental files (where applicable) Manuscript has been 'spell checked' and 'grammar checked' All references mentioned in the Reference List are cited in the text, and vice versa Permission has been obtained for use of copyrighted material from other sources (including the Internet) A competing interests statement is provided, even if the authors have no competing interests to declare Journal policies detailed in this guide have been reviewed Referee suggestions and contact details provided, based on journal requirements For further information, visit our [Support Center](https://service.elsevier.com/app/home/supporthub/publishing/). Author checklist for Original Articles The concern about the reproducibility of published results is growing in the scientific community. Pharmacological Research ?Modern Chinese medicine has thus implemented an author checklist in order to help the authors to increase the overall quality of the articles they publish with us and ensure better transparency and reproducibility of their results. The author checklist can be downloaded at [https://www.elsevier.com/__data/promis_misc/Author_checklist_PRMCM.docx](https://www.elsevier.com/__data/promis_misc/Author_checklist_PRMCM.docx) To have a detailed explanation of the reasons and the rationale behind each item please go to [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26523875](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26523875). A positive response to items 1-10 is mandatory for the further processing of the research manuscript. A negative response to the remaining items will not per se preclude the processing of the manuscript. The relevance of each item will depend on its relative relevance in the context of the manuscript, an aspect that will be evaluated by the Editor and the Reviewers, alongside the manuscript itself, to reach a fair decision. In the checklist there is also a free text area in which we ask for suggestions and advice from the authors. Pharmacological Research is not a top-down journal and we are building a community of scientists that helps enhancing the quality of the Journal; hence we will appreciate comments and feedbacks from the authors on how to improve the checklist in the next months. The checklist will not be requested for reviews. Types of articles - Original articles. Original full-length research papers that have not been published previously, except in a preliminary form, may be submitted as regular papers. - Review articles and meta-analyses. Review articles and meta-analyses are welcome but should be topical and not just an overview of the literature. - Graphical Reviews. These reviews will summarize schematically key concepts, established and novel ideas which will be accessible to a broad audience and freely downloaded as PowerPoint slides for use in teaching or conference presentations. [More information](https://www.elsevier.com/__data/promis_misc/PRMCM_Graphical Reviews_Infographic.pdf) - Letters to the Editor on relevant issues of pharmacology or commenting on the literature published in this journal or in Pharmacological Research - Modern Chinese Medicine are also welcome. Studies in humans and animals If the work involves the use of human subjects, the author should ensure that the work described has been carried out in accordance with [The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association](https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/) (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans. Following the [Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/) and inclusion of representative human populations (sex, age and ethnicity) is encouraged though not mandatory. The terms [sex and gender](https://www.who.int/gender-equity-rights/understanding/gender-definition/en/) should be used correctly. Authors should include a statement in the manuscript that informed consent was obtained for experimentation with human subjects. The privacy rights of human subjects must always be observed.All animal experiments should be carried out in accordance with [EU Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/legislation_en.htm), or the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of Laboratory animals (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised 1978) and/or those of an internationally recognised Institution. The authors should clearly indicate in the manuscript the guidelines that have been followed. Ethics in publishing Please see our information on [Ethics in publishing](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/publishing-ethics#Authors). Declaration of interest All authors must disclose any financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that could inappropriately influence (bias) their work. Examples of potential competing interests include employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, paid expert testimony, patent applications/registrations, and grants or other funding. Authors must disclose any interests in two places: 1. A summary declaration of interest statement in the title page file (if double anonymized) or the manuscript file (if single anonymized). If there are no interests to declare then please state this: 'Declarations of interest: none'. 2. Detailed disclosures as part of a separate Declaration of Interest form, which forms part of the journal's official records. It is important for potential interests to be declared in both places and that the information matches. [More information](https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/286/supporthub/publishing/). Declaration of generative AI in scientific writing The below guidance only refers to the writing process, and not to the use of AI tools to analyse and draw insights from data as part of the research process. Where authors use generative artificial intelligence (AI) and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process, authors should only use these technologies to improve readability and language. Applying the technology should be done with human oversight and control, and authors should carefully review and edit the result, as AI can generate authoritative-sounding output that can be incorrect, incomplete or biased. AI and AI-assisted technologies should not be listed as an author or co-author, or be cited as an author. Authorship implies responsibilities and tasks that can only be attributed to and performed by humans, as outlined in Elsevier's [AI policy for authors](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/publishing-ethics#Authors). Disclosure instructions Authors must disclose the use of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process by adding a statement at the end of their manuscript in the core manuscript file, before the References list. The statement should be placed in a new section entitled 'Declaration of Generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process'. This declaration does not apply to the use of basic tools for checking grammar, spelling, references etc. If there is nothing to disclose, there is no need to add a statement. Submission declaration and verification Submission of an article implies that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract, a published lecture or academic thesis, see ['Multiple, redundant or concurrent publication'](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/publishing-ethics#Authors) for more information), that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, including electronically without the written consent of the copyright-holder. To verify compliance, your article may be checked by [Crossref Similarity Check](https://www.elsevier.com/editors/perk/plagiarism-complaints/plagiarism-detection) and other originality or duplicate checking software. Preprints Please note that [preprints](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/sharing/preprint) can be shared anywhere at any time, in line with Elsevier's [sharing policy](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/sharing). Sharing your preprints e.g. on a preprint server will not count as prior publication (see ' [Multiple, redundant or concurrent publication](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/policies-and-ethics)' for more information). Preprint posting on SSRN In support of [Open Science](https://www.elsevier.com/open-science), this journal offers its authors a free preprint posting service. Preprints provide early registration and dissemination of your research, which facilitates early citations and collaboration. During submission to Editorial Manager, you can choose to release your manuscript publicly as a preprint on the preprint server [SSRN](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/ssrn) once it enters peer-review with the journal. Your choice will have no effect on the editorial process or outcome with the journal. Please note that the corresponding author is expected to seek approval from all co-authors before agreeing to release the manuscript publicly on SSRN. For more information about posting to [SSRN](https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/), please consult the [SSRN Terms of Use](https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/terms-of-use/) and [FAQs](https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/ssrn-faq/). Use of inclusive language Inclusive language acknowledges diversity, conveys respect to all people, is sensitive to differences, and promotes equal opportunities. Content should make no assumptions about the beliefs or commitments of any reader; contain nothing which might imply that one individual is superior to another on the grounds of age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, disability or health condition; and use inclusive language throughout. Authors should ensure that writing is free from bias, stereotypes, slang, reference to dominant culture and/or cultural assumptions. We advise to seek gender neutrality by using plural nouns (\"clinicians, patients/clients\") as default/wherever possible to avoid using \"he, she,\" or \"he/she.\" We recommend avoiding the use of descriptors that refer to personal attributes such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, disability or health condition unless they are relevant and valid. When coding terminology is used, we recommend to avoid offensive or exclusionary terms such as \"master\", \"slave\", \"blacklist\" and \"whitelist\". We suggest using alternatives that are more appropriate and (self-) explanatory such as \"primary\", \"secondary\", \"blocklist\" and \"allowlist\". These guidelines are meant as a point of reference to help identify appropriate language but are by no means exhaustive or definitive. Reporting sex- and gender-based analyses Reporting guidance For research involving or pertaining to humans, animals or eukaryotic cells, investigators should integrate sex and gender-based analyses (SGBA) into their research design according to funder/sponsor requirements and best practices within a field. Authors should address the sex and/or gender dimensions of their research in their article. In cases where they cannot, they should discuss this as a limitation to their research's generalizability. Importantly, authors should explicitly state what definitions of sex and/or gender they are applying to enhance the precision, rigor and reproducibility of their research and to avoid ambiguity or conflation of terms and the constructs to which they refer (see Definitions section below). Authors can refer to the [Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41073-016-0007-6) and the [SAGER guidelines checklist](https://doi.org/10.3897/ese.2022.e86910). These offer systematic approaches to the use and editorial review of sex and gender information in study design, data analysis, outcome reporting and research interpretation - however, please note there is no single, universally agreed-upon set of guidelines for defining sex and gender. Sex generally refers to a set of biological attributes that are associated with physical and physiological features (e.g., chromosomal genotype, hormonal levels, internal and external anatomy). A binary sex categorization (male/female) is usually designated at birth (\"sex assigned at birth\"), most often based solely on the visible external anatomy of a newborn. Gender generally refers to socially constructed roles, behaviors, and identities of women, men and gender-diverse people that occur in a historical and cultural context and may vary across societies and over time. Gender influences how people view themselves and each other, how they behave and interact and how power is distributed in society. Sex and gender are often incorrectly portrayed as binary (female/male or woman/man) and unchanging whereas these constructs actually exist along a spectrum and include additional sex categorizations and gender identities such as people who are intersex/have differences of sex development (DSD) or identify as non-binary. Moreover, the terms \"sex\" and \"gender\" can be ambiguous\u2014thus it is important for authors to define the manner in which they are used. In addition to this definition guidance and the SAGER guidelines, the [resources on this page](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/edi#SAGER)offer further insight around sex and gender in research studies. Changes to authorship Authors are expected to consider carefully the list and order of authors before submitting their manuscript and provide the definitive list of authors at the time of the original submission. Any addition, deletion or rearrangement of author names in the authorship list should be made only before the manuscript has been accepted and only if approved by the journal Editor. To request such a change, the Editor must receive the following from the corresponding author: (a) the reason for the change in author list and (b) written confirmation (e-mail, letter) from all authors that they agree with the addition, removal or rearrangement. In the case of addition or removal of authors, this includes confirmation from the author being added or removed. Only in exceptional circumstances will the Editor consider the addition, deletion or rearrangement of authors after the manuscript has been accepted. While the Editor considers the request, publication of the manuscript will be suspended. If the manuscript has already been published in an online issue, any requests approved by the Editor will result in a corrigendum. Article transfer service This journal uses the Elsevier Article Transfer Service to find the best home for your manuscript. This means that if an editor feels your manuscript is more suitable for an alternative journal, you might be asked to consider transferring the manuscript to such a journal. The recommendation might be provided by a Journal Editor, a dedicated [Scientific Managing Editor](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/submit-your-paper/submit-and-revise/article-transfer-service/scientific-managing-editors), a tool assisted recommendation, or a combination. If you agree, your manuscript will be transferred, though you will have the opportunity to make changes to the manuscript before the submission is complete. Please note that your manuscript will be independently reviewed by the new journal. [More information](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/submit-your-paper/submit-and-revise/article-transfer-service). Copyright Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be asked to complete a 'License Agreement' (see [more information](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/copyright) on this). Permitted third party reuse of open access articles is determined by the author's choice of [user license](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/open-access-licenses). As an author you (or your employer or institution) have certain rights to reuse your work. [More information](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/copyright).

Language (usage and editing services) Please write your text in good English (American or British usage is accepted, but not a mixture of these). Authors who feel their English language manuscript may require editing to eliminate possible grammatical or spelling errors and to conform to correct scientific English may wish to use the [Language Editing service](https://webshop.elsevier.com/language-editing/) available from Elsevier's Language Services. Submission Our online submission system guides you stepwise through the process of entering your article details and uploading your files. The system converts your article files to a single PDF file used in the peer-review process. Editable files (e.g., Word, LaTeX) are required to typeset your article for final publication. All correspondence, including notification of the Editor's decision and requests for revision, is sent by e-mail. Suggesting reviewers Please submit the names and institutional e-mail addresses of several potential reviewers. You should not suggest reviewers who are colleagues, or who have co-authored or collaborated with you during the last three years. Editors do not invite reviewers who have potential competing interests with the authors. Further, in order to provide a broad and balanced assessment of the work, and ensure scientific rigor, please suggest diverse candidate reviewers who are located in different countries/regions from the author group. Also consider other diversity attributes e.g. gender, race and ethnicity, career stage, etc. Finally, you should not include existing members of the journal's editorial team, of whom the journal are already aware.Note: the editor decides whether or not to invite your suggested reviewers. Peer review This journal operates a single anonymized review process. All contributions will be initially assessed by the editor for suitability for the journal. Papers deemed suitable are then typically sent to a minimum of two independent expert reviewers to assess the scientific quality of the paper. The Editor is responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles. The Editor's decision is final. Editors are not involved in decisions about papers which they have written themselves or have been written by family members or colleagues or which relate to products or services in which the editor has an interest. Any such submission is subject to all of the journal's usual procedures, with peer review handled independently of the relevant editor and their research groups. [More information on types of peer review](https://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/what-is-peer-review). Article structure Introduction State the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background, avoiding a detailed literature survey or a summary of the results. Material and methods Provide sufficient details to allow the work to be reproduced by an independent researcher. Methods that are already published should be summarized, and indicated by a reference. If quoting directly from a previously published method, use quotation marks and also cite the source. Any modifications to existing methods should also be described. Results Results should be clear and concise. Discussion This should explore the significance of the results of the work, not repeat them. A combined Results and Discussion section is often appropriate. Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published literature. Appendices If there is more than one appendix, they should be identified as A, B, etc. Formulae and equations in appendices so on. Similarly for tables and figures: Table A.1; Fig. A.1, etc. Highlights Highlights are optional yet highly encouraged for this journal, as they increase the discoverability of your article via search engines. They consist of a short collection of bullet points that capture the novel results of your research as well as new methods that were used during the study (if any). Please have a look at the [example Highlights](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/highlights). Structured abstract A structured abstract, by means of appropriate headings, should provide the context or background for the research and should state its purpose, basic procedures (selection of study subjects or laboratory animals, observational and analytical methods), main findings (giving specific effect sizes and their statistical significance, if possible), and principal conclusions. It should emphasize new and important aspects of the study or observations. Keywords Immediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 6 keywords, using American spelling and avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts (avoid, for example, 'and', 'of'). Be sparing with abbreviations: only abbreviations firmly established in the field may be eligible. These keywords will be used for indexing purposes. Acknowledgements Collate acknowledgements in a separate section at the end of the article before the references and do not, therefore, include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise. List here those individuals who provided help during the research (e.g., providing language help, writing assistance or proof reading the article, etc.). Formatting of funding sources List funding sources in this standard way to facilitate compliance to funder's requirements: Funding: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [grant numbers xxxx, yyyy]; the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA [grant number zzzz]; and the United States Institutes of Peace [grant number aaaa].It is not necessary to include detailed descriptions on the program or type of grants and awards. When funding is from a block grant or other resources available to a university, college, or other research institution, submit the name of the institute or organization that provided the funding. If no funding has been provided for the research, it is recommended to include the following sentence:This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. Units Follow internationally accepted rules and conventions: use the international system of units (SI). If other units are mentioned, please give their equivalent in SI. Footnotes Footnotes should be used sparingly. Number them consecutively throughout the article. Many word processors can build footnotes into the text, and this feature may be used. Otherwise, please indicate the position of footnotes in the text and list the footnotes themselves separately at the end of the article. Do not include footnotes in the Reference list. Artwork Electronic artwork General points Make sure you use uniform lettering and sizing of your original artwork. Embed the used fonts if the application provides that option. Aim to use the following fonts in your illustrations: Arial, Courier, Times New Roman, Symbol, or use fonts that look similar. Number the illustrations according to their sequence in the text. Use a logical naming convention for your artwork files. Provide captions to illustrations separately. Size the illustrations close to the desired dimensions of the published version. Submit each illustration as a separate file. Ensure that color images are accessible to all, including those with impaired color vision. A detailed [guide on electronic artwork](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-schemas/artwork-and-media-instructions) is available. You are urged to visit this site; some excerpts from the detailed information are given here. Formats If your electronic artwork is created in a Microsoft Office application (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) then please supply 'as is' in the native document format. Regardless of the application used other than Microsoft Office, when your electronic artwork is finalized, please 'Save as' or convert the images to one of the following formats (note the resolution requirements for line drawings, halftones, and line/halftone combinations given below): EPS (or PDF): Vector drawings, embed all used fonts. TIFF (or JPEG): Color or grayscale photographs (halftones), keep to a minimum of 300 dpi. TIFF (or JPEG): Bitmapped (pure black & white pixels) line drawings, keep to a minimum of 1000 dpi. TIFF (or JPEG): Combinations bitmapped line/half-tone (color or grayscale), keep to a minimum of 500 dpi. Please do not: Supply files that are optimized for screen use (e.g., GIF, BMP, PICT, WPG); these typically have a low number of pixels and limited set of colors; Supply files that are too low in resolution; Submit graphics that are disproportionately large for the content. Color artwork Please make sure that artwork files are in an acceptable format (TIFF (or JPEG), EPS (or PDF), or MS Office files) and with the correct resolution. If, together with your accepted article, you submit usable color figures then Elsevier will ensure, at no additional charge, that these figures will appear in color online (e.g., ScienceDirect and other sites) regardless of whether or not these illustrations are reproduced in color in the printed version. For color reproduction in print, you will receive information regarding the costs from Elsevier after receipt of your accepted article. Please indicate your preference for color: in print or online only. [Further information on the preparation of electronic artwork](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-schemas/artwork-and-media-instructions). Figure captions Ensure that each illustration has a caption. Supply captions separately, not attached to the figure. A caption should comprise a brief title (not on the figure itself) and a description of the illustration. Keep text in the illustrations themselves to a minimum but explain all symbols and abbreviations used. References Citation in text Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in the reference list (and vice versa). Any references cited in the abstract must be given in full. Unpublished results and personal communications are not recommended in the reference list, but may be mentioned in the text. If these references are included in the reference list they should follow the standard reference style of the journal and should include a substitution of the publication date with either 'Unpublished results' or 'Personal communication'. Citation of a reference as 'in press' implies that the item has been accepted for publication. Preprint references Where a preprint has subsequently become available as a peer-reviewed publication, the formal publication should be used as the reference. If there are preprints that are central to your work or that cover crucial developments in the topic, but are not yet formally published, these may be referenced. Preprints should be clearly marked as such, for example by including the word preprint, or the name of the preprint server, as part of the reference. The preprint DOI should also be provided. References in a special issue Please ensure that the words 'this issue' are added to any references in the list (and any citations in the text) to other articles in the same Special Issue. Reference management software Most Elsevier journals have their reference template available in many of the most popular reference management software products. These include all products that support [Citation Style Language styles](https://citationstyles.org), such as [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/reference-manager/). Using citation plug-ins from these products, authors only need to select the appropriate journal template when preparing their article, after which citations and bibliographies will be automatically formatted in the journal's style. If no template is yet available for this journal, please follow the format of the sample references and citations as shown in this Guide. If you use reference management software, please ensure that you remove all field codes before submitting the electronic manuscript. [More information on how to remove field codes from different reference management software](https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/26093/). Reference style Text: Indicate references by number(s) in square brackets in line with the text. The actual authors can be referred to, but the reference number(s) must always be given. List: Number the references (numbers in square brackets) in the list in the order in which they appear in the text.

Research Elements This journal enables you to publish research objects related to your original research - such as data, methods, protocols, software and hardware - as an additional paper in a [Research Elements journal](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/tools-and-resources/research-elements-journals). Research Elements is a suite of peer-reviewed, open access journals which make your research objects findable, accessible and reusable. Articles place research objects into context by providing detailed descriptions of objects and their application, and linking to the associated original research articles. Research Elements articles can be prepared by you, or by one of your collaborators.During submission, you will be alerted to the opportunity to prepare and submit a manuscript to one of the Research Elements journals. More information can be found on the [Research Elements page](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/tools-and-resources/research-elements-journals).

The environment is similar to MS Word: in addition to editing text, you can also comment on figures/tables and answer questions from the Copy Editor. Web-based proofing provides a faster and less error-prone process by allowing you to directly type your corrections, eliminating the potential introduction of errors. If preferred, you can still choose to annotate and upload your edits on the PDF version. All instructions for proofing will be given in the e-mail we send to authors, including alternative methods to the online version and PDF. We will do everything possible to get your article published quickly and accurately. Please use this proof only for checking the typesetting, editing, completeness and correctness of the text, tables and figures.
