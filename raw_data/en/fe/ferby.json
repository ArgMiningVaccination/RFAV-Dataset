You're correct, this energy drink is USDA- [certified](https://www.usda.gov/topics/organic) organic. Furthermore, its sugar is derived from organic cane, and the caffeine is obtained from Guayusa leaves. Runa Clean Energy, made with carbonated water, organic Amazon Guayusa, citric acid, and natural tastes, delivers long-lasting energy, improves attention, and clears the mind. In this article, I'll go through the components of Runa in detail, as well as why you should limit your consumption. Nutrition Facts of Runa Clean Energy includes very few calories and a minimum amount of sugar along with a few sodiums to help you stay energized and hydrated. Ingredients of Runa Clean Energy The ingredients of Runa Clean Energy have been listed in the table below. |Ingredients||Functions| |Carbonated Water||Both young and older persons may |[including](https://www.organicfacts.net/guayusa-tea.html)the capacity to strengthen the digestive and immune systems, clean the teeth, aid in weight loss, and boost energy levels, among others.

The additional compounds in Runa Clean Energy are listed above, and you can see that it lacks B vitamins, taurine, and creatine, which are common in other energy beverages. How Much Caffeine is in Runa Clean Energy? A 250ml can of Runa Clean Energy includes 105mg of caffeine whereas a 355ml serving has 150mg. Caffeine provides the 'energy' in energy drinks. It's a [stimulant](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-caffeine) that improves mental focus, boosts brain activity, and increases alertness. [Caffeine](https://reizeclub.com/how-much-caffeine-is-in-an-energy-shot/) is widely consumed by the general public due to its energy-inducing qualities. The majority of energy drinks include synthetic caffeine, which quickly [dissolves](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/caffeine) in the bloodstream and provides a burst of energy. When this brief burst of energy wears off, though, you may feel [depleted](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/caffeine-crash#:~:text=A%20caffeine%20crash%20may%20result%20from%20a%20lack,or%20at%20least%20reduce%20%E2%80%94%20these%20productivity-killing%20effects.) and exhausted, and it's known as a [caffeine crash](https://reizeclub.com/caffeine-crash/). As a result, the Guayusa leaf, which is high in caffeine and [antioxidants](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/guayusa), is used in the Runa Clean Energy drink. This recedes the chances of a caffeine crash. Anxiety, headaches, elevated heart rate, and insomnia are [side](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/caffeine-side-effects#:~:text=9%20Side%20Effects%20of%20Too%20Much%20Caffeine%201,to%20the%20compound%E2%80%99s%20stimulatory%20effects%20on%20the%20bladder.) effects of too much caffeine. Getting too reliant on caffeinated beverages might lead to [overdosing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0379073805002057) or addiction. To be safe, stick to the caffeine intake recommendations in this research paper. To avoid unwanted side effects, healthy persons should only consume up to 400mg of caffeine [each](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much) day. How Much Sugar is in Runa Clean Energy? Each can of Runa contains 2 grams of sugar from the cane. Organic cane sugar is less processed than white sugar and keeps the original sugar flavor. It also boasts a [number](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-cane-sugar) of health benefits, including antioxidant characteristics, the ability to help with urinary difficulties, and a high concentration of vitamins and polyphenols. It also contains a lot of soluble fiber, which [might](https://www.britannica.com/plant/sugarcane) help you lose weight. Despite these advantages, cane sugar is nearly identical to any other added sugar in an energy drink. While 2g isn't much, if you're diabetic or trying to lose weight, you may find that other [sugar-free brands](https://reizeclub.com/best-sugar-free-energy-drinks/) are better suited to your needs. This research paper recommends that women should consume no [more](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/added-sugars) than 24g of sugar and men should consume no more than 36g of sugar. If you're in good health and exercise regularly, I don't see why you shouldn't have Runa Clean Energy in your diet. Cane sugar blends beautifully with the beverage and, in my opinion, is sweeter than normal sugar. Guayusa Leaf in Runa Clean Energy The Guayusa leaf is the major element of Runa Clean Energy which is an Amazonian tree that [grows](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/guayusa#:~:text=Guayusa%20%28Ilex%20guayusa%29%20is%20a%20holly%20tree%20native,guayusa%20beverages%20like%20tea%20are%20becoming%20increasingly%20popular.) to be 19 to 98 feet tall and includes caffeine and antioxidants abound in the leaves of the Guayusa tree. Guayusa tea can be made as green or black tea and has a number of health benefits, including improved metabolism and mental strength. Runa energy drinks provide a clean and healthy energy boost. Guayusa also comprises polyphenols and l-theanine, in [addition](https://sciencemeetsfood.org/guayusa-plant-of-amazonia/) to caffeine. What is Guayusa Good For? Guayusa leaves contain caffeine, which helps with mental focus and alertness. Caffeine boosts your mood and concentration, allowing you to [perform](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-979/caffeine/) at your peak mental capacity. Guayusa improves metabolism, assists weight loss, [and](https://www.verywellhealth.com/guayusa-benefits-of-caffeine-rich-tea-4103191) reduces blood sugar levels, in addition to increasing brain activity. Guayusa's antioxidant capabilities prevent oxidative stress, protecting your body from significant health [problems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0896844619301214) like heart disease. Drinking Guayusa-rich drinks late at night can disrupt your sleep schedule due to the caffeine level; therefore it's best to consume it in the morning or mid-day. Is Runa Clean Energy Bad For You? [Runa Clean Energy](https://reizeclub.com/is-runa-clean-energy-bad-for-you/) is not bad for you if consumed moderately. It usually appeals to individuals who are trying to live a healthy lifestyle, based on the amount of care paid to the beverage's contents. However, as with any energy drink, excessive consumption might have severe consequences. The caffeine content would be my biggest concern. Even if it's made from natural ingredients, which reduces the danger of jitters and other possible [side effects](https://reizeclub.com/energy-drink-side-effects/), it's still best to be safe than sorry. There are some additional sugars, but not a lot. I believe you can easily burn off the 2 grams, but if you're trying to lose weight, you should avoid Runa Clean Energy. How Much Runa Clean Energy Can You Have in a Day? You can have one to two cans of Runa Clean Energy per day. People who consume caffeine on a daily basis are often unaffected by excessive caffeine intake; thus they can easily get away with drinking two cans every day. If you're new to energy drinks, start with one can in a day and gradually increase or decrease your usage based on how your body reacts. Severe headaches, elevated blood pressure, anxiety, and [jitters](https://reizeclub.com/caffeine-jitters-simple-guide-to-feel-better/) are all [classic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/caffeine-oral-route/side-effects/drg-20137844) signs of caffeine overuse. Reduce your caffeine intake immediately if you encounter any of these symptoms. Can You Have Runa Clean Energy Every Day? You can drink Runa Clean Energy every day, but you should limit yourself to one can per day, especially if you're drinking the 355ml can. Natural components rich in energy-boosting characteristics make up Runa Clean Energy. Caffeine is the only substance to be cautious of. Caffeine overuse can cause a [variety](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#:~:text=The%20Effects%20of%20Caffeine%20on%20Your%20Body%201,your%20baby%E2%80%99s%20heart%20rate%20and%20metabolism%20to%20increase.) of health issues, including: - Nausea - Severe headache - Muscle breakdown - High blood pressure - Insomnia - Anxiety and jitters Things I Like About Runa Clean Energy - Uses organic ingredients - Doesn't use artificial sweeteners - Provides energy Things I Don't like About Runa Clean Energy - Includes a high amount of caffeine - Doesn't include any vitamins and minerals Where to Buy Runa Clean Energy? You won't have any trouble buying Runa Clean Energy. It's accessible on various online stores, including Walmart and Amazon. However, in my opinion, it can be quite costly. A 12-can pack costs roughly $46, equating to about $3.80 per can. If money isn't an issue, you should give this energy drink a try. Alternatives to Runa Clean Energy Here are some alternative [healthy energy drinks](https://reizeclub.com/best-energy-drinks-healthy/) to try. Keep an eye out for one of my personal favorites! Musashi Energy [Mushashi Energy](https://reizeclub.com/musashi-energy-drink-review/), like Runa Clean Energy, is carbonated. It comes in three varieties, all of which are delicious. The unusual aspect of its flavor is that it has a considerably sweeter aftertaste than when you're drinking it! This beverage does not appeal to me because it costs around $4 per can. I hear it contains 160mg of caffeine, beta-alanine, and B vitamins, but it's beyond my price range. Musashi, on the other hand, is a must-try if the price is not a big deal for you. Celsius Energy Drink The ginseng and guarana extract in [Celsius](https://reizeclub.com/is-celsius-on-the-go-gluten-free/) provide 200mg of caffeine. Aside from that, taurine and amino acids like l-citrulline and nitric oxide are abundant. All of these things can help to strengthen and relax your arteries, allowing for greater blood flow. For only around $21, you can get a 12-piece set. This makes it a more affordable option than Runa Clean Energy. The only thing about this drink that I don't enjoy is its high caffeine content. As a result, if you're caffeine-sensitive, you may want to stick to energy drinks with less caffeine. REIZE (My Top Pick) If you want to try the Runa Clean Energy Lime Flavor for a better taste and more bang for your buck, you can try my favorite energy drink, REIZE. B vitamins, [taurine](https://reizeclub.com/why-is-taurine-in-energy-drinks/), and inositol are just a few of the components in this energy drink. While it does not contain Guayusa leaf, it has organic caffeine found in ginseng extract. The fact that it only has 50mg of caffeine and 11 calories makes it more enticing. Its modest caffeine concentration keeps me awake and alert for hours without generating any unpleasant side effects. It also comes in convenient 4g sachets that you can carry with you everywhere you go! Make yourself a refreshing glass of REIZE whenever you want. You can get REIZE for only around $1 and you can even have your orders shipped straight to your doorstep.
