The neonatologist will approve the parent for kangaroo care when your baby is medically stable. Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP) is a special way of nurturing a baby as a whole person through the ways in which we give care. Through NIDCAP support, a baby is able to communicate needs and to play an active role in determining progress. Using the NIDCAP model of care, parents are able to understand and interpret their infant's behavior so they are able to understand their infant's needs. The Division of Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy provides oral motor / feeding and developmental evaluation and treatment for premature or fragile babies. Occupational therapists facilitate the transition from hospital to home by providing parent education about feeding and development. The Rev. Marianne Brandon is the daytime chaplain for the NICU. In addition, a chaplain from [Pastoral Care](/service/p/pastoral-care) is always on-call in the hospital, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The chaplain's role is to provide support to every family, regardless of religious affiliation or participation. It is common during times of crisis to experience questions in regard to your priorities, personal strength, relationships and beliefs. The Rev. Brandon is trained to listen to these matters of the heart, providing empathy and encouragement. Prayer, religious rituals and contacting your pastor or a representative of your faith are also services provided by the chaplain. Whatever your specific need, please feel free to ask your nurse to contact the chaplain to ensure a visit. Clergy from your own congregation are welcome and encouraged to visit you and your baby on the NICU. The Chapel of the Holy Child and the Interfaith Chapel are located on the first floor of the A building, directly across from the A information desk. The chapels are always open for meditation and prayer. Learn more about our [Bereavement Support and Grief Counseling services](/service/p/pastoral-care/bereavement). Every family is assigned a social worker and will receive contact information in the first few days of your hospitalization. Our professional licensed social workers are available in the NICU to offer support and social work services such as parenting, marital, family, financial and discharge planning. Learn more about our [Ongoing Support Resources](/patients/child/special-needs/directory). Our 50 volunteers are an integral part of the NICU during the day and evening hours. They perform many functions, primarily holding and comforting infants whose parents cannot be with them at that time. Community members are trained and supported by nurses, developmental specialists and [Child Life](/service/c/child-life) specialists to recognize behaviors that indicate when infants need and want to be held and calmed. Volunteers hold and talk softly to infants, reposition them for comfort, offer a pacifier and even read and sing softly, depending upon each infant's needs and wants. Every infant has his or her own way of interacting that is unlike anyone else; learning to understand an infant's nonverbal cues is important to understanding how to help. Responding to infants' cues for attention and interaction is especially important in the first year of life, when infants are learning how to trust their world, and their brain is growing at a rapid pace. Every experience matters to infants, and comfort and calmness are experiences that benefit infants in "}
