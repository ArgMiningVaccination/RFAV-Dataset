Under section 133C(3) of the Act , the Minister may make a personal decision to cancel a visa without notice if the Minister is satisfied that a ground for cancelling the visa under section 116 exists and the Minister is satisfied that it would be in the public interest to cancel the visa . The attached Statement of R easons sets out the Minister's decision in your case and provides particulars of the relevant information upon which his decision was made . Revoking the decision to cancel your visa The decision to cancel your visa has been made by the Minister personally. While the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) has the power to review decisions to cancel or refuse a visa made by delegates of the Minister, it cannot review decisions made by the Minister personally.

A copy of the section 133C(3) visa cancellation decision record (Statement of Reasons) is attached. Pursuant to section 133F(4), you are invited to make representations to the Minister about the possible revocation of his decision to cancel your visa.

Representatives of the Australian Government, including the Prime Minister, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Home Affairs, have repeatedly stated to the public that Mr Djokovic would be subject to the sam e rules as everyone else, and that there would be no special treatment to Mr Djokovic.1 4 As it turns out, however, there is no 'rule' that required Mr Djokovic to be 'fully vaccinated' in order to enter Australia. Mr Djokovic held a Subclass 408 visa, tha t was granted to him on 18 November 2021, that granted him positive permission to travel to and enter Australia: section 29 of the Act. Mr Djokovic was thereby entitled to enter Australia, unless his visa was lawfully cancelled. It was purportedly cancelle d by a delegate of the Minister for Home Affairs under section 116(1)(e)(i) of the Act in the early hours of 6 January 2022 but, as the 1 \"[T]here should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all.

They have provided him with an exemption to come to Australia, and so we then act in accordance with that decision. ... Well, that's how it works. States provide exemptions for people to enter on those basis (sic), and that's been h appening for the last two years. So there's no change to that arrangement. The Victorian Government made their decision on that. And so I'd have to refer to the Victoria Government about their reasons for doing so. Thank you. 6 The fact that Mr Morrison then , just over an hour after the delegate made the unlawful cancellation decision in the early hours of 6 January 2022, tweeted as follows: Mr Djokovic's visa has been cancelled. Rules are rules, especially when it comes to our borders . No one is above these rules. ... suggests that this is driven by politics, not law. In particular, there are no 'rules' whatsoever that Mr Djokovic breached by coming to Australia. 7 It is the Minister for Home Affairs, rather than Mr Djokovic, that did not follow the 'rules'. The Minister for Home Affairs has conceded that the actions of her delegates were unreasonable. Following that concession, it is remarkable that the Minister for Immigration now seeks to engage his personal discretionary powers to cancel Mr Djokovic's visa, e ven though there is no 'rule' Mr Djokovic has not complied with . Indeed, as the evidence in the Court proceeding now concluded clearly shows, Mr Djokovic reasonably believed that he had every requisite permission from both the Federal and State governments to enter. 8 It is even more remarkable that the Minister for Immigration is considering mak ing a decision under section 133C (3) (a process under which Mr Djokovic has no right to natural justice ), rather than to make a decision under section 133C(1) (a process in which Mr Djokovic would have a right to be heard before the decision is made) . No justification has been offered for this extraordinary approach. 9 We have grave concerns that any cancellation decision would involve illegality, including but not l imited to improper purpose . 10 Having made those observations, we now address the law and the evidence . The documents referenced in this letter have recently been provided to you. Section 133C(3) 11 Section 133C(3) requires the Minister for Immigration to be s atisfied both that: (a) a ground for cancelling the visa under section 116 exists; and (b) it would be in the public interest to cancel the visa.

Risk to public health and safety - section 116(1)(e) (i) 13 As you are aware, Mr Djokovic recently tested positive for COVID -19 on 16 December 2021 and subsequently tested negative for COVID -19 on 22 December 2021 . Evidence of the test results have been provided to you . 14 Mr Djokovic poses a negligible threat of infection to others. Further, the risk of Mr Djokovic infecting others is less than, or at the very least comparable to, that of any other person who is lawfully entitled to enter Australia in accordance with section 3(a) of the Biosecurity (Entry Requirements \u2014Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Determination 2021 (Determination ). 15 There is a substantial body of medical evidence that demonstrates that persons who have been recently infected with COVID -19 have immunity to re -infection that is higher than that, or at least equal to that, of those who have been vaccinated.2 16 Indeed, ATAGI, in its guidance issued on 14 December 2021, accepts that natural immunity follows from SARS -Cov-2 infection. Further, in the same guidance, ATAGI states that 'evidence suggests that past infection reduces the risk of reinfection for at least six months'. 2 Dan, Jennifer M., et al. \"Immunological memory to SARS -CoV-2 assessed for up to eight months after infection.\" BioRxiv (2020).

If the Minister purports to find that he is, he should expect to be subjected to a searching cross -examination as to his purported basis for this purport ed finding. Evidence of medical contraindication - Determination 3(b) 20 There is evidence that vaccination following recent infection may result in more severe adverse side effects.6 Dr John O'Horo, M.D., a leading infec tious di seases physician at Mayo Clinic, is quoted as saying: '...those vaccinated shortly after recovery may mount a more robust immune response to the COVID -19 vaccine. This could cause stronger side effects '.7 21 There is evidence that adults vaccinated af ter recent COVID -19 infection have suffered adult multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS -A).8 22 Again, Mr Djokovic has previously produced evidence of recent COVID -19 infection and recovery. 23 Mr Djokovic has accordingly demonstrated that he is a person who is at risk of suffering more severe adverse side effects from vaccination, because he has been recently infected with COVID -19. This is , plainly, a medical contraindication. 3 Abu-Raddad, Laith J., et al. \"SARS -CoV-2 antibody -positivity protects against reinfection for at with efficacy.\" EClinicalMedicine (2021): 100861.

ATTACHMENT A DocuSign Envelope ID: \u00a9 Hall & 11 January 2022 5 33913327_1 Definition of 'medical contraindication' within the meaning of the Determination 24 An observation is made in respect of the potential broader policy implications if a dispute in respect of the proposed visa cancellation is to be further adjudicated on the merits. 25 The Determination requires to provide evidence of 'medical contraindication '. That term is not defined by the Biosecurity Act 2015 or the Determination. It bears its ordinary meaning. 26 In particular, the Determination does not require evidence of some severe or absolute medical contraindication (such as high risk of adverse react ion, or risk of severe adverse consequences) . The Minister would be in error to interpret the Determination so. 27 It would be open, and indeed correct, for Mr Djokovic to contend that the proper interpretation of the Determination is to provide evidence of any medical contraindication that is applicable to the visa holder. 28 For the reasons set out above, there is a body of medical evidence of medical contraindication against vaccination for those who have been recently infected with COVID -19. 29 Additionally, however, there is ample evidence that there are risks of adverse side effects arising from vaccination against COVID -19 generally ,9 and an abundance of cases where adverse side effects have been reported. Those general risks must fall within the definitio n of a 'medical contraindication' to vaccination. Those risks apply to Mr Djokovic. 30 Were a Court to apply the above interpretation of the Determination (as would be contended by Mr Djokovic), there could be much broader and unintended national policy consequences to the classes of persons falling within cl 3(b) of the Determination. Such consequences are not intended by Mr Djokovic - he merely wishes to play in a professional sporting event as a professional sportsperson, and has no interest in shaping Australia's national policy - however it is a consequence that may well flow from such a judicial challenge if the visa cancellation is pressed. 31 In those circumstances, it is clear that the preferable outcome for all parties involved would be to allow Mr Djokovic to remain in Australia for the duration of his visa, as he is entitled to. Publ ic interest 32 As set out above, Mr Djokovic poses no risk to public health and safety. He has also made no attempt to contravene any laws of Australia. He is a person of good standing, and a diplomat of the nation of Serbia. In addition to being the best ten nis player in the world, he is known for his philanthropic efforts, including his generous donations towards coronavirus relief as well as towards Australian bushfire relief. 33 There is vocal support in Australia and abroad for Mr Djokovic to remain in Aust ralia and play in the Australian Open 2022. For example: (a) an online poll from the Age shows support for Mr Djokovic remaining in Australia at 60% (screenshot attached) ; & Wilcox 11 January 2022 6 33913327_1 (b) an online petition for Mr Djokovic to be freed to play in the Australian Open has gathered over 83,000 signatures (at the time of this letter).10 34 There are several matters that would go against the public interest if the Australian Government were to make a second attempt to cancel Mr Djokovic's visa. 35 First, that action would be likely to (further) adversely affect Australia's global reputation, and call into question Australia's border security principles and policies - and indeed the rule of law in Australia generally . 36 Secondly, that action would prejudice Australian economic interes ts, and jeopardise the viability of Australia continuing to host this prestigious, international sporting event . 37 Thirdly, that action would create the appearance of politically motivated decision -making. 38 Cancelling Mr Djokovic's visa and deporting him would plainly be adverse to the public interest, and respectfully, could only serve political interests. The Minister for Immigration cannot be satisfied that there is any public interest in cancelling Mr Djo kovic's visa. Availability for cross -examination 39 Should the Minister for Immigration purport to cancel Mr Djokovic's visa under s ection 133C(3), we hold instructions to immediately apply to the Courts for relief. Further, we have instructions to seek an u rgent (almost immediate) final trial. Judge Kelly is already well - familiar with issues in the case, including the proper interpretation of the ATAGI guidelines. 40 In the meantime, w e request that you take all appropriate steps to ensure that the Minister is available for cross -examination at short notice in the event that the Minister purports to cancel Mr Djokovic's visa. We anticipate that, if such a decision be made, then proceedings will be commenced forthwith, and that we will ask the Court to conduct a n urgent final hearing, and to issue a subpoena to the Minister to attend to give evidence at that hearing. Undertaking 41 Finally, we confirm the undertaking received from the AGS that: (a) AGS will notify both Mr Djokovic's legal representatives and Judge Kell y's chambers within 30 minutes of the Minister for Immigration making any purported cancellation decision ; and (b) there will be no attempt to remove Mr Djokovic for 24 hours after notification. Specifically, we ask that this notification be done by: (a) telephone call to Natalie Bannister on 0409 418 259; and (b) email to Mr Djokovic's solicitors: Ms Bannister and Graydon Dowd; Paul Holdenson QC, Nick Wood Hall & Wilcox 11 January 2022 7 33913327_1 We invite you to consider the above matters and contact us for any further information required. Mr Djokovic and his advisors also remain open to discuss the terms of his stay in Australia, should that assist the Minister. Yours faithfully Hall & Wilcox ATTACHMENT A DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC ATAGI expanded guidance on acute major medical conditions that warrant a temporary medical exemption relevant for COVID -19 vaccines Updated: 26 November 2021 The below guidance is prepared to support completion of the Australian Immunisation Register immunisation medical exemption (IM011) form, Guidelines for imm unisation medical exemption . This advice covers those for whom an exemption can be provided and does not cover clinical management of adverse events. For the management of adverse events refer to your local Specialist Immunisation Service. Background COVID -19 vaccines have been demonstrated to be safe and effective and as such are recommended for all Australians from 12 years of age. There are very few situations where a vaccine is contraindicated and as such, medical exemption is expected to be rarely requ ired. Temporary exemptions An exemption should not be given when an alternative COVID -19 vaccine is available and when completing the medical exemption ( IM011) form all COVID -19 brands must be selected. Valid reasons for a temporary exemption include: For an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine , inflammatory cardiac illness within the past 3 months, e.g., myocarditis or pericarditis; acute rheumatic fever or acute rheumatic heart disease (i.e., with active myocardial inflammation); or acute decompensated heart failure For all COVID -19 vaccines: o Acute major medical condition (e.g. undergoing major surgery or hospital admission for a serious illness). Typically, these are time -limited conditions (or the medical treatment for them is time limited). o PCR-confirmed SARS -CoV-2 infection , where vaccination can be deferred until 6 months after the infection . Vaccinati on should be deferred for 90 days in people who have received anti-SARS -CoV-2 monoclonal antibody or convalescent plasma therapy. o Any serious adverse event attributed to a previous dose of a COVID -19 vaccine , without another cause identified , and with no a cceptable alternative vaccine available. For example a person <60 years of age, contraindicated to receive Pfizer vaccine and in whom the risks do not outweigh the benefits for receipt of AstraZeneca vaccine, is eligible for a temporary exemption. o If the v accinee is a risk to themselves or others during the vaccination pro cess they may warrant a temporary vaccine exemption. This may include a range of individuals with underlying developmental or mental health disorders , but noting that non -pharmacological interventions can safely facilitate vaccination in many individuals with behavioural ATTACHMENT A DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABCATAGI Guidance 2 disturbances and that s pecialist services may be available to facilitate the safe administration of vaccines in this population. Chronic symptoms following COVID -19 (\"Long COVID\") are not a contraindication to COVID -19 vaccines, but do warrant a clinical discussion with the patient. Pregnancy is not a valid reason for exemption in the absence of any of the criteria listed above . Assessment of serious adverse events followin g immunisation (AEFI) An adverse event is considered serious if it: requires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation OR results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity OR is potentially life -threatening . AND has been reported to a state/territory adverse event surveillance system and/or t he TGA . AND has been determined following review by, and/or on the opinion of, an experienced immunisation provider/medical specialist to be associated with a risk of recurrence of the serious adverse event if another dose is given . Assessment of an advers e event following immunisation (AEFI) requires detailed information on the event, a determination of the likelihood of a causal link with vaccination, as well as the severity of the condition. Examples of serious AEFI include: thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS) following Vaxzevria (ITP), myocarditis), potentially life -threatening events (e.g., anaphylaxis); and/or persistent or significant disability (e.g., Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome). These reactions do not include common expected local or systemic reactions known to occur within the first few days after vaccination. Attributing a serious adv erse event to a previous dose of a COVID -19 vaccine may require discussion with the individual's GP, local immunisation service or relevant medical specialist. Duration of temporary exemption Temporary exemptions for longer than 6 months are NOT recommended in the first instance, as they should be reviewed as the individual recovers from their acute major medical illness. This time limitation will allow individuals who can safely be vaccinated to be protected against COVID -19 in a timely way. It may take a few weeks for any changes to an individual's vaccine status to be updated on the AIR with regards to a temporary medical exemption . It should also be noted that an individual may not be optimally protected from COVID -19 until they have completed the recommended vaccine schedule and this temporary exemption may need to be reconsidered depending on the SARS CoV -2 epidemiology at the time. Temporary medical exemptions can only be completed by those authorised to do so [AIR medical exemption criteria], utilising their Medicare provider number .

Care of Tennis Australia of Olympic Boulevard MELBOURNE State VIC Postcode 3000 Part D Evidence 1. I am a medical practitioner with a Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery from the University of NSW, a Fellowship of the Australasian College of Sport and Exercise Medicine Physicians and a PhD from the University of Sydney. I have worked as a medical practitioner for approximately 32 years. 2. I am the Chief Medical Officer of Tennis Australia and I am authorised to swear this affidavit. 3. As part of my role at Tennis Australia, I was involved in setting up an independent expert medical review panel for the purpose of reviewing applications from players and players' support staff for medical exemptions to vaccination to attend or participate in the Australian Open tennis tournament. 4. While considering what process to adopt, the review process was discussed with the Victorian Government's Department of Health ( DoH). In addition to Tennis Australia's requirements, I understand that a person who is unvaccinated requires a medical exemption in order to enter into the State of Victoria. 5. The DoH and Tennis Australia put in place a two-step process for considering medical exemptions for unvaccinated entrants. First, the application for a medical exemption would be determined by a panel of suitably-qualified independent experts, appointed by Tennis Australia, who would either approve, reject or ask for further information for each application.

Tennis Australia appointed (MBBS, B. Med.Sci., FRACP, FTTM (RCPS Glasgow) FISTM, PhD), Professor Infectious Diseases and Virology and (MBBS, MA (Bioinf), FRACP, PhD), Infectious Disease Physician as its expert panel ( TA's Panel ). 7. If the application was approved by TA's Panel, the application would be provided to the DoH's independent panel ( DoH Panel ) which would then make its own determination. 8. I initially received a number of applications for a medical exemption to vaccination. I passed each application to one of our employees , who removed identifying information from each application to ensure that each application did not contain information which could identify the applicant. 9. TA's Panel and the DoH Panel are each tasked with determining whether each application for medical exemption met the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) guidelines on medical exemptions to vaccination. 10. On 28 December 2021, TA's Panel approved the plaintiff's medical exemption to vaccination. 11. The plaintiff's application, the subject of the TA's Panel approved exemption, was then provided to the DoH Panel. 12. The DoH Panel reviewed and endorsed the plaintiff's application for medical exemption to vaccination. 13. On 30 December 2021, I signed a letter confirming that the 2 panels had approved the plaintiff's application for medical exemption to vaccination. Annexed to this affidavit and marked 'CRB-1' is a true copy of this advice regarding medical exemption to vaccination granted to the plaintiff.

DJOKOVIC: - - - and Tennis Australia. And I might be wrong for the second one, I apologise if I am, but I know that there is the medical panel, Federal Government for sure, the second one I think it's a mix between the Victorian Government and Tennis 10 Australia, I'm not 100% sure but I can check. INTERVIEWER: That's fine. So have you got some form of documentation - - - DJOKOVIC: Yes. 15 INTERVIEWER: - - - with you documenting the exemption? DJOKOVIC: Yes. They're all here. This is the visa that was granted. That's the letter from Tennis Australia. 20 INTERVIEWER: So, who did this Australian Travel Declaration application for you?

DJOKOVIC: They provided also, I think it's for official use only, the QR codes - - - INTERVIEWER: Yes. 35 DJOKOVIC: - - - I think it's one of the next papers. Obviously everything is in the system so you, I think, electronically can also track and validate. INTERVIEWER: Ok, so this medical exemption pretty much talks about the review 40 panel from, by Tennis Australia, it doesn't talk about Federal Government? But you are sure definitely - - - DJOKOVIC: Yes, the process was, yes, the process there was two medical panels - - - 45 INTERVIEWER: Ok.

I have an email, actually my agent has the email, so I mean I can ask to electronically provide it to you via email if you want, if you need the additional information, because they, they told me that this would be sufficient for the review. 5 INTERVIEWER: Ok. Yeah that's fine, so in case we need it, I'll let you know - - - DJOKOVIC: Ok. 10 INTERVIEWER: - - - but not at the moment. We should have these documents, in case we don't have these document s, definitely we should have these documents - - - DJOKOVIC: Alright. 15 INTERVIEWER: - - - but in case we don't, I'll take a photocopy of these documents as well.

So as far as we know, you know, your medical exemption was not assessed by Federal Government, so yeah, that's what I want to chec k with you - - - 35 DJOKOVIC: Yes, so I just checked with my agent and she has provided me with the very document that I have in front of me and here it says that this , that this certificate it is a medical exemption from COVID vaccination and this certifica te for exemption has been provided by independent expert medical review panel commissioned by Tennis Australia and the decision of the panel has been reviewed and endorsed by 40 independent medical exemption review panel of the Victorian State Government - - - INTERVIEWER: Ok, so - - - DJOKOVIC: - - - and then based up on that, I received the Federal, Australian 45 Federal Government Department of Home Affairs - - - INTERVIEWER: Yep, so, when the Australian - - - DJOKOVIC : - - - travel declaration. 50 009 ATTACHMENT B DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC7 43505507 INTERVIEWER: So the Australian Travel Declaration, so previously you said to me that it was done by the government. DJOKOVIC: Yes, w ell I, I probably made a mistake, it was not the Federal Government, it was the Victorian Government that had selected the independent 5 medical panel that has reviewed together with the Australian Open, and then the Department of Home Affairs has issued the travel document declaration. INTERVIEWER: Yeah, so what I'm trying to gather here with like the Australian travel decla ration, who did this application online for you, was it - - - 10 DJOKOVIC: My agent, my agent. Yes, yes, yes. INTERVIEWER: And she would have provided information based on - - - 15 DJOKOVIC: That was based on, yes exactly, based on the, this certificate of medical exemption. INTERVIEWER: And so, because previously you stated that you had emails as well from Federal Government saying that - - - 20 DJOKOVIC: I made a, yes, I apologise and I made a mistake. INTERVIEWER: No - in case you have got the emails, we would like to see those emails. 25 DJOKOVIC: I will look for the emails and I am asking my agent and I will - so it is a Victorian Department of Health. INTERVIEWER: Ok. 30 DJOKOVIC: So, I apologise. INTERVIEWER: That's absolutely fine. 35 DJOKOVIC: Ok. INTERVIEWER: Alright, and - DJOKOVIC: Yes. 40 INTERVIEWER: You're requesting an email from? DJOKOVIC: Yes, I'm requesting just for - 45 INTERVIEWER: That's alright. Ok. DJOKOVIC: I just asked them to send, if there is an email from Federal Government, to send to me. But... this is what was provided to me, because we were, since I am participating in Tennis Australian Open that is run by Tennis Australia, 50 my communication was directl y to them because that's what the procedure that has 010 ATTACHMENT B DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC8 43505507 been , that I have been introduced to, that they have informed me that this is the way to do it. And so I have provided all my PCR, positive, negative tests, my antibodies to them and some additional information and t hen t hey have sent it to further to the Victorian independent medical panel, Victorian state government , independent medical panel. And they have reviewed it with their own Tennis Australian medical 5 panel and Victorian state, so then, as a res ult of that I was granted to access Australia with a medical exemption permission. That's the whole story basically. And I am checking if there is anything else in regards to the government, Federal Government, but as I had understood from before, the Victorian state government needs to approve. So, they need to approve, it was basically not up to Federal Government 10 when it comes to my granted access to Melbourne and to Victoria. So that's really up to the state, and that's why the process has been such, in cluded them. INTERVIEWER: That's absolutely fine, but the thing is you have come to Australia and it is pretty much governed by Federal Government. 15 DJOKOVIC: This I understand. This I understand. So do you need any additional documents from me? INTERV IEWER: Yeah, if you are claiming that you did receive emails from Federal 20 Government - - - DJOKOVIC: Ok. INTERVIEWER: - - - because, yeah, we want to give you every opportunity to 25 provide as much information as you can. DJOKOVIC: Alright. Ok so. No we did not get any emails from the Federal Government. This is what we got from the Australian Open player medical team, because they are the organisers of the event, so this is what we got. 30 INTERVIEWER: Ok, that's fine. DJOKOVIC: Sorry, I apologise. 35 INTERVIEWER: That's absolutely fine. Thank you. So I'm just going to suspend this interview once again. So the interview is being suspended at 00:52 hours. 40 011 ATTACHMENT B DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC9 43505507 TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW (Part 2 of 3) RESUMED: 3.55AM INTERVIEWER: The interview is being commenced at 3.55am. Now, Novak based 5 on the information you have provided to us I am just going to issue you a notice of intention to consider cancellation of your visa. So I'm just going to read out all the information. DJOKOVIC: I don't understand, are you cancelling my visa, or? 10 INTERV IEWER: This is a notice of intention to consider cancellation under s 116 of the Migration Act 1958. So once I serve this notice to you I will give you like, you know, 20 minutes -- or whatever if you need more time you can request that -- and you need to provide us reasons why we shouldn't cancel the visa. 15 DJOKOVIC : I mean, I am really failing to understand what else do you want me to provide to you. I have provided all the documents that Tennis Australia and Victorian government has asked me to do in the last three/four weeks, this is what we have been doing. My agent and I have been in a constant communication through 20 my agent with Tennis Australia and the Victorian state government, the medical panel. They -- whatever they asked us to do -- this is their set of rules they have provided, so they have allowed to have the medical exemption for a COVID vaccination. I applied, they approved, I just really don't know what else do you want me to say. What -- I just -- I have nothing else -- I arrived here because of these 25 documents otherwise I wouldn't have been allowed to come in. I just really don't understand what is the reason you don't allow me to enter your country -- just I mean, I have been waiting four hours and I still fail to, to understand what's the main reason -- like -- lack of what papers? Lack of what information do you need? Or? 30 INTERVIEWER: Ah yep, I am just going to read out all of the information to you and I'm going to give you a copy of this as well. So everything is in there. But yeah, I have to go through this process and then the explanation you have given me, I mean, you can give it to me after the timeframe which we give you. The 20 minutes we have to give you. 35 DJOKOVIC : So you're giving me legally 20 minutes to try to provide additional information that I don't have? At 4 o clock in the morning? I mean you kind of put me in a very awkward position where at 4 in the morning I can't call director of Tennis Australia, I can't engag e with anyone from the Victorian state government 40 through Tennis Australia. You put me in a very uncomfortable position. I don't know what else I can tell you. Everything that I was asked to do is here. INTERVIEWER: Yeah. 45 DJOKOVIC : And I wouldn't be here sitting in front of you if I wasn't complying to all the rules and regulations set by your government. I just -- I don't know why -- to me it is a little bit shocking that you are -- that you are going to give me a notice to cancel my visa based on what? 50 012 ATTACHMENT B DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC10 43505507 INTERVIEWER: Notice -- notice to consider -- like, you know, this is --- DJOKOVIC : Yes but you're telling me. You know, basically you're putting me in a position where what I can do, what is my answer to that? You're giving me 20 minutes to do what? I tell you right away I have nothing else to tell you. If you can, 5 we wait for 8 in the morning and then I can call Tennis Australia and then we can try and figure this out. But right now? They're all sleeping, I don't know. I mean I just arrive d at 1am, I don't know what else I can do at this moment. I know legally you're following -- it just doesn't make any sense. I have done everything I possibly can. Right now I can call my agent. You -- you told me not to use my phone, so I'm 10 not communicating with anybody, no one knows what's going on. We did everything we possibly can and just I really don't know what else I can tell you in this 20 minutes. INTERVIEWER: Yep ok, so do you think this is not the right time to participate in 15 the interview? And you would be participating in an interview at a later stage? Is that -- DJOKOVIC : I really -- ok -- so I really need to understand from you because you've been giving me very vague answers, or literally no answers at all, for the last four 20 hours. I mean I have been here with, three times, we suspended the interview, we are recommencing it, now you are coming back with the consideration to cancel, which I don't really understand what it means. And then you telling I have 20 minutes before you make a final call. 25 INTERVIEWER: This is the process we follow, it's a legal process which we have to follow. All the information regarding why we are considering cancelling your -- DJOKOVIC : Can you read it? Can you read me it right, please? 30 INTERVIEWER: I am going to go through this form DJOKOVIC: Ok INTERVIEWER: And it's in detail, so I'll explain it, like read out everything -- 35 DJOKOVIC: Ok INTERVIEWER: And I'll give you a copy of it as well for you to read. 40 DJOKOVIC : Alright. INTERVIEWER: And then yeah, if you have questions, yeah definitely, ask questions. 45 DJOKOVIC : Yes, I have a lot of questions that I have already asked. INTERVIEWER: Yes, yes most welcome. So I am just going to read out this notice of intention to consider cancellation under section 116 of the Migration Act 1958. 50 DJOKOVIC : Yes. 013 ATTACHMENT B DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC11 43505507 INTERVIEWER: Family name, Djokovic. Given names, Novak. Date of birth 22nd of May 1987. Nationality Serbia. Country of birth Serbia. Possible grounds for cancellation. It has come to my attention, as a delegate of the 5 Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, that there appear to be a ground for cancellation of your subclass GG408 visa granted on 18 November 2021, relying on a ground at s 116(1)(e)(i). You arrived at Melbourne airport as the holder of subclass GG408 temporary activity visa. This visa allows entry into Australia to participate in Australian open tennis tournament. During an 10 intervie w with the Australian Border Force officer you have stated you are not vaccinated against COVID -19. You have also provided a copy of medical exemption issued by Tennis Australia. This medical exemption was issued on the grounds that the visa holder has recently recovered from COVID-19. Under the Biosecurity Act 2015, there are requirements for entry into Australian territory. These requirements 15 include that international travellers make a declaration as to their vaccination status (vaccinated, unvaccinate d, or medically contraindicated). Travellers may make a declaration that they have a medical contraindication and must provide evidence of that medical contraindication provided by their medical practitioner. Previous infection with COVID -19 is not conside red a medical contraindication for COVID - 20 19 vaccination in Australia. Unvaccinated persons create a greater health risk of contracting COVID -19 and spreading COVID -19 to others, either of which will further burden the Australian health system. 25 DJOKOVIC : You tell me that. I'm sorry to interrupt but that's not true. I have been this -- this is what we -- this is what the independent medical panel of Victorian state government has stated explicitly that they -- that if you have recovered or if you have the positive test of coronavirus and negative test of coronavirus in the last six months 30 and you have a sufficient amount of antibodies, you're considered to be part of the process of getting a medical exemption. That's how I got it. I communicated direc tly with the Victorian state government, that's absolutely not true. I -- I -- we directly communicate with them and they ask me, I actually have to come back with antibodies, so that's what, this is, these are the tests that we have been provided to 35 them. And we have emailed that test, I provided it to you, you, you've read it, it's directly from the Victorian state independent medical panel. INTERVIEWER: Yes that's what I have noted, like, any medical exemption issued by Tennis Australia and Victori a. 40 DJOKOVIC : It's not only Tennis Australia, it's Tennis Australia medical panel and independent Victorian state medical panel. It's two, it's not only Tennis Australia, it's your state's medical panel that has approved that where I am at the moment. 45 INTERVIEWER: Victorian state medical panel, yep -- DJOKOVIC : Victorian state medical panel has approved my request for medical exemption and then they've sent it to the federal government and the federal government send this -- which is a travel declar ation. 50 014 ATTACHMENT B DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC12 INTERVIEWER: Travel declaration. DJOKOVIC : So it's, what you've been reading to me right now, is absolutely not accurate. 5 INTERVIEWER: Now this one is Biosecurity Act 2015, so this is like uh federal government act -- so I am not sure this is something we will look into -- as I said, let me read this out -- DJOKOVIC : Okay. 10 INTERVIEWER: And then if you want to -- DJOKOVIC : Alright. Ok. 15 INTERVIEWER: A copy of the relevant section of the Biosecurity Act 2015 is attached for your reference . The information you have provided does not show a medical contraindication to COVID -19 vaccines or evidence of that provided by a medical practitioner. 20 Unvaccinated persons create a greater health risk of contracting COVID -19 and spreading COVID -19 to others, either of which will further burden the Australian health system. Ensuring unvaccinated persons do not enter Australia is a key mechanism through which the Australian Government has slowed the spread of COVID -19 within the Australian community. 25 All visa holders, whether permanent or temporary are expected to abide by all public health directives issued by both Commonwealth and state and territory jurisdictions. A breach of these directions is considered a potential risk to the health, safety or good order of the Australian community. 30 Subject to section 116(1) of the Migration Act 1958, the Minister may cancel a visa if he or she is satisfied that the presence of its holder in Australia is or may be, or would or might be, a risk to the health, safety or good order of the Australian community or a segment of the Australian community. 35 Based on the information -- above information -- I am satisfied there appears to be a ground to consider cancelling your subclass GG-408 visa, due to you presenting a risk to the health, safety or good order of the Australian community or a segment of the Australian community. The ground is that, the Minister may cancel a visa if he or 40 she is satisfied that if its holder has not entered Australia or has so entered but not has been immigration cleared it would be liable to be cancelled under Section 116(l)(e)(i) of the Migration Act 1958. Biosecurity Act 2015 reference. (3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), the 45 declaration is a declaration of which of the following paragraphs apply to the individual -- the individual (i) has received a course of vaccinations with one or more accepted COVID -19 vaccines in accordance with a schedule for receiving that course of vaccinations that is accepted by the Therapeutic Goods Admini stration; and (ii) received the last vaccination in the course of vaccinations at least 7 days before the 50 day the relevant international flight was scheduled to commence; and (iii) can 015 ATTACHMENT B DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC13 43505507 produce evidence of the matters mentioned in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) ; (b) the individual (i) has a medical contraindication to COVID-19 vaccines; and (ii) can produce evidence provided by a medical practitioner of the matter mentioned in subparagraph (i); neither paragraph (a) nor (b) applies to the individual. 5 So I give a copy of that to you. The Migration Act 1958 gives you the opportunity to comment on the intention to consider cancellation of your visa and to give reasons why your visa should not be cancelled. Your comments could include why grounds for cancellation do not exist 10 or why you should -- why your visa should not be cancelled. You are provided -- you are invited to provide your comments at the interview. Interview will be held on 6th of Jan 2022 at Melbourne airport. If you choose not to comment, the delegate may make his/her decision based on the information available 15 to them. If your visa is cancelled you may be refused immigration clearance. You may also be detained and removed from Australia as an unlawful non-citizen under section 189 of the Migration Act 1958. The visas of any dependants may also be cancelled. 20 If your visa is cancelled, you may become subject to an exclusion period. If you are subject to an exclusion period as a result of a visa cancellation, you may be prevented from being granted various types of visas for a period of up to 3 years. You may also be prevented from making a valid application for certain classes of visa while in Australia. 25 If a decision is made not to cancel your visa you will be immigration cleared and allowed to en ter Australia. Except in the case of consideration of cancellation of a visa under regulation 2.43(2), 30 factors the delegate may take into consideration in making a decision whether to cancel your visa include (but are not limited to) the following: the p urpose of your travel to Australia; extent of compliance with the conditions of your visa; the degree of hardship which may be caused to you or your family (as per the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the best interests of any child in Australia unde r 18 years of age 35 will be considered); the circumstances in which the ground for cancellation arose; your behaviour in relation to the department, now and on any previous occasion; whether there are mandatory legal consequences to a cancellation decision. So just, the intention, the notice of intention to consider cancellation under s 116 of 40 the Migration Act 1958. I'm just going to sign it here. Sign it at 4.11. If you want to sign it? DJOKOVIC : Well, I would not want to sign this document unless I hav e some answers to my questions. 45 INTERVIEWER: Alright, yes, that's fine. DJOKOVIC : Because I have been notified thank you for that but as I told you Mr Rughiv I really don't understand how come in your system you don't have the 50 information that if you have encountered Covid and been positive on Covid in the 016 ATTACHMENT B DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC14 43505507 last six months and have the sufficient amount of antibodies and a negative test which I all provided, yo u are granted to access the country. I just -- I am really confused -- because this is what I have been getting from official Tennis Australia and Victorian government medical panels for the last three weeks 5 and four weeks. So I don't know really what to do at 4am. If you allow me to switch on my phone and make a call to my agent and try and get a hold of people from Tennis Australia cause it's 4am, obviously everyone is sleeping but this is the only thing I can do right now, because I really don't have anything else to provide to you in terms of the paperwork cause this is the focus point of why I'm here is exactly 10 what I have provided to you. What you've read to me is simply not something that has been communicated to me, so I really am a little bit surprised that I am in this situation because how am I supposed to even come to Australia if I didn't have these documents which are official documents. I need your assistance, I'm sure that you have the tests that or I'm sure that you have confirmed that I'm in the system that I 15 have been approved to have the medical exemption. So the test -- my question is how come you don't have in the system the Covid 6 months regulation for the medical exemption? INTERVIEWER: So you are telling me that the medical panel -- 20 DJOKOVIC : Yes, Victorian exemption. INTERVIEWER: So it's fine -- the 6 month thing -- it's fine -- and you will be exempted to come to Australia. 25 DJOKOVIC : Yes, exactly. INTERVIEWER: So, and that's what I have been trying to explain to you . Like, it's fine if that's what they've said. Like coming to Australia, it's a federal thing. 30 Federal government controls the ports. DJOKOVIC : Okay. INTERVIEWER: Right. So I previously I tried to explain you as well and that's 35 why I gave you oppo rtunity to provide me any correspondence which was sent by Victorian tennis authorities to the federal government. DJOKOVIC : But I can't provide you that if I have no opportunity to speak with them? 40 INTERVIEWER: Yep DJOKOVIC : I have not had right, I don't have any right, because that's the communication happening between tennis Australia, Victorian government and the 45 federal government. Me I was -- well me and my agent -- we were instructed that we can only communicate with Tennis Australia and that's it. And that's how we requested what we requested and that's the only avenue that we took so right now if you allow me to make a call and try and, you know, do something about it. I will ask my agent if she has some kind of correspondence or can get someone from Tennis 50 Australia to provide what you're looking for, but I mean when I spoke to her last this 017 ATTACHMENT B DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC15 43505507 document here is what she told me that this is the, from the Australian travel declaration, home affairs government Australia, so that's the federal government, sent it to my agent with a QR code which Australia travel has been assessed. So basically they have received all the documentation from the Victorian state government, that by the way we did not selectively, individually choose to, to 5 address it to the Victorian government, that was the procedure, we had to respect that, and comply with it, and that's what the Tennis Australia told us to do, so we sent all the documentation to Tennis Australia, medical documentation. They sent it to Victorian sta te government. First they review it within their own independent medical panel within the Tennis Australia, then they send it to independent medical 10 panel of Victorian state government. Both of these panels approved, and then Victorian state government h as communicated further with the federal government and federal government has reviewed all of the medical documentation and accepted it and granted me the access to your country, this is how I'm here. I mean, I just, I don't know what other approval do I need more to provide to you, cannot you not 15 call someone in the federal government to provide this information, or -- INTERVIEWER: When I asked you about the question about Australian travel declaration, who did the application for you, previously you s aid it was your manager who did the application for you. So -- and when I asked you what kind of documents 20 were provided -- you said the manager would know that -- am I right? DJOKOVIC : No, no, no. No, no no. You, you again, I mean --- INTERVIEWER: See the way it works -- I -- what I'm getting is like your manager 25 would have given the exemption letter which was provided by Victoria -- DJOKOVIC : No sir, no sir. INTERVIEWER: And tennis Australia with this application. 30 DJOKOVIC : Sir, just to confirm again. And I'm sorry, my manager on my own behalf has communicated only with Tennis Australia, no one else. But because the procedure was such, selected or stated or determined by the federal government and Victorian state government, they've told us that this document coming from the 35 federal state government -- federal government of Australia -- which is the document for travel documentation will come directly on her email. This is what happened. This is the only communication we've had with the foreign government. We have communicated only to tennis Australia, provided them every document that they asked for. They provided to the independent panel -- independent medical panel -- 40 and then the Victorian state government taken all t he documentation from us, from the tennis Australia, from them, and sent it to the federal government, and then the federal government said okay, fine, access granted, travel declaration, QR code, you are free to go. 45 INTERVIEWER: Okay. DJOKOVIC : And this is -- otherwise I wouldn't be flying here. There's absolutely no way I would put myself in a position to come and sit here with you and it would definitely -- I mean -- it would come to my attention or my agent or the team of 50 people around me that the six months Covid regulation was not in place. It was 018 ATTACHMENT B DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC16 43505507 absolutely in place. And I'm sure there is a way to check that, whether it is with the federal government, or Victorian government, whether it's with tennis Australia, whatever I can do to provide I will. Because I mean I made it all the way to Australia because they all made it, you know, very clear and certain to me that I have all the documentation that I possibly can provide to you. 5 INTERVIEWER: That's fine, but I need to go through this properly, and so, that's fine if you don't want to sign it, but I will still, I will make a photocopy of it, I will give it to you, so I'm just going to say you're not going to sign. 10 DJOKOVIC : So can you just explain to me whether you allow me to acquire more information through my phone with my agent? INTERVIEWER: So not at this stage, once I finish this interview I will come back and I will let you know. 15 DJOKOVIC : Okay. INTERVIEWER: And like I said, if you need more time, like if you think this is not the right time to participate in the interview because you are not able to get in touch 20 with Victorian tennis or the Victorian government -- DJOKOVIC : Yes INTERVIEWER: That's fine, we are more than willing to give you, but you know, 25 I'll speak to my bosses, and yeah -- DJOKOVIC : I mean, it's 4am, I don't know what I can do INTERVIEW ER: Yeah exactly. 30 DJOKOVIC : I guess at 8am or 7.30 or 8am I will be able, I will be able to get a hold of someone at Tennis Australia, not someone, the director of Tennis Australia, I mean, I mean, through my agent, we can call, we can get them to engage, and that they are the ones that have the contact of the medical panel, the Victorian state 35 government. I don't have, as I said, I repeat, neither myself or anybody who's in my team, my agent, has communicated directly to neither federal nor the Victorian state government, only to tennis Australia, they're the ones who have been communicated further, so that's all I can state right now. And I mean if you give me more time I can do something, but you know I don't know why, I can't do anything at this 40 moment, unless I have my phone on and I can start calling my agent and people and I don't know, maybe we can wake someone up and try to get something. INTERVIEWER: As I said, I will have to speak with my bosses and check on that. 45 DJOKOVIC : Okay. INTERVIEWER: But at this stage, if you're not willing to sign, that's fine, no issues. I'm just going to write you did not sign. And just going to put a time in here because we have to give you a minimum of ten minutes but if you request more, yeah, that's 50 fine, and in the meantime -- 019 ATTACHMENT B DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC17 43505507 DJOKOVIC : It would be great if you can in the meantime get approval if I can give somebody a call, I mean I can speak in front of you, it is no problem , I will not contact anybody else. 5 INTERVIEWER: Yes, now that's fine [inaudible]. So -- Okay. This is... Okay, so I'm just going to suspend this interview -- the interview is being suspended at 4.23am. INTERVIEWER: So the interview is being recommen ced at 4.32am. So in regards 10 to using the phone, yeah that's fine, can use the phone and yep, call whoever you want to, and then I'm going to give you like, 20 minutes and then I will come back and speak with you. The interview is being suspended at 4.33 am. INTERVIEWER: So the interview is being recommenced at 5.20am. Okay - I have 15 already served you with the notice of intention to consider cancellation and at the moment you need - what have you have advised me is that you need rest and up to 8/8.30. And that's when you would be able to talk to your solicitor again. DJOKOVIC : Yes. 20 INTERVIEWER: And get some more information. So that's absolutely fine, I have spoken with my supervisors and they're more than happy to allow you have to rest. So any mo re questions? 25 DJOKOVIC : No, no more questions for now. INTERVIEWER: So what's going to happen now, because I'm going to be finishing my shift, so this case is going to be handed over to another team. Another case officer is going to come out, and speak to you. They'll introduce themselves and 30 take it from there. DJOKOVIC : Right now, or? INTERVIEWER: Later. Because by that time I'll be finishing off. 35 DJOKOVIC : Alright: INTERVIEWER: Okay, so just to let you know. Thank you. I'm just going to suspend this interview. The interview is being suspended at 5.22am. 40 [UNKNOWN SPEAKER: [Inaudible] ] INTERVIEWER 2: Do you want to just come up to this other room for a minute? 45 DJOKOVIC : Sure, sure, sure.

INTERVIEWER 2: So you've mentioned that you want, that you didn't want to proceed with the interview now? 5 DJOKOVIC : I wanted to postpone it to 8.30 if possible, yes. INTERVIEWER 2: Look if you -- you also mentioned earlier that you didn't really have anything else you could add. 10 DJOKOVIC : But maybe I will have something in a few hours. INTERVIEW ER 2: Ok, if you don't respond then a decision might be made based on the information that's at hand now. 15 DJOKOVIC : Ok so you want to make a decision now. INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah, it's possible yeah, that decision can be made based on the information that we already have, which if you don't respond it's not going to be -- 20 DJOKOVIC : Yeah -- INTERVIEWER 2: Potentially the full -- 25 DJOKOVIC : I know you're going to cancel my visa, it's obvious. But what does that mean, in terms of, excuse me, me staying here and waiting for the lawyers to engage with -- INTERVIEWER 2: At the airport? Do you mean staying at the airport? 30 DJOKOVIC : Yes because I'm not allowed to -- just to wait for another two or three hours to see whether or not they can do something, now that's the whole idea. INTERVIEWER 2: So look, if your visa would be cancelled you wouldn't stay here, 35 you would go to a hotel in the city. DJOKOVIC : Oh okay, so I would go to the hotel. INTERVIEW ER 2: Yeah, in the city. 40 DJOKOVIC : Okay. INTERVIEW ER 2: You wouldn't be staying here at the airport. 45 DJOKOVIC : But that hotel? Is it like a Covid hotel? INTERV IEWER 2: No, it's, I don't know the name of it, it's, because if someone is refused entry into the country and currently at the moment we're not putting them into immigration detention centre, so the, I'm guessing the department has contracted 50 021 ATTACHMENT B DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC19 43505507 with the hotel to allow people in, you know, refused entry to the country to stay at the hotel there. DJOKOVIC : So does that mean I can take my bags with me? 5 INTERVIEWER 2: Yes, you can but, Serco -- you probably wouldn't have full access to. You'd have to ask Serco. DJOKOVIC : Yes, yeah. 10 INTER VIEWER 2: You'd need to ask the company that's contracted to -- you wouldn't have someone from the Australian border force at the hotel with you - DJOKOVIC : No, no I understand 15 INTE RVIEWER 2: But the company called Serco that manage that process, you'd need to ask them what their rules are about -- DJOKOVIC : So you'd cancel my visa, I'd be escorted to the hotel. 20 INTERVIEWER 2: if your visa was cancelled, you'd be escorted to the hotel by Serco. DJOKOVIC : By Serco, ok. From here. 25 INTERVI EWER 2: Yeah DJOKOVIC : And then I'd have to wait in the hotel until, for t he notice. INTERVIEWER: Yeah so what's going to happen is then we'll inform the airline, 30 like only in case the decision gets made to cancel the visa, DJOKOVIC: Okay INTERVIEWER: So once you'll go to the hotel, 35 DJOKOVIC : Yep INTERVIEWER: Which is where you're going to be staying, we'll inform the Serco, we'll inform the airline, and yeah, whenever it is like suitable, they'll find a 40 ticket for you, or like, to fly back, they'll let us know, we'll let the Serco know, and then you'll come back. INTERVIEWER 2: But in the meantime - 45 DJOKOVIC : I can stay there. INTERVI EWER 2: You can stay there, and you do what you need to do with your legal representatives. 50 022 ATTACHMENT B DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC20 43505507 DJOKOVIC : Okay, okay. Fine I have nothing to add then to the process, I mean I will just, I mean I can write on the document, what I told the both of you, if you want - INTERVIEWER 2: There are some questions about what hardship it would cause 5 you, and any complications to you -- look it's probably in your favour if you did let Sudhir ask you the questions. But, you know, if you want to say you don't want to respond, or you have nothing further that you want to add, that's your right -- DJOKOVIC : I mean you, you can ask me questions regarding the process, I mean 10 it's not an issue, I can go through that, I don't know what the questions are. INTERVIEWER: First thing is like, I just wanted to see if, what's your response to the NOIC, notice of intention to cancel, so do you have anything to say, why the visa shouldn't, why shouldn't we c onsider cancelling the visa? 15 DJOKOVIC : As I said before, I just, what I can say is, I'm surprised that there is insufficient information on the very reason why I was granted the medical exemption by Victorian state independent medical panel which confirmed that I have fulfilled the criteria to enter Australia based on, based on the criteria which they have 20 imposed which is not on the paper that you read to me and that is if you had encountered or had a positive Covid PCR test in the previous six months, and you can provide the negative PCR test and the sufficient amount of antibodies, then you are granted access and that's exactly what happened in the whole process. So we provided -- I provided medical documentation of 16 November, I was positive on 25 PCR test covid -19, 22nd I was negative. I sent the blood analysis from my antibodies and had a sufficient amount and I was granted the access to Australia and I received that documentation that supported my medical exemption and travel declaration comin g from the federal government. 30 INTERVIEWER: Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to add? DJOKOVIC: No. INTERVIEWER: No, that's fine. I'm just going to suspend this interview now. 35 The interview is being suspended at 6.14am, okay.

DJOKOVIC: - - - and Tennis Australia.

INTERVIEWER: That's fine. So have you got some form of documentation - - - DJOKOVIC: Yes. 15 INTERVIEWER: - - - with you documenting the exemption? DJOKOVIC: Yes. They're all here.

DJOKOVIC: They provided also, I think it's for official use only, the QR codes - - - INTERVIEWER: Yes. 35 DJOKOVIC: - - - I think it's one of the next papers. Obviously everything is in the system so you, I think, electronically can also track and validate. INTERVIEWER: Ok, so this medical exemption pretty much talks about the review 40 panel from, by Tennis Australia, it doesn't talk about Federal Government? But you are sure definitely - - - DJOKOVIC: Yes, the process was, yes, the process there was two medical panels - - - 45 INTERVIEWER: Ok.

So as far as we know, you know, your medical exemption was not assessed by Federal Government, so yeah, that's what I want to chec k with you - - - 35 DJOKOVIC: Yes, so I just checked with my agent and she has provided me with the very document that I have in front of me and here it says that this , that this certificate it is a medical exemption from COVID vaccination and this certifica te for exemption has been provided by independent expert medical review panel commissioned by Tennis Australia and the decision of the panel has been reviewed and endorsed by 40 independent medical exemption review panel of the Victorian State Government - - - INTERVIEWER: Ok, so - - - DJOKOVIC: - - - and then based up on that, I received the Federal, Australian 45 Federal Government Department of Home Affairs - - - INTERVIEWER: Yep, so, when the Australian - - - DJOKOVIC : - - - travel declaration. 50 009 ATTACHMENT D DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC7 43505507 INTERVIEWER: So the Australian Travel Declaration, so previously you said to me that it was done by the government. DJOKOVIC: Yes, w ell I, I probably made a mistake, it was not the Federal Government, it was the Victorian Government that had selected the independent 5 medical panel that has reviewed together with the Australian Open, and then the Department of Home Affairs has issued the travel document declaration. INTERVIEWER: Yeah, so what I'm trying to gather here with like the Australian travel decla ration, who did this application online for you, was it - - - 10 DJOKOVIC: My agent, my agent. Yes, yes, yes. INTERVIEWER: And she would have provided information based on - - - 15 DJOKOVIC: That was based on, yes exactly, based on the, this certificate of medical exemption. INTERVIEWER: And so, because previously you stated that you had emails as well from Federal Government saying that - - - 20 DJOKOVIC: I made a, yes, I apologise and I made a mistake. INTERVIEWER: No - in case you have got the emails, we would like to see those emails. 25 DJOKOVIC: I will look for the emails and I am asking my agent and I will - so it is a Victorian Department of Health. INTERVIEWER: Ok. 30 DJOKOVIC: So, I apologise. INTERVIEWER: That's absolutely fine. 35 DJOKOVIC: Ok. INTERVIEWER: Alright, and - DJOKOVIC: Yes. 40 INTERVIEWER: You're requesting an email from? DJOKOVIC: Yes, I'm requesting just for - 45 INTERVIEWER: That's alright. Ok. DJOKOVIC: I just asked them to send, if there is an email from Federal Government, to send to me. But... this is what was provided to me, because we were, since I am participating in Tennis Australian Open that is run by Tennis Australia, 50 my communication was directl y to them because that's what the procedure that has 010 ATTACHMENT D DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC8 43505507 been , that I have been introduced to, that they have informed me that this is the way to do it. And so I have provided all my PCR, positive, negative tests, my antibodies to them and some additional information and t hen t hey have sent it to further to the Victorian independent medical panel, Victorian state government , independent medical panel. And they have reviewed it with their own Tennis Australian medical 5 panel and Victorian state, so then, as a res ult of that I was granted to access Australia with a medical exemption permission. That's the whole story basically. And I am checking if there is anything else in regards to the government, Federal Government, but as I had understood from before, the Victorian state government needs to approve. So, they need to approve, it was basically not up to Federal Government 10 when it comes to my granted access to Melbourne and to Victoria. So that's really up to the state, and that's why the process has been such, in cluded them. INTERVIEWER: That's absolutely fine, but the thing is you have come to Australia and it is pretty much governed by Federal Government. 15 DJOKOVIC: This I understand. This I understand. So do you need any additional documents from me? INTERV IEWER: Yeah, if you are claiming that you did receive emails from Federal 20 Government - - - DJOKOVIC: Ok. INTERVIEWER: - - - because, yeah, we want to give you every opportunity to 25 provide as much information as you can. DJOKOVIC: Alright. Ok so. No we did not get any emails from the Federal Government. This is what we got from the Australian Open player medical team, because they are the organisers of the event, so this is what we got. 30 INTERVIEWER: Ok, that's fine. DJOKOVIC: Sorry, I apologise. 35 INTERVIEWER: That's absolutely fine. Thank you. So I'm just going to suspend this interview once again. So the interview is being suspended at 00:52 hours. 40 011 ATTACHMENT D DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC9 43505507 TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW (Part 2 of 3) RESUMED: 3.55AM INTERVIEWER: The interview is being commenced at 3.55am. Now, Novak based 5 on the information you have provided to us I am just going to issue you a notice of intention to consider cancellation of your visa. So I'm just going to read out all the information. DJOKOVIC: I don't understand, are you cancelling my visa, or? 10 INTERV IEWER: This is a notice of intention to consider cancellation under s 116 of the Migration Act 1958. So once I serve this notice to you I will give you like, you know, 20 minutes -- or whatever if you need more time you can request that -- and you need to provide us reasons why we shouldn't cancel the visa. 15 DJOKOVIC : I mean, I am really failing to understand what else do you want me to provide to you. I have provided all the documents that Tennis Australia and Victorian government has asked me to do in the last three/four weeks, this is what we have been doing. My agent and I have been in a constant communication through 20 my agent with Tennis Australia and the Victorian state government, the medical panel. They -- whatever they asked us to do -- this is their set of rules they have provided, so they have allowed to have the medical exemption for a COVID vaccination. I applied, they approved, I just really don't know what else do you want me to say. What -- I just -- I have nothing else -- I arrived here because of these 25 documents otherwise I wouldn't have been allowed to come in. I just really don't understand what is the reason you don't allow me to enter your country -- just I mean, I have been waiting four hours and I still fail to, to understand what's the main reason -- like -- lack of what papers? Lack of what information do you need? Or? 30 INTERVIEWER: Ah yep, I am just going to read out all of the information to you and I'm going to give you a copy of this as well. So everything is in there. But yeah, I have to go through this process and then the explanation you have given me, I mean, you can give it to me after the timeframe which we give you. The 20 minutes we have to give you. 35 DJOKOVIC : So you're giving me legally 20 minutes to try to provide additional information that I don't have? At 4 o clock in the morning? I mean you kind of put me in a very awkward position where at 4 in the morning I can't call director of Tennis Australia, I can't engag e with anyone from the Victorian state government 40 through Tennis Australia. You put me in a very uncomfortable position. I don't know what else I can tell you. Everything that I was asked to do is here. INTERVIEWER: Yeah. 45 DJOKOVIC : And I wouldn't be here sitting in front of you if I wasn't complying to all the rules and regulations set by your government. I just -- I don't know why -- to me it is a little bit shocking that you are -- that you are going to give me a notice to cancel my visa based on what? 50 012 ATTACHMENT D DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC10 43505507 INTERVIEWER: Notice -- notice to consider -- like, you know, this is --- DJOKOVIC : Yes but you're telling me. You know, basically you're putting me in a position where what I can do, what is my answer to that? You're giving me 20 minutes to do what? I tell you right away I have nothing else to tell you. If you can, 5 we wait for 8 in the morning and then I can call Tennis Australia and then we can try and figure this out. But right now? They're all sleeping, I don't know. I mean I just arrive d at 1am, I don't know what else I can do at this moment. I know legally you're following -- it just doesn't make any sense. I have done everything I possibly can. Right now I can call my agent. You -- you told me not to use my phone, so I'm 10 not communicating with anybody, no one knows what's going on. We did everything we possibly can and just I really don't know what else I can tell you in this 20 minutes. INTERVIEWER: Yep ok, so do you think this is not the right time to participate in 15 the interview? And you would be participating in an interview at a later stage? Is that -- DJOKOVIC : I really -- ok -- so I really need to understand from you because you've been giving me very vague answers, or literally no answers at all, for the last four 20 hours. I mean I have been here with, three times, we suspended the interview, we are recommencing it, now you are coming back with the consideration to cancel, which I don't really understand what it means. And then you telling I have 20 minutes before you make a final call. 25 INTERVIEWER: This is the process we follow, it's a legal process which we have to follow. All the information regarding why we are considering cancelling your -- DJOKOVIC : Can you read it? Can you read me it right, please? 30 INTERVIEWER: I am going to go through this form DJOKOVIC: Ok INTERVIEWER: And it's in detail, so I'll explain it, like read out everything -- 35 DJOKOVIC: Ok INTERVIEWER: And I'll give you a copy of it as well for you to read. 40 DJOKOVIC : Alright. INTERVIEWER: And then yeah, if you have questions, yeah definitely, ask questions. 45 DJOKOVIC : Yes, I have a lot of questions that I have already asked. INTERVIEWER: Yes, yes most welcome. So I am just going to read out this notice of intention to consider cancellation under section 116 of the Migration Act 1958. 50 DJOKOVIC : Yes. 013 ATTACHMENT D DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC11 43505507 INTERVIEWER: Family name, Djokovic. Given names, Novak. Date of birth 22nd of May 1987. Nationality Serbia. Country of birth Serbia. Possible grounds for cancellation. It has come to my attention, as a delegate of the 5 Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, that there appear to be a ground for cancellation of your subclass GG408 visa granted on 18 November 2021, relying on a ground at s 116(1)(e)(i). You arrived at Melbourne airport as the holder of subclass GG408 temporary activity visa. This visa allows entry into Australia to participate in Australian open tennis tournament. During an 10 intervie w with the Australian Border Force officer you have stated you are not vaccinated against COVID -19. You have also provided a copy of medical exemption issued by Tennis Australia. This medical exemption was issued on the grounds that the visa holder has recently recovered from COVID-19. Under the Biosecurity Act 2015, there are requirements for entry into Australian territory. These requirements 15 include that international travellers make a declaration as to their vaccination status (vaccinated, unvaccinate d, or medically contraindicated). Travellers may make a declaration that they have a medical contraindication and must provide evidence of that medical contraindication provided by their medical practitioner. Previous infection with COVID -19 is not conside red a medical contraindication for COVID - 20 19 vaccination in Australia. Unvaccinated persons create a greater health risk of contracting COVID -19 and spreading COVID -19 to others, either of which will further burden the Australian health system. 25 DJOKOVIC : You tell me that. I'm sorry to interrupt but that's not true. I have been this -- this is what we -- this is what the independent medical panel of Victorian state government has stated explicitly that they -- that if you have recovered or if you have the positive test of coronavirus and negative test of coronavirus in the last six months 30 and you have a sufficient amount of antibodies, you're considered to be part of the process of getting a medical exemption. That's how I got it. I communicated direc tly with the Victorian state government, that's absolutely not true. I -- I -- we directly communicate with them and they ask me, I actually have to come back with antibodies, so that's what, this is, these are the tests that we have been provided to 35 them. And we have emailed that test, I provided it to you, you, you've read it, it's directly from the Victorian state independent medical panel. INTERVIEWER: Yes that's what I have noted, like, any medical exemption issued by Tennis Australia and Victori a. 40 DJOKOVIC : It's not only Tennis Australia, it's Tennis Australia medical panel and independent Victorian state medical panel. It's two, it's not only Tennis Australia, it's your state's medical panel that has approved that where I am at the moment. 45 INTERVIEWER: Victorian state medical panel, yep -- DJOKOVIC : Victorian state medical panel has approved my request for medical exemption and then they've sent it to the federal government and the federal government send this -- which is a travel declar ation. 50 014 ATTACHMENT D DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC12 INTERVIEWER: Travel declaration. DJOKOVIC : So it's, what you've been reading to me right now, is absolutely not accurate. 5 INTERVIEWER: Now this one is Biosecurity Act 2015, so this is like uh federal government act -- so I am not sure this is something we will look into -- as I said, let me read this out -- DJOKOVIC : Okay. 10 INTERVIEWER: And then if you want to -- DJOKOVIC : Alright. Ok. 15 INTERVIEWER: A copy of the relevant section of the Biosecurity Act 2015 is attached for your reference . The information you have provided does not show a medical contraindication to COVID -19 vaccines or evidence of that provided by a medical practitioner. 20 Unvaccinated persons create a greater health risk of contracting COVID -19 and spreading COVID -19 to others, either of which will further burden the Australian health system. Ensuring unvaccinated persons do not enter Australia is a key mechanism through which the Australian Government has slowed the spread of COVID -19 within the Australian community. 25 All visa holders, whether permanent or temporary are expected to abide by all public health directives issued by both Commonwealth and state and territory jurisdictions. A breach of these directions is considered a potential risk to the health, safety or good order of the Australian community. 30 Subject to section 116(1) of the Migration Act 1958, the Minister may cancel a visa if he or she is satisfied that the presence of its holder in Australia is or may be, or would or might be, a risk to the health, safety or good order of the Australian community or a segment of the Australian community. 35 Based on the information -- above information -- I am satisfied there appears to be a ground to consider cancelling your subclass GG-408 visa, due to you presenting a risk to the health, safety or good order of the Australian community or a segment of the Australian community. The ground is that, the Minister may cancel a visa if he or 40 she is satisfied that if its holder has not entered Australia or has so entered but not has been immigration cleared it would be liable to be cancelled under Section 116(l)(e)(i) of the Migration Act 1958. Biosecurity Act 2015 reference. (3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), the 45 declaration is a declaration of which of the following paragraphs apply to the individual -- the individual (i) has received a course of vaccinations with one or more accepted COVID -19 vaccines in accordance with a schedule for receiving that course of vaccinations that is accepted by the Therapeutic Goods Admini stration; and (ii) received the last vaccination in the course of vaccinations at least 7 days before the 50 day the relevant international flight was scheduled to commence; and (iii) can 015 ATTACHMENT D DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC13 43505507 produce evidence of the matters mentioned in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) ; (b) the individual (i) has a medical contraindication to COVID-19 vaccines; and (ii) can produce evidence provided by a medical practitioner of the matter mentioned in subparagraph (i); neither paragraph (a) nor (b) applies to the individual. 5 So I give a copy of that to you. The Migration Act 1958 gives you the opportunity to comment on the intention to consider cancellation of your visa and to give reasons why your visa should not be cancelled. Your comments could include why grounds for cancellation do not exist 10 or why you should -- why your visa should not be cancelled. You are provided -- you are invited to provide your comments at the interview. Interview will be held on 6th of Jan 2022 at Melbourne airport. If you choose not to comment, the delegate may make his/her decision based on the information available 15 to them. If your visa is cancelled you may be refused immigration clearance. You may also be detained and removed from Australia as an unlawful non-citizen under section 189 of the Migration Act 1958. The visas of any dependants may also be cancelled. 20 If your visa is cancelled, you may become subject to an exclusion period. If you are subject to an exclusion period as a result of a visa cancellation, you may be prevented from being granted various types of visas for a period of up to 3 years. You may also be prevented from making a valid application for certain classes of visa while in Australia. 25 If a decision is made not to cancel your visa you will be immigration cleared and allowed to en ter Australia. Except in the case of consideration of cancellation of a visa under regulation 2.43(2), 30 factors the delegate may take into consideration in making a decision whether to cancel your visa include (but are not limited to) the following: the p urpose of your travel to Australia; extent of compliance with the conditions of your visa; the degree of hardship which may be caused to you or your family (as per the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the best interests of any child in Australia unde r 18 years of age 35 will be considered); the circumstances in which the ground for cancellation arose; your behaviour in relation to the department, now and on any previous occasion; whether there are mandatory legal consequences to a cancellation decision. So just, the intention, the notice of intention to consider cancellation under s 116 of 40 the Migration Act 1958. I'm just going to sign it here. Sign it at 4.11. If you want to sign it? DJOKOVIC : Well, I would not want to sign this document unless I hav e some answers to my questions. 45 INTERVIEWER: Alright, yes, that's fine. DJOKOVIC : Because I have been notified thank you for that but as I told you Mr Rughiv I really don't understand how come in your system you don't have the 50 information that if you have encountered Covid and been positive on Covid in the 016 ATTACHMENT D DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC14 43505507 last six months and have the sufficient amount of antibodies and a negative test which I all provided, yo u are granted to access the country. I just -- I am really confused -- because this is what I have been getting from official Tennis Australia and Victorian government medical panels for the last three weeks 5 and four weeks. So I don't know really what to do at 4am. If you allow me to switch on my phone and make a call to my agent and try and get a hold of people from Tennis Australia cause it's 4am, obviously everyone is sleeping but this is the only thing I can do right now, because I really don't have anything else to provide to you in terms of the paperwork cause this is the focus point of why I'm here is exactly 10 what I have provided to you. What you've read to me is simply not something that has been communicated to me, so I really am a little bit surprised that I am in this situation because how am I supposed to even come to Australia if I didn't have these documents which are official documents. I need your assistance, I'm sure that you have the tests that or I'm sure that you have confirmed that I'm in the system that I 15 have been approved to have the medical exemption. So the test -- my question is how come you don't have in the system the Covid 6 months regulation for the medical exemption? INTERVIEWER: So you are telling me that the medical panel -- 20 DJOKOVIC : Yes, Victorian exemption. INTERVIEWER: So it's fine -- the 6 month thing -- it's fine -- and you will be exempted to come to Australia. 25 DJOKOVIC : Yes, exactly. INTERVIEWER: So, and that's what I have been trying to explain to you . Like, it's fine if that's what they've said. Like coming to Australia, it's a federal thing. 30 Federal government controls the ports. DJOKOVIC : Okay. INTERVIEWER: Right. So I previously I tried to explain you as well and that's 35 why I gave you oppo rtunity to provide me any correspondence which was sent by Victorian tennis authorities to the federal government. DJOKOVIC : But I can't provide you that if I have no opportunity to speak with them? 40 INTERVIEWER: Yep DJOKOVIC : I have not had right, I don't have any right, because that's the communication happening between tennis Australia, Victorian government and the 45 federal government. Me I was -- well me and my agent -- we were instructed that we can only communicate with Tennis Australia and that's it. And that's how we requested what we requested and that's the only avenue that we took so right now if you allow me to make a call and try and, you know, do something about it. I will ask my agent if she has some kind of correspondence or can get someone from Tennis 50 Australia to provide what you're looking for, but I mean when I spoke to her last this 017 ATTACHMENT D DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC15 43505507 document here is what she told me that this is the, from the Australian travel declaration, home affairs government Australia, so that's the federal government, sent it to my agent with a QR code which Australia travel has been assessed. So basically they have received all the documentation from the Victorian state government, that by the way we did not selectively, individually choose to, to 5 address it to the Victorian government, that was the procedure, we had to respect that, and comply with it, and that's what the Tennis Australia told us to do, so we sent all the documentation to Tennis Australia, medical documentation. They sent it to Victorian sta te government. First they review it within their own independent medical panel within the Tennis Australia, then they send it to independent medical 10 panel of Victorian state government. Both of these panels approved, and then Victorian state government h as communicated further with the federal government and federal government has reviewed all of the medical documentation and accepted it and granted me the access to your country, this is how I'm here. I mean, I just, I don't know what other approval do I need more to provide to you, cannot you not 15 call someone in the federal government to provide this information, or -- INTERVIEWER: When I asked you about the question about Australian travel declaration, who did the application for you, previously you s aid it was your manager who did the application for you. So -- and when I asked you what kind of documents 20 were provided -- you said the manager would know that -- am I right? DJOKOVIC : No, no, no. No, no no. You, you again, I mean --- INTERVIEWER: See the way it works -- I -- what I'm getting is like your manager 25 would have given the exemption letter which was provided by Victoria -- DJOKOVIC : No sir, no sir. INTERVIEWER: And tennis Australia with this application. 30 DJOKOVIC : Sir, just to confirm again. And I'm sorry, my manager on my own behalf has communicated only with Tennis Australia, no one else. But because the procedure was such, selected or stated or determined by the federal government and Victorian state government, they've told us that this document coming from the 35 federal state government -- federal government of Australia -- which is the document for travel documentation will come directly on her email. This is what happened. This is the only communication we've had with the foreign government. We have communicated only to tennis Australia, provided them every document that they asked for. They provided to the independent panel -- independent medical panel -- 40 and then the Victorian state government taken all t he documentation from us, from the tennis Australia, from them, and sent it to the federal government, and then the federal government said okay, fine, access granted, travel declaration, QR code, you are free to go. 45 INTERVIEWER: Okay. DJOKOVIC : And this is -- otherwise I wouldn't be flying here. There's absolutely no way I would put myself in a position to come and sit here with you and it would definitely -- I mean -- it would come to my attention or my agent or the team of 50 people around me that the six months Covid regulation was not in place. It was 018 ATTACHMENT D DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC16 43505507 absolutely in place. And I'm sure there is a way to check that, whether it is with the federal government, or Victorian government, whether it's with tennis Australia, whatever I can do to provide I will. Because I mean I made it all the way to Australia because they all made it, you know, very clear and certain to me that I have all the documentation that I possibly can provide to you. 5 INTERVIEWER: That's fine, but I need to go through this properly, and so, that's fine if you don't want to sign it, but I will still, I will make a photocopy of it, I will give it to you, so I'm just going to say you're not going to sign. 10 DJOKOVIC : So can you just explain to me whether you allow me to acquire more information through my phone with my agent? INTERVIEWER: So not at this stage, once I finish this interview I will come back and I will let you know. 15 DJOKOVIC : Okay. INTERVIEWER: And like I said, if you need more time, like if you think this is not the right time to participate in the interview because you are not able to get in touch 20 with Victorian tennis or the Victorian government -- DJOKOVIC : Yes INTERVIEWER: That's fine, we are more than willing to give you, but you know, 25 I'll speak to my bosses, and yeah -- DJOKOVIC : I mean, it's 4am, I don't know what I can do INTERVIEW ER: Yeah exactly. 30 DJOKOVIC : I guess at 8am or 7.30 or 8am I will be able, I will be able to get a hold of someone at Tennis Australia, not someone, the director of Tennis Australia, I mean, I mean, through my agent, we can call, we can get them to engage, and that they are the ones that have the contact of the medical panel, the Victorian state 35 government. I don't have, as I said, I repeat, neither myself or anybody who's in my team, my agent, has communicated directly to neither federal nor the Victorian state government, only to tennis Australia, they're the ones who have been communicated further, so that's all I can state right now. And I mean if you give me more time I can do something, but you know I don't know why, I can't do anything at this 40 moment, unless I have my phone on and I can start calling my agent and people and I don't know, maybe we can wake someone up and try to get something. INTERVIEWER: As I said, I will have to speak with my bosses and check on that. 45 DJOKOVIC : Okay. INTERVIEWER: But at this stage, if you're not willing to sign, that's fine, no issues. I'm just going to write you did not sign. And just going to put a time in here because we have to give you a minimum of ten minutes but if you request more, yeah, that's 50 fine, and in the meantime -- 019 ATTACHMENT D DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC17 43505507 DJOKOVIC : It would be great if you can in the meantime get approval if I can give somebody a call, I mean I can speak in front of you, it is no problem , I will not contact anybody else. 5 INTERVIEWER: Yes, now that's fine [inaudible]. So -- Okay. This is... Okay, so I'm just going to suspend this interview -- the interview is being suspended at 4.23am. INTERVIEWER: So the interview is being recommen ced at 4.32am. So in regards 10 to using the phone, yeah that's fine, can use the phone and yep, call whoever you want to, and then I'm going to give you like, 20 minutes and then I will come back and speak with you. The interview is being suspended at 4.33 am. INTERVIEWER: So the interview is being recommenced at 5.20am. Okay - I have 15 already served you with the notice of intention to consider cancellation and at the moment you need - what have you have advised me is that you need rest and up to 8/8.30. And that's when you would be able to talk to your solicitor again. DJOKOVIC : Yes. 20 INTERVIEWER: And get some more information. So that's absolutely fine, I have spoken with my supervisors and they're more than happy to allow you have to rest. So any mo re questions? 25 DJOKOVIC : No, no more questions for now. INTERVIEWER: So what's going to happen now, because I'm going to be finishing my shift, so this case is going to be handed over to another team. Another case officer is going to come out, and speak to you. They'll introduce themselves and 30 take it from there. DJOKOVIC : Right now, or? INTERVIEWER: Later. Because by that time I'll be finishing off. 35 DJOKOVIC : Alright: INTERVIEWER: Okay, so just to let you know. Thank you. I'm just going to suspend this interview. The interview is being suspended at 5.22am. 40 [UNKNOWN SPEAKER: [Inaudible] ] INTERVIEWER 2: Do you want to just come up to this other room for a minute? 45 DJOKOVIC : Sure, sure, sure.

INTERVIEWER 2: So you've mentioned that you want, that you didn't want to proceed with the interview now? 5 DJOKOVIC : I wanted to postpone it to 8.30 if possible, yes.

INTERVIEW ER 2: Ok, if you don't respond then a decision might be made based on the information that's at hand now. 15 DJOKOVIC : Ok so you want to make a decision now. INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah, it's possible yeah, that decision can be made based on the information that we already have, which if you don't respond it's not going to be -- 20 DJOKOVIC : Yeah -- INTERVIEWER 2: Potentially the full -- 25 DJOKOVIC : I know you're going to cancel my visa, it's obvious. But what does that mean, in terms of, excuse me, me staying here and waiting for the lawyers to engage with -- INTERVIEWER 2: At the airport? Do you mean staying at the airport? 30 DJOKOVIC : Yes because I'm not allowed to -- just to wait for another two or three hours to see whether or not they can do something, now that's the whole idea. INTERVIEWER 2: So look, if your visa would be cancelled you wouldn't stay here, 35 you would go to a hotel in the city. DJOKOVIC : Oh okay, so I would go to the hotel. INTERVIEW ER 2: Yeah, in the city. 40 DJOKOVIC : Okay. INTERVIEW ER 2: You wouldn't be staying here at the airport. 45 DJOKOVIC : But that hotel? Is it like a Covid hotel? INTERV IEWER 2: No, it's, I don't know the name of it, it's, because if someone is refused entry into the country and currently at the moment we're not putting them into immigration detention centre, so the, I'm guessing the department has contracted 50 021 ATTACHMENT D DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC19 43505507 with the hotel to allow people in, you know, refused entry to the country to stay at the hotel there. DJOKOVIC : So does that mean I can take my bags with me? 5 INTERVIEWER 2: Yes, you can but, Serco -- you probably wouldn't have full access to. You'd have to ask Serco. DJOKOVIC : Yes, yeah. 10 INTER VIEWER 2: You'd need to ask the company that's contracted to -- you wouldn't have someone from the Australian border force at the hotel with you - DJOKOVIC : No, no I understand 15 INTE RVIEWER 2: But the company called Serco that manage that process, you'd need to ask them what their rules are about -- DJOKOVIC : So you'd cancel my visa, I'd be escorted to the hotel. 20 INTERVIEWER 2: if your visa was cancelled, you'd be escorted to the hotel by Serco. DJOKOVIC : By Serco, ok. From here. 25 INTERVI EWER 2: Yeah DJOKOVIC : And then I'd have to wait in the hotel until, for t he notice. INTERVIEWER: Yeah so what's going to happen is then we'll inform the airline, 30 like only in case the decision gets made to cancel the visa, DJOKOVIC: Okay INTERVIEWER: So once you'll go to the hotel, 35 DJOKOVIC : Yep INTERVIEWER: Which is where you're going to be staying, we'll inform the Serco, we'll inform the airline, and yeah, whenever it is like suitable, they'll find a 40 ticket for you, or like, to fly back, they'll let us know, we'll let the Serco know, and then you'll come back.

Fine I have nothing to add then to the process, I mean I will just, I mean I can write on the document, what I told the both of you, if you want - INTERVIEWER 2: There are some questions about what hardship it would cause 5 you, and any complications to you -- look it's probably in your favour if you did let Sudhir ask you the questions. But, you know, if you want to say you don't want to respond, or you have nothing further that you want to add, that's your right -- DJOKOVIC : I mean you, you can ask me questions regarding the process, I mean 10 it's not an issue, I can go through that, I don't know what the questions are. INTERVIEWER: First thing is like, I just wanted to see if, what's your response to the NOIC, notice of intention to cancel, so do you have anything to say, why the visa shouldn't, why shouldn't we c onsider cancelling the visa? 15 DJOKOVIC : As I said before, I just, what I can say is, I'm surprised that there is insufficient information on the very reason why I was granted the medical exemption by Victorian state independent medical panel which confirmed that I have fulfilled the criteria to enter Australia based on, based on the criteria which they have 20 imposed which is not on the paper that you read to me and that is if you had encountered or had a positive Covid PCR test in the previous six months, and you can provide the negative PCR test and the sufficient amount of antibodies, then you are granted access and that's exactly what happened in the whole process. So we provided -- I provided medical documentation of 16 November, I was positive on 25 PCR test covid -19, 22nd I was negative. I sent the blood analysis from my antibodies and had a sufficient amount and I was granted the access to Australia and I received that documentation that supported my medical exemption and travel declaration comin g from the federal government. 30 INTERVIEWER: Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to add? DJOKOVIC: No. INTERVIEWER: No, that's fine. I'm just going to suspend this interview now. 35 The interview is being suspended at 6.14am, okay.

On the assumption that Mr Djokovic tested positive for COVID - 19 on 16 December 2021, tested negative for COVID - 19 on 22 December 2021, and was asymptotic from at least 27 December 2021, and that he is unvaccinated, what is the nature and degree of risk that he may present to others? If the nature and degree of risk varies between groups or segments of people, please identify them separately a nd the nature and degree of the risk for each. Based on the assumptions above and the requirement under the Biosecurity Act for a PCR test prior to travel to Australia, we can infer that Mr Djokovic has recently been infected with and cleared SARS - CoV - 2 . As such, regardless of vaccination status, this information with consideration of the evidence around transmission supports the following: - Mr Djokovic is protected from future infection for a period of at least several months - Mr Djokovic demonstrated a negative test on the 22 December and is likely protected from interval exposures As such it can be considered that Mr Djokovic is unlikely to be infectious with SARS - CoV - 2 and as such is likely to constitute a LOW risk of transmitting SARS - CoV - 2 to others . This assessment applies to all other demographic groups. b. If Mr Djokovic presents a risk of infecting other people with COVID - 19, what if any are the risks arising from their infection with COVID - 19 and the magnitude of those risks? Based on the above assumptions it is considered that Mr Djokovic is unlikely to be infectious with SARS - CoV - 2 and as such is likely to constitute a LOW risk of transmitting SARS - CoV - 2 to others. It is noted that some segments of the population are more vulnerable to severe C OVID - 19 than others, however, given the likelihood of transmission is LOW it is UNLIKELY that an infection with the propensity to cause severe illness could occur. Thus this risk is equally assessed as LOW.

In April 2020, well before Covid vaccines were available, Djokovic said he was \"opposed to vaccination\". He later claried his position by adding that he was \"no expert\" and would keep an \"open mind\" but wanted to have \"an option to choose what's best for my body.\" During a Facebook live, he explained that he \"wouldn't want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine\" to travel or compete in tournaments. He added that he was \"curious about wellbeing and how we can empower our metabolism to be in the best shape to defend against imposters like Covid-19.\" In Djokovic's home country, where it's estimated that under half the population is fully vaccinated against Covid, his comments were criticised at the time by government epidemiologist Predrag Kon, who accused the athlete of \"creating misconceptions\". Questionable science The tennis star has a track record when it comes to questionable scienti c claims. In his book Serve to Win, Djokovic described how in 2010 he met with a nutritionist who asked him to hold a piece of bread in his le hand while he pressed down on his right arm. Djokovic claims he was much weaker while holding the bread, and cited this as evidence of gluten intolerance. And during an Instagram live, he claimed that positive thought could \"cleanse\" polluted water, adding that \"scientists have proven that molecules in water react to our emotions.\" According to Dr David Nunan, a senior researcher at the Centre for Evidence- Based Medicine at the University of Oxford, \"on the balance of probabilities it is highly unlikely that such claims are true - at least not by current conventions of scienti c theory and practice.\" Twists and turns of Djokovic's Australia mess Earlier in the pandemic, Djokovic's wife repeated a 5G conspiracy theory on Instagram - her post was given a misinformation label by the social network.

Anti-vaccine activists have rallied in support of the tennis star In Telegram groups promoting anti-vax theories, he's been portrayed as a hero and an icon of freedom of choice. Twitter users have gathered under hashtags in support of Djokovic and to call for a boycott of the Australian Open.

The Australian Government has supported immunisation and has strongly encouraged vaccination in the context of SARS - CoV - 2. Vaccination was the fifth element of Au stralia's COVID - 19 Vaccine and Treatment Strategy released in August 2020. The Strategy supports early access to, and delivery of, safe and effective COVID - 19 vaccines and treatments. It was developed to provide Australians with safe and effective vaccines under a targeted and responsive national COVID - 19 vaccination policy and immunisation program based on up - to - date health advice. COVID - 19 vaccinations provided significant protection against infection, transmission and severe disease against earlier va riants. This protection was viewed as extremely important managing transmission and also in protecting individuals, the community, health system capacity and the economy. The Omicron variant has impacted vaccine efficacy and current vaccines now provide le ss protection against infection and transmission but do continue to provide significant protection against severe disease. This protection is essential to protect individuals from severe disease and also from resultant morbidity and potential mortality. In the context of widespread community transmission and large case numbers vaccination remains essential in preventing health system overload related to presentations of people with severe COVID - 19 disease.

The fire, which broke out during a protest at the entrance to the building on Thursday, caused extensive damage to the doors and portico. There have been a series of demonstrati ons by Indigenous groups as well as elements of the anti - vaccination movement and sovereign citizen groups at Old Parliament House over the past days. On 22 December another fire was lit at the entrance by the same group of protesters. A protester posted v ideo of that fire on Instagram with the caption: \"These Doors are Coming Down Either Way\". Among the protesters are Indigenous land rights activists, anti -vaccine groups and so -called sovereign citizens. The latter is a fringe conspiracy group rooted in an tisemitism and organised around a haphazard collection of pseudo -legal beliefs broadly grouped around the notion that modern government is an illegitimate corporation. Like many other threads of conspiratorial thinking, sovereign citizens have enjoyed a co nfused renaissance during the pandemic. When footage began emerging during the early stages of Covid -19 of people asking police bizarre questions at border stops or describing themselves as a \"a living woman\" to Bunnings employees, it was largely as a result of sovereign citizen -inflected beliefs . Before the fire on Friday, a piece of paper was taped to a door at Old Parliament House labelled a \"notice of acquiescence by default\". It was addressed to, among others, \"The Australian Commonwealth de facto Corporate Administration\" and contained a garbled set of legalese mirroring sovereign citizen beliefs. Intertwined with the protesters were various fringe anti -vaccination groups as well as members of the \"freedom movement\" which has pushed anti -lockdown protests during the Covid -19 pandemic before morphing into a catch -all conspiracy movement. Attempts by el ements of the conspiracy movement to influence Indigenous groups have been well documented. As the Age has previously reported, some of those movements have been active in promoting misinformation in remote Indigenous communities. In September the Guardian revealed a group had attempted to push ivermectin into the remote regional town of Wilcannia during a Covid outbreak there. There is no evidence that ivermectin has any beneficial effect as a Covid treatment, and it may be harmful in some circumstances. Leaders of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, established in 1972, condemned the actions that led to Thursday's fire. ATTACHMENT L DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC\"The actions of such protestors conducting a 'smoking ceremony' was done so without the knowledge, consent or mandate of the embassy co uncil and traditional owners responsible for the regulation of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy,\" it said in a statement. There were claims following the fire that it may have been the result of a smoking ceremony that got out of hand, or as a result of police using pepper spray to disperse the crowd. However, footage on social media showed that the fire was well lit before police arrived at the scene, and ACT police told the Age the pepper spray used was water -based and did not contain an accelerant. Footage ta ken by protesters themselves shows many of them celebrating after the fire began to engulf the front of the building. The protests were widely condemned by political leaders. Scott Morrison said it was \"disgraceful\". \"I'm disgusted and appalled by the beha viour that would see Australians come and set fire to such a symbol of democracy in this country,\" the prime minister said on Thursday. But the Greens senator Lidia Thorpe, the party's first Indigenous representative, wrote on Twitter: \"Seems like the colo nial system is burning down. Happy New Year everyone.\" She later deleted the tweet, and the party's leader, Adam Bandt said: \"Greens don't want to see the planet burning or Old Parliament.\" However, he did not publicly criticise Thorpe nor has she apologised for the comment. Old Parliament House now houses the Museum of Australian Democracy. Its director, Daryl Karp, called the fire \"tragic\" and said damage to the building was potentially irreparable. \"To actually be closed, and to be closed because of violent protests is really tragic,\" she told the ABC on Fri day.

Jack Mahony Digital Reporter , skynews.com.au January 12 admitted to breaching Serbia's COVID -19 protocols after the Serbian Prime Minister said: \"the laws equally apply to all\". The comments came after there was speculation that the world number one had been socialising at events in Belgra de while COVID positive. On Wednesday Djokovic confirmed he had attended events in the Serbian capital after he knew he was COVID positive on Wednesday. The 34 -year -old admitted to attending an interview and photoshoot at his tennis centre in Belgrade after he had received a positive PCR test result. \"While I went home after the interview to isolate for the required period, on reflection, this was an error of judgement and I accept that I should have rescheduled this commitment,\" he wrote on Instagram. Prior to Djokovic's admission the Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic reiterated that no one was above the public health rules. \"I think it is important that everyone knows that in Serbia the laws equally apply to all and that surely n o one is allowed to breach the isolation rules as it therefore puts the health of other people in jeopardy,\" she said. Ms Brnabic reminded Serbians that the government remains \"grateful\" to Djokovic for what he is doing for the Republic of Serbia. Despite the praise she said the government will maintain that rules must be followed adding that authorities are expected to investigate whether Djokovic breached the health orders. \"There are some standards that have to be met, in this case it seems to me that if he was aware of it (the positive COVID test) then it is a clear violation of the rules,\" the Prime Minister said. \"What the sanctions are? That's what the relevant institutions will have to look into.\" According to Serbian Law \"whoever during an epidemic of a dangerous contagious disease fails to act pursuant to regulations, decisions or orders setting forth measures for its suppression or prevention\" can be punished by a fine or imprisonment by three years, News.com.au reported. The event where Djokovic appears to have breached the rules was an interview and photoshoot with French newspaper L'Equipe. In photos from the event, Djokovic appeared maskless with his reasoning for not wanting to cancel the event being because he \"didn't want to let the journalist down\". Djokovic has also faced criticism for incorrectly filling out his immigration e ntry form to Australia. ATTACHMENT N DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABCThe form asks arrivals if they have travelled in the 14 days prior to their arrival in Australia and Djokovic ticked \"no\" despite travelling from Serbia to Spain within two weeks of his flight touching down in Melbourne. In the same social media post where Djokovic admitted he breach the Serbian health orders he revealed it was his \"support team\" who filled out the form and ticked the \"incorrect box\". Djokovic went on to say the mistake was a \"human error\" as a result of \"living in c hallenging times in a global pandemic\". According to the statement Djokovic's team provided additional information to the Australian Government to \"clarify this matter\". Australia's Department of Home Affairs states that giving \"false or misleading informa tion\" on an immigration form is a \"serious offence\" that carries a maximum penalty of 12 Vaccines and His Ill-Fated Adria Tour He's monitoring his health closely in the run up to the United States Open.

Credit...Mike Lawrence/U.S.T.A. By Christopher Clarey Published Aug. 20, 2020Updated June 21, 2021 Negotiations and trans-Atlantic flight complete, Novak Djokovic was seated on the sofa of one of his hard-won concessions this week: a spacious rented home near New York City, nestled amid the trees and far from the commotion. Djokovic had just put on a shirt after sunbathing on the terrace. \"With the trees and serenity, being in this kind of environment is a blessing,\" Djokovic said on a Zoom call. \"And I'm grateful, because I've seen the hotel where the majority of players are staying. I don't want to sound arrogant or anything like that, and I know the U.S.T.A. did their best in order to provide accommodation and organize everything and organize these bubbles so the players can actually compete and come here, but it's tough for most of the players, not being able to open their window and being in a hotel in a small room.\" ATTACHMENT P DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABCIt has been a bumpy and tortuous road to staging the United States Open amid the coronavirus pandemic. Djokovic's demands and complaints \u2014 public and private \u2014 did not make it any smoother for the United States Tennis Association to facilitate the tournament. But unlike many other leading international players, including Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, Djokovic is actually here after this long and unexpected break from the tennis tour. He is still ranked No. 1 and remains a perfect 18-0 in 2020, just as he was when the pandemic-related hiatus began in March. But he was hardly a big winner during the forced off-season. He generated concern and controversy by questioning vaccination and claiming that water could be affected by human emotions. And he dented his credibility and brand by organizing the Adria Tour, a charity exhibition series in Serbia and Croatia in June that seriously lacked in social distancing and decorum, leading to a cluster of coronavirus cases. It was canceled before the finish with several leading players and some support staff testing positive. Djokovic and his wife Jelena were among them , and they isolated for two weeks with their two young children in their native city of Belgrade, Serbia. \"We tried to do something with the right intentions,\" Djokovic said of the tour. \"Yes, there were some steps that could have been done differently, of course, but am I going to be then forever blamed for doing a mistake? I mean, OK, if this is the way, fine, I'll accept it, because that's the only thing I can do. Whether it's fair or not, you tell me, but I know that the intentions were right and correct, and if I had the chance to do the Adria Tour again, I would do it again.\" Editors' Picks ATTACHMENT P DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABCCinderella by Way of Cassavetes 'All Creatures Great and Small' Returns With Even More Creatures ATTACHMENT P DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC For the Most Tender Chicken, Skip This Step Image ATTACHMENT P DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC Djokovic said he did not decide to come to the United States Open until less than a week before he arrived, after getting assurances from European governments that players would not have to quarantine as they returned for the French Open and other tournaments. Credit...Mike Lawrence/U.S.T.A. Djokovic was full of mixed emotions in this week's interview, ranging from apologetic to defiant, and said he had used the long break to deepen his connections with his family and his understanding of issues like ecology and health. \"I think this is a huge transformational phase for all of us on this planet, and I think maybe even the last wake-up call,\" he said. Djokovic said his coronavirus symptoms were mild, lasting four to five days. He said he had no fever but did have fatigue and some loss of smell and taste and sensed some loss of stamina when he initially returned to practice. But with concern mounting about the long-term health effects of the virus, Djokovic, who favors a plant-based diet and natural healing when possible, said he was closely monitoring himself and looking into long-term effects. \"I've done a CT scan of my chest, and OK, everything is clear. I've done several tests since my negative test for the coronavirus as well before coming to New York,\" he said. \"I've done my blood tests, my urine tests, my stool tests, everything that I possibly can. I'm obviously doing that prevention anyway but of course now more than ever because we don't really know what we're dealing with.\" Djokovic, traveling without his family, arrived in New York on Saturday, to \"get acclimated\" to the unusual restrictions for the tournament and \"just to be able to be OK once it's go time.\" ATTACHMENT P DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABCHe will first play in the Western & Southern Open, a combined men's and women's event that has been moved from its usual location outside Cincinnati to the U.S. Open site to create a two-tournament bubble. He will compete in singles and doubles, teaming up with his Serbian compatriot Filip Krajinovic, with his first match either Sunday or Monday. Both tournaments will be played without spectators at the U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, with players and their support staff required to be tested regularly and banned from traveling beyond their lodging and the tournament site without express permission from U.S. Open leadership. \"I was very close to not coming,\" said Djokovic, who said he decided to go to New York less than a week before he arrived and only after players were given guarantees by European governments that they would not be expected to quarantine when they traveled to Europe after the U.S. Open. \"There were a lot of uncertainties,\" he said. \"And there still are, yeah, a lot of things that are not really clear.\" He continued: \"I want to play. I mean that's why I'm here. I am personally not afraid of being in a risky, dangerous health situation for myself. If I felt that way, I most likely would not be here. I am cautious of course, and I have to be responsible and of course respect the regulations and rules and restrictions as anybody else. But things are unpredictable. Anything can happen in the tennis court or off the tennis court.\" The Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest Updates Updated Jan. 9, 2022, 3:48 p.m. ET26 minutes ago 26 minutes ago Starting later this week, some at-risk Americans become eligible for a 4th Covid shot. One week in, Mayor Adams is staying the course on N.Y.C. schools As Omicron spreads, the C.D.C. seeks to clarify its message on testing and isolation. Djokovic said his own experience with the coronavirus had not altered his views on vaccines. He has said that he would have a difficult decision to make if receiving a coronavirus vaccine became mandatory to compete on the tennis circuit. \"I see that the international media has taken that out of context a little bit, saying that I am completely against vaccines of any kind,\" he said. \"My issue here with vaccines is if someone is forcing me to put something in my body. That I don't want. For me that's unacceptable. I am not against vaccination of any kind, because who am I to speak about vaccines when there are people that have been in the field of medicine and saving lives around the world? I'm sure that there are vaccines that have little side effects that have helped people and helped stop the spread of some infections around the world.\" But Djokovic did express concern about potential issues with a coronavirus vaccine. ATTACHMENT P DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC\"How are we expecting that to solve our problem when this coronavirus is mutating regularly from what I understand?\" he said. Djokovic said the U.S.T.A.'s leadership was initially reluctant to allow players to stay in rented homes during the U.S. Open. They relented but imposed strict conditions. Djokovic must pay not only the rent but also for round-the-clock security approved and monitored by the U.S.T.A, in part to help enforce the same protocols other players are following. This is not simply the honor system. \"It's super important I made this investment because it's going to make me feel better,\" Djokovic said. \"I'm going to recover better and can actually have some outdoor time when I'm not on site.\" He has come with the maximum three team members, another concession he worked to secure from the U.S.T.A., which originally planned to restrict players to just one team member. One of Djokovic's housemates is Goran Ivanisevic, the former Wimbledon champion who is one of his coaches and also contracted the coronavirus during the Adria Tour, along with other players and coaches. To those watching from afar, that outcome seemed logical in light of the lack of safety measures. Fans were allowed in stadiums. Masks were recommended but not required. Players hugged, high-fived and even danced the limbo in close quarters in a Belgrade nightclub. \"I agree things could have been done differently with the nightclub,\" Djokovic said. \"The sponsors organized. They invited players. We felt comfortable. We had a successful event. Everybody was really happy and joyful.\" Djokovic said the tour, conceived with the idea of helping lower-ranked pro players in the former Yugoslavia during the hiatus, was organized in cooperation with national governments and tennis federations. At the time, coronavirus numbers were low in Serbia and Croatia with few societal restrictions. \"We've done everything they asked us to do, and we followed the rules from the Day 1,\" Djokovic said. The Coronavirus Pandemic: Key Things to Know Card 1 of 6 The global surge. The coronavirus is spreading faster than ever, but it appears that Omicron is milder than previous variants. Still, the latest surge in cases is causing hospitalizations in the U.S. to rise and lifesaving treatments to be rationed . Boosters. The C.D.C. endorsed Pfizer boosters for children ages 12 to 17 and said being \"up to date\" on the vaccine now included a booster . But scientists are raising concerns that \"forever boosting\" is not a viable long-term strategy. Testing. A new study suggests that two widely used at-home antigen tests may fail to detect some Omicron cases in the first days of infection. The study comes as a White House official said that the cost of rapid at-home tests would be reimbursed by insurers starting next week . ATTACHMENT P DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABCMandates under review. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments over efforts to overturn two major Biden administration policies intended to raise Covid vaccination rates: its vaccine-or-testing mandate aimed at large employers and a vaccination requirement for some health care workers. Here's a breakdown of the arguments. Around the world. In China, a city of 13 million is locked down over a handful of cases, leading to questions over how long the country's zero-Covid strategy can last . In France, President Emmanuel Macron drew criticism for saying the government should make life miserable for the unvaccinated . Staying safe. Worried about spreading Covid? Keep yourself and others safe by following some basic guidance on when to test and how to use at-home virus tests (if you can find them). Here is what to do if you test positive for the coronavirus . But Djokovic said he soon grasped that the view from abroad was very different. \"When someone from Australia or America looks at what was happening in Serbia, they're like, 'Oh my God, I mean are you crazy? What are these people doing?'\" Djokovic said. \"So I really understand.\" There was also criticism in Croatia of the tour and the Croatian tennis federation's role in managing the event. But Djokovic, who also made sizable donations with his wife to coronavirus relief efforts in Serbia and Italy, maintains the tour was still worth organizing for the funds it generated for the region. \"I don't think I've done anything bad to be honest,\" he said. \"I do feel sorry for people that were infected. Do I feel guilty for anybody that was infected from that point onward in Serbia, Croatia and the region? Of course not. It's like a witch hunt, to be honest. How can you blame one individual for everything?\" ATTACHMENT P DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC Image Djokovic said the perception that he is against vaccines \"of any kind\" is incorrect. \"My issue here with vaccines is if someone is forcing me to put something in my body.

Nadal, 34, the reigning U.S. Open men's champion, chose to prioritize the clay-court season that will closely follow the U.S. Open on the reconfigured tennis calendar. Federer, 39, does not plan to play again in 2020 after two knee surgeries this year. In New York, the rightly named Big Three will be reduced to one. \"It is strange, because these two guys are the legends of our sport and with or without crowds, they are going to be missed a lot,\" Djokovic said. But he insisted that their absence and the absence of eight other players in the men's top 100, including the 2016 U.S. Open champion Stan Wawrinka, did not diminish the significance of this tournament in his opinion because \"a super majority\" of top players will be there. Federer holds the men's record with 20 Grand Slam singles titles. Nadal has 19. Djokovic has 17, and he said the quest for 18 was \"of course\" a significant factor in his decision to cross the Atlantic. \"One of the reasons why I keep on playing professional tennis on this level is because I want to reach more heights in the tennis world,\" he said. He said Federer's Grand Slam record and men's record of 310 weeks at No. 1 remained among his primary targets. Djokovic is at 282 weeks and he could surpass Federer by March. Djokovic said he feels ready after the longest break of his career, but he doesn't know for certain. And he would have welcomed discussion about playing best-of-three sets at the U.S. Open instead of the usual best-of-five. \"Maybe in the future we should have that conversation. Because these kind of circumstances are very unusual,\" he said. His presence, however difficult to secure, is a major boost for both tournaments in New York. He has won three U.S. Opens and five of the last seven Grand Slam singles titles. The absence of the entire Big Three would have sent the asterisk debate into overdrive. \"I cannot say it's the main reason why I'm here, but it's one of the reasons,\" he said. \"First of all, I have to think about myself and my health and my fitness and whether my team is OK to be here. Once that was checked, then I of course also felt responsible as a top player to be here. It's important for our sport to keep going.\" More on Tennis and the Coronavirus Novak Djokovic Tests Positive for the Coronavirus June 23, 2020 ATTACHMENT P DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC With Simona Halep Out, U.S. Open Field Is Missing Many Top Women Aug. 17, 2020 After It All, Serena Williams Still Has No. 24 In Sight Aug. 7, 2020 Christopher Clarey has covered global sports for The Times and the International Herald Tribune for more than 25 years from bases in France, Spain and the United States.

I am a medical practitioner with a Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery from the University of NSW, a Fellowship of the Australasian College of Sport and Exercise Medicine Physicians and a PhD from the University of Sydney. I have worked as a medical practitioner for approximately 32 years. 2. I am the Chief Medical Officer of Tennis Australia and I am authorised to swear this affidavit. 3. As part of my role at Tennis Australia, I was involved in setting up an independent expert medical review panel for the purpose of reviewing applications from players and players' support staff for medical exemptions to vaccination to attend or participate in the Australian Open tennis tournament. 4. While considering what process to adopt, the review process was discussed with the Victorian Government's Department of Health ( DoH). In addition to Tennis Australia's requirements, I understand that a person who is unvaccinated requires a medical exemption in order to enter into the State of Victoria. 5. The DoH and Tennis Australia put in place a two-step process for considering medical exemptions for unvaccinated entrants. First, the application for a medical exemption would be determined by a panel of suitably-qualified independent experts, appointed by Tennis Australia, who would either approve, reject or ask for further information for each application.

If the application was approved by TA's Panel, the application would be provided to the DoH's independent panel ( DoH Panel ) which would then make its own determination. 8. I initially received a number of applications for a medical exemption to vaccination. I passed each application to one of our employees , who removed identifying information from each application to ensure that each application did not contain information which could identify the applicant. 9. TA's Panel and the DoH Panel are each tasked with determining whether each application for medical exemption met the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) guidelines on medical exemptions to vaccination. 10. On 28 December 2021, TA's Panel approved the plaintiff's medical exemption to vaccination. 11. The plaintiff's application, the subject of the TA's Panel approved exemption, was then provided to the DoH Panel. 12. The DoH Panel reviewed and endorsed the plaintiff's application for medical exemption to vaccination. 13.

This advice covers those for whom an exemption can be provided and does not cover clinical management of adverse events. For the management of adverse events refer to your local Specialist Immunisation Service. Background COVID -19 vaccines have been demonstrated to be safe and effective and as such are recommended for all Australians from 12 years of age. There are very few situations where a vaccine is contraindicated and as such, medical exemption is expected to be rarely requ ired. Temporary exemptions An exemption should not be given when an alternative COVID -19 vaccine is available and when completing the medical exemption ( IM011) form all COVID -19 brands must be selected. Valid reasons for a temporary exemption include: For an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine , inflammatory cardiac illness within the past 3 months, e.g., myocarditis or pericarditis; acute rheumatic fever or acute rheumatic heart disease (i.e., with active myocardial inflammation); or acute decompensated heart failure For all COVID -19 vaccines: o Acute major medical condition (e.g. undergoing major surgery or hospital admission for a serious illness). Typically, these are time -limited conditions (or the medical treatment for them is time limited). o PCR-confirmed SARS -CoV-2 infection , where vaccination can be deferred until 6 months after the infection . Vaccinati on should be deferred for 90 days in people who have received anti-SARS -CoV-2 monoclonal antibody or convalescent plasma therapy. o Any serious adverse event attributed to a previous dose of a COVID -19 vaccine , without another cause identified , and with no a cceptable alternative vaccine available. For example a person <60 years of age, contraindicated to receive Pfizer vaccine and in whom the risks do not outweigh the benefits for receipt of AstraZeneca vaccine, is eligible for a temporary exemption. o If the v accinee is a risk to themselves or others during the vaccination pro cess they may warrant a temporary vaccine exemption. This may include a range of individuals with underlying developmental or mental health disorders , but noting that non -pharmacological interventions can safely facilitate vaccination in many individuals with behavioural ATTACHMENT R DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABCATAGI Guidance 2 disturbances and that s pecialist services may be available to facilitate the safe administration of vaccines in this population. Chronic symptoms following COVID -19 (\"Long COVID\") are not a contraindication to COVID -19 vaccines, but do warrant a clinical discussion with the patient. Pregnancy is not a valid reason for exemption in the absence of any of the criteria listed above . Assessment of serious adverse events followin g immunisation (AEFI) An adverse event is considered serious if it: requires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation OR results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity OR is potentially life -threatening . AND has been reported to a state/territory adverse event surveillance system and/or t he TGA . AND has been determined following review by, and/or on the opinion of, an experienced immunisation provider/medical specialist to be associated with a risk of recurrence of the serious adverse event if another dose is given . Assessment of an advers e event following immunisation (AEFI) requires detailed information on the event, a determination of the likelihood of a causal link with vaccination, as well as the severity of the condition. Examples of serious AEFI include: thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS) following Vaxzevria (ITP), myocarditis), potentially life -threatening events (e.g., anaphylaxis); and/or persistent or significant disability (e.g., Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome). These reactions do not include common expected local or systemic reactions known to occur within the first few days after vaccination. Attributing a serious adv erse event to a previous dose of a COVID -19 vaccine may require discussion with the individual's GP, local immunisation service or relevant medical specialist. Duration of temporary exemption Temporary exemptions for longer than 6 months are NOT recommended in the first instance, as they should be reviewed as the individual recovers from their acute major medical illness. This time limitation will allow individuals who can safely be vaccinated to be protected against COVID -19 in a timely way. It may take a few weeks for any changes to an individual's vaccine status to be updated on the AIR with regards to a temporary medical exemption . It should also be noted that an individual may not be optimally protected from COVID -19 until they have completed the recommended vaccine schedule and this temporary exemption may need to be reconsidered depending on the SARS CoV -2 epidemiology at the time. Temporary medical exemptions can only be completed by those authorised to do so [AIR medical exemption criteria], utilising their Medicare provider number .

Dear David We refer to our correspondence yesterday and now provide some further relevant information for the Minister's attention, namely the enclosed letter from Assoc Professor Verica Jovanovic. We ask that you confirm that the Minister will consider this information before making any decision. Should the Minister for Immigration purport to cancel Mr Djokovic's visa under section 133C(3), we hold instructions to immediately apply to the Courts for relief. Further, we have instructions to seek an urgent (almost immediate) final trial. Judge Kelly is already well-familiar with issues in the case, including the proper interpretation of the ATAGI guidelines. In the meantime, we request that you take all appropriate steps to ensure that the Minister is available for cross-examination at short notice in the event that the Minister purports to cancel Mr Djokovic's visa. We anticipate that, if such a decision be made, then proceedings will be commenced forthwith, and that we will ask the Court to conduct an urgent final hearing, and to issue a subpoena to the Minister to attend to give evidence at that hearing.

Risk to public health and safety - section 116(1)(e) 1 Mr Djokovic has recently tested negative for COVID-19 infection. He poses a negligible threat of infection to others. Further, the risk of Mr Djokovic infecting others is less than, or at the very least comparable to, that of any other person who is lawfully entitled to enter Australia in accordance with section 3(a) of the Biosecurity (Entry Requirements\u2014Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Determination 2021 ( Determination ). 2 There is a body of medical evidence demonstrating that persons who have been recently infected with COVID-19 have immunity to re-infection that is higher than that, or at least equal to that, of those who have been double vaccinated. In other words, they are at less risk of infection.1 The studies indicate that the level of protection from reinfection acquired from prior COVID-19 infection is as high as 95%.2 The improved immunity from COVID-19 is present in recently infected persons regardless of disease severity during recent infection.3 1 Dan, Jennifer M., et al. \"Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to eight months after infection.\" BioRxiv (2020).

Evidence of medical contraindication - Determination 3(b) 5 There is evidence that vaccination following recent infection may result in more severe adverse side effects. 6 Dr John O'Horo, M.D., a leading infectious diseases physician at Mayo Clinic, is quoted as saying: \" ...those vaccinated shortly after recovery may mount a more robust immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine. This could cause stronger side effects \".5 7 There is evidence that adults vaccinated after recent COVID-19 infection have suffered adult multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-A).6 8 Mr Djokovic has produced evidence of recent COVID-19 infection and recovery. 9 Mr Djokovic is accordingly a person who is at risk of suffering more severe adverse side effects from vaccination, because he has been recently infected with COVID-19. Definition of 'medical contraindication' within the meaning of the Determination 10 Finally, an observation is made in respect of the potential broader policy implications if a dispute in respect of the proposed visa cancellation is to be further adjudicated on the merits. 11 The Determination requires to provide evidence of medical contraindication. The Determination does not require evidence of absolute medical contraindication (such as risk of death). The Minister would be in error to require Mr Djokovic to produce evidence of absolute medical contraindication. 12 It would be open, and indeed correct, for Mr Djokovic to contend that the proper interpretation of the Determination is to provide evidence of any medical contraindication that is applicable to the visa holder. 13 For the reasons set out above, there is a body of medical evidence of medical contraindication against vaccination for those who have been recently infected with COVID-19. 14 Additionally, however, there is ample evidence that there are risks of adverse side effects arising from vaccination against COVID-19 generally , and an abundance of cases where adverse side effects have been reported. Those general risks must fall within the definition of a 'medical contraindication' to vaccination. Those risks apply to Mr Djokovic. 15 Were a Court to apply the above interpretation of the Determination (as would be contended by Mr Djokovic), there could be much broader and unintended national policy consequences to the classes of persons falling within cl 3(b) of the Determination. Such consequences are not intended by Mr Djokovic - he merely wishes to play in a professional sporting event as a professional sportsperson, and has no interest in shaping Australia's Rank, Andreas, et al. \"One year after mild COVID-19: the majority of patients maintain specific immunity, but one in four still suffer from long-term symptoms.\" Journal of clinical medicine 10.15 (2021): 3305. 4 Appelman, Brent, et al. \"Time previously infected individuals.\" medRxiv (2021). 5 https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/recent-infection-could-affect-covid-19-vaccination 6 Salzman, M.

In those circumstances, the preferable outcome for all parties involved would be to allow Mr Djokovic to enter Australia on his visa and play in the Australian Open.

Care of Tennis Australia of Olympic Boulevard MELBOURNE State VIC Postcode 3000 Part D Evidence 1. I am a medical practitioner with a Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery from the University of NSW, a Fellowship of the Australasian College of Sport and Exercise Medicine Physicians and a PhD from the University of Sydney. I have worked as a medical practitioner for approximately 32 years. 2. I am the Chief Medical Officer of Tennis Australia and I am authorised to swear this affidavit. 3. As part of my role at Tennis Australia, I was involved in setting up an independent expert medical review panel for the purpose of reviewing applications from players and players' support staff for medical exemptions to vaccination to attend or participate in the Australian Open tennis tournament. 4. While considering what process to adopt, the review process was discussed with the Victorian Government's Department of Health ( DoH). In addition to Tennis Australia's requirements, I understand that a person who is unvaccinated requires a medical exemption in order to enter into the State of Victoria. 5. The DoH and Tennis Australia put in place a two-step process for considering medical exemptions for unvaccinated entrants. First, the application for a medical exemption would be determined by a panel of suitably-qualified independent experts, appointed by Tennis Australia, who would either approve, reject or ask for further information for each application.

Tennis Australia appointed (MBBS, B. Med.Sci., FRACP, FTTM (RCPS Glasgow) FISTM, PhD), Professor Infectious Diseases and Virology and (MBBS, MA (Bioinf), FRACP, PhD), Infectious Disease Physician as its expert panel ( TA's Panel ). 7. If the application was approved by TA's Panel, the application would be provided to the DoH's independent panel ( DoH Panel ) which would then make its own determination. 8. I initially received a number of applications for a medical exemption to vaccination. I passed each application to one of our employees , who removed identifying information from each application to ensure that each application did not contain information which could identify the applicant. 9. TA's Panel and the DoH Panel are each tasked with determining whether each application for medical exemption met the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) guidelines on medical exemptions to vaccination. 10. On 28 December 2021, TA's Panel approved the plaintiff's medical exemption to vaccination. 11. The plaintiff's application, the subject of the TA's Panel approved exemption, was then provided to the DoH Panel. 12. The DoH Panel reviewed and endorsed the plaintiff's application for medical exemption to vaccination. 13. On 30 December 2021, I signed a letter confirming that the 2 panels had approved the plaintiff's application for medical exemption to vaccination. Annexed to this affidavit and marked 'CRB-1' is a true copy of this advice regarding medical exemption to vaccination granted to the plaintiff.

This advice covers those for whom an exemption can be provided and does not cover clinical management of adverse events. For the management of adverse events refer to your local Specialist Immunisation Service. Background COVID -19 vaccines have been demonstrated to be safe and effective and as such are recommended for all Australians from 12 years of age. There are very few situations where a vaccine is contraindicated and as such, medical exemption is expected to be rarely requ ired. Temporary exemptions An exemption should not be given when an alternative COVID -19 vaccine is available and when completing the medical exemption ( IM011) form all COVID -19 brands must be selected. Valid reasons for a temporary exemption include: For an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine , inflammatory cardiac illness within the past 3 months, e.g., myocarditis or pericarditis; acute rheumatic fever or acute rheumatic heart disease (i.e., with active myocardial inflammation); or acute decompensated heart failure For all COVID -19 vaccines: o Acute major medical condition (e.g. undergoing major surgery or hospital admission for a serious illness). Typically, these are time -limited conditions (or the medical treatment for them is time limited). o PCR-confirmed SARS -CoV-2 infection , where vaccination can be deferred until 6 months after the infection . Vaccinati on should be deferred for 90 days in people who have received anti-SARS -CoV-2 monoclonal antibody or convalescent plasma therapy. o Any serious adverse event attributed to a previous dose of a COVID -19 vaccine , without another cause identified , and with no a cceptable alternative vaccine available. For example a person <60 years of age, contraindicated to receive Pfizer vaccine and in whom the risks do not outweigh the benefits for receipt of AstraZeneca vaccine, is eligible for a temporary exemption. o If the v accinee is a risk to themselves or others during the vaccination pro cess they may warrant a temporary vaccine exemption. This may include a range of individuals with underlying developmental or mental health disorders , but noting that non -pharmacological interventions can safely facilitate vaccination in many individuals with behavioural ATTACHMENT R DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABCATAGI Guidance 2 disturbances and that s pecialist services may be available to facilitate the safe administration of vaccines in this population. Chronic symptoms following COVID -19 (\"Long COVID\") are not a contraindication to COVID -19 vaccines, but do warrant a clinical discussion with the patient. Pregnancy is not a valid reason for exemption in the absence of any of the criteria listed above . Assessment of serious adverse events followin g immunisation (AEFI) An adverse event is considered serious if it: requires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation OR results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity OR is potentially life -threatening . AND has been reported to a state/territory adverse event surveillance system and/or t he TGA . AND has been determined following review by, and/or on the opinion of, an experienced immunisation provider/medical specialist to be associated with a risk of recurrence of the serious adverse event if another dose is given . Assessment of an advers e event following immunisation (AEFI) requires detailed information on the event, a determination of the likelihood of a causal link with vaccination, as well as the severity of the condition. Examples of serious AEFI include: thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS) following Vaxzevria (ITP), myocarditis), potentially life -threatening events (e.g., anaphylaxis); and/or persistent or significant disability (e.g., Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome). These reactions do not include common expected local or systemic reactions known to occur within the first few days after vaccination. Attributing a serious adv erse event to a previous dose of a COVID -19 vaccine may require discussion with the individual's GP, local immunisation service or relevant medical specialist. Duration of temporary exemption Temporary exemptions for longer than 6 months are NOT recommended in the first instance, as they should be reviewed as the individual recovers from their acute major medical illness. This time limitation will allow individuals who can safely be vaccinated to be protected against COVID -19 in a timely way. It may take a few weeks for any changes to an individual's vaccine status to be updated on the AIR with regards to a temporary medical exemption . It should also be noted that an individual may not be optimally protected from COVID -19 until they have completed the recommended vaccine schedule and this temporary exemption may need to be reconsidered depending on the SARS CoV -2 epidemiology at the time. Temporary medical exemptions can only be completed by those authorised to do so [AIR medical exemption criteria], utilising their Medicare provider number .

We report 6 cas- es of MIS from a large integrated health system in Southern California, USA; 3 of those patients received SARS-CoV-2 vaccination shortly before seeking care for MIS. All 6 patients met the Brighton Collabora- tion Level 1 of diagnostic certainty for a defi nitive case and had MIS illness onset between January 15- February 15, 2021. The Chief Compliance Offi cer for the Southern California Permanente Medical Group reviewed this case series and confi rmed that it was compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act for publication. The Study Patient 1 was a 20-year-old Hispanic woman who sought care for 3 days of a diffuse body rash, tac-tile fever, sore throat, mild neck discomfort, and fatigue. There was no cough, congestion, headache, or abdominal pain. She had vomiting and diarrhea, which had subsided 8 days before admission. She received her fi rst dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 15 days before admission. She had no known corona- virus disease (COVID-19) exposure but was SARS- CoV-2 PCR and nucleocapsid IgG positive. She was hypotensive at arrival to the emergency depart- ment, requiring inotropic support. She had elevated troponin and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) with a left ventricular ejection fraction initially mildly reduced at 45% but 30%-35% the following day. She responded well to therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and methylprednisolone (Table 1). Patient 2 was a 40-year-old Hispanic man who sought care after 6 days of episodic fevers up to 101.7\u00b0F. Associated symptoms included dyspnea on exertion, headache, neck pain, lethargy, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. No chest pain was present. He had a history of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and labo- ratory-confi rmed mild to moderate COVID-19, both within 48 days before seeking care (Figure). His exam was notable for sweats, diffuse abdominal pain on palpation, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Patient 2 ful- fi lled infl ammatory and cardiac markers, and electrocardiogram changes that were concerning for myocarditis ( 3). He responded well to treatment with dexamethasone (Table 1). Patient 3 was an 18-year-old Asian American man who sought care at the emergency department with a history of 3 days of fever as high as 104\u00b0F with headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping (Figure). He denied any upper respira- tory symptoms.

These 6 patients were hospitalized at 5 of the 15 Kaiser Permanente medical centers across Southern California. We be - lieve the temporal association after SARS-CoV-2 immunization is worth noting, given the theoreti - cal concern of MIS-C/A after vaccination ( 3). We did not identify any patients with MIS after vac - cination who did not have recent SARS-CoV-2 in - fection. It is possible that other case-patients in our member population were hospitalized outside of our 15 medical centers and thus were not captured for this case series. Overall, MIS is rare in adults. In comparison we treated >50 children with MIS-C during January 2021-February 2021 and >100 since May 2020 among a pediatric population of 960,000. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) allows for vaccination after a SARS-CoV-2 infection after recovery from the acute illness and after the isolation period, with no recommended minimal interval between infection and vaccination (4). Most cases of MIS-C/A occur 2-6 weeks after an exposure or infection ( 1-3), although we have seen several children brought for care as late as 8-10 weeks after a confirmed infection or exposure. We need to continue to monitor for MIS-C/A after SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunization as more of the population are vaccinated, especially as vac - cines are administered to children who are at high - er risk for MIS. CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration co-manage VAERS (the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System), which is being used to monitor for adverse events after COVID-19 vaccines. MIS-C/A is listed as a postvaccination adverse event of special interest ( 5) and should be reported to VAERS ( 6).About the Author Dr. Salzman is a pediatric infectious diseases physician and assistant chief of the Department of Pediatrics at Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.

We studied whether post-vaccination immune response is equally potent in individuals infected over six months prior to vaccination. Methods: We tested serum IgG binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and neutralising capacity in 110 health- care workers, before and after both BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccinations. We compared outcomes between participants with more recent infection ( n= 18, median two months, IQR 2-3), with infection-vacci- nation interval over six months ( n= 19, median nine months, IQR 9-10), and to those not previously infected (n= 73). Findings: Both recently and earlier infected participants showed comparable humoral immune responses after a single mRNA vaccination, while exceeding those of previously uninfected persons after two vaccina- tions with 2.5 fold ( p= 0.003) and 3.4 fold ( p<0.001) for binding antibody levels, and 6.4 and 7.2 fold for neutralisation titres, respectively (both p<0.001). The second vaccine dose yielded no further substantial improvement of the humoral response in the previously infected participants (0.97 fold, p= 0.92), while it was associated with a 4 fold increase in antibody binding levels and 18 fold increase in neutralisation titres in previously uninfected participants (both p<0.001). Adjustment for potential confounding of sex and age did not affect these ndings. Interpretation: Delaying the second vaccination in individuals infected up to ten months prior may constitute a more ef cient use of limited vaccine supplies.

The rate-limiting factor for many vaccine strategies is the limited availability of vaccines. Studies on antibody response following vaccination are emerging, and dem- onstrate that for those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection one dose of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine induces antibody levels similar to, or even exceeding the antibody response for those without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection after two doses [2/C08]. Data on antibody response in patients with a long interval between infection and vacci- nation (i.e. more than six months) are still sparse. We compared the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein speci c IgG antibody levels and neutralis- ing antibody titres of sera before and after the rst and second dose of BNT162b2 (P zer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccine between (1) partici- pants infected within six months prior to vaccination, (2) previously infected participants infected earlier (over six months prior to vacci- nation) and (3) previously uninfected participants. 2. Methods 2.1. Study design In March 2020 we initiated a prospective serologic surveillance cohort study among hospital healthcare workers in two tertiary med- ical centers in the Netherlands (S3 cohort; NL 73478.029.20, Nether- lands Trial Register NL8645). In short, follow-up visits were scheduled regularly (March, April, May, June, October 2020, January 2021) and included serological testing, surveys regarding results ofnucleic acid ampli cation testing (NAAT), and presence of COVID-19 related symptoms since the previous visit. For comprehensive details about inclusion and follow-up of this cohort we refer to the original article of the S3 study [9]. Between January 6th and 13th 2021, a selection of cohort partici- pants received their rst dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. This selec- tion was based on potential, work-related, high exposure to SARS- CoV-2 as part of the national vaccination strategy in the Netherlands. A second dose was administered 21 days after the rst; sera were obtained within 24 h of the rst vaccination, 21 days after the rst vaccination, and 28 days after the second dose. Participants were divided in three groups with regard to previous infection status: (1) participants infected within six months prior to vaccination, named recently infected, (2) participants infected earlier (over six months prior to vaccination), named earlier infected, and (3) previously uninfected participants. The infection date was determined by the date of a positive SARS- CoV-2 NAAT result. For subjects without an available positive NAAT result, the timing of infection was based on the history of clinical symptoms in combination with seroconversion measured at previous timepoints of the study. For participants with asymptomatic serocon- version, we used the midpoint between the last seronegative sample and the rst seropositive sample. Participants without a positive NAAT result or seroconversion during follow-up since onset of the cohort in March 2020, were considered uninfected. 2.2. Ethics The study was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of both hospitals and accepted by the competent authority, the Central Committee on Research on Human Subjects (NL73478.029.20). Writ- ten informed consent was obtained from each participant. 2.3. Serological response In the months prior to vaccination, seroconversion was de ned as a serological response tion, used a custom Luminex assay. To identify recent SARS-CoV- 2 infections, serum obtained within 24 h of rst vaccination was tested for a serological response by using the Luminex assay. In case of intermediate IgG SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding in previously uninfected participants, a Wantai ELISA was performed to con rm this recent infection. The custom Luminex assay was described previously [11].I n short, prefusion coupled to Luminex Magplex beads with a ratio of 75 mg protein to 12.5 million beads. The protein design of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is described previously [11]. Optimisation studies showed an optimal dilution of sera of 1:100,000 for measuring the infection and vaccination response. After an overnight incubation, plates were washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) AB_2795648, vali- dated by Southern Biotech). on a Magpix (Luminex). Resulting mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values are the median of approximately 50 beads per well and were corrected by subtraction of MFI values from buffer and beads only wells. To investigate the neutralising capacity of sera of those previously infected and a random sample of 50 previously uninfected, we used the previously described pseudovirus neutralisation assay [11].I n short, incubated for 1h at 37 \u00b0C before adding this mixture to HEK293T cells expressing angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor of SARS-CoV-2. After 48 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured by usingResearch in context Evidence before this study Recent studies show that a single mRNA vaccination in individ- uals with recent COVID-19 (up to six months prior) provides a potent immune response, equivalent to, or exceeding, the anti- body response after two vaccinations in individuals without previous SARS-CoV-2- infection. Little is known about immune responses after a single vaccine dose in individuals that suf- fered from COVID-19 over six months prior to vaccination. Added value of this study We show that one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine induces a humoral immune response in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 that exceeds antibody responses in unin- fected individuals after two vaccine doses, even if the infection occurred more than six months prior. The humoral immune response after each dose in individuals infected over six months prior was shown to be at least similar to those recently infected; the second vaccination elicited no substantial improvement of humoral response for previously infected in either group. Our study is the rst to compare data of individu- als with recent infection (within six months) to those infected over six months ago - and suggests a single mRNA vaccine in individuals infected up to ten months prior to vaccination is sufcient to elicit a potent humoral immune response. Implications of all the available evidence To maximise the number of individuals protected against SARS- CoV-2 by vaccination, delayed administration of the second dose for individuals with previous infection up to six months is accepted policy in parts of the world. Available evidence sug- gests this strategy could include individuals that suffered COVID-19 up to ten months prior to vaccination, and possibly longer. This could enable earlier vaccination of uninfected individuals.2 B. Appelman et al. / EBioMedicine (Promega). Relative luminescence units were normalized to the units from cells infected with pseudovi- rus in absence of serum. Neutralisation levels were the serum dilu- tion at which infectivity was inhibited 50% (ID 50) using a non-lineair regression curve t (GraphPad Prism software version 8.3). Neutrali- sation ID 50values <100 were considered negative. 2.4. Statistical analysis Binding antibody levels and neutralisation titres were reported as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR). Antibody levels were com- pared between groups by using a Mann-Whitney-U test (MW). For categorical outcomes a chi-square test was used ( x2). In order to adjust for participants 'sex and age as potential confounders, we log transformed all outcomes and then performed univariable and multi- variable linear regression analysis. Results were considered statisti- cally signi cant at p<0.05. We used R Core Team (2020). R: A language and environment for statistical computing.

Results We included 110 participants who received their rst vaccination with BNT162b2 (P zer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccine in January 2021, of whom 73 individuals were previously uninfected and 37 had a docu- mented infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the past year. 8 out of 37 partici- pants remained asymptomatic during infection. Median age of participants was 42 years (IQR 32 /C054) and 69% were female ( Table 1 ). The median interval between SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in the recently infected group was two months (IQR 2-3, n= 18), and in the earlier infected group nine months (IQR 9-10, n= 19) ( Table 1 ). Binding antibody ndings of three participants were excluded from analysis due to technical issues. Neutralising antibody levels of one par- ticipant after the rst vaccination were excluded because of a suspected sample switch as this sample showed a discrepant high neutralisation capacity compared to normal binding levels at the same time point and lower neutralisation titres following second vaccination. 3.1. Humoral immune response in participants with and without previous infection Most participants with prior documented SARS-CoV-2 infection still had detectable anti-spike protein antibodies pre-vaccination(median 162 MFI, IQR 70-341, Fig. 1 a). After one vaccine dose, bind- ing antibody levels increased 36 and 664 fold for the previously infected and uninfected individuals, respectively. Binding antibody levels in previously infected individuals after one dose signi cantly exceeded those observed in the fully vaccinated individuals without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (median previous infection of SARS-CoV-2 had higher neutralising antibody titres after one vaccine dose, compared to fully vaccinated uninfected individuals (median 12,615 ID 50, IQR 8003/C019,111, (MW)) ( Fig. 1 few uninfected individuals showed substan- tial neutralising titres following a single vaccination (median 102 ID50, IQR 100 /C0315). None of the participants had signs of an SARS- CoV-2 infection after the rst vaccination. After the second vaccine dose, binding antibody levels and neu- tralisation titres increased 4.1 and 18.2 fold for the previously unin- fected individuals, respectively; whereas antibody binding levels and neutralisation titres in previously infected individuals did not change substantially: 0.92 and 1.17 fold change, respectively. 3.2. Adjustment for confounding Univariable regression analysis mirrored above outcomes: bind- ing antibody levels values were signi cantly higher in both the recently infected group (log MFI: 8.33) and earlier infected group (log MFI: 8.72) 21 days after the rst vaccination, as compared to the uninfected group 28 days after the second vaccination (log MFI: 7.59, difference 0.74, titres were signi cantly higher in both the recently infected group (log ID 50:8.96) and earlier infected group (log ID 50:9.41) 21 days after the rst vaccination, as compared to the uninfected group 28 days after the second vaccination (log ID 50:7.57, sex and age to the model as potential confound- ers, did not importantly alter these results ( Table 2 ). 3.3. Time since infection and humoral immune response Pre-vaccination antibody binding levels were similar between recently and earlier infected participants (median 215 MFI, IQR (MW)). After the rst vaccination dose, no difference was observed between these groups for both binding antibody levels 0.26 (MW)). After the second vaccination, antibody binding levels were similar between recently and earlier infected participants (median 4989 MFI, IQR 1770 /C06479, and median 7131 (%) 12 (67) 18 (95) 46 (63) 76 (69) Previous infection documented by: Both NAAT & serology positive (%) 15 (83) 12 (63) 27 (25) Only seroconversion (%) 3 (17) 7 (37) 10 (9) Time between vaccine and infection, Months (median (IQR))2.0 (2.0-3.0) Binding antibody levels and neutralising titres are plotted against time since infection in Supplementary Fig. S1a + b. 3.4. Side effects Overall, 100 (91%) participants reported any side effect after the rst dose, and 84 (76%) after the second dose. After the rst vaccina- tion dose, previously infected individuals experienced more local skin reactions (19.4 vs 2.9%, p= 0.01 p<0.001 ( x2)) compared to uninfected individuals. Also, more individuals without prior infection reported no com- plaints at all (0 vs 14.3%, p= 0.04 ( x2)). We found no signi cant dif- ference in the incidence of side effects after the second dose (Supplementary Table S1). 4. Discussion In this study, we demonstrate that one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine boosts the humoral immune response in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 to a level that exceeds antibody responses in uninfected individuals after two vaccine doses, even if the infection occurred over six months prior.The humoral immune response after each dose in individuals infected over six months ago was at least similar to those recently infected. In addition, no substantial rise in serum binding antibody levels or neutralising capacity was observed following second vacci- nation in either group of previously infected individuals. Our study is therst to compare SARS-CoV-2 antibody binding and neutralisation responses in individuals with recent infection (within six months) to those infected more than six months prior to vaccination. Also it is therst to include all relevant time points (before vaccination, 21 days after rst vaccination, 28 days after second vaccination), in a well documented cohort followed since the onset of the pandemic. Our ndings are in line with previous studies showing that recently infected participants (mean time since infection: 111 days) had higher neutralisation titres after one vaccine dose in comparison to previously uninfected participants after the second dose, with a trend towards increasing neutralisation titres over time since infec- tion [7]. Another study comprising only individuals with earlier infec- tion (median time since infection: eight-nine months) showed both higher binding and neutralising antibody responses after a single dose of mRNA vaccine compared to individuals not previously infected [6]. These studies together with the current study strongly suggest that a single vaccine dose in previously infected individuals with an infection-vaccine interval longer than six months induces an immune response at least similar to recently infected individuals. This conclusion is in line with the hypothesis that infection is Fig. 1. Antibody levels and neutralisation in convalescent COVID-19 patients and uninfected participants prior to and after rst and second vaccine dose. The overarching line repre- sents the comparison of both the previous infected groups after the rst vaccination with the non-infected group after the second vaccination.

The number of participants with a recent infection, earlier infection and no previous infection pre-vaccination were: n= 19, n= 20 and n= 84, respectively, at 21 days after the rst vaccination: n= 17, n= 17, n= 82, respectively, and at 28 days after the second vaccination: n= 18, n= 19 and n=n= 73, respectively. Group medians were compared using the Mann-Whitney-U test. There was no signi cant difference at 21 days after the rst vaccination and at 28 days after the second vaccination between the recent infection and the earlier infection groups, p=0/C1511 and p=0/C1513, respectively. The results of the recently infected and earlier infected groups at 21 days after the rst vaccination were signi - cantly different from the non-infected group at 28 days after the second vaccination, p=0/C15003 and p<0/C15001 respectively.

This response in previously exposed individuals is most likely explained by a recall of SARS-CoV-2 speci c memory B cells elicited during their rst exposure to the virus [12]. Our results demonstrate this effect is durable over time up to at least ten months after infec- tion. Furthermore, we found no substantial change in immune response following the second vaccination for previously infected participants. Prior research found serum neutralising potency against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus actually decreased following the second dose in previously infected individuals, reducing the likelihood of additional bene t of the second dose in these individuals.2 Considering limited vaccine supply in the midst of this global pan- demic, several countries (including the Netherlands) currently rec- ommend administering a single dose to individuals infected in the previous six months, whilst the regular scheme of two doses is advised when infection was over six months ago [13].12Our results suggest this may be extended to at least ten months past infection,which could make vaccines for previously uninfected individuals more readily available. Our study has some important potential limitations. First and foremost the sample size of previously infected participants is rela- tively low. Second, our healthcare worker cohort consists of relatively healthy, young individuals with a mild or asymptomatic history of SARS-CoV-2 infection; results may not be generalisable to e.g. immu- nocompromised individuals or those with severe previous COVID-19 disease. Lastly, we did not evaluate cellular immune responses which are likely to contribute to vaccine ef cacy as well [14]. However, neu- tralising antibody levels are shown to be predictive of immunity to COVID-19 [15]. In conclusion, one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine induces humoral immune responses in individuals previously infected with SARS-Cov-2 exceeding those of uninfected individuals after two doses, whether infected occurred recently or over six months prior to vaccination. Delayed administration of the second vaccination dose for individuals with previous infection up to ten months, and likely longer, may constitute a more ef cient vaccination strategy.Fig. 1.

Risk to public health and safety - section 116(1)(e) 1 Mr Djokovic has recently tested negative for COVID-19 infection. He poses a negligible threat of infection to others. Further, the risk of Mr Djokovic infecting others is less than, or at the very least comparable to, that of any other person who is lawfully entitled to enter Australia in accordance with section 3(a) of the Biosecurity (Entry Requirements\u2014Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Determination 2021 ( Determination ). 2 There is a body of medical evidence demonstrating that persons who have been recently infected with COVID-19 have immunity to re-infection that is higher than that, or at least equal to that, of those who have been double vaccinated. In other words, they are at less risk of infection.1 The studies indicate that the level of protection from reinfection acquired from prior COVID-19 infection is as high as 95%.2 The improved immunity from COVID-19 is present in recently infected persons regardless of disease severity during recent infection.3 1 Dan, Jennifer M., et al. \"Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to eight months after infection.\" BioRxiv (2020).

Evidence of medical contraindication - Determination 3(b) 5 There is evidence that vaccination following recent infection may result in more severe adverse side effects. 6 Dr John O'Horo, M.D., a leading infectious diseases physician at Mayo Clinic, is quoted as saying: \" ...those vaccinated shortly after recovery may mount a more robust immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine. This could cause stronger side effects \".5 7 There is evidence that adults vaccinated after recent COVID-19 infection have suffered adult multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-A).6 8 Mr Djokovic has produced evidence of recent COVID-19 infection and recovery. 9 Mr Djokovic is accordingly a person who is at risk of suffering more severe adverse side effects from vaccination, because he has been recently infected with COVID-19. Definition of 'medical contraindication' within the meaning of the Determination 10 Finally, an observation is made in respect of the potential broader policy implications if a dispute in respect of the proposed visa cancellation is to be further adjudicated on the merits. 11 The Determination requires to provide evidence of medical contraindication. The Determination does not require evidence of absolute medical contraindication (such as risk of death). The Minister would be in error to require Mr Djokovic to produce evidence of absolute medical contraindication. 12 It would be open, and indeed correct, for Mr Djokovic to contend that the proper interpretation of the Determination is to provide evidence of any medical contraindication that is applicable to the visa holder. 13 For the reasons set out above, there is a body of medical evidence of medical contraindication against vaccination for those who have been recently infected with COVID-19. 14 Additionally, however, there is ample evidence that there are risks of adverse side effects arising from vaccination against COVID-19 generally , and an abundance of cases where adverse side effects have been reported. Those general risks must fall within the definition of a 'medical contraindication' to vaccination. Those risks apply to Mr Djokovic. 15 Were a Court to apply the above interpretation of the Determination (as would be contended by Mr Djokovic), there could be much broader and unintended national policy consequences to the classes of persons falling within cl 3(b) of the Determination. Such consequences are not intended by Mr Djokovic - he merely wishes to play in a professional sporting event as a professional sportsperson, and has no interest in shaping Australia's Rank, Andreas, et al. \"One year after mild COVID-19: the majority of patients maintain specific immunity, but one in four still suffer from long-term symptoms.\" Journal of clinical medicine 10.15 (2021): 3305. 4 Appelman, Brent, et al. \"Time previously infected individuals.\" medRxiv (2021). 5 https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/recent-infection-could-affect-covid-19-vaccination 6 Salzman, M.

Risk to public health and safety - section 116(1)(e) 1 Mr Djokovic has recently tested negative for COVID-19 infection. He poses a negligible threat of infection to others. Further, the risk of Mr Djokovic infecting others is less than, or at the very least comparable to, that of any other person who is lawfully entitled to enter Australia in accordance with section 3(a) of the Biosecurity (Entry Requirements\u2014Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Determination 2021 ( Determination ). 2 There is a body of medical evidence demonstrating that persons who have been recently infected with COVID-19 have immunity to re-infection that is higher than that, or at least equal to that, of those who have been double vaccinated. In other words, they are at less risk of infection.1 The studies indicate that the level of protection from reinfection acquired from prior COVID-19 infection is as high as 95%.2 The improved immunity from COVID-19 is present in recently infected persons regardless of disease severity during recent infection.3 1 Dan, Jennifer M., et al. \"Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to eight months after infection.\" BioRxiv (2020).

Evidence of medical contraindication - Determination 3(b) 5 There is evidence that vaccination following recent infection may result in more severe adverse side effects. 6 Dr John O'Horo, M.D., a leading infectious diseases physician at Mayo Clinic, is quoted as saying: \" ...those vaccinated shortly after recovery may mount a more robust immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine. This could cause stronger side effects \".5 7 There is evidence that adults vaccinated after recent COVID-19 infection have suffered adult multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-A).6 8 Mr Djokovic has produced evidence of recent COVID-19 infection and recovery. 9 Mr Djokovic is accordingly a person who is at risk of suffering more severe adverse side effects from vaccination, because he has been recently infected with COVID-19. Definition of 'medical contraindication' within the meaning of the Determination 10 Finally, an observation is made in respect of the potential broader policy implications if a dispute in respect of the proposed visa cancellation is to be further adjudicated on the merits. 11 The Determination requires to provide evidence of medical contraindication. The Determination does not require evidence of absolute medical contraindication (such as risk of death). The Minister would be in error to require Mr Djokovic to produce evidence of absolute medical contraindication. 12 It would be open, and indeed correct, for Mr Djokovic to contend that the proper interpretation of the Determination is to provide evidence of any medical contraindication that is applicable to the visa holder. 13 For the reasons set out above, there is a body of medical evidence of medical contraindication against vaccination for those who have been recently infected with COVID-19. 14 Additionally, however, there is ample evidence that there are risks of adverse side effects arising from vaccination against COVID-19 generally , and an abundance of cases where adverse side effects have been reported. Those general risks must fall within the definition of a 'medical contraindication' to vaccination. Those risks apply to Mr Djokovic. 15 Were a Court to apply the above interpretation of the Determination (as would be contended by Mr Djokovic), there could be much broader and unintended national policy consequences to the classes of persons falling within cl 3(b) of the Determination. Such consequences are not intended by Mr Djokovic - he merely wishes to play in a professional sporting event as a professional sportsperson, and has no interest in shaping Australia's Rank, Andreas, et al. \"One year after mild COVID-19: the majority of patients maintain specific immunity, but one in four still suffer from long-term symptoms.\" Journal of clinical medicine 10.15 (2021): 3305. 4 Appelman, Brent, et al. \"Time previously infected individuals.\" medRxiv (2021). 5 https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/recent-infection-could-affect-covid-19-vaccination 6 Salzman, M.

I swear this affidavit in support of an application dated 6 January 2022 made on my behalf by my solicitors, Hall & Wilcox, seeking orders as set out in that application (which I believe may be amended). 3. The following facts and matters set out within this affidavit are within my own personal knowledge except as otherwise stated. Background 4. I am a professional tennis player and a citizen of the Republic of Serbia. 5. I was invited by Tennis Australia (TA) to travel to Australia and play in the 2022 Australian Open tennis tournament. TA is the governing body for tennis in Australia. I have travelled to Australia on at least 9 previous occasions over approximately the last decade to participate in the Australian Open and other tennis tournaments and events in Australia. 6. I have not previously encountered any major immigration or other issues in relation to my entry to Australia. On all previous occasions I have secured the necessary visas from the Commonwealth Government of Australia without difficulty, in consultation with TA, and in what I understand to be the usual manner. 7. I have never been refused an Australian visa in the past and, prior to the event that is the subject of this proceeding, I have not had any previous Australian visa held by me cancelled. \u00a9 ATTACHMENT T DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABCMy preparation for travel to Australia 8. The 2022 Australian Open is scheduled to commence on Monday 17 January 2022 and to finish on Sunday 30 January 2022. The final event of the Australian Open is the Men's Singles Final. I have been fortunate to win the Men's Singles Final at the Australian Open on 9 previous occasions. 9. In or about October or November 2021, I applied for an Australian temporary entry visa, with the assistance of my agent and TA, in order to be able to compete in the 2022 Australian Open. My application was accepted by the Australian Government and a Temporary Activity (subclass 408) visa was granted to me on 18 November 2021. Annexed to this affidavit and marked 'ND-1 ' is a true copy of the Temporary Activity (subclass 408) visa dated 18 November 2021 granted to me. 10. On 16 December 2021, 1 was tested and diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID). Annexed hereto and marked ND-2 ' is a true copy of my COVID-PCR test result issued by the Institute of Public Health of Serbia showing a positive COVID result dated 16 December 2021. 11. On 22 December 2021, I undertook a further COVID-PCR test, which recorded a negative result. Annexed hereto and marked 'ND-3 J is true copy of my COVID-PCR test result issued by the Institute of Public Health of Serbia showing a negative COVID result dated 22 December 2021. 12. As I regularly travel across international borders, I understand that each country has its own entry requirements and, in particular, requirements relating to measures to protect people against the risks of COVID infection. In December 2021, I understood that Australian Government requirements for entry into Australia required me to be vaccinated against COVID or have a medical exemption. I further understood that having a recent COVID infection was a valid ground for obtaining a medical exemption. In consultation with my agent and TA, I sought a medical exemption on the basis that I had been recently infected with, and recovered from, a COVID infection. On 30 December 2021, I was advised by TA that an Independent Expert Medical Review Panel commissioned by TA, reviewed and endorsed by an independent Medical Exemptions Review Panel of the Victorian State Government, had provided me with a temporary medical exemption from COVID vaccination which was valid until 16 May 2022 on the grounds that I had recently recovered from COVID. Annexed to this affidavit and marked 'ND-4 5 is a true copy of the medical exemption granted to me by the Independent Expert Medical Review Panel dated 30 December 2021. 13. The medical exemption document dated 30 December 2021 stated that the exemption was consistent with the recommendations of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI). I have at all times understood that I was entitled to the medical exemption granted to me, based on my recent COVID infection in December 2021, and that this was consistent with all Australian Government entry requirements. My travel to and arrival in Australia 14. On about 1 January 2022, I authorised my agent to submit my Australia Travel Declaration to the Australian Government Department of Home Affairs, based on my understanding that I was entitled to enter Australia on the basis of my temporary visa and the medical exemption granted to me. On 1 January 2022, my agent received an email from the Department of Home Affairs advising that my Australia Travel Declaration had been assessed. Annexed to this affidavit and marked 'ND-5 ' is a true copy of my Australia Travel Declaration Assessment dated 1 January 2022 advising that I met the requirements for quarantine-free arrival upon my arrival in Australia. 15. On about 2 January 2022, I was issued with a Border Travel Permit from the Victorian State Government. Annexed to this affidavit and marked 'ND-6 ' is a true copy of the Border Travel Permit issued to me on 2 January 2022. 16. At this time, having had my visa granted, a medical exemption issued to me, my Australia Travel Declaration assessed and approved by the Australian Government, and the Border Travel Permit issued by the Victorian State Government, I believed that I had satisfied all the necessary requirements for entry into Australia. ATTACHMENT T DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC17. On Tuesday 4 January 2022 I departed from Spain to travel to Melbourne via Dubai. I arrived in Melbourne by commercial airliner at approximately 11:30pm (local time) on Wednesday 5 January 2022. The total trip took about 25 hours, including layovers at various airports. I arrived in Melbourne together with three of my coaches and support staff. Upon landing, we were asked to exit the plane before anyone else and were escorted to passport control. At this point I was asked to produce my passport, which I did. My passport was not returned to me and I have not seen it since then. The passport control officer asked me if I was vaccinated. I said no, but that I have a medical exemption. He asked me for paperwork to support my claim to a medical exemption. I gave him copies of the following documents which I had printed prior to my departure from Spain: a. Visa granted 18 November 2021 (Exhibit ND-1) b. Medical Exemption 30 December 2021 (Exhibit ND-4) c. Travel Declaration dated 1 January 2022 (Exhibit ND-5) d. Border Travel Permit dated 2 January 2022 (Exhibit ND-6) 18. My interaction with the passport control officer lasted only a few minutes. I understood that the passport control officer was not satisfied with my documents, so he called over a male officer from Australian Border Force (ABF) who I subsequently understood to be known as 'Sudhir R' (SR). The passport control officer handed my passport to SR, but I do not recall what happened at that point to my other documents. SR then escorted me to a small room with a table, two chairs and a video camera inside it. He told me that the camera was turned on and that ABF officers would be watching what was going on in the room. SR then left the room for a short time and returned with a small handheld voice recorder and some paperwork. SR told me that everything we speak about would be on the record. The voice recorder was then used throughout the night on occasions when I was being formally interviewed by SR, but not during every conversation I had with him or other ABF officers. 19. At about 12:20am on 6 January 2022, SR commenced a formal interview with me in the small room. He asked me to provide my documentation, and so I gave to him the same documents which I had previously given to the passport control officer. I was asked by SR whether I had previously been infected by COVID. I told him that I had been infected twice with COVID, the most recent occasion being in December 2021. I also gave SR copies of my COVID-PCR test results (Exhibits ND-2 and ND-3), which I had not provided to the passport control officer. I gave these additional documents to him because I understood that the main reason why I was allowed to travel to Australia under a medical exemption was because I had been infected with COVID in the last 6 months. That is why I wanted him to see the COVID-PCR test results, but I recall he did not appear to be very interested in these documents. He then copied those two documents. 20. This interview with SR was interrupted (or suspended) on about 6 to 8 occasions because he told me that he needed to go outside to speak with his supervisors about my documents and the information he was getting from me in the interview. On one such occasion, I started using my phone in the room while SR was away, in order to communicate with my agent, and provide information about what was happening to me. After about 15-20 minutes I was told that I was not able to use my phone and I must switch it off and put it away. I turned off my phone and placed it in my tennis bag next to me as directed. After approximately 90 minutes, there did not appear to be anything else I could provide to him, and so the interview ended and I was allowed to go into the corridor to rest on the sofa. 21. Several hours later, just after 4:00am on 6 January 2022, I was given a document by SR which was a Notice of intention to consider cancellation of my visa. Annexed hereto and marked ND-7 ' is a true copy of the Notice of intention to consider cancellation (forming part of the subsequent record of decision). When he read to me the page headed 'ATTACHMENT A (Part A)', I made some comments. When he said that previous infection with COVID-19 is not considered a medical contraindication for COVID-19 vaccination in Australia, I said that that's not true, and I told him that the Independent State Government medical panel had said and I explained why. I then referred to the two medical panels and the Travel Declaration (which had been assessed by the Commonwealth Government and indicated that I could lawfully enter into Australia). 22. SR signed the notice in front of me at about 4:11am. I did not sign it because I was confused and did not know what to do and I wanted advice from my lawyers. My agent and I had done all that was asked of us in making the application for entry into Australia. I believed that I had complied with all the rules about being permitted to enter into Australia. I did not understand what was happening. And I did not understand why he was considering cancelling my visa. I was upset and confused. It was about 4:00am and I needed some ATTACHMENT T DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABChelp, and I told him that. I wanted to speak to TA, but could not speak to them until 8:00am. He told me he was giving me 20 or so minutes to respond, give comments or give any other information that may affect their decision whether to cancel my visa. At that point I was allowed to use my phone again, being given an opportunity to make a phone call. After making such a call, I asked SR if my lawyers could speak with him (or other ABF officers) directly. SR left the room in order to speak with his superiors. When he came back he said that that would not be possible. SR said that he could only allow my legal representative to be present on the phone and listen to the interview, but the lawyer would not be permitted to speak or participate. I then requested more time to consider what to do because I was tired and I wanted to get some rest and I also wanted to wait for a time closer to local business hours when I could have a better opportunity to contact my lawyers, TA representatives and other relevant people for assistance. At this point it was about 5:00am and SR again left the room to check with his superiors. When he returned, and I believed without turning on the recorder again, he told me that they would grant me more time and they would review everything between 8:00am and 8:30am. After this conversation, I went out to the sofa in the corridor and started to rest. I was mentally and physically tired at this stage and wanted to rest, and I had understood that I had until 8:30am to do so. I was told that a bed was being prepared for me in a separate room to rest, so I waited on the sofa until the bed was made ready. 23. At about 5:00-5:30am, two of SR's superiors approached me on the sofa to speak with me. I was aware that they were his superiors because I had met one of them earlier in the evening and SR described him to me as his superior; the other one I had not previously met. They said to me that it had come to their attention that I was requesting to postpone the decision making on my visa cancellation to 8:30am. They asked why that was the case and whether I wanted to rest. I replied yes, but also that I wanted some help and legal support and advice from my representatives that are currently sleeping and are difficult to get a hold of at this early hour. They told me that my legal representatives wouldn 't be able to make an appeal in the hypothetical case of any visa cancellation before they had made a decision about the cancellation. They said that the sooner that they make a decision, the better for me and my representatives. They said that if they did not cancel my visa, then I would be free to go and I could go to where I was to stay while in Melbourne. They said that if they cancelled my visa, then my lawyers would know what they had to deal with, and could do their legal work to challenge the cancellation. At this point I felt that they were trying to persuade or convince me that it would be better if I responded to the notice earlier rather than later, and that I should do what they were saying. But I said I needed to speak with someone and think about this, because I was confused, I thought I had some time, and I preferred to have more time. I wanted some advice from one of my lawyers, someone from Tennis Australia and/or my agent. The two ABF officers then left me on the sofa. 24. Shortly after this, I was advised that a bed had been prepared for me in a nearby room. I lay down thinking I had time to consider my situation. I was mentally starting to slow down and was on the bed with headphones trying to sleep. I was woken up by SR and one of his superiors. The superior said that I wanted some time to think, which I now had had, and that I now needed to tell them what to do. I didn't know what to do, and said I preferred to have more time and I didn 't know what more they expected me to tell them. They presented to me that it was better for me if the interview was done right away; they said that I can give my comments on the Notice and then they can make a decision, and then my legal team can know what to do, because right now they can't do anything. I felt like I had no choice, but I had to participate in the interview. 25. At this point it was approximately 6:00am and SR and his superior invited me into the interview room. The superior then left, and SR started a formal interview with me. At that point I realised I would not have until 8:30am to prepare and seek advice. I was again asked to explain why I had sought a medical exemption from the COVID vaccination requirements for entry into Australia. I explained that I had been recently infected with COVID in December 2021 and on this basis I was entitled to a medical exemption in accordance with Australian Government rules and guidance. I further explained that my medical exemption had been granted by the Independent Expert Medical Review Panel, that I had previously provided all relevant medical reports to TA, including my COVID-PCR test results, and that accordingly the visa should not be cancelled. I told the ABF officers that I had correctly made my Australian Travel Declaration and otherwise satisfied all necessary requirements in order to lawfully enter Australia on my visa. 26. After the interview ended, SR left the interview room and returned at approximately 7:40am. He then informed me that they had decided to cancel my visa and that I would be removed from Australia as an unlawful non\u00ad citizen. They informed me I was to be taken from the airport to a hotel. This eventually occurred, and I now remain at a hotel under detention. \u00a9 ATTACHMENT T DocuSign Envelope ID: 2375FC54-92AA-424C-8684-E1DFA5574ABC27. During my conversations with SR, he did not say anything about me being a risk to the health or safety of the community, other than simply reading from the documents contained in the Notice of intention to cancel my visa. 28. During my conversations with SR, he did not explain to me that he himself had any discretion about the decision on whether to cancel my visa. On the basis of SR frequently leaving me to check things with his superiors, I believed his superiors were making the decision about the cancellation of my visa. A couple of times I spoke with a female ABF officer and asked her what was going on, why things were taking so long, and when she replied she would say they were on the line and they are just waiting. This all gave me the impression or idea that the decision about my visa was not completely up to the people that were talking to me, and instead it was up to someone else above them.

This visa allows entry into Australia to Participate in Australia Open Tennis Tournament. During an interview with an Australian Border Force (ABF) officer, you have stated you are not vaccinated against COVID-19. You have also provided a copy of a medical exemption issued by Tennis Australia. This medical exemption was issued on the grounds that you have recently recovered from COVID-19. Under the Biosecurity Act 2015, there are requirements for entry into Australian territory. These requirements include that international travellers make a declaration as to their vaccination status (vaccinated, unvaccinated, or medically contraindicated). Travellers may make a declaration that they have a medical contraindication and must provide evidence of that medical contraindication provided by their medical practitioner. Previous infection with COVID-19 is not considered a medical contraindication for COVID-19 vaccination in Australia. A copy of the relevant section of the Biosecurity Act 2015 is attached for your reference. The information you have provided does not show a medical contraindication to COVID-19 vaccines or evidence of that provided by a medical practitioner. Unvaccinated persons create a greater health risk of contracting COVID-19 and spreading COVID-19 to others, either of which will further burden the Australian health system. Ensuring unvaccinated persons do not enter Australia is a key mechanism through which the Australian Government has slowed the spread of COVID-19 within the Australian community. All visa holders, whether permanent or temporary are expected to abide by all public health directives issued by both Commonwealth and state and territory jurisdictions. A breach of these directions is considered a potential risk to the health, safety or good order of the Australian community. Subject to Section 116(1) of the Migration Act 1958, the Minister may cancel a visa if he or she is satisfied that: (e) the presence of its holder in Australia is or may be, or would or might be, a risk to: (i) the health, safety or good order of the Australian community or a segment of the Australian community Based on the above information, I am satisfied there appears to be a ground to consider cancelling your subclass GG-408 visa, due to you presenting a risk to the health, safety or good order of the Australian community or a segment of the Australian community. The ground is that, the Minister may cancel a visa if he or she is satisfied that:... if its holder has not entered Australia or has so entered but has not been immigration cleared - it would be liable to be cancelled under Section 116(l)(e)(i) of the Migration Act 1958.

The Visa holder also provided a copy of a medical exemption issued by Tennis Australia. This medical exemption was issued on the grounds that the visa holder has recently recovered from COVID-19. The visa holder stated he had received an Australian Travel Declaration from the Department of Home Affairs, which was lodged on his behalf by Tennis Australia. Under the Biosecurity Act 2015, there are requirements for entry into Australian territory. These requirements include that international travellers make a declaration as to their vaccination status (vaccinated, unvaccinated, or medically contraindicated). Travellers may make a declaration that they have a medical contraindication and must provide evidence of that medical contraindication provided by their medical practitioner. Previous infection with COVID-19 is not considered a medical contraindication for COVID-19 vaccination in Australia. Unvaccinated persons create a greater health risk of contracting COVID-19 and spreading COVID-19 to others, either of which will further burden the Australian health system. Ensuring unvaccinated persons do not enter Australia is a key mechanism through which the Australian Government has slowed the spread of COVID-19 within the Australian community. All visa holders, whether permanent or temporary are expected to abide by all public health directives issued by both Commonwealth and state and territory jurisdictions. A breach of these directions is considered a potential risk to the health, safety or good order of the Australian community. Subject to Section 116(1) of the Migration Act 1958, the Minister may cancel a visa if he or she is satisfied that: (e) the presence of its holder in Australia is or may be, or would or might be, a risk to: (i) the health, safety or good order of the Australian community or a segment of the Australian community Based on the above information, I am satisfied there are grounds to consider cancelling the visa holder's subclass GG-408 visa. The ground is that, the Minister may cancel a visa if he or she is satisfied that:... if its holder has not entered Australia or has so entered but has not been immigration cleared - it would be liable to be cancelled under Section 116(l)(e)(i) of the Migration Act 1958.
