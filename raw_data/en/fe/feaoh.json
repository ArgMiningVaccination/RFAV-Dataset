(This job pays reasonably well, but it is a very part-time position.) The Crazy Wisdom Weekly, January 7, 20226 From Issue #79 What We Can Predict By Rev. Marie Duquette The Farmer's Almanac predicts a colder, flakier winter than usual for those of us who live in The Mitten. Normally this would not be worth noting, but there is no \"normally\" anymore, and so I do note it. Maybe I note this prediction because at a time when truth seems to be elusive, and not being prepared threatens to be deadly, The Farmer's Almanac is a reliable source when it comes to foretelling the weather and helping people prepare. And it tips its hat to inclusivity, in that anyone is welcome to read and heed its advice\u2014not just farmers. According to the Old Farmer's Almanac website, it is North America's most popular reference guide and oldest continuously published periodical. The premiere issue was published in 1792 during George Washington's first term as president. By the second year, circulation had tripled from 3,000 to 9,000. Back then, the Almanac cost only six pence (about nine cents). While there were other almanacs being published at that time, The Old Farmer's Almanac's first editor, Robert B. Thomas, used a complex series of natural cycles to devise a secret weather forecasting formula, which brought uncannily accurate results, traditionally said to be 80 percent accurate. (Even today, his formula is kept safely tucked away in a black tin box at the Almanac offices in Dublin, New Hampshire.) The Almanac is 230 years old this year, and has had many editors and changes, still, many farmers continue to use it today as a planning tool based on the accuracy of its long-term weather forecasts. Maybe I note that an abundance of cold flakiness will show up at our doors with gravitas, because we imagined that once we had a vaccine for the pandemic, life would snap back to normal fairly quickly, and it has neither snapped back quickly nor fairly. And maybe I note the anticipated \"more\" of winter because it's good to have something to plan for! I make a mental note: need more sweaters, colder and flakier incoming. I've been leading a series called \"I've Been Meaning to Ask\" that centers on these four questions: Where are you from? Where does it hurt? What do you need? Where do we go from here? I am finding the last three questions especially useful to gauge how I'm doing on any given day, as we live into this time of unknowing, when we are processing trauma individually and collectively, while the trauma itself continues to fall around us, gathering on our shoulders. Where does it hurt? Once we get through the flippant (where doesn't it hurt?), the given (my heart), and the vague (motions, palm up, at the air around me), it becomes clear that we hurt The Crazy Wisdom Weekly, January 7, 20227in innumerable places. Carrying a broken heart for the loss of a specific person is heavy lifting; carrying it for the loss of an entire way of life can be paralyzing. My eyes hurt from looking at screens too much. My need for connection aches when I stop looking. My serenity has diminished, replaced with a sense of depletion from choosing daily between the acute, the chronic, and the mundane. Hour by hour I try to discern what I can change, what I cannot, and the difference between the two. It hurts when I allow myself to remember the lives, the loves, and the sense of safety that has been lost in the seemingly endless divisions between us that seem to multiply like the mops that terrorized the sorcerer's apprentice in Fantasia . It hurts to see the righteous vilified and the villains venerated. It hurts to see the heroic nurses and doctors, pleading for relief, and it hurts that they have to do so. What do I need? I need less. Less stuff. Less lingering time. Less anxiety about making and breaking plans. Time is no longer punctuated by reliable routines: busy industry has been replaced by bare buildings, and people instinctively step away, rather than toward one another. I need to stop seeing dirty, discarded facemasks alongside the road, marring both gardens and gravel alike with reminders of a disease about which we need no reminders. I need communal song and hugs given with abandon and the uncovered smiles of seven-year-olds enamored with the space where a tooth had recently been. I need to stand shoulder to shoulder with theatergoers for long ovations and sit, satisfied, for rewarding encores. Where do we go from here? This is the hard one. It feels like we are in a plane that has not yet landed. We can't step out while mid-flight. And yet, beginning\u2014taking steps toward something\u2014 is essential to recovering from, and moving through, trauma. I propose we choose what we will move toward now , so that we do not freeze in fear when the colder, flakier days move in. I propose we begin to move from here to there, even if there is a moving target. I choose to move toward connection, wherever and however I can find it. I choose to notice what is full, at least as often as I notice what is empty. I choose to imagine more gathering spaces outside\u2014safe adaptations that give way to a more vital way of life and snow-laden paths that are cleared by those who can, without payment by those who can't, that lead to houses where those already warm, have sweaters to spare, and those whose bellies are full, fill those whose bellies are empty. From here, I propose we move toward a there we only see dimly, trusting that the process of moving will be an act of faith that sustains us. I propose we move together, toward a society that is fueled by faith. We will get through this. One way we do it is to inventory what hurts, what we need, and where we go from here on a regular basis. I propose we stock wood, and canned goods, and a few extra blankets. The Farmer's Almanac tell us that a flakier, colder winter is waiting in the wings. History tells us we will need one another to weather the storm.

Spontaneous remission, the placebo effect, and energy healingthese phenomena have baffled the medical community for decades. What do all these marvels tell us? \"Our current models of medicine fall short of understanding the depths of our human healing potential,\" says Dr. Shamini Jain. \"We are on the cusp of finally becoming awake to our human healing potential. A growing number of scientists are exploring a new patha true expansion of science joined with understandings from ancient concepts of spirituality.\" With Healing Ourselves, Dr. Jain presents a new vision of health and healing. Here she rejects the \"either-or\" thinking that has placed conventional medicine at odds with so-called alternative methodsoffering an integrated path based on sound scientific evidence and personal empowerment. Today more than ever, we realize that we must change the way we think about health careand our ability to heal ourselves. \"The good news is there is a way forward,\" teaches Dr. Jain. \"The flame that lights the path burns brighter than the darkness of ignorance and suffering we have found ourselves in.\" With Healing Ourselves, this inspiring teacher shares a holistic model of health that we have known in our hearts, all along, to be true.

After a two-year hiatus, I am thrilled to announce the launch of the \"Introduction to Homeopathy Class\" in an online digital format. The new virtual class offers an in-depth, beginner-level introduction to homeopathy that answers commonly asked questions and leaves the participant feeling confident about choosing remedies for themselves and their family. It features four hours of pre-recorded videos that can be accessed at your own pace, as well as downloadable reference materials that includes a free 60-page eBook (our Homeopathic Home Care Manual). The class covers the uses of 27 commonly called-for homeopathic remedies, all 12 biochemic cell salts, and recommendations for emergency first-aid. We explore the history of homeopathy, how remedies are created, how to select a remedy and potency, and how to dose. The focus of the class is to equip people with the knowledge to treat common acute symptoms at home, such as colds, coughs, and sore throats; flu and fever; headaches; minor infections; skin conditions like bug bites and rashes; stomach problems; minor injuries and burns; infant colic, teething, and more. In the past, the class was a 2-hour-long, in-person workshop led by the previous store manager, Mary Tillinghast. I have fond memories of helping people who had just finished the class and were excited as they purchased their first homeopathic kits. Mary was excellent at tailoring the shorter in-person class to the interests of the participants. For example, if there were new parents in the group, she would focus more on remedies for infants and children. We had received numerous requests in the past for remote learning opportunities but hadn't been able to make those accommodations. Near the end of 2019, I took over management of Castle Remedies when Mary retired. Just when I was looking forward to picking up where she left off with the Introduction to Homeopathy class, the pandemic began. Unfortunately, 2020 was a year of constant struggle and adaptation that didn't leave much room to develop my vision for the class. In 2021, I decided to take the class digital. It was finally time for the class to evolve and adapt as well. Personally, I'm a big fan of online classes - it's safe and socially distanced, it increases access, and I enjoy being able to press pause and continue during a time that's convenient. Creating an online class was its own adventure. There was a bit of trial-and-error as I taught myself how to record and edit videos and searched for the perfect online teaching platform. Several months of preparation included reading homeopathic history books and research literature, consulting with Dr. Lev Linkner, and reflecting on my own experiences with homeopathy\u2014both my personal experience using it for myself and family, as well as watching it improve the lives of thousands of happy customers at Castle Remedies. The online format gave me the freedom to go in-depth. One of my biggest goals for the class was to give students the opportunity to get to know each remedy more deeply. Every single remedy that we are introduced to becomes a new tool in our toolbox. With a well-selected remedy, we can head off acute minor illnesses, accelerate recovery, and prevent unnecessary doctor visits. The bulk of the class is spent directly on learning what these common medicines can help with. Participants are also equipped to seek information on the hundreds of remedies we couldn't cover in this introductory class. Homeopathy is a unique system of medicine that was invented over 200 years ago. It uses specially prepared remedies made from natural substances sourced from the animal, mineral, and vegetable kingdoms. Homeopathic remedies are safe, cheap, easy to take, and have no known side effects or drug interactions. They work by gently stimulating the body's natural healing abilities. They're safe for people of all ages, as well as pets! The challenging part can be choosing the correct remedy, as they are indicated on a case-by-case basis. Two people with the same diagnosed illness often need two completely different remedies based on their unique symptoms. There are some misunderstandings about homeopathy and misinformation spread by people who have never actually tried it. Once you experience a \"home run\" with a carefully selected remedy, you'll never doubt it again. My goal is to spread the word about homeopathy and make this information easily available and affordable. I want to inspire people to try homeopathy for themselves and encourage them to share their experiences. Castle Remedies has been around since 1983 and continues to provide access to over 1,000 homeopathic remedies. The Introduction to Homeopathy class is a great starting point for anyone who is curious about homeopathy. For details and class registration, visit www. CastleRemedies.com and click on \"Classes.\" Castle Remedies Offers New Castle Remedies Offers New Online Class for HomeopathyOnline Class for HomeopathyThe Crazy Wisdom Weekly, January 7, 202210By Janet Greenhut, MD I've noticed over my 40-year career as a physician that despite all the advances in medicine, one thing hasn't changed: patients continue to ask, \"Why doesn't my doctor listen to me?\" This is especially common for people who have chronic conditions. If it seems as though doctors and patients speak different languages, you're not imagining it. To medical professionals, what matters most is the state of the body, its dysfunction and pathology. How a disease affects the patient's being in the world is usually not top of mind to their physician. But patients with chronic conditions live in a world that, because of their illness, has become profoundly transformed. Having a body that no longer can be depended on to function as it used to, among other things, may constrain a person's freedom, adversely affect relationships, cause pain and other types of discomfort, change others' expectations of a what a person is capable of, and, above all, result in isolation. Problems with the body cannot be separated from the mind; our emotions, relationships, feelings about our predicament, and world view are all affected by our physical condition, and, therefore, are important to our overall health. Four years ago, I cofounded a nonprofit, Narrative Dimensions , with the intention of helping people with chronic illness explore the multiple dimensions of their illness experience and give voice to that experience. The workshop is based on the work of the philosopher Professor Havi Carel at the University of Bristol, UK. Her scholarly work in phenomenology draws on her own experience with a serious chronic illness and often focuses on the communication challenges that continue to plague the doctor-patient relationship. The basic question of phenomenology is: what is it like to live as humans in the world? Answering this question honestly forces us to identify assumptions we have about what our lives \"should\" be like and to replace those assumptions with descriptions of our authentic, unique lived experience. In the Living Well with Illness workshop, we offer participants the opportunity to express this unique experience through three activities: 1) telling their illness story to another person, without interruption, while they create a timeline of their illness; 2) answering questions they may not have considered before about things like changes to their relationship with the physical environment as well as with family and friends, feelings of loss of control, and their experience of time; and 3) accessing their nonverbal feelings through a guided artistic activity. Between activities participants come together to discuss with each other how these exercises affected them and their view of their illness. The power of the workshop lies in the connections that participants make with each other, even when they do not share a common diagnosis. People no longer feel so alone; they've communicated with others who have similar experiences, feelings, challenges, and aspirations. Their physical condition has not changed, but at the end of the workshop, there is an obvious difference in their body language, facial expressions, and energy level. Some reactions we've heard from participants are: \"It was powerful to be witnessed.\" \"It was a relief to talk about my illness.\" \"I'm learning about expanding my assumptions about having a chronic illness.\" \"It hurts, but it's helpful\u2014like a deep tissue massage.\" The coronavirus pandemic has forced us to come up with a way to provide the Living Well with Illness workshop safely without sacrificing the emotional and spiritual impact that it has on participants. It requires that we continue to honor our dedication to confidentiality, provide a safe space for people to divulge personal information, and offer as much of the full experience as possible. Yet, we must do all this while respecting people's willingness to spend a few hours online with a group of strangers. A definite benefit of an online workshop is that we can include participants from many more locations as well as those whose physical disabilities prohibit travel. We are excited by that prospect. In practical terms, we have had to adapt the workshop to an online format. We believe we have found online tools that will allow us to offer the same activities we do in person and do it in a shorter format (2.5 instead of 4 hours). We are in the testing phase right now and expect the online version will be available this year.

The Crazy Wisdom Weekly, January 7, 202215By Michelle Wilbert How did you get into music? I think the true mystery is how the music got into me. It has thrilled me since the beginning and is an inseparable part of my being. I think my mother probably saw that most clearly when I was a teenager and she called me \"a guitar with a kid attached.\" There's never been a \"Plan B.\" What are your favorite aspects of live performance? I love the unpredictable nature of it. Every audience is different and I guess, kinda like a really nice rug can, I love finding a way of tying the room together... But, most of all, playing live gives me a chance to throw myself as deeply as I can into the songs and give them everything I've got. After all these years it still feels like the first time. What have you been doing during the pandemic? What are you focused on now? Well, for me as a performing songwriter, the lack of work could have been really bad if there was any money in it to start with... But seriously, I was getting sorta bored of that smiling, folksy guy version of me that I only half-jokingly call \"Vanilla Mike.\" So, in the midst of all the hope and despair I've been working on a rock band project for 2022, as well as an acoustic summer tour with local educator and guitar great, Mike Vial. It should be a lot of fun. What is your guiding philosophy of life and art (music)? The creation of art and music are the divine \"Aha moments\" that spark the unmanifested into existence, giving the intellect something to think about. There would be no civilization as we know it without someone first wondering \"What if?\" and chasing that thought down. Oh, one more thing about art and music, and the expectations placed on you that somehow you're going to become rich and famous; My Grandma York used to say \"Just because you make a great cherry pie, doesn't mean you have to take it to the State Fair to try to win a prize.\" Make what you love. That's enough. www.mikegentrymusic.com CW Musician Spotlight with Mike Gentry https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KZBoosB3EPhoto by Peter SmithThe Crazy Wisdom Weekly, January 7, 202216Meditation, continued Silent Meditation Practice with Celeste Zygmont Weekly, Sunday 11 a.m.- 12 p.m.; Tuesdays 9 - 9:30 a.m. All levels of meditators are welcome.

Includes The Crazy Wisdom Weekly, January 7, 202219From Our Archives Cold Noses, Warm Teas: Comfort Tea for Winter By Peggy Alaniz The 2019 Farmer's Almanac has predicted another cold, snow- filled winter for the state of Michigan. Big Surprise! Having lived in Michigan most of my life the prediction seems average at best. A mild winter is more of a rarity than one with consistent below zero weather and a foot of snow every two days. I say embrace winter! It's a good time for winter sports such as skating, hockey, skiing, and sledding. Wintertime is tea time. After all, there is no better way to warm up from being outside in all the cold and yuck, than a warm, flavorful drink. Winter is a playground for various hot tea combinations. Some of the herbal teas, such as peppermint, can even spice up your coffee or cocoa. The winter is about enjoying the cold, and then finding comfort. So, I am going to suggest a few combinations of tea to try to heat things up. Any of them that use milk can also be made with almond, rice or coconut varieties due to allergy reasons, as well as to add depth of flavor. Chai Tea is my number one pick for the winter. Traditionally, the tea is made with black tea and a variety of spices, such as cinnamon, clove, ginger, cardamom, black pepper, and fennel. Usually, the tea combination is steeped then combined with hot milk and some sugar to taste. For me, cinnamon makes Chai sweet already, so I don't add any sugar to it. The spices are warming as well as comforting. Chai simply put is a smile in a cup. Not only is the tea delicious it also has amazing health benefits. Chai tea has been known to help reduce blood sugar levels, aid digestion, and it works to help alleviate inflammation. Cambric Tea is made from milk with some sugar and a little bit of tea. Some people make the tea prior to adding the milk. As a former barista I usually steep the tea in the hot milk. The flavor of tea used should be very mild. Traditionally, a Cambric tea should be mild because it is often referred to as nursery or infant tea. My favorite Cambric is one made with Earl Grey tea. However, any flavor of tea will work, even Matcha with a bit of cane sugar or honey. For me a Cambric is an ideal way to drink Matcha tea, which tends to be quite strong and even medicinal. Overall, Matcha contains many health benefits such as help with weight loss, type two diabetes, heart health, and even cancer.Finally, tea can be used to make a heck of a good hot toddy. On a cold winter night sometimes you need something a little extra to help warm things up. One of my favorite hot toddy's combines whisky with Earl Grey tea. The citrus notes found in the tea complement a good whiskey. So, I leave you with a Hot Toddy Recipe. Enjoy the snow with a nice cup of hot tea in hand! Earl Grey Hot Toddy Recipe 2 to 2 \u00bd cups of hot water, not boiling. You want it hot enough to drink, but not scald yourself 1 tablespoon of orange juice 2 tablespoons of your favorite whiskey, rum, or spirit 1 slice of orange 1 cinnamon stick 1 bag of Earl Grey tea, or approx. one to two tablespoons of loose leaf tea in tea infuser Combine the hot water with the Earl Grey tea. Allow tea to steep for one to two minutes, or until it has reached a desired color. Remove tea and add orange juice, cinnamon stick, whiskey, and an orange slice to garnish. Drink and enjoy.
