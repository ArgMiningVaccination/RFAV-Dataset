Developing adjuvant therapies which could prevent the virus from binding to cells may impair viral infection. This study produces a traditional Chinese medicine formula, Jing Guan Fang (JGF), based on ancient medical texts, and examines the efficacy and the mechanism by which JGF prevents viral infections. JGF reduces COVID-19 like symptoms. Functional studies show that JGF inhibits the formation of syncytium and reduces the formation of viral plaque. JGF is not toxic in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, JGF induces lysosomal-dependent ACE2 degradation and suppresses mRNA the protein levels of TMPRSS2 in human lung WI-38 and MRC-5 cells. Mice that inhale JGF exhibit reduced ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein levels in lung tissues. Together, these findings suggest that JGF may improve the COVID-19 like symptoms and inhibit viral infection. Moreover, JGF may be applicable as an adjuvant preventive strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection in addition to the use of vaccines.

FIGURE 1 The inhibitory activity of JGF on the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and ACE2 receptor. (A) Validation of the cytotoxicity of JGF. BHK-21 and Calu-3 cells were treated with indicated amounts of JGF and cell viability was examined by LDH assay. The control group represented the non-treatment group, serving as a negative control. The treatment with Triton-100 was used as a positive control. The data were presented as the mean \u00b1 SD; error bars indicated SD. n. s indicated non-significant, compared to the control group. (B) The expression of ACE2 in Calu-3 cells were treated with 40 g/ml of JGF was analyzed by Western blot assay (upper panel). The level of ACE2 expression was quantified after normalization with -tubulin. The quantification analysis from three independent experiments was shown in bottom panel. * represents p < 0.05. (C) The cell-cell fusion of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-expressing BHK cells and ACE2-expressing Calu-3 cells was visualized in the presence of indicated amounts of JGF. (D) The formation of syncytium was quantified for various concentrations of JGF. Compared with the control, syncytium formation was significantly inhibited after 20-80 g/ml JGF treatments. * represents p < 0.05.

WI-38 (A) and MRC-5 (B) cells were treated with various low concentrations of JGF (0-20 g/ml) for 48 and 72 h. Each group of JGF-treated samples was normalized against an untreated control. Cell viability was determined using a crystal violet assay. Data were representative of three separated experiments and were presented as the mean \u00b1 SD; error bars indicated SDs.

FIGURE 3 JGF induces lysosome dependent degradation of ACE2. (A) WI-38 and MRC-5 cells were treated with three dosages of JGF (0-20 g/ml) for 3 and 24 h. Western blotting was subsequently performed with whole cell lysates to detect expression of ACE2. Actin was used as the internal control. (B) Quantification of the intensities of the bands of ACE2 was representative of three separate determinations using ImageJ (National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD, United States). The data were presented as the mean \u00b1 SD; error bars indicated SD. Significant differences were shown (* p < 0.05 compared to the control group).

Right panel: The levels of ACE2 in the three-independent experiments were quantified by ImageJ and the results were presented as the mean \u00b1 SD; error bars indicate SDs. Significant differences were shown (* p < 0.05 compared to the control DMSO group).
