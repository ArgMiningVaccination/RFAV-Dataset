CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/28/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 1 Table of Contents Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? ..................................................................................... 3 The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. SARS -CoV-2 is the cause of coronavi rus disease 19 (COVID -19). Identifying the infectious dose for humans by the various routes through which individuals become infected is critical to the effective development of computational models to predict risk, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and effective decontamination strategies. Animal studies are a plausible surrogate. Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? ...................................................... 4 SARS- CoV-2 is passed easily between humans, likely through close contact with relatively large droplets and possibly through smaller aerosolized par ticles. Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others before they have symptoms. Undetected cases play a major role in transmission, and most cases are not reported. Identifying the contribution of asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic transmission is important for implementing control measures. Additionally, the relative contribution s of different infection sources - fomites, droplets, aerosols , and potentially feces - are unknown. Host Range - How many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species to species? ......................................................... 5 SARS- CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the identity of the SARS -CoV-2 inter mediate host is unknown. SARS- CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. To date, ferrets, hamsters, cats, and primates have been s hown to be susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection. Cats can transmit infection to other cats. It is unknown whether these animals can transmit infection to humans. Several animal models have been developed to recreate human- like illness, though to date they have been infected with high dose exposures. Lower dose studies may better replicate human disease acquisition. Incubation Period - How long after infection do symptoms appear? Are people infectious during this time? .......................... 6 The majority of individuals develop symptoms within 14 days of exposure. For most people, it takes at leas t 2 days to develop symptoms, and on average symptoms develop 5 days after exposure. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onset. Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. The incubation period is well -characterized. Patients may be infectious, however, for days before symptoms develop. Clinical Presentation - What are the signs and symptoms of an infected person? ................................................................... 7 Many COVID -19 cases are asymptomatic. Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group. Older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death. Current modeling suggests the overall case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID -19 is approximately 2.4%,19 but varies substantially by patient age and underlying comorbidities. Evidence suggests that African Americans are at elevated risk of severe symptoms. Additional data on vulnerable subpopulations is needed. Children of all ages are susceptible to COVID -19,91 though generally show milder63, 170 or no symptoms. The true case fatality rate is unknown, as the exact number of cases is uncertain. Testing priorities a nd case definitions vary by location. Protective Immunity - How long does the immune response provide protection from reinfection? ........................................ 8 Infected patients show productive immune responses, however more data is needed. Currently, there is no evidence that recovered patients can be reinfected with SARS -CoV-2. Understanding the duration of protective immunity is limited by small sample sizes. Animal models are plausible surrogates. Additional research to quantify the risk of reinfection after weeks, months, and years is needed. Clinical Diagnosis - Are there tools to diagnose infected individuals? When during infection are they effective? .................... 9 Diagnosis relies on identifying the genetic signature of the virus in patient nose, throat, or sputum samples. These tests ar e relatively accurate. Confirmed cases are still underreported. Validated serological (an tibody) assays are being developed to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/28/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 2 In general, PCR tests appear to be sensitive and specific, though confirmation of symptoms via chest CT is recommended. The sensitivity and specificity of serological testing methods is variable, and additional work is needed to determine factors that affect test accuracy. Medical Treatments - Are there effective treatments? ...........................................................................................................10 Treatment for COVID -19 is primarily supportive care including ventilation if necessary.112, 179 Currently, there is no broadly effective pharmaceutical treatment . Numerous clinical trials are ongoing , but results are preliminary.32, 71 In general, the efficacy of various therapeutic options for COVID -19 is unknown, though clinical trial results are beginning to be released. Vaccines - Are there effective vaccines? ................................................................................................................................. 11 Work is ongoing to develop a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine in human and ani mal trials. No preliminary results are available. Phase 2 Trials (initial testing for efficacy, continued testing for safety) No preliminary vaccine results for humans have been released. Non- pharmaceutical Interventions - Are public health control measures effective at reducing spread? ................................. 12 Broad -scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders are effective at reducing movement, and modeling shows evidence that they reduce transmission. The effect of relaxing control measures is unknown, and research is needed to help plan for easing of restrictions. As different US states have implemented differing control measures at various times, a comprehensive analysis of social distancing efficacy has not yet been conducted. Environmental Stability - How long does the agent live in the environment? .........................................................................13 SARS- CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for at least 3 days and on the surface of a surgical mask for up to 7 days depending on conditions. If aerosolized intentionally, SARS -CoV-2 is stable for at least several hours. The seasonality of COVID -19 transmission is unknown. Additional testing on SARS -CoV-2, as opposed to surrogate viruses, is needed to support initial estimates of stability. Decontamination - What are effective methods to kill the agent in the environment? ..........................................................14 Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactiv ating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. Methods for decontaminating N95 masks have been approved by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Additional decontamination studies, particularly with regard to PPE and other items in short supply, are needed. PPE - What PPE is effective, and who should be using it? .......................................................................................................15 The effectiveness of PPE for SARS -CoV-2 is currently unknown, and data from other related coronaviruses are used for guidance. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even wit h recommended PPE. Most PPE recommendations have not been made on SARS -CoV-2 data, and comparative efficacy of different PPE for different tasks (e.g., intubation) is unknown. Identification of efficacious PPE for healthcare worker is critical due to their high rates of infection. Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used for attribution. ................................................................................16 All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. Identifying the intermediate species between bats and humans would aid in reducing potential spillover from a natural source. Wide sampling of bats, other wild animals, and humans is needed to address the origin of SARS -CoV-2. Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? ..................................................................................17 Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates substi tutions and mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Mutations and deletions in specific portions of the SARS -CoV-2 genome have not been linked to any changes in transmission or disease severity, though modeling work is attempting to identify po ssible changes. Research linking genetic changes to differences in phenotype (e.g., transmissibility, virulence, progression in patients) is needed.

What do we know? The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. SARS -CoV-2 is the cause of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID -19). Work using SARS -CoV-2 A total dose of approximately 700,000 plaque -forming units (PFU) of the novel coronavirus SARS - CoV-2 infected cynomolgus macaques via combination intratracheal exposure (106 TCID 50 total dose).224 Macaques did not exhibit clinical symptoms , but virus was shed from the nose and throat.224 Rhesus macaques are effectively infected with SARS -CoV-2 via the ocular conjunctival and intratracheal route at a of approximately 700,000 PFU (106 TCID 50).89 Rhesus macaques infected with -CoV-2 by the intranasal, intratracheal, oral and ocular routes combined recapitulate moderate disease observed in the majority of human cases.190 Ferrets infected with 316,000 TCID 50136 of SARS -CoV-2 by the intranasal route show similar symptoms to human disease.136, 218 Uninfected ferrets in direct contact with infected ferrets test positive an d show disease as early as 2 days post -contact .136 In one study, direct contact was required to transfer infection between ferrets ,136 however , transmission without direct contact was found in another study.218 Syrian Golden Hamsters in fected with 100,000 PFU via the intranasal route closely resemble human respiratory infection. Uninfected hamsters in close contact with infected hamsters show symptoms within 4 days of exposure.60 Domestic cats exposed to 100,000 PFU of SARS -CoV-2 via the intranasal route developed severe pathological symptoms including les ions in the nose, throat, and lungs.237 Younger cats exhibited more severe symptoms than older cats .237 Relat ed Coronaviruses The infectious dose for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS -CoV-1) in mice is estimated to be between 67 -540 PFU (average 240 PFU, intranasal route).86, 88 Genetically modified mice exposed intranasally to doses of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV) virus between 100 and 500,000 PFU show ed signs of infection. Infection with higher doses result ed in severe syndromes.14, 72, 154, 292 What do w e need to know? Identifying the infectious dose for humans by the various routes through which we become infected is critical to the effective development of computational models to predict risk, develop diagnostics and countermeasures , and effective decon tamination strategies.

How easily is it spread? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is passed easily between humans, likely through close contact with relatively large droplets and possibly through smaller aerosolized particles. Pandemic COVID -19 has caused 3,074,9 48 infections and 213, 273 deaths130 in at least 185 countries and territories (as of 4/28/2 020).51, 234, 269 In the US there are 994,625 confirmed SARS -CoV-2 cases acr oss all 50 US states, with 56,749 deaths (as of 4/28/2020).130 High -quality estimates of human transmissibility (R 0) range from 2.2 to 3.1 .175, 202, 221, 277, 291 SARS- CoV-2 is believed to spread through close contact and droplet transmission,55 with fomite transmission likely131 SARS- CoV-2 replicates in the upper respiratory tract (e.g., throat), and infectious virus is detectable in throat and lung tissue for at least 8 days .272 Conta mination of patient rooms with aerosolized SARS -CoV-2 in the human respirable range (0.25 - 2.5 m) indicates the potential for airborne transmission .166 To date infectious virus has not been isolated from aerosol samples.231 Contamination may be worse in intensive care rooms, with viral RNA detected up to 4 meters from patient beds.114 Limited evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 may be spread by conversation and exhalatio n in the absence of cough, however more work is needed.11, 153, 231 A preliminary study in China detailing a restaurant -associated outbreak supports aerosol transmission , though confirmation is needed.159 Experimentally infected ferrets were able to transmit SARS -CoV-2 to other ferrets by both direct contact (another ferret in same enclosure) as well as through the air (ferret s in an adjacent enclosure, separated by 10 cm).218 Several studies suggest that SARS -CoV-2 is not transmitted from mother to child during birth,65, 67, 233, 286 however larger studies are needed. Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others before they have symptoms. Pre-symptomatic294 or asymptomatic26 patients can transmit SARS -CoV-2. 12%93 of all cases are estimated to be due to asymptomatic transmission, and between 23%165 and 44%115 of infections may be caused by pre -symptomatic transmission . Asymptomati c and pre -symptomatic individuals have similar amounts of virus in the nose and throat compared to symptomatic patients.22 Individuals may be infectious for 1 -3 days prior to symptom onset ,260 and culturable virus has been found in individuals up to 6 days prior to symptom onset.22 Severe cases are more likely to transmit disease, and most new infections are within households of infected patients.171 In China, it is estimated that infected individuals transmit COVID -19 to 16. 3% of their household contacts.157 Undetected cases play a major role in transmission, and most cases are not reported. Models suggest up to 86% of early COVID -19 cases in China were undetected, and these infections were the source for 79% of reported cases.156 Models estimate that the true number of cases may be approximately 11 times grea ter than the reported number of cases in the UK,287 and 5 to 10 times greater than the reported number of cases in the US.132, 228 Preliminary estimates of the case reporting rate vary widely among countries, from roughly 1 reported case for every 3 actual cases (in Germany), to 1 in 149 (in China) .140 In Ohio, every inmate at each of three prisons was tested for COVID -19 regardless of symptoms. Infection rates were 2 2%-81%.78 Up to 96% of infected inmates were asymptomatic at the time of testing.239 What do we need to know? Identifying the contribution of asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic transmission is important for implementing control measures. Additionally, the relative contribution s of different infection sources - fomites, droplets, aerosols, and potentially feces - are unknown. Capability of SARS -CoV-2 to be transmitted by contact with fomites (phones, doorknobs, surfaces, clothing, etc.) - see also Experimental Stability Updated person to person transmission rates (e.g., R 0) as control measures take effect. Can individuals becom e re-infected with SARS -CoV-2? Is the R 0 estimate higher in healthcare or long -term care facilities? When will infections peak in various cities and countries? Are small -diameter (<5 m) aerosol exposures capable of infecting humans? How do infectious aerosols (small -diameter , <5 m) travel?

Can it transfer from species to species? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown. Early genomic analysis indicates similarity to SARS -CoV-1,298 with a suggested bat origin.5, 74, 298 Positive samples from the South China Seafood Market strongly suggests a wildlife source,57 though it is possible that the virus was circulating in humans before the disease was associated with the seafood market.31, 75, 281, 289 Analysis of SARS -CoV-2 genomes suggests that a non -bat intermediate species is responsible f or the beginning of the outbreak.223 The identity of the intermediate host remains unknown.158, 162- 163 Viruses similar to SARS -CoV-2 were present in pangolin samples collected several years ago.144 SARS -CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. Experiments show that SARS -CoV-2 Spike (S) receptor- binding domain binds the human cell rece ptor (ACE2) stronger than SARS -CoV-1,275 potentially explaining its high transmissibility . The same work suggests that differences between SARS -CoV-2 and SARS -CoV-1 Spike proteins may limit the therapeutic ability of SARS antibody treatments.275 Modeling of SARS -CoV-2 Spike and ACE2 proteins suggests that SARS -CoV-2 can bind and infect human, bat, civet, monkey and swine cells.254 Genetic and protein analysis of primates suggests that African and Asian primates are likely more susceptible to SARS -CoV-2, while South and Central American primates are likely less susceptible ,183 confirming that the SARS -CoV-2 host range is important for identifying potential animal reservoirs. Changes in proteolytic cleavage of the Spike protein can also affect cell entry and animal host range , in addition to receptor binding .184 To date, ferrets, hamsters, cats, and primates have been shown to be susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection. Cats c an transmit infection to other cats. It is unknown whether these animals can transmit infection to humans. Animal model studies suggest that Golden Syrian hamsters, primates, and ferrets may be susceptible to infection.60, 136 Domestic cats are susceptible to infection with SARS -CoV-2 (100,000 PFU via the intranasal route), and can transmit the virus to other cats via droplet or short -distance aerosol.237 Dogs exposed to SARS- CoV-2 produced anti-SARS -CoV-2 antibodies but exhibited no clinical symptoms.237 Wild cats (tigers)259 can be infected with SARS -CoV-2, although their ability to spread to humans is unknown.177, 290 Two cases have been confirmed of pet domestic cats infected with SARS -CoV-19.50 Ducks, chickens, and pigs remained uninfected after experimental SARS -CoV-2 (30,000 CFU for ducks and chickens, 100,000 PFU for pigs, all via intranasal route).237 There is currently no evidence that SARS -CoV-2 infects livestock.128 What do we need to know? Several animal models have been developed to recreate human -like illness, though to date they have been infected with high dose exposures . Lower dose studies may better replicate human disease acquisition . What is the intermediate host(s)? What are the mu tations in SARS -CoV-2 that allowed human infection and transmission? What other animals can SARS -CoV-2 infect (e.g., pet dogs, potential wildlife reservoirs)? Can infected animals transmit to humans (e.g., pet cats to humans)?

Are people infectious during this time? What do we know? The majority of individuals develop symptoms within 14 days of exposure. For most people, it takes at least 2 days to deve lop symptoms, and on average symptoms develop 5 days after exposure. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onset. Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. The best current estimate of the COVID -19 incubation period is 5.1 days, with 99% of individuals exhibiting symptoms within 14 days of exposure.149 Fewer than 2.5% of infected individuals show symptoms sooner than 2 days after exposure.149 Indiv iduals can test positive for COVID -19 even if they lack clinical symptoms.26, 59, 112, 245, 294 Individuals can be infectious while asymptomatic ,55, 226, 245, 294 and asymptomatic individuals can have similar amounts of virus in their nose and throat as symptomatic individuals .300 Peak infectiousness may be during the incubation period, one day before symptoms develop .115 Infectious virus has been cultured in patients up to 6 days before the development of symptoms.22 Infectious period is unknown, but possibly up to 10 -14 days .10, 156, 234 Asymptomatic individuals are estimated to be infectious for a median of 9.5 days.123 On average, there are approximately 493 to 7.5155 days between symptom onset in successive cases of a single transmission chain (i.e., the serial interval) . Based on data from 339 transmission chains in China, the mean serial interval is 5.29 days.92 Most hospitalized individuals are admitted within 8 -14 days of symptom onset.296 What do we need to know? The incubation period is well -characterized. Patients may be infectious, however, for days before sympt oms develop. What is the average infectious period during which individuals can transmit the disease?

What do we know? Many COVID -19 cases are asymptomatic. Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group. Older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death. Estimates of the propor tion of individuals with asymptomatic infections vary . Up to 96% of COVID - 19 infected inmates in an Ohio prison were asymptomatic at testing,239 as were approximately 60% of sailors who tested positive on the USS Theodore Roosevelt,240 and 100% of homeless individuals who tested positive in a Boston, MA , homeless shelter.225 Some of these individuals will later develop symptoms. For instance, 56% of COVID -19 patients in a nursing home were asymptomatic upon initial positive testing , but 89% of those had developed symptoms one week later.22 Studies that test entire populations repeatedly over time and link those tests to the presence or absence of symptoms are necessary . The majority of symptomatic COVID -19 cases are mild (81%, n=44,000 cases) .245 Initial COVID -19 symptoms include fever (87.9% overall, but only 44 -52% present with fever initially),20, 112 cough (67.7%),112 fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, and reduced lymphocyte count.56, 62, 124 Additionally, the US CDC lists chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and loss of taste or smell285 as possible COVID -19 symptoms.56 Almost 50% of hospitalized patients in the US have either hypertension or obesity, and approximately 25% experienced diarrhea or nausea and vomiting.106 In two large New York patient cohorts, levels of comorbidities were higher than in other countries, contributing to mortality .21, 200 Complications include acute respiratory distress (ARDS, 17 -29% of hospitalized patients, leading to death in 4 -15% of cases),66, 124, 255 pneum onia,199 cardiac injury (20%),238 secondary infection, kidney damage ,241 arrhythmia, sepsis, and shock.112,124,255, 296 Most deaths are caused by respiratory failure or respiratory failure combined with myocardial (heart) damage.227 Approximately 15% of hospi talized patients are classified as severe,112, 245 and approximately 5% of patients are admitted to the ICU.112, 245 Patient d eterioration can be rapid .109 Mortality rates of patients requiring mechanical ventilation vary substantially : approximately 65% in the UK,127 30% in the state of Georgia ,24 and 24.5% in New York City ,219 and a large percentage ( 72.2% ) remained in the hospital . Studies most commonly find links between disease severity and patient age, lymphocyte counts, hypertension, lactate dehydrogenase, C -reactive protein, and history of any pre -existing condition. 206 Additionally, elevated D -dimer levels may correspond to s evere illness.125 Ocular symptoms such as conjunctivitis have been seen in severe COVID -19 cases ,279 and blood clots appear more common in COVID -19 patients in intensive care than the general population.138 Current modeling suggests the overall case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID -19 is approximately 2.4% ,19 but varies substantially by patient age and underlying comorbidities. The CFR depends on comorbidities . Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and respiratory conditions all increase the CFR.245, 296 The CFR increases with age . Individuals >60 are at higher risk of death, and the CFR for individuals >85 is between 10 and 27%.245, 296 In the US, 34% of hospitalizations have been individuals younger than 44 years old.7 Over 60% of confirmed fatalities have been male.245 Evidence suggests that African Americans are at elevated risk of severe symptoms . Additional data on vulnerable subpopulations is needed . A review of US COVID -19 patients revealed that African Americans are disproportionately represented in hospitalized populations (comprising 33% of hospitalized patients compared to only 18% of the base study population).106 Additional research highlighting potentially vulnerable subpopulations is needed. Children of all ages are susceptible to COVID -19,91 though generally show milder63, 170 or no symptoms . Up to 28% of children may be asymptomatic.209 Severe symptoms in children are possible,164 and infant deaths have been recorded.42, 170 What do we need to know? The true case fatality rate is unknown, as the exact number of cases is uncertain. Testing priorities and case definitions vary by location . How long does it take for infected individuals to recover outside of a healthcare setting? Are pregnant women at greater risk of complications during labor?161 What proportion of infected individuals are asymptomatic?

What do we know? Infected patients show productive immune responses, however more data is needed. In a limited study (n=9), hospitalized patients shed high levels of infectious virus for 7 days via the nasal -pharyngeal route . 50% of patients produced antibodies within 7 days, and all patients produced antibodies by 14 days. Antibody production did not correlate wit h lower viral load.272 In a larger study (n=175), most patients developed neutralizing antibodies within 10 -15 days after disease onset. Elderly patients had significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than younger patients.276 Based on one patient, a productive immune response is generated and sustained for at least 7 days.246 Previous studies on coronavi rus immunity suggest that neutralizing antibod ies may wane after several years .44, 278 More data is needed. A small subset of COVID -19 patients in China (8%) did not develop a serological response to infection , though the potential for reinfection in these patients is unknown.276 Similarly, between 16.7% (for IgG) and 51.7% (for IgM) of patients in a separate study did not exhibit any immune response, in terms of two types of antibodies.243 In a study of 221 COVID -19 patients, levels of two types of antibodies ( Immunoglobulins M and G) were not associated with the severity of symptoms.122 However, in a smaller study, patients with severe disease showed stronger antibody responses than those with non- severe symptoms. Currently, there is no evidence that recovered patients can be reinfected with SARS -CoV-2. Experimentally infected macaques were not capable of being reinfected after their primary infection resolved. 28 According to the WHO, there is no evidence of re -infection with SARS -CoV-2 after recovery.148 Patients can test positive via PCR for up to 37 days after symptoms appear ,296 and after recovery and hospital discharge.145 The ability of these individuals to infect others is unknown. Similarly , there is no evidence that recovered patients are protected against reinfection with SARS - CoV-2.265 Additional research is required before any conclusions can be drawn about the duration of protective immunity after SARS -CoV-2 infection.15 What do we need to know? Understanding the duration of protective immunity is limited by small sample sizes . Animal models are plausible surrogates. Additional research to quantify the risk of reinfection after weeks, months, and years is needed. How long does the immune response last? Is there evidence of waning immunity? Can humans become reinfected? Are patients who test positive weeks after discharge from hospital capable of transmitting infection? How does the patient immune response vary by age or disease severity ? How do different components of the immune response contribute to long -term protection?

These tests are relatively accurate. Confirmed cases are still underreported. The US CDC has expanded testing criteria to include symptomatic patients at clinician discretion.30 PCR protocols and primers have been widely shared internationally.49, 77, 155, 236, 264, 270 PCR-based diagnostic assays are unable to differentiate between active and inactive virus. Broad testing in Iceland suggests that approximately 50% of those who test ed positive were asymptomatic at the time of testing .23, 187 A combination of pharyngeal (throat) RT -PCR and chest tomography is the most effective diagnostic criteria ( correctly diagnose 91.9% of infections).216 A single th roat swab detects 78.2% of infections , and duplicate tests identify 86.2% of infections.216 PCR tests using saliva were better able to detect SARS -CoV-2 RNA than those using nasopharyngeal swab s, and may be useful for self, at -home sampling.280 Additional validation is needed. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs may be less effective as diagnostic specimens than sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ,257 although evidence is mixed .272 RT-PCR tests can identify asymptomatic cases; SARS -CoV-2 infection was identified in 2/114 individuals cleared by clinical assessment.119 Combination RT -PCR and serology (antibody) testing may increase the ability to diagnose patients with mild symptoms, or identify patients at higher risk of severe disease.293 The FDA released an Emergency Use Aut horization enabling laboratories to develop and use tests in-house for patient diagnosis.101 Updated tests from the US CDC are available to states.49, 55 Multiple rapid or real -time test kits have been produced by universities and industry, including the Wuhan Institute of V irology,82 BGI,34 Cepheid ,253 Abbot,99 and Mesa Biotech.35 The US CDC is developing serological tests to determine what proportion of the population has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. 134 A rapid antibody tes t by Cellex is now authorized by the FDA .118, 261 Home tests are being developed ; however none are FDA approved, nor are they useable as a diagnostic .191-192, 201 Validated serological (antibody) assays are being developed to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. Researchers found high specificity in a number of enzyme- linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) , though sample sizes for SARS -CoV-2 patients were small.194 Additional research has shown high variability in the ability of tests (ELISA and lateral flow assays) by different manufacturers to accurately detect positive and negative cases (sensitivity and specificity, respectively).147, 262 Lateral flow assays may be less reliable than ELISA.12 In one German town, serological testing has been used to identify the percent of the population already exposed to SARS -CoV-2 (14%), which can assist in public health response planning. 214 Preliminary serological studies in Santa Clara and Los Angeles , California , estimated that 2.5-4.1% of the population has already been exposed to SARS -CoV-2 since the first confirmed cases in January ,33, 178 which is between 28 and 85 times greater than official reports. There are issues, however, with non -random study populations ,33 as well as false positive rates of the diagnostic tests themselves.178 The false positive rate of the diagnostic assay used may account for a substantial portion of the reported infections ,33 particularly if the true proportion of positive patients is low. In New York, initial serological testing ind icates that 13.9% of the population has been exposed to COVID -19, approximately 10 time s greater than the number of reported cases.2 This is in line with other underreporting estimates in the US.132, 228 Serological evidence of exposure does not indicate protective immunity. What do we need to know? In general, PCR tests appear to be sensitive and specific, though confirmation of symptoms via chest CT is recommended . The sensitivity and specificity of serological testing methods is variable, and additional work needs to be done to determine factors that affect test accuracy. How accurate are clinical diagnoses compared to genetic tests? How effective are different swab specimens as diagnostic samples? How many serological tests need to be done to obtain an accurate picture of underlying exposure? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/28/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 10 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Medical Treatments - Are there effective treatments? What do we know? Treatment for COVID -19 is primarily supportive care including ventilation if necessary.112, 179 Currently, there is no broadly effective pharmaceutical treatment . Numerous clinical trials are ongoing, but results are preliminary.71,32 Two WHO -backed clinical trials ( Solidarity and Discovery )142 include remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, ritonavir/lopinavir, and ritonavir/lopinavir and interferon -beta.142 A study of 181 COVID -19 patients in France found no benefit of hydroxych loroquine (600 mg/day) in terms of the need for intensive care or mortality compared to a control group.174 Additionally, 9% of the treatment group suffered cardiac arrhythmias that necessitated premature withdrawal of treatment, though it is possible these pa tients received antibiotics concurrently.174 A study of US veterans treated with hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin found no benefit to either treatment compared to a control group, in terms of reduced mortality or risk of ventilation .173 The same study identified an increased risk of mortality in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone.173 Early results from a randomized clinical trial found that high doses (600 mg, twice per day) of chloroquine diphosphate were associated with toxicity and lethality in patients with severe COVID - 19. 36 The trial did not have a large enough sample size to assess chloroquine treatment efficacy.36 Preliminary remdesivir results are mixed . Remdesivir given to macaques within 12 hours of SARS - CoV-2 inoculation reduced clinical symptoms and viral replication in the lower respiratory tract compared to controls. Viral replication in the upper respiratory tract was not reduced, suggesting a clinical benefit but limited ability to reduce transmission.271 In humans, c ompassionate use of remdesivir in critically ill patients resulted in improvements in oxygen saturation and reduced the need for mechanical ventilation , though the data were not compared to a control group.110 Similarly, a necdotal reports suggest some benefit of remdesivir in humans with severe disease, though the corresponding clinical trial lacks a control group and has not reported final results.103 However, a necdotal reports from a randomized trial in China found no benefit of remdesivir, in terms of reduction in symptom duration or mortality in severely ill COVID -19 patients.4 Full results from this and o ther trials are needed. Additional clinical trials involving anti -inflammatory drugs are recruiting patients (interleukin- 6 inhibitors, sarilumab3 and tocilizumab8). Clinical trials are underway with famotidine37 (a heartburn reliever) and mesenchymal st romal cells derived from convalescent patient bone marrow121 (to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome ). Limited, preliminary evidence from clinical trials supports the efficacy of favipiravir64 (which has since been approved to treat COVID -19 in China ),1 tocilizumab,282 intravenous immunoglobulin,46 and hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin (though see above for negative results from a larger trial) .107, 167 A press release suggests treatment with tocilizumab reduced COVID -19 mortality and the need for ventilators in a randomized trial.9 Additional work is needed. Limited, preliminary research found no efficacy from combination ritonavir and lopinavir.45 Passive antibody therapy (convalescent serum )47 is being given to patients (FDA Investigational New Drug approval).100 In a small trial (5 patients),235 convalescent sera administration was follow ed by clinical improvement.235 Corticosteroids are commonly given to COVID -19 patients296 at risk of ARDS,283 but their use is not recommended by the US CDC.52 A small (n=115 patients) trial in China found no ben efit of corticosteroids in terms of admission to the ICU or death.256 A blood -cleaning device has been approved by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization to filter cytokines from severely ill COVID -19 patients.186 For patients with ARDS, prone positioning (placing patients on their stomachs and sides rather than their backs) may aid oxygenation and reduce mortality.27, 113 What do we need to know?

What do we know? Work is ongoing to develop a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine in human and animal trials. No preliminary results are available. Multiple entities are working to produce a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine,16 including HHS/NIH/NIAID,116, 152 CEPI, Moderna Therapeutics, Sciences,5-6, 193 Sanofi,38 and Johnson and Johnson.133 Vaccine candidates undergoing clinical trial are liste d below. Phase 2 Trials (initial testing for efficacy, continued testing for safety) : China's CanSino is the first to complete Phase 1 safety trials of their adenovirus type5 vector -based Sars-CoV-2 vaccine, Ad5 -nCoV, and has advance d to Phase 2 human tr ials.160 Phase 1 Trials (initial testing for safety) : Sinovac Biotech has reported that their inactivated virus vacci ne shows protective effects in rhesus macaques, particularly at high doses.105 The vaccine is currently in phase 1 clinical trials.73 Moderna has a Phase 1 trial underway based on its mRNA platform, mRNA- 1273, and planning to start Phase 2 tr ials in the coming weeks .188 Inovio had their IND approved by the FDA and have started their Phase 1 clinical tri als on their DNA vaccine candidate INO- 4800 .229 Shenzhen Geno -Immune Medical Institute is testing its aAPC182 and lentiviral181 vaccines in Phas e 1 clinical trials .

What do we know? Broad- scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders are effective at reducing movement, and modeling shows evidence that they reduce transmission. Social distancing and other policies are estimated to have reduced COVID -19 spread by 44% in Hong Kong81 and reduced spread in China.139, 168 Modeling demonstrates that multifaceted restrictions and q uarantines in China reduced the R 0 of SARS- CoV-2 from greater than 3 to less than 1 between January 23rd and February 5th.198 Models indicate that a combination of school closures, work restrictions, and other measures are required to effectively limit transmission.102 Preliminary modeling results from Japan suggest that school closures alone were not sufficient to limit COVID -19 spread, though the school closures in question only applied to students between 6 and 18 years of age. 129 Globally, there is some evidence that implementing social distancing measures has reduced the amount individuals travel, though the data are based on planned rather than actual trips.176 Mobility in major US cities declined after each public health intervention implemented.146 Restrictive lockdowns in China are estimated to have reduced disease transmission within only a few days.299 Non-pharmaceutical interventions i n China did not reduce transmission equally across all groups; transmission rates in younger individuals, particularly infants, as well as hospital workers continued to increase even while overall transmission rates declined.198 The effect of relaxing control measures is unknown, and research is needed to help plan for easing of restrictions. Modeling indicates that COVID -19 is likely to become endemic in the US population, with regular, periodic outbreaks, and that additional social or physical distancing measures may be required for several years to keep ca ses below critical care capacity in absence of a vaccine or effective therapeutic. 137 Results depend critically on the duration of immunity after exposure.137 Modeling suggests that premature lifting of social distancing measures will substantially increase the number of local COVID -19 cases in Wuhan, China. 207 Similarly, forecasts in the US estimate a resumption of exponential case growth if social distancing measures are relaxed.83 In the UK, modelers are assessing the efficacy of rolling interventions, whereby social distancing measures are put into place every few weeks to keep healthcare demand below a critical point.287 A modeling study using Chinese data estimate d the impact of relaxing social distancing measures after an initial reduction in disease transmission. Results suggest that if R 0 is allowed to rise above 1, tightening controls may not be enough to keep transmission low; rather, additional effort would be needed to drive R 0 below 1 again, suggesting that carefully balancing control measures to maintain R 0 below 1 would be more efficient than allowing R 0 to increase again in the fir st place.150 Robust contact tracing and case finding may be needed to control COVID -19 in the US, but would require additional staff and resources to conduct effectively.258 A model suggests that r educing public contacts is more important for controlling spread than reducing private (e.g ., in-home) contacts.180 The WHO has released guidelines on public health strategy, focusing on controlling transmission, ensuring public health capacity is robust, and engaging local communities.263 Johns Hopkins released a report outlining how to re -open certain categories of activities (e.g., schools, restaurants , events) while reducing COVID -19 risk; the report also ranks certain activities by their contact intensity, number of contacts, and the potential to modify them to reduce risk.222 What do we need to know? As different US states have implemented differing control measures at various times, a comprehensive analysis of social distancing efficacy has not yet been conducted. How many cases in the US have been averted due to social distancing restrictions? How long does it take for various non -pharmaceutical interventions to show effects? What are effective surrogate measures of social distancing efficacy (e.g., reduction in travel, contact, traffic, etc.)? What are plausible options for relaxing social distancing and other intervention measures without resulting in a resurgence of COVID -19 cases?

What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for at least 3 days and on the surface of a surgical mask for up to 7 days depending on conditions. If aerosolized intentionally, SARS -CoV-2 is stable for at least several hours. The seasonality of COVID -19 transmission is unknown. SARS -CoV-2 Data SARS- CoV-2 can persist on plastic and metal surfaces between 3 days (21 -23oC, 40% RH)251 and 7 days (22oC, 65% RH). Infectious virus can be recovered from a surgical mask after 7 days (22oC, 65% RH).69 SARS- CoV-2 has an aerosol half -life 2.7 hours (particles <5 m, tested at 21 -23oC and 65% RH).251 SARS- CoV-2 is susceptible to heat treatment (70oC) but can persist for at least two weeks at refrigerated temperatures (4oC).69, 213 SARS- CoV-2 genetic material (RNA) was detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic cruise ship passenger rooms up to 17 days after cabins were vacated . The infectiousness of this material is not known.189 In a preliminary study, SARS -CoV-2 stability was enhanced when present with bovine serum albumin, which is commonly used to represent sources of protein found in human sputum.203 No strong evidence exists showing a reduction in transmission with seasonal increase in temperature and humidity.172 Model ing suggests that even accounting for potential reductions in transmission due to weather and behavioral changes, public health interventions will still need to be in effect to limit COVID -19 transmission.185 Surrogate Coronavirus data : Studies sugges t that other coronaviruses can survive on non -porous surfaces up to 9 -10 days (MHV, SARS- CoV) ,48, 61 and porous surfaces for up to 3 -5 days (SARS -CoV)95 in air conditioned environments (20-25oC, 40 -50% RH). Coronavirus survival tends to be higher at lower temperatures and lower relative humidity (RH),48, 61, 211, 252 though infectious virus can persist on surfaces for several days in typical office or hospital conditions .252 SARS can persist with trace infectivity for up to 28 days at refrigerated temperatures (4oC) on surfaces.48 One hour after aerosolization approximately 63% of airborne MERS virus remained viable in a simulated office environment (25oC, 75% RH) .208 Porous hospital materials, including paper and cotton cloth, maintain infectious SARS -CoV for a shorter time than non -porous material.143 What do we need to know?

SARS -CoV-2 Alcohol -based hand rubs are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2.141 Chlorine bleach (1%, 2%), 70% ethanol and 0.05% chlorhexidine are effective aga inst live virus in lab tests.68 Twice -daily cleaning with sodium dichloroisocyanurate decontaminated surfaces in COVID -19 patient hospital rooms.195 EPA has released a list of SARS -CoV-2 disinfectants, but solutions were not tested on live virus.13 Other Coronaviruses Chlorine -based267 and ethanol -based76 solutions are recommended. Heat treatment (56oC) is sufficient to kill coronaviruses,211, 295 though effectiveness depends partly on protein in the sample.211 70% ethanol, 50% isopropanol, sodium hypochlorite (0.02% radiation and CCV).230 Ethanol -based biocides effectively disinfect coronaviruses dried on surfaces, including ethanol containing gels similar to hand sanitizer.126, 273 Surface spray disinfectants such as Mikrobac, Dis mozon, and Korsolex are effective at reducing infectivity of the closely related SARS -CoV after 30 minutes of contact.210 Coronaviruses may be resistant to heat inactivation for up to 7 days when stabilized in stool.247-248 Coronaviruses are more stable in matrixes such as respiratory sputum.94 Methods for decontaminating N95 masks have been approved by the FDA under an E mergency U se Authorization (EUA). Researchers have identified four methods capable of decontaminating N95 respirators while maintaining physical integrity (fit factor): UV radiation, heating to 70oC, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP).104 Ethanol (70%) was associated with loss of physical integrity.104 Hydrogen peroxide vapor (VHP) can repeatedly decontaminate N95 respirators.220 Devices capable of decontaminating 80,000 masks per day have been granted Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA.97 The FDA has issued a n Emergency Use Authorization for a system capable of decontaminating 10 N95 masks at a time using devices already present in many US hospitals.39 What do we need to know?

What do we know? The effectiveness of PPE for SARS -CoV-2 is currently unknown, and data from other related coronaviruses are used for guidance. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. Healthcare worker illnesses (over 1,000 )245 demonstrates human -to-human transmission despite isolation, PPE, and infection control.232 Risk of transmission to healthcare workers appears high, with up to 20% of healthcare workers in Lombardy, Italy becoming infected.215 Over 50% of US healthcare workers infected with COVID -19 report work in a healthcare setting as their single source of exposure .43 \"Healthcare personnel entering the room [of SARS -CoV-2 patients] should use standard precautions, contact precautions, air borne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield) .\"53 WHO indicates healthcare workers should wear clean long -sleeve as well as gloves.266 Respirators (NIOSH -certified N95, EUFFP2 or equivalent) are recommended for those dealing with possible aerosols .267 Additional protection, such as a Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) with a full hood, should be considered for high- risk procedures (i.e., intubation, ventilation) .41 Particular attention should be paid to the potential for transmission via exhaled air during supportive respiratory procedures.111 There is evidence both for166 and against195 the detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA via air sampling in patie nt rooms and other hospital areas . Research at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security has provided initial estimates of PPE needs in the US: 7.8 billion gloves, 668 million gowns, 360 million surgical masks, and 136 million N95 or similar respirators. 249 KN95 respirators are, under certain conditions, approved for use under FDA Emergency Use Authorization.98 Masks may be effective at slowing transmission . Surgical face masks, respirators and homemade face masks may prevent transmission of coronaviruses from infectious individuals (with or without symptoms) to other individuals .85, 151, 250 Surgical masks were associated with a significant reduction in the amount of seasonal coronavirus (not SARS -CoV-2) expressed as aerosol particles (<5 m) compared to not wearing a mask.151 Other preliminary work has failed to document protective efficacy of surgical or cotton masks,25 and more SARS- CoV-2 specific research is needed. On 4/3/2020, t he US CDC recommend ed wearing cloth face masks in public where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain .54 The efficacy of homemade PPE, made with T -shirts, bandanas, or similar materials, is less than standard PPE, bu t may offer some protection if no other options are available.70, 84, 217 What do we need to know? Most PPE recommendations have not been made on SARS -CoV-2 data, and comparative efficacy of different PPE for different tasks (e.g., intubation) is unknown.

Tests to be used for attribution. What do we know? All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. Genomic analysis places SARS -CoV-2 into the beta -coronavirus clade, with close relationship to bat coronaviruses. The SARS -CoV-2 virus is distinct fr om SARS -CoV-1 and MERS viruses.90 Genomic analysis suggest s that SARS -CoV-2 is a natural variant, and is unlikely to be human -derived or otherwise created by \"recombination\" with other circulating strains of coronavirus.17, 298 Genomic data support at least two plausible origins of SARS -CoV-2: \"(i) natural selection in a non - human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\"17 Both scenarios are consistent with the observed genetic changes found in all known SARS -CoV-2 isolates. Some SARS- CoV-2 genomic evidence indicates a close relationship with pangolin coronaviruses ,274 and data suggest that pangolins may be a natural host for beta -coronaviruses .162-163 Additional research is needed. A novel bat coronavirus (RmYN02) has been identified in China with an inserti on in the viral furin cleavage site. While distinct from the insertion in SARS -CoV-2, this evidence shows that such insertions can occur naturally.297 Additionally, \"[...] SARS -CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone,\" reducing the likelihood of laboratory origination,17 and \"[...] genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS- CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, [though] it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin.\"17 Work with other coronaviruses ha s indicated that heparan sulfate dependence can be an indicator of prior cell passag e, due to a mutation in the previous furin enzyme recognition motif.87 What do we need to know? Identifying the intermediate species between bats and humans would aid in reducing potential spillover from a natural source. Wide sampling of bats, other wild animals, and humans is needed to address the origin of SARS -CoV-2. What tests for attribution exist for coronavirus emergence?

What do we know? Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates substitutions and mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Mutations and deletions in specific portions of the SARS -CoV-2 genome have not been linked to any changes in transmission or disease severity, though modeling work is attempting to identify possible changes . There have been no documented cases of SARS -CoV-2 prior to December 2019 . Preliminary genomic analyses, however, suggest that the first human cases of SARS -CoV-2 emerged between 10/19/2019 - 12/17/2019.18, 31, 212 The mutation rate of SARS -CoV-2 is estimated to be similar to other RNA viruses (e.g., SARS, Ebola, Zika), and is currently calculated to be 1.04x10-3 substitutions per site per year ( n=116 genomes).117 Pangolin coronaviruses are closely related to both -CoV-2 and closely related b at coronaviruses . Phylogenetic analysis suggests that SARS -CoV-2 is of bat origin, but is closely related to pangolin coronavirus.162-163 The SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein , which mediates entry into host cells and is the major determinant of host range, is very similar to the SARS -CoV-1 Spike protein .169 The rest of the genome is more closely related to two separate bat169 and pangolin163 coronavirus es. An a nalysis of SARS -CoV-2 sequences from Singapore has identified a large nucleotide (382 bp) deletion in ORF -8.242 In Arizona, researchers identified an 81 -base pair deletion (removing 27 amino acids) in the ORF -7a protein, indicating that mutations can be detected by routine sentinel surveillance. The function of th ese deletion s are unknown at this time.120 A recent report of virus mutations within patients needs more research .135 Additional analysis of data suggests the results may be due to experimental methods.108, 284 Structural modeling sugg ests that observed changes in the genetic sequence of the SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein may enhance binding of the virus to human ACE2 receptors.196 More specifically, changes to two residues (Q493 and N501) are linked with improving the stability of the virus - receptor binding complex.196 Additionally, structural modeling identified several existing mutations that may enhance the stability of the receptor binding domain, potentially increasing binding efficacy. 197 Infectivity assays a re needed to validate the genotypic changes and possible phenotypic results identified in these studies. A key difference between SARS -CoV-2 and other beta -coronaviruses is the presence of a polybasic furin cleavage site in the Spike protein (insertion of a PRRA amino acid sequence between S1 and S2).80 What do we need to know? Research linking genetic changes to differences in phenotype (e.g., transmissibility, virulence, progression in patients) is needed. Are there similar genomic differences in the progression of coronavirus strains from bat to intermediate species to human? Are there different strains or clades of circulating virus?
