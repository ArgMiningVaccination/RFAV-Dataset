As a kid, I often visited the knitting mill that my dad ran. So I've inhaled the eye-burning chemicals it takes to make synthetic textiles directly. And yet, when I started researching what went into our everyday rugs and carpets, I couldn't believe it. The vast majority of rugs and carpets on the market today are made from synthetic materials that are laden with toxins. These are dyed with chemical colorants and backed with PVC and chemical adhesives, all of which off-gas into your home. To top it off, they are treated with highly toxic PFAS, formaldehyde, pesticides, and other chemicals to make them stain proof, moth repellent, fire retardant, and water repellent. Truly Natural & Non-Toxic Rugs What shocked me more than the chemicals were the so-called \"natural rug brands\" that seemed great at first... until I read the fine print to see they coated their natural fibers with harsh chemicals. That did not sit well with me, so I dug further to find non-toxic, eco-friendly rugs with ethical standards I could trust. Here's what I found. [Hook and Loom](https://greenopedia.com/recommends/hook-and-loom/): eco-friendly area rugs, upcycled & chemical-free Hook & Loom offers a beautiful selection of non-toxic rugs made from either wool or eco-cotton \u2014 all without chemicals, dyes, latex, or glues. Their wool rugs are undyed, using only the sheep's natural colors. And their eco-cotton rugs use a unique, chemical-free process to recycle old rugs into new ones. They also offer GOTS-certified rugs made from (virgin) organic cotton. Check out their \"loom hooked\" collection if you like a softer and springy feel. Otherwise, explore their \"flatweave\" collection for a firmer (but still soft) feel. Both styles are handwoven in a safe environment by workers who are paid a fair wage and treated with compassion.

Not only do they sell GOTS-certified rugs and carpets, but they are all certified free of child labor by [GoodWeave](https://goodweave.org/). Their wool is sourced from organically-farmed sheep (never dipped in chemicals), while their cotton is farmed organically without the use of insecticides and pesticides. Also, their silk is hand-twisted and woven the traditional way without the chemical baths or synthetic additives often used to soften silk textiles. [Shop Organic Weave](/recommends/organic-weave/) Natural Rug Care Remember, your non-toxic rugs are not chemically treated to be stain-proof, waterproof, or dust resistant. So be sure to vacuum them weekly and, for those that can be washed, do so regularly to minimize the dust, mites, and other contaminants that we tend to bring into the house on our shoes. Also, lightly dab up any spills, ideally as soon as they happen. Treat anything that lingers with club soda, white vinegar, or baking soda. Enzyme-based stain removers can also help. Just be sure to check the label for unwanted chemicals.
