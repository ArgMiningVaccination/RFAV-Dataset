Data from clinical trials and from countries with a lot of COVID-19 cases have shown the vaccines to be safe and effective for those who have had COVID-19 ie SARS-CoV-2 infection. This includes those who were asymptomatic. IMAC recommends that if someone has had COVID-19 infection, then they should start or continue their vaccination from 6 months after recovery; if they have had a positive test but were asymptomatic, then vaccination can start 6 months after the first positive test. NOTE: In all instances, if there are clinical reasons for vaccinating earlier, they can be vaccinated from 4 weeks post-infection. For all other vaccinations, including flu, vaccination can commence from when the person is no longer acutely unwell. "}
