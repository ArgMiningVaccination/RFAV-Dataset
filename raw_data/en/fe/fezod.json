The Healing Arts Center provides a supportive atmosphere that integrates the mind, body, and spirit, and promotes learning, challenge, and growth for students. Why Experience Matters: | | The Healing Arts Center has been training professional massage therapists since 1990. Our curriculum is broken up into five ten-week \"level sessions\" (our name for \"terms\" or semesters\"). Each Level Session builds on the ones before it. During this time, students learn not only about massage technique, but anatomy, physiology, energy work, ethics, business and more. In 2015, The Healing Arts Center started a Free Cancer Clinic for patients currently undergoing cancer treatment. Student therapists complete special training to learn how to safely treat various kinds of cancer patients. After a session, Cancer patients may experience better sleep, reduced pain, and less anxiety. In 2017, The Healing Arts Center launched a new series of advanced technique programs called Master Tracks. These Master Track programs include Breathwork training, enabling the practitioner to coach private or group breath sessions that can release stress, anxiety, and even trauma trapped deep in consciousness and often causing physical symptoms. The Healing Arts Center also offers an Energy Medicine Master Track: Pranic Healing\u00ae that teaches wellness professionals (not just massage therapists) how to practice all 5 levels of Pranic Healing\u00ae. Why Class Size Matters: | | Our student body fluctuates between 75 and 110 students at any one time. Class sizes range between 10 and 24 students per class. The school provides you the hands-on experience that will be useful in your career and practice of massage therapy. "}
