For the most part, physicians have treated the mind-over-disease idea as an offshoot of voodoo medicine. Until recently, that is. Within the past 20 years, doctors and scientists have begun studying the mind-body connection in earnest, and now they're pinning down the science behind the brain's ability to influence healing. While you can't tell your immune-system cells where to go, it's becoming increasingly clear that you can nudge them along. \"These aren't trivial effects,\" says Michael Irwin, M.D., director of the Cousins Center of Psychoneuroimmunology (that's 39 Scrabble points, not counting double word bonuses) at UCLA. He's testing what happens when people are taught to lighten up. \"The effects we see with these behavioral interventions are bigger than those found with a placebo.\" Here's proof: six scientific strategies you can use to think your way to better health. 1. Change Your Mind Stress is the number-one mental culprit in the delay of wound healing. Ohio State researchers studied 11 dental students, taking a chunk of flesh from the roofs of their mouths during summer vacation. Then, 3 days before the first exam of the next school term, they took a chunk from the opposite side of each student's mouth. On average, the wounds took 40 percent longer to heal during stressful exam time than during the carefree days of summer. \"You can become a victim of the environment or the mind,\" says William Malarkey, M.D., director of Ohio State's clinical research center and a member of the Center for Stress and Wound Healing, \"or you can proactively change the environment of your mind.\" What you can do: Take a deep breath. Hold it. Exhale slowly. Research has shown that relaxation techniques--such as controlled breathing with a focus on long, drawn-out exhalation--lower the effects of both stress and blood pressure. If you don't have the patience for relaxation methods or yoga training, try a Walkman-like device called Resperate, which guides you toward therapeutic breathing. It's available at [drugstore.com](http://www.drugstore.com/) for $300. (The yoga class sounds better and better, doesn't it?) 2. Visit Pluto The best way to let your mind boss your body around is to enter a trance state, says Jim Nicolai, M.D., a fellow in integrative medicine at the University of Arizona. Hypnosis is one technique you can use to hit that trance state, but you don't need a swaying gold watch to do the trick to yourself. \"Having a daydream is a good example,\" says Dr. Nicolai. \"You can sense that there are things going on outside of you, but you just don't care. You're focused.\" When Harvard researchers used an MRI to examine what happens to the brain during meditation, they found that the practice activated parts of the brain involved in attention. And your cosmic voyage can do more than just help your body repair itself. Dr. Nicolai says trancelike states are ideal for working on your free throws. Once your head is in the clouds, it's easier to tell your body what to do. Using techniques such as Dr. Benson's relaxation response cuts down on the level of stress hormones. Dr. Benson acknowledges that they play a role in revving men up to run or fight, but the hormones can be damaging when they leach into the rest of life. \"What good is getting excited if you're not going to run or fight?\" he asks. What you can do: If you're up for seeing a hypnotist, look for a health-care professional--such as a psychologist--who is licensed to perform hypnotherapy. (The American Society of Clinical Hypnosis directory is at [www.asch.net/certreferrals.asp](http://www.asch.net/certreferrals.asp).) A \"certified\" hypnotist doesn't necessarily have the medical background. If that's too Amazing Kreskin for you, just let your mind wander. Daydreaming isn't hard. Though Dr. Nicolai says that about 20 percent of us have trouble getting into a trance, he says it's a skill you can work on--starting with those breathing exercises. 3. Recruit a Platoon Friendships go a long way in helping a person on the mend. Decades of research suggest that support is a great way to improve coping skills in terminally ill patients, but new studies have shown that a good marriage actually juices the immune system even in those who aren't fighting for their lives. \"If we're isolated from those around us, we ourselves are at risk,\" says Dr. Irwin. \"We need to have good social bonds.\" Of course, the knife cuts both ways. Just as a strong bond with the buds or a happy marriage helps you bounce back more quickly, squabbling with your honey does a lot more than trigger depression and the urge to pour doubles of Johnnie Walker. For starters, it disrupts your immune system and your cardiovascular system, complicating more than just the healing of a broken heart. What you can do: When it comes to social support, both quality and quantity count. A Carnegie Mellon University study found that people with the most types of social bonds are the least susceptible to the common cold. (The researchers didn't mess around, either. After evaluating the social ties of 276 healthy people, the scientists shoved cold-virus samples up the patients' noses.) As for quality, it pays to fight fair with your wife--couples who show \"hostile behavior\" in their relationships, whether they're newlyweds or have been married for decades, have weaker immune systems than those in loving relationships who are good communicators. A healthy sex life gooses the mind's protective power over the body, too. Psychologists at Wilkes University in Pennsylvania recently discovered that sex improves your immune system by up to 30 percent by boosting levels of immunoglobulin A, your body's first defense against cold and flu germs. Get your flu shots, men! 4. Meet the Beast Ignoring big problems will screw up your immune system as quickly as ignoring a big MasterCard bill will screw up your credit. If there are problems in other parts of your life, pushing them to the back burner isn't likely to lower your stress level, and it's almost certain to depress the immune cells that keep you operating at peak power. A 2001 study by Ohio State researchers found that during periods of high stress, concentrations of immune cells were significantly higher in people who tackled their problems or emotions directly than in those who avoided them. Especially at high stress levels, so-called active coping sparked the immune system to keep up its guard. What you can do: When it comes to anxiety in your life, avoid whining, avoid hitting the bottle, and avoid avoidance. The active-coping mantra, which has been linked to lower rates of depression, requires changing or removing the source of stress and emphasizes long-term planning and patience. It worked for Lance Armstrong, whose desire to face his cancer head-on impressed doctors more than his will to live. \"It was a bring-it-on attitude,\" says his doctor, Lawrence Einhorn, M.D., of the Indiana University school of medicine. 5. Beat the Blues Those with a tendency toward depression or anxiety also tend to have immune systems that aren't operating at their peak. Scientific models mimicking depression in mice have found that depressed mice are more susceptible to a form of the herpes virus. And the data is clear that, in humans, depression and the nation's number-one killer--heart disease--go hand in hand. \"We know that if you're depressed, you're at risk for cardiovascular disease,\" says Dr. Irwin. \"You have a fivefold higher risk of having a heart attack.\" Depression treatments are well understood: See a therapist and talk to your doctor about antidepressant medications. The payoff can go well beyond emotional well-being. Return your mind to top form, and your body will follow. What you can do: Sweat the blues away. James Blumenthal, Ph.D., a professor of medical psychology at Duke University, assigned 156 people with major depression to one of three groups. Some took antidepressants, some were charged with exercising moderately for 45 minutes three times a week, and some did both. The results: Pills worked no better than pushups, and, 10 months later, those who exercised were least likely to have their depression return. Another study suggests that participating in sports like rock climbing or kayaking--anything that gets your adrenaline pumping--can have a significant impact on the body's ability to deal with stress. Texas A&M researchers found that fit men experience less psychological stress when doing challenging activities than do out-of-shape guys. And the better shape they were in, the better the men's bodies could react to mental stress. Rock on: To find the best places to climb in your area, go to [rockclimbing.com](http://www.rockclimbing.com/). For kayaking, check out [americanwhitewater.org](http://www.americanwhitewater.org/). If you're looking for something that combines a bunch of adrenaline boosters in one contest, go to the [Hi-Tec Adventure Racing Series](http://classic.mountainzone.com/adventure/99/hitec/). For an even more powerful mood lifter and immune booster, exercise your social skills along with your body. If you're new to an area and want to make friends, try beach volleyball. \"It's by far the most popular sport we offer,\" says Jason Erkes, president of the Chicago Sport and Social Club. And, better yet, according to Erkes, the skill level is low, \"so you don't have to worry about making a fool of yourself.\" Plus, you'll find lots of girls. In bikinis. If you live near a major city, go to [sportandsocialclubs.com](http://www.sportandsocialclubs.com/) to find a program or league near you. Or check out your neighborhood YMCA, parks-and-recreation department, college extension program, or health club. Or just tear up your front lawn, fill it with sand, set up a volleyball net, and see who shows up. And hope they show up in bikinis. 6. Page Dr. Carlin Voltaire, two centuries ago, said that medicine \"consists of amusing the patient while nature cures the disease.\" Now, science has proved it. In a 2001 study, a group from Loma Linda school of medicine took 52 men and showed them a goofy videotape for an hour, taking blood samples 10 minutes before, 30 minutes into, and 12 hours after the video. The number of natural killer cells (they kill germs, not people) in the subjects' blood increased during the video, and remained high 12 hours later. Though the men in the study were healthy, the researchers say that the immune boost seen in the patients helps explain the results of past studies, such as the group's 1997 finding that heart-attack patients who watched 30 minutes of funny shows daily had lower blood pressures, needed fewer drugs, and suffered fewer additional heart attacks than their peers hooked on the History Channel. What you can do: In the 1997 study, the Loma Linda heart patients saw results when they picked sitcoms. (Yes, all those Seinfeld reruns are doing you some good.) In the more recent study, the 52 healthy guys who had their blood drawn watched the tired watermelon-smashing shtick of the trapped-in-the-'70s comedian Gallagher. (Their fault--they chose the video.) But there was no difference in results. Research shows that humor--whether it's the laugh-out-loud kind or just a chuckle--reduces levels of stress hormones, regardless of whether it's tasteful and sophisticated or slapstick and stupid. So, come next cold and flu season, leave the echinacea with Dr. Phil and make an appointment with Drs. Moe, Larry, and Curly. Having her pose nude can be a thrill for both of you. Make it happen Asking the woman you're sleeping with to pose for sexy photos or a video is a matter of trust. \"The woman has to trust that the man won't exploit her images on the Internet or show them to all of his buddies,\" says Michael Castleman, author of Great Sex. Let her keep the tape or memory card (or Polaroids, if you're old school). And ease into it. Don't rush preproduction. Most women are not exhibitionists. \"This is going to be a personal and emotional stretch for her, so go slowly,\" says Castleman. \"If you see photos that turn you on, show them to her and ask, 'Would you ever consider modeling like that?' \" Start out by taking pictures of the parts of her body she likes. Consider wardrobe. Don't insist on the full monty right away. \"Some of the most beautiful photos are shots in which you're not showing everything,\" says photographer Scott Nibauer. (Think Marilyn under a sheet.) Put her in one of your button-down shirts, or in a knee-length slip. \"This allows her to choose what she's going to reveal and when she's going to reveal it,\" says Castleman. Plan a screen test. Test photos are easily attained--and deleted--with a digital camera. Or plug the video camera into the TV but don't insert a tape yet. \"Once she sees herself on-screen, she might get over the fears,\" says Maggie Berman, cowriter of How to Have a XXX Sex Life. Know the plot. Staging a video is less intimidating if you make it seem like a movie with characters. \"Encourage her to live out her fantasies on camera,\" Berman advises. If she's always wanted to wear a French maid costume, try it now. Ensure that there'll be a sequel. \"Be prepared that the fantasy you had in mind might not turn out as heavenly as you imagined,\" says Berman. Whatever the result, play up the positive. \"Find something you admire, and let her know.\" She'll be much more willing to try again Four ways to fuel a productive, fully engaged life The energy that pulses through us is physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual, says sports psychologist Jim Loehr. To perform at our peak, we need to tap all four types of fuel; otherwise our talent and skill will be diminished and the engine will sputter. 1. Physical Energy Its components include strength, endurance, flexibility, and resilience. 2. Emotional Resilience The ability to bounce back from disappointment, frustration, and loss. 3. Mental Endurance The ability to sustain focus and concentration over time. 4. Spiritual Strength Reflection of the commitment to one's deepest values, regardless of circumstance. \"By training in all dimensions, we can dramatically slow our decline physically and mentally,\" says Loehr, \"and we can actually deepen our emotional and spiritual capacity until the end of our lives.\" Your state of mind affects your performance. Channel your mental energy to get results We men don't think of ourselves as moody. Except maybe, \"Am I in the mood for an AFC game today, or NFC? Or both?\" But of course we have more moods than that. And those moods--such as being mad, frustrated, nervous, or even ecstatic--can alter more than your mind. They can affect your muscles. \"Emotions influence thoughts, which in turn can influence behavior and performance,\" says Dave Yukelson, Ph.D., coordinator of sports-psychology services at Pennsylvania State University Sports Medicine. What you're feeling can make you put less into your workout--or cause you to skip it altogether. But those same moods can be used to help your lifting session. How? Most strong emotions--anger, anxiety, frustration--cause your adrenal glands to release adrenaline and more than 30 other hormones into your system. \"This hormonal surge causes your heart to beat faster, relaxes your bronchial tubes to improve breathing, converts fat and protein into extra blood sugar, and even slows down your digestion to improve muscular energy,\" says Richard Marsella, Ph.D., author of Welcome to Stress Management. \"Whether you feel like exercising or not, your body is already getting a temporary boost that could enhance your workouts.\" No matter how you feel, you can make the most of your workout--and even use it to improve your mood. Research suggests that exercise releases neurochemicals that function as antidepressants, stress relievers, and energy stimulators. The key is to mix and match moods with methods, so you can choose the right workout for your muscles when something else is on your mind. When You're Angry A chewing-out by the boss may seem like the perfect reason to drive past the gym and stop at Beers o' the World. But you can use that anger to your advantage. \"Being mad can cause men to feel stronger than usual,\" says Mike Huff, C.S.C.S., coordinator of sports performance at the Michael W. Krzyzewski Human Performance Lab at Duke medical center. Pound the weights, not the beers. Go heavy. Being angry elicits the greatest fight-or-flight response from your body, so you can use that hormonal surge for more strength. \"If you're naturally in that zone from anger, you may be able to use the same adrenaline spike that's already occurring to push your muscles to new levels,\" Huff says. Instead of rotating through a lot of different exercises, pick two or three compound moves like bench presses, shoulder presses, deadlifts, or squats. Add extra sets of each one, increasing the weight with each set. Just be sure to maintain good form so you don't get hurt. Go hard. If your anger is lingering, going heavy could work against you. \"When it comes to reducing your feelings of frustration and anger, either aerobic or anaerobic exercise will do the job,\" says Keith Johnsgard, Ph.D., author of Conquering Depression and Anxiety through Exercise. Research has found that aggressiveness is reduced in prisons where exercise facilities are added, he says. But if you've been ticked off for too long, your body may be too exhausted to handle heavy lifting. Jeff Bell, C.S.C.S., a New York City exercise physiologist, suggests performing the same exercises you normally would, but trying to increase the intensity by doing supersets of two or three compound exercises, or by picking one body part and doing multiple sets of different exercises back-to-back. \"You'll fatigue your muscles faster and increase respiration and circulation,\" Bell says. \"So you'll have to use less weight as you go, making it less likely you'll injure yourself if you decide to push yourself as hard as possible.\" When You're Happy A bonus, a homecoming win, or the christening of your new box spring gives you the perfect excuse to raise your hands in victory--and then go to the gym. Feeling great about something \"gives most people a higher sense of self-efficacy than they usually feel,\" says Ted Butryn, Ph.D., an assistant professor of sports psychology and sociology at San Jose State University. It might be a good time to raise the bar even higher. Do everything on one leg. \"Being happy places you in a mindset of feeling better than average physically,\" says Butryn. \"That makes it the ideal time to experiment with advanced exercises that may be perfect for breaking you out of an exercise rut.\" So try all your upper-body dumbbell exercises standing on one leg, or perform exercises while sitting on a stability ball. It'll give your body a break from your usual moves, while helping you improve muscles you don't normally work. Try something different. \"Being stoked about something makes it a good day to add something new,\" as long as you're not distracted by whatever put you in that great mood, Huff says. \"It's a perfect time for a great core workout or an intense bout of cardio,\" he says. When You're Frustrated A dead-end job, your team's last-second loss, or the kids' inability to get lemonade from point A (pitcher) to point B (glass) can put your brain in a neural demolition derby. \"There's something in your life that you can't seem to accomplish because of outside factors or the limits of your own abilities,\" says Butryn. Taking that mood to the gym, where success is measured by numbers, can be disastrous, so try other tactics. Switch the order. Reversing the order in which you do your exercises may seem counterproductive, but it could give you a psychological boost. \"Starting your routine with isolation exercises--like dumbbell curls--that you usually do after your muscles are exhausted makes it easier to use more weight during those exercises,\" says Bell. \"This changeup can leave you feeling stronger than usual, giving you the psychological boost you may need to keep exercising that day.\" Pick your best move. Trying a new routine or shooting for a new total in a particular lift can add to your frustration. Instead, change your routine and pack it with exercises that you know are 100 percent failure-free. \"Most guys already know which exercises they're either the strongest in or able to do with the best form,\" says Huff. Pick four or five of these moves and package them together. \"This can keep your brain from telling you to quit too soon,\" Huff says. When You're Bummed Exercising releases a fair amount of endorphins that can pull you out of a funk, but depression and mental exhaustion are the hardest moods to overcome--in terms of getting to the gym in the first place. \"You feel less interested in everything, which can make blowing off exercise that much easier to do,\" says Huff. Schedule just 15 minutes. Mentally preparing yourself to do only 15 minutes can help you through long workouts. \"It takes at least that long for the endorphins to do their job,\" says Huff. \"After 15 minutes, you'll likely feel better and go ahead and do the full workout--but you'll have the freedom to go and stretch if you want.\" Don't rest. \"In one sense, more rest only gives your mind even more time to dwell on whatever's upsetting you,\" says Butryn. Instead, lighten the amount of weight you typically lift and switch to higher reps with less time between sets--30 seconds, maximum. \"Speeding up your weight workout will still give your muscles a workout, while creating enough of a distraction for your mind,\" Butryn says. When You're Nervous Men get nervous for all kinds of reasons--before a speech, a putt, or a pickup line. Depending on the situation, nervousness can come from positive or negative factors, so adjust your workouts accordingly. Use the treadmill. If you're trying to reduce anxiety, you may want to stay away from the weights. \"Research has shown that weight lifting can sometimes elevate anxiety levels for as long as 1 hour afterward,\" says Johnsgard, \"whereas aerobic exercise can lower anxiety levels way below their baseline.\" Another way it helps: clearing your mind. \"Not having to be too creative about your exercise will leave you more time to think through whatever's causing you that anxiety,\" says Marsella. Space out. If you don't want to hash out your problems, Butryn recommends trying some form of disassociation. \"Distance runners use this sports-psychology tactic to help them forget about pain,\" says Butryn, \"but it's equally helpful in getting exercisers to forget about whatever's making them anxious.\" You can achieve disassociation with a few simple mental tricks that force your mind to wander: doing long division in your head, for instance, or focusing on one thing near you and thinking about it for 1 minute (or more than 1 minute, if she happens to be wearing tight shorts). \"It doesn't matter what you use, as long as it gets your mind off the pain or discomfort of your body, or whatever happens to be troubling you,\" Butryn says. \"It can force your brain to think in a different way than it's "}
