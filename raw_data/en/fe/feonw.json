By Grace Segers Illustration by Madison KetchamMinority Report WHEN DEMOCRATS RECAPTURED the House in 2019 after eight years of Republican control, a crew of newly elected progres - sives\u2014a squad, if you will\u2014quickly garnered headlines for their willingness to challenge party leadership and their uncompromising idealism. During new member orientation in November 2018, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted a group photo of herself alongside fellow new members Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, a title deri - sively employed by detractors and inspiring to supporters. The ranks of vocal, social media-savvy young progressives soon expanded after the 2020 elections, in part due to success in unseating established incumbents, and the process repeated itself in the 2022 mid - terms. Four years after that selfie, AOC is now an elder millennial stateswoman of the group. \"The Squad\" is an amorphous term rather than an official designation, but membership has roughly doubled since its inception, now registering somewhere between eight to 10. But despite greater numbers, the new and old members came back to a changed reality in D.C. at the beginning of 2023. After four years in the majority, Democrats lost the House once again. For the Squad, which have only known their votes to matter, this NATION OF THE STATE 5 State of the Nation How concerned are you that House Republicans will cause a fiscal crisis? Felicia Wong President and CEO of the Roosevelt Institute It is almost inevitable that these House Republicans will use the debt ceiling limit to cause political crisis. For them, chaos is the point. But we have choic - es in response. We could abolish the debt limit altogether, since it serves no real purpose. We could close the $7 trillion \"tax gap\" so our government can collect the revenues wealthy Amer- icans currently owe but don't pay. And we could raise taxes on the ultrarich. All are good policy and good politics. Faiz Shakir Founder and Executive Director of More Perfect Union T ake care of our economy or preserve his own job\u2014that's the \"choice\" fac - ing Kevin McCarthy. One of those will likely need to be sacrificed. Sad state of the House GOP, for sure. Dean Baker Senior Economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research I am very concerned that the Re - publicans could succeed in tanking the economy and/or gutting core programs like Social Security and Medicare. The debt ceiling is their key opportunity. They can be stopped unless the Biden administration manages the crisis poorly, or the Re - publican Supreme Court intervenes to deliberately bring about chaos. Sharon Parrott President of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities Using the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip to try to force unpopular cuts in areas like health care, assistance for struggling families, and education is reckless. Even the threat of default jeopardizes our economy. If we default, people across the country would bear the impact: recession, millions of lost jobs, payments to seniors, veterans, businesses, and families unpaid. DEMOCRACY WATCHtransition to relative impotence may come with a sharp learning curve, but also op - portunity: to present a united front against Republicans, and coalesce more of the party under progressive ideals. \"I actually feel good about all of this,\" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told me in early January. \"I think there are certain aspects here where we can flex our muscles even more sometimes than un - der a Democratic majority.\" Ocasio-Cortez argued that being in the minority \"allows us to propose and work on legislation in ways that [are] just simply difficult when you're a governing majority and there are literally fires that you are putting out every single day.\" Republicans' small governing margin means that the 212 Democrats in the House will still have a say. Given the dissension within GOP ranks, it's likely that new House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will eventually need Democratic votes to pass government funding bills or raise the debt limit. But he's also started to use the new conservative majority to sideline certain Democrats, in - cluding Omar, whom\u2014as of the time this magazine went to print\u2014House Republicans were attempting to block from retaining her seat on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Still, Tlaib, a fellow inaugural member of the Squad, told me that her experience in the minority party in the Michigan leg- islature prepared her for the next two years in Congress. \"There's a lot of similarities,\" Tlaib said. \"I already feel it.\" She highlighted the possibility of finding common ground with Republicans on her committees, and the work she does on her bipartisan caucus aimed at removing lead from water supplies. However, Democrats' power will lie more in gumming up the works for the opposing party than actually legislating. \"It's easier to be unified in the minority,\" said Representative Ro Khanna, who en - tered Congress in 2017 in the minority and who, while not a Squad member, is another prominent progressive in the House. \"It's easier to be unified against an extreme Republican Party.\" REPRESENTATIVE PRAMILA JAYAPAL, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus\u2014a broader coalition of progres- sive members that all Squad members belong to, and where Omar was recently elected deputy chair\u2014told me in January that the caucus would meet for a training ses - sion to discuss the practices and procedures, because \"it's a really different experience being in the minority.\" The newest members, as well as those elected in 2018 and 2020, will need to know the tools at their disposal. \"It's different this time, because we have the Senate and we have the White House. So it's not like when I came in '17,\" Jayapal said, \"where it was just so painful the whole time because the things that we voted on actually ended up passing and being signed into law\" by President Donald Trump. It helps that the ranks of progressives are ever-expanding, not only within the Squad, but the Congres - sional Progressive Caucus as a whole. The caucus now boasts more than 100 members, including 16 new representatives, making it one of the largest ideological caucuses in the House. Democrats are quick to tell reporters now that they don't just stand against Repub - licans, they have an agenda for American advancement\u2014a \"proposition party\" rather than merely an \"opposition party,\" as Jayapal described it to me\u2014which is the mirror im - age of the argument Republicans made just a few months ago. But as the now-splintering GOP majority could attest, having an enemy is a powerful motivator. Moreover, many progressive ideas have been mainstreamed in recent years, a trend accelerated by the Trump presidency and the pandemic. After all, while the package never made it out of the Senate, the House did eventually pass the full Build Back Better Act, with its provisions like free com - munity college, paid family and medical leave, an expanded child tax credit, and affordable housing investments. Coalescing under those values may be easier in the minority, when there are lower stakes and a common enemy. It may be helpful for progressive morale to see the next two years through rose-colored lenses as a time for coalition building and preparing the groundwork for future action. \"I think this is a really great opportunity for us to deepen and build down\u2014down-ballot, grassroots organizing,\" Ocasio-Cortez told me, \"and also in drafting a lot of grass - roots-led legislation to then be reintroduced when we hopefully have the majority again in 2024.\" But for supporters of progressive causes, the situation is still far from ideal. \"The alternative would definitely be better,\" said Deirdre Shelly, the campaign director at the Sunrise Movement, a youth-oriented grassroots organization supportive of the Green New Deal, although she acknowledged \"it could be worse.\" \"It's always going to be an adjustment going into the minority,\" she told me, \"and 6 March 2023A brief look back at the chaos of Donald Trump's White House at this time five years ago. TRAGEDY On March 1, T rump's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service quietly reversed an Obama-era ban on the import of elephant-hunting trophies from Zim - babwe and Zambia. The NRA quickly praised the decision. It was \"a signif - icant step forward in having hunting receive the recognition it deserves as a tool of sound wildlife manage- ment,\" said the executive director of the group's lobbying arm. (Mean- while, Ryan Zinke, T rump's interior secretary, suggested that increased hunting somehow fostered conservation\u2014and even added an arcade game, Big Buck Hunter , to the employee cafeteria.) The trophy decision wasn't too surprising, given Don Jr.'s and Eric T rump's fondness for hunting big game, including ele - phants. (ProPublica reported that Don Jr. killed an endangered sheep while hunting in Mongolia.) FARCE In early March, T rump fired Secre - tary of State Rex Tillerson. It's not so amusing that Tillerson, who spent over a decade as CEO of ExxonMobil before joining the T rump adminis - tration, got canned. Except ... he was on the can when it happened. While sitting on the toilet, Tillerson got wind of T rump's plans during a phone call he had with the president's chief of staff. In usual petty fashion, T rump didn't bother to give the news to Tillerson directly; instead, the president made it official with a declaration on Twitter. FASCIST During a private event at Mar-a-Lago, T rump pined to have the same powers as an authoritarian ruler. Shortly after Chinese President Xi Jinping success - fully abolished term limits in 2018 and cemented his unquestioned rule of his country, T rump told an audience dur- ing a fundraiser, \"He's now president for life.... I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot someday.\" NEVER FORGET JABIN BOTSFORD/THE WASHINGTON POST/GETTYit's not what we wanted, but ... progressives have never really had more influence in the time that the climate movement has been involved with Congress.\" WHILE DEMOCRATS ARE in the minority, the focus for progressive groups may shift slightly away from who is already in Con - gress, to those who have yet to be elected. \"We're all in a period of time where we rec- ognize that the transformative legislative possibilities of the first couple of years of the [Biden] administration are off the table until we're back in a trifecta situation,\" said Leah Greenberg, the co-founder and co-ex - ecutive director of the progressive advocacy group Indivisible. \"This is a period of time in which progressives, like all Democrats, can be building towards, what are the ideas that will represent and define us as a party?\" Shelly said that the Sunrise Movement will look for progressive primary and gen - eral election candidates to support. Rahna Epting, the executive director of grassroots progressive organization MoveOn, highlight - ed the need to \"maximize any possible wins that we can that remain out of a Democratic presidency,\" and support Senate Democrats as they confirm President Joe Biden's judicial and administrative nominees. Congressional progressives have also urged Biden to take more executive action on those Democratic priorities that cannot be accomplished in a closely divided Congress. Pressley and Omar, for example, repeatedly urged Biden to cancel student loan debt. \"The wins are different,\" Epting said. There are also the fundamentals of what it means to be a member of Congress. When I spoke to him in December, Representa - tive Jamaal Bowman argued to me that the core of his job would remain the same: representing his constituents. \"Well, I've been a minority all my life,\" Bowman, who was elected in 2020, quipped. After telling me that I \"opened the door\" for that joke by asking what it would be like to transi - tion to life in the minority, he continued: \"The bottom line is, my constituents have needs, and I'm going to continue to fight for those needs. And that happens here [in Washington] from a legislative and collegial perspective, that happens outside of here with my advocacy and using my platform to continue to share what my constituents find important, and why those things are important to the country as well.\" But progressives have accounted for crit - ical votes for four years, I pressed. If they aren't part of a majority anymore, does that diminish their power completely? Do they still have the juice? \"I can't speak for [other progressives], but ain't nobody taking my juice away,\" Bowman replied with a laugh. \"I'm always having juice.\" Grace Segers is a staff writer at The New Republic.

State of the Nation Has Arizona actually turned purple, or just rejected Trump and maga ? By Marisa Agha Photograph by Steve CraftHobbsian Choice THE SUN WAS still rising on a Wednesday in early January as the crowd filtered into the ballroom of a hotel in downtown Mesa, Arizona, just outside Phoenix. About 350 people, a mix of business leaders, area city and school officials, and a handful of firefighters, had come to a buffet breakfast to hear from their newly inaugurated gov - ernor, Katie Hobbs. One of three Democrats who flipped a Republican governorship in the 2022 midterms, Hobbs was spending her second week in office touring Arizona for a series of State of the State addresses. During her remarks, she highlighted several of her priorities, which mainly focused on boilerplate bipartisan appeals rather than bold declarations of a liberal shift under new Democratic governance: investments in public education, addressing rising costs, and securing water. That measured tone wasn't too surpris - ing. Hobbs's win last November cemented that Arizona is now firmly a swing state. As the state's elections' chief, Hobbs rose to national prominence voicing her concern about threats to democracy. Now, as gov - ernor, she helms one of the most contested and coveted states for both parties after a particularly turbulent time in Arizona history\u2014a contentious recount battle waged by Donald Trump's supporters in the after- math of 2020, followed by the continued refusal of her opponent Kari Lake to concede months after the vote counts were settled. When she was sworn in at the beginning of this year, Hobbs became the state's first Democratic governor in 14 years. She's also one of 12 female governors in office this year, a milestone number. \"It's really sad, actually,\" Hobbs told me, \"that we're in 2023 and ... only a quarter of the governors are women, and that's a record.\" For decades, Arizona has been known as the land of Barry Goldwater, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and SB 1070, the state's controversial immigration law. The conservative roots run deep. While the past two elections have made it clear that the old Arizona ethos is changing, it's still not an easy place for a Democrat. Hobbs, a self-described optimist, has said that she wants to create \"an Arizona for everyone,\" but she's also a political realist who's risen relatively quickly. How will the new Democratic governor lead a state where the majority of constitu - ents are barely in the middle? After all, 35 percent of Arizona's registered voters are Re - publicans, and 34 percent are independents. 9781009257930 | Hardback | $24.95 Save 20% on cambridge.org/Unwired with the code UGB20. a compelling roadmap for tackling one of our most pressing problems: the irresistible pull of technology Adam Alter, author of Irresistible and Drunk Tank Pink 1931.indd 11931.indd 1 11/01/2023 14:0011/01/2023 14:00 March 2023 \"We had a choice in this election, and it wasn't about Democrats versus Republi - cans,\" Hobbs told me later that day. \"It was about sanity versus chaos. And I talked to so many people after the election who just said, 'I voted for sanity,' and that was like code for 'I voted for you.'\" Indeed, the election was striking, in that alongside Hobbs, Arizonans chose Democrats Adrian Fontes as secretary of state and Kris Mayes as attorney general, all in a state where fewer than a third of vot - ers identify as Democrats. \"I think we have a mandate from voters to put the partisan politics aside,\" Hobbs said, \"and deal with these tough issues we're facing.\" HOBBS, 53, GREW up in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. When Hobbs was in the fifth grade, she remembered, her teacher criticized \"government freeloaders.\" Hobbs's family sometimes relied on food stamps and unemployment benefits. \"I didn't really understand what she was talking about,\" Hobbs recalled. Her mother was up- set when Hobbs relayed the story to her. \"I realized that she was talking about fam - ilies like mine who needed that support to get by,\" Hobbs said. She partially credits the experience for leading to her eventual career as a social worker. \"Which really is why I'm here,\" Hobbs said when we talked in a conference room adjoining her office at the state Capitol. At what was then known as Seton Catholic High School in Chandler, Hobbs was on stu - dent council, the yearbook and newspaper staffs, and a member of the National Honor Society. \"I'm definitely a joiner,\" she told me. \"I was involved in everything.\" She earned degrees in social work, first a bachelor's from Northern Arizona University and then a master's from Arizona State University. Hobbs saw the breadth of humanity's woes as a social worker, which eventually led her to electoral politics. \"I just got very frustrat - ed by the difficulty of making vulnerable people's voices heard in the halls of power,\" she said, \"and making change that would help their lives.\" In 2010, she won a seat in the Arizona House of Representatives. Two years later, she moved up to the state Senate, and by 2015 she was already the body's minority leader. In 2018, just eight years after her first run for office, Hobbs was elected secretary of state. Normally, that's a sleepy backwater job, one that helps a politician move up the internal party ranks, but not one that registers on the radar of most voters. That quickly changed during the protracted election audit of the 2020 presidential race. She spoke out, calling the audit \"highly partisan\" and intended \"to continue to tout the Big Lie.\" State Sen - ator Lela Alston, a Democrat who served alongside Hobbs in the legislature, wasn't surprised when Hobbs stood up to election deniers, despite death threats. \"I've seen that backbone and the grit.\" \"I didn't ever even question will I do this or not,\" Hobbs told me in January, reflect - ing back. \"It was the right thing to do.... We needed someone to stand up and defend the will of the voters, and I think it's what I was elected to do.\" WHEN YOU ASK local political experts about the new governor, the words you most often hear are \"moderate,\" \"understated,\" and \"civil.\" In a tricky state, which until 2020 had not elected a Democrat for presi - dent since 1996, those qualities could prove useful. While there are some demographic changes driving Arizona's recent elections \u2014including emerging Latino voters and new transplants from blue states\u2014the apparent swing left is more about the state's Republi - can and independent voters' distaste for the rancor and extremism of the Donald Trump maga era, said Samara Klar, associate pro - fessor of political science at the University of Arizona in Tucson. \"We really don't see an electorate that appears to be shifting blue,\" Klar said. \"Democrats in Arizona who have been successful are centrist and moderate.\" During her campaign last year, Hobbs faced widespread criticism, including from some supporters, questioning why she refused to debate Lake, an election denier STATE OF THE NATION They're both questionably Long Island Jews (or at least, in Santos's case, \" Jew-ish\"), with a penchant for making up outlandish biographies\u2014men who lie without any qualms.

She calls Lake's actions since the election, including a long-shot lawsuit that was eventually tossed out of court, \"political theater.\" Unlike U.S. Senators Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema, as governor, Hobbs won't be accountable to colleagues during tough votes. Sinema, who ended 2022 by switch - ing her party identification from being a Democrat to an independent, has faced the wrath of other senators, her party, and Ari - zona Democrats for not always supporting the president's agenda. \"Hobbs is free from that,\" Klar said. \"She is the executive of her state. She has a lot more freedom to go to the middle as much as she wants.\" Hobbs's initial days in office mostly focused on issues without overt partisan associations: inflation, money for schools, and homelessness. Arizona's homeless pop - ulation has grown by 23 percent since 2020, among the highest increases in the nation, according to figures from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In her first week, Hobbs issued an executive order restoring an interagency council to address homelessness and housing. Additionally, she stressed boosting funding for public educa - tion, and she plans to launch a task force to improve teacher retention. \"Education gave me a chance to climb my way up and build a better life,\" she told Arizona lawmakers in her first State of the State speech on January 9. But when the speech turned to her support for reproductive rights, some GOP members in the audience revolted. A state appeals court in late December ruled that doctors cannot be prosecuted under a pre-statehood 1864 law banning nearly all abortions, but the Arizona Supreme Court could reverse that. Meanwhile, a law passed by Republi- cans last year banning the procedure after 15 weeks remains in effect. During her speech, Hobbs declared, \"My administration will always protect reproductive freedom for all Arizonans,\" which prompted a group of Republicans to walk out of the chamber. Hobbs faces a Republican legislature with a slim majority and told lawmakers during the opening session that she wants to \"work together.\" But she also said \"chasing conspira - cy theories\" or \"seeking to further undermine our democracy will lead nowhere.\" Her cabinet appointments include some holdovers from her predecessor, Republi - can Doug Ducey. And she named a lifelong Republican, M\u00f3nica Villalobos, to co-chair her transition team. Villalobos, president and CEO of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said she \"really had to dig deep,\" but Hobbs impressed her during a town hall. \"Her style is very much a servant to the people,\" Villalobos said. She was struck by Hobbs's collaborative message to the com - mittee: \"Bring me the best and the brightest. I don't care what party they're from.\" Hobbs was receptive to her business perspective; she \"allowed me into the inner sanctum of her group and to speak honestly,\" said Villalobos, who is still a Republican. \"That's brave.\" Marisa Agha is a journalist based on the West Coast. Three Women Who Shaped the Destiny of Freedom in America In 1943, three books appeared that transformed American politics and laid the groundwork for what became the modern libertarian movement: Isabel Paterson's The God of the Machine, Rose Wilder Lane's The Discovery of Freedom, and Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead. Sometimes friends, at other times bitterly estranged, these authors became known as \"the three furies of libertarianism.\" In this new book, author Timothy Sandefur examines their lives, ideas, and infl uences in the context of their times\u2014not a biography, but a dramatic story of three writers who strove to keep liberty alive in an age of darkness. AVAILABLE AT CATO.ORG AND ONLINE RETAILERS still disrupting politicsLyndon's Legacy By T ommy Craggs Illustration by Kelsey Dake IT DIDN'T GET a lot of attention, but back in November, a candidate representing one of the country's most successful home - grown fascist movements got a little over 25,000 votes in her bid for Chuck Schumer's Senate seat. This was Diane Sare, who, in a campaign video taken outside Federal Hall on Wall Street, named as her main quali - fication her \"32-year association with the greatest economist and statesman the United States has yet produced, the late Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.\" The way she delivered the line, positioned as she was beneath the bronze crotch of George Washington, speaking with the dead-eyed adamancy of someone well practiced in the arts of political irritation, it was a little as if she were daring you to laugh. And how could you not, just a little? A LaRouchie on the ballot! In the third de - cade of the twenty-first century! Yesterday's cranks, still doing their thing in the age of Q, their thing being, in part, to shriek in the mid - dle of town halls, hector people from their little stands in public parks, put Hitler mus - taches on photos of President Barack Obama, declaim against the queen of England for having been the most prolific drug dealer this side and probably that side of Pablo Escobar, and continue carrying the torch for the once-ubiquitous paranoid gadfly candi - date to end all gadfly candidates. LaRouchies still walk among us, embarrassing undead artifacts of another era's grotesque folly, like Henry Kissinger or the Bay City Rollers. God love 'em, you almost want to say. Sare brought home half a percent of the vote; she was routed by blank ballots. But winning elections was never really the point for the LaRouchies, even in their heyday, and elsewhere this fall, there were signs that LaRouchism was having a small moment. Here was Sare, swinging at softballs from the post-left YouTube screamer Jimmy Dore. There were her staffers and compatriots, heckling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and lam - basting Ilhan Omar, among others, over their votes to send military aid to Ukraine. Allowing themselves to be styled in the press as disillusioned anti-war leftists, they rope- a-doped AOC and Omar into denouncing them as Russian stooges. For a moment, the Squad members were left looking like evasive, hippie-punching warmongers by a group that made its bones in the 1970s attacking leftists with nunchucks (not kidding\u2014literal nunchucks). Four years ago, the Grand Poo-Bah went to that great airport table in the sky. LaRouche was invariably described in obits as a cultist and an eccentric\u2014indeed, he was a wackadoo perennial presidential can - didate who kept saying weird stuff about the Rockefellers. But from the vantage of the present, LaRouche doesn't seem so out of step with the country's politics. And the diminishment of his group over the past couple of decades\u2014in the 1980s, LaRouchies raised hundreds of millions of dollars and even won a couple of primaries, all while maintaining a massive private intelligence operation and insinuating themselves in the Reagan administra - tion by promoting the Gipper's Star Wars program\u2014doesn't look like marginalization anymore so much as reabsorption. Reading the past few years of Ameri - can politics backward into the history of LaRouchism, the movement comes off more and more like a baroque and churlish expres - sion of a tendency that's general across our politics, right and left, fringe and normie alike. Laugh at Diane Sare if you wish, but how freakish is a LaRouchie, really, in 2023? LAROUCHE WAS BORN into his conspir - acism. His parents were orthodox Quakers in New England, but these were not the serenely tolerant Quakers of popular image. In his definitive Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism , Dennis King reports that the couple \"were ferocious sectarians who accused their co-religionists of closet Bolshevism and embezzlement of religious funds.\" In a way, it was the organizing conceit of his life: the war on the enemy within. A self-described \"hardened Trotskyist,\" he was a member from 1948 to 1963 of the Socialist Workers Party, a group that was red-baited and factionalized into oblivion, after which he stayed hardened but let the Trotskyism slide. In 1968, he led a group within Students for a Democratic Society that broke with the larger organization over the pivotal Ocean Hill-Brownsville teachers' strike in New York City. The strike pitted Black and Puerto Rican parents pushing for community control against white educators. LaRouche's group took the teachers' side\u2014a sort of paleo-anti-wokeness that feels a little less paleo when you see strike signs like stop teaching race hatred to children . Drummed out of SDS, the faction rechris - tened itself the National Caucus of Labor Committees. Things got fashy in short order. In 1973-74, the nclc launched Operation Mop Up, a campaign of ferocious assaults on rival leftists, particularly members of the Commu - nist Party USA, while internally the group was increasingly run like a cult, with LaRouche using abusive \"ego-stripping\" sessions to firm up his followers' ideological commitments. Partnerships of convenience were struck with right-wing groups; racism and antisemitism flowered, for reasons both ideological and instrumental. \"He is a racist, unconsciously to be true,\" wrote no less an authority than Robert Miles, a Ku Klux Klan leader, exulting in his newsletter after a couple of LaRouchies won Democratic primaries in Illinois in 1986. \"His glorification of European culture, morals and histories is instinctive.\" Analysis of the LaRouche movement, when it's taken seriously, tends to focus on the drift from left to right, from the Marxist- Leninism of his New Left days in the 1960s to reactionary conspiratorial populism from the 1970s. But as the writer Donald Parkinson has observed in the online LaRouchies still walk among us, embarrassing undead artifacts of another era's grotesque folly, like Henry Kissinger or the Bay City Rollers.11 State of the Nation magazine Cosmonaut\u2014as always, it's the communists who see LaRouche most clearly, at least when they're not getting their heads cracked open\u2014there were continuities that spanned LaRouche's different eras. There was the egomania, which manifested in a One True System mode of thinking, and an economism so stubborn and one-eyed it could only conceive of the Holocaust as a policy of labor exploitation. But above all, there was LaRouche's belief in an essentialized, even biologized, unassim - ilable Other. This Other stalks the thickets of his prose in the form of \"the Aristotelians,\" \"the Rothschilds,\" \"the witches,\" \"the oli - garchs,\" it would come to sit comfortably alongside his producerist view of finance capital as a parasite thrusting itself on to the \"real\" economy\u2014a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, to borrow Matt Taibbi's famous metaphor for Goldman Sachs. (Think the hysteria about \"woke capital\" is anything new? Check out LaRouche's argument about the credit sys - tem smoothing its expansion into the global south via \"bourgeois-democratic revolu - tion.\") Whatever leftist airs it might have once assumed, LaRouche's was a fascist logic for what could only become a fascist politics. Bear in mind that LaRouche was recruit - ing at a time of rapid deindustrialization and financialization across the United States; worker power was being crushed. Conspir- acy provided the language for his narrative about the dastardly enervation of the prole - tariat, just as QAnon's lurid phantasmagoria offered a grammar by which people could understand what they saw as threats to the family and gender order. To dismiss LaRouchism or Q as pure irra- tionality is to ignore the political stories they were telling, the way they enlisted people in counterrevolutionary projects. King makes the persuasive case that all that business about the queen was antisemitic code\u2014in LaRouche's view, Jewish high finance had so thoroughly subsumed the British Empire that the two were basically synonymous. Whenever he called Queen Elizabeth a drug pusher, everyone would have a laugh, but he was really talking about getting rid of the Jews. In 1988, LaRouche was convicted of mail fraud and tax evasion. His incarceration marked the beginning of his group's decline. Into the new century, it did retain its ability to annoy, staging racist demonstrations after the election of the first Black president and rallying support for the white nationalist who succeeded him. Last year, a schism opened up between the Lyndon LaRouche PAC and the LaRouche Organization\u2014run by his widow\u2014in part because the former had been too favorable to Donald Trump. \"Narcissism of small differences\" and all that, but you could maybe understand the LaRouche Organization's wish to carve out a distinction. Trump and LaRouche may have shared a makers-and-takers conspir- acism with roots going back to the country's founding, but it was LaRouche who put Jefferson in a brownshirt, LaRouche who first articulated a Euro-style fascism in a cosmopolitan American idiom\u2014fascism without the umlauts or the hoods. Sare was not the only LaRouchie on the ballot last cycle, incidentally. In New Mexico, Solomon Pe\u00f1a ran for the state House as a Republican. He lost, and later it emerged that he'd given more than $5,000 to LaRouche PAC since 2021. In denial about his defeat, Pe\u00f1a was arrested in January after he allegedly paid four men to shoot at the homes of Democratic leaders around Albuquerque. Nobody was hurt, but the shootings had their intended effect: fear. The 10-year-old daughter of a state senator was awakened by what she thought was a spider on her face. It turned out to be dry - wall dust from the holes opened up by the bullets. No one seemed to be laughing. Tommy Craggs writes for HBO's Game Theory With Bomani Jones. STATE OF THE NATION107,654,229 VOTES WERE CAST IN 2022 HOUSE RACES. IF ONL Y 6,675 PEOPLE HAD VOTED DIFFER ENTL Y, DEMOCRATS WOULD H AVE WON THE HOUSE. WHAT WENT WRONG? By Walter ShapiroAt first glance, Democratic performance in last year's House races was great. But a close look under the hood reveals that, with a few smarter moves and a little more luck, we'd have Speaker Jeffries, no reckless investigations, and two more years of legislative progress. Here's what happened. 107,654,229 VOTES WERE CAST IN 2022 HOUSE RACES. IF ONL Y 6,675 PEOPLE HAD VOTED DIFFER ENTL Y, DEMOCRATS WOULD H AVE WON THE HOUSE. 15 Features March 2023 14Even now, the glories of Election Night 2022 shimmer in memory as smug predictions of a first-term curse afflicting Joe Biden and the Democrats took it on the chin. The Senate was saved with every Democratic incumbent reelected, and John Fetterman victorious in the Land of Oz. Election deniers and insurrectionists were routed from Phoenix to Philadelphia. Even with the House, the Democrats could rightfully snicker as the widely anticipated Republican red wave crested during pundit roundtables on cable TV in October and by Election Day netted the GOP a paltry nine seats. But as fragile as Kevin McCarthy's major - ity may be, and as craven the compromises he had to make to become a pip-squeak speaker are, it is still a majority. And the closer you look at the election returns in the House, the more tragic that outcome becomes for the Democrats. It didn't have to be this way. ALTHOUGH ALMOST NO ONE realized it at the time, the 2022 elections for the House were the Capitol Hill version of George W. Bush versus Al Gore. Even by the stan - dards of close elections, 2022 was off the charts. An analysis by Jacob Rubashkin in early December for the political tip sheet Inside Elections found that just 6,670 votes spread over five House districts would have kept the Democrats in the majority. (Final counts have changed that number to 6,675.) For math mavens, that works out to be 0.006 percent of the more than 107 million votes cast in House races. According to Rubashkin's tally, 22,378 of these votes in the right places would have prevented the Republicans from picking up a single seat in the House. So we are not talking about a normal election\u2014this was the Democrats losing on a wild pitch in the tenth inning of the seventh game of the World Series. Many discussions of the narrow defeat of the Democrats pivot around redistricting. Had the courts thrown out Ron DeSan - tis's GOP gerrymander in Florida and kept the lopsided pro-Democratic mapping in New York, the Republicans would not cur- rently control the House. But even after the final 2022 district lines were set in stone, the Democrats still had a path to a 218-seat House majority. Overly fixating on redistricting obscures how agonizingly close the House Democrats came anyway and discourages examination of what the Democrats in key districts might have done differently in the quest for victory. \"The idiosyncrasies of this election are so in - tense,\" Rubashkin said, \"we are going to be talking about them for some time to come.\" Perhaps the weirdest aspect of 2022 was the way that partisanship played out. For more than a decade, it has been an article of faith in politics and journalism that elections have been nationalized with local factors minimized. That helps explain why last fall so many political handicap - pers mistakenly extrapolated from such national numbers as Joe Biden's dismal approval ratings to overconfidently forecast a coming Republican revolution. But in 2022, House elections didn't march in partisan lockstep across the nation. Depending on the state, districts moved sharply either toward or away from the Democrats. Brad Komar, a top strate - gist for the House Majority PAC (a leading Democratic independent expenditures group affiliated with the party's House leadership), pointed out, \"This was not a parliamentary election, where you win ev - ery seat that was 8-plus points for Biden in 2020 and lose every seat that was 4-minus for Biden. It was completely seat-by-seat.\" It was almost as if Biden's numbers and national polling didn't matter. What seem - ingly counted far more\u2014and this may be a hangover from the importance of statewide reactions to the pandemic\u2014was the pop - ularity of individual governors and other local factors. Gretchen Whitmer helped fuel a Democratic landslide in Michigan, while Kathy Hochul's underperformance in New York may have cost her party four House seats. Komar, who is one of the Democratic Party's leading experts on House races, added, \"You can't stress enough what a total break this election was from the Trump era and the statewide 2021 results in New Jersey and Virginia.\" Democrats may have been barely damp - ened by the red wave. But still, they should be haunted by the if-onlys. With 6,675 more votes, Hakeem Jeffries rather than Kevin the Spineless would be House speaker. The always jacketless Jim Jordan would not be chairing the House Judiciary Committee as he prepares to go Full Metal Jacket in foam- ing over and fomenting trumped-up Biden scandals. Marjorie Taylor Greene would still be ostracized rather than becoming (yikes) a Republican power player. With 6,675 more votes, the January 6 committee would still likely be issuing subpoenas, and the risk of the nation defaulting on its debt because of GOP temper tantrums and fiscal illiteracy would be minimized. On top of all that, the Democrats' added fifty-first seat in the Senate (John Fetterman) diminishes the sometimes-say-no power of Joe Man - chin and Kyrsten Sinema. As a result, the Democrats with a House majority could have kept the conveyor belt of meaning - ful legislation running to the president's desk. Had the Democrats gotten a few more breaks and made a few more smart moves, the House of Representatives would be a functioning legislative body today rather than an international embarrassment. There is no single reason why the Dem - ocrats failed to retain their House majority. Ideally, Democrats in key races should have raised more money, and the national party groups should have made letter-perfect targeting decisions. But no one in poli - tics is omniscient, despite the tenor of TV talk shows. In fact, speculation about alternative realities can only carry you so far. \"These elections aren't science experi - ments where you can run them over again with different factors,\" said Kyle Kondik, OPENING SPREAD: GETTY (X2)15 Features March 2023 14who analyzes House races for Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia. But it is instructive for 2024 and beyond to understand why the Democrats so nar - rowly missed in so many races. Beyond money, the explanations include ill-advised strategic decisions, cookie-cutter attack ad campaigns, overly pessimistic polling, and a failure to seize opportunities. Here are tales of eight congressional districts (from the New York City exurbs to Cali - fornia's Central Valley) where the House was lost. Had the Democrats won just five of these races\u2014all decided by fewer than 6,000 votes\u2014Joe Biden could effectively govern for the final two years of his first term. So, look at these stories as a political tragedy in eight acts. COLORADO-3: The Impossible Dream Democratic dreams of defeating pistol-packing Lauren Boebert on the state's rural Western Slope seemingly died with re - districting. On paper, the new map made the district unwinnable in 2022, since Don - ald Trump had carried it by 8 percentage points in 2020. The Cook Political Report rated the district \"Solid Republican.\" Democrat Adam Frisch, a former As - pen city councilman, tried to run a stealth campaign against Boebert, calling himself a \"conservative businessman\" and attacking the incumbent for offering nothing more than \"angertainment.\" Boebert responded in scattershot fashion with ads that attacked \"Pelosi's lying liberals\" and claimed that her rival's \"politics may work for Aspen ... but Adam Frisch is bad news for rural Colorado.\" In addition to the new district lines fa- voring Boebert, money was a determining factor here: Boebert ($7.1 million) badly outspent Frisch ($3.9 million), according to data from Open Secrets. And the money differential was driven by what was in many ways the real deciding factor in this one\u2014 the sense among Democrats that this just wasn't going to be a competitive race. \"So many people bought into the myth that the first election under a Democratic president would be a disaster that it was hard to raise money,\" said Colorado-based Democratic consultant Jennie Peek-Dunstone. \"Ad- am's biggest Achilles' heel was that nobody thought that the race was winnable.\" Even an early October public poll showing Frisch within 2 percentage points failed to dent the skepticism about a Democrat's chances in a Trump +8 district. It is difficult to fault the national Dem - ocratic groups, which had to prioritize winnable races, for not spending any mon - ey to defeat Boebert. \"Had the Democrats put more money in behind Frisch, it would have forced Boebert to spend more money,\" said Rick Ridder, a Denver-based strategist who advised a small independent expendi - tures effort supporting Frisch. \"He snuck up on her.\" Aggressive national spending might even have had a paradoxical effect: It might have hardened the partisan lines in the race and made it tougher for non- maga Colorado Republicans to vote for a Demo - crat for Congress. The context here is that, in recent years, Democratic donors have squandered hun - dreds of millions of dollars on impossible races. Amy McGrath raised a staggering $94 million to lose a 2020 Kentucky Sen - ate race to Mitch McConnell by nearly 20 percentage points. This time around, House candidate Marcus Flowers hauled in $16.3 million ($13.3 million of which was in small contributions), mounting a symbolic challenge to the maga -mad Mar- jorie Taylor Greene in Georgia, which he lost by nearly two-to-one. It is agonizing to imagine what Frisch could have done with a fraction of the money wasted on the unwinnable Greene race in Georgia. A few more Frisch positive ads\u2014reminding voters on the Western Slope that they had an alternative to someone whose politics are deranged\u2014would have saved the nation (and, yes, the House Democrats) from having to endure four days of Boe - bert's self-indulgent antics during the speaker fight. Losing Margin: 546 votes. CALIFORNIA-13: When Washington Consultants Pull the Strings This agricultural Central Valley open-seat race (which Demo - cratic incumbent Josh Harder abandoned to run in an adja - cent district) was the mirror opposite of Colorado-3. A district that Biden carried by 11 points was, despite the presidential margin, nationally recognized as a key toss-up race. But while this far-from- wealthy district may have looked exciting to national political handicappers, there was little local money available to either party. As a result, candidate spending by Democrat Adam Gray, a member of the state assembly, and Republican John Du - arte, whose family owns one of the largest agricultural crop nurseries in the coun - try, was dwarfed by the investments by national party groups. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the House Majority PAC spent $6.5 million on behalf of Gray, while the Congressional Leadership Fund, associated with Kevin McCarthy, countered with $7.1 million on the Republican side. All in all, candidate spending accounted for about one-quarter of the money spent in this majority Latino, blue-collar district that The Cook Political Report rated as D+4. The result was that neither candidate was in charge of his own campaign\u2014almost everything was shaped by consultants in Washington. That reality underscored a truism of modern campaigns: The more national groups in both parties dominate TV advertising in a House race, the more re - lentlessly vicious the tone of the 30-second spots. So voters in the district were treated to a barrage of attack ads that began, \"Val- ley workers already know that they can't trust bad boss John Duarte,\" or sneered, \"Politician Adam Gray. You pay his sal - ary, but he skips work.\" The predictable fruits of this relentless negativism were undermotivated voters on both sides, with California-13 registering some of the low- est turnout in the country for a toss-up race. \"This is a pox-on-both-your-houses district,\" explained a Washington-based Democratic strategist. \"And the Democrats suffered because they were the party in power in Washington and Sacramento.\" The Democrats also suffered because Gavin Newsom's easy gubernatorial re - election victory radiated all the excitement of watching almonds ripen. In fact, the biggest motivator for Democrats in Cali - fornia was Proposition One, which passed in a two-to-one landslide, enshrining the right to abortion in the state constitution. But the abortion issue did little for Gray in culturally conservative California-13, since Proposition One carried Merced Coun - ty, which comprises the largest number of voters in the district, by only a 53-to- 47-percent margin.

With a few more resources, a rising tide would have lifted all boats, including the under - funded Carl Marlinga. Losing Margin: 1,600 votes. NEW YORK-17: Maloney + Murdoch = Misery When it came to House races in New York in 2022, the Dem - ocrats were as incompetent as Prince Harry and Meghan's family therapist. Not only did Democratic- appointed state judges throw out a greedily gerrymandered Democratic redistricting plan, but the courts also ruled so late that the House primaries in the new districts had to be moved from June until August. Then moderate Sean Maloney\u2014a five-term House member who was supposed to be protecting the Democratic majority as the head of the dccc\u2014sized up the new map and jumped to a newly carved Hudson Valley district (the 17th), helping set off a self-destructive game of musical chairs as other incumbents collided in their quest for seemingly safe seats. Maloney's self- interested decision, for example, forced first-term incumbent Mondaire Jones, who grew up in federally subsidized housing in the district, to run and lose in a House primary in a new district that combined Lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn. When the dust settled, the Democrats lost four seats in the Empire State, almost single-handedly depriving Hakeem Jef - fries of a House majority with the returns from his home state. With beleaguered Governor Kathy Hochul, who inherited who had run well in two losing statewide Senate races in 2018 and 2020. Carl Marlinga, the Democratic nominee, was a 75-year-old, former longtime Macomb County prose - cutor who freely admitted, with a wistful kind of old-fashioned innocence, \"I always wanted to serve in Congress.\" On paper, it wasn't a fair fight, espe - cially since Marlinga raised only a paltry $1 million, less than one-fifth of what James spent on the campaign. While major Dem - ocratic groups stayed out of the race, the GOP-connected Congressional Leadership Fund spent $1.4 million viciously attacking Marlinga over his clients as an attorney in private practice: \"Carl Marlinga made his living representing sexual predators.\" All these calculations, however, failed to factor in the potency of the abortion issue in Michigan. Like California, Michigan approved an abortion rights amendment to the state constitution last November. Unlike California, Michigan was a state where abortion could realistically have been in jeopardy. \"Marlinga made all the right comments on abortion without the re- sources to get them out any further,\" said Michigan-based Democratic strategist Amy Chapman. \"If you asked voters who was the pro-choice candidate, I'm not sure that many voters knew.\" Michigan-10 can fall under the rubric of a polling failure. No one expected Gretchen Whitmer to win reelection by a double-digit margin, including the governor's own cam - paign officials, who had the race much tighter. National Democratic groups were certainly willing to play on the Michigan battlefield, since they invested $9 million to prop up incumbent Representative Elis - sa Slotkin, who won by 20,000 votes in a Lansing-area district. But better polling might have alerted the national party and major donors to the extent of the coming a Democratic-leaning California political data analysis firm, stressed, \"Josh Harder could have won here.\" But that wasn't where he ran\u2014and the Democrats may be down one seat in Congress because of it. Losing Margin: 564 votes. MICHIGAN-10: A Polling Failure The Democrats may have lost this seat within two hours of a statewide redistricting plan being approved at the end of 2021. Two-term Representative Andy Levin took one look at the map of the new 10th District (which Trump had carried by 1 point in 2020) and decided the safer course was to challenge fellow Democratic incumbent Haley Stevens in a primary in an adjoining district. Levin was wrong: He lost a bruising primary by 20 points. \"Andy Levin's ego and his nerve got in the way,\" said Susan Demas, the editor of the Michigan Advance, a nonprofit news site that covers state politics. \"Given the Democratic trend line in Michigan, it is difficult for me to conceive of a way that Levin wouldn't be in Congress right now if he hadn't changed districts.\" Most of the 10th District is in Macomb County, just north of Detroit, famous as the home of Reagan Democrats, blue-collar union workers who moved sharply to the right in the 1980s. In the twenty-first cen- tury, Macomb County has been a weather vane, going for Barack Obama twice and then switching to Trump in 2016 and 2020. This time around, the Republicans got the Trump-endorsed candidate they consid - ered their ideal recruit in the person of 41-year-old Black businessman John James, JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP/GETTY; TOM WILLIAMS/CQ-ROLL CALL/GETTY17 Features March 2023 16In 2022, House elections didn't march in partisan lockstep across the nation. Depending on the state, districts moved sharply either toward or away from the Democrats. It was almost as if Biden's numbers and national polling didn't matter. What seemingly counted far more was the popularity of individual governors and other local factors. Jeff Link, \"you assume that Iowa is a lost cause just like North Dakota and Idaho.\" Axne's narrow defeat last November can be argued both ways\u2014either as the death knell of Democrats in Iowa or as the result of strategic missteps. Democrats in Iowa normally boast a strong ground game, with lists for door-knocking honed from years of pres - idential caucuses and practiced methods of harvesting the early vote. But with incum - bent GOP Governor Kim Reynolds cruising to a landslide reelection, the Democrats' statewide effort consisted of little more than campaign posters. The Republican state legislature also tilted the playing field by eliminating nine days of early voting (which traditionally favored the Demo - crats) and requiring all absentee ballots to arrive by Election Day. The result: Com - pared to a similar off-year election in 2018, 33,000 fewer early votes were recorded in Polk County (Des Moines), where Axne got the bulk of her support. Iowa-3 was a district where money didn't dictate the outcome. The combination of a well-funded Axne campaign ($7.1 mil - lion) and comparatively inexpensive Des Moines TV time meant that the Democrats could mobilize a wide array of messages against the GOP nominee, state Senator Zach Nunn. Kyle Kondik, who followed the race for Sabato's Crystal Ball, noted that one issue dominated Axne's strategy: \"Nunn was pounded on abortion.\" At a debate during the GOP primary, Nunn had raised his hand to signify that he opposed abortion in all cases, with no exceptions for rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother. After the primary, Nunn tried to modify his stance, even writing an op-ed in The Des Moines Register that incorrectly claimed that Axne had \"taken out of con - text comments from a primary debate.\" Congressional Leadership Fund, which put $7.5 million into the race, began, \"Violent crime terrorizing New York ...,\" and then segued into a 2018 clip of the Democratic incumbent opposing cash bail. The irony is that Maloney deflected a divisive 2022 primary challenge from left-wing state Senator Alessandra Biaggi with the help of nearly $500,000 from a super PAC affiliated with New York City's police union. Losing a House district that Biden car - ried by a 10-point margin required what a Democrat consultant called \"a perfect storm,\" as Maloney became the first active leader of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to forfeit his seat in more than four decades. Losing Margin: 1,820 votes. IOWA-3: Abortion and Older Voters Until recently, Iowa was a swing state that went for Obama in both presidential elections and could elect Democrats in half or more of its congressional districts. But thanks to an aging, largely white popu - lation with fewer college graduates than the national norm, Iowa became a solidly Trump state in 2016 and has tacked right ever since. After the 2020 election, in which Trump carried Iowa by 8 points, Cindy Axne, representing a Des Moines-centered district, was the only Democrat left in the state's congressional delegation. For many national Democrats, fixated on fast-emerg - ing states such as Arizona and Georgia, Iowa has withered like a corn husk in winter. \"If you live in Washington,\" said Des Moines-based Democratic consultant the job when Andrew Cuomo was forced to resign, at the top of the ticket, Election Day was such a debacle that Republican George Santos\u2014the \"Jew-ish\" fabulist from Long Island\u2014won his House seat by 20,000 votes in a district that Biden had carried by 8 percentage points. And we haven't even gotten to the real reason why Maloney lost his new district. At the end of 2022, as New York City re - ported a yearly 13 percent drop in murders and a 17 percent decrease in shootings, the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid New York Post buried the encouraging story about the crime rate in half a column on page nine of its print edition. Virtually every other day of the year, especially during the lead-up to the 2022 elections, the Post apocalyptically portrayed New York City as a crime-filled hellscape where residents had a 50-50 chance of surviving each time they crowded onto the subway or grabbed a bagel from a corner cart. The Post is more than just Murdoch's plaything; it is also the newspaper that still shapes local TV coverage in the vast New York City media market and elsewhere in the state. \"The issue for all Democrats statewide surrounded crime and the ongoing conver - sation about crime,\" said Jef Pollock, who was Maloney's pollster. \"That's what made New York different from other states. New York state had lowered cash bail\u2014and then had a two-year conversation about that.\" When I suggested in an interview that Ma - loney's defeat might also be due to other factors, such as a lack of urgency about the abortion issue in a historically liberal state, Pollock snapped, \"I think folks are looking for things that aren't there.\" The Republican soft-on-crime assault, a GOP staple since the days of Richard Nixon, had all the subtlety of a mugging. A typi - cal anti-Maloney TV ad, sponsored by the BILL CLARK/CQ-ROLL CALL/GETTY19 Features March 2023 18consultant who mostly works for Repub - licans. \"Schweikert was capable of losing to the right candidate.\" Losing Margin: 3,195 votes. NEW YORK-22: Losing a Biden +8 District The most devastating negative ad in this race in an upstate district, which stretches from Syracuse to Utica, targeted the Trump Republican running for the open seat. \"Brandon Williams is an out-of-touch phony,\" the 30-second spot bluntly be - gan, before pointing out, \"Now Williams is running for Congress bankrolled by out- of-state money, living outside the district on his truffle farm.\" Needless to say, the words \"truffle farm\" were delivered with a sneer. The most devastating attack line in a debate was levied against Democrat Francis Conole, an Iraq War veteran and former naval intelligence officer from Syracuse. An opponent pointed out that Conole was benefiting from around $500,000 in campaign help from a super PAC largely financed by a cryptocurrency billionaire with the soon-to-be-famous name of Sam Bankman-Fried. Both of these moments came during the run-up to the August 23 party primaries, which were scheduled nearly two months later than usual because of the redistricting chaos in the state. Williams drew the fire of the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC affiliated with Kevin McCarthy, because he was judged too much of an un - abashed right-winger to win in this district. Conole, who had the backing of the national Schweikert was fined $50,000 for campaign finance violations in 2020 and racked up another $125,000 in penalties in 2022. Also, there were more 2022 campaign ads (mostly for governor and Senate) aired in the Phoenix media market than anywhere else in the country, according to the Wes - leyan Media Project, sending airtime costs through the roof. In another district, the $2.5 million raised by the Democratic nominee, 28-year-old Jevin Hodge, might have been impressive for a first-time Black congressional candi - date, who grew up without family wealth. But in the oversaturated Phoenix media market, it was about as effective as putting his campaign message in a bottle and drop - ping it in one of the lakes in nearby Tonto National Forest. The Democratic nominee could afford to make just a single 30-second TV spot, which was half-devoted to eth- ics violations and half to Hodge's earnest pledge, \"I'm running to stop D.C. politicians like Dave Schweikert who just look out for themselves.\" The House Majority PAC po - nied up $1.7 million to run its own version of the attack ad with the key line, \"Career politician David Schweikert admitted to 11 ethics violations,\" while the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent exactly $95 on a toss-up race in a district that Biden carried by 1.5 percent. Ian Russell, who was Hodge's media consultant, said ruefully about the fail - ure of national Democrats in this race: \"The battle-scarred veterans of previous midterms kept looking at the presidential approval rating and thinking it was impos - sible.\" In truth, these national numbers and this wrongheaded historical extrapolation cost the Democrats a House seat that was nearly in their grasp. \"Schweikert was a wounded duck,\" said Chuck Coughlin, a Phoenix-based independent campaign Axne jumped on the flip-flop by running an ad in which a voice-of-doom narrator said, \"Recently Zach Nunn took a stand and agreed that all abortions should be illegal. Now Zach Nunn is lying about his extreme position.\" A national Democratic strategist insist - ed that the Axne tactic worked: \"Without that Nunn primary abortion footage, we could have lost by 6 to 8 points.\" But Link, who did not work on the Axne campaign, fervently disagrees. \"Democrats wanted to focus on abortion because that was working elsewhere,\" he said. \"But we're an older state. Axne would have done a lot better highlighting her votes in Congress to cap insulin prices at $35 and limit drug costs for seniors.\" Losing Margin: 2,145 votes. ARIZONA-1: National Democratic Fail A national Republican poll - ster admitted to me that every two years he is amazed by the political survival of Da - vid Schweikert, who has been holding a Phoenix-area House seat since 2011. Ari - zona Republican activist and former party official Kathy Petsas, who supported less extreme Republican candidates in the mid - term primaries, said about Schweikert, \"He has nine lives. He's like a cat. It's amazing that someone can get out of it with all the baggage he carries around. He shouldn't have won.\" Begin with two interrelated facts about Schweikert and Arizona-1, a district built around Scottsdale and Paradise Valley to the east of Phoenix: The noncharismatic BILL CLARK/CQ-ROLL CALL/GETTY; HEATHER AINSWORTH/AP/SHUTTERSTOCK19 Features March 2023 18It is agonizing to imagine what Frisch could have done with a fraction of the money squandered on the unwinnable Greene race in Georgia. A few more Frisch positive ads would have saved the nation (and, yes, the House Democrats) from having to endure four days of Boebert's self-indulgent antics during the speaker fight. he opposed abortions in any circumstance, including in cases of rape and incest. After the Dobbs decision, the Demo - crats seemingly had a winning issue in a district that Biden had carried by 6 points in 2020. There was only one problem: The Democratic nominee, Tony Vargas, a state senator who supports abortion rights, had an instinct for the capillaries rather than the jugular. Vargas, who raised $3.4 million, preferred to run positive ads and refrained from launching a major attack on Bacon until late in the campaign. A typical Var - gas spot was built around the story of his now-healthy daughter, Ava, being born prematurely. \"We were lucky,\" Vargas said in the ad. \"But access to care shouldn't be about luck. So, as state senator, I fought to expand affordable care for thousands of Nebraskans.\" That would have been a fine commercial if Vargas had been running for reelection to unicameral legislature rather than trying to knock off a difficult-to- dislodge Republican incumbent. Even the national Democratic groups, despite their single-minded emphasis on abortion in other districts, employed a scattershot approach to going after Bacon. For example, in late September a dccc ad predictably attacked Bacon for \"voting to threaten Social Security and to gut Medi- care.\" The House Majority PAC hit Bacon as a mouthpiece for special interests in a com - mercial that began with a weak jibe about the GOP incumbent's name: \"Washington politicians like Mitch McConnell live high on the hog. And Don Bacon is no different.\" In hindsight, some Democratic insiders admit, \"This was a winnable race.\" Ex - cept the Democratic nominee didn't bring home the bacon. Losing Margin: 5,856 votes. Walter Shapiro is a staff writer for The New Republic.\"It wasn't like voters in suburban Oneida County or Syracuse worried about crime themselves. But it connected to other issues like immigration and opioids that did con - cern them.\" In the end, Hochul's political baggage was too much for Conole to lift, even though he ran about 6 points ahead of the governor in the district, according to one Democratic consultant's calculations. A top Democrat in Washington summed up this losing race in a fatalistic tone reminis - cent of the movie line, \"Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown.\" In this case, the Democratic operative said with a sigh, \"New York is really tough in midterms.\" Losing Margin: 2,631 votes. NEBRASKA-2: An Instinct for the Capillaries Don Bacon, who first won this Omaha-centered seat in 2016, is the rare Republican incumbent who still gets away politically with portraying himself as a moderate. Ba - con, for example, was one of just 13 House Republicans who voted in 2021 for Biden's infrastructure bill. Partly reflecting this diverse-for-Nebraska district (11.6 percent Hispanic), Bacon, as a backer of daca, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, has been largely supportive of efforts to pro - tect the \"Dreamers\" from being deported. \"Don Bacon is very good at taking issues off the table,\" conceded a Democratic consul - tant familiar with the race. \"The one area where Bacon's mask slipped was with his unwavering zeal for abortion restrictions.\" Democratic opposition research found a 2016 right-to-life questionnaire in which Bacon had ticked the boxes indicating that Democratic establishment, was assailed by a major primary challenger for his lack of \"personal integrity\" in not repudiating the cryptocurrency super PAC help. Both Williams and Conole prevailed in their primaries. But they secured their nominations too late to do effective fund - raising or map out winning campaigns. Williams only raised a paltry $900,000 for the entire race\u2014and was propped up by, yes, the Congressional Leadership Fund ($5.1 million) and the National Republican Congressional Committee ($1.8 million). Conole, who raised $3 million overall, was strongly backed with another $4.3 million of national Democratic spending on his behalf. Part of the reason for the Democrats' heavy commitment was the competitive nature of the district, which Biden had carried by 7.5 points, and part was that, in the words of a Democratic insider, \"You couldn't write a better biography for an upstate New York Democrat than Conole's.\" By the way, Bankman-Fried, who soon developed preoccupations other than pol - itics, spent no further money in support of Conole in the general election. In his TV ads, Conole played the ex - tremist card against Williams, charging in an emblematic commercial, \"He's a radi - cal Republican who would let politicians outlaw abortion even for victims of rape.\" A negative spot from the Congressional Leadership Fund linked Conole with a woman whom the GOP viewed as even more unpopular with swing voters than Nancy Pelosi: \"If you like Kathy Hochul, you'll love Francis Conole. Albany's bail reform is fueling crime.\" Even though New York's 22nd District is far from the New York Post's circulation area, the crime issue still had powerful re - verberations upstate. Luke Perry, a political scientist at Utica University, explained, NATI HARNIK/AP/SHUTTERSTOCKOne physician's war against the medical-freedom movement Illustration Gironi CarnevaleBy Matthew Hongoltz-HetlingWhat the Doctor Didn't Order23 Features March 2023 22Whitman and his lobbying group, the HealthKeepers Alliance, had come to California in an effort to harmonize the disparate worldviews of the leftist alternative practitioners celebrating mindfulness and the right-wing free-market libertarians cele - brating mind-your-own-businessness. The result was this event, which Whitman branded America's first \"Health Freedom Expo.\" A schedule of presentations from the usual suspects\u2014including Clark, Gerson, and Donsbach\u2014was peppered with talks by right- wing activists such as Diane Miller, a Minnesota lawyer who founded the National Health Freedom Coalition. The freedom activists wanted to recruit alternative practitioners everywhere to a simple if ambitious mission: to change the legal definition of medicine. At the time, most states employed a broad definition that applied to anyone who \"diagnoses, treats, operates for, or prescribes for any ailment, blemish, deformity, disease, disfigurement, disorder, injury, or other physical or mental condition.\" The capacious category allowed the state to jail unlicensed quacks for failing to conform to the exacting rules and regulations of licensing boards. (Clark and Donsbach were among the many who'd faced criminal charges for practicing medicine without a license.) The activists argued that the alternative practitioners at the Health Freedom Expo would be much better off if they could enjoy the privilege of treating patients without being held accountable to traditional standards of practice. This could be done by nar - rowing the definition of medicine and creating a marginal zone of \"wellness\" where naturopaths, aromatherapists, and others could treat patients without being accused of illegally practicing. To achieve such a coup, the whole industry had to unite behind a new message. Previously, such practitioners had, in their efforts to gain legitimacy, tended to emphasize the science (invariably poor) underpinning the (completely contradictory) theories of people like Clark, Gerson, and Donsbach. The activists urged the practitioners to drum up public support by focusing instead on a fundamental American principle: the right of citizens to freely make (and to spend money on) their own health decisions. This message proved to be a potent seed. The Health Freedom Expo spawned dozens of similar events across the country, and soon, buoyed by the efforts of lobbyist groups, including the National Health Freedom Coalition and HealthKeepers, alternative prac - titioners from around the nation were united in a political push for health freedom. One hallmark of the health-freedom movement as it has evolved has been a vibrant conspiracy theory: a belief that the entire med - ical ecosystem\u2014doctors, the government, academic researchers, the World Health Organization\u2014is populated by pharmaceutical shills, colluding in a plot that keeps people sick to maintain profits. Over the past two decades, the motivating force of this conspiracy theory, together with the organizing efforts of the medical-freedom movement, has allowed alternative practitioners to triumph beyond their wildest imaginings. The right-wing medical-freedom campaigners have carried their unscientific beliefs deep into universities, hospitals, legislatures, and the pocket of the American consumer. For the public, the dividends have been dramatic and tragic: billions of wasted dollars, countless assaults on the concept of science, and untold deaths. America's health care landscape, meanwhile, has undergone a quiet sea change. According to surveys from the American Hospital Association, in 1998, just 8 percent of hospitals offered complementary and alternative-medicine services. By 2010, according to a Samueli Institute survey, that number had grown to 42 percent. Since 2000, more than 70 medical and nursing schools have established integrative care programs. Between 2005 and 2015, the proportion of doctors who provided alternative medical services directly out of their offices quadrupled, from 2 percent to 8 percent. Alternative medicine's inroads into the medical establishment have not just made it easier to get Medicare to cover your acu-puncture treatments (possible as of 2020). They have allowed a dangerous political juggernaut to emerge from the shadows. The medical-freedom movement takes dollars spent by sick and des - perate people on long-shot, unproven treatments and converts that money into a powerful lobby that leads more sick and desperate people into early graves. In their drive to legitimize junk science, ac - tivists are ripping at the foundation of medical institutions at a rate Hulda Clark was at the convention, of course. At 76, the dark-haired Canadian naturopath was still going strong, attending natural health expos like this one to publicize and sell her \"Zapper,\" a unit that looked and operated like a scaled-down version of a car battery with jumper cables and was supposed to cleanse the body of cancer-causing parasites. Charlotte Gerson was there, too, talking about \"Gerson Therapy,\" a diet-based cancer treatment that can cost more than $15,000. Then there was Kurt Donsbach, an unlicensed chiropractor whose legal troubles had pushed him to locate his alternative cancer hospital in Mexico. Plenty of healers of lesser reputation were also in attendance, hawking vitamins, minerals, energy bars, and healing crystals. The event seemed like classic L.A.\u2014a consumerist expression of the region's dedication to holistic approaches to health, wellness, and spirituality. But this gathering, the brainchild of Indiana-based supplements manufacturer Wendell W. Whitman, was different. It was 2005, and the expo was\u2014arguably\u2014the moment when alternative healers began to find a potent political voice.23 Features March 2023 22that could soon make it impossible for the average consumer to know where to turn for reliable advice on an evidence-based treatment plan for anything from cancer to a Covid infection. The best line of defense against this threat may be America's existing stock of medical doctors, most of whom were trained in a tradition that predated the maturation of the medical-freedom movement. Multiple surveys show that the number one reason hospitals want to offer alternative medical services is patient demand. And the number one reason they don't is physician resistance. However, the number of doctors who continue to resist what they see as the co-optation of their field has shrunk to a small but vocal minority. Perhaps even too vocal. Consider David Gorski, M.D. BY NATURE SHY AND deeply nerdy, Gorski encountered the case that impelled him into the public sphere in the 1990s, when he was a surgical chief resident learning colorectal surgery. He and his attending phy - sician were working on a patient suspended in the lithotomy position, stirrups spreading legs above the surgical table to allow them as much access as possible to the man's slightly paunchy abdomen and anus. The attending requested suture and scissors. Nurses counted and recounted stitches and instruments to ensure nothing went missing. No one in the operating room mentioned the patient's skin tone, which was a striking orange. According to the medical records, his skin had been an un - remarkable cream color more than a year before. At the time, the attending offered a Stage 1 colorectal cancer diagnosis and recommended surgery to remove the tumor. But the patient, who was in his fifties, had declined. Instead, he pursued a treatment that involved megadoses of vitamins, a strict diet protocol, cof - fee enemas, and enough carrot juice to cause carotenemia, the bloodstream oversaturation of beta-carotenes. Today, Gorski believes the patient's New York City-based alternative provider was offering some variation of a treatment method pioneered in the 1940s by Charlotte Gerson's father, Max Gerson, who argued that pancreatic enzymes could cure cancer. Carotenemia is basically harmless, but leaving a tumor to fester in the colon isn't. After at least a year of carrots and coffee, the patient returned to the hospital in pain, and experiencing brbpr \u2014bright red bleeding per rectum. Because the man's cancer had advanced to Stage 3, the relatively straightforward surgery previously recommended was no longer possible. His best chance to live was now an abdominoperineal resection, a riskier procedure that involves removing the rectum, sphincter, and anus. As chief resident, Gorski ordinarily would have done much of the work, but the cancer was so advanced that most of it fell to the attending. Afterward, they sewed together the hole where the anus used to be, drew the end of the colon through the abdominal wall, and hooked it up to a plastic bag. The patient was lowered onto the table, re-gowned, and wheeled out of the operating room. The surgery had been a success, but not the sort one feels good about. There was a good chance the cancer would recur, and the surgery often caused permanent impotence. The orange would eventually fade from the patient's skin. The colostomy bag was permanent. Though this was Gorski's first experience with the dangers of choosing alternative over conventional medicine, the orange man's story was by no means unique. In 2017, a group of Yale researchers compared outcomes for 560 cancer patients who chose chemo, radiation, or surgery against 280 demographically similar patients who chose alternative therapies. The difference was stark\u2014in fewer than six years, twice as many lung cancer patients who'd chosen alternative treatments were dead. Those with colon cancer died at four times the rate; those with breast cancer, almost six times. When Gorski went on to specialize in breast cancer, he saw those differences in his own patient pool. Sometimes, he said, \"all you can offer is palliation.\" Given the relative deadliness of many alternative practices, it would be natural for the medical establishment to be locked into a pitched battle with quackery, but in fact, prominent sources of medical advice tend to soft-sell their warnings against alterna - tive therapies for cancer patients. \"The choice to use alternative methods is yours,\" the American Cancer Society announces. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention simply recommends that cancer patients talk to their doctor before trying any alternative therapy. The discouragement is tepid because, with an estimated 39 million Americans using some form of complementary or alternative therapy to treat a specific illness, many conventional health care providers are seeking to capitalize on the market by bringing these therapies into hospitals. Before the abdominoperineal resection of the patient with carotenemia, Gorski believed the carrot juice fraud had a right to ply his worthless treatments. Gorski had graduated from his Roman Catholic high school with an ingrained appreciation of the black-and-white moral views of the Republican Party. He believed the pseudoscience spouted by medical quacks was protected free speech that would be best combated in the free market of ideas. But he also believed that the market only worked if the public heard strong, forceful cases for the truth. When it became clear that leading hospitals and medical institutions were failing to make those arguments, he decided to do it himself. BY THE TIME OF the first Health Freedom Expo in 2005, Gorski, who had honed his rhetorical skills demolishing Holocaust deniers in the early internet digital message boards of Usenet, was settling in on a target that seemed more actively dangerous than those conspiracists: practitioners of alternative medicine. To Gorski, the very idea of alternative medicine is a logical fallacy. If a practice works, he says, it devel - ops a body of supporting scientific evidence and becomes simply \"medicine.\" If a practice doesn't work, it is pure bunkum, and therefore not an alternative at all. The typical definition of alternative medicine describes any health treatment not supported by science, which, of course, de - scribed all medicine before the Scientific Revolution of the 1500s. Establishing an effective body of practical, evidence-based medical procedures took hundreds of years; evidence-based medicine only outstripped homeopathy and other unproven treatments around 1910, when, according to Harvard professor Lawrence Henderson, \"for the first time in human history, a random patient with a random disease consulting a doctor chosen at random stood better than a 50-50 chance of benefiting from the encounter.\" In the 113 years since, evidence-based medicine has racked up a staggering number of wins. And yet alternative healing methods\u2014such as Reiki, whose practitioners direct energy into patients' bodies by touching them, or iridology, whose diagnoses March 2023 24Right-wing medical-freedom campaigners have carried their unscientific beliefs deep into universities, hospitals, legislatures, and the pocket of the American consumer. However, this argument is tenuous at best, and dangerous at worst. While it is true that accommodating phony treatments might convince a doctor-averse cancer patient to come in for that chemo treatment, the tacit endorsement is just as likely to convince another patient that chemo is unnecessary because alternative therapies are effective. The accommodation also undermines the reputation of the provider, whose dedication to evidence-based practices can no longer be seen as pure. Mandating public-funded research of, say, anthroposophy (whose practitioners recently treated Covid patients with pellets made of \"the dust of shooting stars\") is not simply wasteful\u2014federal research grants become a key cog in a system designed to force unfounded theories into the annals of proven scientific knowledge. Alternative approaches typically emphasize a holistic framework that runs counter to scientific evidence\u2014invoking something explicitly mystical, like a universal life force, or a thoroughly discredited theory of dis - ease, such as terrain theory, which posits that germs are actually human cells that mutate and cause sickness due to changes in the body's internal \"terrain.\" Gorski argues that the only way to determine whether acupuncture has merit would be to separate the physical processes from their spiritual inspirations and study them alongside conventional practices. \"There are discussions to be had,\" Gorski acknowledged. But \"human beings don't have energy fields that healers can manipulate.\" Gorski began tackling these issues in late 2004, when he launched a blog called Respectful Insolence, using the pseudonym Orac. In his posts, he drew a line at the question of evidence, and treated everyone propping up pseudoscience with the same scorn he had heaped on Holocaust deniers. His targets were legion. After Gwyneth Paltrow unveiled her Goop brand, Gorski called her \"so 'open minded' that her brains fell out.\" The Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons was \"useless as a source of valid scientific articles.\" Mark and David Geier, who argued that vaccines can cause autism, made Gorski feel \"dirty after having had to dive into the bowels of the Geiers' bad science.\" Gorski's alma mater, the University of Michigan School of Medicine, had \"become too accommodating of woo.\" Rashid Buttar, a doctor who used discredited practices to treat cancer, was a \"'rabid dog' that needs to be neutralized so that it can't endanger anyone else.\" The newsletter subscription service Substack was a \"wretched hive of scum and quackery,\" Reiki was \"the wooiest of woo,\" and talk-show host Maher was a \"full-fledged fruitloop.\" Gorski transcended other acerbic bloggers by blending his snark with extensive medical knowledge. As his hard-edged views rippled through cyberspace, he made contact with like- minded science aficionados, many of whom were identifying depend on reading the irises of patients' eyes\u2014that have failed to clear the scientific bar have not simply evaporated. Despite the lack of evidence for homeopathy\u2014whose remedies include an often undetectably small amount of their so-called active ingredients\u2014by 2012, an estimated six million Americans were turning to it. Vulnerable Americans have long been sold a steady stream of quasi-medical services that include cancer-killing magnets, leechings, all-purpose lasers, homeopathic treatments for syphilis, polio-destroying prayers, and herbal remedies for measles. And in the early 1990s, proponents of alternative med - icine scored a massive win at the highest levels of government. A bee-pollen infomercial magnate named Royden Brown (in the process of being fined for making false health claims about bee pollen) convinced Democratic Senator Tom Harkin to take 250 bee-pollen capsules over a five-day period. Believing the pollen cured his allergies, Harkin used a multibillion-dollar U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee bill to set aside $2 million for the National Institutes of Health to explore what the senator called \"unconventional\" medicine. Harkin's maneuver mandated the NIH to establish the Office of Alternative Medicine, which would \"facilitate study and evaluation of complementary and alternative medical practices.\" Eventually, the office became the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, or nccih. FEW DISAGREE THAT some alternative healers make outlandish claims\u2014for example, Jillian Mai Thi Epperly, who has claimed that her Jilly Juice, made from fermented and salted cabbage, can not only eliminate disease but regrow limbs, dramatically lengthen life spans, and \"cure\" ho - mosexuality. But the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health and its allies within the medical community argue that the alternative-medicine landscape is primarily made up of good-faith actors\u2014including many herbalists, yoga masters, massage therapists, and Indigenous healers\u2014whose arguments about health should not be summarily dismissed. Such proponents suggest that even treatments based on sham mysticism might be beneficial because the practices themselves could have merit. Alternative approaches often recommend lifestyle changes that include diet, exercise, and meditative techniques that can reduce stress, mitigate pain, and improve levels of happiness or satisfaction. Supporters of an integra - tive approach say that, as long as an alternative therapy is not actively harmful, it's best to withhold judgment on spiritual matters, and to accommodate by creating a best-of-both-worlds system in which cancer patients can pursue chemo and, say, aromatherapy\u2014the practice of using essential oils for therapeutic benefit\u2014simultaneously. The physician David Gorski has been on a mission since the 2000s to expose medical misinformation. Photograph by Sarah Rice27 Features March 2023 26then gathered at Del Mar, an in-casino bar, to tipple and talk. Gorski met the stage magician Penn Jillette, Adam Savage of the MythBusters TV series, and bloggers like Rebecca \"Skepchick\" Watson and biologist PZ \"Pharyngula\" Myers. Over the years, Gorski's blogging took on a near-obsessive pace. Some months, while working full-time as a doctor, he av - eraged three posts per day, often meaty diatribes of more than 3,000 words. Most weeknights, he sat in the living room with his wife, writing scathing attacks on his laptop while Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! played in the background. Soon, Gorski and other evidence-based medicine advocates were targeted by members of the growing medical-freedom movement. Gorski was doxxed as the man behind Orac; some years later, he was subjected to a letter-writing campaign that sought to get him fired. He received harassing emails, was sued unsuccessfully for libel and defamation, and found his Google reputation poisoned by a website. He was having the time of his life. TWENTY YEARS AGO, the stereotype of the anti-vaxxer was, as Gorski put it, \"the hippie dippy granola crunching sixties leftover.\" But as the medical skeptics labored to be nonpartisan adherents of scientific truth, alternative healers were abandoning their roots and consolidating into a vibrant, populist voting bloc that fit neatly on the right end of the political spectrum. If alternative healers were happy to rally around the idea of medical freedom, imagine how jazzed it made libertarians, who were already using the term to advance their goal of \"a complete separation of medicine from the state.\" This was a much bigger idea than the right of a naturopath to sell sham detoxifying candles. In an article for the Future of Freedom Foundation, the writer Laurence Vance called for the freedom to sell human organs and a free market for ambulance services, meaning that if you live in an area that can't financially support ambulance coverage, you should pack your sorry, heart attack-having ass into the car and drive to the hospital yourself (where, since emergency rooms would also have the right to refuse service for nonpayment, you'd better be ready with your wallet). Libertarians want no medical licensing laws, no Medicaid or Medicare, no federally funded medical research or programs to combat HIV/ aids and Covid-19. They would forever abolish the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the National Institutes of Health. The alliance of alternative healers and libertarians also gave fresh life to what had been a tiny, fringe anti-vax movement. In- deed, around 2010, the health-freedom surge began transforming with an emerging movement that seemed as if it might provide a counterweight to the growing acceptance of alternative- medicine: skepticism. AMERICAN SKEPTICS OF the late aughts spanned the political spectrum, but what bound them together (other than overwhelmingly being white men) was the belief that they could wield critical thinking as a weapon against people who were, well, wrong. Atheists attacked the pious, debunkers attacked psychics, and scientists like Gorski attacked medical misinformationists, all ostensibly to protect the public from various flavors of fraud. As his blog began racking up views, Gorski bought subscriptions to Skeptical Inquirer and Skeptic magazines, and corresponded with members of the James Randi Educational Foundation, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, and the New England Skeptical Society. With others, Dr. Steven Novella, a clinical neurologist at Yale University, and Gorski co-founded a website, Science-Based Medicine. Novella, who also hosts the podcast The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe , is like an extroverted version of Gorski\u2014he iden - tifies as a nerd, and holds many of the same anti-quack positions, but speaks much more smoothly and comfortably. \"The pseudoscientists say, 'Can't we all be respectful?' No,\" Novella told me. \"You are not on the playing field with people who are honest brokers of information. No, you don't get the respect.\" Science-Based Medicine was meant to counter medical misin - formation with essays from doctors and scientists. Under Novella as executive editor and Gorski as managing editor, it took a strictly nonpartisan approach, meaning that it lobbed grenades at both sides. The website debunked the right's positions on climate change and gender-affirming surgeries and the left's positions on genetically modified organisms. Its writers also explained the value of vaccinations, which were distrusted by small numbers of both conservatives and liberals in the 2000s. Alternative healers had their Health Freedom Expo; skeptics, Gorski learned, had the Amaz!ng Meeting, a skeptic conference overseen by James \"the Amazing\" Randi. A natural showman, Randi rose to national prominence in 1972, when he appeared on Johnny Carson's The Tonight Show to debunk the spoon-bending psychic Uri Geller. Randi's organization became the bedrock for the modern skeptic community, and in 2003 the James Randi Educational Foundation drew 150 attendees to its inaugural conference. By the time Gorski attended, in 2009, the event's buzzing, rowdy energy attracted more than 1,000 attendees to the Nevada casino where it was held that year. Speakers present - ed on exorcism, poker, and woo in martial arts. Skeptics folded origami flying pigs (the Pigasus) and used mock dowsing rods, In 1998, just 8 percent of hospitals offered complementary and alternative medicine services. By 2010, that number had grown to 42 percent.27 Features March 2023 26Donald Marcus of the Baylor College of Medicine pointed out in a 2020 article in The Journal of Clinical Investigation . The National Library of Medicine lists 49 different nccih-funded studies that reference homeopathy; some of the study authors lack med - ical degrees, and yet have associations with top-tier medical institutions\u2014for instance, Ted Kaptchuk, an acupuncturist who went on to direct an alternative-medicine program at Harvard Medical School; or Gary Schwartz, whose research at the University of Arizona is focused primarily on mediums and energy healing. The alternative-health industry also influences academia through overt lobbying. And even as it enjoys the financial benefits that come with being embraced by the political right (Americans spent $34 billion on products and services in 2007), it has aggressively wooed the academic circles that are usually dominated by the political left. For example, in 2017, after re - ceiving a $200 million gift from the Henry and Susan Samueli Foundation, the University of California Irvine earmarked funds for up to 15 faculty chairs supporting a curricular focus on inte - grative health in its College of Health Sciences. Deep-pocketed alternative-medicine groups have also funded partnerships with University of California San Francisco, Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Sidney Kimmel Medical Col - lege of Thomas Jefferson University, and Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. As of 2017, 15 research medical schools had begun offering alternative medicine to the public, according to Marcus. Johns Hopkins offers Reiki \"to transmit Universal Life Energy to the client\"; Duke University offers acupuncture for stroke victims. Infiltration of government and academia by alternative med - icine left the skeptics championing evidence-based medicine on the outs. And the skeptic community, meanwhile, had its own problems. In 2011, Rebecca \"Skepchick\" Watson posted a video describing her experiences at a male-dominated skeptic confer - ence in Ireland. In the wee hours of the morning, she parted from friends in a hotel bar. A man who had not spoken to her previously got into an elevator with her, then asked her back to his hotel room for coffee. It made Watson uncomfortable. \"Just a word to the wise here, guys,\" Watson said. \"Don't do that.\" The gentle rebuke is only a small section of the video, but it sparked a huge outcry, dubbed Elevatorgate. Many skeptics rushed to defend the anonymous man, while others saw Watson as the latest victim of a systemic misogyny permeating the skeptic community. The disagreement made it impossible to ignore the group's deep political divisions. Watson's critics were mainly con - servatives, the old guard who believed skeptics were best-served poking holes in reports of UFOs. Her supporters constituted a new coterie of young progressives who wanted to tackle political falsehoods and champion social justice issues. Gorski, who had just begun to relax into the comfort of skeptic camaraderie, was uncharacteristically silent on Elevatorgate. But his brand of skepticism was suddenly attracting new criti - cism. Kavin Senapathy, a science writer, social justice advocate, and friend of Gorski, whom she got to know when they were both speakers at skeptic gatherings, called him self-important, a buck-passer, and \"uninterested in examining the role he plays in upholding the status quo.\" (She also described him as \"thoughtful, caring, funny, witty, and nerdy.\") Senapathy feels that Gorski's focus on quackery glosses over \"the most insidious forms of pseudoscience in medicine.\" For example, false assumptions anti-vax views into a core right-wing value. By 2015, anti-vax messages cloaked within anti-governmental calls for health free - dom had deeply penetrated the Republican voting base, causing large numbers of Americans to reject routine vaccines. It was an ideological bait and switch for millions of conservatives. As Gorski put it, \"Come for the freedom, stay for the anti-vax.\" But the successful assimilation came with a price to alternative health practitioners, who were swallowed by the greater right- wing populist movement. Herbal supplements became a staple of conservative media outlet sponsorships and offerings; a rash of news stories reported on the presence of right-wing conspiracy theories in the yoga community. At the same time, some libertarians were unhappy to find that their vision of a sweeping health-freedom movement had been largely reduced to a single idea: resistance to vaccination. Anti-vax views were central for quack practitioners whose live - lihoods depended on a distrust of establishment medicine, but principled libertarian academics\u2014those most likely to identify as skeptics\u2014were less enthralled. Journal articles by libertarian philosophers like Jason Brennan and Jessica Flanigan argued that \"vaccine refusal harms and risks harming innocent bystanders.\" Even Gary Johnson, Libertarian presidential nominee in 2012 and 2016, came to believe that a scientific understanding of herd immunity required libertarians to support vaccine mandates. Gorski had by then seen too many cancer victims who could only be offered palliation. After enumerating the sins of a thou - sand quacks with ties to the science-scorning medical-freedom movement, he relinquished his conservative ideals. Now, he jokes about his libertarian roots. \"You've heard the quote about Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged ?\" Gorski said, paraphrasing blogger John Rogers: \"One is a book that appeals to juvenile minds with unreal - istic fantasies of power and freedom, and the other one has orcs.\" ONE IMPORTANT CHECK ON medical misinformation is the vibrant ecosystem of journals and universities that act as the main repository for scientific thought. But there are signs that alternative practitioners are compromising the entire system. This often begins at the Na - tional Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, where the once-$2 million budget had grown to $159.4 million by fiscal year 2022. The center has funded research on homeopathy, acu - puncture, and craniosacral therapy (lightly touching the cranium to relieve putative blockages). Merely being investigated at the center can lend a practice credibility, regardless of what the research actually finds. A double-blinded study of acupuncture found, for example, that inserting needles into the skin (intended to relieve obstacles to the flow of life energy, or qi) did reduce pain, but with a big caveat. As Novella pointed out, the data \"pretty much universally show no difference between real acupuncture and placebo acupuncture.\" Nevertheless, the study authors mischaracterize the results in press releases summarizing their research findings to credulous media outlets and the public, arguing that both the placebo and acupuncture work. \"If the treatment is no better than the placebo, then it didn't work,\" Novella noted. \"They're trying to rewrite the rules of science.\" Between 1999 and 2017, nccih had spent a total of about $2.2 billion \"for clinical trials [that] produced no sound, consis - tent evidence for the efficacy of any alternative therapies,\" Dr. 29 Features March 2023 28Freedom Coalition advocate for Safe Harbor Exemption Laws that narrow the legal definition of medicine and ensure bogus medical treatments can be sold to the public without typical state oversight or regulation. For example, in 2019, Maine passed \"An Act to Establish the Right to Practice Complementary and Alternative Health Care Act,\" which seeks to establish a trade-off by allowing alternative practitioners to operate legally, as long as they don't perform sur - gery, represent themselves as doctors, or advise their customers to discontinue medications or drugs that have been prescribed by actual medical professionals, among other restrictions. The medical-freedom movement has passed similar Safe Harbor laws in 11 states, mostly in the last 20 years; many specifically sanction such practices as energetic healing, Gerson therapy, and Reiki. More recently, the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the progress of the health-freedom movement, but also narrowed its focus to public health recommendations like masking, social distancing, and, of course, vaccinations. In 2021, National Health Freedom Action, which has tracked the passage of health-freedom bills in 18 states, noted that 46 states were considering medical- freedom proposals; many of these bills involved the right to refuse vaccinations or to refuse Covid diagnostics. In 2021, California debated a bill that would have explicitly forbidden the state to \"restrict a person's constitutional right to make health decisions for themselves ... or place conditions on a person's ability to receive public benefits based on their decision to decline\" treatments, including diagnostic tests or vaccinations. Since July 2021, New Hampshire has passed no fewer than seven right-to-refuse laws, all of them preventing the government, employers, or public facilities, including hospitals, from pressuring people to get vaccinated. And in May 2022, Arizona, which already prevented schools from screening out unvaccinated students from their grounds, adopted language specifying that kids who weren't vaccinated against HPV could also attend. The 2022 midterms also suggested that the movement remains vibrant and ready to strike on multiple issues. The activist group Stand for Health Freedom endorsed 642 candidates that it found to be health-freedom friendly, and the group also took credit for momentum behind a federal bill to defund the World Health Organization, saying that it motivated 137,000 constituents to reach out to their representatives, paving the way for 46 lawmakers to sign on to the bill in just one month. Three people who held anti-vaccine views were even elected to the nine-member board of the Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida. IN THE FACE OF THESE powerful forces, Gorski, motivated by his inner moral compass, had the courage to keep throw - ing stones. In April 2021, when celebrity doctor Drew Pinsky argued that vaccine passports \"segregate people and strip them of their freedom to travel internationally,\" his claim sparked a Gorski-Pinsky Twitter tiff. Gorski said that Pinsky was the latest of a growing number of M.D.s who were playing into the hands of the anti-vaccine movement. \"These once-respected doctors,\" he wrote, \"are pathetic shells of their former selves, scientifically speaking.\" Pinsky made an effort to reach out to Gorski, but Gorski refused to get on the phone with Pinsky. To Gorski, the stakes seemed too high for him to be forgiving. In July and August 2021 alone, the health-freedom movement's success in spreading vaccine hesitance resulted in an estimate of at about biology underpin racism in medicine that Senapathy called dehumanizing and \"far more harmful than, say, homeopathy.\" Gorski describes himself as an aspiring ally of marginalized communities, and has in recent years begun to identify as a center-left Democrat with progressive views on social justice issues. Though the once-shy blogger has gotten more comfort - able speaking to audiences within the skeptic community, it's clear that his efforts aren't nearly enough to stem the tide of junk science. Over 18 years of his fighting, the world has tipped against him. Everywhere he casts his eyes, he sees quackery flourishing. Since 2010, public suspicions about medical science have grown. Every year, crazier beliefs emerge\u2014that injecting baking soda into the veins can prevent cancer, that drinking a bleach solution can cure Covid, that the government can remotely control the vaccinated. Meanwhile, potential allies have drifted away. According to Senapathy, progressives have lost patience for the skeptic move - ment's \"almost willful immaturity.\" Many of the people doing excellent skepticism, she said, have never even heard of the skeptic movement, let alone identified with it. \"It's probably a bit too late for this generation,\" Gorski reflected. \"I think the teaching of critical thinking needs to begin in kindergarten.\" But teaching kindergartners would be difficult, because \"you would have to have adults to teach it. And large swaths of our adults do not have those tools.\" Even his ruminations include insults. The medical skeptics have also lost ground with their col- leagues. A 2011 academic analysis by the National Center for Health Statistics found that 63 percent of people who did not work in health care had personally used some form of complementary and alternative medicine over the past year; shockingly, among health care workers, the number was significantly higher, at 76 percent; and within those workers the category with the highest usage was providers, including doctors and nurses, at 83 percent. An nccih-funded survey found that a slight majority of doctors were recommending complementary health alternatives such as guided imagery, massage therapy, chiropractic, homeopathy, supplements, acupuncture, hypnosis, naturopathy, and yoga to patients. The medical skeptics were rising above partisan politics, getting every fact right, winning every argument, and still losing the war. EVEN AS THE skeptic movement has, in its pursuit of truth, failed to gain political traction, the medical-freedom movement has been flexing its muscles in a sustained legislative push with local, state, and federal lawmakers. If the goal of alternative-medicine proponents is to maintain the practices while minimizing the risk of harm, one solution might be found in Nevada, where roughly 50 homeopathic practitioners are licensed or certified under the state-sanctioned Nevada Board of Homeopathic Medical Examiners. The board, which is made up of a mixture of homeopathic practitioners and members of the public, imposes standards of practice, hears complaints, conducts investigations, and imposes disciplinary actions on its licensees. But in 2016 Diane Miller (who spoke at the Health Freedom Expo of 2005) argued that such oversight meant \"profession - al, lay homeopaths cannot practice freely there.\" Miller says regulations and oversight are unnecessary in a practice that carries little risk of harm. Instead, she and the National Health 29 Features March 2023 28While hospitals' accommodation of phony treatments might convince a doctor-averse cancer patient to try chemo, the tacit endorsement is just as likely to convince another patient that alternative therapies are effective. super PACs, and lobbying. And the Center for Public Integrity cited examples of drug companies influencing the committees that advised states on Medicaid by buying members dinners, hiring them for consulting gigs, convincing speakers to give favorable testimony without disclosing financial ties, and even filling out the doctors' paperwork needed to get costly drugs approved by state Medicaid programs. But there's a difference between understanding that cor - porate lobbying subverts the public interest, and a conspiracy theory, touted by medical-freedom advocates, that the entire system\u2014including a robust network of media and patient ad - vocacy groups\u2014is controlled by shadowy figures that impose harmful vaccines and drugs on the public. Unlocking the key to exposing that falsehood could help Gorski debunk a thousand quacks in one fell swoop. But for now, the Trojan Horse was admitted, the ghost is in the machine, and the patients are running the asylum. Gorski said that the influ - ence of the health-freedom movement winds up politicizing the decisions of public health officials and M.D.s. The politics interfere with \"doctors and physicians doing their job,\" he said. \"The misinformation gets into the govern - ment, which starts to meddle with what the scientists do based on the misinformation.\" This understanding, shared by many medical science skeptics, creates an odd sort of rhyme with their ideological foes. In their argument, the entire medical ecosystem\u2014doctors, the govern-ment, academic researchers, the World Health Organization\u2014is in thrall to alternative-medicine shills, colluding in a plot that keeps people sick to maintain profits. Gorski persists in his quack-bashing passion, now buttressing his blog posts with a relentless stream of sharp-elbowed tweets. He used to enjoy contradicting a wrong for the sake of it. Now, the project sometimes feels hopeless. A 2018 survey found that 39 percent of Americans incorrectly believe alternative medicine alone can cure cancer; among young adults aged 18 to 37, the num - ber was even higher, 47 percent. And research shows that people who feel positively about alternative health are more susceptible to medical misinformation. Though he thinks victory may be a generation away, Gorski continues, attacking mountains with a mallet, bailing the tide with a teaspoon. If current trends continue, the standard of truth he is upholding will soon be so out of sync with accepted medical practice that he himself will be fighting for the alternative point of view. Matthew Hongoltz-Hetling is the author of If It Sounds Like a Quack ...: A Journey to the Fringes of American Medicine, forthcoming in April.least 16,000 unnecessary American deaths due to undervaccination in communities. Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher and medical doctor, said in a video for the World Health Organization that 200,000 Americans had died in the last half of 2021 and early 2022 because they refused a Covid vaccine. In this context, any - thing less than full-throated support for vaccines from a person of influence is potentially deadly. Some leaders in the public health sphere have been working to understand how to prevent those deaths, and have rolled out public health education campaigns, such as those encouraging indoor mask use, that try to cultivate a tone that will be palatable to their target audience. Gorski's far more bristling approach, birthed in the baptismal fires of Usenet flame wars, is a good representation of skeptic culture, where the quality of the information is far more important than civility. That attitude might be counterproductive.Pinsky said he's \"an absolute fan\" of website Science-Based Medicine's goals and overall efforts, but also sees in them \"a hu- bristic attitude that bugs\" him. The magician (and skeptic) Penn Jillette called skeptics \"one of the most entitled communities ever.\" And when philosopher (and blogger) Massimo Pigliucci left the movement, he described \"an ugly undertone of in-your-face confrontation ... a willingness to engage in public shaming and other vicious social networking practices.\" If the point of medical skepticism is to humiliate quacks in front of a small but appreciative choir, tone doesn't matter. But if the goal is to expand a movement, the marketing of the message is as important as the message itself. Gorski is unlikely to overhaul his tone at this point, but his recent reflections on 18 years spent battling misinformation have led him to explore a new tactic of his own. Quacks, he now realizes, \"are not a legion of independent frauds.... The more time goes on, the more I appreciate that it's not enough to debunk various claims. I think it's necessary to do pre-bunking.\" Pre-bunking? The idea is a sort of Grand Unified Theory of anti-quackery. \"All anti-vaccine claims are based in conspiracy theory. All science denial is a conspiracy theory,\" Gorski explained. These quacks rely on the same rotten framework: that a massive net - work of compromised individuals is working to prop up the medical-governmental industrial complex. This idea is difficult to debunk, largely because there is a ker - nel of truth to it. An analysis of public data, published in jama Internal Medicine , showed that, between 1999 and 2018, the pharmaceutical and health product industry spent more than $6 billion on campaign contributions, outside groups such as Illustration by Zach MeyerHOW THE GOP LOST ITS BRAIN By Timothy NoahThe recent fight over the speakership proved the point yet again: Today's Republican Party is driven by egos and power rivalries, not ideas. The GOP once had ideas\u2014lots of them. The problem was that they were unpopular and bad. 33 Features March 2023 32IN 1960, the sociologist Daniel Bell published a book titled The End of Ideology that argued the ideological battles of the nineteenth and twenti - eth centuries had subsided. A \"rough consensus\" had emerged, Bell wrote, at least in the West, on the need for a welfare state, a mixed economy, and political pluralism. President John F. Kennedy echoed Bell's theme in a speech at Yale's 1962 commencement. \"The central domestic issues of our time,\" Kennedy said, relate not to basic clashes of philosophy or ideology but to ways and means of reaching common goals\u2014to research for sophisticated solutions to complex and obstinate issues.... What is at stake in our economic decisions today is not some grand warfare of rival ideologies which will sweep the country with passion, but the practical management of a modern economy. The moment didn't last. Ideological war - fare resumed in the United States with the rise of the New Left in the late 1960s and with the rise of the New Right in the ear - ly 1980s. Today, those ideological storms have subsided. This time, though, ideolo - gy is over not because right and left have reached rough consensus; far from it. The contest is done because the Republican Party walked off the field. We have arrived at the end of GOP ideology. Obviously, we haven't reached the end of political division; that's worse today than it's been since liberals and conser - vatives duked it out during the '60s and '70s over civil rights, the Vietnam War, and Watergate. Indeed, the angry preju - dices, paranoia, and folklore ricocheting through social media, talk radio, and Fox News enjoy much greater reach today than they did half a century ago. To the contemporary ear, the word \"ide - ology\" is synonymous with that kind of toxic stew. But when I say that GOP ideology has ended, I'm using the word differently. I'm not using it to describe pathologies, or resentments, or ethnic hatreds. I'm not using it to describe the mob's surrender to an authoritarian leader. I'm not using it in any of the broadly pejorative senses in which the term is commonly used today. Rather, I'm using the word \"ideology\" to describe, in a neutral manner, some set of reasoned and coherent principles and policies, however mistaken, around which a society can be organized. That's how Bell (mostly) used the term. He called ideology \"the commitment to the consequences of ideas.\" The GOP no longer even pretends that its pursuit of power is rooted in any such commitment. The conservative ideas that came to fruition four decades ago during Ronald Reagan's presidency didn't stand the test of time, either because they were faulty from the start or because circum - stances and public opinion changed, and the few new ideas taken up by some Re - publicans in recent years inspire too much disagreement, within either the party or the broader electorate, to rise to the level of party doctrine. The Republicans' fail - ure to produce a party platform in 2020 proved beyond a doubt that there was no such thing as a GOP ideology. There re - mains none today. Instead, we have what is commonly, and accurately, described by political observers, including many conservatives, as GOP nihilism: a party's self-perpetuation for its own sake driven by an opportunistic indifference to fact and reason, expressed through coarse and incendiary rhetoric. WHEN YOU really pay attention to how today's Republicans speak, I don't know how you can call it ideological. During January's 15-ballot donny - brook over choosing the next House speaker, was it ideo - logical for Representative Kat Cammack, Republican of Florida, to accuse Demo - crats of bringing \"popcorn and blankets and alcohol\" to watch her party's display of disunity? When the Dem - ocrats howled in outrage at this strangely arbitrary fabrication, was it ideological for Cammack to add, \"As evidenced by my col - leagues' actions\"? Give me a break. Witless, juvenile, and pointless, yes. Ideological? Don't flatter her. The most nihilistic project of the new majority-GOP House is the establishment of a Select Subcommittee on the Weapon - ization of the Federal Government. This is a brazen play to run interference against the various criminal investigations of for - mer President Donald Trump. The select subcommittee's chairman, Jim Jordan, is also chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Jordan's chairmanship of the select subcommittee is a glaring conflict of interest, given that, along with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Jordan refused to comply with a subpoena during the last Congress from the committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. Jordan defend - ed Trump during two impeachments, and he told Fox News after the 2020 election, \"I don't know how you can ever convince me that President Trump didn't actually win this thing.\" The weaponization subcommittee's foremost target will be the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which during Trump's presidency became a whipping boy for the right, contradicting the GOP's claim to champion law and order. In addition to protecting Trump as best it can, the sub - committee will discourage the FBI from (to quote language from a Republican Judiciary Committee staff report issued in November) \"artificially inflating statis - tics about domestic violent extremism in the nation.\" An imagined leftist \"double standard\" in investigating terrorism is one of Jordan's favorite hobbyhorses, and it's sheer denialism. No honest expert disputes that violent political extremism in the Unit - ed States is overwhelmingly domestic in nature, and that the bulk of it comes from the right. That's been true going all the way back to 1948, according to a 2022 report by criminologist Gary LaFree of the University of Maryland and others. What's new is the right's boldness in expressing support for political violence. A November 2021 poll by the nonprofit Public Religion Research Institute found that three times as many Republicans as Democrats agreed with the statement, \"Because things have gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.\" No fewer than 30 percent of Republicans concurred. OPENING SPREAD: GETTY (X3)33 Features March 2023 32These \"true American patriots\" went kinetic on January 6, 2021. Initially the Republican National Committee voiced outrage. \"These violent scenes we have wit - nessed do not represent acts of patriotism,\" an RNC statement said, \"but an attack on our country and its founding principles.\" Alas, this view was not sustainable, and in February 2022 the RNC excused the riots, incredibly, as a form of \"legitimate polit - ical discourse.\" There is no conservative principle that would permit violence and vandalism to bar Congress from certifying a presidential election. The Republican Party signaled most de - finitively that the cupboard was bare when President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and deputy campaign manager Bill Stepien (who in mid-July 2020 became campaign manager) turned their attention to writing the 2020 Republican platform. Political reporters tend to downplay the importance of party platforms, and certainly their influence has diminished over time. But platforms remain significant in clarifying what it is that a party stands for, and even what laws may get passed. Lee Payne, a political scientist at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas, examined party platforms from 1980 to 2004 and found that members of Congress voted in accordance with their party platforms 82 percent of the time. For Republicans, it was 89 percent of the time. \"So, yes,\" Payne told Vox, \"I would say it matters.\" Kushner and Stepien wanted a GOP platform that was less lengthy than the 58-page 2016 platform and more appealing to swing voters. In 2016, the Trump cam - paign had stayed out of the process, giving the Christian right a free hand. (The sole exception was that a campaign aide per - suaded the platform committee to soften its language supporting military aid to Ukraine.) As a result, the 2016 platform ended up saying, among other things, that the Supreme Court's ruling affirming a right to gay marriage \"robbed 320 million Americans of their legitimate constitution - al authority to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman.\" At a Decem - ber 2019 meeting reported by Jonathan Swan of Axios, Kushner said he wanted to avoid repeating anti-gay rhetoric. A one-page platform was produced, according to Swan, and Trump was all for it. But the Axios story infuriated party activists, and, rather than ignore them or negotiate changes, Trump and the Re - publican National Committee dispensed with a party platform altogether, citing, implausibly, logistical difficulties resulting from the Covid outbreak. (The Democrats, during the same pandemic, had no difficul - ty producing a platform of their own.) To justify its decision, the Republican National Committee adopted a resolution affirm - ing that, if a platform had been written, it \"undoubtedly\" would have reasserted, unanimously, \"the party's strong support for Donald RNC committeeman New Jersey, told me. \"They were just following orders.\" In effect, the Republi - can Party pledged to favor whatever it was Donald Trump would want to achieve in his second term. But nobody could identify what that was\u2014least of all Trump himself. Trump made his lack of an agenda abun - dantly clear in a series of TV interviews in the summer of 2020. During convention week, Peter Baker of The New York Times asked Trump to lay out a second-term agen - da. Here is how Trump answered: But so I think, I think it would be, I think it would be very, very, I think we'd have a very, very solid, we would continue what we're doing, we'd solidify what we've done, and we have other things on our plate that we want to get done. By this time, Trump's campaign, probably in response to negative stories about the GOP's null-set platform, had released a list of 50 \"core priorities\" for the second term, including tax cuts, cuts to prescription drug prices, and \"teach American exceptional - ism.\" But Trump wouldn't parrot even these largely platitudinous policy goals. He either didn't read them, didn't remember them, or didn't find them particularly interesting. Writing for Politico that summer, Tim Alberta asked Frank Luntz, the pollster who helped Newt Gingrich develop the GOP's \"Contract With America\" in 1994, to tell him what the Republican Party stood for. \"I can't do it,\" Luntz replied. \"For the first time in my life, I don't know the answer.\" TODAY, DONALD TRUMP IS no longer president, and his prospects for returning to the White House look bleak. Republican officehold - ers remain wary of crossing Trump, but Trump's influence over the Re - publican Party was weakened by the GOP's disappointingly small gains in the midterm elections. Still, the Republican Party continues to be - lieve, like Trump, in nothing. That isn't to say the GOP lacks ideolog - ical factions. There are 222 Republicans in the House and 49 in the Senate. Among these are libertarians, moderates (yes, a few remain), foreign policy hawks, noninterven - tionists, fiscal conservatives, supply-siders, abortion opponents, abortion supporters, pro-business traditionalists, and anti- business populists. There have always been ideological divisions among Republicans. What's new is that these factions no longer share anything resembling a set of princi-ples. Increasingly, they don't bother even to pretend. Meanwhile, Republican ranks The Republicans' failure to produce a party platform in 2020 proved beyond a doubt that there was no such thing as a GOP ideology. Instead, we have GOP nihilism: a party's self-perpetuation for its own sake driven by an opportunistic indifference to fact and reason, expressed through coarse and incendiary rhetoric.35 Features March 2023 34news when Representative Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican, called President Bill Clinton a \"scumbag\" in an interview with the editorial board of The Indianapolis Star . People found this unacceptably vulgar because the literal meaning of \"scumbag\" is \"semen-filled condom.\" Representative Henry Waxman, a California Democrat, was so outraged that he circulated a letter about it among committee members. In those days, members of Congress simply didn't talk like that. What a difference 25 years makes. During his successful 2022 Ohio Senate race against Democrat Tim Ryan, J.D. Vance, the freshman Ohio senator, could scarcely get a sentence out that didn't include the word \"scumbag.\" Hardly any- body noticed. Ryan, of course, was a \"total scumbag.\" Republicans who \"listen to the donors more than they do to their own voters\" were \"basically scumbags.\" The big tech companies were \"a bunch of corrupt scumbags.\" The entire country of Vene - zuela consisted of \"scumbags\" (though, to be fair, Vance meant mostly President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who admittedly has a terrible record on human rights). Vance made \"scumbag\" his mantra to sound intellectually lazy from dominating policy debate during the previous half-century, often lost. You see very little of that today. Instead, there's a lot of name-calling. Republicans have graduated from tagging Democrats as \"socialists\" (which in the cases of Ver - mont Senator Bernie Sanders and New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez is true, though Sanders is actually a political independent who caucuses with Democrats) to calling them \"communists.\" Thus South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, writing two years ago in The Federalist , marveled that \"Georgia, of all places, could elect two communists to the United States Senate.\" Noem was talking about Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff. A 2022 ad by the Georgia Gun Owners Inc. recycled the ac- cusation, this time against Warnock and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, making it evident that \"commu - nist\" was being used as a code word for \"Black.\" In response, PolitiFact ploddingly affirmed that no, Warnock and Abrams were not communists. Another insult Republicans have ushered into the mainstream of public discourse is \"scumbag.\" A quarter-century ago, it was have been fattened by self-contradicting opportunists like Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida (who said McCarthy \"sold shares of himself\" in the form of the concessions he made to win the speakership, then later called these same concessions \"a big win for the House of Representatives\") and Repre - sentative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia (who called President Joe Biden \"a piece of shit\" for pulling troops out of Afghanistan, then later denigrated military service by saying it was \"throwing your life away\"). The only thing that unites these cynics with the GOP's other antagonistic factions is their professed loathing of Democrats. It's a very far cry from July 1980, when Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moyni - han pronounced the GOP \"the party of ideas\": supply-side economics, the im - permanence of authoritarian regimes (argued by Jeane Kirkpatrick in her influ - ential Commentary essay \" dictatorships & double-standards \"), the welfare trap, the Soviet Union as Evil Empire, and so on.

Founded in 1985 by the neoconservative Irving Kristol as a forum for the hawkish interventionism then ascendant in Wash - ington, it was acquired in 2001 by a think tank that had been created by former Pres - ident Nixon after the breakup of the Soviet Union to advance the more cautious realist school favored by Nixon and Henry Kissing - er. The think tank, which had been called the Nixon Center, changed its name to the Center for the National Interest, reflecting that its focus was shifted to publishing. The center's president was Dimitri Simes, a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 and respected foreign policy expert who had been close to Nixon. The National Interest retained influence as a source of views that were more eclectic than those in the 1980s and 1990s. But circulation dropped steeply while Simes drew an extravagant salary of more than $400,000. In 2016, Simes compromised the center's independence (not to mention its respectability) by becoming a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. He looked enough like an intermediary between Trump and Vladimir Putin's re - gime in Russia to draw attention in the Mueller Report. A redacted portion, later leaked to the Washington Examiner's Ste - ven Nelson, said Simes told Jared Kushner that the Russians possessed a recording of former President Bill Clinton having phone sex with Monica Lewinsky. In 2018, Simes became co-host of a public affairs show, Bolshaya Igra, broadcast on a Russian TV network in which the Russian government held a majority stake. Inevitably, The National Interest started running articles favorable to Putin and Trump. In 2015, Maria Butina, who would later do jail time for being an unregistered foreign agent for Russia (and who last fall assumed office as a member of Russia's State Duma), opined in the journal, \"It may take the election of a Republican to the White House ... to improve relations between the Russian Federation and the United States.\" Putin himself penned a 2020 article disputing a resolution passed by the baffling McCarthyite witch hunts that had only recently ended. The Trilling-Bell view of conservatism is today in disrepute, with scholars noting that it overlooked, among others, Friedrich Hayek, Russell Kirk, James Burnham, and Ludwig von Mises. Bell made only a single reference to Hayek and consigned Burnham to a footnote. But if conservative ideology was so easy for a brilliant scholar like Bell to ignore in a book titled The End of Ideol - ogy, that suggests it hadn't penetrated the culture very far. That started to change with the founding of National Review in 1955 and, later, the nomination of Barry Goldwater in 1964. Conservative ideology reached its sum - mit with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. Republicans judged themselves representative of what President Richard Nixon had called the Silent Majority and what the Reverend Jerry Falwell now called the Moral Majority. The GOP retook, in 1980, not only the White House, but also the Senate, having not acquired a congres - sional majority in either house for 28 years. Republicans' competitiveness as a leg- islative party has lasted, and it has even spread, during the past decade, to state legislatures. But its intellectual renaissance did not. \"Nearly as soon as Reagan left of - fice,\" Vanderbilt historian Nicole Hemmer writes in her 2022 book, Partisans: The Conservative Revolutionaries Who Remade American Politics in the 1990s , the conser - vative movement was \"skittering away from the policies, rhetoric, and even ideology that Reagan had brought.\" The biggest reason for the change was the end of the Cold War. That weakened the Republican justification for a strong de - fense. A \"Defense Planning Guidance,\" drafted in 1992 under the hawkish Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, said the new pri - mary purpose of military policy was \"to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival.\" But after that language leaked to The New York Times , the Republican administration of President George H.W. Bush beat a hasty retreat. A decade later, as Russian President Vladimir Putin started to consolidate pow- er, conservatives split over whether he was friend or foe. Somewhat shockingly, that split persists now that Putin has crushed internal dissent and is waging a brutal war of reconquest against Ukraine. Today, even the GOP's historic commitment to defense spending is up for grabs as Kevin McCarthy calls for $75 billion in cuts to the defense earthier and not-of-the-establishment to working-class Ohio voters. As the conser - vative writer Christopher Caldwell noted in The New York Times , the word \"scumbag\" was absent from Vance's much-admired bestselling 2016 memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, which sought to bridge the same gap be - tween Red and Blue America that Vance widened in his 2022 campaign. THE WORD \"NIHILISM,\" invented by nineteenth-century Germans and Russians, originally described a revolutionary's idealistic rejec - tion of outmoded beliefs. Friedrich Nietzsche fixed its present, more sour definition as a conviction that one's beliefs and actions have no meaning or purpose. The earlier definition may help explain why contemporary political nihilists of - ten claim to be ushering in a glorious new order. But ask this nihilist what that new or- der might be, and the answer is going to be gibberish. (A more colloquial synonym for nihilist is \"bullshit artist.\") For about a century, the word \"nihilism\" has been associated with decline. The nihilistic turn of the GOP is very much a sign of the party's broader decline. It didn't happen overnight. Trump was the parasite, but the host had been weakening for decades. For much of the twentieth century, it was a matter of dispute whether American conservatism had ever existed as an ideol - ogy. Lionel Trilling famously wrote in The Liberal Imagination (1950) that the conservative impulse and the reactionary impulse do not, with some isolated and some ecclesiastical exceptions, express themselves in ideas but only in action or in irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas. That's pretty much the line Bell took in The End of Ideology , too. Bell dedicated only a single chapter to conservatism; the ideol - ogy with which he was more concerned, and the one he saw ending, was Marxism. Bell judged conservatism less an ideology than a pathology rooted in \"the peculiar evangelism of Methodism and Baptism, with its high emotionalism\" and \"excess of sinning.\" (Bell insisted it was mistaken to identify moral hysteria, as many still do, with Puritanism.) This evangelism ex - plained what, to Bell, were the otherwise 37 Features March 2023 36By the time Trump entered office in 2017, the crime rate had fallen by more than half, divorcing tough-on-crime rhetoric from any discernible reality. When Trump spoke of \"American carnage\" in his inaugural address, he was criticized widely for being out of touch; even many Republicans had turned their attention to criminal justice reform. The following year, Trump ended up signing into law the First Step Act, which shortened federal prison sentences and initiated other reforms. A rise in the murder rate during the Covid pandemic later cooled GOP enthusiasm for sentencing reform, but crime remains well below levels endured during the 1980s. In 1993, William Bennett, who'd been education secretary under Reagan and drug czar under George H.W. Bush, initiated under the auspices of three conservative think tanks a series of annual reports called The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators . In his introduction to the second edition in 1994, Bennett said that \"the forces of social decomposition\" seemed \"impervious to government spending.\" But within a few years Bennett had to give up the project, because too many of the indicators were improving (to add insult to injury, under a Democratic president!). Today, the di - vorce rate is nearly half what it was when Reagan came into office. The teen birth rate, which was already declining when Bennett began his series, cratered after 1990 and is now near historic lows, thanks of course to contraception and also some decline in sexual activity among younger teens. Welfare participation is down due to President Bill Clinton's welfare reform, which imposed time limits on cash benefits. The high school graduation rate is up. Ex - cept for marijuana and vaping, adolescent substance abuse is down. OTHER SOCIAL TRENDS that conservatives had condemned in the 1980s won wider acceptance. Homosexuality is today judged a nonproblem even by most Repub - licans, and a majority-Republican Supreme Court legalized gay mar - riage. Out-of-wedlock parentage is up, but it stabilized at around 44 percent starting in 1990, and anyway most Americans today have no objection to it. Marijuana is now legal in nearly half the states. To the extent conservatives still wage culture war on such issues, it is no longer with any pretension before he entered the White House that these programs were immensely popular. Instead, Reagan confined his entitlement cuts to poverty programs, which were much smaller and didn't have much of an orga - nized constituency to defend them. Unable to cut overall spending very much, Reagan nonetheless pressed ahead with deep tax cuts, with the result that the budget deficit nearly tripled on his watch. That put to rest fiscal conservatism except as a blatantly partisan tool to use against Democrats, who have had a significantly better record on lowering the deficit than Republicans. There are still tax cuts and deregu - lation, of course. If Republicans can be said to have any remaining principles, it's probably those. But the advent of the anti- woke-corporate GOP wing complicates such blatantly pro-business advocacy. No one is ever going to believe the GOP is challenging big business in any serious way so long as it continues to cut taxes and slash away at regulations (as it almost certainly will do). But while Republicans play for working-class votes, we hear less GOP rhetoric praising the awesome creative powers of entrepreneurs and job-creators, and more about corporations going soft on race, sexual orientation, and the environ- ment. Last December, a Republican staff report from the Senate Banking Committee accused the \"Big Three\" asset managers\u2014 BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard\u2014of using investors' money to advance diversity hiring and better environmental stew - ardship. These, the Republican staffers complained, were \"political movements unmoored from financial performance\" and therefore intolerable. New Right conservatism was premised to a great extent on the idea that the social fabric was torn to pieces by the tumultuous 1960s. But over time, this argument grew ever more difficult to make. Take crime. In a 1981 speech Reagan declared that a \"thin blue line\" (that, is, police) \"holds back a jungle which threatens to reclaim this clearing we call civilization.\" The backdrop to this racially charged remark was a crime rate that had been rising since the '60s. Reagan lengthened prison sentences and introduced preventive detention. Dem - ocrats didn't dare push back very hard, because their constituents were unhappy about crime, too. But the national crime rate peaked in 1991 and then started dropping precip - itously (for reasons that are still debated). European Parliament that condemned the 1939 Hitler-Stalin pact and \"efforts of the cur- rent Russian leadership\" to \"whitewash crimes committed by the Soviet totalitarian regime.\" Two months later, Simes argued \"the case for trump ,\" who showed, Simes wrote, \"unusual courage\" and \"persever - ance\" while he was \"subjected to the moral equivalent of daily waterboarding.\" Simes retired at the end of last year, allowing the journal finally to shed its em - barrassing associations with Putin and Trump. But he left behind yearly losses of $1 million to $2 million in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2020, Politico reported, and a journal staff that had dwindled from 20 to about four. In January, The National Interest shut down its print edition to focus on the web. The GOP Cold War consensus that Russia was an \"Evil Empire\" was defunct even as Putin sought savagely to justify it. Hawkish conservatives were able for a while to transfer Cold War fervor from Russia to the Middle East, and the 9/11 attacks gave them the political opportunity to wage war against Saddam Hussein in Iraq. But the rationale for that war vanished when it was discovered Iraq didn't possess biological and chemical weapons. The war dragged on for eight unpopular years, and in 2018 a withering Army study concluded that \"an emboldened and expansionist Iran appears to be the only victor.\" When Trump ran for president in 2016, he claimed (falsely) to have opposed the war from the start. Today, there is no Republican con - sensus about who America's enemies are, much less where we should draw a line with them. It's a far cry from Reagan at the Brandenburg Gate thundering, \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\" ON THE DOMESTIC front, Reagan quickly discovered there was little public support for cutting govern - ment spending in any meaningful way. \"People don't elect Repub - licans to repeal the New Deal,\" Representative Jack Kemp, a lead- ing ideological figure on the right, conceded in 1985. The bulk of gov- ernment spending was on defense and in the two biggest entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare. Reagan had no appetite for defense cuts, and although he'd once scorned Medicare as \"the soup kitchen of compulsory insur - ance\" and proposed that Social Security be made voluntary, he recognized even 37 Features March 2023 36In the 1994 second edition of his Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, William Bennett wrote that \"the forces of social decomposition\" seemed \"impervious to government spending.\" But within a few years Bennett gave up the project, because too many indicators were improving (to add insult to injury, under a Democratic president!) Mitt Romney had in 2012, and more still four years later. Even so, Trump's signa - ture immigration policy as president\u2014the separation of children from their parents at the border\u2014was wildly unpopular. Republican politicians have concluded that their best course is to agitate against immigration while steering clear of any proposed practical solutions, especially within the legislative sphere. JANUARY'S House floor fight over whether McCarthy would be made speaker was the culmination of Republicans' nihilistic drift. Out of habit, some news accounts labeled McCarthy's opposition a right flank, but the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page observed that \"the dissenters don't have major policy differences with Mr. McCarthy.\" Newt Gingrich, whose ascent to the House speakership in the late 1980s and early 1990s set that era's standard for Republican opportunism, rejected during the McCarthy balloting marathon any comparison with his own rise to power. \"We weren't just grandstanders,\" he told The New York Times ' Robert Draper. \"We were purposeful.\" Of the new crowd, Gingrich said, \"Anything that takes longer than waiting for their cappuccino, I doubt they're interested in.\" But the end of GOP ideology didn't start with Matt Gaetz any more than it start- ed with Newt Gingrich. It began with the real world's refusal, starting in the 1980s, to conform to the heady ideas that Pat Moyni - han praised Republicans for generating. Republican ideology had its moment. Then it reverted to the irritable mental ges - tures that Lionel Trilling observed in 1950. The only surprise is that it took four long decades to hit rock bottom. Timothy Noah is a staff writer at The New Republic.defend the decision; the bulk of the memo was about how to use Democrats' opposi - tion to the decision to make them seem extremist. Dobbs did more to limit Repub - lican gains in the midterms than any other issue; in exit polls, voters cited abortion second only to inflation as the most im- portant issue, and since then inflation has been receding. More than one-third of Republicans want abortion to be legal. The Republicans' biggest policy victory in decades is their biggest political problem. True, Republicans found a new cul - ture-war target in illegal immigration. Immigration was a nonissue under Rea - gan, who signed a major (and pretty liberal) immigration reform bill in 1986 and boasted in 1989 that \"anyone, from any corner of the Earth, can come to live in America and become an American.\" But President George W. Bush foundered with his own Republican Party when he tried to pass an immigration reform bill in 2007, and under Trump it became an absolute b\u00eate noire. Here, too, the em - phasis is less on articulating a coherent GOP policy than on accusing Democrats of favoring \"open borders.\" That's because the political benefit of advocating specific im- migration restrictions is a mirage, with GOP legislators ever fearful they'll be ac - cused of supporting \"amnesty\" if they favor anything short of mass incarceration for undocumented immigrants. As recently as 2013, a post-election autopsy by the RNC despaired that \"if His - panics think we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies.... We must embrace and champion compre - hensive immigration reform.\" That didn't happen, because the GOP was deadlocked on the issue. Then Trump ran an anti- immigration campaign in 2016 in which he made anti-Latino and anti-Muslim slurs that even fellow Republicans condemned\u2014 yet somehow won more Latino votes than to being a \"silent\" or \"moral\" majority. Rather, their posture has become that of an aggrieved minority. Where once they argued \"homosexuality is wrong,\" today they argue \"do not trample the rights of those few who judge homosexuality wrong on religious grounds.\" A funhouse-mirror pluralism has become the refuge of bigots and reactionaries. \"The ideas that once defined the Re - publican Party have become unpopular,\" Geoffrey Kabaservice, a historian of the GOP who's vice president of political stud - ies at the nonprofit Niskanen Center, told me. \"I think there's a general sense in the Republican Party that those ideas are un - popular so they can't be advanced openly.\" The only part of conservatives' social agenda from the 1980s that prevailed is the new legal sanction extended to all state bans or restrictions on abortion. But con - servatism's long-sought legal victory last year in Dobbs v. Jackson Women' s Health Organization made anti-abortion Repub - licans less inclined to address the topic rather than more. That's because abortion bans are now no mere hypothetical, but a brutal reality in at least 13 states. The public isn't pleased. Fully 62 percent of registered voters, according to a September New York Times poll, thought abortion should be \"always\" or \"mostly\" legal, and 52 percent said they \"strongly oppose\" the Dobbs decision. Overnight, intensity of feeling about the issue migrated from the antis to the pros. After an early draft of Dobbs leaked in May 2022, the National Republican Sena - torial Committee sent out a memo advising candidates on the issue. The first talking point was: \"Abortion should be avoided as much as possible.\" The nrsc meant the medical procedure, but that could just as easily have been advice on whether to address the topic. Almost none of what followed advised candidates on how to Republicans are royally pissed off about asset management firms with social and environmental commitments. Their targets really only care about the bottom line. In this new climate fight, we all lose.By Kate Aronoff Illustration by Gustavo Magalh\u00e3esThe Ri ght Has It In for \"Woke\" Investors. The Only Proble m? They Don't Exist.41 Features March 2023 40The Texas state Senate State Affairs Committee was considering neither alternative protein sources nor land use. Birdwell and his colleagues were gathered at the Old Harrison County Courthouse to determine whether the asset managers they'd summoned before them\u2014gargantuan companies charged with profitably investing trillions of dollars on behalf of their clients, including the state of Texas\u2014were complying with the demands of a bizarre new law. Passed in 2021, Senate Bill 13 requires Texas to cut off business ties to financial firms deemed to be boycotting energy companies for ideological reasons. The law was just one front in a proxy battle between the Republican Party and three letters newly in its crosshairs: ESG. The acronym, which stands for \"environmental, social, gov- ernance,\" refers to criteria investors use to determine the impact potential investments may have on the world, as well as calculate how events in the world may affect investments. It can describe financial products crafted to perform well according to those crite - ria, or strategies corporations adopt to do so. While its meaning is nothing if not fuzzy, the term is often shorthand for climate- and socially conscious investment. Crucially, its emptiness has made it an easy vessel for actors across the political spectrum to fill with meaning. For companies marketing themselves as sustainable, ESG is the means by which the private sector makes the world a better place. For the right, ESG is a new form of wokery, a way of weaponizing other people's money to coerce corporations to abide by a PC agenda. Not only does so-called woke investing prioritize ideological concerns over returns, conservatives argue, but it threatens to enforce changes far too radical for Congress. What had set the senators off\u2014rousing them from a post-lunch slump\u2014was a seemingly uncontroversial statement from Dalia Blass, the head of external affairs for BlackRock, which manages a cool $8.5 trillion in assets and has been heavily associated with ESG. Blass had been dispatched to this remote corner of East Texas to endure nearly a full day of grilling, handed the unfortunate task of subbing in for her boss, CEO and right-wing bogeyman Larry Fink. Given his company's enormous economic and political in - fluence, Fink\u2014a Democrat\u2014has become an easy punching bag for those already prone to arguing that a shadowy cabal of globalist elites is pulling the strings of global governance. Blass was here to absorb a few of the blows. Allegedly, BlackRock wanted to destroy a nearby coal plant. Pressed by committee Chair Bryan Hughes on her employer's plans, Blass reminded the senators that her company has $170 billion invested in U.S.-based public energy firms and no intention of divesting from them. She reiterated a talking point repeated by her bosses and just about every major fossil-fuel company on Earth (a list that includes donors to most of the politicians glaring at her). \"Respectfully, senator, this is about managing carbon emissions, not shutting down plants.\" Senator Bob Hall was incredulous. \"You told us earlier that your objective was to maximize investments,\" he barked. \"Now you're telling us that your objective is zero carbon emissions. Which is it?\" Senator Lois Kolkhorst\u2014who had begun her remarks more genially, cracking a joke about college football in the twang of a fun aunt\u2014framed the issue in apocalyptic terms: \"It is my job to let every one of my constituents live the American dream, and I view ESG as doing nothing but marginalizing this country that I have been so blessed to have been born into.\" Over the last two years, deep-pocketed Republicans have en- couraged state policymakers to leverage such arguments against everything from banking contracts to new regulations and Demo - cratic appointments. As those fights go national, they might yet eke out a Supreme Court victory that kneecaps the administrative state. Nevertheless, talk of eating bugs aside, the senators assembled in Marshall had stumbled on to the truth: Getting emissions down to zero will require that companies shut down fossil-fuel infra - structure. The problem is that neither of the main combatants in this culture war is especially interested in doing that. THE FIGHT AGAINST ESG extends far beyond Texas. Around the country, numerous states are penalizing banks and asset managers for paying insufficient deference to fossil-fuel companies. So far, five states\u2014starting with Texas\u2014have passed bills t o target entities deemed to be boycotting energy companies, and Republicans in more than a dozen legis - latures have passed or introduced legislation to otherwise restrict ESG. As the 2023 legislative sessions kick off, additional bills are being introduced by the day. Elected treasurers or comptrollers in Texas, West Virginia, and Kentucky accordingly released blacklists of financial firms they say are engaged in boycotts, calling on them to prove otherwise or lose contracts. Louisiana, Arkansas, South Carolina, Arizona, West Virginia, and Florida have together announced withdrawals of more than $4 billion from BlackRock.

Like most of his colleagues, he was gray-haired, drab-suited, ill-humored. Filtering in through a row of tall windows at Birdwell's back, the December light did little to brighten the atmosphere. \"Maybe that's why we're gonna be eating insects instead, cause there's nowhere for the cattle to graze.\"41 Features March 2023 40Building on these legislative successes, Republicans have vowed to use their newfound control of the House to force ESG-friendly asset managers to answer for their alleged crimes, not least with hearings like the one in Marshall. Their other plans are grander, and may result in dramatic changes to the administrative state. In July, Patrick Morrisey, the West Virginia attorney general, rallied his counterparts in more than 20 other states\u2014all members of the anti-ESG broad front\u2014to argue that a proposed climate disclosure rule from the Securities and Exchange Commission violates major questions doctrine, which holds that federal agencies have a limited ability to interpret and act on congressional statutes. That case, likely to make its way to the Supreme Court, could indefinitely hamstring the government's ability to function. Undergirding the anti-ESG movement is a familiar network of right-wing think tanks receiving hearty backing from some of the same donors that supported an earlier generation of self- described climate skeptics. One leading player is the Texas Public Policy Foundation, which was instrumental in passing that state's anti-boycott bill. In 2021, former Texas state Representative Jason Isaac, who leads the organization's anti-ESG work, unsuccessfully pushed the American Legislative Exchange Council (the ostensibly nonpartisan group of state legislators known for blanketing state Capitols with near-identical bills to advance right-wing priorities) to adopt a copy of Texas's law as official model legislation, the \"Energy Discrimination Elimination Act.\" Isaac tried again last year, this time with a revamped measure drafted by \"a coalition of folks\" that included an alec staffer; Trump's failed nominee for labor secretary, Andy Puzder; and Derek Kreifels, the CEO of the State Financial Officers Foundation, whose nonprofit network of state treasurers and comptrollers has served as a central coordinating hub for anti-ESG efforts. The re - sulting \"Eliminate Economic Boycotts Act\" bars companies with more than 10 full-time employees that want to do business with a given state from taking \"social, political, or ideological interests\" into account when investing. To coordinate messaging among treasurers and comptrollers, sfof has contracted with CRC Advisors, a for-profit PR shop part-owned by right-wing legal crusader and Federalist Society guru Leonard Leo. Legal entrepreneurs and ESG opponents have found common cause elsewhere, too. The Center for Media and Democracy\u2014a watchdog group that has tracked state-level anti-ESG efforts since their inception\u2014confirmed in January that the Republican Attorneys General Association's Rule of Law Defense Fund, which was active in rallying Trump supporters to the Capitol on January 6, 2021, now has an \"ESG Working Group.\" The money for the fight against ESG is coming from familiar sources. One of the largest sponsors of the State Financial Offi - cers Foundation is Consumers' Research, a 501(c)3 that between 2013 and 2019 received $4 million from DonorsTrust and Donors Capital Fund, dark-money groups that have funneled money from anonymous donors on to outfits pushing\u2014among other conservative fixations\u2014climate denial. DonorsTrust's 2021 tax returns show a number of other generous gifts to groups attack - ing ESG: $191,600 to alec; $493,000 to the Texas Public Policy Foundation; $934,500 to the Heartland Institute; and $360,000 for the Heritage Foundation. Like the older-school climate denial it's replaced\u2014advanced by a dwindling network of old men who insist simultaneously that the earth is not warming and that climate change is good, actually\u2014the jumble of anti-ESG talking points spreading through state capitals, right-wing think tanks, and congressional offices is an incoherent mess. The supposedly too-woke BlackRock has $107 billion invested in Texas-based energy companies alone, up from $91 billion in February 2022. At the hearing in Marshall, when Senate State Affairs Committee Chair Bryan Hughes was reminded of BlackRock's sizable fossil-fuel investments, he coun - tered confoundingly that the problem is that BlackRock has not divested. After BlackRock's Dalia Blass noted her company's $27 billion investment in ExxonMobil, Hughes responded gravely. \"That's our concern, we wish you weren't there,\" he said, then clarified: \"We wish BlackRock didn't have such a big stake in Exxon to push them around, bully them, and vote against oil and gas exploration.\" Hughes argues that asset managers' undue influence is ex - ercised through proxy votes, the decisions shareholders make about corporate strategy and management at companies' annual general meetings. Yet Hegar, the Texas comptroller, did not even consider proxy voting behavior when drafting up his list of the 10 banks and asset managers banned from state contracts for boycotting energy companies. THE RIGHT'S SUCCESS in dragging ESG into the culture wars is owed in large part to the confusion about what those letters actually mean. Even the corporate staffers and Wall Street types most likely to know what ESG stands for (again: environmen - tal, social, governance) don't share a common definition; three-quarters of institutional investors admit to being unclear. It does not, after all, make intuitive sense to refer to a jumble of adjectives as a noun\u2014let alone a tidily nefarious approach to investing. As legal scholar Elizabeth Pollman notes in her genealogy of ESG, the concept emerged out of the defeat of left-leaning plans in developing countries to rein in transnational corporations. Through the era of decolonization, nations freeing themselves from colonialism looked to build economic independence by constraining corporations that had long functioned as official or unofficial outgrowths of the old colonial powers; a key aim was to assert sovereignty over natural resources within their borders that had made fortunes for executives abroad. That push came to a head in the 1970s, only to be snuffed out by the early 1980s. Gradually, the United Nations adopted a more corporate-friendly orientation, pursuing public-private partnerships in line with the neoliberal zeitgeist. In 2000, it launched the Global Compact, a collaboration with the financial sector wherein companies signed on to an initial set of nine nonbinding principles on human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. In an influential 2004 report dubbed \"Who Cares Wins,\" the Global Compact coined the phrase ESG as a strategic rebranding of those priorities, calling for \"better inclusion of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors in investment deci - sions.\" The explicit goal, it must be emphasized, was to maximize profits. Companies that scored well on ESG metrics, the report stated, could \"increase shareholder value by better managing risks related to emerging ESG issues, by anticipating regulatory changes or consumer trends, and by accessing new markets or reducing costs.\"43 Features March 2023 42short-term returns. Hotly anticipated every year by the business press, the letters lay out Fink's investment approach and perspective as the head of a company whose now trillions of dollars' worth of shares\u2014spanning the whole economy\u2014offer a purportedly more enlightened view than that of the provincial corporate manager. \"To prosper over time,\" Fink wrote in his inaugural 2018 letter, \"every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.\" His 2020 letter called climate change \"a defining factor in companies' long-term prospects\" and pledged to hold them accountable. BlackRock, he added, \"will be increasingly disposed to vote against management and board directors when companies are not making sufficient progress on sustainability-related disclosures.\" Tariq Fancy joined the company to help it in that high-minded mission, coming on as BlackRock's chief investment officer of sustainable investing in 2018. Affable and photogenic, with more than a few choice catchphrases at the ready, Fancy had previously left a private equity job doing \"vulture investing\" in emerging markets to found an educational technology nonprofit. A little less than two years after his arrival at BlackRock, Fancy, who is now 44, left to attend to family matters. Since that time, he's emerged as a high-profile critic of ESG, making the rounds as a speaker and commentator on sustainable investment while splitting time between New York and his hometown of Toronto. In a widely circulated Medium essay about working at the asset manager, Fancy\u2014who speaks with a slight Canadian accent\u2014 describes flying back from a conference on a private jet with two colleagues working on iShares, BlackRock's massively prof - itable line of low-fee exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. When discussing how precisely the team's recently launched low-carbon ETFs would contribute to fighting climate change, one colleague was exasperated. \"All they need to know is that it has a lower carbon footprint!\" Fancy recalls her saying. After leaving BlackRock, Fancy thought of its sustainable invest - ment business as irrelevant to fighting climate change but pretty harmless. Mostly, he told me, \"I didn't want to be a salesperson for ETFs.\" However, seeing how quickly the public and private sectors sprang into action around the pandemic, he started to see it as something worse. The speed with which industry leaders followed the advice of epidemiologists pointed up how slow they had been to listen to climate scientists. \"Green investing is actively harmful because it's influencing public opinion and lowering the likelihood of regulation,\" he argued. \"It's like giving wheatgrass juice to a cancer patient. It's being so hyped and over-marketed. There's clear evidence the patient is delaying chemo.\" According to Fancy, BlackRock does take the risk posed by cli - mate change seriously insofar as it impacts the company's bottom line. But no one seemed to notice that assessing climate risk \"isn't the same as fighting climate change,\" he said. \"We're trying to get our money out before it hits. There's no social impact created out of selling something to rich people to protect their portfolio.\" Given his former employer's shortcomings, he's been baffled to watch the rise of the movement skewering BlackRock for its supposedly radical environmentalism. The right argues that asset managers are placing their values above customer returns; Fancy dismisses the idea out of hand. \"They're not violating fiduciary duty because they can't,\" he told me. \"This is green paint on what they're already doing. And suddenly these guys appear from the right pretending this green paint is actually real.\"ESG, of course, still lacks a formal definition or comprehensive regulatory oversight. It might mean taking a hard-nosed look at whether a company is poised to take advantage of or suffer from emerging trends like electrification, offering a niche product, or making a wan declaration of do-goodery. On a short-lived podcast put out by the State Financial Officers Foundation, Gallantly Streaming , foundation CEO Derek Kreifels offered his own creative interpretation: \"BlackRock is the Death Star. The progressive ESG movement is the Evil Empire. President Biden could arguably be Darth Vader, and the emperor is Larry Fink.\" What can perhaps be agreed on is that a firm's embrace of ESG indicates a certain willingness to adjust to shifting cultural mores, regulations, and even physical environments in ways that clients and investors might find attractive. It is arguably good for Disney's bottom line to diversify its corporate leadership and, consequently, content offerings\u2014an action that would fall under governance, or \"G.\" For Ikea, fashioning pillowcases out of toxic materials in sweatshops is a bad look, even if it happens to be cheaper. As such, the company widely broadcasts its commitment against those practices, a strategy that might fall under the social (\"S\") umbrella. Hedge funds have a similar incentive to determine whether luxury beachfront properties they might want to snap up will stay above sea level for more than a decade. Generally understood to include assessments of climate risk, investments in decarboniza - tion and resilience, and the sustainable investment products banks and asset managers offer to retail and institutional customers, environmental, or \"E,\" is the broadest and most controversial adjective of the trio. ESG critics on the left\u2014by far the loudest historically\u2014fear such methods can lull policymakers and the public into a false sense of security that the private sector is independently taking care of the problems it causes and doesn't need stricter state oversight. That fear has been largely vindicated. REPUBLICANS' CLAIMS NOTWITHSTANDING, the banks and asset managers coming under fire from red states continue to invest prolifically in the fossil-fuel industry. In 2021, sixty banks worldwide poured $185.5 billion into the 100 most expansionary fossil-fuel companies. JPMorgan Chase\u2014targeted by both Kentucky and West Virginia for boy - cotting energy companies\u2014provides more funding to fossil fuels than any other bank on Earth. Between 2016 and 2021, it furnished no less than $382.4 billion to coal, oil, and gas compa - nies.

Just one of the asset managers the report analyzed has a policy restricting financing for new oil and gas development. Among signatories to the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero\u2014a n effort to corral financial institutions to act on climate\u2014 BlackRock is the largest investor in fossil-fuel expansion, with $23 billion in stock and bond holdings in coal developers. (BlackRock declined to be interviewed on the record for this story.) Despite its obvious commitment to fossil fuels, BlackRock in particular has heavily marketed itself as a climate champion. In 2018, Larry Fink began writing annual letters to CEOs and clients to extol the virtues of stakeholder capitalism and of looking beyond 43 Features March 2023 42BlackRock-managed shares entitle them to in corporate board - rooms rather than having the company vote on their behalf; State Street has launched a similar program. So long as there are interested customers, asset managers see little contradiction between making returns on fossil fuels and making returns on the still vaguely defined transition away from them. The company is perfectly happy to bring in clients interested in both ends. After all, as the United States and Europe compete over how many billions of dollars in annual subsidies they can offer to re - newable energy developers and electric vehicle manufacturers, there is a tremendous amount of money to be made by empha - sizing environmental concerns. By 2025, ESG assets are projected to become a $50 trillion market and account for a third of all assets under management worldwide, boosted by government support for green energy and technologies. Asset managers can take advantage of that green wave demand by offering novel ESG investment products. And through its growing real assets and private equity arms, BlackRock can also invest directly in energy and infrastructure projects now eligible for a suite of new incen- tives. The public sector will shoulder the risk of new green asset classes as the private sector reaps the reward; whether emissions decline as a result is, for asset managers, irrelevant. An irony of the Texas senators and other \"anti-ESG\" stalwarts claiming their fight is one in defense of the fossil-fuel industry is how enthusiastic fossil-fuel companies themselves are about ESG, often through watery, far-off \"net-zero\" commitments that rely on unproven technologies to swallow up excess carbon from a rebranded business as usual. Chevron\u2014a donor to Texas state Senators Kolkhorst and Hall\u2014proudly touts its ESG commitments, from biodiversity to human rights and cybersecurity. After the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, oil and gas executives, like Fink, raved about the opportunities new tax breaks presented for technologies such as carbon capture and storage and hydrogen. As states demonize banks and asset managers over their climate rhetoric, they could also be starving energy companies of invest - ment partners. In a letter to Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar, Matt Vining, CEO of the oil field services company Navigator Energy Services, urged him not to include BlackRock on the state's list of blacklisted companies. \"Contrary to recent headlines, BlackRock does not boycott the oil and gas industry,\" Vining wrote. He praised the company as \"an essential partner,\" noting its partnership on a carbon-capture pipeline system that could feasibly benefit from IRA tax breaks. The rhetorical strategy of the anti-ESG movement relies on taking years of green marketing at face value. As the right throws their own talking points back at them, BlackRock and its peers are being made to straddle between the customers who want them to pursue ESG goals and those broadcasting to millions of viewers that such goals are, as Elon Musk once tweeted, the \"Devil Incarnate.\" FEW HAVE PUSHED the line that ESG is the devil more loudly than Vivek Ramaswamy, who runs the asset management firm Strive, backed by the likes of Peter Thiel and the hedge fund Narya Capital. Rarely photographed without a well-tailored blazer and crisp, precisely unbuttoned white shirt, the former wunderkind biotech executive is the author of Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America' s Social Justice Scam . Ramaswamy has also What's more, specifically ESG-themed funds like those Fancy sold remain a small sliver of what the largest asset managers offer. The biggest moneymakers\u2014most of what state and municipal government clients buy\u2014are algorithmically managed passive index funds such as ETFs, pegged to established listings like the nasdaq . Thanks to their low management fees and investors' hunt for yields amid record-low interest rates, such funds have exploded in popularity in the years since the Great Recession. In 2009, BlackRock controlled $3.3 trillion. When Republicans rail against firms for enforcing ESG, they generally refer to companywide policies about analyzing and managing risks that climate change and an energy transition could pose to portfolios. They take aim, as well, at asset man - agers' membership in investor alliances like Climate Action 100+ and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. To oppo - nents, the Big Three asset managers' massive control of corporate shares\u2014BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard together own 20 percent of the average S&P 500-listed firm\u2014awards them outsize power to enforce the whims of supposedly nefarious global alliances. In contrast to the industry's more soaring messaging, any agenda invoked by asset managers in the boardroom is purely in service of profits. \"For the asset managers, these are just prod - ucts,\" said Benjamin Braun, a political scientist at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, Cologne, Germany. Their core business model is retail, not returns: They aim to bring in ever-more fee-paying customers. The performance of any individual com- pany or industry matters only if it poses a barrier to retaining and attracting clients. \"Asset managers first and foremost are for-profit businesses that try to manage as much money as possible for as little cost as possible,\" Braun said. \"Anything they have to do in terms of engagement or corporate governance is a cost because you need to hire people that do that.\" That ambivalence about engaging with corporate governance is part of what makes the GOP's campaign against ESG such a headache for major asset managers. In response, BlackRock has expanded its Voter Choice program. Index fund investors representing $1.8 billion can now opt to cast the votes their Larry Fink, founder and chief executive of the investment firm BlackRock, at his offices in New Y ork in 2016 DAMON WINTER/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX45 Features March 2023 44the idea, given that Ramaswamy had disclosed he was setting up Strive. \"My thought is we want to keep this meeting to education and not include someone who is actively recruiting investors for a fund,\" Ronda Stegmann, former executive director of the Missouri State Employees' Retirement System, wrote in an email. Howev - er, Ramaswamy did end up presenting. The day after, the board agreed to instruct BlackRock not to vote on its behalf, knowing the change would raise administrative costs. Less than a week after recruiting Ramaswamy to speak to the South Carolina Retirement System Investment Commission and the state's Republican leg - islative caucus, Curtis Loftis Jr., the treasurer of South Carolina, announced a $200 million divestment from BlackRock. States investing assets with Strive aren't the only potential revenue stream Ramaswamy could extract from the anti-ESG movement. He has also spoken with a number of state officials on proxy voting and shareholder engagement through Strive's recently announced advisory arm. That venture is pitched as an explicit alternative to allegedly woke proxy advisers like Institu - tional Shareholder Services, which was also called to the hearing in Marshall. Emails show that Strive was on the verge of inking its first contract with a state pension system\u2014the name of which was not mentioned\u2014last fall. Ramaswamy pitched a similar arrangement to North Dakota. Advisory materials circulated and written by Strive consul - tants suggest that pension boards exercise a preference for asset managers that sound a lot like Strive. On August 2, Ramaswamy sent Lucinda Mahoney, the former Alaska revenue commissioner and a member of sfof , a list of best practices for state pension boards, drafted \"by a legal academic, in conjunction with our team, who also works as a consultant for Strive.\" The document recommends terminating pension board contracts with \"pro- ESG\" asset managers that cannot prove their practices \"lead to financially superior returns,\" and further counsels pension funds to exercise a preference for asset managers \"found not to have pro-ESG voting and corporate engagement policies.\" Just over a week later, Strive launched its inaugural fund, drll . (They now offer seven other ETFs.) Mahoney emailed Ramaswamy her good wishes: \"Congratulations!!!! Well done!\" ACCORDING TO A promotional video starring Ramaswamy, drll 's big idea is to use investors' power as shareholders to fight back against the Big Three asset managers allegedly telling U.S. energy companies \"to produce less oil and to frack for less natural gas.\" drll will instead mandate them \"to drill more, to frack more, to do whatever allows them to be more profitable over the long run without worrying about these toxic political agendas in the boardroom.\" Strive's sales pitch for the fund lists boosting energy exploration and production as a top goal. By buying drll , Ramaswamy said, you can \"join the movement.\" Fancy doesn't see much daylight between what BlackRock and Strive are doing: In essence, both are signaling different virtues to different customer bases. \"Strive Capital in particular is realizing that ESG products are a price-segmentation strategy for progressives,\" he told me. \"They could agree with me and say it's all marketing and none of it needs to exist and there are other ways to solve that problem. But that's the last thing they want. written prolifically on ESG and topics popular on the conservative- speaker and talk-show circuit, from big tech censorship to victimhood. He made sure to inform me of that fact a few minutes after we hopped on the phone. \"Read basically every op-ed I've written in The Wall Street Journal this year,\" he advised. \"I think it will bring you up to speed on this entire subject pretty quickly.\" Ramaswamy defines ESG as the \"use of nonpecuniary factors to guide investment decisions, investment oversight practices, and investment manager selection\"\u2014in other words, the practice of making decisions about investments for purposes other than generating the best returns, which he views as a dangerously anti-democratic distraction from corporations' true purpose of maximizing shareholder value. Sure, liberal fund managers are free to do what they want with their money\u2014\"that's part of what it means to live in a free country and a free economy,\" he said. \"The problem is when large financial institutions are using other people's money to advance considerations that they did not con - sent to.\" Ramaswamy's solution is to encourage \"transparency, disclosure, and consent\" from capital owners (e.g., pensioners whose funds asset managers invest). He also suggests using all available tools to hold financial institutions to the sole interest rule, the fiduciary law establishing that trustees must consider only the interests of their clients. \"Ask any everyday American who has money invested in the market: Do you want your money to be used to vote in favor of a racial equity audit?... I think most Americans,\" he contended, \"will give you a clear answer: Hell no!\" (Sixty-three percent of Americans, however\u2014and 70 percent of Republicans\u2014think the government should not set limits on corporate ESG investments.) Ramaswamy, who has keynoted confabs for the Heritage Foundation and the State Financial Officers Foundation, pushed back on the notion that there was any anti-ESG movement at all. While ESG was \"one of the most powerful movements in capital markets over the last decade,\" he described the recent pushback against it as a \"smattering of arguments\" \"heavily in - fluenced\" by his book. Emails obtained through diligent public information requests by the watchdog group Documented show a small, well-funded network of conservative actors\u2014including Ramaswamy\u2014coordinating to enlist state fiduciaries and pen - sion funds against ESG. He and Strive employees have spoken with elected fiduciaries and pension board decision-makers in Missouri, Alaska, South Carolina, West Virginia, North Dakota, and Utah, and attended strategy meetings with organizations working to advance anti-ESG measures. In some cases, they talked about investment opportunities; Ramaswamy appeared to be trying to drum up business for Strive from politicians advised to divest from BlackRock and its peers. When we spoke on the phone, Ramaswamy said Strive was actively seeking out new pension fund clients, trying to compete with BlackRock and \"go after the same distribution channels.\" (Strive was once code-named \"WhiteStone.\") In a follow-up email, he noted that none of the states whose officials he had spoken with had invested assets into Strive products. \"Strive's clients have come mainly through retail channels,\" he said. State officials have raised concerns about the ethics of taking advice from someone with a financial interest in their decision- making. In discussing whether to invite Ramaswamy to speak to an educational meeting for its board in June, staff at the Missouri State Employees' Retirement System appeared to caution against 45 Features March 2023 44principles. It was unacceptable to the banking industry, he wrote in a comment, that wvba members could be punished for any perceived slight against a company: \"Banks are being put in the onerous position of having to justify every decision they make in this regard\" to the West Virginia State Treasurer's Office. Allen noted, as well, that the draft contained no provision that grants a listed financial institution the right to know what evidence exists for a boycott, \"leaving the adversely affected bank defending against unknown, unsubstantiated information provided by unknown sources.\" While it agreed not to publicly oppose the bill, the West Vir- ginia Bankers Association sent a strongly worded letter to Moore expressing its frustration: \"One key point upon which all banks agree is that the logic of this type of legislation is inherently and deeply flawed. Our banks must not be used as pawns to im - pose political strictures upon the free market regardless of the ideology behind it.\" If the right's crusade against ESG reflects a flexible relation - ship to free-market principles, it has a downright hostile attitude toward democracy. Increasingly, the right's more authoritarian tendencies are unmoored from arms of capital traditionally friendly to right-wing causes. Where ideological libertarians look to build momentum for a Supreme Court challenge to the admin - istrative state, corporate managers want to fight back against the asset managers calling ever-more shots. Fossil-fuel companies, meanwhile\u2014especially smaller firms finding it harder to cash in on either decarbonization or surging gas prices\u2014are struggling to maintain a twentieth-century business model. All that desper - ation and anger is fertile ground for wealthy and ideologically hard-line donors and activists with millions to spare on enlisting new recruits in old fights. BlackRock is an easy punching bag, of course. And a handful of asset managers' outsize power to shape corporate policy is troubling for reasons that have nothing to do with some imagined woke agenda. As politicians increasingly lean on the private sector to deliver climate solutions, Wall Street's one and only priority is still to turn a profit. Absent robust public investment of the sort that now seems unlikely in the United States, ceding planning decisions for an energy transition to banks and asset managers means that projects that aren't profitable simply won't get fund - ed. Still, the world envisioned by Texas-style anti-boycott bills is nightmarishly authoritarian: where offending a fossil-fuel compa - ny triggers government sanctions. If the center stage battle over climate policy in the United States becomes one fought between alec and asset managers, then democracy has already lost. Kate Aronoff is a staff writer at The New Republic and the author of Overheated: How Capitalism Broke the Planet\u2014and How We Fight Back.So they just start pretending the ESG thing is real.\" He likened Strive to Black Rifle Coffee, founded to serve \"people who love America.\" The roaster's trollish presence online and at gun clubs has endeared it to armed white supremacists. Yet if Black Rifle is presented as an alternative to the liberal scolds at Starbucks, Strive, given its modest $500 million in assets under management and relatively niche offerings, makes for an odd replacement for either ISS or a Big Three asset manager\u2014at least for the state pensions and fiduciaries Ramaswamy is talking to. The argument from Ramaswamy and his fellow travelers is that liberal states are pressuring asset managers to advance a climate-oriented agenda, when asset management, in their view, should be agenda-free. New York City and California, both of which have demanded firms set stronger climate targets, have \"pressured the BlackRocks of the world into using everyone else's money to also advance that same objective,\" Ramaswamy said. Of course, the anti-ESG cohort is advancing its own agenda with similar means: using states' market power to enforce companywide policy among monopolistic asset management firms. What is the difference? Do people whose states might invest their pensions with Strive have any way of learning about that or weighing in on its proxy voting and shareholder engagement practices? When I put these questions to him, Ramaswamy expressed some ambivalence about the anti-boycott bills he has publicly supported. \"We believe the right solution is more competition and disclosure in the market,\" he insisted. And with regard to Strive, he emphasized the need for transparency \"when there's a nonpecuniary investment,\" though he didn't clarify who would make the call on what counts as nonpecuniary. A throughline of anti-ESG activism is its single-minded com - mitment to fossil-fuel production that in some cases reaches well beyond what companies actually seem to want, even as the American Petroleum Institute provides backing. At the North American Gas Forum in Washington, D.C., this fall, an oil executive\u2014speaking on the condition of anonymity\u2014was weary of the push. \"Those are still fundamentally decisions that need to be driven by the businesses,\" he said. If parts of the fossil-fuel industry seem uneasy or ambivalent about the anti-ESG crusade, parts of the financial sector are livid. Emails obtained by Documented show a tense back and forth be - tween West Virginia Treasurer Riley Moore's office and the West Virginia Bankers Association in the drafting process for SB 262, an anti-boycott bill modeled on the one passed in Texas. (Moore's office did not respond to multiple requests to comment on this story.) Provided a draft of the bill to mark up, the West Virginia Bankers Association general counsel and director of government rela - tions, Loren Allen, objected to the bill's intrusion on free-market So long as there are interested customers, BlackRock sees little contradiction between making returns on fossil fuels and making returns on the still vaguely defined transition away from them. March 2023 46Books & the Arts ILLUSTRATION BY ISRAEL G. VARGAS47 Books & the Arts CALIFORNIA CAN SEEM incoherent from top to bottom. From the south, there's San Diego, a militarized pleasure dome that has quite effectively obscured obscene inequal - ity with sunshine, sand, and SeaWorld. There's Los Angeles, a gorgeous paragon of health and wellness famous for its exhaust fumes and smog, the world's glorious enter - tainment capital where the most common thing to catch on TV is a news story about the rich and powerful caging as many poor people as they possibly can. There's the Central Valley, hundreds of miles of farms so fertile that they produce more than half of America's fruits and vegetables, resting atop a desert so perpetually drought-strick - en that its denizens have been pumping the state's groundwater dry just to keep up with demand. And then, of course, there's the Bay Area\u2014the coolest, queerest, most radical place in the country\u2014and also one rapidly being made unlivable by tech bros, their tough-on-crime allies, and all of the money spewed in their wake. There are other stops on that road trip, too, from Orange County and the country's most beautiful beaches to Death Valley, Mount Whitney, and the country's most extreme environments. But the most influ - ential spot on the map is a small, wealthy enclave called Palo Alto: the economic, cultural, and spiritual hub of Silicon Val- ley. Indeed, from the story of this small town one can extrapolate much of the recent history of the world. Or so argues the journalist Malcolm Harris in his recent book, Palo Alto: A History of California, Capitalism, and the World. It's in Palo Alto that the gospel of optimi - zation emerged alongside an unprecedented surveillance infrastructure, the dogma of meritocracy growing in parallel with the huge creation of wealth, power, and stress. At the heart of this history is what Har - ris recognizes as Silicon Valley's singular capitalist innovation: foregrounding the individual to forestall class struggle, con - vincing or compelling those individuals not only to work till they drop, but to feel they have no choice\u2014and, sometimes, to like it. So far, at least, Palo Alto has succeeded. Harris would know. He was, after all, raised in Palo Alto. And though he has long since come east, he retains a keen eye for the cultural and economic hallmarks and exports of his famous hometown. His first book, Kids These Days , tracked late capitalism's grinding effects on Harris's own generation. His latest, Palo Alto\u2014an encyclopedic account of the history and impact of the town\u2014feels like the culmi - nation of his upbringing and career. It's a stunning, Technicolor anvil of a book, starting before the founding of Stanford University and proceeding through the rise of the computer, the internet, sub - urbs, startups, and startup culture, ranging from wars of conquest to the Cold War to the war on terrorism to the tech industry's war on privacy. Palo Alto is far from the first history of the town, its residents, or its influence, but it is among the most capacious. Its strength lies in this very broadness, in the book's determination to cover art and crime and drugs and economics and eugenics and robots and attempt to tie it all together as the story of modernity. To make sense of California, of our world, we must turn to this shining city by the bay. WHEN HARRIS WAS in the fourth grade, a substitute teacher in the town's elementa - ry school\u2014Ohlone Elementary, named for the area's population\u2014told him and his classmates an unvarnished truth: \"You live in a bubble.\" The students, who lived in well-manicured if unassuming sub - urban homes, in this temperate, vaguely countercultural-seeming city, conveniently located near some of the richest compa - nies (and having one of the finest school systems) in the country, were confounded. For this indiscretion, the substitute was fired and blacklisted. But the moment stuck with Harris. It prompted him to question Palo Alto's own explanation for \"why things were the way they were\u2014why some peo - ple had big houses and others didn't, why some people lived here and everyone else didn't: They deserved it. Hard work and talent allowed some people to change the world single-handedly, and they earned whatever they got.\" The kids in Palo Alto were at the forefront of a generation raised online and on meritocracy, a cohort that simultaneously had more access to infor - mation than ever before but also less time to explore than any previous crop of kids. The myth really began to lose its luster a few years later, when a wave of suicides among Palo Alto High School students began. Hard work was supposed to lead to success. But Palo Alto's young were working so hard that many took their own lives. In a characteristically chilling insight, Harris notes that the railroad many of his class - mates used to kill themselves (stepping in front of the Caltrain) was also the railroad that brought a critical mass of Anglo set - tlers to California in the first place, setting the whole sick system in motion. The man who built that railroad was Leland Stanford\u2014a \"notably unexception - al\" figure Harris sees as a \"slacker\" who got very lucky. Born in Watervliet, New York, in 1824, young Stanford did as so many restless white men were doing in the The Palo Alto Problem From Stanford to Silicon Valley, how a small town in California spread the gospel of data and control By Scott W. Stern March 2023 48mid-nineteenth century: He went west looking for an easy fortune, helping to displace (that is, enslave, expel, murder) Indigenous communities in the name of \"improving\" land that the settlers called \"California.\" California was booming, and, within a decade of landing in the new ter - ritory, Stanford\u2014the dim front man for a quartet of ambitious merchants called \"the Associates\"\u2014became governor. Later, capitalizing on the prestige of his single, un - distinguished term in office, he became the president of a railroad line linking the re - source-rich West Coast to East Coast money. The railroads were built with federal lar - gesse (a grant to the railroad barons of an amount of land whose total size was larger than Maryland's) and exploited immigrant laborers. The result was an efficient system of transcontinental transportation, the cre - ation of fabulously wealthy corporations and a tiny elite that ran them, and so much worker resentment directed at the barons that Stanford chose to relocate from a San Francisco mansion to an agricultural area to the south that was renamed for the re - gion's tall trees: Palo Alto. In Palo Alto, Stanford came into his own and created a pseudo-feudal empire, at the heart of which was a horse farm. Not con - tent merely to own horses (even the fastest horses), \"Stanford the capitalist\" embarked on \"a serious scientific campaign regarding the improved performance of the labor - ing animal,\" viewing horses as biological machines that could be perfected, made ever faster. The result was not a stable of super-horses but \"a regimen of capitalist rationality\" and an \"exclusive focus on po - tential and speculative value\" that Harris calls the \"Palo Alto System.\" It is the Palo Alto System that the rest of the book tracks, the unholy marriage of data and control in service of ever-greater profits.STANFORD, AND ESPECIALLY his followers, were eager to put the Palo Alto System into practice, and they had just the place to do so: the university that the railroad baron had recently founded in his adopted home - town. Stanford University was established in 1885 to be a new type of school for new people in a newly colonized land, a train-ing ground for the children of California on what was then the largest university campus in the United States. The first students matriculated in 1891. Just two years later, Stanford was dead. The university's president\u2014the scientist David Starr Jordan\u2014may or may not have then poisoned Stanford's widow, Jane, in order to seize control. In any event, Stanford be - came Jordan's school, and he turned it into a \"home for high tech-research and devel - opment,\" a \"global headquarters of science\" where administrators used the \"science\" of eugenics to recruit students and facul - ty. As early as 1909, Jordan and the head of his civil engineering department gave a recent alum access to the school's high voltage laboratory, facilitating the creation of a long-range telegraphy company and ultimately making Stanford a hub for the burgeoning radio industry. Meanwhile, Jordan hired scholars like Lewis Terman, a social scientist who transformed primitive intelligence testing into a eugenic prac - tice meant to weed out the evolutionarily fit from the rest (a technique that soon informed Stanford's grading system). By the end of the Jordan era, Harris writes, the school excelled at producing both \"mining engineers\" and \"intelligence prospectors,\" investing in both young companies and young minds. Data and control in action. Most influential of the Stanford men\u2014 and, indeed, the closest thing Palo Alto has to a main character\u2014was the future U.S. President Herbert Hoover. One of the very first students to enroll at the college, Hoover was a middling scholar (he got zero A's) but proved to be an excellent ad - ministrator (setting up a laundry service on campus and quickly subcontracting to other students to maximize his income). After graduation, he worked as a mining manager in colonized regions of Australia and China, went on to serve as U.S. com - merce secretary, and ultimately became a catastrophic one-term president at the nadir of the Great Depression. Above all, Hoover was a zealous anti-communist. As a post-presidential roving public in - tellectual and political grandee, he threw himself projects like crushing unions (his California ranch was a site of significant labor unrest) and engineering post-World War II food aid to Germany to jump-start an economy friendly to powerful interests (he wanted workers \"to be fed\" but \"not too much\"). Among his most lasting legacies is the Hoover Institution, a reactionary think tank housed in a tower that looms\u2014 \"phallic,\" Harris notes\u2014over Stanford. During the Cold War, federal money flowed into Palo Alto, which grew rich mak - ing high-tech weapons and surveillance machinery. Stanford became an electronics laboratory and corporate landlord, with Lockheed Martin, Fairchild Semiconduc - tor, and Hewlett-Packard conveniently taking up residence near campus (and near all those burgeoning engineers). The computer emerged from Palo Alto-based innovations: the vacuum tube, the silicon transistor, and the tech startup. A white, patriarchal, and conservative suburban culture emerged, too: engineer fathers tak - ing the car to work to build missile systems, homemaker mothers carefully tending to single-family homes in restricted neighborhoods. Home prices skyrocket - ed. The wealth was built by (and on the Palo Alto: A History of California, Capitalism, and the World by Malcolm Harris Little, Brown, 720 pp., $36.00 The most influential spot on the map of California is a small, wealthy enclave called Palo Alto: the economic, cultural, and spiritual hub of Silicon Valley. 49 Books & the Arts backs of) subjugated Black migrants and Mexican and Asian immigrants, \"just the way Hoover and his associates planned it.\" Newcomers of color arriving in this rich corner of the Golden State were forced to find homes on the less desirable side of Highway 101, compete for dwindling agricultural jobs or nonunionized manu- facturing jobs, and often settle for janitorial or other service positions. At the same time, Palo Alto was expanding across the globe, with California companies like HP and Bank of America opening out - posts in places like B\u00f6blingen, Germany, and Tokyo, respectively\u2014two of the very sites the Allies had recently strategically bombed using Palo Alto tech. Elsewhere across the globe, colonized peoples were rising up, mirroring (and emerging in coor - dination with) resistance by marginalized peoples within the United States. The Black Panther Party\u2014\"the most important Amer - ican communist party since the Popular Front\"\u2014exploded out of the Bay Area in the late 1960s, and student radicals (even at Stanford) protested incipient computer technology. Militants occupied Stanford's Applied Electronics Lab for more than a week, bombed the Stanford Linear Accel - erator Center, and invaded the Stanford Research Institute in an attempt to destroy its data storage drums. The students believed, correctly, that the school's data processing research was integral to the U.S. war ma - chine (having been specifically tipped off that the Stanford Research Institute was modeling an offensive in Vietnam). Yet increasingly militarized police and tech - nologically sophisticated militaries quelled rebellion at home and abroad. Even as U.S. factories began fleeing off - shore in the 1960s and 1970s, \"Silicon Valley came into its own.\" While manufacturing flatlined, the tech industry soared. \"White working-class homeowners,\" Harris writes, \"began to identify as white and homeowners more than as members of the working class\"\u2014nowhere more so than in California, in Palo Alto most of all\u2014and they united to snuff out the remnants of the New Deal, electing leaders who deregulated industry and finance, privatized services, decimated unions, and delivered tax cuts. This move was not just political but cultural; Califor - nia's hippies turned classwide struggle into individualized, existential melodrama. Tripping and consciousness-raising sup - planted collective action. Uniting the political and the cultural with aplomb, California's business leaders picked an affable brand-ambassador for free-market capitalism and Golden State individualism: Ronald Reagan. Led by an auto dealership magnate named Holmes Tuttle, they encouraged Reagan to run for office and bought him national airtime to sing their gospel. His presidential ad - ministration (including several California industrialists and arms dealers) cut so - cial services to increase defense spending, funneled money and fancy Palo Alto tech (phone-intercept equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, etc.) to repressive local elites around the world, and helped turn edu - cation (previously an accessible incubator for all that pesky student radicalism) into a private market, leading students \"to think of themselves in the same terms, as a walk - ing, talking set of investments.\" The Palo Alto System was ascendant, as rich kids (like Bill Gates) and counter - cultural hustlers (like Steve Jobs) invested wisely and created not only companies but an accompanying mythology. The comput - er became personal, the internet became privatized, and coffee and cocaine both be - came fuels imported from abroad for Silicon Valley workers (in the startups and on the streets) to seek ever greater efficiency. New companies\u2014Cisco, Oracle, Sun Microsys - tems, Netscape, Amazon, Google\u2014burst forth and disrupted and extracted more and more, their innovations enabled by families of refugees living in basements in an increasingly unaffordable Bay Area, by workers laboring for pennies in highly surveilled factories across the global south. The bright young companies promised \"a new phase of postindustrial American ex - pansion,\" and regulators hastened to get out of the way. The bonds linking tech and the state only tightened after 9/11, when \"Sili - con Valley's self-styled anti-authoritarians\" saw exciting new moneymaking opportu - nities in supplying private data to public authorities bent on control. Mere months after the World Trade Center fell, Oracle had established a division to design and sell \"homeland security and disaster re - covery solutions,\" and even though CEO Larry Ellison did not succeed in winning a contract for a national biometric identifica - tion system, Oracle's revenue nonetheless doubled during the George W. Bush years. \"Palo Alto and Silicon Valley and Stan - ford and tech and the internet stood for more than the newest electronics,\" Har- ris writes. \"They stood for getting fucking rich.\" With hefty state contracts, low taxes, easy access to credit, and little meaningful regulation, Palo Alto's princelings could borrow and invest and attain monopolistic domination in record time, consequences be damned. AS THE BOOK gets closer and closer to the present, Harris acknowledges, it be - comes increasingly \"difficult to narrativize the latest phase of Silicon Valley history.\" The dot-com and housing bubbles burst, DREW ANGERER/GETTY From left: Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, and Sheryl Sandberg met with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and President-elect Donald Trump at a summit brokered by Peter Thiel in 2016. March 2023 50anger swelled in the streets, yet Palo Alto's capitalists just kept doubling down, aided and abetted and funded at every step by the supposed adults in the White House and on Wall Street. \"The process selected for and elevated certain kinds of people. This, frankly, is where the story gets dumb.\" In recent Silicon Valley history, the dumbest and most outlandish and most venal individuals have made out the best (at least for a while). Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani of Theranos, Travis Kalanick of Uber, Adam Neumann of WeWork\u2014these were people so lacking in creativity or ingenuity or even basic tech- nical expertise that they \"made Steve Jobs look like Steve Wozniak.\" And all this was before Elon Musk oopsied his way into buying Twitter and then promptly revealed himself to be such a stunningly incompe - tent manager that he effectively gutted one of the world's most important and popular communications platforms in a matter of weeks. Before the most celebrated crypto- exchange was revealed to be a massive Ponzi scheme run by a privileged polycule of twentysomethings. Donald Trump's success was the dumb - est of all, his 2016 run for the presidency lavished with support from such Silicon Valley power players as Bob and Re - bekah Mercer and Peter Thiel. For Thiel, a Stanford-educated tech entrepreneur and far-right culture warrior, Trump was a speculative bet that paid off handsome - ly. The new administration contracted with Thiel's data analysis firm, Palan - tir, to the tune of billions of dollars, and Thiel himself became the Trump White House's liaison to Silicon Valley. Short - ly after Trump's election, Thiel helped to engineer a much-publicized meeting between the new president and Silicon Valley's elite: Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Elon Musk, Larry Page, Sheryl Sandberg, Eric Schmidt, and a slew of other tech exec - utives. \"After this meeting, these firms grew willing and even eager to deal with the government directly,\" Harris recounts. \"Amazon, Google, and Microsoft pur - sued and won tens of billions in security contracts, edging into the territory of tra - ditional prime contractors.\" The Trump meeting was \"a culmination of the Palo Alto System,\" Harris concludes. This regional economy represented the world's highest concentration of capital, and now its leaders could claim their place \"at the center of the capitalist world,\" pledg - ing allegiance to data and control. The Palo Alto System has prevailed far beyond the corridors of power. The gospel of relentless optimization has encroached on every area of life. It's why homeowners and car owners rent out their abodes and their vehicles as part-time servants, why laborers in Amazon warehouses and over- burdened hospitals urinate in bottles rather than halting for even a minute, why writers and artists and academics without institu- tional homes have to tell themselves that just one more gig might lead to some stabil - ity. It's why one high school student in Palo Alto (where the suicide rate between 2003 and 2015 was three times the state average) could write, \"We are not teenagers. We are lifeless bodies in a system that breeds com - petition, hatred, and discourages teamwork and genuine learning.\" Today, individuals race to monetize their every moment, their bodies, their minds, their identities, until they can squeeze productivity out of every spare second, until they can never stop. HARRIS DOES NOT seek to close his big book with a wider solution or a cure. He calls for Stanford and Palo Alto to be dis - established, the plundered wealth and stolen land turned back over to the Ohlone. It's a compelling idea, one that (as Harris notes) Indigenous activists and scholars have been demanding for a long time. In fact, in the months since Harris sent his manuscript off to be printed, the city of Oakland has announced it would return land to the Ohlone\u2014but just five acres. As Harris acknowledges, it's unlikely the Stanford board of trustees will allow any broader reparations of land. In any case, as Harris makes clear, the Palo Alto System is much bigger than Palo Alto or even California. The regime of in-cessant investment and labor that Harris describes in fact is so dominant that it makes one wonder whether today's cul - ture can be directly traced to Palo Alto, or whether Palo Alto simply serves as a neat exemplar of that culture. If, as Harris writes in the epilogue, there \"is just capitalism, an impersonal system that acts through peo - ple toward the increasing accumulation of capital,\" then where exactly does the Palo Alto System enter the equation? And how distinct is the Palo Alto System from, say, what the historian Edward Baptist calls \"the 'whipping-machine' system,\" through which slaveholders literally beat consistent increases in productivity out of increasing numbers of enslaved Black people between 1800 and 1860? How distinct is it from the scientific management regimes long de - ployed by agents of imperialism, which sought to profit from and regulate native life to such an extent that\u2014as the scholar Warwick Anderson has described\u2014early- twentieth-century American agents even tried to dictate the manner in which Fil - ipinos defecated? How distinct, in other words, is the Palo Alto System from empire, from capitalism itself? Yet if Palo Alto is an imperfect frame for understanding a history as gargantu - an as the one that Harris recounts, Palo Alto nonetheless manages to tell a story that is grand in its scope, startling in its specifics, and ingenious in the connec - tions it draws. Ultimately, neither Cali - fornia nor the broader world is incoherent when viewed, clear-eyed, in the harsh light of history. By striving to extract profit at every conceivable opportunity, the pio - neers and innovators have condemned us all, and the places where we live, to a trudge toward collapse. Scott W.

Kagan's credibil- ity plummeted. \"Why would any rational person listen to Robert Kagan?\" Glenn Greenwald wondered in 2007. Kagan and his fellow neoconservatives, journalist James Fallows commented, \"have earned the right not to be listened to.\" By the late 2000s, the consensus was that neoconservatism, as the writer Jacob Heilbrunn observed, \"not only destroyed conservatism as a political force for years to come but also created an Iraq syndrome that tarnishes the idea of intervention for several decades.\" In fact, a new left and new right demanding military restraint reemerged from the blowback, carnage, and defeat to which Americans have seen their wars lead. The isolationist right roared into prominence thanks to Donald Trump's call to end \"Endless Wars\" and attempt to withdraw troops around the world. And, in- spired by peace candidate Bernie Sanders, the left gained a hearing for its critiques of liberal internationalism since 1989, with figures such as Trita Parsi and Stephen Wertheim launching initiatives for a pol- icy of restraint. And yet in this desperate pass, Kagan\u2014 the most sophisticated spokesman for the neoconservative foreign policy school\u2014 has gotten another hearing. In the last few years, Kagan has reconstructed himself as a defender of America's liberalism against threats within and without, and helped to reforge a centrist pact that approaches world affairs from the shimmering belief that the greatest armed power in history is the exceptional and indispensable force for global freedom. That belief had been tottering on the precipice; the Ukraine War restored its appeal overnight. F. Scott Fitzgerald was wrong: Neocon - servatives, at least, can get a second act in American life. Kagan's new history of U.S. foreign policy in the early twentieth century, The Ghost at the Feast , shows how he has repackaged his beliefs for an era of recently challenged but suddenly renewed optimism about America's exceptional role in world affairs. The book is a study of the years leading up to World War II\u2014a period that both liberals and neoconservatives like to use to prove that sometimes America's only responsible option is military inter - vention. Yet as Kagan proceeds through FROM THE DAYS of his earliest foreign policy salvos, launched from the neo- conservative mothership Commentary in the 1980s, Robert Kagan has held two core beliefs. First, though it is rare in hu - man affairs, and threatened on all sides, freedom is possible in a fallen world. Sec - ond, only the United States can provide that freedom by superintending the in - ternational system, and resorting when necessary\u2014distressingly often, it turns out\u2014to armed might. One principle is pleasingly universal, if melodramatic and selective about how much freedom its de - fenders have achieved and what the most serious threats to that freedom are. But the other principle, which Kagan presents as a necessary corollary, routinely corrupts the first with its aggrandizing nationalism and violent warmongering. After the Iraq War, Kagan and his fel - low neoconservatives earned the fury of American liberals for instigating one too many catastrophic foreign interventions on these principles. Kagan explained the mission in his Washington Post column on the very day of the September 11 at - tacks, calling on Congress to declare war on all enemies. \"It does not have to name a country,\" he suggested. (It didn't.) Within Interventionism, Rebooted Robert Kagan fell from favor after the disaster of the Iraq War. The war in Ukraine gave him another chance. By Samuel Moyn March 2023 52the years of rejection of U.S. warmongering before 1941, and the \"great debate\" about whether to intervene at all before Pearl Harbor, he inadvertently recognizes the power of the historic and recent alternatives to U.S. militarism. While he is regaining influence, his history can equally be read as cautioning against militarist lessons so often drawn from the past. KAGAN WAS BORN in 1958 in Athens. His father, Donald, a Lithuanian Jew who came to the United States as a toddler, was a scholar of ancient Greek history, and was in Greece with his wife on a fellowship that year. The elder Kagan joined the neo - conservative wave as a Cornell professor traumatized\u2014like Allan Bloom\u2014by the events of 1969, when a group of armed Black students occupied the student union. He decamped to Yale that year, where he was a renowned teacher until he passed away in 2021\u2014and where Robert Kagan, like his younger brother Frederick, went to college before entering the foreign policy intelli - gentsia. (Frederick achieved brief renown for convincing George W. Bush to surge U.S. forces in Iraq in hopes of snatching victory from the jaws of that defeat.) Robert was not a professional scholar, but a denizen of think tanks and writer for op-ed pages. He has spent his whole profes - sional life outside of academic circles as a foreign policy intellectual, first in govern - ment, where he served in the Department of State under Ronald Reagan, then in var - ious private outfits. (He is now employed by the Brookings Institution, and writes regularly for The Washington Post.) But he has always had some aspirations to be a chronicler of ethical precepts in a world of power\u2014much like his father, a histori- an of the Peloponnesian War whose works include a study of Thucydides. Kagan cultivated the reputation as a neoconservative \"hard-liner\" from the start, but made his biggest early splash in 1996, when he teamed up with fellow neoconservative scion William Kristol in Foreign Affairs , urging the Republican Par - ty not to concede to isolation or \"realism\" (neoconservatism's eternal bugbear) after winning the Cold War. Far from resting on its laurels, they wrote, the United States must assert \"benevolent hegemony.\" Ka-gan and Kristol cofounded the Project for a New American Century the next year, calling for the Republican Party to put \"American global leadership\" at the center of its foreign policy, and specifically recom - mending Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's removal. In the late 1990s, Kagan\u2014who soon became a contributing editor for this magazine\u2014forged ties with liberal hawks. Over the following decade, his credo pro - vided the rationale for George W. Bush's response to the September 11 attacks. In a Policy Review article in summer 2002, Kagan attacked Europeans for hesitating to join the war in Iraq. He did not trace their reluctance to the foreseeable effects of the crackpot scheme of attacking the country, or to Europe's own commitment to a liberal order with rules. Instead, he proposed, the United States had remained manly through its militarism, while Europeans had turned feminine and passive under the chivalrous guardianship of their American protector. \"On major strategic and international ques- tions today,\" Kagan wrote, \"Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus.\" No American foreign policy school has crashed from the heights of influence as hard and quickly as neoconservatism did in the mid-2000s, when American body bags and a failed occupation caused many voters to give Venus her due. By the time of Barack Obama's election in 2008, dire straits in Iraq seemed to spell the complete demise of neoconservatism. Like other in - terventionists, Kagan experienced these years as a gloomy time. He took it upon himself to regularly vilify the Democratic president for going soft on enemies like Syria. He expressed serious disappoint - ment with Obama's failure to stand up for the universal values only U.S. might could support: \"Superpowers don't get to retire,\" Kagan scolded. (Obama's reinvention of the war on terrorism did not reach Kagan's high bar for adequate forcefulness.) Then came the annus horribilis of 2016. In the primaries and the general election, presidential candidates in both parties sternly or strategically rejected core elements of liberal internationalism. \"Pol - iticians in both parties dangle before the public the vision of an America freed from the burdens of leadership,\" Kagan com - plained. Trump went as far as to indict the Iraqi blunder\u2014which many Republicans such as Jeb Bush had up to that point been loath to do\u2014and came out against such fixtures of liberal internationalism as free trade and military alliances. Most disturb - ingly, he implied that there was nothing for the United States to defend other than its own interests. To Kagan's consternation, even Hillary Clinton distanced herself from neoliberal trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Situated uneasily between conserva- tive and liberal parties, Kagan understood that neoconservative elites had lost influ - ence in their home, the Republican Party. Some charter members of the school of neoconservative foreign policy made the risky choice to ride the tiger. Kagan's for - mer State Department boss, Elliott Abrams, for example, became special representa - tive for Iran and Venezuela under Trump. But Kagan never stooped to trying to steer Trumpism toward more neoconservative outcomes. Instead, he moved from influ - ence on the right and tactical alliance with liberals to presenting himself as a spokes - man for liberalism itself. Few argued as strongly as Kagan did that being against Trump meant defending something called \"the liberal order.\" As a New York Times profile noted as early as 2014, Kagan was always looking for a \"climate to again make the case for interventionism.\" He began taking \"con - siderable pains\" to describe his \"advocacy as uniting interven - tionists of center-left and center-right in a common front, which included teaming up with Antony Blinken, Joe Biden's fu - ture secretary of state, to reclaim the U.S. mission. The next president, they wrote in 2019, would have \"a hard time bucking a F. Scott Fitzgerald was wrong: Neoconservatives, at least, can get a second act in American life. 53 Books & the Arts trend that preceded Trump and will likely survive him,\" but both Democrats and Re - publicans must agree not to overlearn from \"past mistakes\" and cancel a commitment to U.S. leadership. If the beleaguered cen - ter across party lines did not stand up for freedom in a dangerous world, who would? With or without new liberal friends, Ka - gan attacked Trump before and since his presidency not as a symptom of endless war and national decline, but as an ob - struction to reinstating interventionism. For Kagan, it was never the consequences of war that have made it unpopular, but the apathy, indolence, and irresponsibility of Americans who abdicate their appointed role. Never one to reflect on his own invet - erate nationalism, Kagan mourned that somehow \"America first\" had now \"won\" in both parties. KAGAN'S PRINCIPLES ALSO drive his histories, though less frontally. His first book, published in 1996, was a detailed and near-1,000-page defense of Ameri - ca's bloody late Cold War malfeasance in Nicaragua. Kagan had helped formulate policies on Latin America when he worked in government. As an early reviewer not - ed, while he embraced neoconservative conclusions about the necessity and no - bility of those policies, Kagan aspired stylistically to \"the role of dispassionate historian.\" From the first, his history books cultivated a Thucydidean detachment, disguising their fervent moralism in cool prose. The same posture\u2014as if he were writing for the ages\u2014marks what Kagan is now styling his \"trilogy\" on the history of U.S. foreign policy, of which his new book is the centerpiece. The first volume of that trilogy, Dan- gerous Nation: America's Foreign Policy From Its Earliest Days to the Dawn of the Twentieth Century (2006), concluded that America's reputation for isolationism was a myth. The first country founded on the Enlightenment idea of the liberty and equality of all human beings, the Unit - ed States angled from the start to spread freedom by amassing power. He describes the U.S. invasion of Cuba in 1898, for ex - ample, as essentially a principled act. He denies that the United States was motivat - ed by economic interests, and emphasizes instead the atrocities of Spanish rule of the island and future President Theodore Roosevelt's empathy for aspirations for democratic regime change. It was just one of many dry runs for Iraq, you see, in which U.S. imperialism and press sensationalism played no role. Far from being a recent deviation, the United States was from the outset a \"neocon nation.\" The Ghost at the Feast tells the story of how the United States nonetheless dith-ered for a while in embracing its destiny of globalizing freedom in a world of its enemies. Yes, Kagan acknowledges, the United States started to spread freedom, not only in Cuba but also in the Philippines, won in the Spanish-American War and kept as a colony until 1946. But America's ac-tions were hesitant and minor compared with those of the imperial powers of the old world. Indeed, he adds, it bespoke \"a lack of ambition\" that Americans failed to \"build on\" these early overseas exploits. Even the meltdown of European order in World War I did not incite the United States forcefully or quickly enough to embrace global leadership\u2014instead letting despots rise, with freedom trampled, and immo - rality victorious. American liberals, Kagan reports, were na\u00efve when fascists began schooling them. Their stern lesson was that the ascendancy of freedom was anything but inevitable and progress could somersault into terror. The arc of the moral universe has to be bent to - ward justice by force, or authoritarians will push it toward slavery\u2014or worse. \"Nations or movements\" that oppose the Enlighten- ment, Kagan writes, are generally viewed by liberals as \"aberrations, fleeting and ephem - eral, bumps on the long road of human progress.\" When fascism arose, especially in Adolf Hitler's Germany after 1933, the temptation was to let it pass\u2014not realizing that to secure freedom requires destroying its enemies. Liberals \"did not realize that if the world seemed to be moving in a liberal direction, it was because liberal powers had held a near monopoly on power.\"With fascists in charge in an increasing number of places, liberals had to unlearn their complacency and regain power through force. Kagan implies that Kristall - nacht was the catalyst for a still highly antisemitic United States to see beyond its isolationist blinders, prompting \"the first significant national discussion of foreign policy\" in two decades and finally threat - ening \"orthodoxies\" keeping the United States from its tryst with destiny. Hitler's crimes against the Jews, Kagan claims, caused opinion to shift \"well before most Americans regarded Germany as a direct threat to American security.\" Even then, Franklin Roosevelt only be - latedly came to accept neoconservative truths. If he did not commit to defend - ing freedom in a world of its enemies, he understood, they would have the last laugh. Liberals came to recognize Amer - ica's \"responsibility as a world power,\" as Kagan cites Senator Harry Truman saying in early 1938. Of course, as the Europe - an war loomed, such insights were not enough on their own, and it was Japan's bombing of Pearl Harbor that provided the final momentum for the United States to cross the threshold. From that day to this, Kagan writes, U.S. intervention has been indispensable to the future of liberalism, guaranteeing freedom militarily for the sake of peace and prosperity like none humanity has ever enjoyed. YET WHAT IS remarkable is how far Kagan goes in acknowledging that the United States once spurned its destiny so fully. This history of restraint makes neo- conservative precept far from self-evident. Kagan once insisted that the inward-looking and standoffish reputation of U.S. foreign policy for most of its history did not match the facts of our defiance of the age-old op - pression of kings from the start, and our expansionist zeal in spreading the gospel of freedom even when this country was a poorer, smaller, weaker power. But then, Dangerous Nation was composed before neoconservatism had melted down. The Ghost at the Feast reflects the im - plosion of that confidence. Americans had to cease their \"abstention from the world,\" not just then but now, too. Where Kagan once insisted that neoconservatism was a birthright, now he wants to illuminate what goes wrong when Americans agoniz - ingly give it up. Whatever his intentions, Kagan proves that interventionism is dif - ficult to generate and sustain; if it took the The Ghost at the Feast: America and the Collapse of World Order, 1900-1941 by Robert Kagan Knopf, 688 pp., $35.00 March 2023 54extraordinary events leading up to World War II to justify it in the 1940s, then it's little wonder that so many Americans lack enthusiasm for it today. A onetime crisis does not justify decades of policy stasis. And more than at any time in his career, Kagan also registers interventionism's costs and implausibilities even as he doubles down on it. First of all, he insists, U.S. wars have always been wars of choice, including World War II. He agrees that \"American security was not immediately or even pro - spectively threatened.\" Indeed, Kagan even entertains arguments that the war in the Pacific could have been avoided, since Ja - pan's attack on Pearl Harbor followed U.S. provocation; he cites former President Her - bert Hoover, who wrote the day after the attack that years of \"putting pins in rat - tlesnakes finally got this country bitten.\" \"The Japanese would have preferred not to go to war with the United States,\" Kagan agrees. The \"invulnerability\" of the United States is a powerful reason not to fight, Ka - gan concedes; and if so, then it also follows that our later record, in the arms trade and in proxy engagements alongside repeated wars, has always required arguments that go beyond self-defense. Finally, Kagan provides a half-sympa - thetic reading of those who claimed that our wars would require the very kind of imperialism that Americans believed only other countries practiced. Even if U.S. lead - ers might try to avoid crossing it, Kagan writes, \"the line between assuming 'world responsibility' and exerting hegemony was a thin one.\" Not only would endless war in - flict suffering and death abroad, it would also alter the United States itself, in the familiar story of the degradation of liberty in the name of national security. Already America's entry into World War I brought a reign of terror, with the suppression of labor unions and pacificist groups, and notably the jailing of Socialist presiden - tial candidate Eugene Debs. (\"War means autocracy,\" President Woodrow Wilson himself remarked shortly after the Unit - ed States declared war on Germany.) His administration took the first steps toward building a national security and surveil - lance state that subsequent wars\u2014not least the war on terrorism\u2014have made fixtures of U.S. \"freedom.\" The new anti-war left (and right), of course, frequently point to such facts. Before the war in Ukraine, arguments against \"the United States of war,\" as the anthropologist David Vine recently called it, were leading many Americans to revisit the morality of the arms trade, military basing, proxy fighting, targeted killings, and full-fledged invasions of recent de - cades. That Kagan acknowledges these concerns, even if it's only to repeat his in - terventionist credo, reflects a remarkable change in the intellectual climate. It is much more difficult today to make the case for a \"neocon nation\" without recognizing the peaceful alternative. WITHIN WEEKS OF Putin's invasion of Ukraine last February, Commentary editor John Podhoretz dashed off a much-noticed piece titled \" neoconservatism: a vin - dication .\" Having failed to deter Russia, he reasoned, Americans should now con - cede that the neoconservatives were always right: If armed force does not back our val - ues, our foes will smash them. Kagan's own response to Russia's act showed he basically agreed: \"Now that Putin has made his mis - takes,\" Kagan explained, \"the question is whether the United States will continue to make its own mistakes or whether Ameri - cans will learn, once again, that it is better to contain aggressive autocracies early, be - fore they have built up a head of steam and the price of stopping them rises.\" But rather than indulging in sectarian gloating like Podhoretz, Kagan took a dif - ferent tone. He has continued to ascend the ramparts to speak for liberalism (or democracy), shedding a controversial la-bel for his enduring creed, arguing for its relevance to new friends among liberals who have rehabilitated him. (\"Categories are always problematic,\" he explained in September 2022 to interviewer Yascha Mounk, who asked him if he'd still call himself a neocon.) After all, it is the right that now threat - ens liberalism and democracy alike in the United States itself. In response to the evolv - ing situation, in 2019 Kagan argued in a 9,000-word piece in The Washington Post that at the core of world history is the contest between authoritarianism and democracy: Authoritarian \"strongmen\" ruled the world from its beginnings, and by standing up for freedom in the twenty-first century, we return to the familiar and fundamental task of keeping autocracy and despotism in check. Kagan's view is now widely shared. Biden's last State of the Union address put this binary at its center: \"In the battle between democracy and autocracies, de - mocracies are rising to the moment,\" he noted. \"We will save democracy.\"Kagan has several connections to the Biden administration. Not only is his former co-author, Antony Blinken, now Biden's secretary of state, but Kagan's wife, Victoria Nuland, has been deeply involved in Ukraine policy under the last two Dem - ocratic presidents. She has recalled that she and Kagan fell in love \"talking about democracy and the role of America in the world.\" In 2014, The New York Times report - ed that, acting as his \"unofficial editor,\" Nuland \"carves up his drafts,\" though in the same profile, the couple denies that their views on policy influence each other. \"It's a touchy question,\" Kagan has complained. \"Because when she does something, like on Ukraine, the left\u2014and right\u2014go, 'Oh that's just those neocons.'\" Biden has not gone as far on Ukraine as some neoconservatives would like: He ago - nizingly withdrew from Afghanistan, and has merely armed Ukraine to the teeth and provided other military assistance, rather than imposing no-fly zones or intervening directly. Yet there is no doubt that the war has reanimated the zombie of liberal inter - nationalism for the foreseeable future. \"The degree of unanimity among the democratic allies, and the degree to which the demo - cratic allies have all looked to the United States to provide the essential leadership\" amid the Ukraine crisis, Kagan rejoiced in his interview with Mounk, \"is proof that the United States still wields enormous influ-ence in the international system.\" As Kagan has long understood, liberals and neoconservatives in the last half- century have tended to agree on foreign policy more than their intermittent bick - ering implied. It now looks as if the Iraq imbroglio drove them apart only briefly. Both are now getting back to the militariza - tion of the globe under U.S. auspices that their representatives have defended, pet - ty squabbling aside. If there was a chance to put either or both in their place in our time, it was missed. From Iraq to Ukraine, Kagan may well be one of the most damagingly influen - tial foreign policy intellectuals the United States has produced in our time, helping American exceptionalism survive long past its sell-by date. His recent comeback may be his most chilling\u2014and spectacular\u2014 success. There is a moral imperative for Ukraine to defend itself, but there is no last battle for democracy there, nor are illiberal powers more threatening to freedom than decades of U.S. crusades abroad. Kagan has helped American elites pivot beyond 55 Books & the Arts the recriminations of the past and return U.S. foreign policy to \"normalcy\" for what is likely now to be a frightening global fu - ture of new enemies, with China standing behind Russia as the next implacable foe. For that is where it is leading. Kagan has been calling to face down the Chinese threat since the beginning of his career\u2014in spite of the irony that it was Kagan's bugbear, Trump, who realized his decades-long dream of a new Cold War against the latest enemy. The truth is that, all along, not much ever separated neocons such as Kagan from a nationalist such as Trump, except the pre - tense that what is good for the United States, including all its war-making, is good for the world. But then, the events of the past year show that opinion can change quickly. And American militarism and nationalism advertised as devices of universal emanci - pation are hardly likely to work any better simply because their defenders have res - cued them temporarily from doubt.

The acci - dent widowed his wife, Katharine, then 46, leaving her to support their two sons as well as an unmarried sister. But her circum - stances did not remain straitened for long. With startup capital funded by the sale of her jewelry and help from family friends, in 1911 Katharine bought the Providence School for Secretaries, soon changing the name to the Katharine Gibbs School. Equal parts finishing school and vocational acad - emy, the venture was so successful that, by 1918, Gibbs had satellite campuses in Boston and New York, and, by 1930, she was living on Park Avenue with her fami - ly and three full-time servants, pulling in what would be the equivalent of $1.4 mil - lion a year today. The Gibbs School did much more than make its founder fabulously wealthy: It helped establish the image of the secretary as an unfailingly professional, naturally de - mure, and resolutely feminine helpmate. \"Katie Gibbs girls,\" as they eventually came to be known, were fined for chewing gum in class. They prepared coffee in silver-plated urns, and from the 1940s to the mid-1960s were required to wear white gloves. Lucy Graves Mayo, a Gibbs instructor and au - thor of the 1965 advice manual You Can Be an Executive Secretary , preached that achievement in the field required recog - nizing that the \"boss is KING.\"This was the state of affairs second-wave feminists deplored when they threw ste - nography pads into the so-called Freedom Trash Can during protests at the 1968 Miss America pageant in Atlantic City. So entwined was the Gibbs School with the popular conception of secretarial labor as stereotypical women's work that, when the National Organization for Women marched through Manhattan during the 1970 Wom - en's Strike for Equality, the school was one of the few stops it made. NOW members forced their way into the lobby and squared up to president Alan L. Baker, whom they reproached for perpetuating occupational segregation\u2014and for referring to his grown women students as \"girls.\" In the decades that followed, a new mod - el for women's work defined itself against everything the secretary signified. The aspiration of \"corporate feminism\" was to ascend to the top of the executive lad- der, to be the boss instead of doing his filing\u2014and, supposedly, to improve the lot of all working women with your own personal accomplishments. According to this logic, individual success is valorized at the expense of collective rights, and any choice a woman makes is, by virtue of her gender alone, deemed \"empowering.\" Corporate feminism's most recognizable (and controversial) figurehead has been former Meta chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, whose 2013 paean to the radical power of corporate gamesmanship, Lean In, launched a thousand imitators\u2014and at least as many magazine pieces. (Though also notable is Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso, who popularized the term \"girl - boss\" shortly before mismanaging her fast fashion empire into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.) Beyond publicity, the actual gains of CEO-style feminism have been narrow. While women's workforce participation increased by nearly a quarter between 1950 and 2010, clerical work continued to be the most common job for women. Yet corporate feminism has spread beyond the c-suite, to become perhaps the most culturally dominant form of feminism, even if its primacy is now on the wane. For years, female executives occupied a rarefied place in the media firmament, posing for glossy magazine profiles with blowouts and baby bumps. They proselytized the hustle on the Today show, in the captions of artful Instagram posts, and especially from the makeshift stages of convention halls. In 2016, Bloomberg reported that there had been so many women's empow - erment and networking events the previous fall that it would have been feasible to at - tend one almost every day\u2014whether Tina Brown's Women in the World Summit or newscaster Mika Brzezinski's Know Your Value conference. Communication scholar Allison Elias points out in her new book that the tri - umph of corporate feminism was far from inevitable, but the result of struggle within the feminist movement and the changing face of American capitalism. Starting in the 1960s, her book traces two competing visions for women's working lives. One path forward lay through pulling togeth- er and improving the work that women already did\u2014with activist organizations like 9to5 agitating for better conditions at the office. Another path meant leav - ing that work behind, and aiming for more powerful, better-paid positions\u2014a feminism focused on breaking the class ceiling. If corporate feminism is now on the downswing from its 2010s heyday, then the unfinished project of 9to5 pres - ents an increasingly appealing alternative. ELIAS'S STORY BEGINS far from the corner offices and TED talks of corporate feminism as we have come to know it. In - stead it starts with the attempts of clerical workers to improve their lot. Some of the heroes of her book are the leaders of 9to5, which was co-founded by Karen Nuss - baum and nine other secretaries in Boston in 1973. Nussbaum was a veteran of the By Jess BergmanCorporate Takeover The rise of Lean In-style feminism\u2014 and the women who fought for a better alternative 57 Books & the Arts Black Panther Support Committee, who began turning her attention to women's issues after an alienating experience with the male-dominated culture of the Students for a Democratic Society. While working as a clerk-typist at Harvard, she set out to build an organization that would rally around \"the immediate needs of office workers\"\u2014many of whom did not identify with the feminist movement, even if they were influenced by its ideas. To set its agenda, 9to5 surveyed sec- retaries throughout Boston, collecting information about income, health insur - ance, and other benefits, as well as \"job descriptions, job training, and the pres - ence or absence of union campaigns.\" To attract membership, the group produced a newsletter replete with anecdotes from fellow secretaries about enduring bad pay, disrespect, and boredom on the job; mem- bers distributed it during commuting hours at transit stops and outside the insurance firms where many clericals worked, delib - erately dressing in sedate office wear rather than denim, which might betray their proj - ect's radical hopes to hesitant recruits. Their first meeting, held in November 1973, attracted 50 women; by 1977, the group had chapters in 13 cities, 10,000 members, and an operating budget of $700,000. But as 9to5 grew, it struggled with an in - ternal contradiction. The group appealed to women whose concerns were primar - ily economic\u2014they were seeking better pay and conditions for the work they were currently doing. But its membership also included women whose concerns were mainly professional\u2014specifically, women who hoped to cross over from clerical work into management. The first of 9to5's industry-specific subcommittees, Women in Publishing, was largely made up of women in the lat - ter category. WIP members tended to be college-educated, and while they support - ed the union activity of clerical workers at Boston-based publishing companies Allyn & Bacon and Beacon, their own platform was \"focused on career development,\" Elias writes. In the 1970s, women inter - ested in careers in publishing had little choice but to begin in administrative roles, and many found\u2014despite a few highly publicized success stories\u2014that it was nearly impossible to move into editorial or managerial positions regardless of their job performance, while men with less ex - perience quickly ascended the ranks. (In publishing, as in other industries, hyper- competence could perversely work against a secretary's desire to switch career tracks, as it made her even more indispensable to her boss.) WIP's response to these conditions was largely procedural: Members filed com - plaints with the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Com - mission, alleging that their employers were failing to comply with the affirmative ac- tion requirements established by President Lyndon Johnson in the mid-1960s. When a group of women at Houghton Mifflin saw that their charges of sex and wage discrim - ination would not be addressed by these agencies in a timely fashion, they filed a class-action lawsuit in 1975 and became known as the \"Houghton Mifflin Five.\" WIP's pressure campaign achieved some modest wins. It demanded, for instance, that companies should post managerial and editorial job opportunities internally, ILLUSTRATION BY HANNA BARCZYK March 2023 58so that clerical workers would have the chance to apply for higher-level positions. Members believed they only needed equal - ity of opportunity to succeed. By 1976, they'd convinced at least seven Boston-area publishing houses to change their job post - ing systems. But the effects were minimal. Companies invested in consultants and emergent HR departments that would help them meet their affirmative action burdens on the cheap by hiring externally and ma - nipulating job titles for reporting purposes, rather than by helping clerical workers' transition onto the editorial or managerial ladder (or by, say, raising their salaries). The goals of groups like WIP were rea - sonable: Women should be informed of job openings at their own companies and considered viable candidates for positions outside their classification on the basis of their potential, as men so often are. Yet their strategies \"unwittingly fractured the feminist agenda at work,\" separat- ing the women who would rise up the ranks and receive better treatment and com - pensation as a result from the majority who would continue in low-level positions. This split only became more dramatic over the 1980s and 1990s, as clerical work became more precarious. With the rise of computing, the secretarial profession became nearly as vulnerable to de-skilling as factory work. The widespread adoption of video display terminals led to a steep increase in workplace injury, particularly eye strain and carpal tunnel syndrome. The fact that secretaries across the country had quickly learned to master a new form of technology did not increase the pro - fession's esteem. Rather, automation led to the offshoring of clerical labor to Mexi- co, the Caribbean, and Asia, and enabled companies to transform many full-time jobs into part-time, temporary positions. In response to these changes, 9to5 creat - ed a nationwide clerical union, District 925 of the Service Employees International Union ( seiu ), in 1981. Yet as the profession changed, the organization \"struggled to find a unifying agenda and identity,\" and it faced the headwinds of the anti-union Reagan administration. Elias writes that the union was \"decertified or lost elections in all but three private-sector organiza - tions during the 1980s.\" Some companies, like Equitable Life Insurance in Syracuse, New York, simply closed up shop when District 925 won an election there. seiu and 9to5's experiment was far from an out - right failure, but it proved unable to raise union density among U.S. clerical workers to even 10 percent. It also failed to slow the spread of a workplace feminism centered on professionalization, one that ascribed the low status of secretaries to their inabil- ity to \"make it\" in a more prestigious field. AT TIMES, ELIAS'S book may give the im - pression that corporate feminism became the dominant form of workplace feminism almost by accident: The splintering of the second wave and subsequent backlash to the women's movement coincided with the neoliberal turn in American gover - nance, and corporate feminism outlasted more collectively minded alternatives be - cause it was most compatible with market logic. But a closer look at the period Elias covers\u2014when a new media ecosystem mar - keting to professionally ambitious women thrived\u2014shows its success was more than a historical fluke. Corporate feminism was a coherent ideology in its own right, one many women flocked to out of enthusiasm rather than necessity. Working Woman magazine, launched in November 1976, was \"the first maga - zine explicitly for wage-earning women,\" Elias writes. Its debut issue, titled Making It!, did not disguise its relationship to the feminist movement: In a letter to readers, editor Beatrice Buckler positions the mag - azines as a kind of Ms. for professionals, heralding a \"social revolution\" with \"new roles for single women,\" and \"new relation - ships between mothers and children, men Boston, 1974: Organizers from 9to5 focused on building collective power at work rather than individual success. PAUL CONNELL/THE BOSTON GLOBE/GETTY 59 Books & the Arts and women.\" The rest of the issue is full of practical and cosmetic advice, devoted to concerns like the use of injectable silicone to treat acne scars and balancing a career with romance. One of its more substan - tial pieces, \" office politics: running a clean campaign ,\" cautions working women that they must temper their \"do - mestic set of values (honesty, openness, and trust)\" with \"business ethics (com - petition, aggressiveness, productivity, winning).\" Journalist Victoria Pellegrino urges an every-woman-for-herself indi - vidualism: \"There are few rescue squads in business, fewer knights in shining ar - mor,\" she writes. \"You and nobody else have to be in charge of your career.\" This rhetoric was very different from the strat - egies promoted by second-wave feminists or more pragmatic groups like 9to5, and it attracted a significant audience: By 1980, Working Woman was the fastest-growing magazine in America. The next decade brought a new and am - bitious competitor. Savvy billed itself as \"The Magazine for Executive Women,\" and it, too, recognized its debt to feminism. The first issue included an impassioned editorial in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment by Ms. co-founder Jane O'Reilly. Its lineup contained many major elements of full-blown popular corpo - rate feminism today: a focus on finding mentors, inspirational success stories, and having it all. Perhaps the issue's most representative article is Jane Wilson's \"networks ,\" which predicts that wom - en's professional networks will \"become the feminist phenomenon of the 1980's,\" channeling the energies once captured by consciousness-raising groups and other more radical collectives. She chas - tises the previous decade's period of \"high feminism\" for its \"negative\" focus on \"the pitiable condition of women in sexist soci - ety\" and presents networking as a \"cheap, bootstrapping method of taking direct action on one's own behalf.\" Bra-burners beware, Wilson warns: \"Although network - ing grew directly out of the women's move - ment, its rationale is sharply different in many respects.... The first requirement for network membership is more or less naked self-interest.\" Alongside these publications rose a raft of how-to books advising women on the best ways to rise through the profes - sional ranks with nothing but their own ingenuity. Among them was Betty Lehan Harragan's Games Mother Never Taught You: Corporate Gamesmanship for Women, published in 1977. Harragan, a longtime member of NOW, outlined the forces ar - rayed against women in the office: not just their social ostracism from a boy's-club culture, but outright discrimination and sexual harassment, too. Rather than ad - vocating to tear the whole rotten system down, however, she provided a blueprint to exploiting it for your own benefit. Harragan argues that corporate structures take their cue from military hierarchy, and that the \"everyday operations\" of private industry resemble team sports\u2014two idioms women must master if they want to compete with men at work. And as for unwanted sexu - al overtures, well, a woman's \"continued success may be her expertise in blocking these passes while maintaining a pleasant, friendly, unsullied work relationship with the man (men) involved.\" This grin-and- bear-it ethos is justified by the idea that until a woman reaches the c-suite, she has no chance of changing company culture. As such, Harragan is disdainful of working women who set their sights any lower than CEO\u2014and secretaries come in for special censure. \"A secretarial job classification is the supreme dead-end,\" she writes. \"Obvi- ously, a woman with ambitions must blast out of this job classification before she can become a team candidate.\" Harragan's book became a minor sen - sation: It was assigned in undergraduate college courses and at business schools; adapted into a CBS-TV movie in 1982 (co-starring future Law & Order stalwart Sam Waterston); and, as the cover of the 1989 edition boasted, it sold over a million copies. But it was simply the most suc - cessful of a glut of professional self-help aimed at women, a genre less notable for producing blockbusters than for its sheer volume. In a review in these pages in 1986, Barbara Ehrenreich waded through a pile of books with titles like The Right Moves: Succeeding in a Man' s World Without a Harvard MBA and Feminine Leadership: Or How to Succeed in Business Without Be - ing One of the Boys , each offering similar advice with a twist here and there. Since the 1970s, Ehrenreich observes, \"scores\" of such guides had transformed the pop - ular image of the \"liberated woman\" into \"a tidy executive who carries an attach\u00e9 case and is skilled in discussing market shares and leveraged buy-outs.\" The overwhelming majority of pro - fessional self-help, Ehrenreich proposes, pointed to a hollowness in the whole pur - suit. \"Perhaps the most striking thing about the literature for and about the corporate woman,\" she writes, \"is how little it has to say about the purposes, other than person - al advancement, of the corporate 'game.'\" Corporate feminism, with its relentless fo - cus on success, lacked perspective on what might make labor meaningful, or indeed any different from the full-time domestic drudgery that many working women had only just left behind. The dream nurtured by the women of the Houghton Mifflin Five a decade earlier, of receiving better wages for creative work, had been reduced to the single-minded pursuit of money and power for its own sake. But there was a burgeoning genre of ad - vice, marketed to both men and women, designed to fix this problem. Career self- help in the '80s increasingly trumpeted the notion that a career is a calling and that work is an extension of your true self. One notable example was Richard Nelson Bolles's What Color Is Your Parachute? , a spiritual guide to job selection that Bolles, an out-of-work priest, originally distribut - ed to other unemployed clergy as a kind of proto-zine in 1970. He revised it for the general public in the mid '70s, after which it became a bestseller for decades. The book and others like it, the sociologist Micki McGee has written, \"channeled the coun - terculture value of self-fulfillment back into the productive spheres\u2014back into the workplace.\" Bolles laments that \"the world is currently filled with workers whose weeklong cry is, 'When is the weekend go - ing to be here?'\" Rather than reflecting a problem with the way we organize work, he contends that such dissatisfied employees need only to discover \"what they uniquely have to offer to the world.\"The Rise of Corporate Feminism: Women in the American Office, 1960-1990 by Allison Elias Columbia University Press, 312 pp., $35.00 March 2023 60Jess Bergman is an editor at The Baffler. By the time Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In became a sensation in 2013, there was little sign of the angst Ehrenreich had detected three decades earlier. Indeed, Sandberg's book takes for granted that a woman's suc - cess is a moral and political good in itself, even a revolutionary one. Lean In is a man- ifesto of individualism that proceeds from the premise that \"the shift to a more equal world will happen person by person\"\u2014and only once those persons adjust their behav - ior to better suit the status quo. Sandberg pays lip service to the \"real obstacles in the professional world\" that women en - counter, like discrimination, harassment, insufficient policies around parental leave and childcare. But the true concern of her book is the way \"women are hindered by barriers that exist within ourselves,\" name - ly a lack of self-confidence, assertiveness, and ambition, internal obstacles that she inaccurately claims have gone under- explored. Despite dressing the book up in cutting-edge social science findings, Elias notes, Sandberg \"was offering recommen - dations similar to those that had imbued the advice literature of the 1970s and 1980s.\" It resonated: Five years after its publi - cation, Lean In had sold 4.2 million copies worldwide and was continuing to move an additional 12,500 copies a month. Where once the consciousness-raising group had given way to the network, now there were tens of thousands of Lean In \"circles\" where women \"met regularly to discuss and im- plement Sandberg's guidance,\" according to The Washington Post . The vogue that Lean In sparked for women's professional development became much bigger than the book itself, spawning a lucrative industry of workshops and conferences, and elevat - ing figures like Glossier's Emily Weiss, the Wing's Audrey Gelman, and Moon Juice's Amanda Chantal Bacon as role models and thinkfluencers. If the economic fruits of corporate feminism failed to trickle down as prophesied, its moral code certainly did: its encouragement of would-be en - trepreneurs to harness their social media profiles as marketing tools, work around the clock, and treat self-interestedness as a virtue. Even women who didn't actually aspire to executive positions began to fret about their personal brands, adopting cor - porate feminism as more of a lifestyle than a strategy for career advancement. Some 40 years on from the founding of Work - ing Woman , the movement's message was simple, confident, and extremely popular. UNTIL IT WASN'T . While corporate feminism has had astute critics from the very beginning, it's only in the last few years that its failures have been widely noted. The fame and personal wealth of a handful of female CEOs did not create a flood of opportunities for the women be - low them on the corporate ladder, nor did it necessarily lead to more hospitable en - vironments for women in the companies they presided over: Nasty Gal was sued for illegally terminating pregnant employees; female executives at luggage retailer Away were accused of publicly berating their workers and demanding uncompensated overtime; and both Gelman and Bacon, among others, were called out by Black for - mer employees for fostering racism in the workplace while catering primarily to an elite white clientele. That's not to mention Sandberg herself, whose continued work at Meta is notable not only for the lack of good it has done women in the abstract, but for its very tangible harms, such as exposing user data to the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica in 2016 and knowing - ly contributing to eating disorders among teenage girls on Instagram.It's probably not a coincidence that the bloom is off corporate feminism's rose at a moment when the Covid-19 pandemic has underscored the precarity of many women's economic positions; between job losses and increased caregiving de - mands, millions have been pushed out of the workforce over the last three years. The flood of bad press about individual She-E- Os has been accompanied by a series of unflattering pop culture portrayals, from Amanda Seyfried's Emmy-winning turn as disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, to Leigh Stein's scathing portrayal of a wellness startup in the 2020 novel Self Care , to the emotionally stunted young investment bankers of HBO's Industry . In the last three years alone, outlets in - cluding Forbes, Wired, The Atlantic , Fast Company , Jezebel , Adweek, and The Cut have declared the end of the girlboss era. And on social media, particularly among younger women, the tenets of corporate feminism now persist mostly as a meme: \"Gaslight Gatekeep Girlboss.\" The movement's innovations were al- Katharine Gibbs, the twentieth-century doyenne of secret- arial education, was after all what we might today call a \"female founder.\" And while her vision of success was very different from, say, Sheryl Sandberg's, the advice she gave her students was similar in sub - stance to the lessons peddled by so many corporate feminists who followed in her wake: Work hard, don't rock the boat, and never forget to smile. As the ashes of the girlboss are scat - tered to the winds, The Rise of Corporate Feminism reminds us that the truly novel moments in the history of feminism at the office concern the much trickier efforts of women to improve the conditions of their jobs together\u2014and how those efforts changed them. In \" women workers and the yale strike ,\" her 1985 account of Yale's nascent clerical and technical em- ployee union, historian Molly Ladd-Taylor describes how, in the course of their orga - nizing campaign, \"women who had never before stood up for themselves learned to run lunch meetings, speak before large groups, talk back to their supervisors, and lead other workers to stand up to Yale.\" Col - lective action allowed them to step out of their everyday roles, and understand their own abilities in new ways. In other words, they felt empowered. Even women who didn't actually aspire to executive positions began to fret about their personal brands, adopting corporate feminism as a lifestyle. 61 Books & the Arts MICHAEL PUTLAND/GETTYWe got to have a Sinatra, but \"Strangers in the Night\"?

The more time one spends wandering around the Proustian jukebox that is Bob Dylan's The Philosophy of Modern Song , the more tempted one is to imagine it resembling a marathon listening party with a college friend\u2014eclectic, shaggy, and impish, if a tad more inscrutable than anybody's best friend would dare. These song titles are among 66 that Dylan has selected for his idiosyncratic, compulsively epigram - matic survey of popular music, reaching as far back as \"Nelly Was a Lady,\" written in 1849. Scholars, along with mandarins, culture cops, and other spoilsports, might propose that Dylan needed to produce a book of this ambition and scope to val - idate his 2016 Nobel Prize in literature. For some, it still won't be enough without even a semiformal statement of purpose, detailing whatever it is he's trying to do and just how \"philosophical\" he intends to be. Yet Dylan has never been interested in anything so straightforward as explaining himself . The Philosophy of Modern Song , among myriad other things, is an elabo - rately apportioned thank-you card from its author for everything the craft of song has given him through his 81 years on Earth. Though its title suggests a system of thought itself as a skeleton key to how genres and subgenres of popular music fit into each other, the book is far too subjective and far too personal a document to be viewed as pure history or, as some would have it, pop criticism. It is, instead, pure Dylan in its allusive, dreamlike musings, each of them digressing and spinning into the strange or exotic in the manner of Dylan songs like \"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,\" \"Mag - gie's Farm,\" or \"Idiot Wind.\" If, for Leonard Cohen, songs made up a tower, songs for Dylan are a Monument Valley of varied terrain and big skies, with plenty of room for him to project his own mind-movies, submit his own testimony as to how these songs came to be, where they landed, and what can be deciphered from their echoes. SONG LYRICS, DYLAN considers, can appear \"slight\" when written on the page. \"But it's important to remember,\" he adds, \"that these words were written for the ear and not for the eye. And as in comedy, where a seemingly simple sentence can YOU'RE NOT SURE how long it's been since you last heard from him. But when you get to be 70-whatever, you're never sure how long anything is. You do remem - ber that you're both members of the Class of '69 and that you smoked metric tons of weed between classes. And, no, dammit, it's not a universally acknowledged truth that if you remember anything about the '60s, you weren't there! There was a whole lot to remember, especially the acres of music you guys locked into, no mat - ter how ancient, arcane, or campy. And now, he's dropping by again, as shaggy, disheveled, and loosely attired in den - im as he was back in freshman year, only with whitecaps now breaking through his thick-as-ever beard. With the barest pre - liminaries, he plops down the armloads of LPs he's lugged from the minivan parked in your driveway, and you're ready to spend the weekend living your lives over again on your beat-up turntable. The playlists sprawl through genres and eras. Of course, there's Elvis; only not just Presley (\"Money \"Viva Las Vegas\") also Costello (\"Pump generational touchstones: Carl Sally,\" the Who's \"My Gen - eration.\" Then there's all the postgrad '70s stuff, some of it more durable than expected: Jackson Browne's \"The Pretender,\" Har - old Melvin & the Blue Notes' \"If You Don't Know Me by Now,\" as always, there are the eruptions where each of you wonders whether the other has lost his mind. Really, man? \"Whiff - enpoof Song\"? By Bing Crosby ? Johnnie Ray's \"The Little White Cloud That Cried\"? Dean Martin's take on \"Blue Moon\" (and not the by the Marcels)? And Cher's \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\"? What are all those people doing mixed up in this batch with the Fugs' \"C.I.A. Man\" or Nina Sim- one's \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\"? Preserving the Mystery Bob Dylan declines to explain himself. By Gene Seymour March 2023 62transform into a joke through the magic of performance, an inexplicable thing hap - pens when words are set to music. The miracle is in their union.\" In his pieces on each song, Dylan of - ten tries to preserve their unquantifiable appeal rather than aiming to pin down their own essence and explain what makes them work. Marty Robbins's 1959 \"El Paso\" \"hardly says anything you understand,\" he writes, \"but if you throw in the signs, sym - bols, and shapes, it hardly says anything that you don't understand.\" I'm not sure his assessment applies to Robbins's pulp Western romance, whose narrative ele - ments are as straightforward as a roadside diner's breakfast special. But as a gateway to how Dylan hears music, it reveals almost everything about the digressions, specu - lations, and postulations spinning in each of these 66 case studies. Conviction goes a long way with Dylan, no matter where it comes from. Early in the book, he turns to Perry Como's 1951 \"Without a Song.\" (\" That field of corn would never see a plow / That field of corn would be deserted now / A young one' s born, but he' s no good no how / Without a song .\") He intro - duces Como as \"the anti-American Idol\": He is anti-flavor of the week, anti-hot list, and anti-bling. He was a Cadillac before the tail fins; a Colt .45, not a Glock; steak and potatoes, not California cuisine. Perry Como stands and delivers. No artifice, no forcing one syllable to spread itself thin along many notes. In the folklore of mid-twentieth-century pop culture, Perry Como is the King of Melt - ed Cheese, \"Mister Nice Guy,\" the dulcet, double-knit embodiment of suburban dream life. Dylan might be picking fights right off the bat by placing such a figure, the antithesis to the disorderly energies of rock and roll, near the foreground of his Philosophy. But is he? True, Como wasn't Elvis or Little Richard, but, as Dylan sug- gests, Como was his own distinctive brand of existential hero, a durable avatar of the job well done. No social protest, no hyper- realistic vision can sustain itself without the tempered fluidity found in a Perry Como performance. Dylan is dispatching alerts to his readers early in the game: Flash-freeze your biases and forget whatever you think you know. Perry Como is a guru of having a life's purpose. Maybe he wouldn't put it that way, and neither would Dylan. But Dylan's challenge here is to anybody who thinks they've got it all figured out in advance. You think Perry Como's a square? Then what, or who, does that make Dylan? Or you? Dylan's discussion of \"Without a Song\" itself is more cryptic. He begins, opaquely, by observing that the lyrics don't \"really name the song that the world would be worse off if it never heard.\" He just writes it off as a \"mystery,\" one of many, swirling throughout the book, that you'll have to either untangle or accept. Dylan tends to let the reader draw their own associations. Trot over to left field, for instance, with Vic Damone's 1956 version of \"On the Street Where You Live\" from My Fair Lady . Dylan's exegesis is accom - panied by a wedding photo with Damone as the groom and the ill-starred film ac - tress Pier Angeli as the bride, taken in the fall of 1954. On the next page, there are two photos of James Dean with Angeli, whom Dylan characterizes as \"the love of James Dean's life.\" You'd have to go online to find out that Dean and Angeli dated be - tween 1952 and 1953, and that Angeli and Damone married in the fall of 1954. You find out from Dylan that Dean \"waited across the street on his motorcycle on [her] wed - ding day.\" Recalling the song's premise\u2014of a young man returning time and again to the block of the girl he loves\u2014Dylan sug- gests at the very end of this meditation, \"Maybe for the rest of his short life, this was a song that belonged to James Dean.\" OK. A song that was part of a musical that didn't open on Broadway until six months after Dean died in a car crash belonged to him? I'm buying in. Seriously. Context can only take you so far in this seminar. Why should it? Unless you can cre - ate one where no one else thought to look. In a compendium of virtuoso spritzing, the weirdest, most inspired performance could well be the six pages Dylan devotes to Santana's 1970 recording \"Black Magic Woman,\" which was written two years ear - lier by Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green. He sees the song's titular figure as \"a hard case, full of mumbo jumbo and her kisses have a pungent smell.\" There isn't much Dylan can do to evoke a phantasmagorical \"Black Magic Woman\" more vividly than the song does. Instead, he nerds out with a portrait of a true-life \"black magic woman\": the prolific and versatile science-fiction novelist and screenwriter Leigh Brackett (1915-1978), whose film credits include The Big Sleep, Rio Bravo, and The Empire Strikes Back, and whose science-fiction and fantasy books include 1955's The Long Tomorrow and 1953's The Sword of Rhian- non, set in the ruins of an ancient Martian civilization that figured out high-tech mil - lions of years before Earth. To be clear, Dylan's not saying Brackett is the woman who literally inspired the song, but someone the song brought to (his) mind, yet another stretch of free association sneaking into the symposium from anoth - er quadrant of the pop cultural universe. Dylan is especially struck that The Sword of Rhiannon \"presaged\" one of Arthur C. Clarke's three laws of science fiction: \" Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistin - guishable from magic .\" Or as Dylan quotes directly from Brackett, \"Witchcraft to the ignorant ... simple science to the learned.\" For Dylan, this distinction between science and magic also helps define music, the one \"place where additional learning does not disentangle the mystery of the subject.\" It's the kind of gnomic observation that at once opens and closes off possibilities for elaboration. He submits a variation on music's mystery, but neither offers a clue nor shows an inclination to solve it. WHAT IS MOST stunning, though it shouldn't be, is the tenderness Dylan of - ten displays toward his fellow craftsman; compassion that is especially evident in his back-to-back appreciations of Warren Zevon and John Trudell. He extols Zevon's \"Dirty Life and Times,\" the opening track from his last album\u2014released in 2003, the year he died\u2014as a \"great record,\" adding the rueful observation that \"the braggart, the rou\u00e9, the ironic observer, and the inebriated fool were all roles Zevon chose to play in his songs. And possibly at times in his life. But stripped to the bone, as in this song, the artistry jumps out at you like spring-loaded snakes from a gag jar of peanut brittle.\"The Philosophy of Modern Song by Bob Dylan Simon & Schuster, 352 pp., $45.00 63 Books & the Arts The lesser-known but deeply respected Trudell, who died of cancer in 2015 at 69, was an Indigenous American poet, actor, and ac - tivist who was a leader of the 1969 takeover of Alcatraz Island. To honor his memory, Dylan chooses \"Doesn't Hurt Anymore\" (2001), a part-spoken, part-sung lament that lists, in Dylan's words, \"a million ways to go mad\" that impede the determination to endure. \"John was not mainstream,\" Dylan writes. \"He didn't talk about popu - lar subjects like hustling drugs, pimping, and materialism, glorifying those things. John's music can elevate you and usually does. Maybe there isn't a place for that.\" He's talking here, sadly, about the mar - ketplace. Some of the more poignant photos illustrating The Philosophy of Modern Song , including the back cover, are period photos of people shopping for brand-new vinyl records; there's even a frontispiece spread of workers in the Columbia record factory sliding LPs into slipcovers. These images float around the other archival artwork and textual observations like furtive dreams of a more economically prosperous post- World War II era of unprecedented growth in mass communications; nostalgic not just for a booming record industry, but for the means through which music was marketed and sold. These were the circumstances that al- lowed Bob Dylan's ascension; they allowed him, also, to define and reshape his public persona, his musical ideology, even his own mythology. Such a time seems remote from our own. Even if post-millennial technol - ogy provides all kinds of the machinery, digital or otherwise, for pop celebrity to lay siege to public consciousness, few of us can say with any certainty how \"selling records\" works now\u2014or what, for that mat - ter, a \"record\" is. The Philosophy of Modern Song, much like the ruins of the Martian civilization in Leigh Brackett's book, is an artifact of arcane magical processes that seem out of reach, yet still familiar enough to recollect, if not revive. THOUGH DYLAN PROMISES philosophy, he never really sets out an accounting of his worldview\u2014and he doesn't have to. Has anybody else come up with a line that evokes the specter of late-twentieth- century inertia as neatly and frighteningly as, \"We sit here stranded, though we're all doing our best to deny it\"? I'd put up any song or lyric from 1965's Bringing It All Back Home against, or alongside, a given Nobelist's literary work from the same pe - riod for the way its recorded texts jar their listeners toward wide-eyed radiance. There are in \"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\" \"Gates Only Bleeding)\" rapid-fire mosaics of the prophetic, the apocalyptic, and the apho - ristic; sometimes, all three at once, as in the deathless assertion \"that he not busy being born is busy dying.\" The song lyrics of the '60s and '70s (and not just Dylan's) were so directly, intri - cately entwined with their time and their generation's collective unconscious that many of us too young to know any better believed calling them \"song lyrics\" was reductive, even cheapening, when mea - sured against the higher calling of po - etry. At their best, Dylan's engagements with the metaphysical and the suggestive, along with more declamatory jabs at the body politic like \"Blowin' in the Wind\" or \"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,\" revived a tradition of songs as self-con - tained vehicles for sweeping, absorbing adventure, like novels and movies. But whatever profundities there were to draw from their content, whatever mysteries were weaved within their core, Dylan's songs were still, essentially, songs\u2014even if you wished to dive into them to comb for secrets to the universe, if not whole universes themselves.

At first glance, An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations might not have seemed likely to become an intellectual landmark. To call it wide-ranging is an understatement; the opposite of a tightly focused, logical argu - ment, its five volumes and 1,000-plus pages range over everything from the problems with apprenticeship to the origins of mon - ey to the \"discouragement of agriculture in the ancient state of Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire.\" Adam Smith, its author, looked skep - tically at the mercantile policies of the European crowns, with their focus on accu - mulating silver and gold. But he also viewed the rising merchant class as suspect, not believing its unctuous claims to act in the public good. The Wealth of Nations is replete with contradictory ideas; in this, the book is a bit like the social and economic order that it would help shepherd into being. But by the late twentieth century, Smith's ideas would become fully adopt - ed by the right\u2014especially by libertarians and free-market conservatives. The full complexity of his thinking was reduced to the catchphrase \"the invisible hand,\" even though (as intellectual historian Emma Rothschild has noted) the words appeared just a few times in his entire corpus of work, and only once in The Wealth of Nations . Thanks to Milton Friedman\u2014who enjoyed sporting a necktie emblazoned with cameo portraits of Smith\u2014Smith's ideas became synonymous with free-market capitalism, even though, as many Smith scholars have observed, the thinker himself was much more ambivalent toward laissez-faire than Friedman would suggest. How did this happen? How did Smith's ideas become so thoroughly integrated into conservative defenses of the free market against regulation? And are these the only ways of reading his work? These are the questions at the heart of Adam Smith's America, Glory M. Liu's intriguing account of Smith's reception in the United States. Her capacious monograph demon - strates the variety of uses to which Smith's work has been put since its publication in the late eighteenth century, showing how politically contested readings of Smith always have been. In so doing, she illus - trates a broader point still: The vision of the free market that emerged in the late The Betrayal of Adam Smith How conservatives made him their icon and distorted his ideas By Kim Phillips-FeinILLUSTRATION BY MARK HARRIS65 Books & the Arts twentieth century is itself highly specific to our historical moment\u2014it was not the way that people (even economists) thought about economic life before and likely not the only way they will conceive of it in the future. THE WEALTH OF NATIONS was published in 1776, the same year the Colonies declared their independence, and many of those who sought to break from Britain were fa - miliar with Smith's work\u2014both Wealth and his earlier writing. As Liu shows, the first thinkers to make use of Smith in America were more inclined toward his musings about politics and psychology than any of his economic prescriptions. Nor did they in - terpret Smith in a way that narrowly aligned him with a particular political perspective. John Adams, most notably, drew on Smith to meditate on the political power of the rich. In an argument that echoes Smith's in The Theory of Moral Sentiments (his first major book), Adams suggested that there was a deep tendency in human psychology to defer to the wealthy and powerful and to treat them with an esteem that was unseemly for democratic citizens. Smith had warned that the poor man was \"ashamed of his poverty,\" while the rich man gloried in the \"attention of the world\" that his wealth conferred. This genuflec-tion, Adams insisted, was still present in the new republic. Wealth had a way (as Liu puts it) of transmuting itself into power even in a constitutional order that lacked an aristocracy. As the nineteenth century got under - way, more people emphasized Smith's economic thought. This made sense for a new nation: One of the underlying impli - cations of The Wealth of Nations was that countries were not rich or poor simply out of geographic luck, climate and resources, or divine reward; rather, how wealthy a nation was depended upon how it orga - nized labor\u2014on human will, ingenuity, and effort. But how to find the best arrange - ment to achieve this? Smith's ideas became heavily politicized in the contest between the slave South and the industrializing North. Although Smith had denounced the \"brutality\" of slavery, the planters of the South embraced him as the \"apostle of free trade,\" who supported the low tariffs that made it easier to sell their agricultur - al products\u2014while the new industrialists of the North sought protection to support their infant industries and accordingly were more skeptical of Smith.After the war, Adam Smith's name be - came a political shorthand, as though his work was (as one historian has put it) a \"gi- ant machine assembled to drive home one easily understood point\": the need to end tariffs and expand commercial freedom. Later in the nineteenth century, Smith's thought became a tool to critique dominant economic policy in the era of high tariffs and imperialist occupation leading to the Spanish-American War. \"In our legislation upon commercial matters, we have violated almost every precept that Adam Smith laid down for the guidance of men and nations,\" editorialized the New York Evening Post , following a celebration of the centenary of The Wealth of Nations. But the scripting of Smith into political debates about the merits of trade policy did not lead to lasting consensus about his significance. Reformist economists at the turn of the century looked at Smith and saw someone far more complex. Draw - ing from German historical economists, they turned American attention to what is known as \"Das Adam Smith Problem.\" In his early work, Smith had written that \"sympathy\"\u2014or the ability to identify with the pain and joy of others\u2014was among the \"original passions of human nature,\" and that \"the greatest ruffian, the most hard-ened violator of the laws of society, is not altogether without it.\" How could this be congruent with his argument in Wealth that \"self-love\"\u2014the \"propensity to truck, barter and exchange one thing for another\"\u2014 was what set humanity apart from other animals? As Smith put it, \"Nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for another with another dog.\" Self-interest was the defining principle of human nature, and the source for the immense division of labor that produced \"general opulence\" without anyone quite planning that it would do so. But how to reconcile self-interest with sympathy? For the economic thinkers of the ear - ly twentieth century, writing at a time of brutal and intense labor conflicts, what mattered was simply that Smith seemed to see both sides of the problem, and so he could offer a nuanced way of viewing economic issues that were frequently treat - ed in starkly opposing terms. Indeed, Liu suggests that even the first generation of \"Chicago School\" economists\u2014thinkers such as Jacob Viner and Frank Knight, who wrote in the 1920s and 1930s\u2014appreciated Smith's complexity. Knight and Vin - er turned to Smith as they sought ways to restore confidence in the free market and the price mechanism in response to the Great Depression. As Viner wrote in his essay \" adam smith and laissez faire,\" Smith saw a \"wide and elastic range of activity for government,\" believing that \"self-interest and competition were some - times treacherous to the public interest they were supposed to serve\"\u2014and that at times collective action might be in the interest of the social good. THESE READINGS OF Smith, though, disappeared with the emergence of the postwar Chicago School of Economics, led by Milton Friedman, Friedrich von Hayek, and George Stigler. These thinkers sought to establish economics as a science, saying that the hallmark of economic theory was building models and testing them with evidence to determine their predictive capacity. This had not been Smith's proj - ect, but they were drawn to Smith for his commitment to the idea of individual self- interest as the principle that underwrote the entire theory of the price mechanism. For them, as Stigler wrote, The Wealth of Nations was \"a stupendous palace erected upon the granite of self-interest.\" But the Chicago School thinkers pro - duced, Liu argues, a radically simplified version of Smith. Milton Friedman focused relentlessly on the image of the \"invisible hand,\" making the individualism and an- ti-statism it implied the cornerstone of his own philosophy. Friedman was wonder- struck by the vision of an economy that would regulate itself with no coordination from above, its constituent parts harmoniz - ing with no external conductor. This was at once a vision of social harmony and a Adam Smith's America: How a Scottish Philosopher Became an Icon of American Capitalism by Glory M. Liu Princeton University Press, 384 pp., $35.00 March 2023 66view that justified a profound skepticism of authority. Friedman embraced Smith as a \"radical and revolutionary in his time\u2014 just as those of us who preach laissez faire are in our time.\" For Friedman, Liu writes, Smith was an avatar and symbol of \"self-in - terest, choice and freedom.\" There was something kitschy about the right-wing appropriation of Smith, as the jowly profile of the eighteenth-century economist became a logo for the move - ment. Conservative activists printed Adam Smith neckties, while Stigler donned a homemade t-shirt: adam smith's best friend . The free-market organization Mont Pelerin Society traveled to Smith's birthplace in Kirkcaldy while in Scotland for its 1976 meeting, and conservatives named new think tanks for their icon, such as London's Adam Smith Institute. For the bicentennial of The Wealth of Na- tions , the Graduate Economics Association of M.I.T. held a roast at which they gave an \"Invisible Hand Award\" and sang a hymn celebrating Smith to the tune of \"Rock of Ages\": Hand invisible whose love We believe that we can prove!... Save us all from Marxist sins.Keep us gaily making pins! But despite the confidence of the Chica - go School, it has not had the last word on Smith. Just as the absolute vision of market primacy that it championed has come un - der increasing pressure in recent years, so, too, has its interpretation of Smith, assailed from both right and left. The last chapter of Adam Smith' s America explores a variety of recent scholarly and political challeng - es to the Chicago School reading of Smith. Neoconservatives Irving Kristol and Ger - trude Himmelfarb, for example, argued in the late 1970s and early '80s that it was reductive to emphasize Smith's ideas of self-interest to the exclusion of everything else; read properly, Smith believed that market society had to rely upon bourgeois norms and sensibilities\u2014a moral frame - work that the \"self-centered hedonism\" of capitalism undermined. Meanwhile, economic historian A.O. Hirschman argued that Smith's vision of self-interest was of a modified, humble, gentle passion, one that required taking into account the perceptions and reali - ty of others and was starkly opposed to naked greed or visions of domination\u2014 indeed, Hirschman suggested that Smith was among a generation of thinkers who thought the mild emotion of commercial self-interest could counter the more de - structive ambitions of imperial acquisition. On the left, intellectual historians such as Emma Rothschild have demolished the idea that Smith would ever have thought of the \"invisible hand\" absolutely dictating social life in the way that the price theo - rists indicate. Smith was first and foremost an Enlightenment thinker who sought to empower humanity to reshape and reimag - ine the world. The utopian rigor of market thought would have cut against his en - tire method and approach to social and economic life\u2014especially his democratic sensibilities, his feeling that there was no single order that could be imposed on all of society. LIU'S BOOK IS fascinating, and persua- sive, but she warns readers at the outset that her account is not comprehensive. Her aim has not been to capture every single mention of Smith in the centuries since he wrote, but rather to look at the devel - opment of influential schools of thought on Smith and the varying political uses to which his work has been put. Adam Smith' s America is a meditation on the nature of intellectual history: Do ideas reside in the original books, in the in - tent of authors? Or is what really matters how ideas have been used and reused, how thinkers come to the same texts with new questions that grow out of their own historical contexts? Yet because Liu's book is about how people have understood Smith\u2014not Smith himself\u2014readers who have not had the pleasure of reading Smith may find themselves a bit adrift. Liu demonstrates abundantly that the Chicago School read - ing of Smith dominated only briefly, and that Smith scholarship has to a great extent already left it behind. But it's necessary to look at Smith's central themes directly, not just at the debates around them, in order to Caryl Phillips's latest novel is A View of the Empire at Sunset.Emily Bront\u00eb\u2014The Tin Box by Caryl Phillips He gave the box to me for he considered this sister to be neither strange nor distant, but full of passions not expressed.

Smith had a deep and abiding dislike for nobility, aristocracy, and the leisured rich. In his view, these groups influenced state policy in ways that betrayed the larger in - terest. As historian Robert Heilbroner has proposed, material productivity was im - portant to Smith because it could occasion \"that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people.\" For Smith, the \"butcher, the brewer\" and \"the baker\" were the people who mattered. In the first chapter of The Wealth of Na - tions , Smith celebrated the globe-spanning coordination that goes into making a wool - en coat. \"The shepherd, the sorter of the wool, the wool-comber or carder, the dyer, the scribbler, the spinner, the weaver, the fuller, the dresser ... must all join their dif - ferent arts to complete even this homely production\"\u2014not to mention the mer - chants and carriers, the \"ship-builders, sailors, sail-makers, rope-makers\" who bring the ingredients of the dyes from \"the remotest corners of the world,\" the mak - ers of the spinning wheels and looms and even the humble shears to cut the wool from the sheep! All this glorious work and human effort went into making no luxury item, no royal robe, but the \"coarse and rough\" garments worn by a simple laborer. As this might suggest, Smith's impulses were egalitarian. The difference between \"a philosopher and a common street porter\" arose from \"habit, custom and education\" more than nature. In the first years of life, children were roughly all the same, and \"neither their parents nor playfellows\" could see much difference. He was also profoundly skeptical of elite actors, espe - cially those who claimed to be doing things for the public good. Employers, he warned, were always in a \"tacit, but uniform and constant, combination\" to lower the price of labor; masters and merchants frequent - ly sought to defraud the public to make a quick profit for themselves. Perhaps most surprising is that Smith was deeply concerned about the impli - cations of the very division of labor that he championed. Early in The Wealth of Nations , he described a pin factory. One person straightens the wire, another draws it out, someone else cuts it, yet another molds the head, and a different worker at - taches it. In this way, they could produce tens of thousands of pins in a single day, whereas a single worker doing all the steps alone could only make a few dozen. For Smith, the efficiency of specialization\u2014 both within a single factory, and on the order of the society as a whole\u2014was at the bedrock of the new social order; it was what led to the expansion of material wealth. But at the end of Wealth , Smith launches an attack on the very division of labor that he previously championed. It turns out that breaking down the task of pin-making into its constituent parts winds up creating a working life that is intoler-able. \"The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations ... becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become,\" he warns, insisting that such is the \"torpor of his mind\" that he can no longer engage in rational conversation, let alone come to any just judgment about even personal matters. In the \"barbarous societies,\" by contrast, \"invention is kept alive, and the mind is not suffered to fall into that drowsy stupidity\" that Smith thought character - ized the common people of his own day. Smith raises these points\u2014which in - vert almost perfectly the beginning of the book\u2014as he calls for \"government\" to do something to stop this course of events, by making education available to all. He ups the ante to appeal to conservatives inter- ested in preserving social stability as he suggests that, without general education, the nation will eventually no longer be able to produce people who are fit for the military, implying that the restive, stupid masses may be unusually susceptible to political manipulation and even rebellion. However, it's hard to read this passage with - out wondering: Is education adequate? Will literate pinmakers be content screwing on the heads? Can public education really re - dress the numb emptiness instilled by the division of labor? How can the problems Smith describes really be resolved? Smith felt no obligation to answer these questions, or to present a seamless and consistent account of the new economic sensibility he described. He was content to note the contradictions and allow them to exist. This has, of course, allowed genera - tions of thinkers to read and use Smith in their own ways, to seek what they want to in his work, to emphasize some parts and downplay others. Reading Smith against the grain of the conventional wisdom is exciting precisely because he has been so thoroughly claimed by the right. But at the same time, he can't simply be adopted by the left. In numerous ways, Smith seems to embody many of the tensions within capitalism itself\u2014its roots in rebellion, its obsession with social order and property, its simultaneous extension of freedom and of suppression. He observed and docu - mented the spirit of a new world that was coming into existence. As Liu's rich account demonstrates, we cannot know what he would have made of that new order once it had ossified, as it has today.

The \"butcher, the brewer\" and \"the baker\" were the people who mattered. March 2023 68 Res Publica by Win McCormack The Fight Ahead On my third visit with the political philosopher Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, we reconnoitered at the Ristorante Machiavelli, an eatery on a hillside in Seattle, Washington, on a day when it was closed for normal business. When he arrived, I greeted Niccol\u00f2 with a hearty \"ciao.\" \"Grazie, mio amico , \" Niccol\u00f2 replied. \"But you know, back in my day, we did not have this word 'ciao.' So, I will greet you with the more customary buongiorno.\" \"Buongiorno, Niccol\u00f2. I was just reflecting on the fact that you are considered by many scholars to be the greatest pioneer of modern political thought.\" \"Yes, I know that is the case,\" Niccol\u00f2 said. \"But I would be too modest to make that claim. There were others thinking along the same lines as I in that period, in Florence especially. Thinkers aware that you had to analyze politics from a real - istic and not an idealistic point of view.\" \"Yes, but it is principally your works from that time, The Prince and The Discourses, that we study. One of America's founders, James Madison, said that if men were good, there would be no need for government!\" \"Yes, I know that your founders were familiar with my works, especially John Adams, and adopted a primitive version of my proposal for mixed government, which the Roman sage Polybi - us had pioneered before me. The great Aristotle distinguished among three distinct forms of government\u2014monarchy, or rule by a single individual or king; aristocracy, or rule by a privileged but responsible upper class; and democracy, rule by the masses. And each of these forms of government, he pointed out, has a good form and a bad form\u2014a king can turn into a tyrant, an ar - istocracy can evolve into a self-serving oligarchy, and the masses can become a rampaging mob. So Polybius originated the idea of combining all three, which I advocated in turn in my era.\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"and the founders thought of themselves as creat - ing a modern version of that scheme. The president of the nation would be a facsimile of a king, but constrained by two differing legislative bodies, an elitist Senate with terms of service lasting six years and a more plebian House of Representatives elected every two years. And below the national level, there would be subordinate units with their own powers of self-government. One of the powers the states were given in the American Constitution was supervision of elections, both local and national.\"\"Alora ,\" Niccol\u00f2 said, \"this, I think, brings us to the elections that were pending at the time of our two previous meetings. How did that go? You were fearing the worst.\" \"The results were mixed,\" I responded, \"but for the most part much better than expected. Usually in the midterms the presi - dent's political party loses a disproportionate number of seats in the Senate and House. The current president, Joe Biden, a Democrat, was not high at the time in public esteem, so it was expected that his political party would not do well. News com - mentators, as well as Republican talking heads, were predicting a 'red wave,' red being the color associated with Republicans, while blue is associated with Democrats. But there was no red wave. There wasn't anything even close to one. Democrats maintained control of the U.S. Senate and increased their margin there by a small amount. U.S. Senate candidates in Georgia and Pennsylva - nia personally chosen by Donald Trump lost their races, as did his candidate for governor of Pennsylvania, who received only 42 percent of the vote. Republicans won control of the House of Representatives, but by only a small margin. Best of all, Repub - lican 'election deniers' who ran for statewide offices, such as secretary of state and governor, that control the elections process in key states, failed to win their races.\" \"Mi hai perso!\" Niccol\u00f2 an 'election denier'?\" \"Ex-President Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, but refused to concede to Joe Biden and mounted an effort\u2014which he still has not abandoned\u2014to nulli- fy Biden's victory. He plans to run again, and these election deniers, if they had secured those offices, would have helped him to be declared the victor in their states, whether he actually won the most votes or not. He represents, in other words, the first serious attempt in American history to transform the presidency into a monarchy, and he still has not abandoned that quest. In fact, he has advocated termination of the American Constitution.\" Niccol\u00f2 riposted: \"During our conversation in the early fall, we discussed the aspect of Roman civilization that in my view enabled the Romans to become the dominant power in the Mediterranean world\u2014 the amount of freedom vouchsafed to Roman citizens prior to the advent of the empire. And I noted that America, for all the faults it might have, has achieved the greatest degree of freedom in the modern world, and that its freedom now seemed threatened by the forces of reaction. And I explained that, for the Romans, having Fortuna, or the goddess of luck, on your side was cru - cial, and possessing the quality of virt\u00f9 , or strength of character, which the goddess admires, was crucial in that regard. It seems that all these matters are going well for you and the democratic forces in America.\" \"Niccol\u00f2, that is not something we can count on. I have done some research and learned that there was also a Roman goddess of treachery and fraud named Fraus\u2014our word 'fraud' derives from it. Our current Republican Party is a fraudulent organization that has no interest in fostering a community of self-governing people, as republican philosophy calls for. Rather, as we have dis - cussed, it is bent on weakening democracy in the United States if not doing away with it completely. There is a long struggle ahead.
