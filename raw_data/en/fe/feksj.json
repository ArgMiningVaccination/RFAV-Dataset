CPDMS.net was developed by the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) to provide individual hospitals with the ability to monitor the type of cancer patients seen in the h ospital, the extent of disease at diagnosis, the type of diagnostic procedures used and the type of therapy provided. CPDMS.net enables hospital registries to follow cancer patients over time. Data on all known medical intervention and the health status of each patient can be periodically recorded using CPDMS.net. These data allow individual hospitals to examine both the use of various diagnostic and therapeutic resources as well as the potential effect of these resources on patient survival. C PDMS.net is designed for independent and autonomous use by individual health care facilities. However, a central repository of data on all cancer patients diagnosed and treated in Kentucky has been established in the Kentucky Cancer Registry. This central data base allows for the calculation and publication of cancer incidence rates for the entire state of Kentucky, as well as for smaller geographic regions within the state. CPDMS.net includes complete documentation. This abstractor's manual des cribes each data item which will be collected and precise instruction regarding how the information is to be coded. The abstractor's manual also contains a picture of the data entry screens. In addition, a CPDMS.net operator's manual has been developed. The operator's manual contains step -by-step instructions for performing each function of this registry software. CPDMS.net is a valuable tool for any hospital wishing to develop and maintain a high quality cancer care program. The application mee ts all of the requirements for an American College of Surgeons approved cancer program and all of the requirements for the National Cancer Institute's SEER Program. Data system coordinators are available through the KCR to assist hospitals using CPDMS.net in setting up their registry, training personnel, abstracting data and analyzing the information. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 2 COMPUTERIZED RECORD STRUCTURE CPDMS.net is a fully relational database designed in a modular fashion. Each patient record has a unique identification number internally generated by the computer which links all information stored about that patient. Patient identification information occurs only once in the patient record. Attached to the patient record is a file containing ten optional, user -defined fields for patient level data. Each patient may have more than one primary malignancy, or case. These are identified by the primary sequence number and site group code. Those c ases which are reportable by your hospital will also have segments of the record containing diagnosis and staging information, as well as follow up data. These data items will occur only once in a case record. Attached to the case record are segments containing therapy and open text data. The therapy segments may be repeated as often as necessary to record all the appropriate information about a case. Additionally, there are record segments which contain hospital -specific identifiers for each case. Twenty optional, user -defined fields are available for each case record. For further information regarding CPDMS.net, please refer to the Operator's Manual. Introduction 3 CASE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS CASES TO BE REPORTED: All cases of primary malignant disease diagnosed or treated at a Kentucky health care facility on or after January 1, 1991, should be reported to the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR). These are usually described by the terms: carcinoma, sarcom a, melanoma, leukemia, or lymphoma. Reportable and classified by ICD -O Topography, Morphology, and behavior codes. Only in- situ and malignant neoplasms are reportable (behavior codes 2 and 3); benign, borderline, and metastatic tumors are not reportable to the KCR, except as noted below. However, i f a term is used which usually has a behavior code of '0' or '1', but is verified by a pathologist as in -situ or malignant (behavior code 2 or 3), these cases are reportable. THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS to this are: Neoplasms of the skin (ICD -O Topogr aphy to C44.9) with the codes neoplasms of the skin NOTE: Localized basal and squamous cell skin cancers greater than 5 cm at diagnosis, as well as those diagnosed at a regional or distant stage, used to be required by ACoS for approved hospitals prior to 2003. They are not req uired to be reported to KCR or to ACoS, after January 1, 2003. Cases of intraepithelial neoplasia, Grade III, of the cervix or prostate (M - 8077/2). These are often designated by terms such as CIN III or PIN III. These cases are not required to be abstracted or reported. Any carcinoma in -situ of the cervix is not to be reported to KCR, as of January 1, 1998. This includes all types of malignancies with a topography code of C53 and a behavior code of 2. Pilocytic astrocytoma (C71.__, M -9421/1) is required to be reported as a malignant brain tumor with 9421/3. As of January 1, 2004, the following non- malignant primary intracranial and central nervous system tumors with a behavior code of /0 or /1 (benign and borderli ne, or \"non- malignant\") are required to be reported, regardless of histologic type, for these ICD -O-3 topography codes. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 4 Table 1. Topography Codes for Benign Brain Tumors Codes Description C70.0 Nerves and Other Parts of the Central Nervous System Spinal cord Cauda equina Olfactory nerve Optic nerve Acoustic nerve Cranial nerve, NOS Overlapping lesion of brain and central nervous system Nervous system, NOS C75.1 C75.2 C75.3 Other are not reportable. NOTE: For non -malignant primary intracranial and central nervous system tumors (C70.0 - C72.9, C75.1 - C75.3), the terms \"tumor\" and \"neoplasm\" are considered diagnostic for the purpose of case reporting, in addition to the terms generally applicable to malignant tumors. PATIENTS TO BE REPORTED: All patients first seen and/or treated at each Kentucky hospital after January 1, 1991 for a diagn osis of cancer should be reported to the Kentucky Cancer Registry. This includes inpatient Introduction 5 admissions and patients seen in ambulatory care settings that are hospital affiliated. It includes all clinical diagnoses of cancer, whether histologically confirmed or not. It also includes patients diagnosed as autopsy. As of January 1, 1995, all patients seen or treated in any licensed health facility in the state, which provides diagnostic or treatment services to cancer patients, shall report cases to the Kentu cky Cancer Registry. Physicians in private practice should report any cases of cancer diagnosed or treated in their offices which are not otherwise reported to KCR by another health care facility. PATIENTS NOT REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED BY HOSPITALS: 1. Patients who are seen only in consultation to confirm a cancer diagnosis or treatment plan, and no treatment was provided by your facility. EXAMPLE: An outpatient CT scan of the chest reads: probable carcinoma of the right lung. The patient does not return to your institution for diagnostic confirmation or treatment. Send these and specimen only pathology reports with face sheet to KCR. EXAMPLE: Patient comes to your institution for a second opinion. Staff physicians order diagnostic tests. The phy sicians support the original treatment plan. Patient returns to the other institution for treatment. 2. Patients who receive transient care to avoid interrupting a course of therapy initiated elsewhere, for example, while vacationing, or because o f equipment failure at the original hospital. 3. Patients whose medical chart indicates a history of cancer only, and who were diagnosed prior to 1991. 4. Patients with in -situ or localized neoplasms of the skin (as listed above). 5. Patients with preinvasive neoplasia of the cervix (as listed above). TIME FRAME FOR REPORTING: Cases must be reported to the KCR within 6 months from the date of initial diagnosis or date first seen at the reporting facility if not diagnosed there. For those patients seen on an outpatient basis only, the outpatient visit date is considered the date of discharge. CLASSES OF CASES: The class of case codes as defined by the American College of Surgeons in their Facility Oncology Registry Data Standa rds (FORDS) manual, describe categories, or classes, of cases based on the type of service provided to the patient by the reporting facility. The class, in turn, determines how the case is to be reported. The reporting requirements of the Kentucky Cancer 2009 Abstractor's Manual 6 Registry may differ from those of the American College of Surgeons. For a discussion of ACoS requirements, refer to the FORDS manual. CLASS DESCRIPTION 0 Patients diagnosed at your hospital since your reference date and receive all first cou rse of therapy elsewhere. 1 Patients first diagnosed and first treated at your facility. Patients who receive no initial therapy or who are not treatable or who receive palliative care only should also be included here. Cases diagnosed in a sta ff physician's office involving patients who were referred to your hospital for definitive treatment must be included in the registry as though first diagnosed at your hospital. Likewise, if the case is diagnosed in your hospital and the patient receives all of his initial treatment in the staff physician's office, this therapy should be considered as rendered at your facility. 2 Patients first diagnosed elsewhere and all or part of first course of therapy was administered at your facility. Patients first diagnosed elsewhere and palliative care in lieu of, or as part of, first course therapy was administered at your facility. 3 Patients diagnosed and all of first course of therapy received elsewhere; receiving subsequent therapy at yo ur facility. 4 Patients diagnosed and treated at your hospital prior to your reference date; and receiving subsequent treatment at your hospital after your reference date. 5 Patients diagnosed at autopsy. 8 Patients abst racted by Death Certificate (for central registry use only). 9 Patients seen only in a nonhospital facility (for central registry use only). X Patients reported to KCR through out -of-state data exchange agreements (for central regist ry use only). THERAPY - FIRST AND SUBSEQUENT COURSE First course of therapy includes any and all procedures or treatments planned by the managing physician(s), and administered during or after the first clinical diagnosis of cancer. Treatment usually m odifies, controls, removes, or destroys proliferating cancer tissue, whether primary or metastatic, regardless of the patient's response. First course may include multiple modes of therapy, and may encompass intervals of a year or more. No therapy is a t reatment option that occurs if the patient or family refuses treatment, or the patient dies before treatment starts, or the physician recommends \"watchful waiting\" or no treatment be given. When a treatment plan is not available, evaluate the therapy and the time it started. If the therapy is a part of an established protocol or within accepted management guidelines for the disease, it is first course of therapy. Consult the attending physician or registry's physician advisor if protocols or management guidelines are not available. If there is no treatment plan, established protocol, or management guidelines, and you cannot consult with a physician, use the principle: \"initial treatment must begin within four months of Introduction 7 the date of initial diagnosis.\" All other cancer -directed therapy that begins within four months of the date of the initial treatment would be first course of therapy. INFORMATION TO BE REPORTED TO KCR: Cases in classes 0, 1, 2, and 5 must be fully abs tracted in CPDMS.net. All mandatory data elements must be filled in. Detailed instructions for completing the Abstract Form can be found in this manual. These cases must also be followed annually throughout the life of the patient. A comprehensive method to identify and track patients must be implemented by the reporting hospital. The follow up information that is required to be reported is shown on the CPDMS Follow up Form. The only exceptions to the follow up requirements are people residing in foreign countries and patients with carcinoma in situ of the cervix. These two categories of patients are not required to be followed, regardless of class of case. The ACoS does not require CoC approved hospitals to follow patients over 100 years of age or patient s who are class 0 if diagnosed after January 1 st, 2006. However, KCR requires Kentucky hospitals to follow all patients who are class 0, 1, 2, regardless of age. Prior to 2000, cases in Class 3 must be reported to KCR. Effective with 2000 diagnoses, you have an option in reporting class 3 cases to KCR. You may choose to continue abstracting these cases, or you may choose to send the case information to KCR for abstraction. If you choose to forward the case to KCR, you are still required to send all appl icable case information to KCR in a timely manner! Cases in Class 4 are not required to be reported to the Kentucky Cancer Registry. Abstracting a CPDMS Abstract From and lifetime follow up are entirely optional. Cases in Class 8 are those discovered t hrough death certificate files only. KCR staff will abstract these cases. Cases in Class 9 are nonhospital facility cases. NOTE ***If your hospital has an outpatient radiology diagnosis or has read an outside pathology report diagnosing cancer, these are not reportable by your facility. However, information regarding the diagnosis MUST be sent to KCR central office staff. KCR staff will abstract these cases. Cases designated Class X are those reported to KCR through out -of-state data exchange agreements . TIME FRAME FOR REPORTING FOLLOW -UP INFORMATION: Current follow -up information must be reported to KCR for each case diagnosed since 1995 that is class 0, 1, or 2. Follow -up information is considered current if the date of last contact with the patie nt is within 15 months of the current date. CPDMS.net can generate reports which identify patients who require updated follow -up information. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 8 CASEFINDING All participating institutions should establish procedures for complete casefinding within their institution. In many hospitals, records are housed in one location, i.e., medical records department. In others, procedures for identifying patients from multiple independent ancillary service areas may be necessary, i.e., outpatient clinics, radiation therapy, etc. It is important that the following multiple sources in the hospital be searched to keep missed reportable cases to a minimum. The procedures outlined below should be adapted to each individual hospital. 1. Me dical record disease discharge diagnostic index: Any patient record coded with the diagnoses listed below should be reviewed to determine if the case is one which meets KCR reportability criteria: 225.0 225.9 neoplasms of brain and - 227.4 Benign Carcinoma 237.9 Neoplasm of uncertain behavior [borderline] Personal history of malignancy (review these for recurrences, subsequent primaries, and/or subsequent treatment) This procedure is imperative to assure that no cases have been missed, including those originally diagnosed by clinical methods only. A list of supplemental ICD -9-CM codes which may also be used for casefinding is available in Appendix N . 2. Pathology reports: All pathology reports on both inpatients and outpatients should be reviewed for case reportability. Since most cancer patients have a biopsy or operative resection performed, nearly all of the reportable cases can be identified through pathology reports alone. Histologic diagnoses are based upon microscopic examination of tissue taken from such procedures as biopsy, frozen section, surgery, or D & C. Expand path report screening to include benign CNS tumors, beginning with 1 -1-04 diagnoses. Check for cases of anal intraepithelial neoplasia, grade III (AIN III), ductal intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (DIN 3), vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia, grade III (VAIN III), and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, grade III (VIN III). NOTE: Path reports may be the best source for finding cases of VIN, VAIN, and AIN (8077/2) and DIN (8500/2). 3. Cytology reports: All cytology reports for both inpatients and outpatients should be reviewed for case report ability. Cytologic diagnoses are based upon microscopic examination of cells as contrasted with tissues. Included are nal fluid, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, and urinary sediment. Cervical and vaginal smears are common examples. 4. Autopsy reports. 5. Radiation Therapy Department logs. 6. Medical Oncology Department logs. 7. Outpatient Department: New patient registration rosters, clinic appointment books, surgery schedules, diagnostic imaging, and billing departments are additional casefinding sources. 8. Alpha listing of previously included cases: 2009 Abstractor's Manual 10 Casefinding cannot be considered complete until t he CPDMS accession list and any previous registry accession lists have been checked to be sure that this is a new patient or a new primary. Creating and Maintaining a Nonreportable List In the course of routine casefinding activities, cases which are f ound to be nonreportable by your hospital should be added to a nonreportable list. The list should consist of each patient's name, DOB, SSN, medical record number, the type/site of cancer, and a brief explanation of why the case is not reportable to the h ospital registry (i.e., \"patient was seen for consult only, no dx or tx,\" or \"patient originally diagnosed prior to reference date\"). A well -maintained nonreportable list will save registrars time by preventing them from reviewing a chart multiple times to check on a particular primary that does not need to be abstracted. The list can be invaluable during casefinding audits by allowing quick resolution of possible missed cases. It is also helpful during the death clearance procedure. Bear in mind that cases which are not reportable by your hospital, but which ARE reportable to KCR (see Case Reporting Requirements ) should be sent to the central registry to be abstracted there. These may include: A specimen from an outside doctor's office which was sent to your hospital's path lab An outpatient scan that was diagnostic, but no further confirmation was made at your hospital Any case that was diagnosed and/or treated only in a nonhospital facili ty A Kentucky resident who was initially diagnosed or treated out of state Introduction 11 GENERAL PRINCIPLES IN CODING CASES TO INCLUDE IN THE REGISTRY According to the Reporting Requirements, all cases of prim ary malignant disease diagnosed or treated at a Kentucky hospital on or after January 1, 1991 are required to be included. These are usually described by the terms: carcinomas, sarcomas, melanomas, leukemias, and lymphomas. The primary reference book which lists all malignant diseases is the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD -O), third edition. In addition to providing a list of all morphologies considered to be malignant (or cancerous), the ICD -O book also contains cell behavior cod es: 0=benign, malignancy, 2=in- situ, 3=malignant unknown if primary or metastatic. All malignancies with a behavior code of 2 or 3 in ICD -O, 3rd edition, should be included in the registry, exc ept specified neoplasms of the skin and preinvasive cervical neoplasia, as described on page 2. Benign and borderline CNS tumors diagnosed on or after January 1, 2004 are required to be reported. Other benign tumors and borderline malignancies (behavior codes 0 and 1) may be listed in the registry in a separate accession register. They should not be entered into CPDMS.net. These diagnoses are referred to as \"reportable -by-agreement\" cases. Metastatic tumors and tumors that are unknown if primary or metastatic (behavior codes 6 and 9) are indicative of a primary malignancy of an unknown site. These cases should be reported with the primary site coded as \"unknown primary\" (topography code of C80.9) and the appropriate morphology code with a behavior code of /3. 1. Inconclusive diagnostic terms Occasionally the diagnosis contains vague or inconclusive terms, such as probable carcinoma of the lung. The following terms are considered to be diagnostic of cancer if they modify a term such as malignancy or carcinoma: apparent(ly) appears to compatible with comparable with consistent with favor(s) likely malignant appearing most likely presumed probable suspect(ed) 2009 Abstractor's Manual 12 suspicious typical of EXCEPTION: If a cytology report says \"suspicious,\" do not interpret it as a diagnosis of cancer. Abstract the case only if a positive biopsy or a physician's clinical impression of cancer supports the cytology. The diagnosis date is date of supporting documentation - either physician statement or positive biopsy. Any other ambiguous terminology regarding the diagnosis of a malignancy is not to be interpreted as diagnostic of cancer. Some examples are: cannot be ruled out equivocal lump lytic lesion (on x -ray) mass neoplasm* nodule possible potentially malignant questionable rule out suggests tumor* worrisome For example, a diagnosis of probable carcinoma of the left lung would be abstracted as a lung primary. A possible carcinoma is not reportable. *EXCEPTION: For benign and borderline brain and CNS tumors, t he terms \"tumor\" and \"neoplasm\" will be considered diagnostic of a reportable disease. 2. Changing the diagnosis Over time, information may be added to the patient's medical chart that was missing or ambiguous in the original record. It is the practic e to accept the thinking and information about the case based on the latest or most complete information. Thus, it is acceptable to change the primary site and histology as information becomes more complete. However, information about the SEER Summary Stag e and extent of disease at diagnosis may only be changed as long as the new information reflects the time period within four months of the date of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression or through first course surgeries, whichever is longer. There may be cases reported originally as cancer with the ambiguous terms listed previously, which later information indicates never were malignancies. These Introduction 13 cases must be deleted from the file, and the sequence number of any remaining cases for the same pers on adjusted accordingly. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 14 STAGING SYSTEMS 1. AJCC Staging The American College of Surgeons (ACoS) Commission on Cancer has required that all approved programs must TNM stage all sites contained in the AJCC Manual for Staging of Cancer since January 1, 1991. Effective with 1995 cases, all cancers must be staged by the managing physician or by residents or fellows and cosigned by a faculty or attending physician. Clinical extent of disease is based on information and evidence accumulated before cancer -directed treatment. It is based on the physical examination, imaging, endoscopy, biopsy, surgical exploration, and other relevant findings. Clinical classification is appropriate for sites accessible for clinical exam ination. Use clinical classification when an organ does not have a pathologic evaluation. Pathologic extent of disease is based on information gathered before cancer -directed treatment, as well as evidence gathered from surgery and pathological examinati on of the resected specimen. Pathologic extent of disease is a combination of all findings through first course of surgery, or 4 months, whichever is longer, in the absence of disease progression. 2. SEER Summary Stage 2000 The Commission on Cancer al so requires Summary Staging for any and all sites not included or not appropriate for AJCC TNM staging. The Kentucky Cancer Registry required Summary Staging 1977 on all cases diagnosed prior to January 1, 2001. On January 1, 2001, the SEER Summary Stage 2 000 coding scheme was implemented. This field will be calculated from the data values entered in the SEER Extent of Disease fields, so it does not have to be manually coded. Extent of disease is limited to all information available through completion of first course surgery(ies) or within four months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, whichever is longer. Summary Stage for all sites is based on pathological, operative, and clinical assessments. The priority for using these reports is: -Pathologic -Operative (Particularly important when the surgical procedure does not remove all malignant tissue) -Clinical 3. SEER Extent of Disease (EOD) Introduction 15 For cases diagnosed from January 2000 to December 2003, the Kentucky Cancer Registry requires SEER Extent of Disease coding. Extent of Disease should include all information available through completion of surgery(ies) in first course treatment or within four months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, whichever is longer. For all sites, extent of disease is based on a combined clinical and operative/pathological assessment. Use the SEER Extent of Disease Coding Manual, Third Edition (1998) to determine the code values for these fields. 4. Collaborative Staging Collaborative Staging (CS) is to be used for cases diagnosed on or after January 1, 2004. It is not to be used for cases diagnosed prior to that date. Its introduction does not affect CoC requirements for physicians to assign AJCC staging or the requirement that the physician - assigned staging values be recorded in the registry. With Collaborative Staging, registrars code discrete pieces of information once and the CS computer algorithm derives the values for AJCC T, N, M and Stage Group, Summary Stage 1977, and Summary Stage 2000. The derived stage codes are ideally suited for data analysis because of the consistency that can be obtained with objectively -recorded, identically -processed data items. The timing rule for CS coding was designed to make use of the most complete information possible to yield the \"best stage\" information for the tumor at the time of diagnosis - \"use all information gathered through completion of surgery(ies) in first course of treatment or all information available within four months of the date of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, whichever is longer .\" Disease progression is defined as further direct extension or distant metastasis known to have developed after the diagnosis was established. Information about tumor extension, lymph node involvement, or distant metastasis obtained after disease progression is documented, should be excluded from the CS coding. Fifteen CS data items are coded by the registrar. The CS algorithm produces the output items listed as deriv ed fields. The derived AJCC items are separate from the physician -coded items; and the derived Summary Stage items are separate from the manually -coded items collected by the CoC in the past. The derived items cannot be manually altered. Like the AJCC an d Summary Stage codes that are derived from it, CS is a site -specific staging system. The CS algorithm uses tumor site and histology to determine which CS schema to apply. Depending on the schema, the coding instructions and code definitions will vary. Col laborative Staging codes are defined for every site and histology combination. The AJCC Cancer Staging Manual does not cover all sites, and some histologies are excluded from sites with an AJCC coding scheme. When the CS algorithm processes a site -histolog y combination that does not have an applicable AJCC code, it assigns the display string \"NA\" for \"Not applicable.\" A blank display string for a derived item means the CS algorithm was not run for the case. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 16 The complete instructions and site -histology def ined codes are available in the Collaborative Staging Manual and Coding Instructions (CS Manual) version 01.03.00. Part I provides general instructions and the instructions and codes for generic (non site -specific) items. Part II contains the site -specific instructions and codes. The CS Manual and related information is available electronically on the AJCC Web site at http://www.cancerstaging.org/cstage/manuals.html . Introduction 17 FIRST COURSE OF THERAPY 1. Treatment Plan A treatment plan describes the type(s) of treatment(s) intended to modify or control the malignancy. The documentation confirming a treatment plan may be fragmented. It is frequently found in several different sources, i.e., medical record, clinic record, consultation reports, and outpatient records. All cancer -directed treatments specified in the physician(s) treatment plan are a part of the first course of therapy. A treatment plan may spe cify only one method of treatment (i.e., surgery) or any combination of therapies (i.e., surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, or other therapy). A single regimen includes the combination of concurrent or adjuvant treatm ents. All treatments specified in the treatment plan and delivered to the patient are first course of therapy. 2. Time Period All Malignancies Except Leukemia First course of therapy includes all cancer -directed treatment planned by the physician(s) during or after the first diagnosis of cancer. Planned treatment may include multiple modes of therapy, and may encompass intervals of a year or more. No treatment may be a planned treatment option; therefore, first course of therapy may be No treatment. When a treatment plan is not available, evaluate the therapy and the time it started. If the therapy is a part of an established protocol or within accepted management guidelines for the disease, it is first course of therapy. Consult the attending physician or registry's physician advisor if protocols or management guidelines are not available. If there is no treatment plan, established protocol, or management guidelines, and you cannot consult with a physician, use the princi ple: \"first course treatment must begin within four months of the date of initial diagnosis.\" Any treatment given after four months is subsequent treatment. Treatment failure or disease progression may prompt the physician to stop therapy before the full course has been completed. Record any treatments administered after the discontinuation of first course as secondary or subsequent therapy only . If there is no documentation of a treatment plan, a progression, recurrence, or treatment failure, first cours e ends four months after diagnosis date. Any treatment given after four months is second course treatment in the absence of a documented treatment plan or therapy standard. Leukemia 2009 Abstractor's Manual 18 Treatment for leukemia is divided into three phase s: remission induction, consolidation, and maintenance. Remission induction is initial intensive chemotherapy and/or biological response modifiers. Consolidation is repetitive cycles of chemotherapy and/or irradiation to the brain, given immediately after remission. Maintenance is chemotherapy given for a period of months or even years to maintain remission. Code all therapy that is remission induction, consolidation or maintenance as first course. Do not record treatment that is given after a patient relap ses. Some patients do not have a remission. If a patient does not have a remission, record the treatment given in the first attempt to induce a remission. Do not record treatment administered as a change in the original treatment plan. 3. De finitive Treatment Definitive treatment usually modifies, controls, removes, or destroys proliferating cancer tissue. Treatment may be directed toward either the primary or metastatic sites. Physicians administer the treatment(s) to minimize the size of tumor, or to delay the spread of disease. NOTE: Only definitive therapy should be included in statistical analyses of treatment. Surgical codes 00 -07, and Other treatment code 0 must be excluded. These codes are not considered definitive therapy. Palliative treatment is treatment that improves the patient's quality of life by preventing or relieving suffering. Palliative therapy may include definitive treatment procedures as well as non -definitive patient care procedures. For example : The patient was diagnosed with stage IV cancer of the prostate with painful bony metastases. The patient starts radiation treatment intended to shrink the tumor in the bone and relieve the intense pain. The radiation treatments are palliative because the y relieve the bone pain; the radiation is also first course of therapy because it destroys proliferating cancer tissue. Record any palliative treatment that modifies or destroys cancer tissue as first course therapy. 4. Non -Definitive Treatment (Non -treatment patient care procedures) Non-definitive treatments prolong the patient's life, make the patient comfortable, or prepare the patient for definitive therapy. These treatments are not tumor directed. They are not meant to reduce the size of the tumor or delay the spread of disease. Non - definitive procedures include diagnostic procedures and supportive care (treatments designed to relieve symptoms and minimize the effects of the cancer). Non -definitive therapies are generally not used in statistical analysis of treatment. EXAMPLES: Surgical procedures: Incisional biopsies Exploratory procedures with or without biopsies Introduction 19 Supportive care/relieving symptoms: Palliative care, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy for symptom relief only Pain medication Oxygen Antibiotics administered for an associated infection Transfusions* Intravenous the rapy to maintain fluid or nutritional balance Laser therapy directed at relieving symptoms *NOTE : Coding Treatment for Hematopoietic Diseases: For many of the newly reportable hematopoietic diseases, the principal treatment is either sup portive care, observation, or another type of treatment that does not meet the usual definition that treatment \"modifies, controls, removes or destroys proliferating cancer tissue.\" Such treatments include phlebotomy, transfusions, aspirin, supportive care and observation. In order to document that patients with hematopoietic diseases did have some medical treatment, SEER and the Commission on Cancer have agreed to record these treatments as First Course \"Other Treatment\" (code 1) for the hematopoietic dise ases ONLY. A complete description of the treatment plan should be recorded in the text field for \"Other Treatment\" on the abstract. For more details, see Appendix K . 2009 Abstractor's Manual 20 FOLLOW-UP POLICY AND PROCEDURES I. Definition A. Follow -up of cancer patients is the systematic process of obtaining accurate information at least annually, on the patient's health, vital status, a nd progression of disease. Follow -up information is extremely important for the following reasons: 1. To assist in the early identification of the recurrence of a cancer. 2. To assist the physician in getting former cancer patients to return for scheduled treatments and/or checkups. 3. To insure periodic examinations of former cancer patients since they are prone to develop other cancers. 4. To gather information so physicians can review various types of treatment in terms of survival. B. Follow -up information mus t be sought on analytic cases only (classes 0, 1, and 2), with the following exceptions: 1. Patients who are currently residing in foreign countries (New in NAACCR) 2. Patients whose only malignancy is carcinoma in situ of the cervix These are not required to be followed, regardless of the class of the case. C. Follow -up is considered delinquent by the American College of Surgeons (ACoS) if the information is not successfully obtained and documented within 15 months of the patient's previous date of last contact. A successful follow -up rate of 90% of a hospital's analytic cases is considered in compliance with ACoS standards for an approved Cancer Program. It is best to maintain the highest follow -up rate possible; survival rates and other valuable statistical analyses are heavily dependent on accurate and timely follow -up information. II. Follow -up information to be collected includes: A. The date of last contact. This is either the date of death or the most current date the patient was known to be alive. B. Survival status. This indicates whether the patient is alive (with or without disease) or dead (from causes related or unrelated to cancer). C. Present address of patient, if different from that originally recorded. D. Disease Status. This is informatio n about whether the patient was ever disease free, and if so, the start date of the disease free interval. E. Recurrence information. This includes the date of first recurrence, the type of first recurrence, and the site(s) of first recurrence. F. Additional treatment received. This includes the type(s) and date(s) of therapy given after the last date of last contact. G. If dead, cause of death. This includes any autopsy information available on this patient. H. Method of obtaining follow -up information. This includes any change in the name or address of the primary or alternate contact persons or in the method for pursuing follow -up on the next attempt. III. Procedures Introduction 21 A. A computerized list of all patients in the tumor registry for whom no contact has be en recorded in the last 12 months can be generated. B. All cancer registries, even the smallest, need form letters, particularly to make physician contact. All form letters should be printed or photocopied onto hospital letterhead and should have the cor rect phone number, including extension, for the staff contact person. Be sure there is ample space to insert names, addresses, and any additional information about the patient on the form. The information request form for physicians requires a great deal of care in design. You must provide adequate information: the full name of the patient, the diagnosis clearly stated, and the date of your latest information. The data items you request must be arranged in a logical sequence and must be easily recorded. If you must secure physician permission to contact a patient, include that request on the form. C. It is customary in most registries to obtain physician permission to contact patients directly when contact through that physician is not possible. This permis sion may be obtained in several ways: 1. Blanket permission may be granted by action of the medical staff. 2. In some hospitals, blanket permission to contact patients is not granted for any number of reasons. It then becomes necessary to obtain permission on a case by case basis. D. Follow -up information on all patients named on the follow -up control list should be pursued in an orderly and stepwise fashion: 1. Pull and review charts or any internal lists which would indicate these patients' vital status and/or dis ease status. 2. Identify any patients who have returned to this hospital and record the most current date of last contact. Review these charts for any other follow -up information related to the patient's cancer progression or treatment and update the patient' s record in CPDMS.net. 3. Send letters to the primary following physician designated for the patients remaining on the list. Labels will be generated by CPDMS.net to the appropriate contact person for each patient needing follow - up. 4. When letters are return ed with current information about your cancer patients, update the patient's record in CPDMS.net. 5. If no new information is available, or no response at all is returned, pursue alternate contacts for information about these patients. These may be other phys icians, relatives or friends of the patients, or the patients themselves. 6. If there are any patients remaining on the control list for whom no current information has been located, you may be able to confirm the patient's vital status through various public agencies: The Department of Motor Vehicles, The Department of Vital Statistics, Voters' Registration, Social Security Administration, U.S. Office of Veterans Affairs, U.S. Postal Service, newspapers, etc. 7. If all leads fail to return any current informatio n, re-contact the patient's original or last known physician before you consider them \"lost\" to follow -up. 8. Record all follow -up efforts and the resulting information in the text of the patient's record. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 22 CHANGE S TO THE CPDMS.NET ABSTRACTOR'S MANUAL A. CHANGES RESULTING FROM IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COC's FORDS MANUAL IN 2003: Several data items previously required by CoC were deleted in their FORDS Manual, and many new data items were added. CPDMS.net has not deleted any data items with its 2003 release. However, the required new elements have been added. One of these is an ACoS approval flag, which a hospital user may set in order to invoke data entry processes that provide access to and edit checking on all C oC required fields. Otherwise, only KCR data collection requirements will be enforced by the software routines. The greatest impact of the FORDS Manual is in the collection of therapy information. The site specific surgery codes have been revised signifi cantly since the CoC's 1998 surgery code revisions. Due to ACoS and SEER reporting requirements, KCR will maintain the old data values in the ROADS surgery fields. These will be identified by the acronym 'ROADS' beside the field name and they must be coded for diagnoses prior to 1/1/2003. Three of the new CoC data items - Surgery at Primary Site, Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery, and Surgery at Distant Sites - will have the acronym 'FORDS' beside the new field name and they must be coded for diagnoses on or after 1/1/2003. The other ROADS surgery data items will either be discontinued (Surgical Approach, Number of Regional Lymph Nodes Removed, Reconstruction) or converted to generic codes in FORDS, applicable to all sites (Surgical Margins). There are eight new Radiation Therapy data items required in FORDS. These will be available only to hospitals that set their ACoS flag to 'approved.' These are NOT required by KCR. Finally, there will be new and separate therapy records specifically for non -definitive surgeries, Hormone Therapy, Immunotherapy, and Transplants/Endocrine procedures. The 'Other' therapy codes and definitions will be converted and revised accordingly. B. CHANGES FOR 2004: The two most significant changes for 2004 are the implementation of the collaborative staging system and the inclusion of benign and bordering intracranial and CNS tumors in the list of reportable conditions. C. CHANGES FOR 2005: The SEER Rx program is now used to categorize systemic treatments as ch emotherapy, hormone therapy or immunotherapy. The most significant change is the classification of drugs according to their mechanism of action. These drugs are now coded as chemotherapy: - cytostatic agents, including monoclonal antibodies (such as Rituxa n and Herceptin), growth factor inhibitors (such as Iressa), anti -angiogenesis agents (such as thalidomide, Avastin, and Neovastat) -anti-metabolites (such as Vidaza and Alimta) Introduction 23 The SEER Rx program used to classify drugs may be found at www.seer.cancer.gov/tools/seerrx . D. CHANGES FOR 2006 The CoC no longer requires class of case 0 cases to be followed by the registry or AJCC staged by the physician. However, KCR continues to require registries to follow these cases. Four additional comorbidity fields were added and the data item \"Systemic Therapy/Surgery Sequence\" was added. E. CHANGES FOR 2007 The SEER 2007 Multiple Primary and Histolog y Coding rules were implemented effective with cases diagnosed in 2007. These site- specific rules for determining the number of primary malignancies in solid tumors supersede all previous multiple primary rules. (Existing rules for determining the number of primary malignancies for lymphatic and hematopoietic diseases, and for benign and borderline intracranial and CNS tumors, remain in effect.) Along with the new Multiple Primary rules, six additional data items were introduced in 2007: Ambiguous Termin ology, Date of Conclusive Diagnosis, Multiplicity Counter, Date of Multiple Tumors, Type of Multiple Tumors, and Managing Physician. Per ACoS requirements, the National Provider Identification (NPI) numbers were initiated in 2007. These are unique 10 -digit identifiers for health care providers who bill Medicare (CMS) for services. The NPI data values are stored in the two support files: physician list and institution list. A lookup for NPI numbers is available at https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/NPPES/NPIRegistryHome.do . F. CHANGES FOR 2008 For cases diagnosed in 2008, the CoC considers pathologic staging information to be adequately collected by the CS items, and thus physician -assigned path ologic AJCC staging is no longer required to be collected. Clinical AJCC staging continues to be required for ACoS approved facilities. Collaborative Stage version 01.04.00 was released and is available at http://www.cancerstaging.org/cstage/manuals.html . Clarifications regarding the coding of embolization were issued by the CoC, NPCR, and SEER. Chemoembolization, in which tumor blood- flow is blocked by other means and a chemotherapy drug is injected into the tumor, is coded as chemotherapy. Radioembolization, in which tumor blood- flow is blocked and tiny radioactive beads or coils are injected into the tumor, is coded as radiation therapy. When blood flow to the tumor is blocked using othe r chemicals or materials (such as alcohol or acrylic), without the use of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, code this treatment in the 'Other' therapy field. Pre-surgical embolization of hypervascular tumors using particles, coils, or alcohol is NOT coded as therapy. This type of embolization is performed to make subsequent surgical resection easier, not as cancer -directed therapy. G. CHANGES FOR 2009 Beginning with 2009 diagnoses, maiden name should be collected, when known. HER2 test results will b e recorded for breast cases. Cases which are diagnosed in utero will use the actual date of diagnosis, rather than the date of birth (note: this situation requires an IF15 override). 2009 Abstractor's Manual 24 Two additional optional following physician fields were added. The cod es 209.0- 209.3 and 511.81 were added to the ICD -9-CM casefinding list, and a supplemental list of codes to aid in casefinding was made available as Appendix N. Introduction 25 Determining the Number of Primaries DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CASES TO ABSTRACTED Use the following references to determine the number of cases to be abstracted, based on the table below. I. Use the SEER 2007 Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules for solid tumors diagnosed on or after January 1, 2007. Use the SEER Multiple Primary rules in effect prior to 2007 for cases of in situ and malignant solid tumors diagnosed before 2007. II. Use Appendix A , 'Rules for Determining Multiple Primaries for Lymphatic and Hematopoietic Diseases,' for cases of this type. III. Use the ' Rules for determining multiple primaries for benign and borderline intracranial and CNS tumors' for cases of this type, which are reportable only if diagnosed on or after January 1, 2004. IV. Cases of Kaposi sarcoma (M9140) of any site are always a single primary. Code the site of origin if stated, or code to skin (C44.9) if Kaposi sarcoma arises simultaneously in skin and another site or if the site of origin is not identified. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 26 SEER Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules The SEER 2007 Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules are effective with cases diagnosed on or after January 1, 2007. They contain site -specific rules for lung, breast, colon, melanoma of the skin, head and neck, kidney, renal pelvis/ureter/bladder, a nd malignant brain tumors. An additional set of rules addresses the specific and general rules for all other sites. The multiple primary rules guide and standardize the process of determining the number of primaries to be abstracted. The histology rules contain detailed histology coding instruction. The complete Multiple Primary and Histology Coding rules may be downloaded from the SEER Web site at: http://seer.cancer.gov/t ools/mphrules/mphrules_manual_01012007.pdf . In November 2007, clarifications were issued which are available at http://seer.cancer.gov/tools/mphrules/replacement_pages_nov2007.pdf . The SEER 2007 Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules do not apply to hematopoietic primaries (lymphoma and leukemia M9590- 9989), Kaposi Sarcoma (M9140) of any site, or to the reportable benign or borderline intracranial or CNS tumors. Use the Site -specific rules for the following primary site groups, excluding leukemia and lymphoma (M9590- 9989) and Kaposi Sarcoma (M9140): Brain, malignant Breast Colon Head and Neck Kidney Lung Malignant Melanoma of the skin Renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, and other urinary Use the Other Sites Rules for solid malignant tumors that occur in primary sites not covered by site-specific rules. Introduction 27 Pre-2007 Multiple Primary Coding R ules For solid malignant tumors diagnosed before 2007, use the SEER Multiple Primary Rules below, which are based on the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD -O-3), to determine if a diagnosis is a single or multiple primary. 1. Use the definitions below under the heading \"Primary Site\" to decide whether the tumor(s) involve one site or multiple sites. 2. Follow the instructions under the heading \"Rules for Coding Histology of Solid Tumors Diagnosed Prior t o 2007\" in item #30090 ( Histology ) to decide tumor(s) single histology or mixed/multiple histologies. 3. Use the\"Rules for Determining Multiple Primary Cancers\" to decide whether the case should be abstracted as one primary or multiple primaries. 1. Definitions for determining a single site and a single histology. Primary Site A single site is defined as the same first three characters in the topography code for the sites listed below: C03 Gum C50 C48 peritoneum 28 EXAMPLE: The trigone of bladder (C67.0) and lateral wall of bladder (C67.2) are considered subsites of the bladder, and would be treated as one site. A tumor or lesion involving both subsites would be coded either to overlapping sites of bladder (C67.8), or bladder, NOS (C67.9). A single site is defined as the same fourth character in the topography code for the anatomic sites listed below: C18 Bones C49 Connective tissue EXAMPLE: The transverse colon (C18.4), and the descending colon (C18.6), are considered separate sites. The only EXCEPTION to this is familial polyposis or polyposis coli involving more than one segment of the colon. This is abstracted as only one primary, coded to colon, NOS (C18.9). If the familial polyposis involves both the colon and the rectum, abstract as one primary with site code C19.9. A single site involves more than one three character category in the topography coding scheme for the anatomic sites listed below: Sites Code To C01 and C02 Tongue C02.9 C05 and C06 Palate and unspecified parts of mouth C06.9 C07 and C08 Parotid and other C24.9 C30 Nasal -C57.9 Vulva, vagina, and organs C57.9 C56 and C57.0 -C57.4 Ovary, fallopian tube, parametrium, and uterine C56.9 if ovary; C57.9 if other Introduction 29 adnexa C60 and C63 Penis and other and unspecified male genital organs C63.9 C64, C65, C66, and C68 Kidney, urinary glands ed structures C75.9 EXAMPLE: Base of tongue (C01.9), and border of tongue (C02.1), are considered subsites of the tongue, and would be treated as one site - either overlapping lesion of tongue (C02.8) or tongue, NOS (C02.9). Each side of a paired organ is considered a separate site. Tumors arising on different sides of a paired organ are considered separate primaries, unless the tumor on one side is stated to be metastatic. Exceptions are bilateral involvement of the ovaries in which a single histology is reported, bilateral retinoblastomas, and bilateral Wilms' tumors, which are all considered single primaries. Histologic Type When the FIRST THREE DIGITS of the ICD -O-3 morphology codes are IDENTICAL , the lesions are the SAME HISTOLOGY, except for lymphatic and hematopoietic diseases and benign and borderline CNS tumors. Exception: Code the following as single primaries with a single histology, even though the first three digits of the ICD -O-3 morphology codes differ: Bladder lesions carcinoma - and - 8520/3) Code to 8522/3 Exception: Non -small cell carcinoma (8046/3) is not considered the same as 8041/3- 8045/3, even though the first three digits are the same. Exception: Lymphatic and hematopoietic disease (see \"Rules for Determining Multiple Primaries for Lymphatic and Hematopoietic Diseases\" and use Appendix A to determine multiple primaries). Exception: Benign and borderline CNS tumors (see \"Rules for Determining Multiple Primaries for Benign and Borderline Intracranial and CNS Tumors\" for multiple primary rules). 2009 Abstractor's Manual 30 Simultaneous/synchronous diagnosis Diagnoses that occur within two months of each other are considered simultaneous. 2. Rules for Determining Multiple Primary Cancers ( except for lymphatic and hematopoietic diseases and benign and borderline CNS tumors ). Single Primary 1. A single lesion of one histologic type is considered a single primary even if the lesion crosses site boundaries. 2. A single lesion with multiple histologic types is to be considered as a single primary. The most frequent combinations are listed in ICD -O-3. For example, combination terms such as \"adenosquamous carcinoma (8560/3)\" or \"combined small cell- large cell carcinoma (8045/3)\" are included. Any of these mixed histologies are to be considered one primary. 3. A single lesion with an in -situ component and an inva sive component is considered a single primary. 4. a) If a new cancer of the same histology as an earlier one is diagnosed in the same site within two months, consider this to be the same primary cancer. b) If a new cancer of the same histolo gy is diagnosed in the same site after two months, consider this new cancer a separate primary unless stated to be recurrent or metastatic. Exception to 4b: If there is an in- situ cancer followed by an invasive cancer in the same site with the same histology more than two months apart, report as two primaries even if stated to be a recurrence. NOTE: Bladder cancers, site codes C67.0 - C67.9, with histology codes 8120- 8130 may be abstracted at most twice; one abstract for the first in -situ lesion if it precedes the first invasive lesion, and one for the first invasive lesion (if diagnosed at least 2 months later than the in- situ lesion). This also applies to adenocarcinoma of the prostate. These are reported at most only twice; once for the firs t in-situ lesion if it precedes the first invasive lesion (these are very rare) and once for the first invasive lesion. NOTE: Kaposi's sarcoma (9140/3) is reported only once. Kaposi's sarcoma is coded to the site in which it arises. If Kaposi's sarcoma a rises in skin and another site simultaneously, code to skin (C44._). If no primary site is stated, code to skin (C44._). 5. Multiple lesions of the same histologic type: Introduction 31 a. Simultaneous multiple lesions of the sa me histologic type within the same site will be considered a single primary. Further, if one lesion has a behavior code of in- situ and another has a behavior code of malignant (invasive), still consider this to be a single primary whose behavior is maligna nt. b. Multiple lesions of the same histologic type occurring in different sites are considered to be separate primaries unless stated to be metastatic. Exception: Adenocarcinoma in multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon. NOTE: For paired organs, each side is considered a separate site. c. If only one histologic type is reported and if both sides of a paired site are involved within two months of diagnosis, a determination must be made as to whether the patient has one or two independent primaries. If it is determined that there are two independent primaries, two records are to be submitted, each with the appr opriate laterality and extent of disease information. There are THREE EXCEPTIONS to this rule. Simultaneous bilateral involvement of the ovaries in which there is only a single histology is to be considered one primary and laterality is to be coded '4'. Bi lateral retinoblastomas and bilateral Wilms' tumor are always considered single primaries (whether simultaneous or not), and laterality is coded as '4'. d. If one histologic type is reported in one side of a paired organ and a differe nt histologic type is reported in the other paired organ, consider these two primaries unless there is a statement to the contrary. EXAMPLE: If a ductal lesion occurs in one breast and a lobular lesion occurs in the opposite breast, these are considered to be two primaries. 6. Multiple lesions of different histologic types: a. Multiple lesions of mixed histologies in the same site are a single primary. EXAMPLE: Tumors with predominant features or combination codes such as combined small cell -large cell carcinoma 8045/3. b. Multiple lesions of different histologic types within a single site are to be considered separate primaries whether occurring simultaneously or at different times. Exception: For multiple lesions within a single site occurring within two months, if one lesion is stated to be carcinoma, NOS, adenocarcinoma, NOS, Melanoma, NOS, or sarcom a, NOS and the 2009 Abstractor's Manual 32 second lesion is a more specific term, such as large cell carcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, or spindle cell sarcoma, consider this to be a single primary and code to the more specific term. Exception: Within each breast, combinations of ductal and lobular carcinoma occurring within two months of each other are to be considered a single primary and the histology coded according to ICD -O-3. (8522/3) Exception: Thyroid with two - one papil lary and the other follicular - should be reported as one primary with the mixed histology code 8340/3. c. Multiple lesions of different histologic types occurring in different sites are considered separate pri maries whether occurring simultaneously or at different times.

Simultaneous or different Multiple Exceptions: Breast (lobular and ductal); bladder (transitional and papillary,) and thyroid (papillary and follicular). Multiple Multiple Simultaneous or different Multiple *See the preceding site and histology rules for definition of \"multiple\". 2009 Abstractor's Manual 34 Rules for Determining Multiple Primaries for Lymphatic and Hematopoietic Diseases (9590- 9989): If the physician clearly states that a hematopoietic diagnosis is a new primary, use that information. Otherwise, the determination of multiple primaries should be done using the guidelines in Appendix A . Rules: 1. Topography is NOT considered in determining multiple primaries of lymphatic and hematopoietic diseases. 2. The time interval between diagnoses does NOT enter into the decision. Appendix A was completely revised with the implementation of ICD -O-3 and the new table for determining multiple hematopoietic malignancies is effective with cancers diagnosed on or after January 1, 2001. Appendix A contains links to both the revised table and the previous table, which is to be used for pre -2001 diagnoses. One of the major changes that took place with the implementation of ICD -O-3 was the inclusion of newly reportable hematopoietic diseases (myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic syndromes). These cases are not accessioned or sequenced unless they were diagnosed on or after January 1, 2001 , even if the patient received treatment for this disease after that date. NOTE: If a reportable hematopoietic malignancy is diagnosed after January 1, 2001 in the same person who has another hematopoietic disease diagnosed pr ior to 2001, use Appendix A to determine if the second condition must be abstracted. If the cross check is D, it should be abstracted. If the cross check is S, it should not be abstracted if the first condition was abstracted; it should be abstracted if the first condition was not. Introduction 35 Rules for determining multiple primaries for benign and borderline intracranial and CNS tumors (C70.0 - subsite, histology, and laterality must be considered. A.. Primary Site - A single site is defined as the same fourth character (subsite) in the topography code for the anatomic sites listed C70 arise dif ferent subsites, then they are separate primaries. Example: A benign tumor in the parietal lobe (C71.3) and a separate benign tumor in the frontal lobe (C71.1). Count and abstract as separate primaries. Example: Meningioma lobe and separate primaries. Exception: If one subsite is non- specific (such as brain, NOS C71.9), and other is specific in same 3 character category (such as C71.__), count as one primary only. For example, biopsy of temporal lobe (C71.2) shows benign tumor and diagnosis from CT scan states \"neoplasm of brain\" (C71.9). Report one primary only (C71.2). B. Histology - If separate tumors have different histologies, then they are separate primaries. To determine whether tumors have different histologies, code the histology of each tumor and look them up in the table below. Histologic Groupings To Determine Same Histology for neither histology code is in the table above and codes are the same at the three- digit level , abstract as one primary. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 36 Example: Patient has clear cell meningioma (9538/1) of the cerebral meninges and a separate transitional cell meningioma (9537/0) in another part of the same hemisphere. Count and abstract as one primary. 2. If the two histology codes are in the same category of the table, count as one primary. Example: Patient has a ganglioglioma (9505/1) of the cerebellum a neurocytoma (9506/1) of the cerebellopontine angle (C71.6). Count and abstract as one primary. 3. If the histology codes are in different categories of the table, count and abstract as separate primaries. Example: Patient has a choroid plexus papilloma (9444/1) of the third ventricle (C71.5). Count and abstract as separate primaries. 4. If one histology is in the benig n brain histology table and the other is not, compare codes at the three- digit level. If they are the same, count as one primary. If they are different, count as two primaries. Example: Patient has a subependymal glioma (9383/1) diagnosed on needle biops y in August, and at resection in September the diagnosis is subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (9384/1). Count and abstract as one primary. Example: Patient has a Pacinian tumor (9507/0) diagnosed in March and a dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (9 413/1) of the occipital lobe diagnosed in July. Count and abstract as separate primaries. C. Laterality - For each non- malignant (and malignant) primary brain and CNS tumor for the sites shown below and with a diagnostic date on or after January 1, 2004, code laterality using codes 1-4 or 9. Midline tumors are coded 9. Prior to 1 -1-04 diagnoses, primary brain and CNS tumors were coded '0' for laterality. CNS Sites for Acoustic nerve C72.5 Cranial nerve, NOS 1. If laterality is same side, one side unknown or not applicable, and same subsite and same histology, then abstract as on e primary. 2. If laterality is both sides, abstract separate primaries. Example: Benign tumors (same histology) in left and right temporal lobes. Count and abstract as separate primaries. D. Timing - If a new non- malignant tumor i s diagnosed in the same subsite with the same histology as a previous one, then one primary is abstracted, regardless of time elapsed. (For tumors with an initial diagnosis prior to 1- 1-04, do not abstract recurrent non- malignant CNS tumors.) E. Mu ltiple lesions with different behavior codes - 1. Non -malignant tumor followed by malignant tumor: abstract separate primaries regardless of timing. 2. Malignant tumor followed by non- malignant tumor: abstract separate primaries regardless of timing. 3 . Benign tumor transforms to malignancy (rare occurrence): create second abstract for malignancy. Example: Patient is diagnosed and treated for choroid plexus papilloma (9390/0) of right lateral ventricle in June 2 004. Eighteen months later, patient is symptomatic again and re -biopsy of same area is reported as choroid plexus carcinoma (9390/3). Count and abstract as two primaries. 39 Patient Data 10020 - SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER Field Length: 9 Enter the patient's social security number in the field provided. If the patient does not have a social security number, use the formula below to assign a unique temporary number. NOTE: The social security number is the main element used in identifying patients, matching information, etc., and must be recorded accurately for every patient entered in the system. FORMULA: Temporary \"social security\" numbers are assigned only to patients not possessing a verifiable social security number. Use the initials of the patient's first, middle and last names, followed by digits represe nting the birth date. (Use zero when the patient's middle initial is unknown.) Thus, John Brown, born January 21, 1946, would be issued the following number: J0B - 01 - 2146 Where month, day or year of birth is not known, enter \"99\". Temporary numbers should be checked for duplication within your hospital's cancer registry before the patient is accessioned. If the temporary number works out to be exactly the same as that of a different patient, the registrar should change the middle initial to the number \"1\". If there are more than two patients with the same temporary number, continue to substitute numbers in the middle initial in sequential order. [FYI: If the Medicare billing number is a Social Security Number f ollowed by a B or D, this indicates that the SSN belongs to the spouse of the patient.] 2009 Abstractor's Manual 40 10030 - LAST NAME Field Length: 20 Enter the patient's last name in the spaces provided. If the name exceeds the number of spaces provided, enter as much as possible. If during the course of follow -up, the patient's name changes, update the record with the current name. Use the following rules when recording patient last names: 1. Name fields should contain alpha characters and blanks only -- no special characters such as apostrophes, commas, hyphens, etc. 2. Any name titles or suffixes, such as DR., M.D., MR., MS., JR., SR., III, IV, and so on, should be recorded in the middle name field a fter, or instead of, the middle name. These data are optional , and need not be recorded at all. 3. Blanks are allowed in the last name field, but they must be used consistently in order to match patients at the central data base. Therefore, the following rules are established: a. When a patient has two last names, or a hyphenated last name, you may type both in the last name field separated by a blank space. b. Patients with two -part last names, such as VAN HORN or ST JOHN, may have a space between the two parts, but no special punctuation marks. c. Names like 'MCCOY' or 'O'BRYAN' should be typed 'MCCOY' or 'OBRYAN' with no spaces and no punctuation. Patient Data 41 10040 - FIRST NAME Field Length: 15 Enter the patient's first name in the spaces provided. If the name exceeds the number of spaces provided, enter as much as possible. Use the following rules when recording the patient's first name: 1. Name fields should contain alpha characters and blanks only -- no special characters such as apostrophes, commas, hyphens, etc. 2. Any name titles or suffixes, such as DR., M.D., MR., MS., JR., SR., III, IV, and so on, should be recorded in the middle name field after, or instead of, the middle name. These data are optional , and need not be recorded at all. 3. Blanks are allowed in the first name field, but t hey must be used consistently in order to match patients at the central data base. Therefore, the following rules are established: a. Patients with two -part first names, or two first names, may have them both recorded in the first name field, separated by a blank space. For example: MARY JO MARY ANN JOHN ED etc. b. Patients who go by their initials should have their first initial recorded in the first name field, and the second in the middle name fie ld. For example: J.B. JONES would have 'J' in first name and 'B' in middle name. c. Patients with a name and an initial should have them recorded in separate fields. For example: H. EDWARD SMITH should have 'H' in first name and 'E DWARD' in middle name. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 42 10050 - MIDDLE NAME Field Length: 10 Enter the patient's middle name in the spaces provided. If the name exceeds the number of spaces, enter as much as possible. If only an initial is given, ente r the initial. You may also record the patient's title or name suffix in this field -- such as: DR, JR, SR, III, M.D., etc. Patient Data 43 10055 - MAIDEN NAME Field Length: 15 This is a required field if the patient's maiden name is available. Leave blank for males or if it is unknown. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 44 10060 - CURRENT STREET ADDRESS - LINE 1 Field Length: 40 Record the currently known number and str eet address of the patient's usual residence. Leave a blank between numbers and words if space permits. Do not use periods after abbreviations. Use the U.S. Postal Service Guidelines below when entering addresses. This item is different from patient address at diagnosis in that it provides a current address for follow -up purposes. Address -Line 1 will be used for mailing labels, so it should contain the patient's mailing address. This item should be updated as newer information becomes available. Normally a residence is the home named by the patient. Do not use a temporary address. Legal status and citizenship are not factors in residency decisions. Rules of residency are identical to or comparabl e with rules used by the Census Bureau whenever possible. Rules for persons without apparent residences: Persons with More than One Residence (summer and winter homes): Use the address the patient specifies if a usual residence is not apparent. Perso ns with No Usual Residence (transients, homeless, migrant workers): Use the address of the place they were staying when the cancer was diagnosed. This could be a shelter or the diagnosing institution. Persons Away at School: College students are resident s of the school area. Boarding school children below college level are residents of their parents' home. Persons in Institutions: The Census Bureau states \"Persons under formally authorized, supervised care or custody\" are residents of the institution. This includes: -Incarcerated persons -Persons in homes, schools, hospitals, or wards for the physically disabled, mentally retarded, or mentally ill -Long -term residents of other hospitals, such as Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals Persons in the Armed Forces and on Maritime Ships: Members of the armed forces are residents of the installation area. Use the stated address for mil itary personnel and their family. Military personnel may use the installation address or the surrounding community's address. Guidelines for Entering Postal Addresses Street Name Patient Data 45 Spell out street names completely. Remove apartment numbers and letters from street numbers; apartment numbers, floors, suites, etc. should be placed AFTER the street name, separated by a comma. Eg. 143 LAKE ST, APT D 2365 HARRODSBURG RD, SUITE A230 Directionals This is a term the Postal Service us es to refer to the part of the address that gives directional information for delivery (i.e., N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW). If a directional word is the first word in the street name and there is no other directional to the left of it, abbreviate it. Eg. NORTH BAY ST SOUTHEAST END AVE Acceptable N BAY ST SE END AVE Preferred If a directional word is located to the right of the street name and suffix, abbreviate it. Eg. BAY DRIVE SOUTHWEST Acceptable BAY DR SW Preferred When two directional words appear consecutively as one or two words, before the street name or following the street name or suffix, then the two words be come either the pre- or the post - directionals. Exceptions are any combinations of NORTH- SOUTH or EAST -WEST as consecutive words. In these cases the second directional becomes part of the primary name and is spelled out completely in the primary name field. NORTH SOUTH OAK ST MAPLE CT EAST WEST NORTH EAST MAIN ST BAY AVE SOUTHWEST Acceptable N SOUTH OAK ST 2009 Abstractor's Manual 46 MAPLE COURT EAST W NE MAIN ST BAY AVE SW Preferred If the two -word directional is part of the street name do not abbreviate it. Eg. SOUTHEAST FREEWAY NORTH Acceptable SOUTHEAST FWY N Preferred Suffixes Abbreviations The suffix of the address should conform with the standard suffix abbreviations used by the USPS (see Appendix D ). Two Suffixes If an address has two consecutive suffixes, abbreviate the second of the two words and place it in the suffix field. The first of the two words is part of the primary name. Spell it out on the mailpiece in its entirety after the street name. Eg. 789 MAIN AVENUE DRIVE 4513 3 RD STREET CIRCLE WEST 1000 AVE E Acceptable 789 MAIN AVENUE DR 4513 3RD STREET CIR W 1000 AVENUE E Preferred Rural Route Addresses Format Print rural route addresses on mailpieces as: RR N BOX NN. Do not use the words RURAL, NUMBER, NO., or the pound sign (#) . RR 2 BOX 152 Patient Data 47 RR 9 BOX 23A Leading Zero A leading zero before the rural route number is not necessary. RR 3 BOX 98D Post Office Box Addresses Format Avoid using PO Box or RR addresses if you have a street addres s. Post Office Box addresses are output as PO BOX NN on the mailpiece. Eg. PO BOX 11890 PO BOX G 2009 Abstractor's Manual 48 10070 - CURRENT STREET ADDRESS - LINE 2 Field Length: 40 This field provides space to record additional address information, such as the name of a nursing home, apartment complex, etc. This line will not be displayed on mailing labels. If the patient has both a PO Box (for a mailing address), and a street name a nd number (for a living address), put the street name and number on address -line 2. Update this item if the patient's address changes. Leave this field blank if the additional address space is not needed. Patient Data 49 10080 - CURRENT CITY Field Length: 20 Enter the city of current residence in the spaces provided. Abbreviate only if necessary. A list of Kentucky cities and towns is located in Appendix D . This item is different from city at diagnosis in that it provides the current city or town for follow up purposes.

Additional rules for determining residency may be found under the data item \"CURRENT STREET ADDRESS.\" 2009 Abstractor's Manual 50 10090 - CURRENT STATE Field Length: 2 Record the two letter abbreviation for the state in which the patient currently resides. Refer to Appendix B also for a list of the state abbreviations. Appendix B contains abbreviations for U.S. territories and Canadian provinces, as well. Residents of countries outside the United States, its territories, or Canada, should be coded with the two- character code 'XX' or 'YY' if th e state or country or current residence is unknown. This item is different from state at diagnosis in that it provides the current state or country for follow up purposes. This item should be updated as newer information becomes available. Additional r ules for determining residency may be found under the data item \"CURRENT STREET ADDRESS.\" Patient Data 51 10100- 10110 - CURRENT ZIP CODE Field Length: 9 Enter the nine digit zip code for the patient's current address. If only five digits are given, record those and leave the rest of the field blank. Refer to the U.S. Postal Service web site (see Appendix D ) for the appropriate code if none is recorded in patient's record. Code 888888888 if the patient's address is in a county other than Canada, the United States, or U.S. possessions. Code 999999999 if the patient's address is in Canada, the United States, or a U.S. possession, but the zip code is unknown. This item is diff erent from zip code at diagnosis in that it provides the current zip code for follow up purposes. This item should be updated as newer information becomes available. Additional rules for determining residency may be found under the data item \"CURRENT STREET ADDRESS.\" 2009 Abstractor's Manual 52 10120 - HOME TELEPHONE NUMBER Field Length: 10 Enter the patient's area code in the first three spaces followed by the seven digit number.

Pack years equal the average number of packs smoked per day multiplied by the number of years of cigarette use. For example, if a person smokes two packs a day for 30 years, then the cigarette pack years equals 60. - Enter \"0\" if patient never smoked cigarettes. - Enter \"999\" if the pack years of cigarette use is unknown. The computer will automatically right justify digits at data entry. Patient Data 65 10260 - Number of Live Births Field Length: 2 For female patients, record the number of live births the patient has delivered. If male, enter \"99\". The computer will automatically right justify single digit entries. This is not the same as gravidity or parity. Gravidi ty refers to the number of pregnancies. Parity refers to the number deliveries of viable offspring (even if stillborn). Number of live births refers to the actual number of offspring born alive. If unknown, enter \"99\". 2009 Abstractor's Manual 66 10270 - OCCUPATION Field Length: 20 Enter the patient's primary occupation throughout his/her lifetime.

Even when the code is believed to be in error, the entry as coded on the Deat h Certificate is to be used. Code: Underlying Cause of Death 0000 Patient alive at last contact 7777 State death certificate or listing not available 7797 State death certificate or listing available, but underlying death not coded. All othe r cases: ICD -9 Underlying Cause of Death Code if date of death prior to January 1, 1999 or ICD -10 Underlying Cause of Death Code if date of death on or after January 1, 1999. Do not code this field from the medical record. A list of all ICD -10 codes is av ailable online at http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/ . Underlying cause of death codes usually have four digits. Some codes may have an optional fifth digit. The decimal point will already appear on the form and on the data entry screen. If a fourth digit for the underlying cause of death is \"X\", \"blank\", or \" -\" use '9' for the fourth digit. In Kentucky, the state central registry will match all death certifica tes with the central database. A file of matched patient records will be generated for each Kentucky hospital. This file will automatically be loaded into CPDMS.net and will be used by each hospital to update that hospital's patients with date of death and cause of death from the death certificate. It is not necessary to have a copy of the death certificate as long as the official code for the underlying cause of death is available. You may use the Cause of Death code obtained from a linkage with the National Death Index, or from an out -of-state data exchange cancer report. If the death certificate is not available, do not attempt to code it; use code '777.7'. For example: Underlying Cause of Death ICD-10 Code Enter: Cancer of C169 Data 69 10300 - Place of Death Field Length: 1 Use the one digit code to describe the patient's place of death. 1 - Home 2 - Hospital 3 - Nursing Home 4 - Hospice 5 - Other 9 - Unknown 2009 Abstractor's Manual 70 10310 - Number of Primaries Field Length: 2 This is a field calculated by the computer.

Patient Data 75 10360 - ACoS Patient Accession Number Field Length: 10 A unique accession number is assigned to each patient. The accession number identifies the patient even if multiple primaries exist. The first fou r digits of the accession number specify the year in which the patient was first seen at the reporting institution for the diagnosis and/or treatment of cancer. The last six numbers are the numerical order in which the first reportable case of this patient was entered into the registry's data base. The computer calculates this field by copying in the accession number of the first abstracted case entered for this patient. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 76 10390 - SEER Pati ent ID Field Length: 8 This is a unique number assigned to an individual patient by the central registry. KCR will assign the same number to all the patient's subsequent tumor (records). The SEER Patient ID does not appear on the patient abstract and is not available for analysis. Patient Data 77 10410 - IHS Link Status Field Length: 1 The Indian Health Service (IHS) linkage reports the results of linking the central reg istry database with the Indian Health Service patient registration database. The IHS linkage idenitifies American Indians who were misclassified as non -Indian in the registry. The computer linkage program will automatically assign the code for this da ta item. Codes 0 Record sent for linkage, no IHS match 1 Record sent for linkage, IHS match blank Record not sent for linkage or linkage results pending 2009 Abstractor's Manual 78 10420 - LAST MODIFICATION BY Field Length: 8 This field is calculated by the computer. The user name of the last person to modify patient data is recorded and is updated each time the record is edited. Patient Data 79 10430 - LAST MODIFICATION TIME Field Length: 19 The date and time that patient data was last edited is automatically recorded by the computer. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 80 10440- 10530 - Patient User Defined Fields Field Length: 15 (x 10) This element provides up to ten fields for coding additional information for each patient. These will be user defined fields based on the individual institution's need or desire to track patterns of diagnostic and treatment procedures, as well as survival, with particular types of cancer patients. For example: \"a\" could be used to code alcohol use. \"b\" could be used to code religion \"c\" could be used to code exposure to hazardous substances, etc. 81 Case and FU Data 20030 - SEQUENCE NUMBER (Other Primary) Field Length: 2 This field is for recording a history of cancer that was not diagnosed or treated at your hospital. It may also be used to record a subsequent primary which occurs in one of your cancer patients but is not diagnosed or treated by your hospital. The sequence number represents the order of all reportable primary tumors diagnosed during a patient's lifetime. It counts the occurrence of independent, primary diagnoses, regardless of who must report them, but only if diagnosed in years for which that condition was considered reportable. Thus, it does not include skin malignancies and carcinoma in- situ of the cervix, diagnosed in years when they were not reportable, BUT it does include benign and borderline intracranial tumors diagnosed before 2004. Enter the number which designates the chronological order of this primary tumor which is not reportable by your hospital. 1 - 1st primary 2 - 2nd primary 3 - 3rd primary ... etc. Single digits will automatically be right justified in the computer. This field may be repeated as often as necessary for any given patient. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 82 20040 - SITE GROUP (Other Primary) Field Length: 2 Record the two digit code for the site group into which this primary malignancy is categorized. Use Appendix C to determine the appropriate site group, based on the anatomic site and histology mentioned. Site group code \"55\" is available only for 'Other Primaries ' if you cannot determine to which site group the malignancy is coded. If 'lung cancer' is all that is known, code \"23\" for non -small cell lung. Starting in 2004, site group 60 is assigned for all benign and borderline intracranial tumors. Case and FU Data 83 20050 - YEAR OF DIAGNOSIS (Other Primary) Field Length: 4 Record the year of diagnosis for the other primary. If the year of diagnosis is unknown, use 9999. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 84 20060 - COMMENT (Other Primary) Field Length: 30 Enter a brief description of the primary which is not reportable by your institution. You may wish to include information regarding topography, histology, date of diagnosis, the location where this primary was diagnosed or treated, or the reason the case is not reportable by your registry. Case and FU Data 85 20070 - LAST MODIFICATION BY (Other Primary) Field Length: 8 The user name of the person who last edited the case type \"O\" is recorded by the computer in this field. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 86 20080 - LAST MODIFICATION TIME (Other Primary) Field Length: 19 The computer automatically records the date and time the case type \"O\" record was edited. Case and FU Data 87 30030 - SEQUENCE NUMBER Field Length: 2 The sequence number represents the order of all primary reportable tumors diagnosed during a patient's lifetime. It counts the occurrence of independent, primary diagnoses, regardless of who must report them, but only if diagnosed in years in which they were considered reportable. Thus, it does not include skin malignancies and carcinoma in -situ of the cervix diagnosed in years when they were not considered reportable. Exception: Benign and borderline CNS tumors are sequenced to include historical tumors, including those diagnosed prior to 2004. Enter the number which designa tes the chronological order of this primary tumor in relation to all primary tumors (including in -situ) that the patient has had. (Single digits will be right justified by the computer.) 1 - 1st primary 2 - 2nd primary 3 - 3rd primary 4 - 4th primary 5 - 5th primary 6 - 6th primary 7 - 7th primary 8 - 8th primary 9 - 9th primary ... (and so on) For patients having more than one independent, reportable primary diagnosed at the same time, the selection of the first is assigned to the primary with the worst prognosis. If no difference in prognosis is evident, the selection of the sequence number may be arbitrary. Only include reportable conditions, as outlined earlier. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 88 30040 - SITE GROUP Field Length: 2 A two digit code for the site group into which this primary malignancy is categorized will be calculated by the computer. Appendix C shows the appropriate site groups, based on the anatomic site and histology mentioned for this case. Starting in 2004, site group 60 is assigned for all benign and borderline intracranial tumors. Case and FU Data 89 30050 - CASE TYPE Field Length: 1 This field indicates whether a case will be entered into the database as a full abstract (case type A) or as an \"other\" primary (case type O). Use case type O only for primaries that are collected by KCR but which are not reportable by your r egistry. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 90 30060 - ICD- O VERSION Field Length: 1 Enter the appropriate code for the version of ICD -O which was used to determine the topography and morphology codes entered in items 32 and 33. 1 = ICD -O, 1st edition (1976) F = ICD -O, Field Trial edition (1988) 2 = ICD -O, 2nd Edition (1990) 3 = ICD -O, 3rd Edition (2001) All cases diagnosed before January 1, 2001 should be coded with the ICD -O, 2nd edition used to determine th e topography and morphology codes. All cases diagnosed on or after January 1, 2001 should be coded 3, with the 3rd edition used to determine the topography and morphology codes. In the computerized record, all cases will have the ICD -O-3 topography, hi stology and behavior codes stored. Cases diagnosed prior to 2001 will have the ICD -O-2 histology and behavior codes stored as well. See \"ICD -O-3 Errata and Clarifications\" in Appendix K , to be used when abs tracting cases diagnosed after January 1, 2001. Case and FU Data 91 30070 - ICD- O-3 CONVERSION FLAG Field Length: 1 Record the one digit code specifying how the conversion of site and morphology codes from ICD-O-2 to ICD-O-3 was accomplished. Codes 0 - Primary site and morphology originally coded in ICD -O-3 1 - Primary site and morphology converted without review 3 - Primary site computer -converted without review; morphology converted with review If the diagnosis date is prior to January 1, 2001, the case record must have: * an ICD -O-2 histology and behavior codes * a conversion flag value of 1 or 3 The computer will automatically convert the ICD -O-2 codes to the ICD -O-3 codes if the conve rsion flag is 1. If the diagnosis date is on or after January 1, 2001, the case record must have: * ICD -O-3 histology and behavior codes * a conversion flag of 0 * blanks in the ICD -O-2 field ICD-O-3 Conversion Flag Controls Field Editing 0 Originally coded in ICD -O-3 (cursor goes only to ICD -O-3 histology) 1 without only to ICD -O-2 histology) 3 ICD-O-2 -O-3 histology) 2009 Abstractor's Manual 92 30080 - TOPOGRAPHY CODE Field Length: 5 Enter the ICD -O 3rd edition Topography code which describes the anatomical site of the patient's primary tumor. This is a five character field. After the \"C\", enter the three d igit code; the decimal point is already in the correct position. The International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD -O) 3rd edition , represents an extension of Chapter II of the ICD -10 coding reference. ICD -O permits the coding of all neoplasm s by topography, morphology, and cell behavior -- providing greater detail than that permitted with ICD -9 or ICD -10 coding schemes. The structure of the ICD -O reference book contains three major sections: Topography - A numerical list of anatomic sites adapted from the malignant neoplasms section of Chapter II of ICD -10. The topographic terms have 3-digit code numbers preceded by a \"C\" which run from C00.0 to C80.9. Morphology - A numerical list of histologic terms that is a revised and expanded version of the morphology section of The Manual of Tumor Nomenclature and Coding. The ICD -O, 3rd edition includes new histologic types that have come into the literature since 1990. It has revised the Leukemia and Lymphoma se ctions and now includes several hematopoietic diseases that were previously considered borderline. Alphabetic Index - A list of anatomic sites, histologic terms and selected tumor -like lesions and conditions. Refer to the introductory pages of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition , for a more detailed discussion of the differences between ICD -O and ICD -10, as well as for rules governing the appropriate assignment of ICD -O codes. See also Appendix K for errata and clarifications to ICD -O-3rd edition. Case and FU Data 93 30090 - HISTOLOGY Field Length: 4 Instructions for Coding Record histology using the ICD -O-3 codes in the Numeric Lists/Morphology (ICD ICD-O-3 identifies codes with an \"M\" preceding the code number. Do not record the \"M.\" Follow the coding rules outlined on pages 20 through 40 of ICD -O-3. Use the SEER 2007 Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules when coding the histology for reportable solid malignant tumors. These rules are effective for cases diagnosed January 1, 2007, or later. Do not use these rules to abstract cases diagnosed prior to this date; for these cases, see the section below entitled \"Rules for Coding Histology Prior to 2007.\" Review all pathology reports. Code the final pathologic diagnosis. EXCEPTION : If the final diagnosis is tumor, NOS), then code the histology from the microscopic description or comment i f it identifies a more specific histologic type (higher ICD -O-3 code) such as adenocarcinoma, amelanotic melanoma, or spindle cell sarcoma. The codes for cancer, NOS (8000) and carcinoma, NOS (8010) are not interchangeable. If the physician says that th e patient has carcinoma, then code carcinoma, NOS (8010). Lymphomas may be classified by the Rappaport classification or the Working Formulation. If both systems are used to classify the disease, then the term used to describe the lymphoma may differ. The Working Formulation term should take precedence (ICD -O-3, pp. 13- 18). Note that the determination of multiple primaries for benign and borderline intracranial and CNS tumors is based on histologic groupings. See the table and rules below for histologic groupings for non- malignant brain and CNS tumors. See Table of Specific Histologies that should not be coded to ill -defined sites (C76._). Rules for Coding the Histology of Solid Tumors Diagnosed Prior to 2007 Coding Instructions Use all o f the information for a single primary to code the histology. 1. If there is no tumor specimen, code the histology described by the medical practitioner. 2. Use the histology stated in the final diagnosis from the pathology report. Use the pathology from t he procedure that resected the majority of the primary tumor. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 94 If a more specific histologic type is definitively described in the microscopic portion of the pathology report or the comment, code the more specific diagnosis. 3. Lymphomas may be classified b y the WHO Classification, REAL system, Rappaport , or Working Formulation . The WHO Classification is preferred. See page 13 in the ICD -O-3 for a discussion of hematologic malignancies. 4. Cases reported to KCR cannot have a metastatic (/6) behavior code. If the only pathology specimen is from a metastatic site, code the appropriate histology code and the malignant behavior code /3. The primary site and its metastatic site(s) have the same basic histology. Histology Coding Rules for Single Tumor \u00b7 The rules are in hierarchical order. Rule 1 has the highest priority. \u00b7 Use the rules in priority order. \u00b7 Use the first rule that applies to the case. (Do not apply any additional rules.) 1. Code the histology if only one type is mentioned in the pathology report. 2. Code the invasive histology when both invasive and in situ tumor are present. Example: Pathology report reads infiltrating ductal carcinoma and cribriform ductal carcinoma insitu. Code the invasive histology 8500/3. Exception: If the histology of the invasive component is an 'NOS' term (e.g., carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, melanoma, sarcoma), then code the histology of the specific term associated with the insitu component and an invasive behavior code. 3. Use a mixed histology cod e if one exists Examples of mixed codes: (This is not a complete list, these are examples only) 8490 Mixed tumor, NOS 9085 Mixed germ cell tumor Teratocarcinoma, embryonal carcinoma and teratoma 4. Use a combination histology code if one exists Examples of combination codes: (This is not a complete list; these are examples only) 8255 Renal cell carcinoma, mixed clear cell and chromophobe types 8523 Infiltrating duct carcinoma mixed with other types of carcinoma 8524 Infiltrating lobular carcinoma mixed with other types of carcinoma 8560 Adenosquamous carcinoma 8045 Combined small cell carcinoma, combined small cell -large cell 5. Code the more specific term when one of the terms is 'NOS' and the other is a more specific description of the same histology. Example 1: Pathology report reads poorly differentiated carcinoma, probably squamous in origin. Code the histology as squamous cell carcinoma rather than the non -specific term \"carcinoma.\" Example 2: The pathology report from a nephrectomy reads renal cell carcinoma (8312) (renal cell identifies the affected organ system rather th an the histologic cell type) in one portion of the report and Case and FU Data 95 clear cell carcinoma (8310) (a histologic cell type) in another section of the report. Code clear cell carcinoma (8310); renal cell carcinoma (8312) refers to the renal system rather than the cell type, so renal cell is the less specific code. 6. Code the majority of tumor. a. Based on the pathology report description of the tumor. b. Based on the use of majority terms. See definition for majority terms. Terms that mean the majority of tumor Terms that DO NOT mean the majority of tumor Predominantly With foci of With features of Focus of/focal Major Areas of Type1 Elements of With.....Differentiation1 Component1 Pattern (Only if written in College of American Pathologists [CAP] Protocol)2 Architecture (Only if written in College of American Pathologists [CAP] Protocol)2 Note: Examples of CAP protocols for specific primary sites may be found on the website: http://www.cap.org/apps/docs/cancer_protocols/protocols_index.html 7. Code the numerically higher ICD-O-3 code. This is the rule with the lowest priority and should be used infrequently. Histology Coding Rules for Multiple Tumors with Different Behaviors in Same Organ Reported as a Single Primary 1. Code the histology of the invasive tumor when one lesion is in situ (/2) and the other is invasive (/3). Example: At mastectomy for removal of a 2 cm invasive ductal carcinoma, an additional 5 cm area of intraductal carcinoma was noted. Code histology and behavior as invasive ductal carcinoma (8500/3). Histology Coding Rules for Multiple Tumors in Same Organ Reported as a Single Primary 1. Code the histology when multiple tumors have the same histology. 2. Code the histology to adenocarcinoma (8140/_; in situ or invasive) when there is an adenocarcinoma and an adenocarcinoma in a polyp (8210/_, 8261/_, 8263/) in the same segment of the colon or rectum. 3. Code the histology to carcinoma (8010/_; in situ or invasive) when there is a carcinoma and a carcinoma in a polyp (8210/_) in the same segment of the colon or rectum. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 96 4. Use a combination code for the following: a. Bladder: Papi llary and urothelial Follicular and papillary carcinoma (8340) 5. Code the more specific term when on e of the terms is 'NOS' and the other is a more specific description of the same histology. 6. Code all other multiple tumors with different histologies as multiple primaries. Histologic groupings to determine same histology for non -malignant brain tumor s When there are multiple tumors , use the following table to determine if the tumors are the same histology or different Histologic Group Table for Non -Malignant Brain Tumors 1. If both histologies are listed in the table, then a. Histologies that are in the same grouping or row in the table are the same histology. Note: Histologies that are in the same grouping are a progression, differentiation or subtype of a single histologic category. b. Histologies listed in different groupings (or rows) in the table are different histologies 2. If one or both of the histologies is not listed in the table , then a. If the ICD -O-3 codes for both histologies have the identical first three digits, the histologies are the same . b. If the first three digits of the ICD -O-3 histology code are different , the histology types are different. Case and FU Data 97 Specific Histologies with Ill- Defined Sites If any of the following histologies appears only with an ill -defined site description (e.g., \"abdominal\" or \"arm\"), code it to the tissue in which such tumors arise rather than the ill- defined region (C76._) of the body, which contains multiple tissues. Histology Description Code to this tumors, lymphatic vessel tumors C49._, Connective, Subcutaneous and Other Soft Tissues 9580- 9582 and alveolar soft part and giant cell Bone and Cartilage C49._, Connective, Subcutaneous Tissues type C07._ C08._ for Other and Unspecified Major Salivary Glands Refer to the introductory pages of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition , for a more detailed discussion of the rules governing the appropriate assignment of ICD -O codes.

The fifth digit of the ICD-O-2 morphology code is the behavior code. Record the behavior of the tumor being reported 2009 Abstractor's Manual 102 30130 - TUMOR GRADE Field Length: 1 Grade, Differentiation (Codes 1, 2, 3, 4, 9) Pathologic testing determines the grade, or degree of differentiation, of the tumor. For cancers, the grade is a measurement of how closely the tumor cells resemble the parent tissue (organ of origin). Well differentiated tumor cells closely resemble the tissue from the organ of origin. Poorly differentiated and undifferentiated tumor cells are disorganized and abnormal looking; they bear little or no resemblance to the tissue from the organ of origin. Pathologists describe the tumor grade by levels of s imilarity. Pathologists may define the tumor by describing two levels of similarity (two -grade system which may be used for colon); by describing three levels of similarity (three -grade system); or by describing four levels of similarity (four -grade system ). The four -grade system describes the tumor as grade I, grade II, grade III, and grade IV (also called well differentiated, moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated, and undifferentiated/anaplastic). These similarities/differences may be based on pattern (architecture), cytology, or nuclear features or a combination of these elements depending upon the grading system that is used. The information from this data item is useful for determining prognosis. Cell Indicator (Codes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) Cell indicator codes describe the lineage or phenotype of the cell that became malignant. The codes apply to lymphomas and leukemias. Cell indicator codes take precedence over grade/differentiation codes for lymphoma and leukemia cases. See the ICD -O-3 chapter Morphology for further instructions on coding grade. Codes 1 Grade I; grade i; grade 1; well differentiated; differentiated, NOS 2 Grade II; grade ii; grade 2; moderately differentiated; moderately well differentiated; intermediate differentiation 3 Grade III; grade iii, grade 3; poorly differentiated; -B; B-precursor 7 Null cell; No n T-non B 8 NK cell (natural killer cell) (effective with diagnosis 1/1/1995 and after) 9 Grade/differentiations unknown, not stated, or not applicable Coding Instructions Case and FU Data 103 A. Code the grade from the final diagnosis in the pathology r eport. If there is more than one path report, and the grades in the final diagnoses differ, code the highest grade for the primary site from any pathology report. B. If grade is not stated in the final pathology diagnosis, use the information in the microscopic section, addendum, consult, or comment to code grade. C. If more than one grade is recorded for a single tumor, code the highest grade, even if it is a focus. D. Code the grade from the primary tumor only, never from a metastati c site or a recurrence. E. Code the grade for all unknown primaries to 9 (unknown grade) unless grade is explicit by histology (i.e. anaplastic carcinoma - grade = 4). F. Code the grade of the invasive component when the tumor has both in situ and invasive portions. If the invasive component grade is unknown, code the grade as unknown (9). In situ tumors are not always graded. Code the grade if it is specified for an in situ lesion unless there is an invasive component. Do not code the in s itu grade if the tumor has both in situ and invasive components. G. Do not code the grade assigned to dysplasia , i.e.: High grade dysplasia (adenocarcinoma in situ) or VIN grade III would be coded to 9 (unknown grade). H. For sites other than breast, prostate and kidney, code the tumor grade using the following priority order: 1) terminology; 2) histologic grade; 3) nuclear grade. When coding grade from terminology for sites which use a three- grade system (peritoneum, endometrium, bladder, etc), consult the conversion table to determine the correct code. I. Code the grade of tumor given on a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) report if there is no tissue diagnosis (pathology or cytology report). Use the MRI or PET grade only when there is no tissue diagnosis. J. Some terms in ICD -O-3 carry an implied statement of grade. These histologies must be reported with the correct grade as stated below even if another grade is given or the primary site is unknown (C80.9): 8020/34 Carcinoma, undifferentiated Terminology Conversion Table Description Grade SEER Code Differentiated, NOS I 1 2009 Abstractor's Manual 104 Well differentiated I 1 Fairly well differentiated II 2 Intermediate differentiation II 2 Low grade I-II 2 Mid differentiated II 2 Moderately differentiated II 2 Moderately well differentiated II 2 Partially differentiated II 2 Partially well differentiated I-II 2 Relatively or generally well differentiated II 2 Medium grade, intermediate grade II-III 3 Moderately poorly differentiated III 3 Moderately undifferentiated III 3 Poorly differentiated III 3 Relatively poorly differentiated III 3 Relatively undifferentiated III 3 Slightly differentiated III 3 Dedifferentiated III 3 High grade III-IV 4 Undifferentiated, anaplastic, not differentiated IV 4 Non-high grade 9 - Two -Grade System Two grade systems apply to colon, rectosigmoid junction, rectum (C18.0- C20.9), and heart (C38.0). Code these sites using a two- grade system - Low Grade (2) or High Grade (4). If the grade is listed as 1/2 or as Low Grade, use code 2. If the grade is listed as 2/2 or as High Grade, use code 4. Code Terminology Histologic Grade 2 Low grade 1/2 4 High grade 2/2 Case and FU Data 105 -Three- Grade System There are several sites for which a three- grade system is used: breast, peritoneum, endometrium, fallopian tubes, prostate, kidney, bladder, brain and spinal cord, and soft tissue sarcoma. The patterns of cell growth are measured on a scale of 1, 2, and 3 (also referred to as low, medium, and high grade). This system measures the proportion of cancer cells that are gr owing and making new cells and how closely they resemble the cells of the host tissue. Thus, it is similar to a four -grade system, but simply divides the spectrum into three rather than four categories (see comparison table below). The expected outcome is more favorable for lower grades. If the grade is written as 2/3, that means this is a grade 2 of a 3 grade system; do not simply code the numerator. Use the following table to convert the grade to the correct code. See further instructions below for breas t, kidney, and prostate. CODE TERMINOLOGY 2 Low grade, partially well differentiated, grade 1 -2 or 1/3 (in 3- tier system), moderately differentiated, relatively well differentiated 3 Medium grade, grade 2-3 or 2/3 (in a 3 -tier system), intermediate grade, moderately undifferentiated, relatively undifferentiated; poorly differentiated; moderately poorly differentiated; slightly differentiated 4 High grade; grade 3 -4; grade 3/3 (in a 3- tier system); anaplastic; not differentiated -Breast (C50.0- C50.9) For breast cancers, code the tumor grade using the following priority order: 1) Bloom - Richardson (Nottingham) Scores; 2) Bloom -Richardson Grade; 3) Nuclear Grade; 4) Terminology; and 5) Histologic Grade as shown in the table below. BLOOM -RICHARDSON GRADING FOR BREAST CANCER Synonyms for the grading system modified Bloom - Richardson, SBR grading, BR Richardson gradi ng. The Bloom -Richardson grading scheme is based on numeric scores assigned to three different morphologic features of invasive breast cancers. It does not apply to the grading of DCIS tumors. The scores are condensed into 3 B -R grades; the B -R grades are then converted to the ICD -O-3 grade. See table: Code B-R Score B-R Grade Nuclear Grade ICD-O-3 Terminology Grade 1 3,4,5 Low grade 1/3;1/2 Well-differentiated 1/3 6,7 Intermediate 2/3 Moderately 2/3 2009 Abstractor's Manual 106 2 differentiated 3 8,9 High grade 2/2; 3/3 Poorly differentiated 3/3 -Kidney (C64.9) For kidney cancers, code the tumor grade using the following priority rules: 1) Fuhrman Grade; 2) Nuclear Grade; 3) Terminology (well diff, mod. diff); 4) Histologic Grade. These prioritization rules do not apply to Wilms tumor (M -8960). -Prostate (C61.9) For prostate cancers, code the tumor grade using the following priority order: 1) Gleason Score (this is the sum of the patterns, e.g., if the pattern is 2- 4, the score is 6); 2) Terminology; 3) Histologic Grade; and 4) Nuclear Grade. Gleason's Pattern Prostate cancers are commonly graded using Gleason's score or pattern. Gleason's grading is based on a 5 -component system, meaning it is based on 5 histologic patterns. The pathologist will evaluate the primary (majority) and secondary patterns for the tumor. The pattern is written as a range, with the majority pattern appearing first and the secondary pattern as the last number. Gleason's Score The patterns are added together to create a score. If the pathology report contains only one number , and that number is less than or equal to 5, it is a pattern. If the pathology report contains only one number , and that number is greater than 5 , it is a score. If the pathology report specifies a specific nu mber out of a total of 10, the first number given is the score. If there are two numbers other than 10 , assume they refer to two patterns. The first number is the primary pattern and the second is the secondary pattern. Use the following table to convert G leason's pattern or score into CPDMS codes: Gleason Conversion Table Code Gleason's Score (sum of primary and secondary patterns) Terminology Histologic Grade 1 2, 3, 4 Well differentiated I 2 5, 6 Moderately differentiated II 3 7, 8, 9, 10 Poorly differentiated III Special Coding Situations Case and FU Data 107 - Leukemias and Lymphomas For lymphomas and leukemias, the T -cell and B -cell designations have precedence over grading or differentiation. If marker studies are not documented in the record, then code information on cell type from any source (i.e., history & physical). Do not use \"high grade\" or \"low grade\" descriptors for lymphomas as for differentiation. However, a poorly -differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma should be coded in the 6th digit of the morphology code. Some lymphomas must carry either the implied grade or th e T-cell, B -cell, null cell designation as grade. For example: lymphocytic, -Precursor, T -cell phenotype, Pre -cell Pre 7 cell, Non -T non -B, Common Cell 8 NK (Natural Killer) cell, Nasal NK/T cell lymphoma 9 Combined T cell and B cell, or not determined, not stated - Brain Tumors \u00b7 Grade differentiated), Code 1; II (intermediate differentiation), Code 2; III (poorly differentiated), Code 3; IV (anaplastic), Code 4. \u00b7 Do not automatically code glioblastoma multiforme as Grade IV if no grade is given, code 9 (unknown). \u00b7 For primary tumors of the brain and spinal cord (C71.0- C72.9) do not record the WHO grade as the tumor Gr ade/Differentiation; record the WHO grade in the data item CS Site-Specific Factor 1 . \u00b7 All benign and borderline intracranial tumors should be coded grade 9. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 108 30140 - CLASS OF CASE Field Length: 1 Enter the one digit code that describes the class of case for this patient at the time he/she was first seen at your facility for this primary. These class codes identify cases and the manner in which they must be reported to the KCR. Analytic 0 = Any case diag nosed at your facility, since the registry reference date, for whom all therapy was documented as received elsewhere. (Patients who were not treatable should be included under \"1\".) 1 = Any case diagnosed at your institution. They also fulfill one of the following treatment situations: - Patient receives all or part of their first course of therapy at your institution. - Patient refused any treatment. - Patient was untreatable or was given palliative care only, because of age, advanced disease, o r other medical conditions. - Specific treatment was recommended but not received at your institution and it is unknown if treatment was ever administered. - It is unknown if treatment was recommended or administered. - Patient diagnosed at your inst itution prior to your reference date, all or part of first course of therapy received at your institution after your reference date. - Patient first diagnosed and had staging workup at your institution and all or part of the first course of therapy was received in a staff physician's office. - Patient diagnosed in a staff physician's office and is then treated at your institution. 2 = Any case diagnosed elsewhere, but the patient receives all or part of first course of therapy at your hospital. Any case diagnosed elsewhere, and your facility provided palliative care in lieu of first course treatment, or as part of first course treatment. Nonanalytic 3 = Any case diagnosed and first treated elsewhere, but receiving subsequent therapy at your institution. Any case treated at your institution for which no information regarding first course of treatment is available. Case and FU Data 109 Any case for which your facility developed a treatment plan or provided \"second opinion\" services, but the diagnosis and trea tment were provided elsewhere. Patients treated for recurrence or progression of a previously diagnosed malignancy. 4 = Any case diagnosed and treated at your facility prior to your reference date, but receives subsequent treatment at your facility after your reference date. 5 = Any case first diagnosed at autopsy at your facility. There was no suspicion of cancer before the autopsy. 8 = Case diagnosed by Death Certificate only. This should only be entered by central registry staff. 9 = Case diagnosed and/or treated only at an outpatient or nonhospital facility. This code should only be used by central registry staff. X = Case reported to KCR from an out -of-state registry. This code is used by central office staff only. (Refer to the \" Case Reporting Requirements \" section of this manual for a discussion of Classes and KCR requirements.) 2009 Abstractor's Manual 110 30150 - DATE OF FIRST CONTACT Field Length: 8 The date of first contact is the date of the facility's first inpatient or outpatient contact with the patient for diagnosis or treatment of the cancer. In most instances, it is the patient's physical presence at the facility that denotes \"contact.\" When a pat hology specimen is collected off -site and submitted to the facility to be read (and the specimen is positive for cancer), the case is not required by KCR to be abstracted unless additional contact with the facility occurs. If the patient subsequently receives first course treatment at the facility, the case is analytic and must be abstracted and followed. The Date of First Contact is the date the patient reported to the facility for the treatment or pre -treatment work -up; and the Class of Case i s 1 if the diagnosing physician has admitting privileges at the facility or 2 for any other physician. When a staff physician performs a biopsy off -site and the specimen is not submitted to the facility to be read, the case is not required to be abstract ed unless the patient receives some first course care at the facility. If the patient subsequently receives first course treatment at the facility, the case is analytic and must be abstracted and followed. The Date of First Contact is the date the patie nt reported to the facility for the treatment or pre -treatment work -up and the Class of Case is 1. For class of case 5 (diagnosed at autopsy) and class of case 8 (death certificate only) cases, enter the date of death. Case and FU Data 111 30160 - DATE OF DIAGNOSIS Field Length: 8 Enter the month, day, and year of the initial diagnosis. This field refers to the date of first diagnosis of this cancer by a recognized medical pra ctitioner. This is the date of the first clinical diagnosis, and in some cases, the diagnosis may never be histologically confirmed. Do not change the date of diagnosis when a later biopsy or cytology provides confirmation of a clinical diagnosis. From 20 09 forward, for cases which are diagnosed in utero, record the actual date of diagnosis. For pre -2009 cases, the date of diagnosis for in utero cases should be the date of birth. Code the date using a zero to precede single digit days, or months, i.e., June is entered as 06. If the exact date is not known, record the best approximation on the basis of available information. As possible guidelines, consider the following: a. For patients diagnosed without positive tissue while in a hospital, the date of admission may be used as the best estimate of the date of diagnosis. b. For patients diagnosed before entering the hospital (i.e., clinic or physician's office), the date of first admission may be used if it seems that the patient was hospitalized within three months or less from the true date of diagnosis by the referring physician. c. If the only information is \"Spring of\", \"Middle of the year\", or \"Fall\", approximate these as April 1st, July 1st, or October 1st, respectively . The date of death is the date of diagnosis for a class of case 5. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 112 30170 - Age at Diagnosis Field Length: 3 This field is calculated by the computer for the primary malignancy that is being abstracted.

It counts the occurrence of independent, malignant primaries that are required to be reported to the ACoS for approved cancer programs. The sequence number 00 indicates that this patient has one primary cancer. The sequence 01 indicates that the case is the first of multiple primaries. Sequence numbers in the range of 60 -88 have a special meaning to ACoS. They are reserved for conditions that are collected by the registry but are not required by ACoS. These include diagnoses required by KCR but not ACoS (such as VIN III, VAIN III, and AIN III, as well as invasive recurrences abstracted after an in -situ cancer.) Pre- invasive carcinomas of the cervix that were diagnosed in 1996 and 1997 will be sequenced in this range also, because they were required by KCR at the time, but not ACoS. As of January 1, 2004, benign and borderline intracranial tumors became reportable to ACoS as well as KCR. These are sequenced in the 60 -88 series. Codes (conditions reportable to ACoS): 00 One p rimary only 01 First of two or more primaries 02 Second of two or more primaries 03 Third of three or more primaries -- (Actual number of this primary) 35 Thirty fifth primary 60 First of non- ACoS reportable condi tion (i.e. VIN III, VAIN III, AIN III, CIN III, CIS of cervix) or benign intracranial tumor 61 Second of non- ACoS reportable condition -- 87 Twenty seventh non- ACoS reportable condition This field will automatically be calculated by the computer based on the CPDMS sequence number for this case and the number and types of primaries stored for this patient. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 120 30240 - SEER SEQUENCE NUMBER Field Lengt h: 2 The SEER sequence number represents the order of all primary reportable tumors diagnosed during a patient's lifetime. It counts the occurrence of independent, malignant primaries that are required to be reported to the SEER Program. The sequence number 00 indicates that this patient has one primary cancer. The sequence 01 indicates that the case is the first of multiple primaries. Sequence numbers in the range of 60 -88 have a special meaning to SEER. They are reserved for conditions that are collected by the registry but are not required to be reported to SEER. These include all basal and squamo us cell carcinomas of the skin diagnosed and reported before 2003 (C44._ with M8000- M8110) as well as all pre -invasive carcinomas of the cervix diagnosed in 1996 and 1997. As of January 1, 2004, benign and borderline intracranial tumors became reportable to SEER as well as KCR. These are sequenced in the 60 -88 series. Codes (conditions reportable to SEER): 00 One primary only 01 First of two or more primaries 02 Second of two or more primaries 03 Third of three or more prim aries -- (Actual number of this primary) 60 First of non- SEER reportable condition (i.e. basal cell skin cancer) 61 Second of non- SEER reportable condition -- 87 Twenty seventh of non- SEER reportable conditions This field will automatically be calculated by the computer based on the CPDMS sequence number for this case and the number and types of primaries stored for this patient. Case and FU Data 121 30250 - ADDRESS AT DIAGNOSIS - LINE 1 Field Length: 40 This field is automatically filled in with the address entered in Item 10060 (Current Address) when the case is initially entered in CPDMS.net Note that if the patient has multiple tumors, the address may be different for subsequent primaries. This address is a part of the patient's case data and has multiple uses. It is used in geocoding and allows referral pattern reports and analysis of cancer clusters or environmental studies. These data may be corrected (if erroneous), but never update the address at diagnosis if the patient moves. Changing this field would destroy its usefulness. If it is necessary to edit this field, follow the street address guidelines in Item 10060 . 2009 Abstractor's Manual 122 30260 - ADDRESS AT DIAGNOSIS - LINE 2 Field Length: 40 This field is automatically filled in with the data in Item 10070 (Current Street Addres s- Line 2) when the case is initially entered into CPDMS.net. It provides space to record additional address information, such as the name of a nursing home, apartment complex, etc. This line will be used as an alternate address line for geocoding. If Add ress at Diagnosis- Line 1 cannot be geocoded (i.e. PO Box), then this line will be reviewed for a geocode. Do not update this item if the patient's address changes. Leave this field blank if the additional address space is not needed.

The state code for Kentucky is 21. The county codes for Kentucky and its contiguous states are listed in Appendix D . CPDMS.net automatically calculates the correct co unty code from the address at diagnosis if the state is Kentucky and the ZIP code is within a single county. If a Kentucky ZIP code encompasses more than one county, the use must fill in this field. The U.S. Census Bureau web site has a helpful feature w hich displays the county (along with other information) of a particular address. The URL is http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/AGSGeoAddressServlet?_lang=en&_programYear=50&_tre eId=420 . Use Appendix D to code the state/county code for neighboring states. Use code '00998' for any county outside Kentucky and its neighboring states. Use code '00999' for unknown county of residence at diagnosis. If the patient moves, do not change this code . It should remain the same as it was at the time this primary malignancy was diagnosed.

It identifies all cases, including DCO and autopsy only, which are accessioned based only on ambiguous terminology. Registrars are required to collect cases based on ambiguous terminology in the diagnosis and it is advantageous to be able to identi fy those cases in the database. Definitions Phrase Definition Examples Ambiguous terminology Terms which have been mandated as reportable when used in a diagnosis. See page 3 of the FORDS Manual for detailed instructions on how to use the list. Clini cal: a physician's statement that the patient most likely has lung cancer. Laboratory tests: A CBC suspicious for leukemia. Pathology: A prostate biopsy compatible with adenocarcinoma. Conclusive terminology A clear and definite statement of cancer. The statement may be from a physician (clinical diagnosis), or may be from a laboratory test, autopsy, cytologic findings, and/or pathology. Clinical: a physician's statement that the patient has lung cancer. Laboratory tests: A CBC diagnostic of acute leukemia. Cytologic findings: A FNA (fine needle aspiration) with findings of infiltrating duct carcinoma of the breast. Pathology: A colon biopsy showing adenocarcinoma. List of Ambiguous Terms Apparent(ly) Most likely Appears Presumed Comparable with Probable Compatible with Suspect(ed) Consistent with Suspicious (for) Favor(s) Typical (of) Malignant appearing 2009 Abstractor's Manual 144 Code Label Definition Time Frame 0 Conclusive term There was a conclusive diagnosis within 60 days of the original diagnosis. Case was accessioned based on conclusive terminology. Includes all diagnostic methods such as clinical diagnosis, cytology, pathology, etc. Within 60 days of the date of initial diagnosis 1 Ambiguous term only The case was accessioned based only on ambiguous terminology. There was not conclusive terminology during the first 60 days following the initial diagnosis. Includes all diagnostic methods except cytology. Note : Cytology is excluded because registrars are not required to collect cases with ambiguous terms describing a cytology diagnosis. N/A 2 Ambiguous term followed by conclusive term The case was originally assigned a code 1 (was accessioned based only on ambiguous terminology). More than 60 days after the initial diagnosis, the information is being updated to show that a conclusive diagnosis was made by any diagnostic method includin g clinical 60 days or more after the date of diagnosis Case and FU Data 145 diagnosis, cytology, pathology, autopsy, etc. 9 Unknown term There is no information about ambiguous terminology. N/A Coding Instructions 1. Use code 0 when a case is accessioned based on conclusive terminology. The diagnosis includes clear and definite terminology describing the malignancy within 60 days of the original diagnosis. Note : Usually the patient undergoes a diagnostic work- up because there is a suspicion of cancer (ambig uous terminology). For example, a mammogram may show calcifications suspicious for intraductal carcinoma; the date of the mammogram is the date of initial diagnosis. When there is a clear and definite diagnosis within 60 days of that mammogram (date of initial diagnosis), such as the pathology from an excisional biopsy showing intraductal carcinoma, assign code 0. 2. Use code 1 when a case is accessioned based on ambiguous terminology and there is no clear and definite terminology used to describe the malignancy within 60 days of the date of initial diagnosis. The diagnosis may be from a pathology report, a radiology report, an imaging report, or in the medical record. 3. Use code 2 when a case is accessioned based on ambiguous terminology followed by clear and definite more than 60 days after the initial diagnosis. 4. Follow back to a physician or subsequent readmission (following the initial 60 day period) may eventually confirm cancer (conclusive cancer term more than 60 days after ambiguous term). Assign code 2. 5. Leave this data item blank for cases diagnosed prior to 1/1/2007. 6. Cases accessioned based on ambiguous terminology (code 1) should be excluded from case selection in research studies. Direct patient contact is not recommended. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 146 30460 - DATE OF CONCLUSIVE TERMINOLOGY Item Length: 8 This data item is effective with cases diagnosed on or after January 1, 2007. For those cases originally accessioned based on ambiguous terminology only, this data item documents the date of a definite statement of malignancy. The abstractor will change the code for the data item Ambiguous Terminology from a 1 to a 2 and enter the date that the malignancy was described clearly and definitely in the Date of Conclusive Terminology. Date Record the date in month, day, year format (MMDDCCYY) that the malignancy was described with conclusive terminology a t least 60 days after it was initially diagnosed by ambiguous terminology.

Case and FU Data 147 30470 - DIAGNOSTIC CONFIRMATION Field Length: 1 Record the one digit code that describes the method by which this diagnosis was confirmed. This is a priority coding scheme wit h the lowest number taking precedence over all higher numbers. This data item must be updated to a lower code if a more definitive method confirms the diagnosis at any time during the course of the disease. 1 = positive histology - use when microscopic examination of tissue reveals tumor such as from a biopsy, surgery, autopsy, or D & C. Also include here positive bone marrow specimens for leukemia diagnoses. Use code 1 for hematologic confirmation of leukemia, (i.e., peripheral blood smear). This code s upersedes all other codes when it is an appropriate choice. 2 = positive cytology - use when microscopic examination of cells (rather than tissue) such as pap smears, bronchial washings, gastric, spinal or pleural fluid, fine needle aspirate, etc. reveals tumor without a biopsy being done. 4 = positive microscopic confirmation, NOS (not otherwise specified) - use this code if microscopic examination was done but detailed information on the method is not available. 5 = positive laboratory test or ma rker study - use when the lab tests or markers studies are indicative of a clinical diagnosis of cancer (i.e. CBC for myelodysplastic syndrome). 6 = direct visualization without microscopic confirmation - use when procedures such as laryngoscopy, endosc opy, exploratory laparotomy, etc. are done which reveal tumor but no microscopic examination was done. 7 = radiography - use when imaging techniques such as x -rays, scans, GI series, barium enema, IVP, mammograms, venograms, arteriograms, air contrast studies, etc. indicate tumor in the absence of microscopic confirmation. 8 = clinical diagnosis - use when the diagnostic procedure does not fit in previous categories 1- 7. This may include palpation, or other unspecified tests. If a physician treats a patient for cancer, in spite of a negative biopsy, this is a reportable clinical diagnosis. Also, if a physician continues to describe a patient as having a reportable tumor, even after reviewing negative pathology results, this too is a reportable clinica l diagnosis. 9 = unspecified or unknown - use when the record does not reveal the method of diagnosis. This may occur when the patient was diagnosed elsewhere and the history is not available. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 148 30480 - Path ology Report Number Field Length: 15 Record the pathology report number from which the diagnosis of cancer was made. The field allows for 15 characters - start entering in the leftmost box and leave any trailing boxes blank. Case and FU Data 149 SEER Extent of Disease The extent of disease scheme used for cases diagnosed after 1988 by SEER is composed of: Size of Primary Tumor (3 digits) Extension (2 digits) plus 2 additional digits for prostate pathologic extent Lymph Nodes (1 digit) Number of Positive Regional Lymph Nodes (2 digits) Number of Regional Lymph Nodes Examined (2 digits) The codes and coding instructions for the SEER Extent of Disease --1988 are detailed in SEER Extent of Disease Codes -- 1988, Codes and Coding I nstructions , third edition (revised in 1998). This reference contains the site specific codes for items 30490, 30510, 30520, and 30530: tumor size, SEER extension, prostate pathologic extent, and lymph node involvement. Extent of Disease should include all information available within four months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression or through completion of surgery(ies) in first course treatment, whichever is longer. Except for tumor size, Extent of Disease information obtained after treatm ent with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or immunotherapy may be included. All schemes apply to all histologies, unless otherwise noted. The priority for using information is pathologic, operative and clinical findings. For \"Death Certificate Only\" cases, this field is to be coded '999999999' except for death certificate only prostate cases, which are coded '999909999990'. NOTE: This EOD coding scheme is required by KCR for cases diagnosed from 1- 1-2000 through 12- 31-2003. As of January 1, 2004, data in fields 30490- 30530 - Tumor Size, SEER Extent, Pathologic Extent for Prostate, and SEER Lymph Node Involvement - will no longer be collected. Instead, this information will be captured in the Collaborative Stage fields 30540- 30680 . The number of regional lymph nodes examined and positive will continue to be collected as before 2004. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 150 30490 - TUMOR SIZE Field Length: 3 DO NOT CODE THIS FIELD FOR CANCERS DIAGNOSED ON OR AFTER 1 -1-2004. INSTEAD, RECORD TUMOR SIZE IN ITEM 30540 ACCORDING TO INSTRUCTIONS IN THE COLLABORATIVE STAGING MANUAL. If the diagnosis date is before 1- 1-2004, record the size of the tumor here in millimeters as stated in the pathology report. If more than one dimension is recorded, code the greatest one. For example, 6.1 x 9.4 cm should be recorded as 094. To convert centimeters to millimeters, multiply centimeters by 10. If the tumor size is stated in millimeters, such as \"breast tumor is 13 mm,\" code as 013. Use the instructions in the SEER Extent of Disease 1998 Codes and Coding Instructions manual, pages 3 -5 and the tables that follow, to code this fie ld. If the pathology report does not specify tumor size, a reasonable estimate should be entered from the surgical notes, from scans or radiologic reports, or other clinical findings in that order. If unknown, code '999'. Use the charts and tables on the following pages for additional guidelines in coding this field. EXCEPTIONS: For melanomas of the skin, vulva, penis, scrotum, and conjunctiva, use this field to record the DEPTH OF INVASION (thickness of tumor) - and not largest tumor dimension - in HUNDREDTHS OF MILLIMETERS. For example, a melanoma with 1.55 mm depth of invasion should be coded 155. A melanoma of 9.9 mm or greater should be coded 990. For melanomas of the uvea and other parts of the eye (C69.1- C69.4, C69.8 - C69.9), as well as any other anatomic sites, record the tumor size at largest dimension and not depth of invasion. For mycosis fungoides and Sezary's disease, use this field to record PERIPHERAL BLOOD INVOLVEMENT instead of tumor size. For Hodgkin' s and non- Hodgkin's lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma, use this field to record HIV STATUS instead of tumor size. You may round off if the size is more precise than the coding spaces available. For example: -ovarian tumor is 16.75 cm - code 168 -skin mel anoma is 4.668 mm thick - code 467 Case and FU Data 151 Find the type of cancer you are abstracting in the left column. Then follow across the row to see the instructions for coding the field 'Tumor Size' for that type of cancer. TYPE OF CANCER ABSTRACTING GUIDELINES 1.

As of 1 -1-2004, leave this field blank and code information in the Collaborative Stage item #30540 instead. Code the farthest documented extension of tumor away from the primary site, either by contiguous extension or distant metastasis. The description of the primary tumor growth within the organ of origin or its extension to neighboring organs, or its metastasis to distant sites is summarized in a two -digit code. It is a hierarchical code in which the most extensive disease is all that is coded. Thus, information about the extent of the tumor within the primary site is lost if the tumor extends to neighboring organs, and extension to neighboring organs is lost if there is distant metastasis. C ode '99' is reserved for unknown extension, except for prostate. Use the instructions in the SEER Extent of Disease 1998 Codes and Coding Instructions manual, page 7, and the tables that follow, to code this field. This field must match the behavior code.

Nodes which are considered \"regional nodes\" are defined by primary site in the AJCC Manual for Staging of Cancer . 2009 Abstractor's Manual 158 30540- 30680 - COLLABORATIVE STAGING Collaborative Staging (CS) is to b e used for cases diagnosed on or after January 1, 2004. It is not to be used for cases diagnosed prior to that date. Its introduction does not affect CoC requirements for physicians to assign AJCC staging or the requirement that the physician - assigned stag ing values be recorded in the registry. Collaborative Staging was designed for registrar use. For Collaborative Staging, registrars code discrete pieces of information once and the CS computer algorithm derives the values for AJCC T, N, M and Stage Group , Summary Stage 1977, and Summary Stage 2000. The derived stage codes are ideally suited for data analysis because of the consistency that can be obtained with objectively -recorded, identically -processed data items. The timing rule for CS coding was desi gned to make use of the most complete information possible to yield the \"best stage\" information for the tumor at the time of diagnosis -- \"use all information gathered through completion of surgery(ies) in first course of treatment or all information avail able within four months of the date of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, whichever is longer .\" Disease progression is defined as further direct extension or distant metastasis known to have developed after the diagnosis was established. Information about tumor extension, lymph node involvement, or distant metastasis obtained after disease progression is documented should be excluded from the CS coding. The following CS data items are coded by the registrar. 30540. CS Tumor Size 30550. CS Extension 30560. CS Tumor Size/Ext Eval 30570. CS Lymph Nodes 30580. CS Reg Lymph Nodes Eval 30590. Regional Lymph Nodes Examined 30600. Regional Lymph Nodes Positive 30610. CS Mets at DX 30620. CS Mets Eval 30630- 30680. CS Site -Specific Factors 1- 6, for some sites The CS algorithm produces the output items listed below. The derived AJCC items are separate from the physician -coded items; and the derived Summary Stage items are separate from the manually -coded items collected by the CoC in the past. The derived items cannot be manually entered. 30790. Derived AJCC T Code 30800. Derived AJCC Derived AJCC N Code 30830. Derived AJCC N Text Case and FU Data 159 30810. Derived AJCC N Descriptor 30850. Derived AJCC Derived M Derived Stage 30690. Derived SS1977 30710. Derived SS2000 Like the AJCC and Summary Stage codes that are derived from it, CS is a site- specific staging system. The CS algorithm uses tumor site and histology to determine which CS schema to apply. Depending on the schema, the coding instructions and code definitions will vary. Collaborative Staging codes are defined for every site and histology combination. The AJCC Cancer Staging Manual does not cover all sites, and some histologies are excluded from sites with an AJCC coding scheme. When the CS algorithm processes a site -histology combination that does not have an applicable AJCC code, it assigns the display string \"NA\" for \"Not applicable.\" A blank display string for a derived item means the CS algorithm was not run for the case. Coding CS Items The complete i nstructions and site -histology defined codes are available in the Collaborative Staging Manual and Coding Instructions (CS Manual) version 1.04.00. Part I provides general instructions and the instructions and codes for generic (non site -specific) items. P art II contains the site -specific instructions and codes. The CS Manual and related information is available electronically on the AJCC Web site: http://www.cancerstaging.org/cstage/CSMa nual010400.pdf . For an easily navigable web -based list of site -specific schema and coding instructions, go to http://web.facs.org/cstage/schemalist.htm . Code the CS items for every analytic case. R ead the medical record carefully to identify the primary site and histology and determine their ICD -O-3 codes. While you are reviewing the record, make mental notes about the tissues and lymph nodes that are involved by tumor. If the histology for the appropriate histology -site combination. Otherwise, turn to the correct site -specific schema in Part II of the CS Manual . Schemas are in ICD -O-3 order by the first code that uses the schema. Verify that you are in the correct chapter by confirming that the code is in the list a t the beginning of the schema. Begin assigning codes for the 15 Collaborative Staging data items. Be sure to read the notes and follow the site/histology -specific instructions at the beginning of each item. Some schemas may have site- specific factors ass ociated with extension, lymph nodes or metastasis; keep these in mind as you assign the codes. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 160 Code the tumor size in the CS Tumor Size item. Code how far the tumor has spread directly in the CS Extension item. Code how the farthest tumor spread was dete rmined in the CS Tumor Size/Ext Eval item. Code whether regional lymph nodes are involved in the CS Lymph Nodes item. Code how the farthest lymph node spread was determined in the CS Reg Node Eval item. Code the number of positive regional lymph nodes from the pathology report in the Regional Nodes Positive item. Code the number of regional lymph nodes examined by the pathologist in the Regional Nodes Examined item. Code the farthest distant metastasis (including distant lymph nodes) in the CS Mets at Dx item. Code how the distant metastasis was determined in the CS Mets Eval item. Code the six CS Site -Specific Factors . If the first site -specific factor is listed as \"Not Applicable,\" then code 888 in all site -specific factors. Otherwise, code the specific information requested for each site -specific factor. When the next site- specific factor is 888 (Not Applicable), all the remaining site -specific factors will also be 888. The derived stage information will be calculated when the case is saved, or prior to exiting the case. When the computer derives the final stage information, the program will check the histology code and other coded information to determine whether T, N, M and Stage Group will be generated for the case. If the histology code is on the comp uter's exceptions list for that site, the T, N, M, and Stage Group will be reported as \"Not Applicable.\" Summary Stage is generated for every case. Site-Specific Factors Some schemas require prognostic information not required for most sites. CS Site -Specific Factors 1- 6 are designed to collect that information. The schemas that make use of one or more site-specific factors are: \u00b7 Head and Neck \u00b7 Colon \u00b7 Rectosigmoid, rectum \u00b7 Liver \u00b7 Malignant melanoma of Skin, Vulva, Penis, Scrotum \u00b7 Mycosis F ungoides \u00b7 Breast \u00b7 Ovary \u00b7 Placenta \u00b7 Prostate \u00b7 Testis \u00b7 Malignant melanoma of Conjunctiva \u00b7 Malignant melanoma of Iris and Ciliary Body \u00b7 Malignant melanoma of Other Eye Case and FU Data 161 \u00b7 Brain \u00b7 Thyroid \u00b7 Kaposi Sarcoma \u00b7 Hodgkin Lymphoma and Non- Hodgkin Lymphoma Using CS Derived Values Some differences in the ways that the CS algorithm operates and how the AJCC stage assignment rules are made can result in differences between the derived values for some patients and the physician -assigned stages. The differences o f most interest to registrars are those that might explain discrepancies between the derived AJCC T, N, M and Stage Group values and the values recorded for the same cases by physicians. First, as a \"best stage\" system, CS makes use of the most complete information available to stage the tumor. The AJCC Cancer Staging Manual distinguishes between clinical staging, based on information available prior to primary treatment, and pathologic st aging, based on information gathered as a product of the treatment process (particularly surgery). It also has specific rules governing how the components gathered at different times in the process may be combined. The CS algorithm derives a clinical (c) o r pathologic (p) descriptor for each of the T, N and M stage components based on the source of information used to validate the most extensive spread of the tumor, and uses the components to derive a stage group without reference to the value of the descri ptors. Some derived stage groups may involve combinations that are neither clinical nor pathologic according to AJCC rules, so a case that is unstageable for a physician applying AJCC rules may be assigned a Derived AJCC Stage Group value by the CS algorit hm. Other cases may involve combinations that do not match either the physician -assigned clinical stage or the pathologic stage. Second, the CS algorithm has a built -in set of histologies to which each site -specific CS schema applies when it derives AJCC stage and component values. That list, necessary for computer generation of derived values, is not as strictly defined by AJCC with respect to most sites. Consequently, it is possible a physician will provide an AJCC stage for a patient when the CS algori thm does not. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 162 30690 - SUMMARY STAGE 1977 Field Length: 1 For cases diagnosed after 1- 1-2004, this field will be calculated from the Collaborative Stage data items. For cases diagnosed from 1- 1-2001 to 12- 31-2003, this field will be calculated from the SEER Extent of Disease data items. For cases diagnosed prior to January 1, 2001, record the one digit code which describes the stage of disease at time of initial diagnosis and/or first treatment. Use all information available in the medical record within four months of the date of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression or through completion of first course surgery(ies), whichever is longer. Note that often surgical procedures will reveal the true anatomic extent of the disease at the time of first treatment and this inform ation may be used in staging this case. Refer to the Summary Staging Guide of the SEER Program to determine the general stage. Briefly described, they are: 0 = In-situ/non- invasive malignant tumor. The pathology report must state \"in -situ\". In addition there must be no evidence of invasion mentioned anywhere in the record in order for a tumor to be staged in this category. (The following synonyms may also be used instead of \"in-situ\": intraepithelial, intraepidermal, non -infiltrating, intraductal, or Bowen's Disease.) 1 = Localized - tumor is confined to the organ of origin. 2 = Regional by direct extension - tumor has spread by direct extension to immediately adjacent tissues or organs. 3 = Regional to lymph nodes - tumor has spread into lymph nodes regional to the primary site of origin. 4 = Regional by both direct extension and regional lymph nodes. 5 = Regional, NOS - tumor is regionally spread, but the extent of regional spread cannot be determined, or is not specified. 7 = Distant metastasis - a tumor that has spread beyond the immediately adjacent tissues and has developed secondary or metastatic tumors, has seeding or implants, or is systemic. Leukemia, multiple myeloma, reticuloendotheliosis, hematopoietic diseases, an d Letterer - Siwe's disease are always coded 7. Case and FU Data 163 9 = Unknown/Unstageable - Use when there is not enough information available to accurately determine the stage. Every effort should be made to determine the stage by thoroughly reviewing the record or obtaini ng information from a medical authority before using code 9. Code '9' should be used for unknown primaries , because staging for these cases is not applicable. In the case of patients first treated elsewhere and admitted to your hospital for a subsequen t course of treatment, enter the stage at the time of initial diagnosis, if it is known. If not, record the stage as \"Unknown\". Do not record the stage at the time of admission to your hospital for subsequent treatment. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 164 30700 - Summary Stage 1977 Display String Field Length: 5 This is the label which appears on screen or in reports and that corresponds to the code stored in Summary Stage 1977 ( item #30690 ).

The size of the untreated tumor (T) increases progressively, and at some point in time, regional lymph node involvement (N) and distant metastases (M) occur. A simple classification scheme, which can be incorporated into a form for staging and universally applied, is the goal of the TNM system. The staging scheme is detailed in the AJCC Manual for Staging of Cancer , now in its Sixth edition. NOTE: Cases diagnosed from 1989 -1992 used the AJCC Manual for Staging, Third Edition. The AJCC Manual, Fourth Edition, is starting with cases diagnosed from 1993 to 1997. The AJCC Manual, Fifth Edition , is used with cases diagnosed in 1998 to 2002. The AJCC Manual, Sixth Edition, is used with cases diagnosed in 2003 and after. NOTE: The CoC does not require class zero cases diagnosed on or after 1/1/2006 to be AJCC staged by the physician. The Workbook for Staging of Cancer, second edition, published by the National Cancer Registrars Association, is also recommended as a resource for additional and more detailed infor mation for coding AJCC stage. The TNM general rules applicable to all sites contained in the Sixth Edition are as follows: 1. All cases should be confirmed microscopically; however, this is not mandatory for staging. Any cases not confirmed microscop ically must be reported separately. This is possible by using the diagnostic confirmation field. NOTE: For 2008 diagnoses forward, ACoS requires clinical TNM staging assigned by a physician if available. If not available, these fields must be completed b y the registrar. Pathologic TNM is not required. For pre -2008 diagnoses, physician -assigned TNM stage is required for both clinical and pathologic staging in approved programs. Physicians may choose to record both the clinical and the path stage if appli cable. Registrars are required to report both if information is available from the physician. KCR requires only one TNM stage; pathologic if the information is available; otherwise clinical staging. 2. Two classifications are described for each site, n amely: a. Clinical classification, designated cTNM, in general is based on evidence acquired prior to first definitive treatment. b. Pathologic classification, designated pTNM, in general, is based on the evidence acquired before treatment, supplemented or modified by the additional evidence acquired from surgery and from pathologic examination of a resected specimen. This includes staging done from a post mortem examination. Consult each site specific chapter for the specific criteria requ ired for classifying a case as clinical versus pathologic stage. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 176 In instances when a biopsied primary tumor technically cannot be removed, or when it is unreasonable to remove it, and if the highest T and N, or the M1 category of the tumor can be confirmed microscopically, the criteria for pathologic classification and staging have been satisfied without total removal of the primary cancer. For Example: Lung Primary; Biopsy of lung - Positive; Severe cannot lesion; CT scan - liver mets; live r biopsy- positive Assign Pathologic stage. 3. All cases should use the following time guidelines for evaluating stage: through the first course of surgery, or 4 months, whichever is longer, in the absence of disease progression. 4. In cases where the histology does not match those listed in the site specific chapter used to stage the case, the following guideline applies: If the first 3 digits of the histology of the case being abstracted match the first 3 digits of any of the histologies listed in the chapter, it is appropriate to use that chapter to stage the case; otherwise the chapter cannot be used. 5. If there is doubt concerning the correct T, N, or M category to which a particular case should be allotted, then the lower (less advanced) c ategory should be chosen. This will also be reflected in the stage grouping. 6. In the case of multiple, simultaneous tumors in one organ, the tumor with the highest T category should be identified and the multiplicity will be recorded in the TNM descr iptor field. In simultaneous bilateral cancers of paired organs, each tumor should be classified independently whenever each is determined to be a separate primary. In tumors of the thyroid, liver, and ovary, as well as in nephroblastomas and neuroblastom as, multiplicity is a criterion of T classification. 7. In the case of a primary of unknown origin, staging will be based on reasonable clinical certainty of the primary organ. If reasonable clinical certainty is not obvious, the case cannot be stage d. For example, if a patient has brain metastases diagnosed by a computed tomographic (CT) imaging scan, and the physician records that the primary is probably lung, code the primary site to lung and use the lung classification system for staging. However, if a patient is noted to have metastatic disease to the liver, and the pathology report cites that the primary may be lung or colon, this case cannot be staged, unless the origin of the primary is documented elsewhere. 8. For in -situ classification, i f there is an acceptable histologic classification of in -situ carcinoma as determined by your pathologist, but it has not been specified in the AJCC chapter, it can be used to classify pTis. The correct classification for in -situ lesions is p Tis c N0 c M0, Clinical Stage Group 0. Since lymph nodes are generally not removed, the classification cannot be pTis p N0 cM0. PTis Nx Mx is considered not stageable . These cases will have only clinical confirmation of the lymph node and metastatic disease status. Case and FU Data 177 9. If pathologic assessment of lymph nodes reveals negative nodes but the number of examined lymph nodes is less than the suggested number for lymph node dissection, classify the N category as pN0. Only one lymph node is required to be removed for patholog ic staging. 10. Isolated tumor cells (ITC) are single tumor cells or small clusters of cells not more than 0.2 mm in greatest dimension that are usually detected by immunohistochemistry or molecular methods. Cases with ITC in lymph nodes or at distant s ites should be classified as N0 or M0, respectively. The same applies to cases with findings suggestive of tumor cells or their components by non morphologic techniques such as flow cytometry or DNA analysis. These cases should be analyzed separately and have special recording rules in the specific organ site. 11. Except where pM is positive, cM should be used along with pT and pN for calculating pathologic stage. \"pM0\" is not a valid concept. When physician and registrar disagree on correct TNM stage: In situations where the registrar disagrees with the TNM stage assigned by the physician, the registrar should attempt to resolve the discrepancy with the appropriate physician. It is also recommended that hospitals with ACoS approved cancer progr ams have these discrepancies reviewed by the Cancer Committee liaison to the registry if further resolution is needed. The physician's TNM classification and stage group should be recorded in the cancer registry database and the 'r;staged by' field should indicate physician. Any discussion or disagreement by the registrar and/or registry physician advisors should be recorded in text. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 178 30940 - TNM STAGING EDITION Field Length: 1 Record the appropriate code from the AJCC Manual for Staging of Cancer which describes the edition used to classify the extent of disease at the time of initial diagnosis and/or first treatment. 0 = Not Staged (sites that have an AJCC staging scheme but staging was not done) 1 = First Edition 2 = Second Edition 3 = Third Edition 4 = Fourth Edition 5 = Fifth Edition 6 = Sixth Edition 8 = Not applicable (sites that do not have a TNM staging scheme) 9 = Unknown edition Case and FU Data 179 30950 - cT Field Length: 3 The T evaluates only the primary tumo r. It reflects tumor size and/or extension. The clinical classification is based on information and evidence obtained before treatment. Use for sites that are accessible for clinical examination including cervix, oral cavity, and larynx. Use clinical classification for organs where only clinical findings evaluate the extent of disease. The physical examination, imaging, endoscopy, biopsy, surgical exploration, and other relevant findings are the basis of clinical staging. Evaluate the clinical stage of disease using all information available before the first cancer -directed treatment. If the value is only one digit, record to the left and leave the remaining spaces blank. Choose the lower (less advanced) T category when there is any uncertainty. Refer to the AJCC Manual for Staging of Cancer , Sixth Edition for coding rules. The following general definitions are used throughout the TNM classification. TX Primary tumor cannot be assessed or is unknown. T0 No evidence of a primary tumor. Tis Carcinom a in-situ. T1, T2, T3, and T4 describe increasing size and/or local extent of the primary tumor. Record '888' when the site/histology combination does not have a TNM staging scheme. If TNM staging is applicable to this site/histology, you may recor d X in the cT field if you document the pathologic TNM instead. ACoS facilities must record both the clinical and pathologic stage if available by a physician.

It reflects tumor size and/or extension. Pathologic classification is based on information obtained before treatment and supplemented by additional evidence from surgery and pathological examination of the resected specimen. It is a combination of all findings. The pathologic stage provides the most precise data to estimate prognosis and calculate end results. Pathologic assessment of the primary tumor requires a resection of the primary tumor or a biopsy adequate to evaluate the highest pT category. The pathologic assessment of the regional lymph nodes requires the removal of enough nodes to confirm the absence of regional lymph node metastasis and evaluate the highest pN category. Pathologic staging takes precedence over clinical, with the exceptions below. EXCEPTIONS: There are some diseases and sites for which clinical stag ing takes precedence. Clinical staging takes precedence when the patient has radiation or chemotherapy preoperatively and when the patient does not have cancer -directed surgery. Also, if pTNM results in StgGrp 9 and cTNM StgGrp is known, use the C Stage G roup. EXAMPLES: Cervical cancer treated preoperatively with radiation, breast cancer treated preoperatively with chemotherapy and radiation, prostate cancer biopsied and treated with hormones, small cell carcinoma of the lung biopsied and treated with chemotherapy. If the value is only one digit, record to the left and leave the second space blank. Truncate the least significant subdivision of the category from the right as needed. Choose the lower (less advanced) T category when there is any uncertaint y. Refer to the AJCC Manual for Staging of Cancer , Sixth Edition for coding rules. The following general definitions are used throughout the TNM classification. TX Primary tumor cannot be assessed or is unknown. T0 No evidence of a primary tumor. Tis Carcinoma in -situ. T1, T2, Tc, and T4 describe increasing size and/or local extent of the primary tumor. Record '888' when the site/histology does not have a TNM staging scheme. Record TX when the pathologic T value cannot be assessed because adequate information for staging is not available. The valid T codes are listed in item 30950 . Case and FU Data 187 31020 - pN Field Length: 2 The N classifies only the regional nodes. It describes the absence or presence and the extent of node metastases. The complete pathologic assessment of the regional lymph nodes (pN) ideally entails removal of a sufficient number of lymph nodes to evaluate the highest pN category. Exception: Sentinel node assessment may be appropriate for some sites and is clarified in chapter guidelines for those sites. The following gene ral definitions are used throughout the TNM classification: NX - Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed or status is unknown. N0 (including N0i -, N0i+, N0mol -, and N0mol+) - Nodes were assessed and there was no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis . There may have been positive findings for isolated tumor cells from special studies. See below. N1, N2, and N3 - indicate increasing involvement of regional lymph nodes. Classify a primary tumor that directly extends into lymph nodes as lymph node metastasis. Classify a metastatic nodule as lymph node metastasis when: - It is removed from the connective tissue in a lymph drainage area. - The nodule is larger than 2- 3 millimeters. - There is no histologic evidence of residual lymph node. - The nodule is grossly recognizable. NOTE: Evaluate the nodule in the T category (discontinuous extension) if it is microscopic (up to 2-3 millimeters). If pathologic assessment of lymph nodes reveals negative nodes but the number of examined lymph nodes is less than the suggested number for lymph node dissection, classify the N category as pN0. Isolated tumor cells (ITC) are single tu mor cells or small clusters of cells not more than 0.2 mm in greatest dimension that are usually detected by immunohistochemistry or molecular methods. Cases with ITC in lymph nodes or at distant sites should be classified as N0 (or I -, I+, M -, M+) or M0, respectively. The same applies to cases with findings suggestive of tumor cells or their components by nonmorphologic techniques such as flow cytometry or DNA analysis. These cases should be analyzed separately and have special recording rules in the speci fic organ site. If the value is only one digit, record to the left and leave the second space blank. Choose the lower (less advanced) N category when there is any uncertainty. Refer to the AJCC Manual for Staging of Cancer , Sixth Edition for coding rules . 2009 Abstractor's Manual 188 Record '88' if the site/histology does not have a TNM staging scheme. Case and FU Data 189 31030 - pM Field Length: 2 M records the presence or absence of distant metastases. Choose the lower (less advanced) M category when there is any uncertainty. The pathologic assessment of metastases may be either clinical or pathologic when the T and/or N categories meet the criteria for pathologic staging (pT, pN, cM, or pM). The following general definitions are used throughout the TNM classification: MX The presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed or is unknown. M0 Pathologic M0 is not a valid concept. The AJCC has determined that staging metastatic disease is clinical unless the presence of metastasis is pathologically confirmed. M1 Distant metastases are present. Some cancers have additional codes for specific sites of metastases. For example, prostate cancer has codes M1A, B, and C. Codes indicate site(s) 88 Not applicable Record a single digit in the space to the left and leave the remaining space blank.

Record '88' if the site/histology does not have a TNM staging scheme. Choose the lower (less advanced) stage grouping when ther e is any uncertainty. Note : For diagnoses prior to 2004, this field was used to calculate Best Stage Group. It becomes the Best Stage, unless the value is '88' or '99,' or pre -surgical treatment was administered.

Death certificate only cases. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 212 31250 - Systemic Therapy/Surgery Sequence Field Length: 1 This field only applies to cases diagnosed on or after January 1, 2006. It records the sequence of systemic therapy and surgical procedures given as part of first course treatment. Systemic therapy includes any chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy , transplants or endocrine surgeries. Surgical procedures include any surgery at the primary site, surgery of regional lymph nodes, or surgery at other regional or distant sites. It does not include non- definitive surgeries such as incisional biopsies or bypass surgeries. Code the administration of systemic therapy in sequence with the first surgery performed. The sequence of systemic therapy and surgical procedures given as part of the first course of treatment cannot always be determined using the d ate on which each modality was started or performed. If the systemic therapy and surgery were administered on the same day, any code 2- 9 could be appropriate. If there was no systemic therapy given or no definitive surgery performed, then code '0'. Code Label Definition 0 No systemic therapy and/or surgical procedures No systemic therapy was given; and/or no surgical procedure of primary site; no scope of regional lymph node surgery; no surgery to other regional site(s), distant site(s), or distant lymph node(s); or no reconstructive surgery was performed.

Case and FU Data 221 31340 - Census Tract 1970/80/90 Field Length: 6 For cases diagnosed prior to 1998, the census tract 1970/80/90 code identifies the patient's usual residence when the tumor was diagnosed. The central registry calculates this code from the patient's address at diagnosis. This field is available only in the KCR central registry database and is considered a confidential field. A census tract is a sm all statistical subdivision of a county. Census tract codes originate from the U.S. Census Bureau, and are constructed using the patient's address. Codes are available from state health departments or the U.S. Census Bureau. Census tracts change as the population changes. To interpret census tract, assume that the decimal point is between the fourth and fifth positions of the field. Add zeros to fill all six positions. EXAMPLE: Census tract 409.6 would be coded 040960, and census tract 516.21 would be c oded 051621. Special codes: 000000 Area is not census tracted 999999 Area is census tracted, but census tract is not available 2009 Abstractor's Manual 222 31350 - Census Tract Coding System Field Length: 1 A census tract is a small statistical subdivision of a county with (generally) between 2,500 and 8,000 residents. The boundaries of census tracts are established cooperatively by local committees and the Census Bureau. An attempt is made to keep the same boundaries from census to census so that historical comparability will be maintained. T his goal is not always achieved; old tracts may be subdivided due to population growth, disappear entirely, or have their boundaries changed. The census tract definition used to code the case's census tract field must be recorded so that data are correctl y grouped and analyzed. Codes 0 = Not tracted 1 = 1970 Census Tract Definition 2 = 1980 Census Tract Defintion 3 = 1990 Census Tract Definition (1988 + diagnoses) 4 = 2000 Census Tract Definitions (2000 + diagnoses) Case and FU Data 223 31370 - Census Tract 2000 Field Length: 6 This field records the census tract of a patient's residence at the time of diagnosis, using codes from the Year 2000 Census conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The central registry calculates this code from the patient's address at diagnosis using geocoding software. This field is available only in the KCR central registry database and is considered a confidential field. Census tract codes allow central registries to calculate incidence rates for geographical areas having population estimates. The Census Bureau provides population data for census tracts.

This readmission was unplanned. 2 A patient was surgically treated and was then readmitted to the same hospital within 30 days of being discharged. This readmission was planned (chemotherapy port insertion, revision of colostomy, etc.) 3 A patient was surgically treated and, within 30 days of being discharged, the patient had both a planned and an unplanned readmission to the same hospital. 9 It is unknown whether surgery of the primary site was recommended or performed. It is unknown whether the patient was readmitted to the same hospital within 30 days of discharge. Death certificate only. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 248 31710 - CASE TYPE ORI GINAL Field Length: 1 This field is automatically filled in by the computer. It indicates cases which were originally abstracted as case type 'S' (short forms). The use of short forms was discontinued by KCR and all existing short forms were converted to regular abstracts (case type 'A'). These converted cases have certain limitations regarding editing follow -up or adding therapy. Contact KCR technical support staff before attempting to edit cases in which case type original is S. Case and FU Data 249 31720 - CLASS HOSPITAL ID Field Length: 11 This calculated field displays the facility ID number of the hospital that owns the case. For a multi- facility database, this is the hospital with the highest class of case. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 250 31725 - Archive FIN Field Length: 10 This field identifies the CoC Facility Identification Number (FIN) of the facility at the time it originally accessioned the case. When a CoC approved facility merges with another facility or joins a network, its unique FIN may change. Archive FIN preserves the identity of the facility at the time the case was initially accessioned so that records resubmitte d subsequent to such a reorganization can be recognized as belonging to the same facility. Archive FIN is automatically coded by CPDMS.net. This item never changes and must be included as part of the patient record when data are submitted to the NCDB. For facilities that have not merged, Archive FIN and FIN are the same.

This includes skin other than the primary site. 58 Distant recurrence of an invasive tumor in lymph node only. Refer to the staging sche me for a description of lymph nodes that are distant for a particular site. 59 Distant systemic recurrence of an invasive tumor only. This includes leukemia, bone marrow metastasis, carcinomatosis, generalized disease. 60 Distant recurrence of an invasiv e tumor in a single distant site (51 -58) and local, trocar and/or regional recurrence (10 -15, 20- 25, or 30). 62 Distant recurrence of an invasive tumor in multiple sites (recurrences that can be coded to more than one category 51- 59). 70 Never disease -free 88 Recurred, site unknown 98 Flag indicating invasive recurrence after in -situ case (see box below) 99 Unknown if recurred Instructions to CPDMS.net users for abstracting an invasive recurrence that occurs for a previously diagnosed in-situ cancer: 1. When you become aware of the recurrence, update the Type of Recurrence field. If the behavior code on the case is 2 (in- situ), the only valid recurrence values are 06, 16, 17, 26, 27, 36, or 46. When you enter one of these values , a warning message pops up. WARNING: You have indicated an invasive recurrence on a case originally diagnosed as in -situ. This MUST be abstracted as a new primary with Behavior code 3 and Type of Recurrence = 98. 2. Press any key to remove the warning message. 3. Finish updating the in- situ case. 4. Then abstract the recurrence as a new invasive case diagnosed when the invasive recurrence was confirmed. Be sure to put 98 in the Type of Recurrence field on the invasive case in order t o exclude this case from being reported to ACoS. Case and FU Data 259 31800 - FIRST DISEASE FREE START DATE Field Length: 8 Enter the month, day, and year on which the patient was first considered disease -free. Use all information available in the chart when making an evaluation. If it appears that the patient is disease- free, but no exact date is known, make an estimate. The definition of disease -free status is related to the site of the cancer being studied. With solid tumors, the patient is considered disease -free when there is no reported clinical evidence of any residual tumor (i.e., the pathology report states that the margins are clear) and there is no evidence of cancer in any lymph nodes or metastatic sites. With leukemias, lymphomas, hematopoietic diseases, etc., complete remission is considered a disease -free status. When recording this information for the latter kinds of cases, enter a date only if the record indicates \"remission\" or \"complete remission\", leave blank if the record says only \"partial remission\" or \"stable\". 2009 Abstractor's Manual 260 31810 - DATE OF FIRST RECURRENCE Field Length: 8 Enter the month, day, and year of first recurrence since the patient was reported to be disease - free in Item 31800 .

Site/Lat/Morph (IF 42) Override flags are available to indicate that a record with apparently inconsistent or unlikely data has been reviewed and is in fact correct as coded. Enter a '1' in the field that describes the edit check that is to be overridden. Override flags a -d (fields 32270- 32300) are not used by KCR. Override flags e -v are described in greater detail on the following pages. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 288 32310 - Override ACSN/Class/Seq The edit, , Case , Seq Number (CoC), checks the following: If the case is the only case or the first of multiple cases diagnosed at the facility (ACoS Sequence Number = 00, 01, 60 or 61, and Class of Case = 0, 1, or 6), then the first 4 characters of the Accession Number must equal the year of the Date of First Contact . If the case is first diagnosed at autopsy (Class of Case = 5), and the case is the only case or the first of multiple cases for a patient (ACoS Sequence Number = 00, 01, 60, or 61), then the first 4 characters of the Accession Number must equal the year of the Date of Last Contact or Death AND must equal the year of the Date of First Contact . If the case is first diagnosed at autopsy (Class of Case = 5), and the case is the second or more case for a patient (ACoS Sequence Number greater than 01 or greater than 61), then the year of the Date of First Contact must equal the year of Date of Last Contact or Death. There are some exceptions to the above rules. Override Acsn/Class/Seq may be used to override the edit when the circums tances fit the following situation or one similar to it: The case may be the only or the first of multiple malignant cases for a patient (ACoS Sequence Number = 00 or 01), but there is an earlier benign case (with an earlier year of the Date o f First Contact) for which the Accession Number applies. Instructions for Coding Leave blank if the EDITS program does not generate an error message for the edit Accession Number , Class of Case , Sequence Number (CoC). Leave blank an d correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect. Code 1 if a review of all items in the error or warning message confirms that all are correct. Case and FU Data 289 32320 - Override Hosps Num -Hosp (CoC), does the following: \u00b7 If any case is one of multiple primaries and is not microscopically confirmed or positive lab test/marker study, i.e., Diagnostic Confirmation > 5 and ACoS Sequence Number > 00 (more than one primary), review is required. \u00b7 If Primary Site specifies an ill- defined or unknown primary (C76.0-C76.8, C80.9), no further checking is done. If ACoS Sequence Number is in the range of 60- 88, this edit is skipped. It is important to verify that the non- microscopically -confirmed case is indeed a separate primary from any others that may have been reported. This edit forces review of multiple primary cancers when one of the primaries is coded to a site other than ill -define d or unknown and is not microscopically confirmed or confirmed by a positive lab test/marker study. \u00b7 If this edit is failed and the suspect case is confirmed accurate as coded, and the number of primaries is correct, set the Override HospSeq/DxConf to 1. Do not set the override flag on the patient's other primary cancers. \u00b7 However, if it turns out that the non- microscopically -confirmed cancer is considered a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers, delete the non- microscopically -confir med case. Check the sequence numbers of remaining cases, correcting them if necessary. Also check for other data items on the remaining cases that may need to be changed as a result of the corrections, such as stage and treatment. Instructions for Coding \u00b7 Leave blank if the EDITS program does not generate an error message for the edit Diagnostic Confirm , Seq Num -Hosp (CoC). \u00b7 Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect. \u00b7 Code 1 if a review of all ite ms in the error or warning message confirms that all are correct 2009 Abstractor's Manual 290 32330 - Override CoC - Site/Type There are multiple versions of edits of the type, Primary Site , Morphology -Type, which check for \"usual\" ICD -O-2 or ICD -O-3 histology. The SEER version of the edit is more restrictive than the CoC edit, and thus uses a different override flag. The CoC version of the edit will accept Override CoC -Site/Type or Override Site/Type as equivalent. \u00b7 The Site/Histology Validation List (available on the SEER Web site) contains those histologies commonly found in the specified primary site. Histologies that occur only rarely or never are not be included. These edits require review of all combinations no t listed. \u00b7 Since basal and squamous cell carcinomas of non- genital skin sites are not reportable to SEER, these site/histology combinations do not appear on the SEER validation list. For the CoC version of the edit, if Primary Site is in the range C44.0- C44.9 (skin), and the ICD -O-3 histology carcinomas), no further editing is done. No ove rride is necessary for these cases in the CoC version of the edit. Review of these cases requires investigating whether the combination is biologically implausible or there are cancer registry coding conventions that would dictate different codes for the diagnosis. Review of these rare combinations often results in changes to the primary site and/or morphology, rather than a decision that the combination is correct. Instructions for Coding \u00b7 Leave blank if the EDITS program does not generate an error message for edits of the type Primary Site , Morphology -Type Check. \u00b7 Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect. \u00b7 Code 1 if a review of all items in the error or warning message confirms they are correct and coded in conformance with coding rules. Case and FU Data 291 32340 - Override Hospseq/Site Edits of the type, Seq Num --Hosp, Primary Site, Morph, differ in use of ICD -O-2 or ICD -O-3 morphology. They force review of multiple primary cancers when one of the primaries is coded to a site -morphology combination that could indicate a metastatic site rather than a primary site. If ACoS Sequence Number indicates the person has had more than one primary, then any case with one of the following site -histology combinations requires review: \u00b7 C76.0-C76.8 (Ill -defined sites) -O-3 histology < 9590. (Look for evide nce that the unknown or ill -defined primary is a secondary site from one of the patient's other cancers. For example, a clinical discharge diagnosis of \"abdominal carcinomatosis\" may be attributable to the patient's primary ovarian cystadenocarcinoma already in the registry, and should not be entered as a second primary.) \u00b7 C77.0- C77.9 (lymph nodes) and ICD not in the range 9590- 9989. (That combination is most likely a metastatic lesion. Check whether the lesion could be a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers.) \u00b7 Any site and ICD -O-2 9740 -9758.

Combinations of site and histology not represented in any AJCC schema must be coded 88. Unknown codes must be coded 99. Blanks are not permit ted. Since pediatric cancers whose sites and histologies have an AJCC scheme may be coded according to a pediatric scheme instead, Override Site/TNM -Stage Group is used to indicate pediatric cases not coded according to the AJCC manual. Pediatric stage g roups should not be recorded in the Clinical Stage Group or Pathologic Stage Group items. When neither clinical nor pathologic AJCC staging is used for pediatric cases, code all AJCC items 88. When any components of either is used to stage a pediatric case, follow the instructions for coding AJCC items and leave Override Site/TNM -Stage Group blank.

It is important to verify that the non -microscopically -confirmed case is indeed a separate primary from any others that may have been reported. If the suspect case is accurate as coded, and the number of primaries is correct, set the Override SeqNo/DxConf flag to 1 so that the case will not appear in future edits as an error. It is not necessary to set the override flag on the patient's other primary cancers. If it turns out that the non- microscopically -confirmed cancer is considered a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers, delete the non -microscopically -confirmed case. Check the sequence numbers of remaining cases, correcting them if necessary.

If the patient had a surgical procedure, most likely there was a microscopic examination of the cancer. Verify the surgery and diagnostic confirmation codes, and correct any errors. Sometimes there are valid reasons why no microscopic confirmation is achieved with the surgery, for example, the tissue removed may be inadequate for evaluation.

Case and FU Data 297 32400 - Override Site/Type (IF 25) There are multiple versions of edits of the type, Primary Site , Morphology -Type, which check for \"usual\" ICD -O-2 or ICD -O-3 histology. The SEER version of the edit is more restrictive than the CoC edit, and thus uses a different ove rride flag. The CoC version of the edit will accept Override CoC -Site/Type or Override Site/Type as equivalent. The Site/Histology Validation List (available on the SEER website) contains those histologies commonly found in the specified primary sit e. Histologies that occur only rarely or never are not be included. These edits require review of all combinations not listed. Since basal and squamous cell carcinomas of non- genital skin sites are not reportable to SEER, these site/histology combinations do not appear on the SEER validation list. For the CoC version of the edit, if Primary Site is in the range C440- C449 (skin), and the ICD -O-3 histology cell carcinomas), no further editing is done. No override is necessary for these cases in the CoC version of the edit. Review of these cases requires investigating whether the combination is biologically implausible or there are cancer registry coding conventions that would dictate different codes for the diagnosis. Review of these rare combinations often results in changes to the primary site and/or morphology, rather than a decision that the combination is correct. Instructions for Coding Leave blank if the EDITS program does not generate an error message for the edit Primary Site, Morphology -Type Check (SEER IF25) and/or the edit Primary Site, Morphology -Type ICDO3 (SEER IF25). Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect. Code 1 if review of all items in the error or warning message confirms that all are correct. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 298 32410 - Override Histology/Behavior (IF 31/SEER MORPH) I. Edits of the type, Diagnostic Confirmation, Behavior Code , differ in the use of ICD -O-2 or ICD-O-3 and check that, for in situ cases (Behavior = 2), Diagnostic Confirmation specifies microscopic confirmation (1, 2 or 4). The distinction between in situ and invasive is very important to a registry, since prognosis is so different. Since the determination that a neoplasm has not invaded surrounding tissue, i.e. is in situ, is made microscopically, cases coded in situ i n behavior should have a microscopic confirmation code. Note: Very rarely, a physician will designate a case noninvasive or in situ without microscopic evidence. If an edit of the type, Diagnostic Confirmation, Behavior Code , gives an error message or warning, check that Behavior Code and Diagnostic Confirmation have been coded correctly. Check carefully for any cytologic or histologic evidence that may have been missed in coding. II. Edits of the type, Morphology -Type/Behavior , perform the following ICD -O-2 or ICD -O-3 with behavior codes of only 0 or 1 are considered valid, since use of the behavior matrix of ICD -O-2 and ICD -O-3 allows for the elevation of the behavior of such histologies when the tumor i s in situ or malignant. This edit forces review of these rare cases to verify that they are indeed in situ or malignant. If a Morphology -Type/Behavior edit produces an error or warning message and the case is one in which the 4- digit morphology code is one that appears in ICD -O-2 or ICD -O-3 only with behavior codes of 0 or 1, verify the coding of morphology and that the behavior should be coded malignant or in situ. The registrar may need to consult a pathologist or medical advisor in problem cases. Exceptions to the above: If year of Date of Diagnosis > 2000, then a behavior code of 1 is valid for the following ICDO -2 histologies and no histolog ies are valid with a behavior 8451, 8462, 8472, and 8473. Note: The Morphology -Type/Behavior edits are complex and perform several additional types of checks. No other aspects of their checks are subject to override.

Case and FU Data 301 32430 - Override Sequence Number/Ill -defined Site (IF 22) This edit f orces review of multiple primary cancers when one of the primaries is coded to a site- morphology combination that could indicate a metastatic site rather than a primary site. GENERAL It is important to verify that the suspect case is indeed a separate pr imary from any others that may have been reported for the patient. Correction of errors may require inspection of the abstracted text, either online or as recorded on a paper abstract. Review of the original medical record may be necessary. If the suspect case is accurate as coded, and the number of primaries is correct, set the Over -ride Ill- define site flag to 1 so that the case will not be considered in error when the edit is run again. It is not necessary to set the over -ride flag on the patient's other primary cancers. If it turns out that the suspect cancer is considered a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers, delete the former case, resequence remaining cases, and correct the coding on the latter case as necessary. SPECIFIC GUIDELIN ES 1. Ill-defined sites (C76.0 - C76.8) or unknown primary (C80.9) and histology code less than 9590: Look for evidence that the unknown or ill -defined primary is a secondary site (extension or metastasis) from one of the patient's other cancers. For example, a clinical discharge diagnosis of \"r;abdominal carcinomatosis\" may be attributable to the patient's primary ovarian cystadenocarcinoma known to the registry, and should not be entered as a second primary. 2. Lymph nodes (C77.0 - C77.9) and histol ogy code not in the range 9590 -9714: Primary malignancies of lymph nodes are almost exclusively the lymphomas coded in the range 9590- 9714. A carcinoma, sarcoma, leukemia, or other diagnosis outside that range in a lymph node is most likely a metastatic (s econdary) lesion. Check whether the lymph node lesion could be a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers. If the lesion in the lymph node is considered a separate primary, try to ascertain a more appropriate primary site than lymph nodes. 3. Hematopoietic and reticuloendothelial systems (C42.0 - C42.4) and histology not in the range 9590- 9941: Primary cancers of the blood, bone marrow, spleen, etc. are almost exclusively lymphomas, leukemias, and related conditions coded in the range 9590 -9941. A carcinoma, sarcoma, or other diagnosis outside that range in one of these sites is most likely a metastatic (secondary) lesion. Check whether the lesions could be a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers. If the lesion is considered a separate primary, try to ascertain a more appropriate primary site other than those in the C42 group. 4. Other lymphoreticular neoplasms and mast cell tumors of any site (histologies 9720- 9723 and 9740- 9741): Verify that these diagnoses are coded correct ly and are indeed separate primaries from the other reported ones. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 302 Instructions for Coding Leave blank if the EDITS program does not generate an error message for this edit. Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect. Code 1 if review of all items in the error or warning message confirms that all are correct. Case and FU Data 303 32440 - Override Leukemia, Lymphoma (IF 48) Edits of the type, Diagnostic Conf irmation , Histol Type ICD -O-3 and check the following: Since lymphoma and leukemia are almost exclusively microscopic diagnoses, this edit forces review of any cases of lymphoma that have diagnostic confirmation of direct visualization or clinical, and any leukemia with a diagnostic confirmation of direct visualization. If histology is 9590- (lymphoma), then Diagnostic Confirmation cannot be 6 (direct visualization) or 8 (clinical). If histology is 9720- ICD -O-3 (leukemia and other), then Diagnostic Confirmation cannot be 6 (direct visualization). In an edit of the type, Diagnostic Confirmation, Histol Type , produces an er ror or warning message, check that the Histology and Diagnostic Confirmation are correctly coded.

Conversely, if inadequate information is available to determine a specific primary site, it is unlikely that information about a cancer being in situ is reliable. If a specific in situ diagnosis is provided, try to obtain a more specific primary site. A primary site within an orga n system can sometimes be identified based on the diagnostic procedure or treatment given or on the histologic type. If a more specific site cannot be determined, it is usually preferable to code a behavior code of 3. In the exceedingly rare situation in w hich it is certain that the behavior is in situ and no more specific -site code is applicable, set Override Site/Behavior to 1.

A case in a multi- facility database may be associated with more than one facility, and thus may have text for each affiliated facility. Case and FU Data 309 70050- 70140 - OPEN TEXT DOCUMENTATION Field Length: 3360 (x 10) In accordance with new CDC/NPCR requirements, KCR began requiring text documentation on all new cases di agnosed January 1, 2001 and after. The documentation must include explanations regarding the history and physical, diagnostic procedures, surgeries performed surgical findings and place of diagnosis. Text is needed to justify codes selected for specific data elements and to allow for the recording of information that is not coded at all. It is used by the central registry for quality control of the data and to assure that the data meets the standards of ACoS, NAACCR, NCDB, SEER, and NPCR. It also is utilized to answer questions which arise during the editing and consolidation process performed at the central registry, thus improving the accuracy and timeliness of that process as well. The best code(s) from all sources can generally be selected when the s upporting text is sufficient to help verify the decision. Through more complete documentation in the text fields, it is expected that fewer cases will need to be returned to the hospital for further review and/or clarification and that error rates in dat a abstraction will be reduced.

Palliative procedures are performed to relieve symptoms and may include surgery, radiation therapy, systemic therapy, and/or pain management therapy. Surgical procedures, radiation therapy, or systemic therapy provided to prolong the patient's life by controlling symptoms, to alleviate pain, or to make the patient comfortable should be coded as palliative care and as first course therapy if that procedure removes or modifies malignant tissue. Codes 0 No palliative care provided. Diagnosed at autopsy. 1 Surgery (which may involve a bypass procedure) to alleviate symptoms, but no attempt is made to diagnose, stage, or treat the primary tumor. 2 Radiation therapy to alleviate symptoms, but no attempt is made to diagnose, stage, or treat the primary tumor. 3 Chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or other systemic drugs to alleviate symptoms, but no attempt is made to diagnose, stage, or treat the primary tumor. 4 Patient received or was referred for pain management therapy with no other palliative care. 5 Any combination of codes 1, 2, and/or 3 without code 4. 6 Any combination of codes 1, 2, and/or 3 with code 4. 7 Palliative care was performed or referred, but no information on the type of procedure is available.

When a CoC approved facility merges with another facility or joins a network, its unique FIN may change. Archive FIN preserves the identity of the facility at the time the case was initially accessioned so that records re submitted subsequent to such a reorganization can be recognized as belonging to the same facility. Archive FIN is automatically coded by CPDMS.net. This item never changes and must be included as part of the patient record when data are submitted to t he NCDB. For facilities that have not merged, Archive FIN and FIN are the same. A case in a multi -facility database may be associated with more than one facility, and this field exists in the class history record for each affiliated facility. When a f acility creates or associates itself with a case, this field is automatically filled in with the value from Archive FIN ( item 31725 ). Class Data 327 40090 - Date Class History Completed Field Length: 8 This field records the date that the case was initially saved without errors by each facility affiliated with a case. It is automatically calculated. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 328 40100 - Date Class History Last Updated Field Length: 8 The field records the date the class history was last changed or updated. It is automatically calculated any time the class history is edited. Class Data 329 40360 - LAST MODIFICATION BY (Class) Field Length: 8 This is a calculated field which records the user name of the last individual to modify class history data. It is updated each time the record is edited. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 330 40370 - LAST MODIFICATION TIME (Class) Field Length: 19 This field automatically records the date and time that class history data was last modified. 331 Therapy Data THERAPY INFORMATION Data items 5 0040- 50400 Each type of definitive therapy (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, etc.) that the patient received should be recorded in detail in data items 50040- 50400. These items may be repeated as often as necessary in order to record every type of treatment adminis tered to the patient. If the same type of treatment is given more than once during a course, it only needs to be recorded one time -- UNLESS the procedure code or treatment agents change. Then, items 50040- 50400 would have to be repeated in order to record the differences in those item(s). For example, if a patient has both a lumpectomy and a mastectomy, you would have to complete items 50040- 50400 for each instance of surgery because the procedure code is different. See special note for radiation treatment below. Coding Surgery: The CPDMS software uses the same data fields (items 50040 -50400) to record both definitive and non- definitive therapies. Non -definitive surgical procedures include incisional biopsies, bypass surgeries, etc., and the codes for the se procedures are the same for all types of cancer. Coding non- definitive surgical procedures became required by the ACoS for approved facilities in 1996; however, it is optional for KCR. The definitive surgical procedure codes are site specific and they are contained in Appendix G . These surgery codes changed significantly in 1998 with the ACoS ROADS Manual, and again in 2003 with the FORDS Manual. Surgery codes collected prior to 1998 were converted to the 1998 ROADS definitions and are stored in data items 50240- 50290. Surgeries coded for cancers diagnosed from 1998 to 2002 are also collected in items 50240- 50290 and are defined by the ACoS ROADS Manual. Starting with cancers diagnosed in 2003, the site specif ic surgery codes are stored in data items 50100 -50120 and are defined by the ACoS FORDS Manual. Both sets of codes are included in Appendix G. Be sure to use the correct table based on the diagnosis year of the cancer being abstracted. Note on Coding Rad iation Treatment: (This is for ACoS approved hospitals and pertains to treatment given to patients diagnosed after January 1, 2003.) You should summarize the entire first course of radiation treatment on one radiation therapy segment. Code all eight new r adiation fields implemented with FORDS. If you learn of more radiation given after you have abstracted and entered this patient record, then EDIT the EXISTING radiation treatment segment instead of creating a new radiation therapy record segment. This is i mportant for NCDB submissions. They require one summary record of first course radiation treatment. If there are more in your database, only the one with the earliest start date will be sent to NCDB. If palliative radiation is also given, it must also be r ecorded in the radiation therapy fields. Each data element and the appropriate codes are further explained on the following pages. Follow -up 2009 Abstractor's Manual 332 information about subsequent therapies may be recorded in the same manner as the first course of therapy. Therapy Data 333 50040 - THERAPY TYPE Field Length: 1 Using the codes below, record the type of therapy the patient received, regardless of where it was given. THERAPY TYPES N - Non -definitive surgery S - Surgery R - Radiotherapy C - Chem otherapy H - Hormone therapy I - Immunotherapy T - Transplant or Endocrine procedures O - Other therapy Other therapy includes: experimental, alternative, complementary, and any other types of therapy not elsewhere listed. If no definitive therapy was administered to this patient, or you may leave items 50040- 50400 blank and record an appropriate code in Reason No Therapy and Date No First Therapy . 2009 Abstractor's Manual 334 50050 - COURSE OF THERAPY Field Length: 1 Enter the letter which indicates whether this therapy type was administered as part of the first course of therapy or was part of a subsequent course of therapy. F = first cou rse S = subsequent Refer to the General Coding Principals section of this manual for a discussion of the definition of first course of therapy. Therapy Data 335 50060 - DATE THERAPY STARTED Field Length: 8 Enter the month, day, and year this treatment type was initiated for this case of cancer. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 336 50070 - Therapy Facility Field Length: 10 Enter the name or code of the facility where treatment was given. These codes are optional and defined by each institution, for its own use. The codes for many health care facilities in Kentucky listed in Appendix F may be used. Therapy Data 337 50075 - THERAPY LOCAL HOSPITAL ID Field Length: 10 Select the appropriate code to indicate if this therapy was administered at your facility. Otherwise, enter '0' for No. 0 - Not administered by this facility <hosp ID> -<HOSPITAL NAME> 9 - Valid only for diagnoses before 1/1/2003 2009 Abstractor's Manual 338 50090 - Non -definitive Surgery Field Leng th: 2 When therapy type = N, you may record surgical procedures that are NOT considered treatment in this field. The codes are the same for all sites: 01 Incisional biopsy of other than primary site leaving gross residual disease Needle biopsy of other than primary site Aspiration biopsy of other than primary site 02 Incisional biopsy of primary site leaving gross residual disease Needle biopsy of primary site Aspiration biopsy of primary site (must obtain tissue to be recorded) 03 Exploratory ONLY (no biopsy) 04 Bypass surgery (no biopsy); - ostomy ONLY (no biopsy) 05 Exploratory ONLY and incisional or needle biopsy of primary site or other sites 06 Bypass surgery and incisional or needle biopsy of primary site or other sites - ostomy ONLY and incisional or needle biopsy of primary site or other sites 07 Non -definitive surgery, NOS Record the type of procedure performed as part of the initial diagnosis and workup, whether this is done at your institution or another facility. If both an incisional biopsy of the primary site and an incisional biopsy of a metastatic site are done, use code 02 (Incisional biopsy of primary site). For lymphomas of lymph node primary site (C77._), you may code the excision of a lymph node in this item (code 02) if it is for diagnostic and/or staging purposes. The surgical removal of lymph nodes for eradication of the lymphoma would be coded in Surgical Procedure of Primary Site . Do not code surgical procedures which aspirate, biopsy, or remove regional lymph nodes in an effort to diagnose and/or stage disease in this data item. Use the data item Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery to code these procedures. Do not code brushings, washings, cell aspiration, and hematologic findings (peripheral blood smears). These are not considered surgical procedures. Do not code excisional biopsies with clear or microscopic margins in this data item. Use the data item Surgical Procedure of Primary Site . Do not code pallia tive surgical procedures in this data item. Use the data item Palliative Procedure . Do not record biopsies that are negative for cancer. Therapy Data 339 50100 - SURGICAL PROCEDURE OF PRIMARY SITE -FORDS Field Length: 2 Record the surgical procedure(s) performed to the primary site. Site-specific codes for this data item are found in Appendix G -Surgery Codes -FORDS. For codes 00 through 79, the response positions are hierarchical. Last -listed responses take precedence over responses written above. Code 98 takes preceden ce over code 00. Use codes 80 and 90 only if more precise information about the surgery is unavailable. Biopsies that remove all of the tumor and/or leave only microscopic margins are to be coded in this item, even if documented as \"r;incis ional biopsy.\" Surgery to remove regional tissue or organs is coded in this item only if the tissue/organs are removed in continuity with the primary site, except where noted in Appendix G - Surgery Codes -FORDS. If a previous surgical procedure to remove a portion of the primary site is followed by surgery to remove the remainder of the primary site, then code the total or final results. For all hematopoietic, reticuloe ndothelial, immunoproliferative, and myeloproliferative diseases, this code is 98. Any surgical procedures performed for these diagnoses are recorded in the data item Surgical Procedure Other Site- FORD S. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 340 50110 - SCOPE OF REGIONAL LYMPH NODE SURGERY- FORDS Field Length: 1 Record the removal, biopsy, or aspiration of regional lymph node(s) at the time of surgery of the primary site or during a separate surgical event. The scope of regional lymph node surgery is collected for each surgical event even if surgery of the primary site was not performed. Record surgical procedures which aspirate, biopsy, or remove regional lymph nodes in an effort to diagnose or stage disease in this data item. Codes 0- 7 are hierarchical. If only one procedure can be recorded, code the procedure that is numerically higher. For primaries of the meninges, brain, spinal cord, cranial nerves, and other parts of the central nervous system (C70.0- C70.9, C71.0- node primary site (C77.0- C77.9), code 9. For an unknown or ill Do not code distant lymph nodes removed during surgery to the primary site for this data item. Distant nodes are coded in the data field Surgical Procedure/Other Site . Refer to the current AJCC Cancer Staging Manual for site -specific identification of regional lymph nodes. If the operative report lists a lymph node dissection, but no nodes were found by the pathologist, code this field 0 (no lymph nodes removed). If the patient has two primaries with common regional lymph nodes, code the removal of regional nodes for both primaries. Code Label Definition 0 None No regional lymph node surgery. No lymph nodes found in the pathologic specimen. Diagnosed at autopsy 1 Biopsy or aspiration of Biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph node(s) regional lymph node, NOS regardless of the extent of involvement of disease. 2 Sentinel lymph node Biopsy of the first lymph node or nodes that drain biopsy a defined area of tissue within the body. Sentinel node(s) are identified by the injection of a dye or radio label at the site of the primary tumor. 3 Number of regional nodes Sampling or dissection of regional lymph node(s) removed unknown or and the number of nodes removed is unknown or Therapy Data 341 not stated; regional lymph not stated. The procedure is not specified as nodes removed, NOS sentinel nodes node biopsy. 4 1- 3 regional lymph nodes Sampling or dissection of regi onal lymph node(s) removed with fewer than four lymph nodes found in the specimen.

Assign the highest numbered code that describes the surgical resection of distant lymph node(s) and/or regional/distant tissue or organs. Incidental removal of tissue or organs is not a \"r;Surgical Procedure/Other Site.\" Code 1 if any surgery is performed to treat tumors of unknown or ill -defined primary sites (C76.0- C76.8, surgical procedure of nonprimary site was performed. 1 Nonprimary surgical resection to other site(s), unknown if whether the site(s) is reg ional or distant. 2 Nonprimary surgical procedure to other regional sites 3 Nonprimary surgical procedure to distant lymph node(s) 4 Nonprimary surgical procedure to distant site 5 Any combination of surgical procedures 2, 3, or 4. 9 Unknown; death certificate only Therapy Data 343 50130 - SURGICAL MARGINS Field Length: 1 This field describes the status of the surgical margins after resection of the primary tumor. The codes for surgical margins are not site specific and were converted for cancers diagnosed before 2003. Microscopic involvement cannot be seen by the naked eye. The pathology report usually documents microscopic involvement in the final diagnosis or the microsc opic portion of the report. Macroscopic involvement is gross tumor which is visible to the naked eye. It may be documented in the operative report or in the gross portion of the pathology report. The code is hierarchical; if two codes describe the marg in status, use the numerically higher code. Code the margin status for each individual surgical event. If no surgery of the primary site was performed, code 8. For lymphomas (M -9590- 9596, 9650- 9719, node primary site (C77.0- C77.9), code 9. For an unknown or ill C76.8, Code Label Definition 0 No residual tumor All margins are grossly and microscopically negative 1 Residual tumor, NOS Involvement is indicated, but not otherwise specified. 2 Microscopic residual tumor Cannot be seen by the naked eye. 3 Macroscopic residual tumor Gross tumor of the primary site which is visible to the naked eye. 7 Margins not evaluable Cannot be assessed (indeterminate). 8 No primary site surgery No surgical procedure of the primary site. Diagnosed at autopsy. 9 Unknown or not applicable Unknown whether a surgical procedure to the primary site was performed; DCO; for lymphomas with a lymph node primary site; an unknown or ill -defined primary; or for hematopoietic diseases. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 344 50140 - RADIATION THERAPY CODE Field Length: 1 Code the type of radiation therapy that the patient received. This field will be calculated for ACoS approved facilities from items 50320 and 50340 . Non- approved facilities MUST enter the radiation therapy code manually. For all sites, the codes are: 1 - Beam radiation 2 - Radioactive implants 3 - Radioisotopes 4 - Combinations of bea m radiation with radioactive implants or radioisotopes 5 - Radiation therapy, NOS Code 1 (beam radiation) includes treatment given with X ray, cobalt, linear accelerator, neutron beam, and betatron, as well as spray radiation and stereotactic radiosurger y, such as gamma knife and proton beam, regardless of the source of the radiation. Code 2 (radioactive implants) includes brachytherapy, radioembolization, interstitial implants, molds, seeds, needles, or intracavity applicators of radioactive materials, such as cesium, radium, radon, and radioactive gold. Code 3 (radioisotopes) includes internal use of radioactive isotopes, such as iodine -131 or phosphorus -32, given orally or intracavitarily, or by intravenous injection. If the method or source is not given, code 5 (radiation therapy, NOS). Therapy Data 345 50150- 50170 - Radiation Sites Field Length: 2 (x3) When the treatment type is R, record a two digit code for up to three sites to which radiotherapy was directed. Use t he General Sites Dictionary in Appendix E . When more than three sites are indicated, enter the code for the three most definitive sites, coding the primary site of the cancer in the first set of boxes. Precede any single digit codes with a zero. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 346 50180 - Total Number of Rads Field Length: 5 Enter the total dosage of radiation, directed to the site specified in items 50150- 50170 , that was received by the patient for this particular type and course of radiation therapy. Therapy Data 347 50190 - CHEMOTHERAPY CODE Field Length: 1 Code the t ype of chemotherapy that the patient received. For all sites, the codes are: 1- Chemotherapy, NOS 2 - Chemotherapy, single agent 3 - Chemotherapy, multiple agents (combination regimens) Record any chemical that is administered to treat cancer tissue that is not considered to achieve its effect through a change in the hormonal balance. Only the agent is coded, not the method of drug administration (i.e., chemoembolization). For your inform ation, the following chemotherapy group classifications are listed below. GROUP SUBGROUP(S) EXAMPLES Alkylating agents Abstractor's Manual 348 One planned course of chemotherapy may be given in several segments. These segments are recorded as one course. If the patient has an adverse reaction, the physician may change one of the drugs in a combination regimen. If the r eplacement drug belongs to the same group as the original drug, there is no change in the regimen. If the replacement drug is in a different group than the original drug, code the new regimen as subsequent therapy. Two or more single agents given at separate times during the first course of cancer -directed therapy are considered a combination regimen and coded 3 (chemotherapy, multiple agents). If an agent in a combination regimen is a hormone (such as Prednisone in CHOP), code '3' here and record the hor monal agent again, under Hormone therapy. Do not record Prednisone as hormonal when it is administered for other reasons, such as: - A patient has advanced lung cancer with multiple metastases to the brain. The physician orders Decadron to redu ce the edema in the brain and relieve the neurological symptons. Decadron is not coded as hormone therapy. - A patient with advanced disease is given Prednisone to stimulate the appetite and improve nutritional status. Do not code the Prednisone as hormone therapy. When chemotherapeutic agents are used as radiosensitizers or radioprotectants, they are given at a much lower dosage and do not affect the cancer. Radiosensitizers and radioprotectants are classified as ancillary drugs. Do not code as chemotherapy. Effective with diagnoses in 2005 and later, use the SEER Rx program for a list of all cancer therapeutic agents (available from web site: www.seer.cancer.gov/tools/seerrx/.) For pre -2005 cases, refer to Appendix H and/or the SEER Program Self -Instructional Manual for Tumor Registrars, Book 8, Antineoplastic Drugs Second Edition . Therapy Data 349 50200 - HORMONE THERAPY Field Length: 1 Record '1' if hormone treatment agents were administered as first course treatment at this or any other facilities. Record prednisone as hormonal therapy when administered in combination with chemotherapy, such as MOPP not code prednisone as hormone therapy when it is administered for reasons other than chemotherapeutic treatment. Some types of cancers ar e slowed or suppressed by hormones . These cancers are treated by administering hormones. Example 1: Endometrial cancer may be treated with progesterone. Code all administration of progesterone to patients with endometrial cancer in this field. Even if the progesterone is given for menopausal symptoms, it has an effect on the growth or recurrence of endometrial cancer. Example 2: Follicular and papillary cell cancers of the thyroid are often treated with thyroid hormone to suppress serum thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH). If a patient with follicular 8335, 8340, or 8346) is given a thyroid hormone, code the treatment in this field. Tumor involvement or treatment may destroy hormone -producing tissue. Hormone replacement therapy will be given if the hormone is necessary to maintain normal metabolism and body function. Do not code hormone replacement therapy as part of first course therapy, except for thyroid replacement therapy, as descri bed above. Use the SEER Rx program (available from web site: www.seer.cancer.gov/tools/seerrx/) to identify hormonal agents. For pre -2005 diagnoses, refer to Appendix H and to the Self - Instructional Manual for Tumor Registrars: Book 8 - Antineoplastic Drugs , Third Edition. Code surgery or radiation given for hormonal effect under Transplant/Endocrine Procedures ( Item # 50220 ). 2009 Abstractor's IMMUNOTHERAPY Field Length: 1 Record '1' if immunotherapy was administered as first course treatment at this or any other facilities. Immunotherapy consists of biological or chemical agents that alter the immune system or change the host's response to tumor cells. Types of immunotherapy Cancer Vaccines: Cancer vaccines are still in the experimental phase and are not coded in this data item. They may be coded in the field Other Therapy. Currently clinical trials use cancer vaccines for brain, breast, colon, kidney, lung, melanoma and ovary. Interferons: Interferons belong to a group of proteins called cytokines. They are produced naturally by the white blood cells in the body. Interferon- alpha is able to slow tumor growth directly as well as activate the immune system. It is used for a number of cancers including multiple myeloma, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), hairy cell leukemia, and malignant melanoma. Interleukins (IL-2) are often used to treat kidney cancer and melanoma. Monoclonal Antibodies: Prior to 2005, monoclonal antibodies were coded as immunotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies are produced in a laboratory. The artificial antibodies are injected into the patient to seek out and disrupt cancer cell activities and to enhance the immune response against the cancer. For example, Rituximab (Ritu xan) may be used for non -Hodgkin lymphoma, and trastuzumab (Herceptin) may be used for certain breast cancers. With the introduction of SEER Rx in 2005 for coding systemic therapy, monoclonal antibodies are coded as chemotherapy if they act as cytostatic agents (such as Rituxan and Herceptin) or as radioisotopes if they deliver cytotoxic radioisotopes to the cells (such as Bexxar and Zevalin). Effective with diagnoses in 2005 and later, use the SEER Rx program (available from web site: www.seer.cancer.g ov/tools/seerrx/.) to identify immunotherapeutic agents. For pre -2005 cases, refer to Appendix H and to the Self -Instructional Manual for Tumor Registrars: Book 8 - Antineoplastic Drugs , Third Edition. Therapy Data 351 50220 - HEMATOLOGIC TRANSPLANT AND ENDOCRINE PROCEDURES Field Length: 2 Record any systemic therapeutic procedures administered as part of the first course of treatment at this and all other fa cilities. These include bone marrow transplants, stem cell harvests, surgical and/or radiation endocrine therapy. Instructions for Coding Bone marrow transplants should be coded as either autologous (bone marrow originally taken from the patient) or allogeneic (bone marrow donated by a person other than the patient). For cases in which the bone marrow transplant was syngeneic (transplanted marrow from an identical twin), the item is coded as allogeneic. Stem cell harvests i nvolve the collection of immature blood cells from the patient and the reintroduction by transfusion of the harvested cells following chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Endocrine irradiation and/or endocrine surgery are procedures which suppress the naturally occurring hormonal activity of the patient and thus alter or effect the long- term control of the cancer's growth. These procedures must be bilateral to qualify as endocrine surgery or endocrine radiation. If only one gland is intact at the start of treatment, surgery and/or radiation to that remaining gland qualifies as endocrine surgery or endocrine radiation. Code Definition 10 A bone marrow transplant procedure was administered, but the type was not specified. 11 Bone marrow transplant - autologous. 12 Bone marrow transplant - allogeneic. 20 Stem cell harvest (and infusion). 30 Endocrine surgery and/or endocrine radiation therapy. 40 Combination of endocrine surgery and/or radi ation with a transplant procedure. (Combination of codes 30 and 10, 11, 12, or 20.) 2009 Abstractor's Manual 352 50230 - OTHER THERAPY CODE Field Length: 1 These codes are available for any 'other' treatment received by the patient -- othe r than surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, transplants or endocrine procedures. Code 0 indicates nonsurgical types of non- definitive treatment. These are optional and do not have to be recorded. Ancillary drugs such as allopurinol, growth stimulating factors, Neupogen, and Epogen are examples of non- definitive therapy. Code Label Definition 0 Non -cancer - OPTIONAL CODE - may be used to record ancillary directed treatment drugs, supportive care, stent placement, etc. 1 Other treatment Cancer treatment that cannot be appropriately assigned to specified treatment data items (surgery, radiation, systemic). Use this code for treat ment unique to hematopoietic diseases (see Notes below), or for tumor embolization which does not involve a chemotherapy or radiotherapy agent (i.e., when alcohol is used as the embolizing agent in head and neck cancers). 2 Other - Experimental This code is not defined. It may be used to record participation in institution -based clinical trials. Gene therapy is coded 2. 3 Other - Double Blind A patient is involved in a double -blind clinical trial. Code the treatment actually administered when the double -blind trial code is broken. 5 Antibiotics Used to treat MALT lymphoma 6 Other - Unproven Unconventional therapies; alternative and complementary therapies (see below). Treatment for reportable hematopoietic diseases can be supportive care, observation, or any treatment that does not meet the usual definition in which treatment \"modifies, controls, removes, or destroys proliferating cancer tissue.\" Such tre atments include phlebotomy, transfusions, and aspirin (see Notes below), and should be coded 1. Notes for Hematopoietic diseases: The hematopoietic diseases for which transfusions may be coded as other therapy are comprised of the for leukemias, lymphomas, or other hematopoietic histologies. Phlebotomy may be called blood removal, blood letting, or venisection. Transfusions may include whole blood, RBCs, platelets, plateletpheresis, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), plasmapheresis, and cryoprecipitate. Therapy Data 353 Aspirin (also known as ASA, acetylsalicylic acid, or by a brand name) is used as a treatment for essenti al thrombocythemia. Record ONLY aspirin therapy to thin the blood for symptomatic control of thrombocythemia. To determine whether aspirin is administered for pain, cardiovascular protection, or thinning of platelets in the blood, use the following general guideline: -Pain control is approximately 325 -1000 mg every 3- 4 hours. -Cardiovascular protection starts at about 160 mg/day. -Aspirin treatment for essential thrombocythemia is low dose, approximately 70- 100 mg/day. Use code 3 - Double blind for clinical trial before the code is broken. After the code is broken, review and re- code therapy as needed, according to the treatment actually administered. Use code 6 - Unproven therapy - for unconventional methods whether they are given alone or in combination with other cancer directed treatments. Unconventional treatment agents are: code 6 - Unproven therapy - for alternative an d complementary therapies ONLY if they are NOT given in combination with other cancer directed treatments.

Collection of this data item was discontinued as of 1/1/2003 with FORDS implementation. \"Surgical Approach\" describes the method used to approach the organ of origin and/or primary tumor. Code the approach for surgical treatments of the primary site only. If no definitive surgical procedure at the primary site was done (\" Surgery of Primary Site\" is coded 00), \"Surgical Approach\" mus t be coded 0. \"Endoscopy, image guided\" is a generic term for guidance provided by any imaging technique include, but not limited to, CT scans, MRI scans, ultrasound, or radiographic imaging. \"Open\" is a generic term describing all non -scope approaches . Procedures for which \"Surgical Approach\" would be coded open include, but are not limited to, mastectomy; excision of a melanoma of the skin; glossectomy. \"Open, assisted by endoscopy\" means that the scope is being used (present in the body) at the same time the primary tumor is resected. DO NOT CODE a procedure as assisted by endoscopy when the scope is used and removed prior to the resection or when it is inserted and used after the resection of the primary tumor. Example: Patient with lung cancer is taken to the surgical suite. A bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy are done to evaluate whether the lesion is resectable. The scopes are removed before the surgeon performs a wedge resection. Code \"Surgical Approach\" open, NOT assisted by endoscopy. The codes for surgical approach when Therapy type = S are site specific and they are contained in Appendix G Surgical Codes -ROADS. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 356 50250 - SURGERY AT PRIMARY SITE (ROADS) Field Length: 2 When therapy type = S, the Surgery at Primary Site code indicates a definitive surgical treatment for this cancer. Enter the two digit code to indicate the specific surgical procedure perform ed at the primary cancer site. These codes are listed in Appendix G - Surgery Codes - ROADS. They are site specific codes, as taken from the ACoS Registry Operations and Data Standards Manual, revised for 1998. This data item applies only to cancers diagnosed before 2003. (Surgeries performed on patients diagnosed after 1/1/2003 are recorded in data item 50100 .) Use the following guidelines to complete this field: Only record surgeries of the primary site. Surgery to remove regional tissue or organs is coded in this field only if the tissue/organs are removed with the primary site as part of a specified code definition or in an en bloc resection. An en bloc r esection is the removal of organs in one piece at one time. Example: When a patient has a modified radical mastectomy, since the breast and axillary contents are removed in one piece (en bloc), surgery of primary site is coded as a modified radical mastectomy (50) even if the pathology finds no nodes in the specimen. The range of codes from 10- 79 are hierarchical and supersede codes '80', '90', and '99'. If more than one code describes the procedure, use the numerically higher code. If surgery was previously done, code the total result of that surgery with the current surgery. Biopsies that remove all gross tumor or leave only microscopic margins should be coded as surgery to the primary site. If there was no surgical procedure at the primary sit e, code 00. Therapy Data 357 50260 - SCOPE OF REGIONAL LYMPH NODE SURGERY (ROADS) Field Length: 1 This data field applies only to cancers diagnosed before 2003. Collection of this data item was discontinued as of 1/1/2003 with FORDS implementation. For the majority of sites, \"Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery\" defines the removal of regional lymph node(s). This refers to the farthest regional node removed regardless of involvement with disease. There is no minimum number of nodes that must be removed. If at least one regional lymph node was removed, the code for this field must be in the range of 1 -5. If a regional lymph node was aspirated or biopsied, ente r code '1'. For head and neck sites, this field describes neck dissections. Codes 2- 5 indicate only that a neck dissection procedure was done; they do not imply that nodes were found during the pathologic examination of the surgical specimen. Code the ne ck dissection even if no nodes were found in the specimen. These codes are site specific and they are contained in Appendix G - Surgery Codes - ROADS. The codes are hierarchical; if more than one applies, record the highest code (except 9). A list identifies the regional lymph nodes for each site. Any other nodes are distant; code their removal in the data field \" Surgery of Other Regional Site(s), Distant Site(s) or Distant Lymph Node(s) \". For unknown primaries , leukemias, lymphomas (except lymphomas of the spleen), hematopoietic diseases, and brain primaries code '9' in this field. If no regional lymph nodes were removed, code 0. Nodes which are considere d regional are those defined in the AJCC Manual for Staging of Cancer in each site specific chapter. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 358 50270 - NUMBER OF REGIONAL LYMPH NODES REMOVED (ROADS ) Field Length: 2 This data field applies only to cancers diagnosed before 2003. Collection of this data item was discontinued as of 1/1/2003 with FORDS implementation. Record the number of regional lymph nodes microscopically examined in the pathology report DURING THIS SURGICAL PROCEDURE ONLY. DO NOT add numbers of nodes removed at different surgical events. If no regional lymph nodes are identified in the pathology report, code 00 even if the surgical procedure includes a lymph node dissection (i.e ., modified radical mastectomy) or even if the operative report documents removal of nodes. Because this field is not cumulative and not affected by timing, it does not necessarily replace or duplicate the field \"Regional Lymph Node Examined.\" Use the Surgical Codes in Appendix G to identify the regional lymph nodes for each site. Codes: 00 No regional lymph nodes removed 01 One regional lymph node removed 02 Two regional lymph nodes removed .. 90 Ninety or more regional lymph nodes removed 95 No regional lymph node(s) removed but aspiration of regional lymph node(s) was performed. 96 Regional lymph node removal documented as a sampling and number of lymph nodes unknown/not stated 97 Regional lymph node removal documented as dissection and number of lymph nodes unknown/not stated 98 Regional lymph nodes surgically removed but number of lymph nodes unknown/not stated and not documented as sampling or di ssection. 99 Unknown; not stated; death certificate ONLY Use code 95 for a lymph node aspiration when the cytology or histology is positive for malignant cells. Use code 99 if information about regional lymph nodes is unknown, or if the field is not applicable for that site or histology, i.e., unknown primaries (C80.9). Therapy Data 359 50280 - SURGERY OF OTHER REGIONAL SITES(S), DISTANT SITE(S) OR DISTANT LYMPH NODE(S) -ROADS Field Length: 1 This data field applies only to cancers diagnosed before 2003. Collection of this data item was discontinued as of 1/1/2003 with FORDS implementation. \"Surgery of Other Regional Site(s), Distant Site(s) or Distant Lymph Node(s)\" describes the removal of tissues(s) or organ(s) other than the primary tumor or organ of origin. This field is for all procedures that do not meet the definitions of Surgery of Primary Site or Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery . Example: A patient has an excisional biopsy of a hard palate lesion is removed from the floor of the mouth and a resection of a metastatic lung nodule duri ng the same surgical event. Code the resection of the lung nodule as 6 (distant site). Code the removal of non -primary tissue which was removed because the surgeon suspected it was involved with malignancy even if the pathology is negative. DO NOT CODE the incidental removal of tissue. Incidental is defined as tissue removed for reasons other than the malignancy. For example: During a colon resection, the surgeon noted that the patient had cholelithiasis and removed the gall bladder. Do not code removal of the gall bladder. These codes are site specific and are contained in Appendix G , Surgical Codes -ROADS. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 360 50290 - RECONSTRUCTION /RESTORATION - ROADS Field Length: 1 This data field applies only to cancers diagnosed for 2003. Collection of this data item was discontinued as of 1/1/2003 with FORDS implementation. Only breast reconstruction continues to be recorded and this is captured in the Surgery at Primary Site -FORDS code. \"Reconstruction/Restoration\" is a surgical procedure that improves the shape and appearance or function of body structures that are missing, defective, damaged, or misshapen by cancer or cancer -directed ther apies. It must be a restoration of primary site or organ. \"Reconstruction/Restoration - First Course\" is limited to procedures started during the first course of therapy. Some reconstructive/restorative procedures involve several surgical events. Code as \"Reconstructive/Restoration - First Course\" if the first event occurred during the first course of treatment. Each site- specific surgery code scheme in Appendix G - Surgery Codes -ROADS has either a list of reco nstructive/restorative procedures or codes that define specific procedures. Code only those procedures listed under each site. Reconstructive/restorative procedures may be performed after first course of therapy is complete. Code these procedures in this field with therapy course is \"S\" for subsequent therapy. Therapy Data 361 50300 - Location of Radiation Treatment Field Length: 1 Description Identifies the location of the facility where radiation therapy was administered during the first course of treatment It is an optional field and it is only required for data entry to ACoS flagged hospitals. Rationale This data item provides information useful to understanding the referral patterns for radiation therapy services and for assessing the quality and outcome of radiation therapy by delivery site. Instructions for Coding Code Definition 1 All radiation therapy was administered at the reporting facility. Diagnosed at autopsy. 2 Regional treatment was administered at the reporting facility; a boost dose was administered elsewhere. 3 Regional treatment was administered elsewhere; a boost dose was administered at the reporting facility. 4 All radiation therapy was administered elsewhere. 8 Radiation therapy was administered, but the pattern does not fit the above categories. 9 Radiation therapy was administered, but th e location of the treatment facility is unknown or not stated in patient record; it is unknown whether radiation therapy was administered. Examples: Code Reason 2 A patient received radiation therapy to the entire head and neck region at the reporting facility and is then referred to another facility for a high -dose-rate (HDR) intracavitary boost. 3 A patient was diagnosed with breast cancer at another facility and received surgery and regional radiation therapy at that facility befor e being referred to the reporting facility for boost dose therapy. 8 Regional treatment was initiated at another facility and midway through treatment the patient was transferred to the reporting facility to complete the treatment regime. 9 Patient is known to have received radiation therapy, but records do not define the facility or facility(s) where the treatment was administered. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 362 50310 - Radiation Treatment Volume Field Length: 2 Description Identifies the volume or anatomic target of the most clinically significant regional radiation therapy delivered to the patient during the first course of treatment. It is an optional field and it is only required for data entry to ACoS flagged hospitals. Rationale This data item provides information describing the anatomical structures targeted by the regional radiation therapy and can be used to determine whether the site of the primary disease was treated with radiation or if other regional or distant sites were targeted. This information is useful in evaluating the patterns of care within a facility (local analysis of physician practices) and on a regional or national basis. Instructions for Coding Radiation treatment volume will typicall y be found in the radiation oncologist's summary letter for the first course of treatment. Determination of the exact treatment volume may require assistance from the radiation oncologist for consistent coding. Code Label Definition 01 Eye/orbit The radiation therapy target volume is limited to the eye and/or orbit. 02 Pituitary The target volume is restricted to the pituitary gland and all adjacent volumes are irradiated incidentally. 03 Brain (NOS) Treatment is directed at tumors lying within the substance of the brain, or its meninges. 04 Brain (limited) The treatment volume encompasses less than the total brain, or less than all of meninges. 05 Head and Neck (NOS) The treatment volume is directed at a primary tumor o the oropharyngeal complex, usually encompassing regional lymph nodes. 06 He ad and Neck (limited) Limited volume treatment of a head and neck primary with the exception of glottis (code 8), sinuses (code 9), or parotid (code 10). 07 Glottis Treatment is limited to a volume in the immediate neighborhood of the vocal cords. 08 Sinuses The primary target is one or both of the maxillary sinuses or the ethmoidal frontal sinuses.

This code is used exclusively for patients with Hodgkin's or non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. 23 Lower extended field The target zon e includes lymph nodes below the diaphragm along th paraaortic chain. It may include extension to one side of the pelvis. This code includes the 'hockey stick' field utilized to treat seminomas. 24 Spine The pr imary target relates to the bones of the spine, including the sacrum. Spinal cord malignancies should be coded 40 (Spinal cord). 25 Skull Treatment is directed at the bones of the skull. Any brain irradiation is a secondary consequence. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 364 26 Ribs Treatment is directed toward metastatic disease in one or more ribs. Fields may be tangential or direct. 27 Hip The target i ncludes the proximal femur for metastatic disease. In many cases there may be acetabular disease as well. 28 Pelvic bones The target includes structures of the bones of the pelvis other than the hip or sacrum. 29 P elvis (NOS) Irradiation is directed at soft tissues within the pelvic region and codes 34- 36 do not apply. 30 Skin The primary malignancy originates in the skin and the skin is the p rimary target. So-called skin metastasis are usually subcutaneous and should be coded 31 (soft tissue). 31 Soft tissue All treatment of primary or metastatic soft tissue malignancies not fitting other categories. 32 Hemibody A single treatment volume encompassing either all structures above the diaphragm, or all structures below the diaphragm. This is almost always administered for palliation of widespread bone metastasis in pa tients with prostate or breast cancer. 33 Whole body Entire body included in a single treatment. 34 Bladder and pelvis The primary malignancy originated in the bladder, all or most of the pelvis is treated as prat of the plan, typically with a boost to the bladder. 35 Prostate and pelvis The primary malignancy originated in the prostate, all or most of the pelvis is treated as part of the plan, typically with a boost to t he prostate. 36 Uterus and cervix Treatment is confined to the uterus and cervix or vaginal cuff, usually by intracavitary or interstitial technique. If entire pelvis is included in a portion of the treatment, then code 29 (Pelvis, NOS). 37 Shoulder Treatment is directed to the proximal humerus, scapula, clavicle, or other components of the shoulder complex. This is usually administered for control of symptoms for metastasis. 38 Ext remity bone, NOS Bones of the arms or legs. This excludes the proximal femur, code 27 (Hip). This excludes the proximal humerus, code 37 (Shoulder). 39 Inverted Y Treatment has been given to a field that encompasses the paraaortic and bilateral inguinal or inguinofemoral lymph nodes in a single port. 40 Spinal Cord Treatment is directed at the spinal cord or its meninges. 41 Prostate Treatment is directed at the prostate with or without the seminal vesicles, without regional lymph node treatment. Therapy Data 365 50 Thyroid Treatment is directed at the thyroid gland. 60 Lymph node region, NOS The target is a group of lymph nodes not listed above. Examples include isolated treatment of a cervical, supraclavicular, or inguinofemoral region. 98 Other Radiation therapy administered, treatment volume other than those previously categorized. 99 Unknown Radiation therapy administered, treatment volume unknown or not stated in patient record; it is unknown if radiation therapy was administered. Examples : Code Reason 01 Lymphoma of the orbit treated with 4 cm x 4 cm portals. 02 Pituitary adenomas receiving small opposed field or rotational treatment. 03 The entire brain is treated for metastatic disease. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 366 50320 - Regional Treatment Modality Field Length: 2 Description Records the dominant modality of radiation therapy used to deliver the most clinically significant regional dose to the primary volume of interest during the first course of t reatment. It is an optional field and it is only required for data entry to ACoS flagged hospitals. Rationale Radiation treatment is frequently delivered in two or more phases which can be summarized as \"regional\" and \"boost\" treatments. To evaluate patt erns of radiation oncology care, it is necessary to know which radiation resources were employed in the delivery of therapy. For outcomes analysis, the modalities used for each of these phases can be very important. Instructions for Coding Radiation treatment modality will typically be found in the radiation oncologist's summary letter for the first course of treatment. Segregation of treatment components into regional and boost and determination of the respective treatment modality may require assistance from the radiation oncologist to ensure consistent coding. In the event multiple radiation therapy modalities were employed in the treatment of the patient, record only the dominant modality. Note that in some circumstances the boost treatment may precede the regional treatment. For purposes of this data item, photons and x -rays are equivalent. Code Label Definition 20 External beam, NOS The treatment is known to be by external beam, but there is insufficient information to determine the specific modality. 21 Orthovoltage External beam therapy administered using equipment with a maximum energy of less than one (1) million volts (MV). Orthovoltage energies are typically expressed in units of kilovolts (kV). 22 Cobalt -60, Cesium -137 External beam therapy using a machine containing either a Cobalt -60 or Cesium -137 source. Intracavitary use of these sources is coded either 50 or 51. 23 Photons (2- 5 MV) External beam therapy using a photon producing machine with a beam energy in the range of 2 -5 MV. 24 Photons (6- 10 MV) E xternal beam therapy using a photon producing machine with a beam energy in the range of 6 -10 MV. 25 Photons (11- 19 MV) External beam therapy using a photon producing machine with a beam energy in the range of 11 -19 MV. 26 Phot ons (>19 MV) External beam therapy using a photon producing machine with a beam energy of more than 19 MV.

The unit of measure is centigray (cGy). It is an optional field and it is only required for data entry to ACoS flagged hospitals. Rationale To evaluate patterns of radiation oncology care, it is necessary to capture information describing the prescribed regional radiation dose. Outcomes are strongly related to the dose delivered. Instructions for Coding The International Council for Radiation Protection (ICRP) recommends recording doses at the axis point where applicable (opposed fields, four field box, wedged pair, and so on). For maximum consistency in this data item, the ICRP recommendations should be followed whenever possible. Where there is no clear axis point, record the dose as indicated in the summary chart. Determining the exact dose may be highly subjective and require assistance from the rad iation oncologist for consistent coding. Regional dose will typically be found in the radiation oncologist's summary letter for the first course of treatment. Determination of the total dose of regional therapy may require assistance from t he radiation oncologist for consistent coding. Do not include the boost dose, if one was administered. Code 88888 when brachytherapy or radioisotopes - codes 50- 62 for Regional Treatment Modality - were administered to the p atient. Note that dose is still occasionally specified in \"rads.\" One rad is equivalent to one centigray (cGy). Code Definition (fill spaces) Record the actual regional dose delivered. 88888 Not applicabl e, brachytherapy or radioisotopes administered to the patient. 99999 Regional radiation therapy was administered, but the dose is unknown; it is unknown whether radiation therapy was administered. Therapy Data 369 50340 - Boost Treatment Modality Field Length: 2 Description Records the dominant modality of radiation therapy used to deliver he most clinically significant boost dose to the primary volume of interest during the first course of treatment. This is accomplished with external beam fields of reduced size (relative to the regional treatment fields), implants, stereotactic radiosurgery, conformal therapy, or IMRT. External beam boosts may consist of two or more successive phases with progressively smaller fields generally coded as a single entity. It is an optional field and it is only required for data entry to ACoS flagged hospitals. Rationale Radiation treatment is frequently delivered in two or more phases which can be summarized as \"regional\" and \"boost\" treatments. To evaluate patterns of radiation oncology care, it is necessary to know which radiation resources were employed in the delivery of therapy.

The unit of measure is centiGray (cGy). It is an optional field and it is only required for data entry to ACoS flagged hospitals. Rationale To evaluate patterns of radiation oncology care, it is necessa ry to capture information describing the prescribed boost radiation dose. Outcomes are strongly related to the dose delivered. Instructions for Coding The International Council for Radiation (ICRP) recommends recording doses at the axis point where applicable (opposed fields, four field box, wedged pair, and so on). For maximum consistency in this data item, the ICRP recommendations should be followed whenever possible. Where there is no clear axis point, record the dose as indicated in the summary chart. Consult the radiation oncologist for the exact dose, if necessary. Radiation boost treatment will typically be found in the radiation oncologist's summary letter for the first course of treatment. Determination of the additional boost dose of radiation therapy may require assistance from the radiation oncologist for consistent coding. Do not include the regional dose. In general, the boost dose will be calculated as the difference between the maximum prescrib ed dose and the regional dose. Many patients will not have a boost. Code 88888 when brachytherapy or radioisotopes - codes 50- 62 for Boost Treatment Modality - were administered to the patient. Note that dose is still occasionally specified in \"rads\" One rad is equivalent to one centiGray (cGy). Code Definition (fill spaces) Record the actual boost dose delivered. 00000 Boost dose therapy was not administered. 88888 Not applicable, brachytherapy or radioisotopes administered to the patient. 99999 Boost radiation therapy was administered, but the dose is unknown. Therapy Data 373 50360 - Number of Treatments To This Volume Field Length: 2 Description Records the total number of treatment sessions (fractions) administered during the first course of treatment. It is an optional field and it is only required for data entry to ACoS flagged hospitals. Rationale This data item is used to evaluate patterns of radiation therapy and the treatment schedules. Instructions for Coding The number of treatments or fractions will typically be found in the radiation oncologist's summary letter for the first course of treatment. Determination of the exact number of treatments or fractions delivered to the patient may require assistance from the radiation oncologist for consistent coding. Although a treatment session may include several treatment portals delivered within relatively confined period of time - usually a few minutes - it is still considered one session. The total number of treatment sessions (fract ions) is the sum of the number of fractions of regional treatment and the number of fractions of boost treatment. Code Label Definition 01-98 Number of Total number of treatment sessions administered to the patient. treatments 99 Unknown Radiation therapy was administered, but the number of treatments is unknown. Or, it is unknown whether radiation therapy was administered. Examples: Code Reason 25 A patient with breast carcinoma had treatment sess ions in which treatment was delivered to the chest wall and separately to the ipsilateral supraclavicular region for a total of three treatment portals. Twenty -five treatment sessions were given. Record 25 treatments. 35 A patient with Stage IIIB bronchogenic carcinoma received 25 treatments to the left hilum and mediastinum, given in 25 daily treatments over five weeks. A left hilar boost was then given in 10 additional treatments. Record 35 treatments. 50 A patient with advanced head and neck cancer was treated using \"r;hyperfractionation.\" Three fields were delivered in each session, two sessions were given each day, six hours apart, with each session delivering a total dose of 150 cGy. Treatment was given for a total of 25 days. Record 50 treatments. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 374 50370 - Date Radiation Ended Field Length: 8 Description The date on which the patient completes or received the last radiation treatment at any facility. It is an optional field and it is only required for data entry to ACoS flagged hospitals. Rationale The length of time over which radiation therapy is administered to a patient is a factor in tumor control and treatment morbidity. It is useful to evaluate the quality of care and the success of patient support programs designed to maintain continuity of treatment. Instructions for Coding The date when treatment ended will typically be found in the radiation oncologist's summary letter for the first course of treatment. Code Definition MMDDCCYY The month, day, and year (MMDDCCYY) radiation therapy ended at any facility. The first two digits are the month, the third and fourth digits are the day, and the last four digits are the year. 88888888 When radiation was administered and was still ongoing at the time of most recent follow -up. The date should be revised at the next follow -up. 99999999 When it is unknown whether any radiation therapy was administered, the date is unknown, or the case was identified by death certificate only.

The surgery codes are identical to FORDS b ut the SEER appendix also contains supplementary annotations, including the 2007 MP/H rules. It is divided into six sections, which can go to: http://www.facs.org/cancer/coc/fords/2007/fordsappendixb0906.pdf . For diagnoses prior to January 1, 2003, use the ROADS surgery codes, which can be found at: http://seer.cancer.gov/manuals/AppendC.pdf 2009 Abstractor's Manual 486 APPENDIX H - TREATMENT AGENTS For cases diagnosed from 2005 onward, the SEER Rx software should be used to identify and categorize treatment agents as chemotherapy, hormone agents, immunotherapy or ancillary agents . (Ancillary agents are not considered treatment.)

THERAPY AGENTS (PRE -2005) Appendices 487 (Alphabetical Listing) Helpful Information *Different names for the same agent are separated by commas (,) within a line. *Individual agents in combo regimens are separated by forward slashes (/). *Some combo regimens consist of chemotherapy and hormone therapy agents (C, H); both categories should be entered as therapies. *When looking up a combo regimen by the individual agents, begin searching fo r the agent that comes alphabetically first. If it is not listed under that agent begin searching for the agent that comes alphabetically next, etc. Remember that agents listed as a part of a combo regimen may be known by different names (synonyms).

ICD- -o-3/. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 514 APPENDIX L - REVISED RACE CODING RULES (Effective with 2004 diagnoses) Race (and ethnicity) is defined by specific physical, hereditary and cultural traditions or origins, not necessarily by birthplace, place of residence, or citizenship. 'Origin' is defined by the US Census Bureau as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or in some cases, the country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States . All resources in the facility, including the medical record, face sheet, physician and nursing notes, photographs, and any other sources, must be used to determine race. If a facility does not print race in the medical record but does maintain it in electronic form, the electronic data must also be reviewed. Recommendation: document how the race code was determined in a text field. Coding Instructions 1. Code the primary race(s) of the patient in fields Race 1, Race 2, Race 3, Race 4, and Race 5. T he five race fields allow for the coding of multiple races consistent with the Census 2000. Rules 2 - 8 further specify how to code Race 1, Race 2, Race 3, Race 4 and Race 5. 2. If a person's race is a combination of white and any other race(s), code the appropriate other race(s) first and code white in the next race field. 3. If a person's race is a combination of Hawaiian and any other race(s), code Race 1 as 07 Hawaiian and code the other races in Race 2, Race 3, Race 4, and Race 5 as appro priate. Example : Patient is described as Japanese and Hawaiian. Code Race 1 as 07 Hawaiian, Race 2 as 05 Japanese, and Race 3 through Race 5 as 88. 4. If the person is not Hawaiian, code Race 1 to the first stated non- white race (02 -98). Example: Patient is stated to be Vietnamese and Black. Code Race 1 as 10 Vietnamese, Race 2 as 02 Black, and Race 3 through Race 5 as 88. Note : in the following scenarios, only the race code referred to in the example is coded. For cases diagnosed after January 1, 2000, all race fields must be coded. 5. The fields Place of Birth, Race, Marital Status, Name, Maiden Name, and Hispanic Origin are inter -related. Use the following guidelines in priority order: a. Code the patient's stated race, if possible. Refer to Appendix \"Race and Nationality Descriptions from the 2000 Census and Bureau of Vital Statistics\" for guidance. Example 1: Patient is stated to be Japanese. Code as 05 Japanese. Example 2: Patient is stated to be German -Irish. Code as 01 White. Example 3: Patient is described as Arabian. Code as 01 White. Exception : When the race is recorded as Oriental, Mongolian, or Asian (coded to 96 Other Asian) and the place of birth is recorded as China, Japan, the Philippines, or another Asian nation, code the race based on birthplace information. Example 4: The person's race is recorded as Asian and the place of birth is recorded as Japan. Code race as 05 Japanese because it is more specific than 96 Asian, NOS. Appendices 515 Example 5: The person describes himself as an Asian -American born in Laos. Code race as 11 Laotian because it is more specific than 96 Asian, NOS. 6. If the patient's race is determined on the basis of the races of relatives, there is no priority to coding race, other tha n to list the non- white race(s) first. Example : The patient is described as Asian -American with Korean parents. Code race as 08 Korean because it is more specific than 96 Asian [ -American]. 7. If no race is stated in the medical record, or if the stated race cannot be coded, review the documentation for a statement of a race category. Example 1 : Patient described as a black female. Code as 02 Black. Example 2: Patient describes herself as multi -racial (nothing more specific) and nurs ing notes say \"African -American.\" Code as 02 Black. Example 3: Patient states she has a Polynesian mother and Tahitian father. Code Race 1 as 25 Polynesian, Race 2 as 26 Tahitian and Race 3 through Race 5 as 88. 8. If race is unknown or not stated in the medical record and birth place is recorded, in some cases race may be inferred from the nationality. Refer to the Appendix entitled \"Race and Nationality Descriptions from the 2000 Census and Bureau of Vital Statistics\" to identif y nationalities from which race codes may be inferred. Example 1: Record states: \"this native of Portugal...\" Code race as 01 White per the Appendix. Example 2 : Record states: \"this patient was Nigerian...\" Code race as 02 Black per the Appendix. Exception: If the patient's name is incongruous with the race inferred on the basis of nationality, code Race 1 through Race 5 as 99, Unknown. Example 1: Patient's name is Siddhartha Rao and birthplace is listed as England. Code Ra ce 1 through Race 5 as 99 Unknown. Example 2: Patient's name is Ping Chen and birthplace is Ethiopia. Code Race 1 through Race 5 as 99 Unknown. 9. Use of patient name in determining race: a. Do not code race from name alone, especially for females with no maiden name given. b. In general, a name may be an indicator of a racial group, but should not be taken as the only indicator of race. c. A patient name may be used to identify a more specific race code. Example 1: Race reported as Asian, name is Hatsu Mashimoto. Code race as 05 Japanese. Example 2: Birthplace is reported as Guatemala and name is Jose Chuicol [name is identified as Mayan]. Code race as 03 Native American d. A patient name may be used to infer Spanish ethnicity or place of birth, but a Spanish name alone (without a statement about race or place of birth) cannot be used to determine the race code. Refer to ethnicity guidelines for further information. Example: Alice Gomez is a native of Indiana (implied birthplace: United States). Code Race 1 through Race 5 as 99 Unknown, because nothing is known about her race. 10. Persons of Spanish or Hispanic origin may be of any race, although persons of Mexican, Central American, South American, Puerto Rican, or Cuban origin are usuall y white. Do NOT code a patient stated to be Hispanic or Latino as 98 Other Race in Race 1 and 88 in Race 2 through Race 5. Example: Sabrina Fitzsimmons is a native of Brazil. Code race as 01 White per Appendix. 11. When the race is recorded as Negro or African -American, code race as 02 Black. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 516 12. Code 03 should be used for any person stated to be Native American or [western hemisphere] Indian, whether from North, Central, South, or Latin America. For Central, South, or Latin Americ an Indians, see additional ethnicity coding guidelines under Spanish Surname or Origin. 13. Death certificate information may be used to supplement antemortem race information only when race is coded unknown in the patient record or when the death certif icate information is more specific. Example 1: In the cancer record Race 1 through Race 5 are coded as 99 Unknown. The death certificate states race as black. Change cancer record for Race 1 to 02 Black and Race 2 through Race 5 to 88. Example 2: Race 1 is coded in the cancer record as 96 Asian. Death certificate gives birthplace as China. Change Race 1 in the cancer record to 04 Chinese and code Race 2 through Race 5 as 88. Race and nationality descriptions from the 2000 Census and Bureau of Vital Statistics can be found at: http://www.seer.cancer.gov/manuals/2007/SPCSM_2007_AppendixD.pdf Appendices 517 APPENDIX M - COMMON HISPANIC SURNAMES A list of frequently occurring heavily Hispanic surnames compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau may be found at: http://www.census.gov/population/documentation/twpno13.pdf on page 20. 2009 Abstractor's Manual 518 APPENDIX N - SUPPLEMENTAL CASEFINDING LIST These ICD -9-CM codes may also be used for casefinding. Many of these codes are for diseases associated with cancer or represent neoplasm -related secondary conditions. Experience among the SEER registries has proven that using the supplementary list significantly improves casefinding outcomes fo r benign brain and CNS tumors, hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms, and other reportable diseases. It is recommended that each registry screen cases using the supplementary list as time permits.
