{"title": "The Magic of Menopause: A Holistic Guide to Get Your Happy Back!", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2022-01-01", "cleaned_text": "As the reader is taken on a journey through anxiety, stress, hot flashes, sex, and sleep issues, there are many suggestions of philosophical approaches that maximize quality of life. Particularly helpful features include space in most chapters for journaling one's thoughts while the teachings of the chapter are fresh. Ms. Miano also artfully weaves descriptions of menopause physiology with women's personal stories as well as recommendations for meditation and recipes for healthy eating. In almost every case for which recommendations are made, the author, who is an Integrative Certified Health Coach, reminds the reader to check with her healthcare provider or health professional before engaging in new activities or diet changes. This is reiterated throughout the book. Ms. Miano has a focused push toward holistic techniques for managing menopause symptoms. She leverages the power of positive thinking, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle. However, there are some topics she covers that may seem a bit controversial to the scientific reader. There is reference to the topic of adrenal fatigue, which is noted in the scientific literature as an entity that may not actually exist. Additionally, there are references to salivary hormone testing, bioidentical hormone use, and multiple, various food supplements. From a purely scientific standpoint, many clinicians feel that safety and efficacy data are lacking on many of these approaches. That said, most of the author's descriptions and recommendations simply promote a healthy lifestyle, free from smoking, alcohol, and processed foods, while encouraging exercise and healthy eating. Though there may be some caution needed on the supplements and related recommendations, the author does repeatedly advise checking with one's own healthcare professional before starting any of the protocols. With the aforementioned caveat of supplement use, the overall tone of the book and the author's approach are quite refreshing, entertaining, and engaging. The additional pages that are made available for note taking, journal entries, and reflection make the book interactive and practically useful. If the reader can focus on the lifestyle changes and approach to overall positive outlook, this book may prove to be a helpful adjunct to navigating the menopause transition. The fact that Ms. Miano refers to herself as \"Your Menopause Fairy Godmother\" and creates a coaching feel throughout her method makes the read very enjoyable indeed. Reviewed by Penny Z.
