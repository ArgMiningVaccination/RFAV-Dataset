To start with, we owe so much to the family members who participated. They were our teachers in many ways, and their generosityand commitment to this project has inspired our belief in the importance of partneringwith families. Elaine Mason of Elmgrove Outpatient Services co-ordinated the family project at our study site in Brockville and continues to actively collaborate in our workshops and com-munity forums throughout the province. We are fortunate to work in an organization that has an explicit priority commitment to concurrent disorders and to families. We have also benefited from the opportunity towork with talented and passionate colleagues who helped to sustain and expand thescope of our project. Christine Bois has been a true champion of concurrent disordercapacity building in Ontario. Monique Bouvier is co-ordinating an ambitious provincialdissemination effort, supported by a great team in CAMH's provincial services. A specialthanks goes to editors Martha Ayim and Jacquelyn Waller-Vintar and designer Eva Katz. And finally we want to thank Caroline Hebblethwaite who managed the development and execution of the manual from the first family group meeting through to the finalproduction. She has been an extraordinarily inspiring guide\u2014resourceful, generous,tireless, skilled and wise.

The familymembers were often overwhelmed as they tried to cope with difficult issues. We know that the mental health and substance use systems could be better at helping families become more resilient, at recognizing the work that family members do everyday to find solutions and resources for problems related to concurrent disorders.Families need help to deal with the impact of concurrent disorders, but families are alsoa key to finding effective solutions. To help their relatives on the journey to recovery,families need: information about substance use and mental health problems\u2014and above all, to know that families do not cause the problems a common language with treatment providers\u2014to make it easier to collaborate strategies to cope with issues associated with concurrent disorders strategies to look after themselves and reduce the impact of their relatives' problems on their own lives. HISTORY OF THE PROJECT In 2004-05, we offered a support and education group to help family members: learn about concurrent disorders develop skills that would help them deal with the impact of concurrent disorders on their family life collaborate with their relatives with concurrent disorders as well as treatment providers to find ways to manage substance use and mental health problems. The feedback we have received\u2014both directly from family members and indirectly from the research measures we took before and after the project\u2014has been extremelypositive, and has motivated us to make our work available to a broader audience. This resource is based on the package of materials that we created for the group. We designed this version so that family members can also use it on their own. It includes: information and educational material quotations from family members resources and contact information tip lists activities. USING THIS RESOURCE How you use this resource will depend on how long you have been coping with concur-rent disorders in your family, on how well your relative is doing and on your learning style. You can look up specific information that will help you with current concerns. Or you can read the resource chapter by chapter. If you read through the entire guide, you willget a good overall understanding of key ideas and of the challenges and opportunitiesthat are part of dealing with a family member who has concurrent disorders. This resource is divided into four parts:Part I: What are concurrent disorders? provides an overview of concurrent disorders, an introduction to treatment options and information about substance use and mentalhealth problems and how they interact. Part II: The impact on families focuses on the impact of concurrent disorders on family life. It includes information on experiencing, understanding and coping with the effectsof stigma and on self-care strategies for family members. Part III: Treatment explores treatment and support for people affected by concurrent disorders. It includes strategies for navigating the mental health and substance use treat-ment systems and information about psychosocial and medication treatment options,recognizing and planning for relapses, and anticipating and coping with crisis situations. Part IV: Recovery talks about the journey to recovery. As you use this resource, you join a host of wonderful people who are committed to play- ing a positive role in the life of a family member who is affected by substance use andmental health problems. We have learned a lot from them\u2014they share their insightsthroughout. We are delighted to have this chance to present what we have learned. Part I: What are concurrentdisorders?1 Outline How common are concurrent disorders? The relationship between substance use and mental health problems The impact of concurrent disorders An introduction to treatmentIntroduction to concurrentdisorders4Introduction to Concurrent Disorders We were just like any other family with teenagers, except that while our daughter was a real extrovert\u2014she had so many friends, did well in school,never caused us any problems\u2014you know, the kind of kid who can do nowrong . . . our son was so different, the complete opposite. He had friendsgrowing up, but then it seemed like, out of the blue, he didn't want to bearound anyone, including his own family. He just got so isolated, youknow? He was always a quiet kid, but this was different. When my husbandcaught him smoking marijuana, and then found bottles of alcohol in hiscloset, it suddenly all started making sense . . . booze and drugs were caus-ing him to crawl into his own little world and withdraw from other people.To tell you the truth, we were actually relieved to find out about his drugproblem\u2014we had a plan, you know? We could do something concrete tohelp him, like put him in rehab for teens. The real nightmare started whenhe wouldn't even go out of the house to see our family doctor. Even whenwe made sure he wasn't smoking pot or drinking, he still got worse! It wasanother two years before we found out that he had a mental illness as wellas a drug problem. We had never heard of concurrent disorders before then. The term concurrent disorders describes a situation where someone has both a sub- stance use problem and a mental health problem at some point in their lifetime. Itcould be in the past. (Has your family member ever had a mental health problem?Has your family member ever had a substance use problem?) Or it could be a currentproblem. (Does your family member currently have both a mental health problemand a substance use problem?) Many families share similar experiences to those of the family whose story is introduced this chapter. Substance use and mental health problems can lead to symptoms andbehaviours that look very similar, so family members and treatment professionals oftenfind it difficult to determine whether the behaviour they are looking at is due to a sub-stance use problem or a mental health problem\u2014or both. This chapter is an introductionto concurrent disorders: how substance use and mental health problems interact the impact of concurrent disorders on the family how concurrent disorders are detected and treated. HOW COMMON ARE CONCURRENT DISORDERS? Having either a substance use or a mental health problem significantly increases the likelihood of having the other. The results of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study(Regier et al., 1990) indicate that a person who has a mental health disorder is almostthree times more likely to have a substance use disorder at some time in his or her lifethan is a person who does not have a mental health disorder. A person who has a substance5Introduction to Concurrent Disorders (other than alcohol) use disorder is about 4.5 times more likely to have a mental health disorder at some point in his or her life than a person who does not have a substanceuse disorder. The prevalence of combinations of substance use and mental health disorders varies depending on the disorder: Among people who have had an anxiety disorder in their lifetime, 24 per cent will have a substance use disorder in their lifetime. Among people who have had major depression in their lifetime, 27 per cent will have a substance use disorder in their lifetime. Among people who have had bipolar disorder in their lifetime, 56 per cent will have a substance use disorder in their lifetime. This is more than three times the average rate. Among people who have had schizophrenia in their lifetime, 47 per cent will have a substance use disorder in their lifetime. This is nearly three times the average rate. People who work in substance use agencies should assume that someone who comes for help with a substance use problem might also have a mental health problem, until theyhave information that indicates that this is not the case. Similarly, mental health workersshould assume that clients might also have a substance use problem, until they haveinformation that rules out this possibility. Understanding the terminology People often have substance use and mental health problems that have a signifi-cant impact on their daily lives, but are not severe enough or do not last longenough to meet the criteria for a diagnosis of any disorder. So, we will usually usethe broader term \"mental health and substance use problems,\" unless we are talk-ing about a specific DSM IV-based ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. ) diagnosis of a disorder. These are terms you will probably hear used in some parts of the substance use and mental health systems. Mental disorders Mental disorders (including substance use disorders) are health conditions that are char- acterized by changes in thinking, mood or behaviour (or some combination of thethree) associated with distress and/or impaired functioning (American PsychiatricAssociation, 1994). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is used in North America to diagnose mental health disorders. The fourth and most recent edition,the DSM-IV, organizes mental disorders into 16 major diagnostic classes\u2014forexample, mood disorders and substance-related disorders. Within these diagnostic6Introduction to Concurrent Disorders classes, disorders are further broken down\u2014for example, depressive disorders and bipolar disorders are included in the mood disorders class. For each disorder, theDSM-IV lists specific criteria for making a diagnosis. While we will use the terms co-occurring problems and concurrent disorders in this manual, there are other terms that you may have heard: Dual diagnosis is often used in the United States. It implies that a person has just two problems. However, evidence suggests that there may well be more. InOntario, this term is used to refer to people with serious developmental delay andsevere, persistent mental illness. Co-occurring disorders (COD) is another way of describing a situation where someone has one or more mental health disorders and one or more substance use disorders. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS Do the substance use behaviours cause psychiatric symptoms? Do the mental health issues lead people to use substances to relieve troubled mental states? The relationshipis usually much more complicated than simple cause and effect. Researchers have suggested four types of interaction: substance use and mental health problems may be triggered by the same factor mental health problems may influence the development of substance use problems substance use problems may influence the development of mental health problems substance use and mental health problems may not interact. The way substance use and mental health problems interact is specific to the person, the mental health problem and the substance being used, and may change over time. SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS MAY BE TRIGGERED BY THE SAME FACTOR Both substance use and mental health problems could be caused by a common factor, that could be genetic, developmental or environmental. For example, traumatic events(an environmental factor) can lead to both mental health and substance use problems.7Introduction to Concurrent Disorders MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS MAY INFLUENCE THE DEVELOP- MENT OF SUBSTANCE USE PROBLEMS Severe mental health problems, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, may leave people more vulnerable to developing substance use problems; they tend to developsubstance use problems with lower amounts of alcohol or other drug use than peoplewho don't have mental health problems. People may use substances in the hope of relieving the symptoms of mental health problems. For example, someone with an anxiety disorder may use alcohol to feel moreat ease in social situations. This is called self-medication. SUBSTANCE USE PROBLEMS MAY INFLUENCE THE DEVELOP- MENT OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS Substance use can induce psychiatric symptoms. For example, a person using signifi- cant amounts of cocaine could become paranoid to the point of being psychotic. Substance use can not only induce psychiatric symptoms, but can also lead to psychoso- cial problems that may in turn lead to mental health problems. Severe paranoia couldlead to psychosocial problems such as trouble in family relationships, trouble at workand trouble with the law. These problems could lead to a mental health problem suchas depression. SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS MAY NOT INTERACT Sometimes, both mental health and substance use problems are present, but do not interact, so that even when one problem area is addressed, the other problem area isstill active. For some people, getting substance use under control will produce immediate positive changes in mental health symptoms. For others, it can mean that their mental healthsymptoms become more active. Understanding the relationship between the substanceuse and mental health problems is key to working successfully with people to choosetreatment strategies and anticipate outcomes. THE IMPACT OF CONCURRENT DISORDERS Co-occurring substance use and mental health problems affect people differently, anddepend on factors such as the combination and severity of the problems. For example,8Introduction to Concurrent Disorders people with severe mental illness who also have substance use problems tend to experi- ence a wide range of serious problems. Common issues include: more severe psychiatric symptoms, such as depression and hallucinations more dramatic effects after using substances, including more blackouts a greater chance of not following treatment plans physical health problems increased experiences of stigma financial problems housing instability and homelessness poorer management of personal affairs serious relationship problems with family members more verbal hostility, tendency to argue, disruptive behaviour, aggression violence or crises that may end up involving the police a greater likelihood of ending up in jail increased suicidal feelings and behaviours. IMPACT ON THE FAMILY Having concurrent disorders obviously affects the person experiencing the disordersdirectly, but they also have powerful effects on family members and friends. As problemsbecome more complex, family members are often confused about which problems arecauses, and which are results. They are often puzzled and frustrated if their relative con-tinues to use alcohol or other drugs when the consequences are so severe. We discussthe impact on the family in Chapter 4 and talk about coping strategies in Chapter 5. AN INTRODUCTION TO TREATMENT Detecting substance use and mental health problems Because of the overlap of symptoms between mental health and substance use disorders, it is often difficult to make a firm diagnosis in the early stages of treatment. For exam-ple, symptoms resulting from intoxication and withdrawal can look a lot like symptomsof mood and anxiety disorders. A period of stopping, or cutting down on, substance useis often necessary before therapists can say whether a client has a substance use problemor a mental health problem\u2014or both. The best way to tell the difference between the symptoms caused by substance-related and other mental health problems is to observe the person when no substances arebeing used. However, experts don't agree on how long the person needs to stop usingsubstances before a separate problem can be identified. Usually, the required period ofabstinence depends on the substances being used and the suspected mental healthproblem. For example, drugs that stay in the body for a long time (e.g., long-acting ben-9Introduction to Concurrent Disorders zodiazepines) may need many weeks of abstinence for withdrawal symptoms to taper off so that an accurate diagnosis can be made. For drugs that stay in the body for a shorterperiod of time (e.g., alcohol, cocaine), both the intoxication and the withdrawal stageswill likely be briefer. In this case, it may be possible to make a firm diagnosis with shorterperiods of abstinence. Where do people find treatment? Substance use services range from withdrawal management services, through community-based assessment and treatment, to short- and long-term residential resources. Mentalhealth services include psychiatric emergency rooms, outpatient mental health clinics,acute-stay hospital beds, extended residential care and assertive community outreachteams for people who previously could only be supported in institutions. Many peopleget treatment for substance use and mental health problems from family doctors orother primary care services. A framework (developed in the United States) illustrates where people are most likely to look for treatment. People may move back and forth among the quadrants at variousstages of recovery from substance use and mental health problems. Figure 1-1: The Quadrant Framework specialized addiction high severity high severit ylow severity substance abuse mental illness integrated primary care specialized mental health A population view 10Introduction to Concurrent Disorders The quadrant framework suggests that where a person has: both substance use and mental health problems of low to moderate severity, pri- mary health care (e.g., family doctors) and community health resources are the core resources to draw on a substance use problem of high severity, with a mental health problem of mild tomoderate severity, specialized substance use services are the lead resources, with mental health services providing collaborative care a mental health problem of high severity, with a substance use problem of mild tomoderate severity, specialized mental health services are the lead resources, with sub- stance use services providing collaborative care both substance use and mental health problems of high severity, strong evidence suggests that integrated care by a single, multidisciplinary team is the most effectiveway to provide continuing care and support. CO-ORDINATED CARE In the past, mental health and substance use services have not been well connected.They have tended to concentrate on one set of problems and view the other as a sec-ondary problem that will clear up once the core problem is addressed. However, weknow that if one of the co-occurring problems is not addressed, both problems usuallyget worse, and additional complications often arise. Most communities have resources that could provide collaborative programming. In some cases, this already happens. In others, services in both systems need to work togethermore effectively to provide client-centred care for people with complex needs. We dis-cusss strategies for navigating the treatment system in Chapter 7. Treatment principles When care for substance use and mental health problems is more co-ordinated andintegrated, people do better. Concurrent disorder treatment initiatives focus on improvedscreening and assessment, more specialized programming, and co-ordination (by oneperson, or a treatment team) of substance use and mental health treatment. Five princi-ples guide how to care for people with co-occurring problems: 1. People with co-occurring disorders are people first. Too often, these individuals pay too high a price for co-occurring disorders (SAMHSA, 2003). 2. Co-occurring problems are under-identified but common.3. Co-occurring problems are complex but understandable.4. Co-occurring problems are challenging but responsive to care.5. Co-occurring problems require responses that go beyond separate addiction and mental health treatment.11Introduction to Concurrent Disorders People who have co-occurring substance use and mental health problems are some of the most vulnerable people in our society and in our health care system. Evidence sug-gests that if we address their problems in more co-ordinated and collaborative ways, theyare more likely to reduce their substance use and improve their mental functioning. Formany people, this is a long, complex process. Often family members are the most con-stant companions in the journey to recovery. At points in the journey, the family may becalled on to be advocate, support person and sometimes case manager. In the rest of theguide we offer tools and strategies to help you do this.

Why do people develop addictions? Types of substances 13Substance use problems14Substance use problems Many people use substances such as alcohol in moderate amounts and don't experience any problems. However, some people may start using larger amounts regularly, or usingsubstances to get intoxicated. These behaviours can lead to problems with a person'sjob, family and health. After repeated abuse, some people may become dependent onthe substance. SUBSTANCE-RELATED DISORDERS There is no clear line that indicates when substance use becomes a problem that issevere enough to need treatment. However, the DSM-IV includes substance-related disorders as one of the classes of mental health disorders. Many clinicians use theDSM's diagnostic criteria for substance abuse and substance dependence to help screen and assess people for concurrent disorders. Substance Abuse People who abuse substances regularly may have ongoing serious problems with-out being dependent on the substance. Some of these problems are: inability to fulfil responsibilities (e.g., being absent from work, doing poorly inschool or neglecting duties at home) dangerous use (e.g., using substances in physically dangerous situations, such aswhen driving a car) legal problems (e.g., being arrested for disorderly conduct following substance use) social and family problems (e.g., arguing with family members about beingintoxicated). If one or more of these problems has a significant impact on a person's life, the person may be diagnosed with a substance abuse disorder. Substance Dependence People who are dependent on substances have major physical, mental and behav-iour problems that can have serious effects on their lives. Some of the signs ofsubstance dependence are: tolerance: the need to use larger and larger amounts of the substance to get thedesired effect, such as intoxication withdrawal: having unpleasant symptoms if substance use stops; continued sub-stance use with the same or similar drugs to avoid or reduce withdrawal symptoms desire to cut down or quit: many unsuccessful attempts to reduce or stop usingthe substance time investment: a great deal of time spent getting the substance, using it orrecovering from its effects15Substance use problems retreat from usual activities: giving up or reducing work, social or recreational activities, and withdrawing from family and friends to use the substance pri-vately or to spend more time with friends who use substances ongoing use: substance use continues despite the negative effects. If three or more of these problems are ongoing during a 12-month period, a per- son may be diagnosed with a substance dependence disorder. A person does not need signs of tolerance or withdrawal to be dependent. For example, people who are dependent on marijuana show a pattern of compulsiveuse without any signs of tolerance or withdrawal. Compulsive use means people keep using substances in spite of the negative consequences, even though theywant to stop and have tried to stop. Many people who are substance dependentalso experience cravings. A craving is an urge or a longing for a substance. Addiction Addiction has been defined in many ways. Some of the technical definitions are similar to the way in which substance dependence is defined (see above). Mostpeople use the term more broadly to refer to compulsive behaviours, includingsubstance use, that cause problems. People persist with these behaviours in spiteof strong negative consequences. If we use this definition, addiction can be thought of as existing on a continuum. Substance abuse is a less severe form of addiction than substance dependence.Other forms of addictive behaviour include smoking, problem gambling and com-pulsive sexual behaviours. WHAT IS THE RISK OF ADDICTION? Research suggests that the risk of addiction varies across behaviours and substances: about two per cent of people who gamble meet diagnostic criteria for problem gambling between five and seven per cent of people who drink alcohol meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence about 10 per cent of people who use cocaine meet diagnostic criteria for cocaine dependence about 80 per cent of smokers meet diagnostic criteria for nicotine dependence\u2014the highest rate of substance dependence. Addictive behaviours are difficult to change because they are activities to which the person becomes strongly attached. They also tend to have immediate positive conse-quences (this is known as positive reinforcement ). People who have stopped an addictive16Substance use problems behaviour sometimes compare it to saying goodbye to a very close friend or leaving a relationship that was very important to them. When helping someone with an addictive behaviour, it is important to understand how attractive the behaviour is to the person. As the behaviour intensifies, it increasingly pre-occupies the person. Other interests and needs tend to become less important, and thebehaviour becomes the primary or only way that the person gets satisfaction, even as thenegative consequences grow. WHY DO PEOPLE DEVELOP ADDICTIONS? Not everyone who engages in a pleasurable behaviour ends up becoming addicted. Atmany levels, behaviours that can become addictive are either encouraged or discour-aged by larger social forces (think of advertising) or by factors that are within the person(biological or psychological). If we understand the ways that behaviours can be power-fully rewarding for people, instead of viewing addictive behaviour as inherently bad ortotally negative, we can begin to have a more sympathetic understanding of the prob-lems of substance dependence and other addictive behaviours. As the biopsychosocial model suggests, the causes of addictive behaviours are complex, and can include the following: A person usually perceives the behaviour itself as being strongly rewarding in some way. The nature of the reward, however, may vary from person to person, and maychange over time. Some individuals may be rewarded by the energizing, exciting orpleasurable effects of a substance or of a behaviour such as gambling. Some people may engage in addictive behaviours because the physiological or psy- chological effects relieve physical or emotional suffering. Addictive behaviours may divert attention from distressing or overwhelming life cir- cumstances. For example, some substances may temporarily lessen the symptomsassociated with anxiety, depression or chronic frustration. Unfortunately, many of thedestructive consequences associated with addictive behaviours\u2014for example, damageto relationships, finances, self-esteem and emotional and physical health; develop-ment of physiological tolerance and ultimately increased anxiety, depression andother symptoms\u2014may draw the person even deeper into his or her addiction. As theconsequences associated with the behaviour grow more severe, a person feels less ableto address the problem. Even when it reaches the point where the person is not get-ting any positive rewards, the person may keep using to avoid the distress of having toquit the behaviour. For example, many people dependent on substances report usingsubstances long after they stop experiencing any pleasant effects.17Substance use problems The biopsychosocial approach to understanding substance dependence BIOLOGICAL FACTORS There is evidence that some people inherit a higher risk of dependent behaviours than others. To have a sibling or a parent with a history of dependence is to be at higher risk.We are learning more about the biological dimensions of addictions. These behavioursthemselves might produce biological changes that make the person more vulnerable torelapsing (returning to the behaviour). PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS Any powerfully rewarding experience encourages a person to repeat the experience.There are many aspects of addictive behaviours\u2014including the rituals, the environmen-tal factors, and the thoughts and feelings that are involved\u2014that can help us understandaddictive behaviours. Usually the rewards from these behaviours show up first, while thecosts tend to follow later or gradually build up over time. When someone feels a power-ful urge, and the reward is immediate, while the negative consequences are nowhere insight, it is tempting to give in to the power of the moment. SOCIAL FACTORS Addictions are strongly shaped by our relationships with other people and by interper-sonal processes. Peer factors help to determine if someone will experiment with a behaviour such as using tobacco, alcohol, marijuana or other drugs that may cause dependency. Availability affects the risk of a behaviour becoming addictive. The increase in opportu- nities to gamble in the western world has led to an increase in the number of peoplewith gambling problems in the region. Making cigarette smoking in public spaces ille-gal, along with higher prices through taxation, has led to significant decreases in thenumbers of people who smoke. Cultural factors also shape what people consider to be acceptable or unacceptable behaviours. 18Substance use problems TYPES OF SUBSTANCES This section describes three major types of substances1: depressants: drugs that slow the central nervous system (CNS) functions (e.g., make people feel more relaxed and less conscious of their surroundings) stimulants: drugs that increase CNS activity (e.g., speed up mental processes to make people feel more alert and energetic) hallucinogens: drugs that alter perceptions and sense of time and place; drugs that can produce hallucinations. The following drug classification chart shows drugs that fall into each of these categories. DEPRESSANTS for Addiction and Mental Health has published 20 brochures describing substances in the D o Y o u K n o w... series. For more information, visit www.camh.net/Publications/CAMH_Publications/ do_you_know_index.html. 19Substance use problems Depressants Depressants include: alcohol (e.g., beer, wine, liquor) opiates, sometimes called narcotics (e.g., heroin and pain medication such as demerol, morphine, codeine) benzodiazepines, sometimes called tranquillizers (e.g., Valium and Ativan, prescribed to help people sleep or to reduce anxiety) barbiturates, sometimes called downers (e.g., Nembutal, Seconal) cough and cold remedies (e.g., Benylin with codeine) allergy medications (e.g., Benadryl and Sudafed) other over-the-counter drugs (e.g., antinausea drugs such as Gravol). Depressants slow your central nervous system and affect the parts of the brain that con- trol thinking, behaviour, breathing and heart rate. Depressant drugs such as alcohol,opioids and benxodiazepines can make you drowsy, slow your reaction time, and hinderyour ability to pay attention or concentrate. The same is true for drugs with depressantside-effects\u2014drugs such as cold remedies, cough medicines, antihistamines to controlallergy symptoms, and drugs to prevent nausea or motion sickness. Mixing any depressant drug with alcohol, which is also a depressant, can be extremely dangerous. The combined effects of the two drugs are sometimes much greater than theeffect of depressant activity) Phencyclidine (PCP)20Substance use problems ALCOHOL Alcohol is the depressant that is used and abused most often. How does alcohol make you feel? The way alcohol affects you depends on many factors, including: your age your gender your body weight how sensitive you are to alcohol the type and amount of food in your stomach how much you drink how often you drink how long you've been drinking how you expect the alcohol to make you feel whether you've taken any other drugs (illegal, prescription, over-the-counter or herbal) whether you have certain pre-existing medical or psychiatric conditions. For many people, a single drink of alcohol releases tension and reduces inhibition, mak- ing them feel more at ease and outgoing. Some people feel happy or excited when theydrink, while others become depressed or hostile. Women are generally more sensitive to the effects of alcohol than men, and all adults become increasingly sensitive to alcohol's effects as they age. When someone is moresensitive, it takes less alcohol to cause intoxication, and more time for the body to elimi-nate the alcohol consumed. Is alcohol dangerous? Alcohol can affect judgment, behaviour, attitude and reflexes. The impact of these effectscan range from embarrassment to unwanted or high-risk sexual contact to violence,injury or death. Alcohol is involved in more regrettable moments, crimes and trafficfatalities than all other drugs of abuse combined. Extreme intoxication can kill, often as the result of the person \"passing out\" while vomiting and choking. Clammy skin, low body temperature, slow and laboured breath-ing and loss of bladder and bowel control are signs of acute alcohol poisoning, whichcan be fatal. Mixing alcohol with other drugs\u2014prescribed or recreational\u2014can have unpredictable results. Alcohol may either block the absorption of the other drug, making it less effec-tive, or it may increase the effect of the other drug, making it dangerous. 21Substance use problems Is alcohol addictive? It can be. Most alcohol-related illnesses, social problems, accidents and deaths are caused by problem drinking . This term describes alcohol use that causes problems in a person's life, but does not include physical dependence. Problem drinking is four times as com-mon as severe alcohol dependence. Physical dependence involves tolerance to alcohol's effects and withdrawal symptoms when drinking is stopped. People who are physically dependent on alcohol can developwithdrawal symptoms, such as sleeplessness, tremors, nausea and seizures within a fewhours after their last drink. Even after long periods of abstinence, a person may continueto crave alcohol, and may begin to drink again. Opiates Opiates include heroin, codeine and morphine. They may be prescribed by a doctor forsevere pain. Under medical supervision, these strong painkillers are safe in the short term. Opiates not only relieve pain, but in excess amounts can cause intoxication, givingthem a high addictive potential. Opiate use is a problem when the person who is usingthem either has no medical reason to use them, or is using the drug in larger amountsthan needed to manage pain. People who are dependent become extremely tolerant tothe drug (they need to increase the amount to get the same level of intoxication) andwill undergo withdrawal if they stop using abruptly. Opiate drugs are often bought illegally. People may fake or exaggerate medical problems when talking to doctors to get prescriptions they don't need, or they may get several prescriptions from different doctors. Sometimes these drugs end up on the streets in the hands of drug dealers. HEROIN Heroin is a dangerous and illegal drug with high addictive potential. How does heroin make you feel? The way heroin, or any drug, affects you depends on many factors, including: your age how much you take how often you take it how long you've been taking it the method you use to take the drug whether you've taken any alcohol or other drugs (illegal, prescription, over-the- counter or herbal) whether you have certain pre-existing medical or psychiatric conditions. 22Substance use problems When heroin is injected into a vein, it produces a surge of euphoria, or a \"rush.\" This effect is felt in seven to eight seconds, and lasts from 45 seconds to a few minutes. Theinitial effect with snorting or smoking is not as intense. Following the rush comes a periodof sedation and tranquility known as being \"on the nod,\" which may last up to an hour.When heroin is injected under the skin or into a muscle, the effect comes on more slowly,within five to eight minutes. New users often experience nausea and vomiting. The desired effects include detachment from physical and emotional pain and a feeling of well-being. Other effects include slowedbreathing, pinpoint pupils, itchiness and sweating. Regular use results in constipation, loss of sexual interest and libido, and an irregular or a stopped menstrual cycle in women. Heroin use causes changes in mood and behaviour. People who are dependent on heroin may be docile and compliant after taking heroin, and irritable and aggressiveduring withdrawal. How long does the feeling last? Regardless of how it is taken, the effects of heroin generally last for three to five hours,depending on the dose. People who are dependent on heroin must use every six to 12 hours to avoid symptoms of withdrawal. The initial symptoms are intense, and include runny nose, sneezing,diarrhea, vomiting, restlessness and a persistent craving for the drug. Also associatedwith withdrawal are goosebumps and involuntary leg movements, leading to theexpressions \"cold turkey\" and \"kicking the habit.\" Withdrawal symptoms peak within a couple of days, and usually fade within five to 10 days. Other symptoms, such asinsomnia, anxiety and craving may continue for some time. Heroin withdrawal is notlife-threatening, but can be extremely uncomfortable. Is heroin dangerous? Yes. Overdose is the most immediate danger of heroin use. Heroin depresses the part ofthe brain that controls breathing. In an overdose, breathing slows, and may stop com-pletely. A person who has overdosed is unconscious and cannot be roused, and has cold,moist and bluish skin. A heroin overdose can be treated at a hospital emergency roomwith drugs, such as naloxone, which block heroin's depressant effects. The risk of overdose is increased by: the unknown purity of the drug, which makes it difficult to determine the correct dose, and harder to protect from overdose (ironically, many overdoses are due to increasesin the quality of the drug sold on the street) injection, because the drug reaches the brain more quickly than by other ways of taking the drug, and because the dose is taken all at once combining heroin with other sedating drugs, such as alcohol, benzodiazepines and methadone.23Substance use problems Other dangers associated with heroin use include the following: Consequences of injection: Injection drug use puts the user at high risk not only of overdose, but also of bacterial infection, blood poisoning, abscesses, endocarditis (aninfection of the lining of the heart) and collapsed veins. Sharing needles greatly increasesthe risk of becoming infected with, or spreading, HIV and hepatitis B or C. Unknown content of the drug: For example, heroin is often cut with additives that may be poisonous, such as strychnine, or that do not dissolve and can clog blood vessels,such as chalk. Combining heroin with other drugs: Taking heroin with another drug such as cocaine (speedballs) results in unpredictable, and sometimes deadly, drug interactions in thebody. Dependence: The constant need to obtain heroin, and the repeated use of the drug, can result in criminal involvement or other high-risk behaviour, breakdown of familylife, loss of employment and poor health. Pregnancy: Women who use heroin regularly often miss their periods; some mistakenly think that they are infertile, and become pregnant. Continued use of heroin duringpregnancy is very risky for the baby. Is heroin addictive? Yes. Regular use of heroin, whether it is injected, snorted or smoked, can lead to physi-cal and psychological dependence within two to three weeks. Not all people who experiment with heroin become dependent. Some use the drug only on occasion, such as on weekends, without increasing the dose. With regular usehowever, tolerance to the effects of the drug develops, and more and more heroin isneeded to achieve the desired effect. Continuous use of increasing amounts of the druginevitably leads to dependence. Once dependence is established, stopping use can be extremely difficult. People who have used heroin for a long time often report that they no longer get any pleasure fromthe drug. They continue to use heroin to avoid the symptoms of withdrawal, and to con-trol the powerful craving for the drug, which is often described as a \"need.\" Cravingsmay persist long after the drug is discontinued, making relapse (beginning to use again)difficult to avoid. Stimulants Stimulants include: cocaine and \"crack\" (a potent form of cocaine) amphetamines such as methamphetamine ecstasy caffeine in coffee, tea, cola drinks, \"power\" drinks and \"stay-awake\" pills over-the-counter medications such as allergy medicines (e.g., Sudafed). 24Substance use problems Stimulants increase activity in the central nervous system, including the brain. For exam- ple, they speed up mental processes and make people feel more alert and energetic. Butwhile a drug such as caffeine may make you more alert, it still leaves you impaired, andwhen it wears off, sometimes quickly, it leaves you very tired and less alert. COCAINE People who use cocaine can become dependent after using it for short periods of time.An early sign of cocaine dependence is when a person finds it harder and harder toresist using cocaine whenever it is available. Crack is a commonly used form of cocaine. Unlike other types of cocaine, it is easily turned into a vapour and inhaled. As a result, its effects are immediate. Because cocaine breaks down in the body quickly, people frequently find they need to use cocaine often to maintain a high. People who are dependent can spend hugeamounts of money on the drug in a short period. To get the large amounts of moneyneeded, they may become involved in theft, prostitution or drug dealing. A person whois cocaine-dependent may often need to stop using for a few days to find more money to buy the drug. Tolerance to cocaine occurs after repeated use. Withdrawal symptoms, particularly a poor mood, may occur but they often do not last long. How does cocaine make you feel? How cocaine makes you feel depends on: your age how much you use how often you use how long you use how you take it (e.g., by injection, orally or snorting) your mood how you expect it to make you feel whether you've taken any alcohol or other drugs (illegal, prescription, over-the- counter or herbal) whether you have certain pre-existing medical or psychiatric conditions. Cocaine increases heartbeat, breathing, blood pressure and body temperature. It makes people feel energetic, talkative, alert and euphoric. They feel more aware of their senses,such as sound, touch and sight. Hunger and the need for sleep are reduced. Althoughcocaine is a stimulant, some people find it calming, and feel increased self-control, confi-dence and ease with others. Other people may feel nervous and agitated, and can't relax. 25Substance use problems Taking high doses of cocaine for a long time can lead to: panic attacks psychotic symptoms, such as paranoia (feeling overly suspicious, jealous or perse- cuted), hallucinations (seeing, hearing or smelling things that aren't really there) anddelusions (having false beliefs) erratic, bizarre and sometimes violent behaviour. With regular use, people may become tolerant to the euphoric effects of cocaine. This means that they need to take more and more of the drug to get the same desired effect,or that they get less effect from the same amount of the drug. At the same time, peoplewho use the drug regularly may also become more sensitive to its negative effects, suchas anxiety, psychosis (hallucinations, loss of contact with reality) and seizures. Is cocaine dangerous? Yes. While many people use cocaine on occasion without harm, the drug can be verydangerous. Whether it's used once or often: Cocaine causes the blood vessels to thicken and constrict, reducing the flow of oxygen to the heart. At the same time, cocaine causes the heart muscle to work harder, lead-ing to heart attack or stroke, even in healthy people. Cocaine raises blood pressure, which can explode weakened blood vessels in the brain. A person can overdose on even a small amount of cocaine. Overdose can cause seizures and heart failure. It can also cause breathing to become weak or stop alto-gether. There is no antidote to cocaine overdose. Snorting cocaine can cause sinus infections and loss of smell. It can damage tissues in the nose and cause holes in the bony separation between the nostrils inside the nose(nasal septum). Smoking cocaine can damage the lungs and cause \"crack lung.\" Symptoms include severe chest pains, breathing problems and high body temperatures. Crack lung canbe fatal. Injecting cocaine can cause infections from used needles or impurities in the drug. Sharing needles can also lead to a person getting, or spreading, hepatitis or HIV. Chronic use can cause severe psychiatric symptoms, including psychosis, anxiety, depression and paranoia. Cocaine use is linked with risk-taking and violent behaviours. It is also linked to poor concentration and judgment, increasing risk of injury and sexually transmitted diseases. Chronic use can cause weight loss, malnutrition, poor health, sexual problems, infer- tility and loss of social and financial supports. Cocaine use in pregnancy may increase the risk of miscarriage and premature delivery. It also increases the chance that the baby will be born underweight. Because womenwho use cocaine during pregnancy often also use alcohol, nicotine and other drugs,we do not fully know the extent of the effects of cocaine use on the baby. Cocaine use while breastfeeding transmits cocaine to the nursing child. This exposes the baby to all the effects and risks of cocaine use.26Substance use problems Is cocaine addictive? It can be. Not everyone who uses cocaine becomes dependent, but if they do, it can be one of the hardest drug habits to break. People who become dependent on cocaine lose control over their use of the drug. They feel a strong need for cocaine, even when they know it causes them medical, psycholog-ical and social problems. Getting and taking cocaine can become the most importantthing in their lives. Smoking crack, with its rapid, intense and short-lived effects, is most addictive. However, any method of taking cocaine can lead to dependence. The amount of drug used, andhow often people use the drug, has an effect on whether they become dependent. Cocaine causes people to \"crash\" when they stop using it. When they crash, their mood swings rapidly from feeling high to distress. This brings powerful cravings for more ofthe drug. Bingeing to stay high leads quickly to dependence. Symptoms of cocaine withdrawal can include exhaustion, extended and restless sleep or sleeplessness, hunger, irritability, depression, suicidal thoughts and intense cravings formore of the drug. The memory of cocaine euphoria is powerful, and carries a strongrisk of relapse to drug use. Hallucinogens ecstasy (sometimes called \"the love drug\") solvents (e.g., glue, paint thinner, gasoline) ketamines (a painkiller originally developed to treat animals; sometimes called \"special K\"). The term hallucinogen is used to describe drugs that produce distortions of reality. Hallu- cinogens are sometimes called \"psychedelic drugs.\" Hallucinogens dramatically affectperception, emotions and mental processes. They distort the senses and can cause hal-lucinations. Hallucinations are sensory images similar to dreams or nightmares\u2014a personmay see, taste or hear things that are not really present, except they occur when a personis awake. 27Substance use problems CANNABIS Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in Canada (after alcohol and tobacco use by minors). However, most cannabis use is infrequent and experimental. Research has shown that THC and other pure cannabinoids can relieve nausea and vomiting and stimulate appetite. This can help people who have AIDS or who takedrugs used to treat cancer. While there is plenty of anecdotal evidence, further researchis needed to establish the medical value of marijuana in relieving pain, reducing musclespasms and controlling some types of epileptic seizures. How does cannabis make you feel? How cannabis makes you feel depends on: your age how much you use how often you use how long you've been using it whether you smoke it or swallow it your mood how you expect it to make you feel whether you've taken any alcohol or other drugs (illegal, prescription, over-the- counter or herbal) whether you have certain pre-existing medical or psychiatric conditions. At low doses, cannabis mildly distorts perception and the senses. People who use it say the drug makes music sound better, colours appear brighter and moments seemlonger. They say it enhances taste, touch and smell and makes them feel more awareof their body. Smoking large amounts may intensify some of the desired effects, but is also more likely to produce an unpleasant reaction. Too high a dose may induce the feeling of losingcontrol, confusion, agitation, paranoia and severe anxiety attacks that resemble panicattacks. Pseudohallucinations (seeing things such as pattern and colour that you knoware not real) or true hallucinations (where you lose touch with reality) can occur. Is cannabis dangerous? While no one has ever died of a cannabis overdose, those who use cannabis should beaware of the following possible dangers: Cannabis impairs depth perception, attention span and concentration; it slows reac- tion time, and decreases muscle strength and hand steadiness\u2014all of which mayaffect a person's ability to drive or operate machinery safely. Cannabis and alcohol, when taken together, intensify each other's effects, and cause severe impairment. 28Substance use problems Cannabis intoxication affects thinking and short-term memory. Illegal cannabis products are not subject to any health and safety standards and may be contaminated with other drugs, pesticides or toxic fungi. Large doses of potent cannabis, especially when swallowed, can cause \"toxic psy- chosis.\" Symptoms include auditory and visual hallucinations (hearing or seeing thingthat are not really there), confusion and amnesia (partial or complete memory loss). Is cannabis addictive? It can be. People who use cannabis regularly can develop psychological or mild physicaldependence. People with psychological dependence crave the high. The drug becomes overly impor- tant to them, they may feel they need it, and if they can't get it, they may feel anxious. Long-term, frequent use can lead to physical dependence . People with physical depend- ence may experience mild withdrawal symptoms if they suddenly stop using cannabis.Symptoms can include irritability, anxiety, upset stomach, loss of appetite, sweating anddisturbed sleep. 29Substance use problems Activity 2-1: Identifying substance categories Some of the substances may fit into more than one category. Match the sub- stances to the primary category in which they belong: If you think the substance belongs in the depressant category, write the letter Dbeside it. If you think the substance belongs in the stimulant category, write the letter Sbeside it. If you think the substance belongs in the hallucinogen category, write the letterH beside Department of Health and Human Services. (1999). Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General.

Mental health disorders Personality disordersMental health problems32Mental health problems WHY DO PEOPLE DEVELOP MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS? We don't know exactly what causes mental health problems, nor can we predict who will have a few episodes and who will develop chronic problems. However, it's becom-ing more apparent that a mix of biological, psychological and social factors influencethe development of mental health problems. That is why the biopsychosocial approachcan be helpful in understanding key factors in what can be a very complex explanation.One way of explaining how biological, psychological and social factors influence oneanother is to look at stress and vulnerability. The stress-vulnerability model In general, the stress-vulnerability model holds that the greater the number of possi-ble causes that are present, the greater the risk that a person may develop a mentalhealth problem. Treatment for mental health problems involves decreasing stress factors (e.g., working to develop a strong social network) and finding ways to decrease vulnerability (e.g.,developing better coping skills or using medication to help balance chemical processesin the brain. STRESS Although stress does not cause mental health problems, it can trigger them, or makethem worse. Social factors Events, either in childhood or adulthood, can contribute to the onset of a mental healthproblem. For example, some studies suggest that early childhood trauma and losses, suchas the death or separation of parents, or adult events, such as the death of a partner orchild or loss of a job, can be precursors to a mental health problem. Other environmentalrisk factors include: living in poverty lack of social support. VULNERABILITY Biological factors Biological vulnerability is the tendency to develop problems in a specific area of thebody\u2014for example, respiratory system problems such as asthma. Similarly, people can33Mental health problems have a biological tendency to develop mental health problems such as depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Vulnerability doesn't mean that problems will happen. It means that if certain factors come together, a person has a higher risk of developing a problem, and a higher risk ofthe problem being more severe. Genetics Some mental health problems seem to be genetic, or run in families. For example, therate of schizophrenia in the general population is about one per cent. That rises tonine per cent for a child with one sibling with the diagnosis, 13 per cent for a childwith one parent with the diagnosis and 46 per cent for a child with both parents withthe diagnosis. 2 Brain chemistryResearch indicates that chemical processes in the brain are involved in the developmentof mental health problems. Recent research has also pointed to abnormalities in brainstructure as a possible factor in the development of mental health problems, particularlyschizophrenia. 3 Psychological factorsThe temperament a person is born with (e.g., a tendency to internalize feelings) mayplay a part in increasing the risk of developing mental health problems. Psychologicalrisk factors include: poor social skills poor coping skills problems with communication. MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS As with substance use problems, there is no clear line that indicates when problemsbecome severe enough to warrant treatment. As we explained in Chapter 1, many cli- nicians use the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria to help screen and assess people for mentalhealth disorders. Most people with mental health problems will receive a specific diagno-sis at some point during treatment. However, because the symptoms of many disordersare similar, the diagnosis may change several times during the course of treatment. 2You can find more information about research into the role of genetics on the Psychosis Sucks! website, created by the Fraser Health Authority in British Columbia, at www.psychosissucks.ca/epi. 3The National Institute of Mental Health in the United States (www.nimh.nih.gov/) is a good source ofinformation about new developments in research into the biological basis of mental health problems.34Mental health problems You may hear mental health and substance use service providers use the terms Axis I disorder and Axis II disorder. The DSM-IV uses five axes to help organize information about mental disorders: Axis I: all mental health disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, substance dependence disorder) except personality disorders and mental retardation (also calledintellectual disability) Axis II: personality disorders and mental retardation Axis III: medical conditions that may be contributing to psychological problems (e.g., infectious diseases) Axis IV: psychosocial and environmental problems (e.g., housing problems) Axis V: global assessment of functioning (how well a person is coping with daily life). Axis II disorders are much less straightforward and even harder to diagnose than Axis I disorders. Dimensional approaches Another way to understand mental health problems is to divide mental health problemsinto broad groups based on the behaviours that we see. We did this in Chapter 2 withsubstance use problems by suggesting that drugs that have psychoactive effects couldbe divided into three groups: depressants, stimulants and hallucinogens. We suggest that mental health problems can be divided into four groups: anxiety mood psychosis impulsivity (Skinner, 2005). Mental health problems are described in terms of the severity of behaviours in each of these groups. This dimensional approach is a useful way to begin to organize the obser-vations that indicate that a person has a mental health problem. 35Mental health problems Table 3-1: The dimensional approach DIMENSIONVERBAL BEHAVIOURMENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMSUBSTANCE USE narcissisticpersonalitydisorder histrionicpersonalitydisordersubstance-inducedimpulsecontroldisorder (e.g.,amphetamine-inducedsexualdisorder)36Mental health problems ANXIETY Anxiety disorders take on different forms. They are the most common type of mental health disorder. They have different causes and symptoms, but one thing people withanxiety disorders share is feelings of deep anxiety and fear that affect their mood, think-ing and behaviour. When someone has an anxiety disorder, his or her thoughts andfeelings may get in the way of taking the actions needed to be healthy and productive.These illnesses are chronic and can get worse over time if they are not treated. Thefollowing anxiety disorders: posttraumatic stress disorder generalized anxiety disorder panic disorder social phobia obsessive-compulsive disorder are described below. POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER As we discussed in Chapter 1, many people who develop substance use and/or mentalhealth problems have experienced, or are experiencing, sexual, physical, psychologicalor emotional trauma. Experiencing a traumatic event may trigger mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, psychotic symptoms or personality disorders (SAMHSA, 2003). The DSM-IVdiagnostic category posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) describes a set of symptomsthat people may experience following a traumatic event. Simple posttraumatic stress disorder PTDS may develop after a person experiences or sees an event where serious physicalharm occurred or was threatened. Symptoms include: re-experiences of the event through flashbacks, nightmares or memories intense anxiety intense agitation increased heart rate tremors sweating increased awareness of the environment (hypervigilence) avoidance of anything associated with the traumatic event. PTSD is diagnosed when symptoms last more than one month. Simple PTSD accurately describes the symptoms that can result when a person experiences aone-time event such as a car accident or a natural disaster. 37Mental health problems Complex posttraumatic stress disorder Clinicians and researchers have found that the current DSM-IV PTSD diagnosis often does not capture the severe psychological harm that occurs when the trau-matic experience continues for a long time. For example, ordinary, healthy peoplewho experience chronic trauma can experience changes in the way they see them-selves and in the way they adapt to stressful events. Dr. Judith Herman suggeststhat a new diagnosis, called \"complex PTSD\" (sometimes called \"disorder ofextreme stress\"), is needed to describe the symptoms of long-term trauma. Experiences that can lead to complex PTSD include: long-term domestic violence long-term, severe physical abuse child sexual abuse internment in a concentration or prisoner of war camp. The first requirement for the complex PTSD diagnosis is that the person experienced a prolonged period in a situation in which he or she felt helpless or trapped. Symptoms include alterations in: emotional regulation (e.g., persistent sadness, suicidal thoughts, explosive anger or inhibited anger) consciousness (e.g., forgetting traumatic events, reliving traumatic events or havingepisodes in which one feels detached from one's mental processes or physical body) self-perception (e.g., a sense of helplessness, shame, guilt, stigma and a sense ofbeing completely different than other human beings) the perception of the perpetrator (e.g., attributing total power to the perpetra-tor or becoming preoccupied with the relationship to the perpetrator, includinga preoccupation with revenge) relations with others (e.g., isolation, distrust or a repeated search for a rescuer) one's system of meanings (e.g., a loss of sustaining faith or a sense of hopeless-ness and despair). Survivors may avoid thinking and talking about trauma-related topics because the feelings associated with the trauma are often overwhelming. Survivors (anywherefrom 50 to 90 per cent) may use alcohol and other substances as a way to avoidand numb feelings and thoughts related to the trauma. Survivors may also engagein self-mutilation and other forms of self-harm. Crises that threaten the safety of the person with PTSD (e.g., talking about suicide) or the safety of others (e.g., reacting violently when they feel threatened), must be addressedfirst. However, the best treatment results are achieved when both PTSD and the otherdisorder(s) are treated together rather than one after the other. This is especially true forPTSD and alcohol and other substance use. 38Mental health problems GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER People who have experienced at least six months of ongoing and excessive anxiety and tension may have generalized anxiety disorder. They usually expect the worst and worryabout things, even when there is no sign of problems. They often experience the fol-lowing symptoms: insomnia fatigue trembling muscle tension headaches irritability hot flashes. PANIC DISORDER Panic disorder occurs when people have repeated panic attacks, the sudden onset ofintense fear or terror. During these attacks, people may experience physical symptoms such as: shortness of breath heart palpitations chest pain or discomfort choking or smothering sensations fear of losing control fear of going crazy. Many people with panic disorder develop anxieties about places or situations in which they fear another attack, or where they might not be able to get help. Eventually this candevelop into agoraphobia, a fear of going into open or public spaces. Women are twice aslikely as men to develop panic disorder, which usually begins in young adulthood. SOCIAL PHOBIA People with social phobia experience a significant amount of anxiety and self-conscious-ness in everyday social situations. They worry about being judged by others and embar rassed by their own actions. This anxiety can lead them to avoid potentially humiliating situa-tions. Other symptoms such as blushing, sweating, trembling, problems talking or nauseacan also occur. Women are twice as likely as men to develop social phobia, which typi-cally begins in childhood and early adolescence. OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER People with this condition have obsessive, unwanted thoughts that cause marked anxietyor distress and/or compulsions to behave in certain ways to manage the anxiety. They39Mental health problems may perform rituals to prevent or make the obsessive thoughts go away (e.g., excessive hand washing or cleaning to prevent or diminish their fear of germs). These behavioursbring only temporary relief. If they are not treated, these obsessions and compulsionscan take over a person's life. Mood Ordinarily, people experience a wide range of moods. They feel more or less in control of their moods. When the sense of control is lost, people experience d istress. Those with an elevated mood (mania) can experience expansiveness, rac ing thoughts, decreased sleep, exaggerated self-esteem and grandiose ideas. People with depressed mood (depres- sion) can have symptoms such as a loss of energy and interest, feelings of guilt anddifficulty concentrating. Major depressive disorder Prevalence Between 15 and 20 per cent of women and between 10 and 15 per cent of men will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime. Symptoms A person who is experiencing at least five of the following symptoms meets the cri- teria for a diagnosis of a major depressive episode: Depressed mood: A depressed mood is much different from sadness. In fact,many people with depression say they cannot feel sadness, and many peoplecannot cry when depressed. Being able to cry again often means the depressionis improving. Loss of interest or pleasure: At the start of depression or with mild depression,people can still enjoy and be distracted by pleasurable activities. When peopleare severely depressed, they lose these abilities. Weight loss or gain: Many people lose weight when depressed, partly becausethey lose their appetite. However, some people feel hungrier and may develop acraving for carbohydrate-rich foods. This causes them to gain weight. Dependingon the type of depression, a person's metabolism may speed up or slow down.This can also cause weight loss or gain. Sleep problems: Sleep problems are common in depression. Many people haveinsomnia. They have trouble falling asleep, wake up often during the night, orwake up very early in the morning. They do not find sleep to be restful and maywake up feeling exhausted. Others may find that they sleep too much, especiallyduring the day. This is called hypersomnia . 40Mental health problems Physical changes: For some people with depression, their movements, speech and/or thinking slows. In severe cases, they may be unable to move, speak orrespond. With other people, the opposite happens. They become agitated andcannot sit still. They may pace, wring their hands or show their agitation inother ways. Loss of energy: People with depression find it difficult to complete everydaychores. It takes them much longer to perform tasks at work or home becausethey lack energy and drive. Feelings of worthlessness and guilt: When depressed, people may lack self-confi-dence. They may not assert themselves and may be overwhelmed by feelings ofworthlessness. Many people cannot stop thinking about past events. They obsessabout having let others down or having said the wrong things, and they feel guilty. In severe cases, the guilt may cause delusions. (See \"Psychotic symptoms,\" threebullets below.) Inability to concentrate or make decisions: People may not be able to do simpletasks or make decisions on simple matters. Suicidal thoughts: People with depression often think that life is not worth livingor that they would be better off dead. There is a high risk that they will act onthese thoughts. Many people do try to kill themselves when depressed. Psychotic symptoms: These may include false beliefs, such as believing they arebeing punished for past sins. People with psychotic symptoms may believe thatthey have a terminal illness, such as cancer. They may also hear voices that arenot there (auditory hallucinations). Other symptoms may include: oversensitivity and preoccupation with oneself negative thinking little response to reassurance, support, feedback or sympathy less awareness of other's feelings because of one's own internal pain feeling a need to control relationships inability to function in a normal role. Course A first episode of depression can occur anytime in a person's life.Most people struggle for long periods with the symptoms before seeking mental health intervention. They may have undergone several stressful events, and havetried to manage their mood fluctuations, only seeking help when they experienceserious difficulties coping at home, at work or in important relationships. A person may be diagnosed as having had a \"single episode\" (meaning that this is the first time he or she has experienced a major depression) or \"recurrent episode\"41Mental health problems (meaning that the person has experienced at least one previous episode of major depression). Different episodes may vary in severity: some episodes may be minorand have less impact on a person's ability to function, while others may be moresevere and result in significant disruption to a person's life. Bipolar disorder Prevalence About one to two per cent of the population will develop a bipolar disorder in their lifetime. Symptoms There are three major groups of symptoms related to bipolar disorder. These are mania, hypomania and depression. ManiaIf a person's mood is abnormally or persistently high for at least one week, he or she may be in a manic phase of the illness. However, not everyone who enters themanic phase feels euphoric. Some people may feel extremely irritable, behave rudelyor become angry, disruptive and aggressive. They can be very impatient with othersand make hurtful statements or behave impulsively or even dangerously. In addition to mood symptoms, people must have at least three of the following symptoms to a significant degree to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder: exaggerated self-esteem or grandiosity reduced need for sleep increased talkativeness a flood of ideas or racing thoughts speeding up of activities such as talking and thinking, which may be disorganized poor judgment psychotic symptoms such as delusions (false beliefs) and in some cases halluci-nations (mainly hearing voices). Mania causes people to be emotional and react strongly to situations. For people with poor anger management skills or with low tolerance for frustration, this canlead to violent behaviour. Hypomania Hypomania is a milder form of mania with less severe symptoms. However, symp- toms can interfere with the person's ability to function. We now recognize that42Mental health problems hypomania has more impact on a person's life and relationships than was previously recognized. Depression Depressive episode symptoms are described earlier in this chapter, in the \"Major Depressive Disorders\" section. Bipolar I disorderSome people experience mania or depression, or both, in addition to well phases during their illness. Bipolar II disorderSome people experience hypomania, depression and phases without symptoms\u2014 with no full manic phases. Course The manic/hypomanic, depressive and mixed (both manic/hypomanic and depres- sive) states usually do not occur in a particular order. How often they occur cannotbe predicted. For many people, there are years between each episode, whereas othershave episodes more often. Over a lifetime, the average person with bipolar illnessexperiences about 10 episodes of depression and mania/hypomania or mixed states.As the person ages, the episodes of illness come closer together. Untreated maniaoften lasts for two or three months. Untreated depression usually lasts longer, bet-ween four and six months. One in five people with bipolar disorder have four or more\u2014sometimes many more\u2014episodes a year and have short phases without symptoms. This is calledrapid cycling, and is a subtype of bipolar disorder for which people need specifictreatment. The cause of rapid cycling isn't known. Sometimes, it may be triggeredby antidepressants, but how this happens is not clear. In some cases, stopping theantidepressant may help the person return to a \"normal\" cycling pattern. Psychosis A psychotic disorder is a severe medical illness that disturbs the way a person acts, thinks,sees, hears or feels, and makes it difficult or impossible for him or her to distinguishbetween what is real and what is not. 43Mental health problems Symptoms of psychosis may be either positive (something \"added to\" the person, some- thing that is not always present) or negative (something \"taken away\" or \"missing from\"the person). Schizophrenia Prevalence About one per cent of the population will develop schizophrenia at some point during their life. Symptoms Early warning signs of schizophrenia include: withdrawal from regular activities and from family and friends problems concentrating lack of energy confusion sleep problems unusual speech, thoughts or behaviour (e.g., a person may become intensely preoccupied with religion or philosophy). This early phase can last weeks or months.The seriousness of symptoms and chronic nature of schizophrenia can often cause a high degree of disability. Coping can also be difficult for family members whoremember the person before the illness. Positive symptoms (symptoms that appear in a person) include: Delusions: A delusion is a false or irrational personal belief. About one-third of people with schizophrenia experience delusions. These can include feelings ofbeing persecuted, cheated or harassed, as well as delusions of grandeur (a falseidea of oneself, e.g., as being famous). Hallucinations: A hallucination occurs when a person hears, sees, tastes orexperiences something that is not really there. Hearing voices is the most com-mon hallucination. Disordered thoughts: A person's thoughts may become unconnected, so thatconversations no longer make sense. Their thoughts may come and go and theymay not be able to focus for long on one thought. This is called thought disor-der. It can contribute to a person's isolation. Cognitive difficulties: A person may have problems with memory, concentrationand understanding concepts.44Mental health problems Decline in social or occupational functioning: A person may have problems with work or school, or have trouble taking care of him- or herself. Disorganized behaviour: A person may seem agitated for no particular reason. People with schizophrenia often have negative symptoms (elements that are taken away from a person) that include a \"blunted affect\" or \"flat affect.\" This meansthey find it hard to show or express feelings. They may feel empty. A person withschizophrenia may appear extremely apathetic, have reduced motivation and with-draw socially. Course Men and women are equally likely to develop schizophrenia. However, men tend to have their first episode in their late teens or early twenties. With women, theonset is usually a few years later. In most cases, the illness can start so graduallythat people will start to have symptoms, but they and their families may not beaware of the illness for a long time. Symptoms of schizophrenia tend to vary in intensity over time. Some people have a mild form, and may only have symptoms for a few short periods during theirlives. Others experience symptoms almost all the time, and may need to spendtime in a hospital to protect themselves or others. Impulsivity Impulsivity disorders problems result from behaviour where the urge to do something isgreater than the person's ability to understand that the behaviour has a high risk of beingharmful to him- or herself or others. Examples of impulsivity problems include substance use disorders and other behaviours such as problem gambling, antisocial behaviour, and problems related to anger andaggression. A person with impulsivity problems needs to learn to think before acting. Too often the person reacts to a situation, and the action has consequences that could have been anti-cipated if her or she had sought more information and reflected more before acting. Impulsive behaviour is often an attempt to control a situation that feels unsafe or threat- ening. In a smaller percentage of cases, the person doesn't care about the impact of hisor her behaviour on others or even himself or herself. This type of behaviour is likely tobe diagnosed as conduct disorder in young people or as antisocial behaviour in adults. 45Mental health problems PERSONALITY DISORDERS Personality is a way of describing how people think, feel and behave: the particular ways in which they understand and react to situations (e.g., their emotional response to anupsetting situation, their usual way of coping with stress, or how they understand andreact to the external world). Certain types of mental health problems are called personality disorders. As we saw when we looked at Table 3-1: The Dimensional Approach on p. 35, personality disorders areAxis II disorders. Axis II disorders are much less straightforward and are even harder to diagnose than Axis I disorders. Many of the features of these diagnoses (such as border- line personality disorder or antisocial personality disorder) overlap with many elements ofanybody's personality. Personality disorders are often diagnosed when particular ele- ments of a person's behaviours, reactions and perceptions of the world are extreme and lead to significant adverse problems in his or her life. Personality disorders can have symptoms that are similar to mood, anxiety, psychotic and impulsivity disorders. Diagnosing personality disorders is open to error. The diagnosis isoften used to describe a set of symptoms that don't fit into any other category. Some practitioners do not even consider personality disorders to be mental health prob- lems. Our view is that personality disorders are problems that a person experiences, andneed to be seen as problems for which help should be provided. Clusters of personality disorders The DSM-IV divides personality disorders into three main groups, each of which fits into one of the dimensions we have previously outlined (psychosis, impulsivity and anxiety). Cluster A (psychosis dimension) consists of schizoid personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder and paranoid personality disorder. It is characterized by disturbancesin cognition and perceptual organization in ways that resemble psychotic processes,although are usually less severe. Cluster B (impulsivity dimension) includes antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder.This cluster is characterized by impulsive behaviours. Cluster C (anxiety dimension) includes avoidant personality disorder, dependent per- sonality disorder and compulsive personality disorder. We are going to provide more information on borderline personality disorder (BPD) because this diagnosis is one of the most stigmatizing. People who are diagnosed with46Mental health problems BPD often have symptoms that make it difficult for them to avoid serious problems in the social world and to get effective help in mental health or social service settings. Borderline personality disorder The symptoms of BPD can occur in various combinations. People with the disorderhave many, if not all, of the following traits: fears of abandonment extreme mood swings difficulty in relationships unstable self-image difficulty managing emotions impulsive behavior self-injuring acts suicidal ideation transient psychotic episodes. Many of the characteristics of BPD reflect extreme ways that any person might react to a situation that upsets them. These reactions may be diagnosed as BPDwhen the person engages in severe self-destructive behaviour when he or she getsangry, or is disappointed, or experiences loss or grief and feels completely abandoned. 47Mental health problems Activity 3-1: Identifying mental health problems Read each of the following descriptions and write down whether mood, anxiety, psychosis or impulsivity describes the situation. More than one dimension mayapply. Tom, 50, and his wife, Laura, 47, have been married for 20 years. They both work full time\u2014Tom as an executive at an architectural firm and Laura as the managerof a large fitness club. They do not have any children, but enjoy the company andcompanionship of several other couples who have been very good friends for manyyears. Tom and Laura work hard at their jobs, but also spend a great deal of time together in the evenings and on weekends. About one year ago, Tom began to have difficulty falling asleep at night and therefore waking up in time for work. He alsodescribed feeling nervous and jittery, and found it hard to complete work-relatedtasks that used to be very easy for him. Laura became concerned when Tom began to withdraw from her and to spend increasing amounts of time watching television or simply sitting outside staring into space. Ever since the changes in his behaviourbegan, Laura also worried about Tom's drinking, which had gradually increased from an occasional glass of wine to several shots of whiskey four to five evenings every week. He was also unable to express his feelings or to explain why his behav-iour had changed so dramatically. One evening, when Laura and Tom were expectedat a friend's home for a dinner party, Laura found Tom sitting on the floor in thebedroom crying and shaking. He told her that he felt too nervous to go out andthat he \"couldn't stand feeling like this anymore.\" Benis a 20-year-old, single, second-year university student majoring in biochemistry and living in a student residence on campus. In spite of Ben's characteristically shyand quiet personality, he has developed a close friendship with his roommate, anoutgoing student from another province who goes by the nickname \"Scat.\" Ben haseven accompanied Scat to a few parties on campus and has been going to classeswith Scat and several other students from their residence. Ben's parents live in anearby city and are delighted that Ben, who was somewhat withdrawn and isolatedas a child and teenager, has made new friends. Halfway through the school year,however, Ben suddenly began withdrawing from his new group of friends and refusedto join them on outings. He started missing classes and instead stayed in his roomin the student residence. Within a few months, Ben stopped eating meals in thecafeteria, complaining that there was \"something in the food\" and that somebodywas trying to poison him. He became increasingly fearful that the other studentswere talking about him behind his back, and even accused Scat of plotting to harmhim. Eventually, he stopped going to his classes altogether and spent his entire dayin his room with the lights off, smoking cigarettes and marijuana, and listening toloud music. When Scat came home, Ben would angrily yell at him to get out. Scatreminded Ben that they lived in a non-smoking residence and Ben responded by 48Mental health problems throwing a chair at Ben and storming out of the room. When Ben did not come home for three days, Scat contacted his parents. They were shocked with Ben's beha- viour, especially his angry outbursts, smoking and use of drugs. Cassie is a 32-year-old single woman working part-time in a department store. She has become used to living on her own and supporting herself, especially since sheleft home at age 17 due to her parents' constant fighting and daily drinking. Cassiehas felt hopeless and despondent (dejected and sad) about her life for as long asshe can remember, and has endured long periods of feeling worthless, useless andlonely. Since the age of 15, Cassie has also experienced bouts of intense anger andurges to harm herself. Her family has been unable to cope with their own emotionsand have always turned to alcohol or gambling to deal with such unpleasant feel-ings as anger, boredom, sadness and anxiety. Cassie did not learn to deal effectivelywith her own feelings, and since the age of 17 has used various kinds of drugs tonumb her psychological pain. She has also found that cutting her arms and legswith sharp objects often helps to get rid of painful emotions quite effectively\u2014although the relief she gets from these self-harm behaviours never lasts very long.The intensity of Cassie's anger and loneliness has been increasing and she has begunto cope by overdosing on pills and then ends up in emergency departments. Duringone of her emergency admissions to a hospital she disclosed to a nurse that she iscontemplating suicide. Molly is a 35-year-old mother of four living in a subsidized housing complex in a Toronto suburb. Molly collects welfare in addition to financial aid for her children,aged seven years, five years, three years and nine months. Her ex-husband is in jail on a drug-related charge. Since her divorce one year ago, Molly has felt overwhelmed, particularly with f inding a job that will pay her enough so that she can support her children. She is also worried about finding appropriate child care services should she find a good job. With four children to care for, Molly has not had time to makefriends and she often feels an enormous sense of burden in addition to feeling \"downin the dumps,\" isolated and alone with her responsibilities. She has developeddaily episodes of severe nervousness and agitation during which she is completely unable to attend to her children's needs. She finds that as long as she paces around the same rooms in the same order and in the same direction and keeps repeatinga particular phrase, her nervousness mar ginally subsides. Often Molly finds that during these episodes she also experiences shaking hands, shortness of breath, anextremely fast heart rate and profuse sweating. When these symptoms becomereally bad, Molly takes excessive doses of minor tranquillizers such as Valium, pre-viously prescribed to her for insomnia by her family physician.49Mental health problems Comments Tom is experiencing problems with mood and anxiety . Ben appears to be suffer- ing from psychosis . Cassie appears to be struggling primarily with an impulsivity problem, accompanied by mood problems. Molly appears to be experiencing problems with anxiety and mood (depression). REFERENCES Skinner, W.J. (2005). Treating Concurrent Disorders: A Guide for Counsellors. Toronto: Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.Part II: The impact on families4 Outline Behaviour changes Relationship changes Increased responsibility Impact on caregiversHow concurrent disorders affectfamily life54How concurrent disorders affect family life When families learn that a relative has both a mental health disorder and a substance use disorder, they often feel shocked and scared. Mental health disorders on their owncan overwhelm families. Families who once had a safe and comfortable daily routinemay find themselves on an emotional roller coaster. There are many studies that document the stress families experi ence when they have a relative with a mental illness. However, few studies have looked at the added impact whenthat family member with mental illness also has substance abuse problems. One study byresearchers in the Un ited States sho wed what many of these families already know too well: that substance abuse contributes to family conflict and wears away social support (Kashneret al., 1991). Family members' lives often change dramatically after a family member develops con- current disorders. Many of these changes create stress. This chapter discusses: behaviour changes in the person with concurrent disorders relationship changes between family members increased responsibility for caregiving the impact on the caregivers. Before we discuss these experiences further, it's important to recognize that some positive changes can and do happen. While family members must acknowledge and cope with thechallenges they face, these challenges represent only one aspect of the caregiver experience.Many family members describe a renewed sense of closeness with their loved one and anappreciation for the truly important things in life, such as connecting emotionally withanother human being, having hope, overcoming extreme hardships and experiencing thejourney of recovery along with their loved one. Many family members find a positive wayto think about difficult circumstances\u2014for example, seeing caregiving in terms of hopeand personal growth, as an experience that has positively transformed them. BEHAVIOUR CHANGES Mental health problems can bring frightening changes in how people experience reality.These changes can affect their relationships and ability to function. Behaviour changesinclude paranoia and hallucinations, feelings of anger, drastic mood changes or over-whelming anxiety. People with mental health problems may: begin to lose trust in close family members find it hard to make even simple decisions, to complete plans or to set goals stop participating in activities that they once enjoyed cut themselves off from the outside world find it hard to express their feelings and thoughts retreat into their own inner world become hostile, even with their families. 55How concurrent disorders affect family life You have lots of your own feelings about it, and then lots of feelings for your loved one. How is this going to affect their life? What's going to hap-pen to them? There are so many things that just come pouring in. And youhave concerns for their siblings, for your other children . . . it can affect somany people. Substance use problems can interfere with a person's ability to follow family routines and meet their responsibilities. They may: spend more time getting and using substances, and less time or no time in their usualactivities have financial problems (the cost of using substances can become quite high; in somecases, substance use can lead to job loss, which can create further money problems) act out physically. RELATIONSHIP CHANGES The family member with concurrent disorders The person with concurrent disorders will often feel that family members are invading his or her personal life. Resentment about being overprotected may lead to anger, rebellionand acting out. These behaviours may increase the risk that the mental health problemswill worsen or that the person will end up in unsafe situations. The cycle of the family'spreoccupation and the loved one's reaction then repeats itself. This costs everyone interms of time, physical and emotional energy, and quality of life. Parents Parents of children with mental health disorders often feel a great sense of loss and sad-ness when they see the changes in their child. Family members may have to changetheir expectations for their loved one regarding education, career paths, marriage andchildren. This can involve emotional pain, a sense of loss, grief, sadness and anger. Thegrieving process is similar to the one experienced by those who have had a loved onedie, or who must adjust to a serious chronic physical illness in a loved one. The whole family\u2014we had so many other problems to face, you know? I remember feeling grief and frustration and a sense of tremendous loss, formy daughter and for her potential.56How concurrent disorders affect family life Siblings Siblings may worry about developing mental health problems, substance problems or both. They may worry about the stress and strain that their parents are enduring, andmay take on the burden of trying to make up for what their parents have lost in theirother child. At the same time, brothers or sisters sometimes resent the time that parentsspend with their sibling. They may become angry to the point of acting out or distancingthemselves from family and friends. I remember being teased as a child because I was so serious, so sombre\u2014 and people told me that I acted like a middle-aged woman, a lot older thanI actually was. It was impossible to explain to other people\u2014like, you go toschool after not sleeping all night, and after the police were at your housebecause of your sister's psychotic episode, and no one thought of dinner oranything like that because she overdosed and your parents had to go to theemergency room with her, and then you go to school the next day and it'slike, all the expectations are still on you. But you don't tell anybody any-thing, you just carry on as usual. You can't talk to anybody about it.Nobody will understand . . . . Siblings may also experience anger, hostility or verbal or physical aggression from their brother or sister. These behaviours can evoke shock, dismay, fear and a sense of aban-donment and rejection. Sometimes, children may feel like they have lost their bestfriend. They may feel guilty that they have a better life than their brother or sister. HELPING CHILDREN COPE Parents can help their other children by: assuring children that behaviours such as aggression are symptoms of the illness andshouldn't be taken personally sharing feelings and encouraging children to talk about how they feel and how theirbrother's or sister's problems are affecting them explaining that family members often feel uncomfortable, embarrassed or ashamed oftheir relative's behaviours, symptoms and diagnosis if appropriate, discussing the issue of stigma and why it happens, as well as effectiveways to deal with it (see Chapter 6 for more information about stigma) helping siblings learn about substance use and mental health problems and howthese interact with and affect each other spending time alone with siblings, talking and doing enjoyable activities helping children build a new relationship with their brother or sister and creatingunique ways of being with their sibling.57How concurrent disorders affect family life INCREASED RESPONSIBILITY Caring for basic needs Family members may begin to take on much more responsibility for their relative. In more severe cases, the relative may be unable to care for basic needs such as keepingup with personal hygiene, eating meals or even getting out of bed. If the caregiver isalso the family's only source of income, being unable to leave the family memberalone can lead to huge financial consequences for the family and more emotionalstrain for the caregiver. Our son not only has schizophrenia, but he uses drugs, he's been involved with gangs\u2014and with the police. Half the time we're not sure if he's takinghis medication\u2014he gets mad if we keep after him to do simple things, likehave a shower . . . we're so stressed as it is. We're trying to find out things,how we can resolve some of these problems. Sometimes I think I can't dealwith it all. People with concurrent disorders often have trouble maintaining stable and decent housing. They may: spend their money on substances rather than rent, which can lead to eviction become involved in criminal activity such as robbing, property theft, prostitution orthe sale of drugs to raise the large amounts of cash needed to buy the substances theyuse, which can result in loss of supportive housing and sometimes homelessness open their home to others involved in problem substance use, then be unable tomaintain that home, forget to feed and bathe themselves, pay heat and light bills, and face eviction. These consequences create even more challenges for the families. Co-ordinating treatment Some mental health programs refuse to treat people with concurrent disorders, or only treat the mental health problem. Similarly, some addiction treatment programs andfacilities may not address the mental health problem. Families may have to take respon-sibility for co-ordinating treatment between two or more service providers, as well ascaring for their relative. Having a loved one who is suffering from both a mental illness and a sub- stance use disorder can represent a significant disruption in the lives offamilies and can have an enormous impact on overall family functioningand sense of well-being.58How concurrent disorders affect family life People need to be able to call somebody when their loved one is in the hos- pital because of a mental illness or a drug problem. They need to be ableto touch base and get information from someone. It's hard for people whodon't know the system\u2014like, what channels have to be manoeuvred\u2014orwho to call when you have specific questions. There are so many roadblocks. Some suggestions for navigating the substance use and mental health system are dis- cussed in Chapter 7. IMPACT ON CAREGIVERS Family members may be concerned about leaving their relative alone because they areworried that he or she will take harmful drugs, forget to take medications, take part indangerous or criminal behaviour to get illegal drugs, or harm him- or herself during a serious episode of illness. If family members are constantly watching for symptomsand dealing with the impact of the illness, they may feel overwhelmed. You become extremely protective of [family members who are ill]. It takes incredible emotional energy. Some family members may find it almost impossible to soothe their own anxieties, and distract themselves from the strain of coping with their relative. They may feel unable oreven guilty to take time for themselves, to relax, care for their own emotional and physi-cal health, and rebuild their own coping resources. Sometimes, family members evenfeel guilty if they experience resentment or anger. They should admit if they are extremelytired, worn out, angry or bitter. Denying these emotions can lead to exhaustion, depres-sion, isolation and hopelessness. They may feel isolated from others who were once very good friends. They might feel that they don't have the time to maintain friendships, or they may be embarrassed orashamed about the concurrent disorders. Think about your own situation and how your life has been affected. Remember that all family members experience difficult circumstances and negative feelings. It is very com-mon for family members to feel guilty when they are asked to think about how this hasaffected their own lives. However, before you can begin to take care of yourself and playa positive role in your loved one's recovery, you need to think honestly about the differ-ent ways that your life has been changed. 59How concurrent disorders affect family life Caregiver burden and compassion fatigue: A note about language The term caregiver burden is used in professional literature to describe the emo- tional, social and psychological toll on the family that comes from caring forsomeone with a substance use and/or mental health problem. Many caregivers,while they like others to recognize how difficult it is to care for a family memberwith concurrent disorders, don't like the term \"caregiver burden.\" They feel itignores the positive side of looking after the needs of someone important to themand negates the fact that, in spite of the stress, they love the person and would goto the ends of the earth to help and protect them. It also dehumanizes their lovedone, and reduces him or her to a \"burden,\" which the caregiver hopes will notalways be the case. The stress and feelings of powerlessness that are such a large part of caring for a family member with concurrent disorders may be better described as compassion fatigue. We use compassion fatigue here to describe the overwhelming physical, emotional, social and spiritual exhaustion that can strike family members affectedby concurrent disorders. It is a much more user-friendly term for describing theresults of ongoing coping with extreme adversity. You can find some strategies for dealing with compassion fatigue at: www.mytherapynet.com/Public/ShowText.asp?EUID=&articleid=134&articletype=2560How concurrent disorders affect family life Activity 4-1: Personal impact log This log will help you think about the effects of your loved one's mental illness and substance use problems on your own physical, emotional, social and spiritualhealth.

PERSONAL IMPACT LOG Physical health Emotional health Social life Spiritual life62How concurrent disorders affect family life Activity 4-2: Preoccupation and impact It can be difficult to take even the smallest steps forward if you don't know the source of your worry, preoccupation and distress. This is an early version of a tool we are calling the family concurrent disorders Preoccupation and Impact Scale (PAIS). It'll help you think about how much having a family member with concurrent disorders is affecting your life; specifi-cally, how absorbed you are with thoughts, fears and worries about your familymember with these disorders. This scale still needs to be formally tested, so atthis point the intention (rather than interpreting your score) is simply to encour-age you to consider how much the preoccupation effect has infiltrated whichaspects of your life. Completing this quiz may help you realize that you havemoved beyond a constant state of preoccupation to an emotionally healthier,calmer, more balanced lifestyle.

You and your family membersshould never underestimate the benefits of taking care of yourselves. Taking good careof yourself gives you more physical and emotional energy to deal with the challengesyou face, and that will benefit your family member with the illness. Family memberswill each find their own way to care for themselves. Being able to soothe, relax andcalm yourself involves: knowing what kinds of thoughts and behaviours make you feel better or worse coming up with a self-care plan that helps you to prevent or overcome the negative feelings. This plan involves following a structured routine each day, engaging in a particular activity, spending time with a good friend, or focusing on a way of thinking\u2014anythingthat may comfort you and give you a sense of well-being and stability. We will develop a self-care plan later in this chapter. RESILIENCE The strongest oak of the forest is not the one that is protected from the stormand hidden from the sun. It is the one that stands in the open, where it iscompelled to struggle for its existence against the winds and rains and thescorching sun. \u2014Napoleon Hill (1883-1970) What is resilience? Resilience is frequently described as the capacity to thrive and fulfil one's potential despite (or perhaps because of) stressful circumstances. All of us are resilient in one way or another, but some people seem to be more so. They are inclined to see challenges as learning opportunities that can lead to healthy emotional growth and development. Factors that are characteristic of resilient people include: a sense of closeness and connectedness to others strong, dependable support from at least one significant other in their lives attention to their own personal health and well-being high self-esteem a strong sense of personal identity a realistic and balanced awareness of their strengths and limitations the ability to be assertive and emotionally tough when necessary, but also sensitive and compassionate69Self-care a playful, lighthearted approach to life a sense of direction and purpose in life the ability to turn difficult experiences into valuable learning opportunities the capacity to pick themselves up, shake themselves off and keep moving forward after traumatic and upsetting situations the ability to adapt to and live comfortably with uncertainty and unpredictability the ability to laugh at themselves. Resilient people do not \"sweat the small stuff.\" A sense of humor can help you overlook the unattractive, tolerate the unpleasant, cope with the unexpected and smile through the unbearable. \u2014Moshe Waldoks Developing resilience Ask yourself: How resilient am I? In what specific ways am I very resilient? In what ways am I less resilient and how can I change this? Activity 5-1: Assessing resilience Developed by Patricia Morgan To help you answer these questions, try filling out a resiliency questionnaire or quiz.

Quiz\" by N. Henderson(www.resiliency.com/htm/resiliencyquiz.htm)73Self-care SHORT-TERM SELF-CARE STRATEGIES Developing a plan of self-care involves thinking about ways to care for yourself on days when you might feel particularly stressed or worn down. Short-term goals focus on thefast and relatively easy ways that you can soothe yourself and replenish your energy. Wecall these strategies \"the quick wins.\" Putting the brakes on Family members identified these short-term strategies that helped them ease their anxietyfor a moment so they could face their situation with renewed energy: Have your morning coffee. Talk to someone you trust. Hug your pet. Take a deep breath. Take a timeout. Take a long, hot shower. Apply your favourite body lotion. Watch your favourite TV show. Sit in your backyard after dinner. Go for a long walk. Become more aware of nature. Go to a movie. Go shopping and treat yourself to something new. Give yourself permission to feel upset and frustrated, and permission to overcomethese feelings. Structure your day to ensure it includes leisure time. Think about things that make you feel happy or soothed or comforted and make a noteof them so you can remember to add those things to your list of self-care quick wins. These short-term strategies will be unique to each family member. List the quick wins that might be most helpful for you, and add to your list when something comes up thatyou find pleasant or re-energizing, such as visiting a flower market.74Self-care Strength and forgiveness Another self-care strategy involves recognizing and having appreciation for your own per- sonal strengths. This can take a great deal of practice. We can be very hard on ourselves. We can also start to focus on what we think we are doing wrong, instead of right, partic-ularly where it concerns family members who are ill. In fact, it can be much harder tosuffer the illness of someone you love than to suffer the illness yourself. It is essential to keep a sense of yourself as a person independent of your relationship to your relative with the illness. Acknowledging your strengths and giving yourself per- mission to be human may involve learning to think in new ways about your c ircumstances. For example, acknowledging positive aspects about yourself\u2014such as intelligence, a goodsense of humour, perseverance, motivation, physical abilities\u2014is particularly importantwhen you are stressed. You can practise this type of thinking every time you become overwhelmed with guilt or hopelessness. Positive self-talk One way to learn to think about your situation in new ways is by using self-talk. For example, tell yourself, \"I am doing the very best I can. I'm only human. I am a caringand loving mother.\" Letting yourself experience all of your feelings is extremely impor-tant when you are coping with difficult circumstances.75Self-care Activity 5-2: Quick wins Strengths One quick win involves recognizing your strengths. Think about five of your greatest strengths (e.g., the considerate things that you do for yourself or for other people,your sense of humour, your skill in a particular them below.1. __________________________________________________________________2. __________________________________________________________________3. __________________________________________________________________4. __________________________________________________________________5. __________________________________________________________________Role modelsAnother quick win can involve identifying role models. These could be other peo- ple who have overcome adversity and whom you admire because of the way theycan take care of themselves, both in calm periods and in crises. Think specificallyabout why you are choosing these particular people as role models, and identitythe characteristics that you appreciate in them. My role models are: ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________76Self-care Activity 5-3: Stop/start/continue Think about ways of behaving, feeling or thinking that you would like to: stop start continue. For example: I would like to stop feeling guilty that I am not doing more for my ill family member. I would like to start taking an afternoon time out just for myself, to go shopping or to do yoga or to visit with friends. I would like to continue going to a family self-help group such as the Mood Disorders Association of Ontario when this support group ends. Write down your wishes. Stop: _______________________________________________________________Start: _______________________________________________________________Continue: ___________________________________________________________77Self-care LONG-TERM SELF-CARE STRATEGIES Recognizing and addressing challenges There are many challenges in having a relative with concurrent disorders. Try to iden- tify and prioritize these challenges. You may decide that some cannot be dealt withquickly or easily. Others can be addressed immediately and even resolved. It can be difficult for family members when a loved one: refuses to take psychiatric medication feels severely depressed and suicidal lacks motivation and will not get out of bed doesn't think it's necessary to go to appointments and groups to solve problems uses alcohol or other drugs in your home doesn't see the alcohol or other drug use as a problem and, in fact, may tell you thatthose substances improve the symptoms of the mental health problem will not respond to your suggestions or offers for help becomes angry, verbally abusive or aggressive toward you and other family members. It can also be difficult when: you or another family member become physically ill and are unable to attend to your relative you feel overwhelmed, anxious or depressed yourself, and it begins to affect your abilityto care for your loved one you are afraid to leave your loved one at home alone, and yet you need to go to work another family member develops a mental health or substance problem (or both). Making a list of your options and possible solutions can help you develop an action plan. Some challenges may require help from other people, such as other familymembers, friends or health care professionals. You may decide to see a health profes-sional who can help you with your own needs and concerns. You may join a familysupport group after this one, or even while this one is running. You can make a listof especially close and supportive relatives and friends for help in a crisis. Maybe youcan hand over some responsibilities that can be carried out by others, so you canlighten your load in general (e.g., ask for help in car pools, have another family mem-ber shop for groceries, simplify the home cleaning schedule, teach everyone themiracle of the microwave!).78Self-care Sometimes you need to change the way you think about the problem. Perhaps you need to deal with it differently. For example, you might decide to set limits and clear bound-aries with your loved one, so that you do not feel helpless, angry and manipulated.Setting limits also helps your relative because your expectations for his or her behaviourare clearly stated (see Chapter 10: Limit-setting, p.163). Then you must always followthrough with the consequences, whatever you decide they will be. Feeling in control is an important part of a long-term self-care strategy. Understanding problematic thought patterns Trying to cope with emotions is challenging for many people at the best of times. Whenfaced with severe and persistent stress, you can find it even harder to deal with anger,grief, loneliness, sadness, shame and guilt. Remember that feelings are intertwined with thoughts, beliefs and behaviours. For example, if caregivers believe that they caused a family member's co-occurring mentalhealth and substance use problems, then they are more likely to feel responsible fortheir family member's relapses. Such beliefs may then lead to feelings of sadness, guiltand remorse. If caregivers are not able to cope with these emotions constructively, theycould avoid seeking help for their family members or for themselves. This may haveserious repercussions for their family members and for their own health and well-being.All the self-care morning coffees in the world will not help if you let problematic think-ing rule your thoughts. In Feeling Good, David Burns discusses how errors in thoughts and beliefs may lead to negative emotions. Awareness of the types of problematic thinking often helps caregiversto recognize these types of thinking in themselves. They are then in a better position towork on strategies for changing problematic thoughts and beliefs. OVERGENERALIZATION This is a common distortion in thinking that leads people to conclude that things areworse than they really are. It occurs when a person exaggerates and therefore inaccu-rately appraises an event or situation. For example, a family member may think, \"Ifailed to convince my daughter that she needs to take her medication, and she endedup being taken to emergency by the police. Since I failed to help her, that must meanI'm a failure as a person.\" Mental filter bias is a type of overgeneralization in which aperson focuses only on the negative aspects of an experience and downplays or ignoresthe positive aspects. 79Self-care MAGNIFICATION Magnification, or catastrophizing, occurs when a negative event is blown out of propor- tion. For example, the father of a teenage son with concurrent depression and alcoholabuse thinks \"Our neighbours looked at my wife and me in a funny way this morningand didn't even say hello. That must mean they think we're to blame for our son's ill-ness and they want nothing to do with us because they think we're bad parents.\" Thisbrief encounter is interpreted as something catastrophic. MINIMIZATION Minimization occurs when people downplay the meaning and importance of a positiveevent. \"It's great that I was hired for this job after almost 25 people applied for it. It paysmore than any job I've ever had before and my new boss said he is looking forward tohearing more about my ideas. I'll get to talk about these ideas in the executive boardroom meetings . . . but all I can think about now is the increase in taxes I'll have to paywith the higher salary and all the extra meetings I'll have to go to. Besides, I probablywon't last long anyway. Once my boss sees that I'm actually underqualified, I'll be firedand then I won't be able to pay any of my bills. And I really only got the job becausemy cousin worked here for years and put in a good word for me.\" DISQUALIFYING THE POSITIVE Disqualifying the positive occurs when people do pay attention to positive informationbut then later find a reason to discount it. \"It's great to have a friend like Barb call meall the time to talk, but she only calls me because her best friend got a new job now andis busy during the day. She really doesn't even like me.\" ALL-OR-NOTHING THINKING All-or-nothing, or black-and-white, thinking occurs when a person's evaluation of anexperience lies at one extreme or the other. For example, a person does not get a jobthat he or she really wanted. Instead of thinking, \"Up until now, I've been hired formost of the jobs that I've ever applied for, so if I keep looking, a great job is bound toturn up,\" the person thinks, \"I was just turned down for the best job I've ever appliedfor. I'll never have an opportunity like that again\u2014I'm a total failure.\" JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS This occurs when people jump to (usually negative) conclusions that are not justifiedby the facts that they have about the situation. \"It looks like this is going to be a goodday to relax and watch television, but I just know that the minute I sit down, anotherfamily crisis will start up.\" 80Self-care MIND READING Mind reading occurs when people assume, without any evidence, that someone is thinking something negative about them. They react based on this conclusion, whichis often false. \"Why should I bother trying to talk to my co-workers down the hall?They all hate me and think that I should be replaced by somebody who actuallyknows what they're doing.\" SHOULD, MUST AND OUGHT BELIEFS These thoughts and beliefs are often found in people who set unrealistic, often impossi-ble demands on themselves. When they fail to meet these demands, they either punishthemselves for their perceived failures or sink into low self-esteem and depression. \"Ishould be a better father\"; \"I ought to try harder to stop my husband from drinking\"; \"I should be better looking. I'll never get ahead in this life being this ugly!\" Some people with perfectionistic tendencies may also hold others to unrealistically high standards. \"My mother should learn a lot more about how to deal with my brother. Sheshould kick him out of the house if he refuses to take his medication and clean himselfup. And I can't understand why she doesn't demand that he go to a drug treatment cen- tre. She lets him just sit around the house thinking about whether or not he's ready toget help. If he were my son instead of my brother, I'd have him whipped into shape inno time. Nobody in this family can do anything right.\" PERSONALIZING AND BLAMING This happens when a person takes responsibility for something that in reality they hadvery little control over. \"I wasn't paying enough attention to my son. If I hadn't been sobusy working and doing other things, I would have known that he was planning to hurthimself and I could have stopped him. It's because of my negligence that he's back inthe hospital.\" Similarly, a person might unfairly assign responsibility to someone else. \"You would think my adult children would have noticed how stressed out I've been trying to takecare of their father and work and manage the whole household at the same time. Theycan be so selfish and self-centred. If they had been more helpful, I could have paidmore attention to my husband and he'd be off the drugs by now. It's really their faultthat the whole situation is so out of control.\" 81Self-care Dealing with difficult emotions Strategies that may help you to deal more effectively with difficult feelings include: repeating positive affirmations over and over to yourself such as, \"I am doing the best that I can and I am a good and decent person.\" being aware of yourself and any problematic thoughts you might be having about situations, events and other people that might be resulting in negative feelings being aware of how you handle stress and what kinds of stressful situations leave youfeeling most vulnerable developing effective ways of coping with a family member who has concurrent disor-ders (e.g., finding out how to navigate the treatment system and get help (see Chapter7, p. 107) setting limits and clear boundaries (see Chapter 10, p. 163) talking openly and honestly about how you feel, and examining those feelings, eitherwith someone you trust or within a peer or professionally led support group talking to other families about effective ways to deal with stress and difficult emotions developing and following your own personalized self-care plan. If you practise these strategies on a regular basis, you can cut down the frequency and intensity of distressing thoughts. They can help prevent negative moods from occurringin the first place, and also help prevent them from getting a lot worse. In order for many of these strategies to work, it is better if you are calm and thinking logically and rationally. In a stressful situation, if you find that you are already experi- encing intensely negative feelings, it might be better to first try calming and soothingyourself before you try to work on any problematic thoughts and beliefs. Building social support Family members often give up their own activities, and can become isolated fromtheir friends and colleagues when caring for a family member with concurrent disor-ders. Social support is crucial to help you achieve and maintain emotional and evenphysical health. FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES Some people find it helpful to have a large social network to draw on. Others prefer tohave only a few supportive and understanding friends. Participating in a group activityyou enjoy, such as a walking club, a sports team, a reading club or church group canhelp you retain your social network. Old friends and colleagues you've grown apartfrom may appreciate hearing from you. Being open about your situation will often bringsupport from the least likely places and people.82Self-care SELF-HELP ORGANIZATIONS Many family members join family self-help / mutual aid support organizations such as the Schizophrenia Society of Ontario (SSO), the Mood Disorders Association ofOntario (MDAO) or the Family Association for Mental Health Everywhere (FAME).While these groups provide support, education and advocacy for family members ofpeople with a mental illness, many of the participants have loved ones with both amental health problem anda substance use problem. Some of the groups are structured with educational programs or guest speakers from the mental health care system. Other groups are more informal and may involve small groupdiscussions and peer support from other family members struggling with similar issues.Some families also choose to attend self-help groups for family members of people withalcohol or other drug problems. These groups include Al-Anon (for family members ofpeople with alcohol problems), Alateen (for young adults who have siblings with sub-stance use problems) and Nar-Anon (for families of people with substance use problems).(See Tips for Evaluating Self-Help Groups, p. 132.) Becoming informed Information is power. Many family members seek both formal and informal opportuni-ties to learn about concurrent mental health and substance use problems. They find ithelpful to learn as much as they can about their loved one's particular mental health andsubstance use problems, including the causes, signs, symptoms and possible treatments. Believing in yourself and your rights You have a right to ask questions and to receive attention and respect from health careprofessionals. Some people with concurrent disorders want their family members to bevery involved in their treatment plan, even if they're in hospital. Others may prefer notto involve their families and may want to keep their personal information confidential.Whether or not you are actively involved in the professional care of your family mem-ber, you have a right to: your own support from health care professionals education about mental health and substance use problems information about the latest research and most effective treatment options respect and validation. (See Family involvement in Chapter 7, p. 115, and The role of family in chapter 11, p. 190.)83Self-care BUILDING A SELF-CARE PLAN Developing a self-care plan will help you think about the small steps you can take in your own life to build your resilience and reduce your vulnerability to compassion fatigue. Imagine what your self-care plan might look like. This plan should address all your needs: biological self-care (caring for your own physical health) psychological self-care (taking care of your emotional health) social self-care (taking care of your social needs and networks) spiritual self-care (drawing on sources of spiritual help that might comfort and guide you) financial self-care. This plan is called the biopsychosocial-spiritual self-care plan. Just remember to be very specific in your self-care plan. For example, a family member may choose to includesomething like the following in his or her plan: I will work out at the local gym three times a week for 30 minutes each time. I will walk reasonable distances instead of taking my car. I will go to Pilates classes with my friend Sheila once every week. I will eat three fruits a day, and take a B6 multivitamin. I will prepare two meatless dinners a week.84Self-care Activity 5-4: Self-care plan Think about how you can take care of your needs. See the following example of a self-care plan: Physical health Emotional health start daily walks again return to exercise classes (30 minuteslow impact at first; when ready, 45minutes of high impact & weights) park my car further away fromentrances and walk the remaining distance use stairs instead of escalators start shopping for healthy foods that Ienjoy and return to healthy eatinghabits.attend family support groups with myhusband to help us cope with Kevin'sillness resume my gardening set limits with Kevin (e.g., practisesaying no, allow him to make mis-takes) talk to my husband about stressesinstead of having a drink after work continue attending Al-Anon andMDAO family meetings set aside daily quiet time to read, garden or write in my journal. Social life Spiritual life go out for dinner with husband atleast once per week resume Friday \"euchre nights\" withour closest friends, Martha & Harry go out with my best friend, Sue, atleast once per week (shopping/lunch) resume \"family weekend outings\" onSundays.take classes on how to meditate increase awareness of nature (e.g.,birds & flowers during day, stars &solitude at night) return to my readings on Buddhism &serenity do my yoga sessions every morningwhen things are quieter around thehouse return to my daily meditation readings.BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL-SPIRITUAL SELF-CARE PLAN 85Self-care Now write down your ideas so you can take care of your needs. BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL-SPIRITUAL SELF-CARE PLAN Physical health Emotional health Social life Spiritual lifeIf one of the areas in your self-care plan looks sparse or empty, you may want to think about whether this is a component of your life that you should work towardexpanding. For example, if you have always been an energetic and active person,and in your personal impact log from Chapter 4 you wrote down that you are toobusy to exercise and that you feel down and tired all the time, this is an excellentarea to begin working on your own health and well-being.

In this study, family members expressed how deeply stigma hadaffected them on personal, interpersonal, social and political levels. Some family membershad learned to cope very effectively with the pain caused by stigma and discrimination,while others had never experienced stigma. However, most of the family members werenot only struggling with the fear of others finding out about their loved one's illness, butwere surprised and dismayed to find that they were sometimes blamed for the mentalhealth and/or substance use problems experienced by their loved ones. The quotesincluded in this chapter come directly from interviews with these family members.Their stories reveal the degree of pain experienced by so many families as a direct resultof prejudice, stigma and discrimination. Families usually experience stigma in four stages: Understanding stigma refers to the ways in which family members understand and explain stigma to themselves and others. Experiencing stigma refers to the ways that families experience the consequences of stigma. Surviving stigma refers to the strategies family members use to cope with stigma. Combating stigma refers to the decision by some families to fight stigma on a social and political level. This chapter will help you understand why stigma occurs and how families address these challenges. UNDERSTANDING STIGMA When I suspected I had cancer, I went for medical help right away. Then,for the first time in my life, I went through a real depression. It took threemonths before I would go to a psychiatrist's office\u2014and I knew I wasdepressed. I mean, I was responsible for the care of a very mentally ill per-son, my husband. I was afraid of being someone who had to go forpsychiatric help themselves. It meant that I was weak. I think the fact thatwe associate mental illness with some kind of weakness\u2014it's going to takea long time to get away from that. I mean, I was asking myself, \"Why am Idepressed? I should be coping better than this.\" 89Stigma Many societies look down on people with mental health or substance use disorders. They\u2014and their families\u2014face negative attitudes, behaviours and comments. This isknown as stigma. Stigma does more than make it more difficult to live with concurrentdisorders. Stigma can: shame, isolate and punish the people who need help reduce the chances that a person will get appropriate help reduce social support lead to lower self-confidence make people feel that they will never be accepted in society. Fear Many people are frightened of mental health and substance use problems. One of ourdeepest fears involves the loss of our abilities to think and communicate, to make ourown decisions and to set the course of our own lives. Many people believe that peoplewith mental health and substance use problems and their families may be strange,unpredictable, violent or dangerous. I think a common belief is that people with mental illness are violent\u2014you know how the media sometimes portrays people. And then you think, aremy relatives concerned that my daughter will be violent? And let's face it,she is often inappropriate and really angry when she's not well, but shenever gets violent with people . . . but a lot of people associate mental ill-ness with criminal behaviour in general. In fact, most people who are violent do not have mental illnesses. People who have mental illnesses are more likely to be the victims of violence\u2014about 2.5 times morelikely\u2014than other members of society. This violence often occurs among those peoplewho are also experiencing other factors such as poverty, homelessness and substanceuse. Unfortunately, recent research suggests that the public's perception that peoplewith mental illness are violent and dangerous is actually rising (Canadian MentalHealth Association, 2003). Family members worry about acknowledging their loved ones' concurrent disorders to friends and acquaintances, and fear rejection by those who know. A main concern isthat knowledge of the illness will reduce opportunities for their loved one. What comes to mind when I think of stigma? My immediate thought is fear of exposure. You know, fear of people's reactions. I mean, you're very fear-ful of a change in people's attitudes toward you or toward your familymember who's ill\u2014and whatever affects the consumer, affects the family.90Stigma Many people believe there is no hope for recovery or a future for someone with concur- rent disorders. Family members often compare concurrent disorders to cancer. In thepast, cancer was associated with stigma and avoidance, reactions that typically stemmedfrom fear. While cancer still arouses anxiety and fear, most people recognize that todaymany types are curable and others are treatable. Although concurrent disorders are simi-lar to cancer in that a life of meaningful recovery is possible, they are often not seenthat way. The media The media often misrepresent the link between mental health problems and violence,and present sensationalized, inaccurate and unflattering stereotypes of people with sub-stance use and mental health problems, as well as of their family members. Studies suggest that some types of discrimination have actually increased in the past 10 years, partly because of media coverage linking mental health disorders with violentmurders (Canadian Mental Health Association, 2003). Media portrayals of mental ill-ness emphasize its chronic nature, violence and criminal behaviour, while portrayals ofsubstance use disorders emphasize poor self-control and hopelessness. Such misleadingportrayals increase rejection, ostracism, harassment and victimization of people withmental illness, substance use disorders and concurrent disorders. Inappropriate or care-less use of stigmatizing language is also common in the media. I think the media is smartening up a little bit, but you still hear stuff all the time. I just heard someone on the news the other day say, \"Oh, you'dhave to be schizo to do that.\" Language is . Themedia . . . have responsible. And we have to make them accountable.I think it's really important to make people be responsible for what they sayand for the messages they put out about other human beings. The average North American household watches almost five hours of television per day (Nielsen Media Research, 2007). Many viewers don't question the negative images andinformation that they see. On a more positive note, the number of documentaries and movies with realistic and sensitive messages is increasing. At least there's more and more accurate information on television about mental illness, about schizophrenia and substance abuse, that at least portrays thesepeople as people, shows their humanity, and the tragedy of their loss.91Stigma Blame Several years ago, the prevailing explanation for concurrent disorders blamed families for causing and prolonging these disorders. Many parents in the study recalled hearingthis from both health care professionals and society in general. I compare mental illness and addiction to Alzheimer's disease because my mother-in-law felt comfortable calling up all her relatives and letting usknow that her husband had Alzheimer's. No doctor blamed her. The com-munity offered all kinds of support and I think that's because they hadknown him to be a valid member of society, as a hard-working, neighbourlyperson for 75 years. And as people get older, we expect some mental degen-eration, right? Whereas with mental illness . . . my mother was partially blamed for my sister's schizophrenia so she started hiding it from people. Usually a person with a physical illness is not expected to take on normal responsibilities or to get well purely by an act of will. When the problem is seen as resulting from per-sonal choice, social expectations are often harsher. For the longest time, I understood intellectually what the disease [schizophrenia and problem substance use] was\u2014but deep down I thoughtit was my sister's fault, and if she really tried, she could have more self-con-trol and could act better. But there comes a point when that way of thinkingdisappears, and you realize that people with mental illness didn't ask for this. This has to be the most horrible thing\u2014to lose control of your own thoughts. EXPERIENCING STIGMA Stigma by association Some say that stigma is worse than the disease itself. \u2014Torrey (1994) We have seen that a combination of biochemical changes in the brain and a wide range of environmental factors can trigger substance use and mental health problems. Yet manypeople still believe these problems are caused by the behaviours of family members. Families may be blamed, feared or shunned because of their connection with their relative. Although many parents are reassured when they discover that there are bio-medical components to mental health disorders, they continue to feel blamed by92Stigma society for their relative's problems. Whether families actually experience discrimina- tion or negative attitudes, or fear that they might, the experience can be stressful.Because of the fear of stigma, people tend to hide the diagnosis. They may start avoid-ing others and live in fear that the illness will be discovered. Family members experience the effects of stigma in many ways: Their social support network may shrink and they may face negative attitudes if they reveal the disorder. They may be disappointed by reactions from mental health care professionals and feelalienated from the treatment process. They often have to endure the effects of labelling and the visibility of the disorders. They may delay getting treatment due to fears of stigma. As kids, we knew there was something wrong with my mother, but there was never any validation from anyone else about that. We couldn't really tellanybody or go to anybody for help. People that weren't really connected tothe family couldn't see what was going on, and so it was just this constantsort of day-in and day-out bizarre inner world that we lived in, that nobodyelse could really see\u2014and we were alone with it. Multiple sources of stigma Multiple sources of stigma increase the risk of mental, emotional and physical healthproblems. The more visible a person's differences\u2014for example, physical disability,noticeable developmental delay, non-white skin colour, unconventional dress, lowEnglish-language proficiency and accents\u2014the less comfortable they are about access-ing mental health care. Isolation Many people try to protect themselves from stigma by avoiding certain people or situa-tions. However, limiting social interactions can increase loneliness and psychologicaldistress and lead to social isolation. As a result, people may start to think that they areincompetent, strange or otherwise flawed. A reduced social support network may actu- ally lower family members' self-confidence and self-esteem, and they may experiencedepression. In such cases, people are less likely to seek help. I guess this has something to do with stigma\u2014that you close out people that you could have counted on\u2014people that you really need. And you endup closing them out only because of the stigma\u2014not because you don'ttrust them or anything, it's just the stigma. And the risk is huge, so you'reclosing all the doors. You close the doors to any support link. 93Stigma Lack of acknowledgment Families say that health care professionals rarely recognize family members' strengths, value their opinions or acknowledge their efforts to support their loved ones. Familyneeds are often not considered a priority, and integrated care for mental illness andsubstance use disorders is not widely available. Family members recount being ignored,patronized and blamed for their loved one's illness. They may feel that they are notbeing consulted about their relative's treatment. I have felt resentful for all the years I put in before the illness was diagnosed. How much time and how much agony, and how much worry\u2014because thiswas a child who was not developing normally, and nobody listened to me!I was so angry over that\u2014and I'm still angry. CULTURALLY SENSITIVE TREATMENT Treatment programs based on western philosophical values and assumptions may notbe helpful for everyone. Family members comment on the lack of culturally sensitivemental health care services and the lack of families from various minority groups insupport groups. People have an opportunity to learn ways of handling problems like stigma, but only if you can actually get people to go to support groups\u2014becausethat's the other thing\u2014my parents aren't the kind of people to go to thesegroups. . . . And most of the people in these organizations tend to be Anglo-Saxon, female and mothers of mentally ill people. They're more educated,the kind of people who are likely to do volunteer work, join committees andorganizations, and to help counsel others, whereas the average person fromsome cultures seems to prefer to keep it within the family\u2014to hide the men-tal illness and the drug problem. They not only have to deal with mentalillness\u2014they belong to other ethnic backgrounds, and they may be stigma-tized because of that. Labelling Some families are reluctant to accept a formal diagnosis because of the potentially dev-astating effects of labelling. \"Schizophrenic\" and \"drug abuser\" are among the mostpowerful labels. diagnoses such \"depression and tranquillizer abuse\" and \"anxietydisorder with codeine abuse\" can be interpreted as meaning that the person is not ableto handle everyday stress. Health professionals may not take the symptoms of these dis-orders seriously and sometimes see these clients and families as \"personality disordered\"or \"attention-seeking.\" 94Stigma A formal diagnosis can be far more difficult to ignore or hide than informal labels. A family member talked about having difficulty in accepting her brother's diagnosisof schizophrenia, preferring instead to believe that his bizarre and unpredictablebehaviour was caused only by drug abuse. Others may struggle to accept the reality of the diagnosis. It really wasn't until he had a full-fledged psychotic episode that we knew it was more than just the drugs. It was different when the diagnosis becameone of drug abuse andmental illness. It was really difficult. It was difficult to accept that schizophrenia was a real diagnosis also\u2014it was difficult justto, sort of, rid myself of the feeling that, no, it can't be mental illness. Itcan't be schizophrenia. I mean, it was that word\u2014just the word, the labelitself\u2014that, well, I thought, \"That can't be right. It's got to be just, youknow, hits of acid,\" or whatever. It sounds terrible, but that's what I thoughtthen. So yeah, it was hard to accept, for sure. When the symptoms are more obvious (e.g., excessive substance use, angry outbursts, talking to oneself), the stigma is usually greater. There is more stigma, I think, when mental illness is more obvious. People can see it. My daughter told me that she smashed a bottle on the groundtwo weeks ago. She was walking along, she had a juice bottle, and she justgot angry\u2014she was very unstable at that time . . . people do get frightened. Delayed treatment When a person receives prompt treatment for concurrent disorders, the course of the ill-nesses may be changed for the better with greater hopes for recovery. But fear of stigmacan discourage families from seeking care for their loved one as well as care and supportfor themselves. Stigma can make parents hesitate to go for more help. But who can blame them? It only takes one really bad experience in the health care system andyou don't want to go through anything like that again. When my husbandand I took our son to a child psychiatrist, he blamed the behaviour on ourparenting. Now, that sort of thing, being blamed, being told you have badparenting skills, prevents many people from seeking needed treatment later.People think, well, there's no use going to those guys for help, they're onlygoing to tell us it's our fault! We went away and never came back. We alljust lived with it. A family member describes the distress she has endured for a number of months over her son's concurrent disorders and his refusal to seek help due to fears of people's negative attitudes. 95Stigma You know, if you have cancer surgery and you have to take a month off school for that, do you think it would jeopardize somebody's chances ofcompleting their degree? And as his mother, I tobat violate my son's privacy and confidentiality. So he'sdelayed going for help because of what might happen to his job! So, Imean, tell me who would explain it to his supervisor? Give me oneperson that would do that for him! One person who would say, \"Okay, let's reallyhelp this guy. Let's go to bat for this kid.\" SURVIVING STIGMA Family members have found many ways to cope with stigma and discrimination. Strategieschange, depending on the situation, their relative's stage of illness or recovery, and theirown stage of self-discovery and healing. Strategies to survive stigma are unique to eachfamily and its members: turning to other families in similar situations for support keeping the problems private \u2014 as a family matter sharing their stories with the public challenging negative attitudes looking at the situation from a different perspective. Building support networks Many families turn to community-based services such as the Mood Disorders Associationof Ontario, the Schizophrenia Society and Al-Anon for emotional support, informationand acceptance. Social support can help families deal with problems and cope withstress, and can even prevent or reduce various health problems. How many people even know that family support is an avenue to help them cope with things like stigma? I mean, people just don't know. But it's very important for family members to get help. Let me put it this way\u2014if I didn'thave the help along the way, my husband and I wouldn't be married, because I wouldn't have been able to cope with his mental illness and alco-holism. Where would society be without help available? Family support groups also provide the opportunity to develop friendships and social networks that can help build self-esteem and feelings of efficacy. When family members are in touch with others with the same problems, feelings and experiences, they areless likely to blame themselves for their relative's problems. 96Stigma Family support groups can be a very big help to people who can actually talk about it. There's a list of possible topics like medication, noncompli-ance, housing and stigma\u2014topics that in a typical social gathering, they'rea real downer\u2014I mean, to start talking about psychiatric medications, non-profit housing, what drugs do to people with mental illness, and all the restof it! So it's a relief just to be in a group of people that you know under-stand, and you don't have to explain your situation to them. You don't haveto hide it. Everybody's pretty much tackling the same thing. Families also say that providing support and information to others promotes a sense of success and self-esteem. I've advocated for a buddy system. I think each new family should be linked with a more experienced family, to help them through the maze of all this.Many new families come to the support groups because they feel so alone.It's good for the more experienced family, too. They feel good becausethey're helping someone. It makes them feel like they can do something,make a difference. Maintaining privacy Many family members are uncertain whether or not to tell others about the mental illnessand substance abuse. A related issue is the decision about when, how and whom to tell. When you have severe mental illness and drug problems in the family, everytime you meet a new person you have to wonder, \"Should I tell them?Should I not tell them? What will happen? What will they think if I do tellthem? How will they deal with it?\" The onus is on you to worry about it\u2014you have to expend the energy. If their relative agrees, some families choose to tell their personal story in a public forum. In this environment, family members are often able to be more objective abouttheir experiences. Because the purpose is to educate others, family members say thatthey have greater control over the emotional aspects and others' reactions. However, to avoid stigma, some people try to keep the problems a secret or avoid others. There are some days when I drive to my parents' house, and if one of the neighbours comes out of their house, I just keep driving around the blockuntil I know they're gone, because I just can't deal with it\u2014the looks andthe questions, that whole reaction you get\u2014so I stay away from it if I can.And I can't force myself to say \"hello\" just like a normal person because I'mwondering what happened the day before\u2014what did my sister do this timein front of the neighbours? Depending on the situation and how I feel, Ihandle it in different ways. 97Stigma Hiding the problems works only as long as the condition remains invisible or the family member with concurrent disorders is able or willing to help cover things up. If the con-dition becomes more obvious, it may be necessary to try new strategies. For instance,one woman's husband had major depression and a serious drinking problem, which hadled to hospitalizations, many treatments and job loss. After a long period of stability, heexperienced a relapse of depression and spent days watching television or lying in bed.His wife told friends that he had worked so hard he needed to slow down. People weresympathetic and didn't question his absences from social events or work. Some families try to maintain separate public and private identities. Only close, under- standing friends or family are trusted with the truth and are allowed to see all aspects ofwhat some family members called their \"real\" identities. I would never tell any of my co-workers. Never. Because it would hurt me professionally\u2014that's a fact. It's a spillover stigma. So at work, I have a sep-arate circle of friends\u2014and it's like a haven. It's the one place I can go thathasn't been touched by schizophrenia and depression and drugs and alco-hol. If I were to tell [co-workers], then mental illness would take over thatworld as well. So, it's better to just have that barrier there between the twoworlds, and then there's a threshold I can step over\u2014to get over to this nor-mal world. It's a refuge and a place of rest. Although many family members say that they avoid potential stigma by not disclosing the problems, research has shown that some of these strategies have negative conse-quences. The question is whether it is actually possible to reduce the effects of stigmaby keeping information secret. One study showed that elaborate coping mechanisms involving secrecy did not reduce the negative consequences associated with stigma,prejudice and discrimination. Such strategies also did not prevent psychological dis- tress and demoralization. In fact, the tactics that led to avoidance and withdrawalproduced more harm than good (Link, Mirotznik, Cullen, 1991). Challenging negative attitudes Strategies such as dismissing, downplaying or challenging negative attitudes and beliefs can help to enhance self-esteem and resilience. For many family members, accepting the idea that they can't control other people's attitudes, beliefs andbehaviour is liberating. You can't let negative people get to you. You just have to put on a suit of armour and face it. Stigma is everywhere\u2014running away won't make it anybetter, for you or for your family. You have to be tough with things like this. . . . I don't experience stigma at all. I refuse to. If people have bad attitudes toward my husband's depression, I try to educate them. If they won't hearwhat I have to say, forget them. I don't waste time on people like that. 98Stigma The section below entitled \"Combating Stigma\" has more information on challenging negative attitudes. Changing the perspective Another coping strategy involves thinking positively about difficult circumstances. Itmay involve seeing caregiving in terms of hope and personal growth, as a journey thathas transformed them in a positive way. Any really bad experience in life has the potential for learning, and I think that as a human being, that's what you have to try to do. I mean, you can'tapproach it intentionally like that, but now I can think to myself, \"Yes, thisreally was a learning experience.\" A related strategy is to try to loosen the hold that stigma may have on you.I think stigma is how a person perceives it and I think if you refuse to let stigma be there, it loses its hold over you. You can't be ashamed. Becausethere is no shame in this. You start to wonder about yourself\u2014and that'swhat stigma can do, make you wonder about yourself. COMBATING STIGMA When some families discover that a big part of stigma and rejection is social, not per-sonal, it stimulates them to try and make changes. For years now, I've fought for the rights of those with concurrent mental illness and substance abuse problems, to really legitimize the wholething. We have to start coming out of the closet. I think we'll have a muchstronger position when everybody can finally relate to the reality of con-current disorders. Family members may become involved in social and political action to change condi- tions and attitudes, to decrease discrimination and increase control over resources.Family support groups are at the heart of this action. Such groups give people a sense of collective power to solve their common problems and improve their lives. 99Stigma Advocating for change Stigma has powerful effects that people can't easily overcome on their own. Stigma can prevent legislators from setting aside enough money for mental health care and financial support for caregivers; it can keep insurance companies from providing enough coverage. For many family members, educating the public about the myths, stereotypes and reali-ties of concurrent disorders helps reduce stigma. Families have worked hard to decreaseirrational fears while attempting to humanize and promote acceptance of both the peo-ple with these disorders and their families. Family members have recognized that healthcare workers, educators and the media need to be educated as well. Things will improve, and we're doing our bit out there with education about mental illness and substance abuse. Things really couldn't be much worsethan they were 20 years ago. There's a lot of education and good researchcoming out now. I still feel that education is the best way to combat stigma,but I think it can take a couple of generations to get rid of things like that\u2014so we're only halfway there, if that. Family groups are one of the best catalysts for change across the mental health and addiction services system. Members of family self-help support groups can: argue for better treatment, planning and accountability sponsor conferences speak at professional meetings lobby legislators and appointed officials. The family movement, particularly in the United States, has significantly influenced research and treatment for people with concurrent disorders. Family members havedeveloped effective relationships with researchers, mental health professionals, legislatorsand administrators, without compromising their own independence as advocates. Stigma is nothing like it used to be, say, 18 years ago. It's really gone down, and the reason, I think, is that people are better informed. I like to thinkthat the strongest advocates for concurrent disorders are primarily familymembers. We were the ones that started talking about it, not hushing upthe \"S\" [schizophrenia] word that has demystified mentalillness and substance abuse a lot. It helped with my friends. Quite early on,the friends that I had were not terribly sympathetic. I set about educatingthem, frankly. Advocacy activities can pose a moral dilemma for some families. They need to be sensi- tive to their relative's desire for privacy or disillusionment with the mental health system.Some may wish to forget or deny their condition and expect their families and others toco-operate. Many families encourage caution in moving forward with lobbying or otherpublic advocacy activities. 100Stigma ADVOCACY TIPS 1. Be well informed. As a family member or friend of a person living with substance use and mentalhealth problems, you already know the effects of this illness. Your experience andknowledge is one of the greatest tools you can bring to your advocacy efforts. 2. Identify your issues. You may have many areas of concern (i.e., access to comprehensive mental healthand substance use screening and assessment, access to integrated treatment), but it is best to keep your communication targeted. Focus on one or two issues at a time. 3. Communicate effectively with government officials. Connect with officials, either in person or by phone, to expand relationships andpresent your key messages. You can call your local member of Parliament (MP) andreview your key issues. If you are able to speak directly with your MP, be specific,persuasive and factual. Keep your conversation short. Ensure you thank the officialfor his or her time. Finally, follow up with a brief letter reinforcing your key mes-sages. If you cannot speak directly with your MP, leave a message with his or herassistant. Be sure you know what you want to say, say it politely and don't forget toleave your name, address and phone number. Send a letter to a federal government ministry such as Health Canada or Justice Canada. Letters, either through Canada Post or e-mail, are powerful ways to get keymessages to MPs. When writing a letter, remember to use the correct address, useyour own words and personal experiences, identify the issues and key messages anddon't forget to say thank you. Letters are a great way for politicians to get to know thereal faces of people affected by mental health and substance use problems. You arecritical to making this happen. Here are some suggestions for preparing to communicate with government officials: If you want to contact provincial or territorial government officials, visit http://canada.gc.ca/othergov/prov_e.html for more information on contacting yourmember of provincial or territorial parliament. Find your federal MP by entering your postal code at: www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/house/PostalCode.asp?lang=E&source=sm. You can find out about the federal ministries and the ministers responsible for eachministry at www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/related/Federal/Agency.asp?Language=E&Agency=M. Further contact information is available atwww.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/key/Ministry.asp?lang=E. For more information on how to communicate with your MP, visit www.vsr-trsb.net/publications/roundeng.pdf. 101Stigma 4. Communicate effectively with the media. Your local newspaper, television or radio station may be willing to write an articleabout your experiences and key issues. Be clear and concise when speaking to themedia. Be prepared when you speak to a journalist and remember to stick to your key messages. You may also want to contact local, provincial, territoria l or national organizations for more information before speaking with the media. Tip list adapted with permission from Advocacy Tips (Schizophrenia Society of Canada) The impact of anti-stigma campaigns Some studies have shown that educational campaigns result in a moderate increase ingeneral knowledge about mental illness and substance abuse, but they actually have lit-tle impact on negative attitudes. For example, educating people about the biochemicalnature of concurrent disorders hasn't improved attitudes toward people with mentalhealth and substance use problems (Read & Harre, 2001). However, attitudes did improve when people had personal contact with people who have concurrent disorders. This suggests that educational and anti-stigma campaigns shouldhave a personal element, perhaps with client and family testimonials about their strug-gles and triumphs. I think the strongest advocates against stigma are family members and the people with the illness themselves. We are now getting people that are will-ing to stand up and say, yes, I have schizophrenia and, yes, I have useddrugs and alcohol. I know three or four people that will actually come withme to high schools and get up and talk about their illness in front of highschool students. And I took one young man with me to speak to the first-year medical students last month. That's the kind of thing that people willlisten to\u2014the real stories coming from the people themselves.102Stigma Take a look at the following list of well-known public figures who have personally dealt with a mental health problem, a substance use problem or both. Were you aware that these famous individuals (and this list provides only a few examples!) have struggled or continue to struggle with such problems? Do any of these names come as a surprise to you? If so, why do you think you are so surprised? Paula Abdul (singer/dancer) had an eating disorder (bulimia nervosa). Patty Duke Astin (actress) wrote about her bipolar disorder in a book entitled A Brilliant Madness: Living with Manic-Depressive Illness. Drew Barrymore (actress) has tackled clinical depression and substance use problems from a very young age. Ludwig van Beethoven (German composer) had bipolar disorder. Jim Carrey (comedian/actor) has experienced clinical depression. Winston Churchill (former British prime minister) had bipolar disorder. Francis Ford Coppola (director, The Godfather and Apocalypse Now ) had bipolar disorder. Patricia Cornwell (mystery/thriller writer) had bipolar disorder and eating disor- ders (anorexia and bulimia nervosa). Charles Darwin (naturalist, author of \"The Origin of Species\" theory of evolu- tion) had severe panic disorder. Carrie Fisher (actress\u2014Princess Leia in Star Wars ) had bipolar disorder and sub- stance use problems. F. Scott Fitzgerald (writer, The Great Gatsby ) experienced clinical depression. Judy Garland (actress, singer, \"Dorothy\" in the Wizard of Oz ) had clinical depres- sion and substance use problems. Linda Hamilton (actress, Terminator , Terminator II ) has bipolar disorder. Sir Anthony Hopkins (British actor, Nixon and The Silence of the Lambs ) had clini- cal depression. Margot Kidder (actress, \"Lois Lane\" in Superman ) had bipolar disorder. Marilyn Monroe (actress) had clinical depression and substance use problems. Alanis Morissette (singer, musician) has experienced clinical depression. Dolly Parton (country singer, actress) had clinical depression. George S. Patton (US general, WWII military leader) experienced clinical depression. Cole Porter (American lyricist, composer of Broadway scores [\"Anything Goes,\" \"Can-Can,\" \"Night and Day\"]) experienced clinical depression, alcoholism,paranoid delusions and obsessive-compulsive disorder. James Taylor (musician, singer) had bipolar disorder. Leo Tolstoy (writer, War and Peace ) experienced clinical depression and alcoholism.103Stigma Barbra Streisand (singer, actress) has social phobia. Margaret Trudeau Kemper (wife of former Canadian prime minister, Pierre Trudeau) has bipolar disorder. Robin Williams (actor) has bipolar disorder. Burnout When years of advocacy fail to produce desired results, family members may feel disem- powered and burned out. You know, there's a \"Cure for Cancer\" run\u2014everybody goes to bat for peo- ple stricken with cancer. And . . . there are people who go door to doorraising money for cancer research and cancer support . . . but compare thisto schizophrenia\u2014people will for Schizophrenia,\" butthey're not exactly supportive. They're not rooting or cheering them on oranything. But then again, with mental illness and substance abuse, it'sgoing to be so much harder. Relatively few people with concurrent disordersor their families have come out in the open, if you consider the percentageof people with these illnesses. We just don't see enough role models andheroes. What we do see are the dedicated family members who have reallymade a push forward in this area. Issues such as lack of housing for relatives with concurrent disorders, lack of acknowl- edgment of the burden on the family and failure to provide services and respite carefor families are consistently raised and ignored. In spite of these barriers, however, family members continue to strive for equality, fairness and justice. Families may needto take a break from advocacy work from time to time to give themselves a chance forrest and renewal. Despite their negative experiences, family members have found ways to survive and cope with stigma. Many have reflected on their own growth and development as theyfaced stigmatization and have come to see their experience as a process in which theylearned to rise above the effects of prejudice and discrimination.

IS THERE A SYSTEM? While there are many substance use and mental health resources and services avail-able, what are m issing are the threads that would join these resources and services together. If those threads were in place, roles and tasks would be clearly understood, client-centred planning started, and services across programs easily accessed. Connectingservices is even more of a concern when clients have complex problems, which is usuallythe case with concurrent substance use and mental health problems. Though providerswill acknowledge that a client has many needs, too often, they aren't willing or able tosay, \"You've come to the right place, and we are the right people to work with you. Ifwe can't meet all of your needs, we have access to other resources that can.\" WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN: INTEGRATED TREATMENT Treatment for concurrent disorders works best if the client has a stable, trusting, long-term relationship with one health care professional\u2014for example, a case manager or therapist. Integrated treatment means that treatment for substance use and mental health problems are combined and ideally provided in the same treatment setting by the same cliniciansand support workers, or same team of clinicians and support workers. This ensures thata client receives a consistent explanation of substance use and mental health problemsand a coherent treatment plan. Integrated treatment means that the client gets co-ordi-nated and comprehensive treatment, as well as help in other life areas, such as housing109Navigating the treatment system and employment. Ongoing support in these life areas helps clients to maintain treat- ment successes, prevent relapses and meet their basic life needs. Most integrated programs have been developed for clients who have severe mental health problems. They have common features including: staged interventions (see \"States of change\" and \"Stages of treatment\" on p. 121-122) assertive outreach (see \"Assertive community treatment,\" p. 133-134) motivational interventions (see \"Motivational approaches to treatment,\" p. 119-121) social support interventions (e.g., housing and employment support). If integrated care always required that clients be served in a single program, current service systems would have to be completely rebuilt. Fortunately, substance use andmental health service providers are discovering that many people with concurrent dis-orders can receive well-integrated care from different programs, if: links are established among programs one person or team takes overall responsibility for ensuring that services are co-ordinated. Many substance use and mental health service providers have developed collabora- tive relationships that allow them to offer integrated approaches to treating con-current disorders. People with severe mental illness and substance use problems usually respond better when both problems are treated at the same time. However, people with other types of mental health problems may respond better when substance use and mental healthproblems are treated in sequence (e.g., anxiety problems often improve when sub-stance use is reduced or stopped). In this example, substance use problems are usuallyaddressed first, but within the context of a treatment plan that considers both mentalhealth and substance use problems (Health Canada, 2002). WHAT MAY HAPPEN: SEQUENTIAL OR PARALLEL TREATMENT In many communities, treatments for substance use and mental health problems are still offered in isolation from one another. This may occur in one of two ways: treatment for one problem is only available after the other problem has stabilized (sequential treatment) both problems are treated at the same time, but there is little, if any, communication between the mental health and substance use service providers (parallel treatment).110Navigating the treatment system Sequential treatment In sequential treatment, a client with concurrent disorders is not eligible for treatment in one part of the system (e.g., in the mental health care system) until the other prob-lem (e.g., alcohol or other drug use) is resolved or stabilized. Drawbacks of sequential treatment include the following: The untreated problem continues to affect the problem that is being treated. Substance use and mental health providers may not agree about which problem (mental health or substance use) should be treated first. It is unclear when one problem has been \"successfully treated\" so that treatment of the other problem can begin. Often the client is not referred for treatment of the other problem. Parallel treatment In parallel treatment, mental health and substance use disorders are treated at the sametime, but by different professionals or teams (often working for different agencies, butsometimes within the same agency). Drawbacks of parallel treatment include the following: Mental health and substance use treatments are often not integrated into a cohesive treatment package. For example: -Many addiction services agree that reducing or even monitoring substance use is a realistic goal for clients at the beginning of treatment. However, some mentalhealth programs ask clients to stop alluse of alcohol or other drugs before they can begin treatment. -Many mental health problems benefit from treatment with medications. However,some substance use programs may want the client to stop taking all drugs, includingthose used to treat mental health problems. Treatment providers may not talk with each other. The job of pulling the substance use treatment plan and the mental health treatment plan together may fall on the client and his or her family. Clients may not meet eligibility criteria when trying to access one system or the other. This could mean the client receive no services at all. ACCESS POINTS Finding a program that is a good fit for your relative can be a challenge for several reasons: Many communities have no specialized, integrated concurrent disorders services to assess and treat complex cases. In some communities, the waiting lists for specialized services are too long. 111Navigating the treatment system Substance use and mental health programs and services may have admission criteria that exclude clients with concurrent disorders. Finding psychiatrists or clinical psychologists who can provide psychiatric diagnoses can be a challenge in many communities. Treatment resources may be lacking, even though you, your relative or your doctor understand what would be most helpful. But you have to start somewhere, so we begin by talking about the most common entry points into the system. Family doctors and psychiatrists Family doctors, or general practitioners (GPs), are often the first professionals that peo-ple talk to about a mental health problem. Doctors can examine your relative's physicalhealth and rule out problems that could be adding to or affecting changes in his or hermood, thinking or behaviour. Sometimes doctors can do a full psychiatric assessment,particularly for the more common conditions, such as depression or anxiety. Sometimes,doctors will suggest that a person see a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists almost always need a referral from a doctor before they can see a client. Family doctors often have a list of psychiatrists they can refer a person to. After bookingan appointment, a person often has to wait at least two to three months to see a psychia-trist. If you and/or your relative don't agree with the diagnosis, your relative should ask the family doctor for a referral to another psychiatrist for a second opinion. Most doctors are open to clients seeking another perspective and may even suggest it. Community mental health agencies Community agencies can also offer assessments. The type of assessment will depend onthe health care provider available. Sometimes this may be a doctor, psychologist, socialworker or nurse. In smaller cities and rural areas, you are more likely to be seen by acommunity mental health worker. This person will try to match your needs with theservices available. Substance use agencies Most substance use agencies accept self-referrals. After an initial assessment, the personwill be referred to the level of care (e.g., community-based treatment, residential treat-ment, withdrawal management) that meets his or her needs at that time. Screening for mental health problems should be part of the assessment process, and referral to a mental health treatment program or a specialized concurrent disorders program is a possibility.112Navigating the treatment system Hospital emergency departments In a crisis, you and your relative can go to the emergency department of a hospital. If the situation does not require immediate medical care, the next step may be a more in-depth assessment from a crisis worker. This person is often a nurse or social worker.

Do you refer clients to other agencies for some substance use and/or mental health services? If so, who is responsible for overall co-ordination of services? What percentage of your clients has co-occurring substance use and mentalhealth problems? What is your policy about using medication as a treatment option? Does the program support a full range of needs (e.g., social and medical)? What role do family members play in their relatives' treatment? Do you offer services and referrals for family members?113Navigating the treatment system SCREENING, ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS Screening Screening procedures are designed to identify whether someone might have a mental health and/or a substance use problem, and whether he or she should have a compre-hensive assessment. People who work in the substance use and mental health fields are encouraged to expect to see concurrent disorders rather than see them as an exception. However, some men-tal health agencies still don't screen clients for substance use problems, and some sub-stance use agencies don't screen clients for mental health problems. When your familymember begins treatment, ask if both problems have been considered. Assessment Assessments usually start with a conversation with the health care provider. Question-naires are often part of the assessment interview. The treatment provider investigates how the substance use and mental health problems interact. During an assessment,people are often asked to discuss things such as: why they have come for help, what kind of help they are looking for and what has helped in the past their physical condition general life problems, troubling thoughts or feelings, substance use problems, as well as how long problems have lasted whether they have experienced or seen violence (e.g., physical or sexual assault, war), even if it occurred years before whether there is a history of substance use or mental health problems in their family what their life is like (e.g., how they feel, what they think, how they sleep, if they exer- cise and socialize, how they do at school or work, how their relationships with friendsand family are) whether they've come to Canada in the last few years and/or whether they've come from a war-torn country what, if any, medications they take. The client and the treatment provider use the information from the assessment to develop a treatment plan. 114Navigating the treatment system Diagnosis It is not always necessary to have a diagnosis before starting treatment. However, a diagnosis may help to direct treatment. For example, a diagnosis may determine if a particular kind of therapy would be most helpful and whether there are medicationsthat could help treat the problem. Even if your relative does receive a preliminary diagnosis, it may change or be inter- preted differently by other health care providers over the course of treatment. It is oftenhard to determine whether symptoms are related to substance use or a mental healthproblem. The only way to figure out what you are dealing with is to see how the symp-toms develop over time. It's very difficult to identify the issues when it comes to mental illness and substance abuse. You know, cancer is much more clear-cut. And I don'tthink even the psychiatrists are really sure a lot of the time. They may besure of the diagnosis, but they often don't help very much with the progno-sis\u2014and that doesn't help the cause of families, who know this is an illnessthat can respond to medication. We all need to view mental illness as some-thing that can be treated, so at least there's hope out there! Having hopecan make all the difference in the world. TREATMENT PLANNING There is no single, correct intervention or program for people who have concurrent dis-orders. The treatment plan needs to be customized to address each client's particularneeds. Treatment plans should: identify issues and problems outline short-term and long-term goals establish approaches and interventions to meet the goals. In many cases, treatment includes helping a person with employment, housing, finances, leisure activities and basic daily self-care. The person giving the assessment may recom-mend your family member see a therapist or that he or she start taking medication.Joining a self-help group is also an important part of treatment for many people. Aperson may decide he or she simply needs more support during stressful times. Theultimate goal of treatment is for people to decide what a healthy future means for them and to find ways to live a healthy life. 115Navigating the treatment system Family involvement Families often provide the ongoing, day-to-day care, so they should be involved in treat- ment planning if possible. Families will often have information that should be consideredby the treatment team as part of the planning process. Their perspective may be differentthan that of the client or the treatment team. The amount of family participation will depend on the client. One barrier to family involvement cited by providers and families is unclear confidentiality policies. A treat- ment provider cannot share case-specific information with you without your familymember's agreement. Treatment providers should ask clients if they agree to family members participating in planning and treatment. However, many providers don't ask,so it's best if you talk to your family member and let the treatment team know what youhave agreed to. Have this agreement added to your family member's treatment record. Ifmore than one agency is involved in care, make sure each agency is aware of whetheryour relative has agreed to share information with you and whether the agency has a copy of that agreement in its files. You may need to start the conversation because each agencymay assume that the other has talked to your relative. Learning about substance use and mental health problems will help you recognize what type of information will be useful to the treatment team. It often helps to organize yourquestions and concerns into a document. Keep the document short and to the point,and keep the tone neutral. If possible, you and your relative should work together todecide what information to include. IF YOUR RELATIVE DOES NOT WANT YOU INVOLVED Even if your relative hasn't agreed to share treatment information with you, the treat-ment team can still talk to you about: the nature of substance use and mental health problems how to respond to disturbing behaviours how to get help in an emergency how to get help for yourself. The treatment provider can also listen to your observations. Avoid making treatment recommendations\u2014remember, you are not the attending physician or psychiatrist!\u2014butallow the treatment team to draw conclusions from the information you present. 116Navigating the treatment system Figure 7-1: Sample family information document Information provided to: Client's name:Form completed by:Relationship to client:Date: Issues that I am concerned about: 1.2. 3.4.5.

Questions to ask about the treatment plan If your relative has agreed to having you involved, here are some questions to ask about his or her treatment plan: What is the provisional diagnosis? What are the possible causes of my relative's problems? What is the proposed treatment? What are the benefits and risks of the treatment? Are other treatments available? What are the options if this treatment doesn't work?Tracking treatment People who have concurrent disorders often have a lengthy treatment history. Try using a chart to track treatment information. This document can be useful whenyou talk to the treatment team. 118Navigating the treatment system Type of TreatmentTreatment ProviderContact PersonStart Date / End DateCommentsIssues AddressedTREATMENT LOG119Navigating the treatment system TREATMENT In the past, treatment for people with severe mental illness and substance use problems tended to concentrate on the limits and impairments associated with mental healthproblems, while overlooking the strengths that people can often harness to achieve theirpersonal goals. We have found that treatment is more effective when it focuses on iden-tifying people's personal goals and abilities, and the personal and community resourcesand opportunities available to help them achieve their goals. Motivational approaches to treatment Motivational approaches can be more effective than conventional methods of workingwith people with concurrent disorders. Motivational approaches are also useful inencouraging people to identify their goals, and in building hope and commitment tochange and recovery. Some people enter therapy determined to change and are ready to talk about their rea- sons for wanting to change. However, many people are not motivated to change. Thereare many justifiable reasons for this: Some people may not even acknowledge that they have problems. People with concurrent disorders are more likely than others to have had previous unsuccessful attempts to change. The interaction of their substance use and mental health problems may have made it harder to follow treatment plans. They are more likely than other clients to feel discouraged about the prospects of improving their situation. They may also feel that substance use gives them relief from other symptoms and from their distress. Being ambivalent (being of two minds) about a particular behaviour is normal. How people balance the costs and benefits of a behaviour affects whether they'll continue orchange the behaviour. Motivational approaches use the client's perspective on his or her mental health and substance use problems as the starting point for treatment. It requires that therapistsget in touch with how the client sees things. This approach often opens a pathway to working on practical issues of concern to the client. This can include issues of healthand safety\u2014for example, finding housing\u2014even when the client isn't ready to changebehaviours that may actually contribute to the problem. Acknowledging the client's perception and lifestyle doesn't necessarily mean that the therapist agrees with that per-ception. The long-term objective is to help the client set goals and recognize that his or her current lifestyle interferes with achieving these goals. However, in the short-term, the family\u2014or others, such as an employer\u2014may not understand why the client andthe therapist are not working directly on the substance use and mental health problems. 120Navigating the treatment system Activity 7-1: Exploring ambivalence about change One of the fundamental techniques of the motivational approach is to look at the benefits and costs of not changing and the benefits and costs of changing.Therapists call this decisional balance. Think about what your relative might see as the benefits and costs of using sub- stances. It may help you understand why your family member uses substances oris reluctant to seek treatment. The benefits of continuing to usealcohol and/or other drugs for myfamily member may include: The costs of continuing to usealcohol and/or other drugs for myfamily member may include: The benefits of changing this useof alcohol and/or other drugs formy family member may include: The costs of changing this use ofalcohol and/or other drugs) for myfamily member may include:121Navigating the treatment system Motivation and substance use goals When people have concurrent disorders, abstinence is often the best long-term substance use goal. Continued use of alcohol and/or other drugs may worsen emo-tional and mental health problems and threaten a person's overall physical andpsychological well-being. However, many people may, at least at first, lack the con-fidence and skills to decrease or stop their substance use. So, when clinicians workwith someone who is struggling with both major substance use and mental healthproblems, the short-term goal is often to reduce the most harmful effects of sub-stance use while developing a strong working alliance with the client. This trustingrelationship can help clients understand the negative effects of their substance useand develop the motivation to address it. This approach\u2014not requiring the personto commit to abstinence as a condition for help\u2014is called harm reduction. STAGES OF CHANGE Changes in behaviour occur over a series of stages (Pruchaska et al., 1992). Recognizing what stage a particular a client is at can help clinicians decide which interventions aremore likely to be successful at a particular point in treatment and recovery. The stages of change model outlines five basic stages: precontemplation contemplation preparation action maintenance. Some people move steadily through the stages toward recovery. Others move rapidly and then slow down or stop for a while. People often relapse (return to problematicbehaviours), move backward through the stages and then move forward again.122Navigating the treatment system Table 7-1: Stages of change STAGES OF TREATMENT The stages of change model describes the process of behavioural change. Treatment strategies should be adapted to a person's motivation to change. Researchers have devel-oped a complementary step-wise model of stages of treatment. The model describesfour major stages: engagement persuasion active treatment relapse prevention.STAGE EXAMPLE Precontemplation \"I don't think I have a problem.\" Contemplation \"I'm not sure, but I might have a problem.\" Preparation \"I think I have a problem, but I am notsure what to do about it.\" Action \"I have a problem, and I want to changeit.

Clients may receive one or the other,or both. Types of therapy Individual therapy allows the therapist to focus his or her attention solely on the client, with no distraction from others. Individual therapy is especially helpful in developing aclose working relationship, exploring personal motivation and goals, and identifyingindividualized targets for intervention. Group therapy (groups led by professionals) approaches offer the advantage of promot- ing social support among clients and providing positive role models for clients at earlierstages of treatment. Groups usually consist of up to 10 people. Often two therapists run them. A group setting can be a comfortable place to discuss issues such as family relationships, medication side-effects and relapses. PSYCHOEDUCATION Psychoeducation is education about mental health and substance use issues. People whoknow about their problems are better prepared to make informed choices. Knowledge can help clients and their families deal with their problems, make plans to prevent future pro- blems and build a plan to support recovery. Everyone should receive psychoeducation when they begin treatment for concurrent disorders. Some people may have trouble processing or remembering information thatthey receive at this early stage. As they move through recovery, they may benefit morefrom psychoeducation. For people who have milder problems, psychoeducation alonemay be the only treatment they need. Psychoeducation sessions include discussions about: what causes substance use and mental health problems how the problems might be treated how to self-manage the problems (if possible) how to prevent future episodes. 130Navigating the treatment system PSYCHOTHERAPY Psychotherapy is sometimes called \"talk therapy.\" It helps people deal with their prob- lems by looking at how they think, act and interact with others. Certain types of psychotherapy are better for certain problems. Psychotherapy can be either short-term or long-term. Short-term therapy has a specific focus and structure. The therapist is active and directs the process. This type of treatment usually lasts no longer than 10 to 20 sessions. In long-term therapy, the therapist is generally less active, and the process is less struc- tured. The treatment usually lasts at least one year. The aim is to help the client workthrough deep psychological issues. Successful therapy depends on a supportive, comfortable relationship with a trusted therapist. The therapist can be a doctor, social worker, psychologist or other profes-sional. Therapists may work in hospitals, clinics and/or private practice. There are manydifferent types of psychotherapy. Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is based on the theory that thoughts have animportant influence on how people behave. Therapists help people to identify unhelp-ful thoughts and behaviours and learn healthier skills and habits. The client andtherapist identify goals and strategies. There is an emphasis on practising the skillsbetween sessions (homework). Social Skills Training Social skills training uses techniques such as role-playing, modelling, coaching, home-work and feedback to help people learn (or relearn) interpersonal skills and competencies. Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is a type of cognitive-behavioural therapy. It is usedto treat a range of behaviour problems. In DBT, people look at how their backgroundand their life experience affect how they control their emotions. DBT draws on westerncognitive-behavioural techniques and eastern Zen philosophies. It teaches clients how to: become more aware of their thoughts and actions (\"mindfulness\") tolerate distress manage their emotions get better at communicating with others improve their relationships with other people.131Navigating the treatment system Structured Relapse Prevention Structured Relapse Prevention (SRP) uses a cognitive-behavioural approach to help people with moderate to severe problems gain more control over their use of alcoholand other drugs. Psychodynamic (or Insight-Oriented) Therapy Psychodynamic psychotherapy, also referred to as insight-oriented therapy, is based onthe theory that unconscious processes (issues that a person may not be aware of) influ-ence behaviour. This approach helps people examine unresolved issues that haveresulted from relationship problems in their past. Interpersonal Therapy Interpersonal therapies help clients get better at communicating and interacting withothers. These therapies help people: look at how they interact with others identify issues and problems in relationships explore ways to make changes. Interpersonal group therapy focuses on the interactions among group members. Motivational Interviewing Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a method of enhancing a client's own motivation to change. MI was originally developed as a way of working with people with alcohol andother substance use problems. The approach is now used with people who have prob-lems such as bulimia, hypertension, diabetes and concurrent disorders. Peer support groups A peer support group is made up of people who all have similar problems. Groupmembers can share their struggles in a safe, supportive environment. People who haverecently been diagnosed with concurrent disorders can benefit from hearing about theexperiences of others. Group members usually develop strong bonds. There are peer support groups for clients and for families. Double Trouble groups and Dual Recovery Anonymous are examples of groups for clients. The Family Associationfor Mental Health Everywhere (FAME) has groups for families. Although these groupsare often called self-help, peer support actually offers a type of help called mutual aid. 132Navigating the treatment system Tips for evaluating peer support groups Most family self-help / mutual aid organizations are geared toward either mental health issues (e.g., Mood Disorders Association of Ontario or the SchizophreniaSociety of Ontario) or substance use issues (e.g., Al-Anon). However, many familymembers of people with concurrent disorders have found either or both of thesetypes of organizations and groups to be extremely helpful. If you decide to attend one of these groups, it is a good idea to evaluate them to decide if the particular group suits you and your situation. Questions to ask about a self-help group Does this group welcome new members? Do group members respect each other? Is the group relevant to my situation, concerns and needs? Are there any requirements for attending this group (e.g., a membership fee)? Is the group respectful and inclusive of family members from diverse backgrounds(e.g., from a range of cultural, racial, religious and economic backgrounds)? Does the group offer both support and education? Is the group ongoing or is it time-limited? Does the group have a positive attitude toward professional help for families? Who facilitates the group and how is the group process managed? If this group is for family members of persons with mental health problems: Is it OK to discuss my relative's substance use problems? Is the group willing to consider harm reduction as an option in substance use treatment? If this group is for family members of persons with substance useproblems: Is it OK to discuss my relative's mental health problems? Does the group support using medication to treat mental health problems?133Navigating the treatment system Therapy for family members Family members can also enter care as clients themselves. Family therapy can offer advice and support to family members and teach them: about concurrent disorders how to help the client and support treatment efforts how to care for themselves. Usually, therapists work with one family at a time. However, sometimes, family therapy is offered in a group setting with other families in similar situations. Group memberscan share feelings and experiences with other families who understand and supportthem. Family interventions take advantage of clients' natural support systems and can lead to the creation of a home/family environment that is supportive of decreased substance useand adherence to an overall treatment program for the mental health problem. CO-ORDINATING TREATMENT Assertive community treatment The assertive community treatment (ACT) model was developed to meet the needs of clients with severe mental illness who often experienced relapse and rehospitalization,frequently due to their inability or unwillingness to go to local mental health centres.The ACT team provides around-the-clock support and services such as case manage-ment, assessment, psychiatric care, employment and housing assistance, family supportand education, substance use treatment and other services that help a person to live inthe community. ACT teams may include a psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric nurse, social worker, peer support worker (someone with a similar problem or issue who offers support),caseworker, recreation therapist, addiction specialist, vocational (job) specialist and/oroccupational therapist who help with tasks of day-to-day living. Some team membersare linked to a hospital; others are based in the community. ACT team members usually meet with the client every day in the community (e.g., in the person's home or in a coffee shop). They make sure that people receive consistentcare and strong, ongoing support from the team members. ACT team services are usually accessed through a mental health agency. Like many other services, you are more likely to find ACT teams in cities and larger communities.134Navigating the treatment system In Ontario, the criteria used to decide which clients get priority for ACT services are: a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or another psychotic disorder significant problems with basic activities of daily living long-term problems (such as a co-occurring substance use disorder) that require eight or more hours of service per month. More details about the criteria are available in the Ontario Program Standards for ACT Teams (www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/ministry_reports/psychosis/psychosis.html). Case management Clinical case management has been the dominant model for co-ordinating and deliver- ing mental health treatment. The overall goals of this model are: to assess clients' needs to identify and provide necessary services to meet those needs to monitor client outcomes to determine the success of treatment interventions or the need for other services. In the ACT model, the responsibility for delivering services is shared by the team. In the case management model, services are provided by the case manager. However, casemanagement is most effective when the case manager is part of a multidisciplinary treat-ment team that also includes a psychiatrist and various other mental health careprofessionals (e.g., nurses and vocational specialists). CONTINUING CARE People with concurrent disorders should be entitled to a team of resource workers thattake an ongoing, respectful and proactive interest in supporting them and their fami-lies. Continuing care does not necessarily mean that the client and counsellor must continue to meet regularly, but that, from the counsellor's perspective, thedoor is always open and the client is welcome, even if the last contact was sometime ago. The long-term goal is a stable recovery and transition out of treatment. Because concur- rent disorders are often complex, recovery may include several transitions between levelsof care (e.g., between inpatient and outpatient care; between outpatient and communitycare). Treatment providers should take responsibility for managing the transition and forfollowing up to ensure that the new arrangement works. However, we know that this co-ordination is sometimes left to the family and the client. Transition or discharge planning should begin when the client enters care. You and your relative need to be involved. You should make sure that the treatment team135Navigating the treatment system understands how much care you can provide for your relative, and that services are put in place to fill any gaps. A transition plan should include a full array of services: case management child care financial support housing physical health needs a support network. When your relative leaves treatment, you need to be clear about how to reconnect with the service, if necessary. Questions to ask about a transition or discharge plan Has a follow-up session been scheduled? (If so, make sure you know the date and time, location, contact name and telephone number.) What medications have been prescribed? What are they for? What is the dosageof each prescription? When should they be taken? Have relapse risk factors/triggers been identified? If your relative isn't living with you: What arrangements have been made for housing? Have resources been identified to help the person reconnect to employment, school or vocational training? It takes a lot of effort and commitment to make the mental health and substance use systems work for your relative. You should be recognized as a partner in organizing and delivering the care your relative needs, so educate yourself about concurrent dis-orders and treatment options, be persistent, ask questions\u2014and keep asking themuntil you get the information you need REFERENCES Prochaska, J.O., DiClemente, C.C. & Norcross, J.C.

In most cases, medications are more effective if they are combined with someof the interventions that were discussed in Chapter 7. Often, psychiatric medication will help stabilize people and clarify their thinking so they can focus on treatments such as cognitive-behavioural therapy, group therapy orfamily-focused therapy. Types of psychiatric medication Most mental health medications are used to help restore chemical balance in the brain.This can help to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms. Medications are dividedinto four main groups based on the problems that they were developed to treat: \u00b7 antidepressants \u00b7 mood stabilizers \u00b7 anti-anxiety medications / sedatives \u00b7 antipsychotics. Medications have a generic (or chemical) name and a brand (or trade) name that is spe- cific to the company that makes the medication. For example, the generic antipsychoticclozapine is sold under the brand name Clozaril. The brand name may change depend-ing on the country in which the medication is marketed. Figure 8-1: Traditional uses for classes of psychiatric medications Mood Disorders Anxiety Disorders Sleep Disorders Psychotic DisordersAntidepressants Mood Stabilizers Sedatives/Anti-anxiety Antipsychotics139Medication Despite the four distinct classes of psychiatric medications listed above, each type of medication can be used to treat various disorders. For example, a person who takes amood stabilizer to treat bipolar disorder may also take an antidepressant, anti-anxiety orantipsychotic medication to treat symptoms such as depression, sleep problems, anxietyor psychosis. Figure 8-2: Alternative uses for classes of psychiatric medications Mood Disorders Anxiety Disorders Sleep Disorders Psychotic Disorders Eating Disorders Substance UseAntidepressants Mood Stabilizers Sedatives/Anti-anxiety Antipsychotics ANTIDEPRESSANTS Antidepressants work via a number of different mechanisms, but the end result is to increase the level of communication between nerve cells in the brain. While they wereoriginally used to treat depression, antidepressants are also used to treat chronic pain,bulimia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome and anxiety disor-ders. In fact, antidepressants, especially the class known as selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitors (SSRIs) such as Prozac, are used more often to treat anxiety disorders than aretraditional anti-anxiety medications such as Valium. MOOD STABILIZERS Mood stabilizers are used to help control mood swings (extreme highs and lows) con-nected with bipolar disorder, and to prevent further episodes of this condition. Lithiumwas the rst mood stabilizer on the market and is still a useful medication. Other med-ications used to stabilize mood include anticonvulsants, which were developed to treatepilepsy and other seizure disorders. 140Medication Treatment of bipolar disorder depends on the individual's symptoms. Bipolar disorder may also be treated with antidepressants in combination with mood stabilizers. ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATIONS / SEDATIVES The main group of medications in this class consists of benzodiazepines, such as diazepam (Valium) and lorazepam (Ativan). While they are legitimate medications for treating anxiety and sleep disorders, they can become addictive if used for more than about fourweeks; they also have the potential to be abused (see \"Medication abuse or dependence,\"p. 148). An anti-anxiety medication that can be used for a longer period of time is buspirone (BuSpar). ANTIPSYCHOTICS Antipsychotics reduce the effect of dopamine in the brain. They are traditionally used to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The newer, second-generation anti-psychotics are now also being tested as mood stabilizers, anti-anxiety medication andeven as a treatment for refractory depression (depression that is difficult to treat). For more information about psychiatric medications, see: Medications (published by the National Institute of Mental Health in the U.S., and available online at www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/NIMHmedicate.pdf). Psychotherapeutic Medications 2006 (published by the Addiction Technology Transfer Center in the U.S. and available online at www.mattc.org/_media/publications/pdf/Medications2006_5.pdf). DRUG THERAPY FOR SUBSTANCE USE PROBLEMS Medication is not used as often to treat substance use problems as it is to treat mental health problems. However, sometimes medication is added to other behavioural andpsychological treatments. Treatment strategies include: withdrawal management substitution therapy antagonist therapy aversive therapy. 141Medication Withdrawal management The main objective in the pharmacological treatment of drug withdrawal is to prevent severe complications, particularly seizures in the case of some drugs (e.g., alcohol, bar-biturates, benzodiazepines) that can happen when people stop using substances. Medi-cation is also sometimes used to help prevent relapse. Substitution therapy In substitution therapy, the substance of abuse is replaced with a medication that is less likely to be abused. Substituting methadone, a synthetic opioid, for heroin is one exam-ple of substitution therapy. Methadone suppresses the withdrawal symptoms of otheropioids as well as the chronic craving, without causing a person to become euphoric or tolerant to the medication. The side-effects of methadone include: drowsiness, insomnia, dysphoria (feeling uneasy), weakness, dizziness, light-headed- ness and nervousness nausea, vomiting, chronic constipation, decreased appetite and dry mouth sweating, flushing, impotence and ejaculatory problems. Antagonist therapy Antagonist therapy blocks the effects of opioids. For example, naltrexone (ReVia) is some-t imes used to block the effects of alcohol. It is used to help maintain abstinence following withdrawal from opioids or alcohol. It is most useful in highly motivated clients. The side-effects of naltrexone include: insomnia, anxiety, nervousness, dysphoria, depression, lethargy, fatigue, confusion and headache abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting and weight loss joint and muscle pain. Aversive therapy In aversive therapy, a medication is prescribed that will cause unpleasant side-effects ifsubstances are also used. Aversive therapy discourages use of the substance. Disulfiram(formerly marketed under the trade name Antabuse) is an example of aversive therapy todiscourage alcohol use. Although Antabuse is no longer made commercially in Canada,pharmacies can make capsules using disulfiram powder.142Medication The symptoms that result when disulfiram is combined with alcohol include: nausea and dry mouth flushing, sweating, throbbing head and palpitations. MEDICATION MANAGEMENT While full remission and recovery are possible, the amount of symptom relief varies from person to person. There is still a great deal of trial and error involved in findingthe best medication for each person. You and your relative should be involved in thedecision-making process, and be given information about the benefits and risks, includ-ing side-effects, of medications. Identifying and minimizing side-effects Side-effects may increase or decrease over time, and can range from mild discomfort toproblems that are severe enough to make it impossible to cope with day-to-day life. Yourrelative should feel comfortable discussing side-effects with family members as well aswith his or her treatment team. People often stop taking medication because of unpleas-ant side-effects, without reporting them to anyone. It is dangerous to stop or changemedication without consulting the treatment team. The treatment team can suggest ways to minimize side-effects. Strategies include: taking the medication in smaller doses spread out over the day taking medication with appropriate food taking an additional medication to treat specific side-effects changing the medication. It is sometimes surprising how much of a difference even a very small dosage adjust- ment can make in how someone responds to treatment or is affected by side-effects.While a higher dose may be needed to control an acute episode, a person can generallybe kept on a lower dose. The dose may need to be changed over time. There are also practical, non-pharmacological strategies that your relative can use to deal with side-effects. Some of these are listed in Table 8-1. 143Medication Table 8-1: Managing common side-effects Side-Effect Dry mouth Dry eyes and/or blurred vision Constipation Urinary retentionManagement StrategiesANTICHOLINERGIC EFFECTS chewing sugarless gum or sucking on sugarless or sour candy (both dry mouth and excess sugar can increase the risk oftooth decay) ensuring good mouth hygiene, including frequent brushing,flossing and use of mouthwashes having regular dental checkups using oral lubricants (e.g., MoiStir) reading under a bright light while holding the reading mate-rial at a distance getting a prescription for eye drops increasing fluid intake (e.g., water, juice and other non-caf-feinated, non-alcoholic beverages) increasing regular physical activity and exercise increasing dietary bre (e.g., bran, raw fruits and vegetables) trying a bulk laxative (e.g., Metamucil, Prodiem) or stool sof-tener (e.g., Surfak, Colace) avoiding regular stronger or stimulant laxatives (e.g.,sennosides [Senokot], bisacodyl [Dulcolax]). using patience and running water while attempting to urinateif problem is mild getting a prescription medication to help counteract thiseffect if problem is more severe144Medication Side-Effect Drowsiness Lack of muscle co-ordination ormuscle weakness(ataxia) HeadacheManagement Strategies CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM EFFECTS taking most of the dose, or the full dose if possible, at bedtime using caution when driving or operating machinery checking with a doctor since it may be due to too high a dose trying over-the-counter headache remedies such as acetamin- ophen (Tylenol), aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil)\u2014but rst askinga doctor or pharmacist to check for possible drug interactions getting a prescription for a different medication if, with time,headaches don't go away Side-Effect Extrapyramidal effects (tremor, restlessness, muscle stiffness and spasms, difficulty walking)Management Strategies INCREASED ENERGY (ACTIVATION EFFECT) adjusting the dose getting a prescription for antiparkinsonian drugs (e.g., ben- ztropine [Cogentin]\u2014but this medication must be monitored, as excessive doses may cause other side-effects such as disori-entation, confusion and delirium) taking propranolol, a prescription medication used to treattremor or restlessness taking a benzodiazepine restlessness145Medication Side-Effect Nausea DiarrheaManagement StrategiesGASTROINTESTINAL EFFECTS taking medications with meals, having small snacks or drink- ing milk not using antacids within two hours of taking the medication,as they may interfere with drug absorption trying loperamide (Imodium) or attapulgite (Kaopectate) afterchecking with a doctor or pharmacist for any drug interac-tions taking smaller doses throughout the day or\u2014if thediarrhea is the result of taking lithium\u2014using a slow-releasepreparation (sudden diarrhea may indicate lithium toxicity) Side-Effect Dizziness, fainting Rapid heartbeat High blood pressureManagement StrategiesCARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS getting up slowly from a lying or sitting position and dangling feet wearing support hose and doing calf exercises to reduce bloodpooling in the calves taking the drug in smaller, divided doses throughout the day reporting this side-effect to a doctor\u2014however, this is usuallynot a serious problem speaking to a doctor about reducing the dose, changing med-ications or adding a high blood pressure medication146Medication Questions for the doctor or pharmacist about medication: What is the name of the medication, and what is it supposed to do?

This can be useful when you meet with the treatment team.

You can help by: ranking symptoms of the illnesses on a scale of one to 10 and reporting any improvement noting side-effects and discussing them with the treatment team checking with a doctor and/or pharmacist for drug interactions before your relative takes any new medication (prescription or over-the-counter). MEDICATION ABUSE OR DEPENDENCE Health professionals have a very important consideration when prescribing pharmaco-logical treatment for mental health problems in clients with a history of a substance usedisorder. That's the possibility the client may abuse or become dependent on the med-ication being prescribed. Abusing a medication means taking more of the medication than prescribed to try to get other effects (e.g., to get \"high\"). Dependence means that a person becomes tolerant toa medication's effects, and needs to use more and more of the medication to get theeffect. This person will also experience withdrawal if he or she stops using the medica-tion suddenly. Becoming dependent on a medication may not be due to abusing amedication. Anti-anxiety medications, stimulants and opioids are the prescription drugsthat are most likely to be abused. The minimal reinforcing properties, along with trou-blesome side-effects, usually limit the abuse liability of antidepressants, antipsychoticsand mood stabilizers. The following variables influence the likelihood of someone abus-ing or becoming dependent on medications: Substances vary in their ability to produce good feelings or pleasant effects (reinforc- ing effects). Someone is more likely to abuse a drug if its effects are felt quickly. A drug's potency or purity can influence its potential to be abused. A drug's cost and availability can also influence its potential to be abused. In general, drug effects vary greatly from one person to another. Because each person's genes are different, the drug is metabolized differently in different people. People mayeven respond differently to the same drug taken at the same dose. People may also self-medicate to cope with symptoms of a mental health problem, such as depression and anxiety. Starting and continuing to use and abuse substances (including abusing prescribed medications) is influenced by peer pressure and societal norms. Employment andeducation and the availability of other pleasurable activities (e.g., sports, socializing,club activities, recreation) have also been shown to be protective factors against drug-taking behaviour. 149Medication Benzodiazepines There is still no agreement about the best approach to take with clients with anxiety and substance use problems. Some researchers strongly oppose prescribing benzodi-azepines unless they are being given to people who are going through detoxification orwho are in the acute stages of an anxiety syndrome. These researchers believe that peo-ple should stop taking benzodiazepines once another class of effective medication t akes effect, as benzodiazepine use can lead to physical dependence, misuse and increased drug use. Other investigators believe that although such drugs should be avoided in manycases, the decision to prescribe benzodiazepines must be made based on each client'sindividual circumstances. Anyone who takes benzodiazepines should have a complete medical and mental health assessment. The clinician should consider whether the client has tried alternative med-ication and whether a psychosocial approach to treatment might be enough to help theclient recover, manage his or her anxiety, or prevent relapse. Clients should be told aboutrisks such as seizures if alcohol or benzodiazepines are stopped abruptly. DRUG INTERACTIONS A drug interaction occurs when one drug alters the action or effects of another drug alsopresent in the body. Some interactions are trivial, while others can be dangerous andpossibly life-threatening. Drugs taken together: can act independently of each other. For example, alcohol does not seem to interfere with the action of vitamins or oral contraceptives, or vice versa. can increase each other's effects. This could happen because they affect the brain in the same way or because one drug increases the concentration of the other in the body.For instance, alcohol and antihistamines are both central nervous system depressants.Therefore, the combination can increase both the desired effects of the drugs (e.g., dis-inhibition or decreasing of self-control) as well as the side-effects (e.g., drowsiness). can decrease each other's intended effects (an antagonistic effect). This could occur when one drug \"blocks\" or prevents another drug from producing its effect. It couldalso happen when two drugs have opposite effects on the brain (e.g., alcohol-induceddrowsiness versus caffeine-induced alertness). Consequences of drug interactions An important factor in choosing a medication for someone with concurrent disorders isto pay attention to potential toxic interactions between the prescribed medication andthe drugs of abuse. This is important in case the person relapses on the substance whiletaking prescribed psychiatric medication.150Medication In some cases, drugs do interact but the result does not noticeably affect the person. How- ever, combining substances of abuse, which can have toxic effects on their own, withprescription medications often has consequences that are much more serious. The mostcommon toxic effects are: central nervous system depression, which, at its mildest, is drowsiness, but in its more severe form, can lead to a coma respiratory depression, which can lead to the person stopping breathing altogether cardiac effects, such as blood vessels constricting or dilating, or changes in heart rhythm that can lead to the heart stopping decreased seizure threshold, meaning that the brain can have a seizure more easily psychiatric effects, such as psychosis. Some of the more common combinations and their effects are listed below. STIMULANTS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS If a stimulant, such as cocaine or methylphenidate, is taken with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant, a hypertensive reaction (high blood pressure) can occur.There have been many reports of rapid onset of headaches and severe hypertension whenamphetamines are consumed by people who are taking MAOIs, some with fatal outcomesfrom cerebral hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain). The combination of a stimulant anda tricyclic antidepressant can cause an increased heart rate. CANNABIS AND ANTIPSYCHOTICS Marijuana can decrease the effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs and increase the risk ofrelapse. Taken with certain antipsychotic drugs, marijuana can also lead to marked hypo-tension (low blood pressure) and increased disorientation. There can also be additiveeffects with anticholinergics and other medications that have anticholinergic side-effects,leading to such symptoms as increased dry mouth, urinary retention and constipation. TOBACCO AND ANTIPSYCHOTICS Smoking decreases the blood concentration level of certain antipsychotics by 20 to 100per cent, so smokers require higher doses. If a person reduces or quits smoking while tak- ing an antipsychotic, the blood concentration levels of the drug will increase, leading toincreased side-effects and possibly toxicity. Therefore, dose decreases are usually required,but must be monitored closely. TOBACCO AND BENZODIAZEPINES Some of the substances in tobacco can stimulate the liver enzymes that metabolizediazepam and chlordiazepoxide. This causes them to clear from the body more quickly,leading to a need for higher doses. 151Medication CAFFEINE AND LITHIUM Caffeine acts as a diuretic, which can worsen incontinence. This affects water balance and can therefore affect lithium levels. Caffeine can also increase excretion of lithiumfrom the kidneys and lead to lithium tremor. People who take lithium may still havesome caffeine in their diet, but it is important that they do not drastically change theirintake from day to day. ONGOING TREATMENT Clients and their families are often concerned about how long they will be taking med-ications. In some situations, the treatment will be short-term, as in the case of a sleepingpill for temporary insomnia. For a first episode of depression, medication is recommendedfor at least one year. For bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, the period of treatment isusually indefinite to prevent symptoms from returning. In the case of a first-episode psy-chosis, it can be difficult to distinguish between a drug-induced psychosis and schizo-phrenia. If a client does not have symptoms for several months, it may be possible toslowly taper and then stop the medication, with close monitoring. Many mental health problems are lifelong conditions, so treatment with medications is often indefinite. Once an acute episode has been successfully treated, you, your relativeand the treatment team need to watch for any signs of possible relapse. STOPPING MEDICATION People are often ambivalent about staying on their medications. Reasons for the ambiva-lence include: unpleasant side-effects feeling well and no longer seeing the need to take medications messages from peers (e.g., 12-step peers) that you should be able to cope without any substances, including prescribed ones concerns about interactions with alcohol or other substances. Families should encourage their relatives to talk about problems with medications\u2014 with the hope that they will fully explore what could happen if they suddenly decide tostop taking a medication. For clients who choose not to take their medication: Acknowledge they have a right to choose not to use any medication. Stress that they owe it to themselves to make sure their decision is well thought out. (It is an important decision about their personal health and they need to discuss itwith their doctor.) Ask their reason for choosing not to take the medication.152Medication Don't accept \"I just don't like pills.\" Tell them you are sure they wouldn't make such an important decision without having a reason. Offer as examples reasons others might choose not to take medication. For instance, they: -don't believe they ever needed it (i.e., they were never mentally ill) -don't believe they need it anymore (i.e., they are cured) -don't like the side-effects -fear the medication will harm them -struggle with objections or ridicule of friends and family members -feel taking medication means they're not personally in control. Medication is often an important part of a treatment plan for concurrent disorders, but finding the most effective medication, or combination of medications, can be a long,frustrating process. You can help by learning about the benefits and risks of the medica-tions that your relative is taking, and by talking with your relative and the treatmentteam about how the medication is working, and the nature and severity of side-effects.Make sure the medication and dosage are reviewed regularly. If you are not satisfied,you and your relative can ask for a second opinion. REFERENCES National Institute of Mental Health. (2005). Medications. Bethesda: MD.

Relapse prevention for substance use problems Relapse prevention for mental health problemsRelapse prevention154Relapse prevention WHAT IS RELAPSE? A relapse occurs when a person in recovery re-experiences problems or symptoms asso- ciated with his or her disorders. With substance use disorders, a relapse means a returnto problem substance use after a period of abstinence or controlled use. With mentalhealth disorders, a relapse is a flare-up of symptoms that are associated with the disorder.A relapse of one disorder can sometimes trigger relapse of the other. There are many contributing factors and warning signs that indicate that a person may be in danger of returning to substance use or redeveloping symptoms related to mentalhealth problems. RELAPSE PREVENTION FOR SUBSTANCE USE PROBLEMS A relapse is an expected part of the recovery process in substance use treatment. Usually there are warning signs that start long before the relapse. It is possible to identify thesewarning signs and take action to prevent a relapse. If a relapse does occur, it is not a sign that treatment has failed, or that a person has a weak character, or that the caregiver is at fault in any way. A person with a substanceuse problem needs to learn and practise a variety of skills to prevent relapses. A relapseshould be seen as an opportunity for the person to think about how to manage similarsituations in the future. However, if someone relapses over and over again, it may be asign of a more serious, undiagnosed disorder, such as posttraumatic stress disorder. It's common for people to have ongoing urges and cravings that they must deal with to prevent a relapse. Risk factors People may experience situations or feelings that put them at greater risk of relapsing. Aperson who has a stressful, demanding life may see substance use as the only way to getpleasure or escape stress. The following factors can increase the chances that a personwill relapse: negative emotional states, such as anger, anxiety, depression, frustration or boredom conflict with others that leads to negative emotions social pressure from peers who use substances. Positive occasions, such as birthdays, anniversaries or reunions may also increase the chances of a relapse if alcohol is part of the celebration. Any intense feelings, even155Relapse prevention happy ones, can be uncomfortable for some people. As a result, they may use substances to try and reduce the emotional intensity. Other people may use substances to try andintensify positive emotions. Preventing substance use relapse A person who copes effectively with high-risk situations is less likely to relapse. Also, aperson who recognizes that substance use can lead to negative consequences, despitethe fact that it may bring temporary pleasure, is less likely to relapse than a person whoonly acknowledges the pleasure. When people have one relapse, their reaction to this \"slip\" can affect whether they go back to a pattern of heavy use. People who feel that they have no control over their useare more likely to use substances again. Those who see the relapse as a single event inwhich they didn't cope effectively, and as an opportunity to develop more effective waysto deal with similar triggers, are more likely to avoid using substances again. Relapse prevention strategies for substance use problems The following strategies can help your family member prevent a relapse: Become familiar with a return, or worsening, of symptoms of the person's mental health problems (such as manic behaviour, worsening of depression,self-harm behaviour) that have, in the past, frequently been associated with asubstance use relapse. Identify situations in which the person may have problems coping (e.g., formany people, it is risky to be in places where they used substances before\u2014suchas in a bar\u2014and to be around people they used to drink or use with). Develop strategies to deal with these high-risk situations. For example, a personcould be prepared to refuse drinks in social situations by going to an establish-ment that offers interesting non-alcoholic drinks or going with friends who willsupport their decision not to drink and who do not drink to excess themselves. Remove items that might trigger use (e.g., someone who has a problem withalcohol could remove all alcohol, favourite drinking glasses, corkscrews and bottle openers, at least temporarily, from the house). Practise techniques to deal with stressful situations (e.g., meditation, angermanagement, positive thinking and withdrawal from the situation) Pursue activities that increase a sense of balance in life, such as relaxation train-ing, stress management, time management, pet ownership, exercise and yoga. Make a \"relapse road map\" that outlines and emphasizes choices available tocope with or avoid high-risk situations. Be prepared for relapse. Try to understand what triggered it. Think of a relapse as an opportunity to plan for similar situations in the future, not as a mistake.156Relapse prevention As people learn new skills and use them to avoid relapse and deal with stress, they develop a sense of mastery, which, in turn, decreases the risk of relapse. RELAPSE PREVENTION FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS Some people only have one episode of mental illness, but many people have more than one episode. In some cases, the mental health problem is expected to recur. Studies have shown that people can learn to recognize and manage their symptoms and reduce the chances that they will relapse. If they do relapse, the symptoms may beless severe. There are some common factors that may contribute to relapse for many mental health disorders. However, sometimes there is no obvious reason. Risk factors People may experience situations or feelings that put them at greater risk of relapsing. A person who has a stressful, demanding life can be more vulnerable to relapse. Lack ofregular routines and a poor diet and sleeping habits can also have a negative impact. Alack of social, family and community support may be a factor. Some common triggers are: substance use or abuse medication use problems\u2014medication is stopped, taken irregularly or the dose is too low high levels of criticism, hostility or too much emotional involvement from family members (high emotional expression) conflicts with others severe mental stress, such as the death of a loved one condition-specific triggers\u2014for example, the anniversary of a traumatic event could be a trigger for someone with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) feelings, thoughts or situations that have come before a previous episode of illness other medical or physical problems.157Relapse prevention Relapse prevention strategies for mental health problems The following strategies can help your family member prevent a relapse: Identify signs of relapse and work with a professional to develop a relapse pre- vention plan. Take medication as prescribed, and speak to the doctor if it is not working or if side-effects are too unpleasant. Recognize situations that may trigger symptoms, and try to avoid them orreduce exposure to them. Learn about the disorders. Psychoeducation\u2014formal learning about mental ill-ness by the individual and family members\u2014reduces the rate of relapse. Apply skills learned in treatment to deal with symptoms. Practise techniques to deal with stressful situations. Examples include medita-tion, anger management and positive thinking. Develop a structured routine. Pursue lifestyle choices and activities that increasea sense of balance in life, such as relaxation training, stress management,assertiveness training and conflict resolution.158Relapse prevention Activity 9-1: Identifying risk factors List specific factors that might lead your relative to relapse of his or her substance use and/or mental health problem. Activity 9-2: Relapse prevention strategies Not only is it crucial for families to become aware of potential warning signs ofrelapse, it is also important for families to develop an action plan to deal withrelapses of their relative's substance use and/or mental health problem. Whataction would you take if you saw warning signs of relapse in your relative (e.g., sitdown with your loved one in a quiet place and gently discuss your concerns, andsuggest that he or she make an appointment to see the doctor, therapist and/orcase manager)?159Relapse prevention Activity 9-3: Caregiver relapse prevention plan Think about your own needs as the relative of a person with concurrent substance use and mental health problems. As we discussed in Chapter 5, it is essential foryou to take good care of yourself and to develop a self-care regime. Should youbegin to notice signs of increased stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue or othersymptoms in your self that might indicate that you are becoming overwhelmed (caregiver relapse ), what steps might you take to care for yourself? Write down a personal \"caregiver relapse prevention action plan\" for yourself. If my family member suffers a relapse, I will take the following steps to care for my:Physical health: Emotional health: Social health: Spiritual health:160Relapse prevention Sample caregiver relapse prevention plan Physical health: If my husband Frank starts drinking again, I will take care of myself physically by taking a \"time out\" to go for a long walk. This helps me to clear my head andcalm down so I don't blow up at him and call him a failure. I will also try to stickwith my plan to eat good food, but if I slip and go back to junk food a couple oftimes, I will be kind to myself\u2014relapses are stressful for all of us in the family andif I eat a bag of chips when I'm upset, it doesn't mean I'm an awful person. I willjust go back to eating a good diet afterward. Emotional health:I will take care of myself emotionally by reading the material that I got from my family support group and from Frank's therapist about why people who stopdrinking suddenly start again. This always helps me to remember that addictionis an illness that gets better gradually. It will also remind me that recovery isoften a long, slow process and that relapses are often part of the person's jour-ney. Maybe this will help both me and my husband learn something positivefrom this experience. I will also read the material I have about bipolar disorder to remind myself that sometimes, when people start getting too high or too depressed, they might turnto alcohol for comfort. All of these things help me cope when Frank picks up adrink again after being sober for a while. When I understand what's going on bet-ter, I don't blame him or myself. This helps me to stay calm and I don't end upfreaking out. Social health:If Frank relapses, I will call my best friends: Lucy from my family mood disorders support group, and Beth from my Al-Anon group. I will ask them to go to a familygroup meeting with me and then out for a coffee after. Spiritual health:I will increase the length of my yoga exercises to more than 15 minutes, and I will go back to my daily meditation readings.10 Outline Understanding crises and emergencies Whose crisis is it? Limit-setting Dealing with inappropriate behaviour Example of an escalating crisis When a crisis becomes an emergency Creating an emergency plan Creating a crisis planCrisis and emergency162Crisis and emergency UNDERSTANDING CRISES AND EMERGENCIES Even the best planning can't always prevent a relapse. Sometimes a relapse develops into a crisis. A crisis may also occur with little or no warning. A crisis is any serious deterioration of a person's ability to cope with everyday life. It can be a turning point\u2014for better or worse. It does not necessarily involve a danger of seriousphysical harm. A crisis develops when people feel they cannot control their feelings and behaviour and have trouble coping with the demands of day-to-day life. People in crisis may experience extreme despair, sorrow or anger. They may not be able to sleep,they may hear voices or they may believe that they have superhuman powers. Althoughpeople in crisis are not necessarily a danger to themselves or anyone else, in many crisissituations, outside help (the person's doctor or therapist, a mobile crisis service or crisisline) is needed. An emergency is a situation in which there is an immediate danger that the person will harm either him- or herself or someone else (Chan & Noone, 2000). Examples of emergencies: threats of suicide threats of physical violence extreme impaired judgment caused by problems such as psychosis or intoxication. WHOSE CRISIS IS IT? Sometimes issues related to concurrent disorders happen suddenly. The symptoms, pro-blems and needs of the person affected create a crisis that galvanizes all members of thefamily into action. At other times, issues can unfold slowly, and may build until some-one in the family decides that it's time to take action. For example, a behaviour that hasbecome quite regular, such as an adolescent son coming home intoxicated, can suddenly become a heated issue because a parent decides that it is finally time to address this beha- viour. Another example is a person who skips one session in his or her treatment programbecause of feeling down, but is confident that he or she will go back the next day. Familymembers may react strongly because they are worried that the person might be backslid-ing, missing needed care and risking relapse. In both of these examples, how family members will perceive the situation will vary. One person might feel that things are at a point where immediate action is necessary\u2014thatthings are in crisis; another might not see why today has to be treated differently than anyother day. Sometimes the person with the co-occurring problems feels that something hassuddenly gone seriously wrong and needs immediate attention, while family membersaren't as concerned. In other situations, family members are convinced that action needsto be taken, but the person with the problems may not agree, or may be afraid of whattaking action will mean for them. 163Crisis and emergency So you need to ask yourself: Whose crisis is it? The answer will help you understand who is really asking for help\u2014your relative, the family or both. LIMIT-SETTING Setting limits can help to prevent conflicts from turning into crises. Conflicts can resultfrom interpersonal problems between the person who is ill and his or her family mem-bers, or between the ill individual and other people. The family member with concurrent disorders may also experience conflict for other reasons, such as changes in his or her daily routine, difficulties with finances or loss of housing. Family members may feel guilty when they set limits on their ill loved one's behaviours or insist that he or she follow the rules and guidelines that everyone else in the family isexpected to follow. By refusing to set limits, families may believe that they are being helpful in preventing their relative from becoming unnecessarily upset or angry. Consistent rules and bound-aries can help to create a sense of predictability and security. It is usually best to avoid: making excuses (e.g., \"He's just upset today.\" \"She'll go to her day program tomorrow.\" \"A few drinks won't hurt him and it may help him calm down.\" \"It's okay if she comeshome late. She has such a hard life.\") paying their bills giving extra money, often over and over again, and being surprised when it's used to buy more alcohol or other drugs bailing the person out of jail making excuses for irresponsible behaviour ignoring problems (e.g., mental, emotional, financial, employment, legal) caused by the person's substance use accepting excuses or believing lies. DEALING WITH INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOUR Don't allow: yelling, swearing or other forms of emotional aggression physical aggression dangerous behaviour such as smoking in bed stealing from family members or friends misuse of money that is intended for rent or other basic needs. Although it may be difficult when your loved one suffers from concurrent disorders, itcan be helpful to set limits on his or her use of alcohol and/or other drugs in your home.164Crisis and emergency When objecting to unacceptable behaviour, be clear and request specific changes in the person's behaviour. For instance: Identify problems (e.g., spending weekly allowance on alcohol rather than on bus fare, or coming home late intoxicated and disturbing other family members). Work on one problem at a time. Avoid making demands or becoming confrontational. Clearly state your expectations for the future in a positive, non-judgmental, non- threatening manner. For example, try saying \"I would like you to \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014.\" or \"We would really appreciate it if you would \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014.\" or \"It is important to me (and/or other members of the family) that you help us by \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014.\" Help the person to understand the consequences of ignoring a boundary or limit on a particular behaviour (e.g., no additional money will be given that week; you will buybus tickets and give them to your relative rather than giving him or her the money,which could be spent on alcohol). Be consistent in both limit-setting and following through with consequences. Review the limits set on particular behaviours and redesign the plan as necessary. EXAMPLE OF AN ESCALATING CRISIS Sometimes a sudden change in daily routine triggers a crisis that escalates into an emer-gency. Sometimes there is nothing that family members can do to prevent a crisis.Other times family members can prevent\u2014or trigger\u2014a crisis. Read the following scenario and think about whether, had family members acted differ- ently, the outcome could have been less severe. Sam (who is away for the weekend) and Vera have three children, John (24 years old), Steven (20 years old) and Anna (16 years old). John and Anna live at home and Stevenlives in a student residence nearby. Anna is in Grade 10. John has schizophrenia (diag-nosed when he was 19) and a substance use problem (diagnosed recently). John takesmedication for symptoms of psychosis and anxiety, but still finds it hard to deal with anychanges in his life. When changes occur, he tends to become anxious and depressed andoften uses alcohol to try to calm himself. When he drinks, he can easily become angry and often explodes with rage over the slight- est provocation. He sometimes throws things and curses at family members. He then goesto his room to smoke cigarettes and listen to music until he falls asleep. His family care-fully and discreetly monitors his smoking and takes turns watching him until he fallsasleep. After sleeping for up to 15 hours, he usually wakes up calm, sober and with nomemory of what had occurred the previous day. One weekend, John learns that his therapist for the past five years is moving to another city and that he will have to start seeing another doctor. John is visibly upset and beginspacing around the house. His mother and sister are at home. They are careful to stay out165Crisis and emergency of his way except to gently ask him if they can help. John becomes so agitated that he ends up leaving and, rather than going to his day treatment program to speak to one of hisworkers, goes to a local bar. After drinking four or five beers, he starts to experience feel-ings of anger and paranoia. He wants a cigarette but realizes that he just spent the last ofhis allowance on beer. When John finally returns home, Vera realizes that he is intoxicated. John approaches his mother in the kitchen and angrily tells her that he has no money and that he needs 10dollars to buy cigarettes. Vera asks him what happened to the allowance that she gave himthree days ago. John slams his fist on the table and screams at her that he used the moneyfor food, and threatens to \"kill somebody\" if she refuses to give him what he wants. Whilethis is happening, John's younger brother Steven comes into the kitchen. Anna comes intothe kitchen from the living room and, hearing what is going on, fears for her mother'ssafety. She decides not to interfere, and stays quietly in the doorway. Vera, seeing that her son John is becoming more and more agitated, angry, belligerent and demanding, quickly grabs her purse and is about to take out her wallet to give himthe 10 dollars when Steven runs over and tells her to put her wallet back in her purse.Steven then angrily moves nearer to John and yells, \"Look, you lazy jerk, I've just abouthad it with you. She is not going to give you any more of her hard-earned money just sothat you can blow it on booze and cigarettes. And you're drunk again, aren't you?! Well,I'm sick of your crap. Nobody is going to give into you anymore. Mom, don't give him any-more money. He shouldn't be smoking anyway.\" Steven keeps getting closer to John until they are staring right at each other, face to face. AsSteven continues to yell at John, John begins to shake in anger and raises one fist while, with hisother arm, he reaches into a kitchen cupboard and grabs a steak knife. In a split second, hestabs Steven in the stomach and Steven falls to the floor. Vera, watching in horror, turns to pickup the phone to call for help, when John rushes into the living room and begins pacing whilestill holding the knife. Anna runs into the kitchen to help her mother. Vera shouts for Anna tocall 911 and get an ambulance. She also tells Anna to make sure they send the police. Once the ambulance, police and fire department arrive and Steven has been taken to theemergency department, Vera tries to describe to the police the events that led up to thestabbing. She tries to explain that her son didn't mean to hurt anybody, that he suffersfrom a mental illness and that he has also been drinking. But Vera is so upset and devas-tated over what has happened that she can barely speak. 166Crisis and emergency Activity 10-1: Reflecting on an escalating crisis Do you think there is anything John's family members could have done differently to have prevented a crisis in the first place ? Do you think there is anything John's family members could have done differently to prevent what had become a crisis from escalating into an emergency?167Crisis and emergency Being prepared Being prepared can help to prevent a situation from developing into a crisis and can also ease the person's pain and anxiety once a crisis does occur. John's family might think about the following: ensuring that John's doctor and day treatment program workers are aware of (a) his difficulties in coping with change, (b) how change affects him (he develops severeanxiety and depression), (c) how he copes with these feelings (he turns to alcohol toself-medicate) and (d) what happens when he drinks alcohol (he is unable to stop atone drink, and it only takes four or five drinks before he starts experiencing rage andparanoia; he often becomes violent and makes threats). determining that John's doctor and day treatment program workers are willing and able to work with both his mental health and substance use problems. ensuring that John's doctor and workers are helping him learn to cope with change in his life. finding a program that provides support and education for family members\u2014this can help John's family learn how to cope with conflict and crises more effectively andcan provide them with professional and peer support, experience and validation. starting to set limits to help John manage his feelings and behaviours. For example, to continue receiving an allowance from his parents, John must not avoid his responsi-bilities (such as attending his day program and keeping appointments with his doctor).John must smoke outside at all times to respect the health of his family members.John must use his allowance for necessary items such as clothes and bus fare, not foralcohol. John, like every member of the family, cannot be allowed to engage in threat-ening remarks or behaviours. When John is ready (and is in a calm frame of mind), the family can talk with him about his smoking and give him some information about ideas for quitting smoking, includinginformation about nicotine replacement therapy (such as the patch or nicotine gum). During a crisis When John does experience a crisis, the family should: try to be calm and supportive offer to call John's doctor or one of his day program workers and ask John if he wishes to talk with them on the phone if he is agreeable, offer to take John to his doctor's office or to his day program so that he can meet with one of his workers in person offer help and suggestions about what John can do to ease his anxiety and fear about whatever is concerning him. Once John returned home obviously drunk, angry, paranoid and demanding money from his mother, several things might have helped prevent this crisis from becoming 168Crisis and emergency an emergency: Vera was right in that it was too late to try to reason with John. Knowing his usual pat- tern of drinking alcohol to cope with conflict, and his routine of calming himself inhis room until he fell asleep, it would be better to avoid questioning John about whathe did with his allowance. Knowing that John always smoked cigarettes when he was intoxicated and feeling angry and paranoid, it might have helped for Vera to give him the ten dollars this time, sincehe was unlikely to respond very well to attempts at limit-setting when he was in crisis.When John is calmer, the family could talk to him about asking for money for ciga-rettes, and establish some ground rules. Vera could have accompanied him to the store to buy cigarettes (preferably with a third person, if John is agreeable), and then taken him home and given him time to calmdown in his room alone until he fell asleep (his usual pattern), while family membersmonitored his smoking and ensured that he did not unintentionally harm himself orfall asleep with a lit cigarette. Vera might have considered asking a close family friend to come over and help moni- tor John. Either Vera or another family member might have then phoned his doctor,therapist or another health professional who knows John and asked for help or adviceon how to proceed. When talking to John, Steven should have spoken more softly and avoided direct eye contact with him, since shouting, judging, accusing and blaming him increased hisfear and paranoia. Anna was wise to stay quiet and in the doorway. She knew from past incidents that when John was intoxicated, he was easily provoked into threatening behaviour. Toomany people \"cornering\" him could worsen an already precarious situation. Steven could have helped by: not crowding John when he was upset and intoxicated speaking softly and gently not making accusations avoiding direct eye contact with John, especially staring at him keeping a safe distance from John (this would have helped to keep Steven safe and prevent John from feeling more paranoid and \"imprisoned\") letting one person (in this case, his mother) speak to John and handle the conflict. Following through on these suggestions might have helped prevent a crisis from becom- ing an emergency. However, families should be aware that sometimes an emergency cannot be avoided. It is helpful to know what they can do in the event of an emergency. WHEN A CRISIS BECOMES AN EMERGENCY If your relative threatens to harm him- or herself or you, or to seriously damage prop- erty, you must do whatever is necessary to protect yourself and others (including your169Crisis and emergency relative) from harm. You may need to leave and call for help. This is advisable only under extreme circumstances, and only for very short periods of time. If possible,remove objects that your relative could use to harm him- or herself. Don't: shout criticize stare argue with others about what to do. Suicide One of the most terrifying aspects of a serious mental health disorder is talk of suicide. Any talk\u2014or even joking\u2014about suicide must be taken seriously. Most people do not want to end their lives. Suicidal thinking or attempts typically occur during a serious episode of mental illness when the person feels helpless, hopeless andin a state of despair. Although the feelings are often temporary, at the time, people donot believe that the feelings will pass. You can help by acknowledging your relative'sfeelings while offering to help him or her find other solutions. However, it is also impor-tant to recognize your own limitations. Family members must realize that they do not have absolute control to change things and cannot be responsible for all oftheir relative's actions. WARNING SIGNS OF SUICIDE There are several warning signs that a person is considering suicide. He or she may: discuss suicide and what it would be like to have things end be concerned with providing for children, other family members or pets give away possessions express feelings of worthlessness, such as, \"I'm no good to anybody\" feel hopeless about the future, reflected in comments such as, \"What's the use?\" talk about voices that tell him or her to do something dangerous. What to do if you find someone after a suicide attempt: Phone 911 immediately. If you know first aid, administer it immediately. Phone someone to accompany you to the hospital or to stay with you at home. Do not try to handle the crisis alone; contact a support group to help you with your immediate reactions and long-term feelings.170Crisis and emergency Getting treatment in an emergency GOING TO THE HOSPITAL It's best if you can get your relative to go to the hospital voluntarily. If he or she won't listen to you, ask someone your relative trusts to convince him or her to go to the hospital.This should be part of your prearranged action plan (see \"Creating an Emergency Plan,\"p. 174. Try to offer your relative a choice. For example, John's mother might have askedhim: \"Will you go to the hospital with me, or would you prefer to go with your father orAnna?\" This reduces a person's fear that he or she is being coerced. CALLING THE POLICE If your relative appears likely to endanger him- or herself or someone else, and refusesto see a doctor, you can get a judge or justice of the peace (depending on the provinceor territory in which you live) to issue a document that authorizes the police to take yourrelative to a hospital for an assessment. But if you're in a crisis or emergency situation(the danger is immediate), just call 911. Sometimes you have to phone the police, and the first time is really tough. I remember the first time we had to phone 911, and the ambulance came,and the police\u2014and then my neighbour who's a doctor came over andsaid, \"Is there anything I can do?\" And I had to say, and I remember Iactually got it out, \"My daughter is having a psychotic episode. And she'sbeen using crack.\" And once I got that out, he was very supportive\u2014and Iwas fine. I thought, OK, you know, that's behind me. So I told him, andhe was very kind. So once you put it out there, and nothing terrible hap-pens, you're OK. It's understandable that families are reluctant to call the police, but extreme circumstances may leave you no other choice. Often, merely telling the ill person that you are callingthe police will calm him or her down. When you call 911, tell the emergency operator that your relative needs emergency medical assistance and give the operator your relative's diagnosis. Say you need help getting him or her to the hospital. In some communities, the police are given training in crisis intervention. It's helpful to find out what kind of training, if any, the police in your community have so you'll knowin advance how much advocating you might have to do when and if you need to call onthem. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to call the police, write down theofficers' names, badge numbers and response time in case you later need to report anyconcerns about how the problem was handled. While the police are present, you mayhave time to call the doctor or any other emergency contact.171Crisis and emergency Even when your relative has been destructive or physically abusive, you may be reluc- tant to involve the police. Family members sometimes fear that their relative will be putin custody where they may be victimized and treated inappropriately. But failing to take seriously the risk of violence and physical harm can have its own consequences. You should take care to recognize the signs of escalating threats and vio-lence, and the presence of extra stress and triggers that could set your relative off, andknow when things are beyond your control. Don't be afraid to call a crisis team in toyour home or the police. In many cases that is the safest, kindest thing you can do foran ill family member. Involvement with the forensic mental health system Ironically, if a person with serious mental health conditions comes before a judge becausehe or she has been charged with doing something illegal, it may be more likely that per-son will be remanded for a full assessment and possibly treatment. Forensic psychiatry is a branch of mental health that works with people who have become involved with thelaw. For some individuals with mental health problems who have become involved withthe law, being directed to a forensic facility allows them to receive the care that theyhave not been able to receive in the community system. The forensic mental health system can be confusing for families. If you live in Ontario, The Forensic Mental Health System in Ontario: An Information Guide (available at www.camh.net/Publications/CAMH_Publications/forensic_menthealth_infoguide.html)will help you find your way through the system. WORKING WITH EMERGENCY ROOM STAFF If possible, go to the emergency department with your relative. The staff should interviewyou because you have information that they need to decide how to treat your relative. Ifthe emergency room staff don't ask to talk to you, you should insist that you get a chanceto talk to them. Try to provide an organized account of the events leading up to the hospital visit. If you are worried about your safety should your relative be released, let the staff know. INVOLUNTARY ADMISSIONS In some cases, your relative may not want to get treatment after a crisis, or even afterhaving serious symptoms. In Canada, people can't be forced to get treatment for a men-tal health disorder unless they are a threat to themselves or others. While this approachdoes acknowledge the rights of the individual, it has created complex problems for fami-lies. If a person who doesn't want to be admitted to hospital is admitted, he or she isconsidered an involuntary patient. The specific criteria used to decide whether a person172Crisis and emergency can be admitted to the hospital without his or her consent vary from province to province. The basic principles are: The person is believed to be a danger to him- or herself (e.g., is suicidal or self-harming). The person is believed to be a danger to others (e.g., is violent). The person is unable to care for him- or herself and is at immediate risk as a result (e.g., because he or she is not eating or drinking). If the person meets the provincial criteria for involuntary admission, a physician can issue a document that authorizes a short stay in the hospital (in most provinces, one tothree days) for emergency treatment. In some provinces, another document must beissued if longer-term treatment is needed. Consenting to treatment People who have been admitted to hospital involuntarily still have the right to makedecisions about their treatment if they are mentally capable to do so. This includesrefusing treatment. To be considered capable, a person must: be competent to give consent have the intellectual capacity to make the decision give the consent voluntarily have enough information to make an informed decision, including information on potential risks or side-effects of treatment. If the person is not able to give informed consent, then he or she must be declared incom- petent. Someone is appointed to make decisions on the person's behalf. In some provinces, the decision-maker is a family member while others use people appointed by the state. 173Crisis and emergency Information about the Mental Health Act Each province has its own Mental Health Act, so the rules vary from province to province. Provincial offices of the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA)and websites of provincial ministries of health are sources of information. Hereare some useful links: Alberta The Mental Health Act of Alberta: A Guide for Consumers and Caregivers(available online through CMHA Alberta) British Columbia BC's Mental Health Act in Plain Language(available online through CMHA BC) Manitoba www.gov.mb.ca/health/mh/act.html New Brunswick www.ahsc.health.nb.ca/Programs/MentalHealth/rights.shtml Ontario Rights and Responsibilities: Mental Health and the Lawwww.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/mental/rights.html Prince Edward Island Islanders Guide to the Mental Health Actwww.gov.pe.ca/publications/getpublication.php3?number=118 Quebec Mental Illness: A Regional Handbook for Families(available from CMHA Quebec) Saskatchewan www.health.gov.sk.ca/rr_your_prsnl_rights_mhsa.html174Crisis and emergency CREATING AN EMERGENCY PLAN Before a situation turns into a crisis or an emergency, it may help to sit down with your family and discuss what you would do in an emergency. Don't try to deal with your fam-ily member when he or she appears to be under the influence of alcohol or other drugs,or when family members are extremely upset. You may say things under the stress ofthe situation that you don't mean, or take action that just makes things worse. When everyone is calm, you can focus on planning what to do if: the family notices that some of the symptoms of the substance use or mental health problem are reoccurring the situation has already become a crisis. Developing a plan together ensures that your relative is an active participant in his or her own care. Planning all of this before a crisis happens can sometimes help avoid acrisis altogether. However, there are times when a crisis may not be preventable. CREATING A CRISIS PLAN The following guidelines will help you create a crisis action plan that is tailored to theneeds of your ill family member: Make sure that your relative is actively involved and participates in the discussion and in all decisions, and that his or her preferences are heard and respected. Involve as many members of your family as deemed appropriate and develop an approach that all can agree on. Generate a number of possible crisis plans and act on the ones that everyone, especially your ill loved one, agrees are the best ones. Develop specific steps for carrying out your plans. Decide what role each member will have in implementing the plan. For example, decide who is the best person to accom-pany your loved one to the hospital, should this become necessary, who should stayon at the hospital, and who should make phone calls from home. Decide who will speak to the treatment team or, in extreme situations, to the police, if your relative is unable to speak for him- or herself. Make sure to get your relative's permission to relate particular information to hospital staff or to the police.175Crisis and emergency Crisis cards People with concurrent disorders and their family members have found it extremely helpful to write important information on a card or a piece of paper folded small enoughso that it can be carried with them wherever they go. For example, the card or paper maybe placed in a visible part of the person's wallet. A crisis card usually contains information important for others (e.g., friends, health care workers, police, strangers) to have in the event that your relative experiences a mentalhealth or substance use-related crisis while away from home. It contains informationsuch as: important phone numbers\u2014who to call in the event of a crisis or an emergency, including who to call first and who to call as a back-up the person's mental health or addiction professional (e.g., psychiatrist, therapist or worker) the person's family doctor the hospital or treatment centre at which the person has currently or previously been involved in inpatient or outpatient care a list of the person's current medications, the proper dosage for each, and the times of day or night that they are to be taken (you may also wish to include the name andnumber of the pharmacy at which the prescriptions are usually filled) a list of medications to which the person is allergic any medications used in the past for either the mental health or the substance use problem that did not work, or that the person would not take due to side-effects (youmay list such medications in one column and list the side-effects in a second column) tips for effectively talking to and working with the person when he or she is in crisis - neutral topics of interest to them- comforting foods- self-calming measures, such as music or video games.176Crisis and emergency Activity 10-2: Creating a crisis card Here are some suggestions for information that you might include on a crisis card.

Key factors in recoveryRecovery182Recovery WHAT IS RECOVERY? Recovery is a one-of-a-kind journey for each person with its own rewards and perils along the way. There is no one definition of recovery, and no single way to measure it.All definitions of recovery share a focus on developing new meaning and purpose in lifeas people grow beyond the impact of mental illness and substance use. When I first started in the family support group, I found myself listening to other family members who were doing really well and had been in situa-tions similar to my own. So it's the hope\u2014it's the giving of hope, that itreally is possible to get through it; that no matter how tough it's been andhow often the treatment has failed, that it still may one day succeed, thatrecovery is possible. And no matter how many people turn away from you,or what they think of you, things will get better. Recovery has been referred to as a process, an outlook, a vision and a guiding principle. Recovery has also been described as a process by which people recover their self-esteem,dreams, self-worth, empowerment, pride, dignity and meaning. For professionals andfamilies, recovery is about treating the whole person: identifying their strengths, instill-ing hope, helping them to function by helping them take responsibility for their lives. Activity 11-1: What does recovery mean to me? As a family member, loved one, friend or significant other of someone with con-current substance use and mental health disorders, my definition of recovery is:183Recovery Recovery is also about refusing to settle for less. A positive way of looking at recovery is to embrace the humanity of people and their potential for change. People are people before they are diagnoses, or cases, clients or consumers. They are not defined or con-trolled by their symptoms. People should be encouraged to: have hope for change form meaningful connections with others who understand their situation set their own goals nurture their interests and learn new skills develop self-awareness about aspects of their own illness and behaviour. Recovery is defined by a belief in one's self. It is nurtured by the kindness, understand- ing, compassion and respect of friends, family and others who are significant in one'slife. Ultimately, recovery involves sharing and gaining support from others. Recovery: doesn't necessarily move in one direction; recovery implies learning from setbacks and having the courage to move forward in spite of them may occur even when symptoms are present; recovery does not necessarily mean that people will never again experience symptoms, go through hard times or relapse is facilitated by access to a support system, but it can occur without the intervention of mental health professionals must also involve attending to other areas of life, such as work, leisure time, life goals and dealing with stigma. Relapse can be part of the overall recovery process. It is important to use setbacks or relapses as valuable learning opportunities. KEY FACTORS IN RECOVERY For people with concurrent disorders to achieve and maintain recovery, they need to: be treated as unique and important be treated as human being with goals and dreams have the freedom to make choices and decisions about their lives be treated with dignity and respect accept that their unique journey through life has taken a different path recognize that recovery is the potential to become free of symptoms by following an individualized treatment plan acknowledge that relapse is a common and expected part of recovery, but does not mean that they have \"failed\" or that previous gains are lost\u2014rather, it is a chance tolearn and to move forward again184Recovery have hope about their future (see \"The role of hope,\" p. 185) have meaningful relationships with others who care and do not stigmatize (see \"The role of family,\" p. 190) have a routine and structure to their day marked by meaningful activities that may or may not include work (paid or volunteer) have a reliable and steady source of income live in stable, clean and comfortable housing, whether it is an independent living situation or supportive housing accept that recovery may require a structured community day treatment program or other links to professional mental health and addiction systems of care recognize that pets may be important recognize that spirituality or religious beliefs and practices may be important. It seems to me that people reject the sick when there's little hope that they'll get better. Why invest time and energy if a person will very likely remain illfor the rest of their lives? But it's not true of most people with concurrentdisorders, provided they are caught early enough and receive good care. Myson is working now, he has a girlfriend . . . and it certainly didn't look likehe would have any kind of a normal life five years ago when he was diag-nosed with schizophrenia and drug abuse. So I tend to believe there's a lotof hope out there. Activity 11-2: What does recovery mean to my relative? What elements might be particularly important for your loved one's recovery? Tryto be as specific as possible. (For example, he or she might understand the pur-pose of medications and made the decision to take them; engage in meaningfulactivity each day, such as attending self-help groups, working, volunteering, seeingfriends; have specific goals, plans and hope for the future.) 185Recovery The role of hope I think as family members we have an opportunity to offer a lot of hope to other families going through the same thing. The general public seems tothink that once a doctor tells you your family member has a mental illnessor a problem with drugs and alcohol, it's over\u2014like, there's no hope; theirlives are destroyed and yours too. But it's so different now, so many peoplerecover from concurrent disorders. And look at the research, the new medica-tions and treatments\u2014there have been so many advances. I know so manyparents whose kids have gone back to university or have jobs\u2014I mean,they're doing well. Mental illness and substance abuse doesn't have to meanthat the person's life is over. So I think we need to give some hope to people. There is great hope for people who have concurrent disorders. Over the past 10 years, many improvements have occurred, including: improved medications improved understanding of treatment needs increased opportunities for learning from others. A diagnosis of both a mental health and substance use disorder does not mean that a person will inevitably decline and be unable to function. On the other hand, recoverydoes not necessarily mean that a person's previous abilities and situation will be com-pletely restored or that they won't need medications or other treatment. The overarching message of \"recovery\" is that hope and a meaningful life are possible. Hope is recognized as one of the most important determinants of recovery. Patricia Deegan of the U.S. National Empowerment Council says: For those of us who have been diagnosed with mental illness . . . hope is not just a nice sounding euphemism. It is a matter of life and death . . . Wehave known a very cold winter in which all hope seemed to be crushed outof us. It came like a thief in the night and robbed us of our youth, ourdreams, our aspirations and our futures. It came upon us like a terrifyingnightmare that we could not awaken from. \u2014Deegan, 1993186Recovery Inspirational quotes If you have ever spoken with someone who has benefited from a 12-step program such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-Anon, you may have heard about the \"recovery slogans\"that thousands of people have said were important contributors to their recovery journeys. Many family members affected by mental health and/or substance use problems have also found similar kinds of slogans (sayings and quotes) to be inspirational, motivatingand enormously beneficial. What is it about these little sayings or quotes that make them so powerfully memorable and effective that they can help people actually change how they think, feel and behave?They can be thought of as \"bits of wisdom written in shorthand.\" Many of them, in amere one or two lines, can shift a person's entire perspective on particular aspects of life. For example, consider the following quote: \"I haven't failed. I've identified 10,000 ways this doesn't work.\" \u2014Thomas Edison Thinking about a quote such as this (and even better, discussing it with people who care\u2014what the quote means, how it gives you a new way to look at things in your life,how thinking this new way would be really useful and helpful for you) can help youfocus on the positive aspects of a situation. Quotes, slogans and sayings can help people change their attitudes and behaviours so they are less affected by the opinions and actions of others. In these ways and in so manyothers, these little pearls of wisdom are guides to peace that can have a powerfully bene-ficial effect on a person's emotional health. As such, they can help to build resilience(see Chapter 5) and reduce a person's vulnerability to developing compassion fatigue (seeChapter 4).187Recovery Activity 11-3: Wisdom written in shorthand Think about each of the following quotes and sayings, and write down what they mean to you. There is no right or wrong way to interpret them. This exercise isdesigned to offer you different ways to cope, both as a family member affected byconcurrent disorders and in your own personal life. If you share your pain, you cut it in half; if you don't, you double it. You can't direct the wind, but you can adjust the sails. This too shall pass. A journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step. If you find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesn't lead anywhere. 188Recovery Fall seven times, stand up eight (Japanese proverb). You are responsible for the effort, not the outcome. Act as if . . . Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do. Do you have any favourite quotes or sayings of your own? If so, jot some of these down in the space provided and think about why they are so important to youand how they help you to get through each day:189Recovery We have summarized some of our thoughts on a few of the quotes, just to get you started. You can't direct the wind, but you can adjust the sails. This quote is about learning to accept the things we can't control and to try to changethose things we do have some control over, such as our own actions and behaviours,and sometimes even our thoughts, moods and perceptions. Learning this valuable les-son in life may very well be one of the keys to serenity and contentment. We're responsible for the effort, not the outcome. Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do. These two quotes centre on one important theme: It is much more helpful and realistic to concentrate your efforts on what you actually do have control over, rather than expendtime and energy trying to make a change in something over which you have no control.For example, it is helpful to support family members in their struggle to stop or reducethe use of substances, as long as you understand and accept the fact that only they areultimately responsible for their own recovery. This too shall pass. When you find yourself in the middle of a crisis or caught in the grip of distressing feel-ings or situations, it can feel like the experience will never end and that you won't beable to survive it. Sometimes the only way to get through extremely stressful and adversesituations in life is to keep in mind one simple truth: Nothing lasts forever. Act as if . . . For some people, trying to change their thoughts and feelings before they change theirbehaviours may not get them very far in their recovery. Waiting until you feel moremotivated and less anxious before trying out new recovery behaviours can lead to aworsening of both the substance use and the mental health problems. More motiva-tion and reduced anxiety won't happen if you stick to the same behaviours every daythat allow the lack of motivation and anxiety to flourish. Sometimes, people have totake action in spite of feeling depression, anxiety, worry, shame, anger and exhaustion,and in spite of struggling with problematic thoughts and beliefs. So it might be helpful to live by one rule . . . act as if you are feeling great and thinking rationally. In otherwords, no matter what else is going on inside your own head or outside in the world, follow through on your commitments and your recovery plan (e.g., go to AA meetings, keep appointments with your therapist, eat three nutritious meals every day, get eighthours sleep every night). You will have to force yourself at first, but if you can act as if things are better, you'll actually help that come true.190Recovery The role of family Not only should family members be included in discussions about recovery\u2014they can actually share the road to recovery. Many elements considered important for your loved one's recovery may overlap with your own journey of recovery. Some of these might include: having hope about your own and your relative's future being educated about your loved one's mental illness and substance use disorder and understanding how these problems interact having supportive relationships with others in the family and community who are car- ing and do not judge or stigmatize feeling a sense of connection to people who are important to you being considered a knowledgeable, engaged and respected part of your loved one's health care team, and being kept informed by health care professionals accepting that your loved one's journey through life has taken a new course understanding that if relapses occur it does not mean that your relative has \"failed\" or lost previous gains viewing relapses as a chance to help your family member get back on his or her path to recovery feeling a sense of control and personal mastery over your own life learning to let go of the all-encompassing preoccupation with your ill loved one and allowing yourself to have a life of your own, with meaningful and relaxing time toyourself to engage in activities that are pleasurable, stress-relieving and fulfilling, andlearning to do so without anxiety or guilt recognizing that strong spiritual, philosophical or religious beliefs or practices may help you sustain yourself through difficult times. When people meet my son now, everybody is just so flabbergasted. And I think he offers such hope to sufferers and families . . . and people tend towant to talk to you about it. And we try. We try to help families wheneverwe can. And I think we give them a lot of hope. We get a number of fami-lies calling us over the course of a year. And either a social worker or doctoror somebody from the family support group\u2014they've used our family as anexample and say, \"their son is doing so well\"\u2014and then families say,\"Can we come over and visit you?\" and they come over and talk to my son.So we try to help. We try to give hope to other families.191Recovery A family journey of recovery My dad was treated for alcohol problems when he was 64 years old. By then I was seriously questioning the effects of my Dad's illness on me as wife and mother. I was concerned about the genetic, familial predisposition to addiction and mentalillness and how it might impact on my children. My mother and I sought out Al-Anon where we discovered that we were not alone in our search for direction regarding shame-based thinking and powerlessness overa loved one's addiction. We heard about the necessity of practising self-esteemand maintaining boundaries. However, many times while dealing with my adoles-cent and teenaged children, I found myself caught in a trap where my inability tosay 'No!' made me question my parenting skills. As a child I avoided confronta-tion, hid anger and disappointment, and ran from conflict. This behaviour affordedme quietude but an inability to verbalize my emotions. Our eldest son struggled with alcohol dependency between the ages of 19 and 23. We strongly encouraged and supported him through treatment at an inpatientfacility (he stayed only three weeks). Although haunted by angry emotional out-bursts in his early 20s, he succeeded in maintaining sobriety, facing his demonswith honesty, courage and faith. My husband and I supported him financially, whennecessary, and always communicated our love to him and our confidence in himas a special person. I was determined that I would shield my other children fromexploring any form of addictive drug. I kept reading about substance abuse. I alsotook a course in assertiveness training that gave me confidence to believe inmyself, stand firm in my beliefs and voice my feelings. Our seventh child, a gregarious, bright, talented, honest, well-loved person, sank into depression at the age of 18. Over the next few years he struggled to avoid tak-ing medication while seeking professional psychological help, attempting universitystudies as well as actively seeking out human relationships that most often failedhim. He was plagued with suicidal thoughts, inability to cope with studies, and wasunable to manage occupational work hours, all the while attempting to 'keep face.'He and I kept in close touch and we often had 'emergency meetings over coffee'when he felt that he couldn't carry on. But he would pluck up his courage and try again. At age 21, after a suicidal episode, he was admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of depression with suicidal tendencies. He began antidepressant therapy that relieved his anxiety and increased his energy output so that he could continue university while living at home. Soon stress mounted; he found home too confining and hewent to live downtown with friends in an environment where he felt comfortable.Once again he discontinued his studies. I was anxious when he left home but I 192Recovery knew that he must walk his own journey. His brothers and sisters kept in touch with him and he faithfully called his dad and me. My husband, through all this,often remarked to me how he admired his son's courage in facing these hardmoments in his life. And my son often said to me, in moments of desperation,'Mom, no matter what happens to me, promise me that you will never blameyourself. You have been the best mother. I take responsibility for my life and howI am living it.' My prayer for him continued to be: 'Lord, you love this child of yours even better than I can. I know you will take care of him.' Two years later he succumbed to the temptation of street drugs in the hope of regain-ing lost energy and experiencing a more manageable life. Cocaine, crystal meth andmarijuana, his drugs of choice, were at first exciting but within a few months, his lifecareened to a debilitating crash. His brothers, sisters and a cousin encouraged him to return home. They all knew he was desperate and could not manage on his own. Humi-liation, guilt and his loss of independence were his major concerns. We are told to haveself-reliance but that is tricky when one has no self to rely on. My husband and I and our niece, a close friend of our son, attended an introduc-tion to addiction and recovery program that helped us face the challenge beforeus. Our son always supported our need to learn coping skills and we shared insightswith him and the other family members who were eager to share in the recoveryprocess of their beloved brother. We learned that lapses can be oppor- tunities for growth. We must concentrate on love rather than fear and judgment. At this time our son has been 'clean' for one year since the completion of a six-week inpatient treatment and follow-up program for concurrent disorders. He continuesantidepressant medication under supportive medical care and has a full-time job.He also has a meaningful relationship and hopes to return to university this year. He is socially active and very grateful for each day. Recovery (finding self and gaining control) is an ongoing life challenge. At some time on our journey, we all face grief, disappointment and loss. Each day bringsits own challenges. Regaining control can only be accomplished when the painfrom lost dreams is faced honestly in a safe, understanding setting. With concur-rent mental health and addiction issues, the challenge is two-fold. We were greatly helped by the open communication we shared with our son. He triedso hard to be affable and grateful even at the worst of times. He would stay talkingand listening as long as he could and then retreat into the silences of his despair. Atthis time of his greatest need, we tried to be for him the beacon in the lighthouse. One important factor in my recovery is self-care. Each day I ask myself, 'What do I needtoday and how can I accomplish this?' I have learned that, in recovery, I must not only beconscious of my own needs but I must verbalize them and take action to achieve them.193Recovery Activity 11-4: Your recovery journey What elements might be particularly important for your own journey of recovery as the family member of a person with concurrent disorders? Try to be as spe-cific as possible. (For example, maybe you would understand and accept yourfamily member's illnesses, be able to let go of guilt and move forward with yourown life goals and dreams, reconnect with friends and return to enjoyableleisurely activities.) 194Recovery Activity 11-5: Recovery Attitudes Questionnaire The Recovery Attitudes Questionnaire (RAQ-16) was developed by a team of con- sumers, service providers and researchers at the Hamilton County Recovery Initiative(Borkin et al, 2000). The RAQ-16 consists of 16 questions designed to help you identity and think about your own beliefs and attitudes about recovery from concurrent disorders.There are no right or wrong answers. After you finish the questionnaire, readthrough the comments about each question that follow. They are meant to helpyou reflect on your responses. Try to complete the questionnaire before readingthe comments. Recovery is a process and experience that we all share. People face the challenge of recovery when they experience the crises of life, such as the death of a loved one,divorce, physical disabilities and serious mental illnesses. Successful recovery does notchange the fact that the experience has occurred, that the effects are still present, andthat one's life has changed forever. Rather, successful recovery means that the personhas changed, and that the meaning of these events to the person has also changed.They are no longer the primary focus of the person's life (Anthony, 1993).

People who are in recovery need the support of others. Feeling a sense of connection to people, such as other family members, friends and professionals, is very important to re-create a sense of belonging and close-ness. We humans are social beings. We are most content and fulfilled whenengaged in mean ingful relationships with others. Support from people who are non-judgmental, compassionate and who accept concurrent disorders as legiti-mate illnesses from which a person can recover is crucial to the recovery of bothconsumers and their families. 2. Recovering from mental illness is possible no matter what you think may cause it. Concurrent disorders are generally a result of a complex mix of hereditary, genetic, biological, psychological and social factors. However, people can sometimes holdmistaken beliefs about the causes of these disorders. This journey of recovery maytake different paths and look very different from person to person, but yes, it is a definite possibility regardless of one's beliefs about the causes. 3. A good understanding of one's mental illness helps in recovery. The experience of mental illness is often filled with fear and anxiety, grief and loss, altered expectations and dramatic changes in one's perception of oneself as a humanbeing. These feelings increase when a substance use disorder is also involved. For manypeople with concurrent disorders and their families, becoming educated about con-current disorders is essential for gaining a sense of control over these conditions andfor recovery. It's important to learn about the signs, symptoms and effects of mentalhealth and substance use disorders, possible causes, treatment methods, and the possi-bility for recovery. 4. To recover requires faith. \"Faith\" holds many meanings. Some people may think that believing in a higher being or following a particular religion is necessary for recovery. However, for manypeople, \"faith\" may simply mean believing in yourself, having hope for a better futureand believing in the people around you who care about you and want to help you. 196Recovery Comments about each question are provided below. You may not agree with all of them. They are included simply as a way to help you think about the differentideas of recovery.197Recovery 5. Recovery can occur even if symptoms are present. Recovery from concurrent disorders doesn't necessarily mean that people will never again experience symptoms, go through hard times or relapse. Recovery implies learn-ing from these experiences and having the courage to move forward in spite of them.Many people reach their goals and realize their dreams even if they have setbacksalong the way. 6. People in recovery sometimes have setbacks. As discussed above, people with concurrent disorders will likely have setbacks from time to time. This is not a sign of failure, but an opportunity to learn about poten-tial triggers and sources of stress, and perhaps new and more effective ways to managedifficult aspects of life. 7. People differ in the way they recover from a mental illness. \"Recovery\" means different things to different people. Some may recognize the impor- tance of psychiatric medication for their recovery, while others may need more inten-siveongoing support from health care professionals. Some people want to return to work, while others find work too stressful and become involved in self-help groupsor other community support activities. Some people hold on to strong spiritual beliefs,while others find that simply enjoying the company of a pet or close friend sustainsthem. No two people recover in the same way. 8. Recovering from mental illness can occur without help from mental health professionals. Many people in recovery from concurrent disorders will have contact with health care professionals at some point. Finding and working with compassionate and understand-ing health care professionals who respect clients' unique needs and goals is often veryimportant to beginning the journey of recovery and to maintaining the gains that onemakes. This contact with professionals may be intensive and continuous, as some clientsmay be part of supportive outpatient programs or have the ongoing help of a communitycase manager. Some clients may see a physician only once in a while, to obtain prescrip-tions for psychiatric medications. The type of contact may also change over time. Aspeople become stronger and more comfortable in managing their illnesses and theirdaily lives, they may have less involvement with professionals and eventually may wishto stop seeing them, except in cases of relapse or more difficult times. Some people recover without the services of health care professionals. They may havemilder forms of mental illness and may be able to reduce or control their problematicsubstance use so that these problems do not significantly disrupt their lives. Some inthis group find that attending self-help groups and maintaining close and supportiverelationships with family and friends is enough for them to enjoy a life of recovery.198Recovery 9. All people with serious mental illnesses can strive for recovery. Yes. Any person with mental health (and substance use disorders) can work toward a life of recovery. Each person has the capacity for hope, for a sense of acceptanceand belonging, and for goals and dreams. 10. People who recover from mental illness were not really mentally ill in the first place. The old belief in the chronic and hopeless nature of mental illness and substance use problems has been challenged. The fact is that people with concurrent disor-ders can enter a life of recovery that involves emotional stability, good physicalhealth, meaningful social and work-related activities and close, supportive relation-ships. It is no longer true that people with serious mental illnesses and substanceuse problems are on a downward course to chronic disability. People with very serious forms of mental illness and substance use disorders can indeed recover. 11. The recovery process requires hope. Hope involves believing in your ability to overcome difficulties and looking to the future with optimism that recovery is possible. Having hope is considered funda-mental to achieving and maintaining a life of recovery. 12. Recovery does not mean going back to the way things used to be. Some people who are in recovery may be able to return to their former activities, such as the same jobs, school, friends and social interests. On the other hand, recov-ery does not necessarily mean going back to exactly the same activities, beliefs andoverall lives as in the past. For many people, being in recovery often involves estab-lishing a new and different or altered set of goals and dreams\u2014a different job, adifferent school, new friends and social interests. People may find that their priori-ties have changed dramatically from the way they used to think. 13. Stigma associated with mental illness can slow the recovery process. Stigma and discrimination can have devastating and destructive consequences for those with concurrent disorders and their families. Stigma and discrimination candefinitely act as major obstacles to recovery. Stigma can make people lose confi-dence in themselves, undermine their attempts to reintegrate into the communityand, in some cases, can even lead to such despair that a relapse occurs. It can alsocause families to isolate themselves from others and feel shame and embarrassment.199Recovery 14. Recovering from the consequences of mental illness is sometimes more difficult than recovering from the illness itself. The consequences of mental illness or substance use can vary dramatically. Some people may experience milder consequences, such as short leaves from school orwork, taking medications or being hospitalized for a short time. Others may experi-ence significant effects that might include jeopardized family relationships, loss ofmeaningful people in their lives, frequent and lengthy hospitalizations, inability towork or attend school, involvement in the legal system, medical problems, and so on.Once a person has become emotionally, mentally and physically stable, the personmay have to deal with these consequences. This can cause more stress and anxiety,and possibly lead to despair, a sense of failure and relapse. This is why it is impor-tant to remember that recovery involves paying attention to the whole person\u2014allof his or her needs, all areas of the person's life that have been affected. These canall be included in a comprehensive recovery plan. 15. The family may need to recover from the impact of a loved one's mental illness. Ideally, this chapter will have helped you realize the importance of recovery for your- self as well. We have discussed the effects of concurrent disorders on family members,ranging from physical to emotional, social, occupational, economic and spiritual. It is very important for family members to allow themselves to recover their sense of emotional stability, feelings of control, peace of mind and an overall sense ofwell-being as they experience the effects of concurrent disorders. 16. To recover requires courage. Having the courage to move forward in life despite experiencing the effects of both a substance use and a mental health problem is fundamental to the idea of recovery.Every seemingly small step forward, from getting out of bed in the morning, to get-ting through the day without using drugs, taking the bus to a community supportprogram, calling up a friend, taking medications, going back to work, etc., requiresmore courage than most of us could ever imagine trying to muster.

Families need help to deal with the impact of concurrent disorders, but familiesare also a key to finding effective solutions. A Family Guide to Concurrent Disorders is based on the collection of materials that was developed for a family support and education group at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. Part I is an overview of concurrent disorders, an introduction to treatment options and information about substance use problems, mental health problems and how they interact. Part II focuses on the impact of concurrent disorders on family life. It includes information on self-care strategies for family members and understanding and coping with the effects of stigma. Part III explores treatment and support for people affected by concurrent disorders. It includes strategies for navigating the mental health and substance use treatment systems, informationabout psychosocial and medication treatment options, recognizing and planning for relapses,and anticipating and coping with crisis situations. Part IV talks about the journey to recovery.
