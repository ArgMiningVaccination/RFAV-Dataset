MINDSET is the conscious and unconscious choices we make about the way we think and what we believe, our awareness and expectations, and our attitude and outlook. Here in the Brain Body Mind Lab, we are driven to discover innovative treatments incorporating how mindset works in synergy with Brain-Body-Mind to help recovery, healing, function, empowerment, self-image, and with that, quality of life. We all experience challenges related to our health at some point in our lives which affects our bodies, brains and our minds. Medical professionals have been successful at solving problems associated with acute disease. However, issues associated with chronic disease and chronic pain management have proven to be more challenging. Consequently, many patients receiving conventional care are additionally turning to complementary and integrative approaches. As various complementary and integrative approaches gain wider acceptance, it is important to better understand how they work, and subsequently identify patients who would benefit most from complementary and integrative approaches used in conjunction with conventional care. Examples of our areas of interest: - The effect of cognitive multisensory rehabilitation (focused on body awareness and quality of movement) to improve sensory and motor recovery in people with stroke - Develop outcome measures to assess body awareness and quality of movement of the upper limb in people with stroke - Improve outcome measurements for body awareness and body image - Investigate how Qigong practice mediates changes brain function and affects overall health in people with chronic diseases and chronic pain - Identify how a change in mindset causes changes in brain function and affects overall health in people with chronic diseases. \"All revolutionary changes are unthinkable until they happen, and then they are understood to be inevitable.\" - Theodore Roszak This is a new frontier in rehabilitation.
