It had been another long night in ceremony. My stomach muscles ached from hours of purging all the 'emotional yuck' that had resided inside of me for who knows how long. It didn't matter. All I know is that it was out. I was fatigued. I felt like I had experienced a thousand lifetimes while sitting on my yoga mat in a small hut in the middle of the Amazon. I could still see some people clutched by Grandmother Ayahuasca - a hallucinogenic plant-medicine brew, used by Amazonian Shamans to cure mental, physical, emotional and spiritual illnesses. It had been five hours since we drank the thick, dark Ayahuasca brew. But I could still hear the quiet sobs, the deep breathing, the sound of the rattle as the Ayahuascaro continued to 'cleanse' someone who was gasping for air and writhing in pain. This was the third night. There were two more nights of healing to go. Was this the only way? Was this the only way to crack myself open and usher in that core healing I knew was there. It was 2007, and I found myself completely dying to my old self in the Peruvian Amazon. I had unknowingly embarked on my own personal journey to discover core healing. What was core healing? Over the next few years, I would spend my time 'deep' in personal work - family constellations, Jungian shadow work therapy, breath work, Andean Shamanism, Kriya yoga, visits to John of God in Brazil and countless other energy work. For energy practitioners, the 'pot of gold' at the end of the rainbow is getting to a client's core issue. For most people, core healing is elusive. It's an ongoing journey of peeling away the \"onion layers\" of what comprises a human being. It is very rare to come across a tool that directly goes to the core - especially in a 20-minute session. But that is what I discovered in 2011. At the time, I was acting director of the Oasis Therapy Center at Hippocrates Health Institute in West Palm Beach, Florida. We were an island onto ourselves and worked with 50 amazing practitioners who specialized in unique modalities, such as Chi Nei Tsang, hands-on healing, didgeridoo sound healing and Theragem, a fusion light technology utilizing crystals and healing frequencies to bring about homeostasis on an emotional, mental, physical and spiritual level. We brought in Catharina Jansma, the CEO of [Medica Health](https://medicahealth.org/), to train and certify our staff on Theragem. During the three-day training, we learned about the Assemblage Point. I had come across that term while reading the books of Carlos Castaneda's teachings of Don Juan. [The Theragem's Assemblage Point was to become for me the missing link of core healing.](https://medicahealth.org/crystal-light-therapy/assemblage-point/) The Missing Link \"Everything you think and everything you feel depends on the position of the Assemblage Point.\" - Don Juan Anthropologist, shaman and author Carlos Castaneda was the first to introduce the Assemblage Point through the teachings of his mentor Don Juan Matus, a Yaquis shaman from Mexico. The bizarre, extensive training Castaneda recounts in his many books, introduces the shaman's blow as one way to dislodge the Assemblage Point. Scientists started researching the validity of the concept of the Assemblage Point and some believe that it is the epicentre of the physical and energy bodies of the human being. The Assemblage Point is visible with infrared imaging during tests with an electronic galvanometer where energy on the skin was measured, Jansma said. The spot where the human Assemblage Point lies shows 500 percent more energy than the skin directly surrounding it. The Assemblage Point appears like a luminous ball of energy and is found at the centre of the chest. It determines how we perceive and interact with the world. The condition of our physical, emotional and psychological state of being is also determined by the position of our Assemblage Point. Almost like a radio dial, the Assemblage Point's position determines what kind of information we take in from the world outside. If it is knocked off centre, due to trauma, it can have serious health consequences for an individual, like depression or bipolar disorder, etc. During Green's four-year tenure at Hippocrates, she witnessed countless energetic and physical shifts take place on guests just from 20-minute sessions with the Theragem. \"We had such a fertile ground here at Hippocrates because every guest on our Life Transformation program received a Theragem treatment three times,\" Green said. I literally saw thousands of people change within a 20-minute period time from an agitated state to a relaxed and peaceful state.\" \"People were hurting not just physically but emotionally dealing with difficult issues. After a session, they would get up from their tables, and their whole demeanour would change. They were relaxed and felt more balanced. For most people, feeling relaxed was a new feeling for them.\" The Assemblage Point The Assemblage Point is in a grid of luminous fibres. It is a vortex that houses not only our own individual awareness, but connects us to the ONE consciousness. By shifting the Assemblage Point, it registers different luminous bands of information and these bands, or strings of information, are constantly streaming from the universe. The position of the Assemblage Point determines our reality. It produces a certain feeling and thinking associated with its location. In Castaneda's books about Don Juan, he recounts how his teacher was able at will to shift his Assemblage Point to different areas of his luminous body and able to morph into an elderly man or animal. For the ordinary human being well-being and good health is found in the centre position of the chest. It can shift position however due to stress, emotional traumas, violence, giving birth, accidents, as well as drug use (illegal and legal). Dr A Blaen of the Assemblage Point Association in UK has done extensive research in Assemblage Point and its implications, conducted studies of what symptoms people feel when the Assemblage Point is found in different positions. For example if you are always anxious, stressed or panicked, your Assemblage Point is located by your right collar bone/shoulder area. If you suffer from anger, fatigue or depression, your Assemblage Point is located below your centre chest position on the right side of your body. Much of this mapping research shows that the location often forms similarities with depleted energetic and emotional states of organs described as in Traditional Chinese Medicine. The Assemblage Point Reconnection offers hope to all of those who suffer from any imbalance. As the Theragem Fusion Light Therapy is aimed at the person's energy field, during the Assemblage Point Reconnection process it will heighten all senses of the person. The sense will open up to receive more information, smell for example will be enhanced, hence a proper approach in a quiet dedicated room will prove to be a great transitional asset. With this preparation of gentleness, respect for the patient will help them literally illuminate their darkened areas resolving many emotional stuck issues. Theragem Fusion Light Therapy Theragem fuses scattered light with pulsed electromagnetic frequencies structured with colours, and the essence of precious gems and crystals to produce it an optimum homeostasis. Electromagnetic energy exists within everything - from our bodies to the Earth itself - and so by pulsing energy at different frequency rates and by combining natural healing frequencies with colour, pure metals, light and gemstones, Theragem can effectively increase the health of the body's cells, organs and glands. It does this at a level that is many times more powerful than using these methods in isolation, providing effective and rapid results. \"Theragem effectively treats the root cause of imbalances in the mind, body and spirit, before moving onto the symptoms,\" Jansma said. At the Tree of Health (Dove Center for Integral Medicine, Redwood Village, Aptos, California), they have been using Theragem for several years and for the past year incorporated Assemblage Point Reconnection. Corrina McFarlane, Theragem CLT practitioner at Tree of Health, said the Assemblage Point is a phenomenon in our world. \"We are riding this wave, even as we work the edge of the seen and unseen with regard to electromagnetic fields(EMFs),\" McFarlane said. \" It demands a quality of attention in practice to the unique variabilities of each client. Eric Topol MD - author of The Patient Will See You Now - identifies the contemporary locus of power shift from the so-called 'experts' to the individual, as the \"Gutenberg Moment for Medicine\". At one end of the spectrum a client may have a monumental, utterly tangible 'shift' with Assemblage Point Reconnection. On the other hand, the client may seem to 'feel nothing'. In both cases clients are encouraged to journal/paying attention to dreams and insights in the proceeding nights and days, to help with seeing the unseen/knowing the unknown, besides having a distinct baseline from which they began. This kind of client/patient/individual approach that re-empowers and engages them to achieve their own vibrant health will be the medicine of the future, McFarlane added. \"Thus our wits grow ever sharper and we are empowered to chart a bold new course,\" she said. \"Assemblage Point today is coming into focus, as the colour blue once did; heretofore imperceptible, now perceived. We work the edge of consciousness in our practice, in our world, the 'Wellness Zone' our touchstone. Illumination As I sat in my chair, taking in deep breaths, I could feel the slight pressure right at my higher heart area. My eyes were closed, yet I could still see Theragem's light beam target my chest area from 6 feet away. The \"stuckness\" I had felt since a devastating Ayahuasca experience I had two years ago in an instance was lifted. I was plucked from the void, where my AP had been slightly dislodged for some time now. All the healing work I had done in the past to clear that (unfamiliar) feeling, was lifted in a moment and the void was lit up like a bright white firecracker illuminating freeness and infinite possibilities. I felt light and free. My Assemblage Point Reconnections have been life changing. One realization I had was that I can choose to be gentle on myself or hard on myself. Although I greatly revere and appreciate the plant medicines, teachers in their own right, I chose not to burden my body with any more sleepless nights filled with purging a bitter brew. Nor did I want to experience a drastic shift in my Assemblage Point. Whether people realize it or not, when it comes to any healing work, medicine work, spiritual ecstasy, our Assemblage Point is affected by the frequency and intention held by all those involved. Whatever we experience and wherever it takes us, it's important to remember that there is a natural balanced placement of our Assemblage Point, where we function optimally on all levels. In less than a half an hour, I can receive that elusive core healing with the Assemblage Point Reconnection I knew was always there. \"If anything can change the world it would be the Assemblage Point Reconnection,\" Green said. \"Having our Assemblage Point constantly in balance, would change the world entirely because we wouldn't look at anything the same.\" Additional Note The correct position of the Assemblage Point is located in the same area as the heart chakra and RM17 (ShanZhong on the Conception Vessel); however it is not the same. Moving the AP even slightly out of position has shown that visual skin discoloration, itching and swelling can take place that with correcting the AP disappears overnight. \u00a9 Copyright Medica Health International 2015 Comments: - Prof. Keith Scott-Mumby. MD, MB, HMD, FCRP. said.. In new book entitled 'Medicine Beyond' I this to say about Castaneda: ISBN 978-09884196-8-1 http://www.alternative-doctor.com/medicinebeyond/ \"I must caution the reader that the description of this process {shifting the Assemblage Point} given by Carlos Castaneda in his book 'The Fire From Within' is not only unhelpful but definitely misleading. I have reason to believe that what he describes is a variant of the techniques used by shaman 'Tom Two Bears Wilson' on whom he may have modelled Don Juan, the sorcerer. This was an atypical version because Castaneda himself was in bad shape. In any case there continues real doubt about what Castaneda' sources were; he was certainly good at hiding them. Indeed there are many who consider his whole evocation of Shamanism a fraud. The years before his death hardly add to his image; in the words of Mick Brown, 'Rather than dying the immaculate death of the sorcerer, it's suggested that the sorcerer's apprentice died a frail, paranoid and angry old man lashing out at the world with lawsuits'. Over the years 1996 and 1997 Jon Whale published two more comprehensive articles in Positive Health, detailing the medical symptomatology and dangers of unhealthy Assemblage Point locations in a 3 -part series and the methods for correction, The following year Jon received a litigatious restraining fax from Carlos Castaneda's offices. It stated that only Castaneda had the rights to the medical applications of the Assemblage Point. The irony is that Carlos Castaneda failed to provide any of his readers with any methods or details of how to correct an unhealthy or detrimental located Assemblage Point and besides the work had already been done. In fact Castaneda had no such rights. He was far from the discoverer\" Jon Whale first published in a three part series of articles, precise details how to locate and correct the human Assemblage Point. These articles were published in the UK's health journal: Positive Health In 1996 and 1997.

Core Energy: Shifting the Assemblage Point by Jon Whale PhD listed in energy medicine, originally published in issue 17 - January 1997: http://www.positivehealth.com/article/energy-medicine/core-energy-shifting-the-assemblage-point Whale also published an extended version of the above abridged articles in a monograph document in 1997 entitled 'THE SHAMAN'S BLOW. This monograph was reproduced and circulated by MILLENIA PRESS, Victoria, B.C. Canada in 1997. Following the publication in 1996-7 of Jon Whale's three part series of articles in the Positive Health journals about the medical symptomology relating to unhealthy Assemblage Pointlocations and the methods for correction, the following year Jon also received a litigatious restraining Fax from Carlos Castaneda's offices. It stated that only Castaneda had the rights to the medical applications of the Assemblage Point. The irony is that Carlos Castaneda failed to provide his readers with any methods or details on how to correct an unhealthy or detrimentally located Assemblage Point and besides the work denied had already been done. A decade previously in the September 1988 Jon Whale arranged a meeting with the North American Indian Shaman called Harley SwiftDeer Reagan. SwiftDeer employed large specimens of machined and polished quartz crystals within his Shamanic work and teachings. Jon Whale exhibited to SwiftDeer one of his early prototype electronic gem therapy instruments. SwiftDeer said that he was all in favour of combining electronics with crystals and gem stones for the purpose of increasing their healing power. SwiftDeer talked about the Assemblage Point. He used a large rose quarts crystal to shift the Assemblage Point to the center of the chest. This was a ritualistic practice used at important events such as before entering a native Indian 'Sweat Lodge' ceremony. That evening's event was an Assemblage Point shift to the center of the chest, followed by a 'Sweat Lodge' ceremony. This event was for Jon and other people present a profound experience, each person experiencing the privilege of discovering their Assemblage Point as a life giving reality. SwiftDeer was not complimentary about Castenada's books intimating to Jon Whale that it was important to research, record and publish the different Assemblage Point locations relating to medical health problems. SwiftDeer used a method to shift the Assemblage Point described by Jon Whale as: 'The Sliding Shift'. Jon Whale taught it directly personally to me, along with the other methods he had developed. It is neither a version of chakras nor meridians but the similarities are startling. Again we are talking of a universal life energy flowing in and around the body. But in this shamanic model there is a definite vortex coming in at the chest, called the core Assemblage Point.\" Harley Swiftdeer Reagan.
