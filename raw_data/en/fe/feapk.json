Ayurveda is based on the principle that to achieve and maintain health over the course of your life, you must re-balancing emotions, improve diet, practice yoga and \"pranayama\" (breathing exercises), and make lifestyle adjustments. How Ayurveda Works Every human is characterized by the mind-body type. In [Ayurveda](https://www.yo1.com/curative-therapies/ayurveda.html), these primary qualities that govern the body are called \"doshas.\" Like traditional Chinese medicine, the five elements of nature - water, earth, fire, space, and air make up for a combination in the three primary doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha. When these doshas are perfectly balanced, the state of being is healthy. When they fall out of balance through dehydration, anxiety, stress, low energy or excessive exertion,the person is propelled into a state of \"vikruti\" - an imbalanced state of body and mind. Ayurveda brings health and keeping the doshas in balance. Overall, it aims at holistically maintaining and improving general health no matter what age you are. Let's take a look. Benefits of Ayurveda Ayurveda offers extensive therapies and remedies for the young, old, sick, healthy, and everyone in between. This 5,000 year old medicine system that originated in India has many life-altering benefits. Here are some of the primary benefits that one can achieve with consistent use of Ayurveda. 1. Weight Loss and Maintenance A healthy diet and modification in lifestyle habits through Ayurvedic treatments help shed excess body fat. In Ayurveda, weight is not a major concern but eating habits are. By allowing the body to detox through correct dietary restrictions, it is possible to achieve a toned body. Consult a practitioner to determine the best diet that will suit your nutritional needs and work with your dosha type. 2. Healthy and Glowing Skin and Hair Need a perfect glow and shiny hair? Ayurveda claims that you can ditch the expensive clinical treatments and go for the organic and natural ways to achieve a glow without spending too much money. A balanced meal, toning exercises, and Ayurvedic supplements are enough to promote a healthy skin and scalp. General dietary guidelines in Ayurveda focus on consumption of fresh food taking into account your dosha type, medical history, regional produce, customs, and traditions. The focus is more on high-antioxidant foods, herbs, teas, vegetables, protein, and healthy fats. 3. Say Goodbye to Stress With a fast-paced lifestyle that leaves no scope for rejuvenation or relaxation, Ayurveda guarantees reduction in stress and anxiety. Regular practice of yoga, meditation, breathing exercises, massages, and herbal treatments allow the body to calm down, detoxify, and rejuvenate. [Yoga](https://www.yo1.com/curative-therapies/yoga.html) improves the autonomic nervous system making your mind alert, so you can focus well and stay energized throughout the day. Breathing exercises keep infections at bay and allow abundant oxygen supply to the cells to create a sense of awareness. Depression and anxiety can be treated with Shirodhara, Abhyangam, Shiroabhyangam, and Padabhyangam. 4. Reduce Inflammation Lack of proper diet, unhealthy eating routines, insufficient sleep, irregular sleep patterns, and bad digestion can lead to inflammation. The root cause of neurological diseases, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular problems, pulmonary diseases, arthritis, and many others starts with inflammation. As you begin to eat according to your dosha type, the digestive system begins to strengthen. Consumption of certain foods at the right times reduces toxins in the blood and digestive tract. A consequent result of this is increased vitality, high energy, and an overall decrease in lethargy and mood swings. Ayurvedic treatments are greatly known for cancer prevention as well. The best example of an herbal Ayurvedic formulation would be a combination of turmeric with black pepper. 5. Cleanse the Body Panchakarma in Ayurveda is the practice of eliminating bodily toxins through enemas, oil massages, blood letting, purgation, and other oral administration. By administering these components in the human body, this allows to the elimination of food and toxins that interfere with efficient bodily functions. A cleansed body in turn aids for improved overall health. Suitable home remedies that are vastly used in Ayurvedic herbal medicines are cumin, cardamom, fennel, and ginger which cure indigestion in the body and prevent bloating. 6. Lower Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, and Symptoms of Illness and Diseases Researchers suggest that Ayurvedic diets and relaxation techniques help reduce plaque buildup. Plaque is a result of the formation of cholesterol and fats in the inner lining of the arteries. This condition is called atherosclerosis and is the root cause of heart attacks and strokes. Ayurvedic medicine offers a multitude of herbs, vitamins, minerals, and proteins. These are mixed together at an appropriate dosage and administered at an optimal time to prevent and combat immunity related disorders. Ayurvedic herbs and essential oils help increase blood flow, compliment blood circulation, and draws out toxins from the body through the skin. \"Abhyanga massage\" with herbal oils is highly used for massages.
