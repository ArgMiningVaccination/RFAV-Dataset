In addi- tion, the School is responsible for those cours-es in composition, humanities, fine arts and natural sciences, mandated by the University's core curriculum. The School is committed to an interdisciplin- ary approach that it believes best prepares students for the challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century, and for graduate school. The Biology Program is designed to prepare students for further study in graduate or pro- fessional schools, or for employment in edu-cation, industry, or governmental service. Students may follow a general biology cur - riculum or elect an option in pre-chiropractic, pre-medicine, pre-dentistry, pre-naturopathy, pre-veterinary, marine biology, or zoology. The General Studies Program gives adult learners, as well as traditional undergraduates, greater flexibility in completing their studies by offering broad areas of disciplinary con-centration in place of more traditional majors. Students use this option to pursue careers in business and social science and as a pre-pro-fessional degree. The First Year Studies Program develops, pro- motes, and administers programs and services for under prepared freshmen, who are given the opportunity to demonstrate their true abil- ity. Students remain in the program for one to four semesters depending on their level of achievement. They use the record they have compiled to transfer into their major of choice at the University. The Health Sciences Program prepares stu- dents for entry level positions in exercise and fitness, and in nutrition, as well as for advanced study in pharmacy, physician assis- tant, nursing, and other professional programs in the health sciences. The curriculum in this program includes basic foundation courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics as well as in required courses in philosophy and psychology. The Human Services Program combines theoretical coursework with fireld work ex-perience to prepare students for careers in human service agencies and community or - ganizations. The program requires students to 43supplement their course work in the human services and gerontology with courses in psy- chology, sociology, and related fields. The Literature and Civilization Program gives students a general foundation in the liberal arts while, at the same time, examining the connections within and between them. With- in this major, students may opt for a concen-tration in Creative Writing, English, History, Philosophy. The Mathematics Program is designed to pre- pare the student for graduate work in math-ematics and allied areas, industrial employ- ment, secondary school teaching, and careers in quantitative areas of biological and social sciences. The Medical Laboratory Science program pre- pares students for careers in a hospital labora- tory with opportunities for growth in research or molecular diagnostics. The MLS Program may also serve as a pre-med or pre-physician assistant training program. In addition to the specific medical laboratory science, biology, and chemistry courses required for the pro- gram, students will demonstrate competency in foundation courses in biology, chemistry, and mathematics as well as in required cours- es in philosophy and psychology. The Music Program offers three distinct four-year programs leading to the Bachelor of Music degree: Music Education, Perfor - mance, and Music Business. Music students are required to complete music foundation courses and one of the three concentrations. The Music Business concentration reflects the growing complexity of the commercial music scene. The Psychology Program gives students a knowledge of the general areas of develop- mental, personality, social, cognitive, and ab-normal psychology, preparing them for em- ployment in psychology and related fields or for further study in graduate programs. The program permits ancillary study in related subject areas in the human services, the hu- manities, the social sciences, and biology. The School provides courses in Physics and Chemistry in support of the University's Sci- ence and Engineering programs. Facilities The music programs are housed in the Arnold Bernhard Center which provides classroom, performance, and lecture hall space. Individ- ual students have access to spacious practice and recording areasThe Biology and Mathematics program are lo-cated in Dana Hall. Three floors are occupied by Biology, Physics, Chemistry, and Geology laboratories. Internships, Co-operative Programs and Professional Opportunities The School offers students a variety of options dependent on their major interests.

TIME LIMITATION AND PROGRAM CONTINUITY All requirements for the degree of Master of Science must be completed within six years (twelve consecutive semesters) of the effec-tive start of an approved graduate program of study. Once a program is initiated, the student must maintain continuous enrollment until completion. Under certain circumstances, a student may be granted permission to interrupt his/ her program by petitioning the Dean in writing, stating the underlying circumstances. Pro- gram interruption without formal permission will constitute grounds for dismissal from the Graduate School.School of Engineering52DEGREE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS All graduate students must have on file an ap- proved program of study on the form provid- ed. Programs of study are worked out between the student and his/her advisor to meet both the student's desires and the graduate faculty's philosophy of an integrated program. The pro- gram of study must carry the approval of the chair of the department awarding the degree. Changes in the approved program of study must be approved by the student's program advisor and the department Chair. ENGINEERING COLLOQUIUM REQUIREMENT All Engineering students are required to regis- ter for the Engineering Colloquia Series (ENGR 400) once during their course of study. Stu- dents are expected to register in their first se-mester. Students who do not pass the course are required to repeat the course in a subse- quent semester. GENERAL THESIS REGULATIONS MS Students are encouraged to include a the- sis investigation in their approved program of study. Accumulation of thesis semester hours and work done during a thesis investigation must be continuous up to the time of its com-pletion. Only those students designated as regular graduate students who have satisfied the following requirements will be permit-ted to accumulate thesis credits. During the semester prior to that in which the student desires to initiate his/her thesis investigation, he/she must have: 1. Included a thesis investigation in his/her approved program of study; 2. Sought and obtained a member of the graduate faculty who agrees to act as his/ her thesis advisor; 3. Submitted a completed thesis investigation form to the department in which the de-gree is to be awarded; 4. Obtained a Thesis Committee, appointed by the department chair, consisting of three members of the graduate faculty (in-cluding the advisor as committee chair). Students should obtain a copy of \"Specifica-tions for Master's Thesis\" from the office of the department chair which describes require- ments in detail. All theses in Engineering must be presented at a faculty-graduate seminar. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that this requirement is fulfilled, and that written notice of the presen-tation is distributed to all interested persons at least one week before the event. Students who are in the process of complet-ing a thesis are required to register for at least two semester hours of thesis in each semester, including summer, that they actively engage in that activity under faculty guidance. Semester hours thus accumulated that total more than the approved program of-study requirement are not counted toward the degree. This procedure does not apply to Electrical En- gineering, where students have up to 3 semes- ters (not counting the summer semester) to start and finish their project/thesis. For every semes-ter they are not registered for any credits, they must take ELEG 596 (seminar) for 1 credit. They do not take ELEG 596 in the summer semester, unless it is their last semester. Upon successful completion of the thesis, and acceptance by the Thesis Committee, provided all other requirements in the program of study are completed, the student becomes eligible for the degree. COMPLETION OF MASTER'S DEGREE The Master of Science degree will be awarded only to those students successfully complet-ing the following requirements: 1. A minimum of 31 semester hours (34 hours for Technology Management) with a QPR of \"B\" or better in an approved program of study. The number of semester hours which may be transferred from another in-stitution is an individual matter that will be reviewed by the major department, but is normally no more than 6 semester hours. 2. Satisfactory completion of the state licen-sure requirements as prescribed by the faculty of the major department, and a fa-vorable recommendation from the faculty upon review of the student's program and performance, after the student has made formal application for a Master's diploma. When the degree is completed with a thesis, a minimum of eight courses of three semester hours each are required for the Master of Sci-ence degree in Electrical Engineering or Me- chanical Engineering. For the Master of Science in Computer Science or Computer Engineer - ing, nine courses of three semester hours each plus six semester hours (minimum) of thesis are required. For the Master of Science degree in Technology Management, nine courses of three semester hours each plus six semester hours (minimum) of thesis are required; for students holding the Bachelor of Science in Manufacturing Engineering or Industrial En-gineering from an approved program, this re-quirement may be reduced to eight courses of three semester hours each, plus six semester hours (minimum) of thesis.COOPERATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAM The School of Engineering offers an optional cooperative education program.

Graphic Design (B.F.A.) Concentration in New Media Industrial Design (B.A.)Interior Design (B.A.) Mission Statement In keeping with a 60-year history of excel- lence, the mission of the Shintaro Akatsu School of Design (SASD) is to offer profes- sional education in the design fields lead-ing to baccalaureate degrees and successful careers in design. SASD develops students' abilities to identify, analyze, and solve de-sign problems using culturally sensitive and environmentally sustainable methodologies and technologies. SASD is committed to ad- vancing the use of best-practices in all areas of design. Professional Environment Each student has a space for in-class assign-ments with an adjacent computer design stu- dio, a clean room for large-scale mock-ups and a well-equipped model shop and a pho-tography studio. In addition to the full time faculty, practicing professional designers are invited to teach studio courses ensuring that the student receives a practical and current education. Portfolio Focus An important semester event is the Open House; professional designers are invited to a portfolio review in a celebration of the stu- dent's semester work. An aggressive summer internship program for the sophomore and junior students is key to their professional success. The senior thesis reinforces this in- ternship experience. With the combination of a professional, robust portfolio and exten-sive internship experience our graduates are well prepared for an exciting and fulfilling career.Computer Emphasis We have a strong Computer Aided Design (CAD) emphasis balanced by traditional skill development. We use powerful programs that include Vellum 3D, formZ, Photoshop, Illustrator, IronCAD, Alias Studio, Maya, Final Cut Pro, Premiere, Flash, and Solidworks. An example of our cutting-edge use of technol-ogy is in the Junior design studio, where students use the computer to directly create prototypes using stereolithography through a local high technology company. Local Innovation Connecticut has a spectacular history of in-novation, invention, engineering, illustra- tion, and design. Connecticut has the high- est patents per capita. Many well-established corporations and a rapidly growing array of new high technology companies are in the immediate area. Bridgeport Machines, Dicta-phone, Pitney Bowes, Remington, and Sikor - sky Aircraft Corporation are next door and the World Headquarters of General Electric is in the nearby town of Fairfield. Evo, Prod- uct Ventures, Group Four Design, and 9th Wave are just a sample of the consulting ani-mation, advertising, and interior design firms a short distance from Bridgeport.

It serves a quarter of the world's population and has increased in public acceptance in the United States and Europe as the fastest grow- ing complementary health care field. TCM has gained this respect by being the most ancient written form of medical therapy known. For more information, call Dr. Jennifer Brett: (203) 576-4122 or 1-800-EXCEL-UB (1-800-392- 3582), ext. 4122 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which encompasses acupuncture, manual therapy, diet counseling, herbal therapies, exercise and breathing techniques, has been in use for thousands of years. Over the millennia, the Asian community has continuously refined this ancient healing art. During the last cen-tury, this refinement has included integration of Western medical sciences within the para- digm of TCM.MS-AC The development of the Master of Science in Acupuncture degree program integrates the medical concepts of both the East and West. The student will learn classical acupuncture and Traditional Chinese medical theory as well as up-to-date western bio-medical sci- ences. The Master of Science in Acupuncture degree program's goal is to provide acupuncture and Traditional Chinese medical training consis- tent with the developing traditions in Asia and the growing modern health care system in the United States. Having an opportunity to work alone and in conjunction with other health care practitio-ners in the Health Sciences Center, the stu- dents will be able to integrate the care of pa- tients with other health care providers. Thus, the student gains a \"real world\" advantage before entering private practice. MS-TCM The MS-TCM is a 4-year program during which the students are instructed in Chinese Herbol- ogy during three (3) of the four (4) years of training, after a first year of basic sciences, theory and diagnosis classes lay the founda- tion for understanding the art and science of a full range of TCM modalities. All foundational courses and clinical rotations from the MS-AC program are included in the MS-TCM. The nearly 3400-hours of training in Tradi- tional Chinese Medicine modalities, including excellent training in acupuncture, moxibus- tion, tui na as well as Chinese herbal studies is designed to produce graduates with exem-plary clinical skills. The clinical focus of this program is evident from the very first classes and permeates all the training in the MS-TCM program. The MS-TCM program is a residential pro- gram with students completing over 80% of their course work and 100% of their clinical rotations in residence. The ASIAN/CHINESE HERBOLOGY (ACH) courses will be offered in a blended format with 50% of the didac- tic program offered online and 50% during 4 weekends each semester, and an additional 3 weekends each summer for a total of 11 weekends a year. Students will participate in an online environment to complete their ASIAN/CHINESE HERBOLOGY studies. MS-CH The MS-CH program is a stand-alone program that will allow licensed health care profes-sionals to better understand Chinese Herbol- ogy and be able to safely utilize these herbal products. Currently, many healthcare professionals are able to prescribe herbal therapies (MDs, DOs, NDs, DCs, L.Acs) or work with herbal thera- pies (PharmDs). The MS-CH program is the only clinically-oriented systematic mas- ters-level program for health professionals in these therapies. The focus of this program is on not only clinical usage of Chinese herbal therapies but also on safety in the clinical set- ting while framing the clinical use of these herbs in the TCM tradition. The potential for issues associated with integrated care and drug-herb and nutrient-herb interactions are covered in detail within the MS-CH courses. The nearly 900-hours of training in Chinese herbal studies will produce graduates with exemplary clinical skills. The clinical focus of this program is evident from the very first classes and permeates all the training in the MS-CH program. D.TCM. The D.TCM is a 170-credit, 4-year program during which the students are instructed in both biomedicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The first year of studies fo-cuses on biomedicine and TCM theory and diagnosis classes which form the foundation for understanding the art and science of TCM modalities. The second and third years in- troduce students to the full panoply of TCM treatment modalities including acupuncture, Chinese herbology, dietetics, tui na, taijichuan and qigong. The last two years of training fo- cus on clinical rotations both on campus and off campus including training in integrated medical settings. The D-TCM program is designed to provide significant training in biomedicine and inte- grative medicine for those interested in pro- viding traditional Chinese medicine in primary care. Chinese medicine practitioners (L.Ac.s) play an important part in U.S. healthcare. The Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination against complementary and alternative medi- cine (CAM) practitioners, including acupunc- turists. UBAI is dedicated to ensuring that its graduate practitioners are included in all as- pects of healthcare, from the private office to hospitals and public health forums. UBAI's D-TCM program will help gradu- ates participate in a healthcare system that is multidisciplinary and enhances competence, 59mutual respect, and collaboration across all healthcare disciplines. The clinical program stresses a team-based approach to care. Degree Master of Science in Acupuncture (M.S.Ac.)

Western Biomedicine AMR: Movement, Respiration and Bodywork Studies ACS: Clinical Services ACH: Chinese Herbal Therapies ACC: Chinese Herbal Clinic AIC: Integrated Clinical Practice The course numbering for the system is as fol- lows: 500 level - courses offered in year one 600 level - courses offered in year two700 level - courses offered in year three or four800 level - courses offered in the fourth year of the doctoral program The second digit identifies the semester the course is given in that academic year. The third digit indicates the area. E.g.: APT 524 APT: Acupuncture Practice and Techniques 5 - year one2 - second semester 4 - fourth course in the area sequence Grades Grades earned by students are submitted to the Registrar utilizing the following designa- tions. Grades earned are on a four (4) point scale with a grade of \"A\" or 4 quality points being the highest grade attained. Grades with quality points are: GRADE QUALITY POINTS A 4.0 B+ 3.5 B 3.0 C+ 2.5C 2.0 D 1.0 F 0.0The cumulative quality point ratio (QPR) is determined by dividing the number of semes-ter hours into the number of points earned. Transfer credits are not included in this com- putation. Administrative Grades In addition to the academic grades submit-ted by faculty, the following Administrative Grades are also utilized. I: The grade of Incomplete \"I\" is used by the faculty to indicate that a student has not completed all course require- ments. A student will have one week from the first day of the next term to meet with the faculty and complete all course requirements unless other arrangements are made with either the faculty member or the program Director prior to the end of the term in which the course was taken. Upon completion of the course requirements the faculty will submit the earned grade. Failure by the student to meet with the faculty and complete the re- quirements in one week from the first day of the next term will result in a grade of \"I\" being converted to a grade of \"F\". Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will be required to register for and re- take that course in its entirety when the course is regularly scheduled. Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will not be able to register for courses for which that course is a prerequisite. R: Students may repeat a course at any grade level below an \"A\". The first re-peat will replace the first-time grade for the computation of the QPR. TCR: This indicates transfer credit granted for equivalent work completed at an-other accredited institution. W: Withdrawal grades are assigned on the following policy statements: 1. If the student officially withdraws from a course during the official change-of-registration period, that course does not appear on the stu- dent's transcript. 2. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the end of the change-of-registration period, but before the end of the official with- drawal period, a grade of \"W\" is as-Acupuncture Institute68signed and that course remains on the student's transcript. Courses with a grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR and do not count towards \"hours attempted.\" 3. The names of students who have officially withdrawn from a course and receive the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the bal-ance of the semester. 4. Any exceptions to the above, in- cluding late withdrawals, must be approved by the Director and the Provost before they become official and are recorded. Poor academic performance does not constitute a valid reason for late withdrawal. Academic Policies ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS Each student is expected to attend all lectures, laboratories and other activities associated with the total completion of a given course. A student who is absent from class in excess of ten percent of the total class hours may have his or her grade reduced for lack of partici- pation as outlined in the course syllabus. A student absent in excess of twenty percent of the total class hours will receive a grade of \"F.\" Requirements for Graduation - MS- AC In order to be eligible for graduation from the Acupuncture Institute program, candidates must meet the following criteria: 1.

No student will graduate from the pro- gram who has not resolved all financial obligations with the University of Bridge- port GOOD ACADEMIC STANDING Good academic standing is achieved when a student is maintaining good grades, has met all financial responsibilities to the Acupuncture Institute degree program, and is not guilty of any breach of standards governing ethical and clinical conduct. ACADEMIC PROBATION Academic probation occurs when the student's cumulative grade point average falls below the required grade point average of 2.9 or if a stu- dent receives one grade of \"F\" or two or more grades of \"D\" during a single semester. A stu- dent who is on academic probation is not in good academic standing and is not eligible to Acupuncture Institute69carry a full academic course load. ACADEMIC REMEDIATION A student who is on Academic Probation will be placed in a program of Academic Reme- diation and will be required to meet with the Director of the Institute. Academic Reme-diation requires a student to carry a reduced academic load. Students will be permitted to convert grades of \"D\" or \"F\" only by retaking the course the next time it is offered by the Acupuncture Institute. Successful completion of a program of aca- demic remediation requires a student to pass each repeated course with a \"C\" or better and have earned a cumulative GPA (CGPA) of 2.9 or better. A student who has not earned a CGPA of 2.9 or better upon one semester of remediation but has shown substantial improvement in his or her course work will be allowed one more semester of remediation in order to achieve the CGPA of 2.9. A student in a program of academic remediation may ask the Director for a written definition of a minimum CGPA, or range of CGPA, which would be deemed to be substantial improvement, and for a written calculation of the semester of remediation GPA which would be necessary to achieve in order to bring the student's CGPA into the range of substantial improvement. In such event the student shall countersign the written statement and deliver a copy of the signed document to the Director. A student may not graduate with a grade of \"D\" on their transcript. Grades of \"D\" may not remain on the student's transcript for more than one year and must be remediated by re- peating the course and receiving a grade of \"C\" or better. This is not a limitation for the instructor, but rather a requirement to pass each course so that students have the appro-priate level of proficiency to pass the NCCTCM Board Exams and become licensed acupunc- turists. A student may remediate a grade only by retaking the course before graduation. If the student does not pass the course with a \"C\" or better, the student will be on Academic Probation and will be required to speak with the Director of the Acupuncture Institute be- fore registering for any new classes. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL A student who after one semester of remedia-tion does not show substantial improvement in his or her academic performance or after two semesters of academic remediation does not achieve a CGPA of 2.9 will be academically dismissed from the acupuncture program. Academic dismissal may also occur if a stu- dent's CGPA falls below 2.9, or if the student receives one \"F' or two grades of \"D\" in one semester on a second occasion. Upon com- pletion of the first semester, any student not achieving at least a 2.9 GPA will be academi- cally dismissed from the program. DISMISSAL FROM THE ACUPUNCTURE INSTITUTE Academic inadequacies are not the only rea- son for dismissal from the Master of Science in Acupuncture degree program. The following is a list of additional causes for dismissal: 1. Failure to meet generally accepted stan-dards of ethical and professional con- duct and clinical practice. Such dismissal is subject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration as es- tablished by the Director of the UBAI. 2. Pleading \"Guilty\" or \"No Contest\", or be- ing found guilty of any crime involving moral turpitude; in the event of a pre- existing or new felony the Institute shall have the right to impose sanctions, in- cluding but not limited to dismissal, on a case by case basis. 3. Repeated violation of public policy, or demonstration of behavior that creates safety hazards and/or disrupts the order of the institution. Dismissal of this nature is subject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration as es-tablished by the Director of the Institute. 4. Failure to meet financial obligations or commitments to the University of Bridge-port Acupuncture Institute. The Institute shall have the right to suspend any student from any or all privileges of a stu- dent in good standing during the pendency of any proceeding pursuant to the foregoing until such time as all University procedures are terminated. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PROGRAM: If a student withdraws or wishes to take a leave of absence from the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute and is in good standing he or she is eligible for readmission. A student who withdraws when not in good academic standing or, who leaves without officially withdrawing seriously jeopardizes his or her chances of future readmission or admission to other acupuncture Institutes. If a student withdraws or takes a leave of ab- sence with plans to reenter at a later date, he or she should make this clear at the time of withdrawal. Please note: All requirements for the mas- ter's degree in Acupuncture (MS-AC) must be completed within five (5) years from the first matriculation to graduation. All requirements for the master's degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine (MS-TCM) must be completed within seven (7) calendar years from the first matricu- lation to graduation. All requirements for the doctoral degree in Traditional Chinese Medi-cine (D.TCM) must be completed within eight (8) calendar years from the first matriculation to graduation. If a student withdraws one or more times from the program, the cumulative absences must not exceed two years. Former University of Bridgeport Naturopathic and Chiropractic students who started acu- puncture training as a combined-degree stu- dent during their professional training who then took a leave of absence or withdrew from the acupuncture institute must demon- strate competency through examination for all work completed prior to withdrawal from the program, with the exception of the basic sci- ence (\"AWB\"-designated) courses, upon read-mission to the program. All such previously completed coursework will then be treated as transfer credit and the time frame for comple-tion of the MS-Acup degree will be 4 years (48 months) from the date of re-entry into the UBAI program; and the time frame for com-pletion of the MS-TCM degree will be 5 years (60 months) from the date of re-entry into the UBAI program. If a student wishes to withdraw or take a leave of absence from the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute, he or she must submit a letter to the Director stating the reason for withdrawal. The student must also complete all required paperwork from the Registrar's of-fice. In addition, the student should also note if he/she plans to re-enter the program and the term (Fall/Spring year) of such re-matric- ulation. READMISSION TO THE PROGRAM To be considered for readmission to the pro-gram after withdrawal or leave of absence, write to the Assistant Director of the Institute requesting readmission and indicate the date of re-entry desired. It is important to do this Acupuncture Institute70well in advance of the proposed date of read- mission.

Applications will be accepted each year until the class has been filled.Acupuncture Institute71Notification of Acceptance Applicants will be notified in writing of the de- cision of the Admissions Committee as soon as a decision is made. Transfer Credit Policy Students may apply to have some of the train- ing required by the Acupuncture Institute for graduation transferred from another acupunc- ture degree-granting program, or an accred-ited school of post-graduate medical training. Transfer credit will be assessed by the Insti- tute Director and is only awarded for courses similar in content and length, and with instruc-tors similarly qualified as those given by the Acupuncture Institute. Students requesting transfer credit must provide an official course transcript, a school catalog and, if requested, a course syllabus for any course for which trans- fer credit is requested. Documentation of the transfer of credit awarded, and the institution from which transfer credit was awarded are kept in the student files. No less than 20 clini-cal credits and 14 didactic class credits must be completed at the Acupuncture Institute for the student to be eligible for graduation and the granting of the MS-Acupuncture and MS-Tradi- tional Chinese Medicine degrees. All students, including transfer students, must complete the Clinical Entrance Exam with a score of no less than 75%, the Clinical Exit Exam and all practi- cal clinical examinations with a grade of 70% or better to be eligible for graduation. An applicant's credits from another Institute may be considered for transfer only under the following conditions: 1. The applicant must meet current pre-requisites in force at the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute at the time the student originally enrolled at the health profession institution from which the transfer is being made, regardless of having been accepted to the institu-tion from which they are transferring. In many cases, University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute's requirements are higher than those for other acupuncture related professional schools. 2. Be courses for a student majoring in the medical sciences, acupuncture or TCM medicine 3. The institution from which the student is transferring must be acceptable to the Admissions Committee of the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute, such as another acupuncture degree-granting program, or an accredited school of post-graduate medical training. 4. The credits being transferred must be equivalent in credit hours content and quality to that of the University of Bridge- port Acupuncture Institute. If the Univer - sity of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute course contains a laboratory so must the course being considered for transfer. In order to verify equivalence, students may be required to provide a course descrip- tion or course syllabus for comparison. 5. Only credits with a grade of \"C\" (2.00 on a 4.00 scale) or better are considered for transfer. Transfer credit is credit only; the transferred grade will not affect the QPR. 6. In order to obtain transfer credit the stu-dent must have graduated or have been granted an honorable withdrawal from the professional or graduate school at- tended. 7. To receive transfer credit for any courses taken 3 or more years prior to entering the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute, and for any course completed during an apprenticeship or other non- traditional or non-accredited learning en- vironment, the student must demonstrate competency through examination. The passing grade for such exams is 75%. 8. Credits used to satisfy the minimum pre- requisites for admission must not be used for advanced placement credit. 9. All international transcripts and course descriptions must be evaluated by an ap-proved foreign credential evaluation ser - vice. Transfer Credit - D.TCM The D-TCM degree program will not be ac-cepting direct transfer credit. Because a first doctoral level degree is new to the field of acupuncture in the US, all students seeking advanced standing will have to have knowl- edge of specific subjects assessed through a combination of challenge exams and portfolio review. Each challenge exam carries an exam fee of $85. Portfolio reviews require an accepted student to take a course in portfolio construc-tion and then pay $85 for each course that is being challenged through the portfolio review. No more than 90 credits may be transferred into the D-TCM program from outside institu- tions.Advanced Standing Students who are accepted as transfer students may receive advanced standing if a substantial number of semester hours have been accepted by University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Insti-tute. This may enable the student to complete either the MS-ACUP program in less than six semesters, or the MS-TCM degree in less than eight semesters. Transfer credit may be grant- ed either with or without advanced standing. If advanced standing is granted: No more than 84 credits may transfer from an- other institution of acupuncture or TCM medi- cine for the MS-ACUP degree. No more than 110 credits may transfer from another institu- tion of acupuncture or TCM medicine for the MS-TCM degree. No more than 90 credits may be transferred into the D-TCM program from outside institutions. No less than 20 clinical credits and 14 didactic class credits must be completed at the Acu- puncture Institute for a student to be eligible for graduation and the granting of the MS-Acu- puncture or MS-Traditional Chinese Medicine degree. No less than 25 clinical credits and 50 didactic class credits must be completed at the Acupuncture Institute for a student to be eligible for graduation and the granting of the Doctorate in Traditional Chinese Medicine degree. All students, including transfer students, must complete the Clinical Entrance Exam with a score of no less than 75%, the Clinical Exit Exam and all practical clinical examinations with a grade of 70% or better to be eligible for graduation. Advanced standing in the Acupuncture Insti- tute requires evaluation of official transcripts and course descriptions from the institution of higher learning where the student received his or her training as described in Transfer Credit above. Foreign students must have their transcripts evaluated by a foreign transcript evaluating services, such as World Educational Services (WES). A special curriculum sched- ule will be made up for the student based on semester hours transferred and course avail- ability. Tuition will be calculated based on the num- ber of credits being taken per semester multi- plied by the single credit fee at the time of the student's attendance. If advanced standing is not granted, but some semester hours are transferable, the student will be admitted to the first semester and will be exempt from courses for which transfer Acupuncture Institute72credit was granted. Former University of Bridgeport students in the other graduate-level health sciences pro- grams who started acupuncture training as a combined-degree student during their profes- sional training who then took a leave-of ab- sence or withdrew from the Acupuncture In-stitute must demonstrate competency through examination for all work completed prior to withdrawal from the program, with the excep-tion of the basic science (\"AWB\"-designated) courses, upon readmission to the program. All such previously completed coursework will then be treated as transfer credit and the time frame for completion of the MS- Acupuncture degree program will be four (4) years (48 months) from the date of re-entry into the UBAI program; and the time frame for completion of the MS-Traditional Chinese Medicine degree program will be five (5) years (60 months) from the date of re-entry into the UBAI program. Evaluation of advanced standing is completed by the Director of the Acupuncture Institute. Upon request, a letter is sent to the student, with a copy available in the student file, of all coursework which is acceptable for trans- fer credit. The transfer credit grades will not appear on official transcripts from the Univer - sity of Bridgeport and the grades from those classes will not affect a student's GPA. Course prerequisites must be completed by all students, including those taking courses as auditors, before admission to a course will be granted. Exceptions may be made by permis- sion of the Director under the following spe- cial circumstances: 1. A student has skills equivalent to comple-tion of the pre-requisites from non-tradi- tional training or experience (i.e.: in an apprenticeship). Students may request a waiver from completing the prerequisites before taking more advanced courses. Students will have to complete all such courses or demonstrate competency through examination before graduation from the Acupuncture Institute. 2. A University of Bridgeport Health Scienc- es graduate student requires special skills for an outreach clinic setting (e.g.: clean needle technique and auricular acupunc- ture for NADA-style detox treatments).Transfer of Credit for Foreign Health Profession Institutions To be eligible for transfer of credits, applicants from foreign acupuncture, medical, chiroprac- tic, osteopathic or dental institutions located in countries that do not have an accredita-tion system equivalent to those of the United States, must submit evidence of proficiency in all work submitted for advance standing cred-it. Credits from foreign Institutes and universi- ties must have transcript evaluation performed by a reputable transcript evaluation service. To receive advanced-standing for courses taken 3 or more years prior to entering the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute, and for any course completed during an ap- prenticeship or other non-traditional or non- accredited learning environment, the student must demonstrate competency through exami- nation. The passing grade for such exams is 75%.Acupuncture Institute73College of Chiropractic Dean: Michael Ciolfi Elenore Dana (203) 576-4483 E-mail: mciolfi@bridgeport.edu Associate Dean: Telephone: (203) 576-4336 Fax: (203) 576-4351 E-mail: psherman@bridgeport.edu Associate Dean, Anthony Sciences Street Telephone: Chiropractic is the philosophy, art, and sci- ence which concerns itself with the relation- ship between structure and function of the human body, as that relationship may affect the restoration and preservation of health. The College of Chiropractic prepares stu-dents to be primary health care providers. Each student is educated to diagnose, to care for the human body, to understand and re-late fundamental scientific information, and to consult with, or refer to other health care providers. The University of Bridgeport College of Chi- ropractic is a non-profit, coeducational pro- fessional institution which grants the Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) degree to graduates who successfully complete four academic years of study including a clinical internship. The program is offered on a full-time basis with no students admitted to a part-time course of study. There are no correspon-dence courses offered. All requirements for the D.C. degree must be completed with-in seven years from the dated of matriculation. Degree Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.)Accreditation & Membership The doctor of chiropractic degree program of the University of Bridgeport College of Chi- ropractic is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of the Council on Chiropractic Education, 8049 N. 85th Way, Scottsdale, AZ 85258, 480-443-8877. The College of Chiro- practic is also a member of the Association of Chiropractic Colleges. Mission Statement Provide a comprehensive, full-time educa-tion that prepares qualified candidates to become doctors of chiropractic. Present a clinically relevant and integrated curriculum that is evidenced-influenced in regard to basic sciences, chiropractic prin-ciples and related health sciences. To adhere to a curriculum that emphasizes: The body is an integrated unit; The body has intrinsic self-regulating and healing mechanisms; Structure and function are interrelated; The neuromusculoskeletal system can effect the functioning of other body sys- tems and, in turn, can be affected by these systems. Produce graduates who will be competent to practice as portal of entry chiropractic physi-cians, providing diagnostic services, health services, humanistic care and conservative methods of therapeutics to assist patients in achieving health and wellness. Advance chiropractic and its knowledge base through scholarship and research. Provide opportunities for faculty, students and staff to engage in activities which ser - vice the needs of the chiropractic profession and the public. Provide for continuous improvement and quality of our programs through assessment, and by fostering an atmosphere of knowl-edge, growth and open discussions. Curriculum A Doctor of Chiropractic is a physician whose purpose is to meet the health needs of the public as a member of the healing arts. He/she gives particular attention to the relationship of structural and neurological aspects of the body and is educated in the basic and clinical sciences as well as in re-lated health subjects. Chiropractic science concerns itself with the relationship between structure (primarily the spine), and function (primarily coordinated by the nervous sys- tem) of the human body as that relationship may affect the restoration and preservation of health.. \"The DCP of the University of Bridgeport incorporates the understanding of chiro-practic as a profession practicing primary health care, provides curricular and clinical evidence of that through outcome measures, and consists of education and training to prepare graduates to: A. Practice direct contact health care as a portal-of-entry provider for patients of all ages and genders; B. Assess the patient's general health sta-tus, complaints and problems leading to a diagnosis. Specific elements of patient assessment minimally include complete health history; review of systems; physi- cal, biomechanical and neurological ex- amination; the analysis of vertebral and extra-vertebral subluxation; and, when clinically indicated, diagnostic imaging, clinical laboratory, and/or specialized di-agnostic procedures; C. Develop a goal-oriented case manage-ment plan that addresses any sublux-ations or other neurobiomechanical prob- lems, and that may include rehabilitation and/or other therapeutic modalities; D. Develop appropriate doctor/patient re- lationships with continuity in the chiro- practic management of health problems, and coordination of care with other health-care providers; and E. Promote wellness by assessing health risk and providing problem-related, general and public health information, and life- style counseling. The purpose of chiropractic professional ed- ucation is to provide the student with a core of knowledge in the basic and clinical sci- ences and related health subjects sufficient to perform the professional obligations of a doctor of chiropractic. A doctor of chiropractic is a primary care physician whose purpose as a practitioner of the healing arts, is to help meet the health needs of individual patients and of the pub- lic, giving particular attention to the struc- tural and neurological aspects of the body. The application of science in chiropractic concerns itself with the relationship between 74structure, primarily the spine, and function, primarily coordinated by the nervous sys- tem of the human body, as that relationship may affect the restoration and preservation of health. Further, this application of science in chi- ropractic focuses on the inherent ability of the body to heal without the use of drugs or surgery. As a gatekeeper for direct access to the health delivery system, the doctor of chiropractic's responsibilities as a primary care physician include wellness promotion, health promo-tion, health assessment, diagnosis and the chiropractic management of the patient's health care needs. When indicated, the doc-tor of chiropractic consults with, co-manag- es, or refers to other health care providers.\" ( From the Council on Chiropractic Education Standards for Doctor of Chiropractic Pro- grams, January 2007) It is the purpose of the University of Bridge- port College of Chiropractic program to offer as a minimum those courses and objectives as suggested in the CCE standards. It is also the purpose of the UBCC program to offer a broad-based educational experience. In many cases, the educational program pre-sented will go beyond the course offerings suggested by CCE and will also go beyond individual state laws and scope of practice. The University of Bridgeport College of Chi- ropractic curriculum is divided into three phases: Basic Sciences, Clinical Sciences, and Clinical Services. Basic Sciences The basic Science curriculum instructs stu-dents in Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Public Health, and Pathology. These courses are offered primarily during the first two years of a student's education. It is the purpose of this aspect of the pro- gram for students to develop an understand-ing of both normal and abnormal structure and function, homeostatic mechanisms, and to gain a foundation upon which the clinical sciences will be built. Clinical Sciences Students from their first semester onward are instructed in the Clinical Sciences. Course offerings include: Chiropractic History, Chi- ropractic Principles and Practice, Diagnosis, Radiology, Technique Procedures, Nutrition, and Physiological Therapeutics and Reha-bilitation Procedures. Students are given in- depth training in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Practical hands-on training is in- cluded beginning in Semester I and continu-ing to graduation. Information from the basic science curriculum is integrated into the clin- ical science course offerings and is a founda-tion upon which the clinical science courses build. Many of the clinical science courses have as a prerequisite successful completion of the basic science courses. Clinical Services The Clinical Services phase of the curricu-lum is the last and most important aspect of the UBCC program. Interns at the Col- lege's Chiropractic Health Center care for patients under the supervision and direction of licensed doctors of chiropractic. To be eligible for this part of the curriculum, stu-dents must be in good academic standing, successfully completed all courses in Semes- ters I thru V, and successfully completed the clinic services entrance examination. During the Clinical Services portion of the program students will continue to receive training in the clinical sciences. They will also continue to be evaluated during their internship in or - der to remain eligible for clinical services. To continue in Clinical Services, students must remain in good academic standing. Towards the completion of the Clinical Services pro-gram students will be administered a clini- cal competency examination which must be successfully completed prior to graduation. Because each course is integrated with other course offerings, students should be aware of the prerequisite and corequisite require-ments. Throughout the curriculum every effort is made to insure the relevance of information to chiropractic principles and practice. The following is a breakdown, by subject, of the time devoted to each area of study within the curriculum. Licensure Requirements and Career Opportunities LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS The Doctor of Chiropractic degree program offered by the University of Bridgeport Col- lege of Chiropractic is accredited by the Council on Chiropractic Education. As in-dicated in a previous section, the college meets or exceeds the minimum educational requirements suggested by the CCE. Students who receive the Doctor of Chiropractic de- gree from UBCC are eligible for licensure in all states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the Canadian Provinces and other foreign coun- tries as regulated by local laws and regula- tions without restrictions. Licensure in many states require students to complete Parts I, II, III, and Physiotherapy examination as of- fered by the National Board of Chiroprac-tic Examiners (NBCE). Additionally, states also require that students pass the Part IV Practical Examination offered by the NBCE. Students should contact the NBCE or the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards (FCLB) for additional information pertaining to licensure where they wish to practice. The College maintains a directory published by FCLB in the library as well as within various offices located in the College of Chiroprac- tic. The directory contains information per - taining to licensure and to scope of practice within each state. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Approximately ninety (90%) percent of the students who have entered the UBCC have completed the requirements for graduation as outlined in this catalog. Most graduates of UBCC go directly into a private practice of their own. Other graduates work as an associate with an experienced doctor or they may rent space within an existing practice.

The third digit indicates the sequence within that discipline. e.g. AN 511 AN - Anatomy 5- year one 1- semester one 1 - first course in discipline sequence Grades earned by students are submitted to the Registrar utilizing the following designa-tions. Grades earned are on a four (4) point scale with an \"A\" or 4 quality points being the highest grade attained. Grades with qual-ity points are: GRADE QUALITY POINTS A 4.0 C 2.0 B+ 3.5 D 0.0 B 3.0 F 0.0 C+ 2.5 The cumulative quality point ratio (QPR) is determined by dividing the number of semester hours into the number of points earned. A grade of \"D\" is not an acceptable passing grade. Transfer credits are not in- cluded in this computation. In addition to the Academic Grades submit- ted by faculty, the following Administrative Grades are also utilized. Administrative Grades I The grade of Incomplete \"I\", is used by the faculty to indicate that a stu- dent has not completed all course re- quirements. A student will have one week from the last day of the term to meet with the faculty and complete all College of Chiropractic77course requirements. Upon comple- tion of the course requirements the faculty will submit the earned grade. Failure by the student to meet with the faculty and complete the requirements in one week from the last day of the term will result in the grade of \"I\" be-ing converted to a grade of \"F.\" Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will be required to register and retake that course in it's entirety when the course is regularly scheduled. Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will not be eligible to register for courses for which that course is a prerequisite. R Students may repeat a course at any grade level below \"A\". The first repeat will replace the first-time grade for the computation of the QPR. TCR This indicates transfer credit granted for equivalent work completed at an- other accredited institution. W Withdrawal grades are assigned based on the following policy statements: 1. If the student officially withdraws from a course during the official change-of- registration period, that course does not appear on the student's transcript. 2. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the end of the change-of-reg- istration period, but before the end of the official withdrawal period, a grade of \"W\" is assigned and that course remains on the student's transcript. Courses with a grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR and do not count toward \"hours attempted.\" 3. The names of students who have official-ly withdrawn from a course and receive the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the balance of the semester. 4. Any exceptions to the above, including late withdrawals, must be approved by the Dean and the Provost before they be- come official and are recorded. Poor aca- demic performance does not constitute a valid reason for late withdrawal. Academic policies used to manage and di- rect the academic program are: 1. Attendance Requirements 2. Requirements for Graduation 3. Good Academic Standing 4. Academic Warning, Probation and Dismissal 5. Dismissal from the College (Non-Academic) 6. Withdrawal from the Program 7. Readmission to the Program Attendance Requirements Each student is expected to attend all lec- tures and laboratories and other activities as- sociated with the total completion of a given course. A student who is absent from class in excess of ten percent of the total class hours may have his or her grade reduced for lack of participation as outlined in the course syl- labus. A student absent in excess of twenty present of the total class hours will receive a grade of \"F.\" Requirements for Graduation In order to be eligible for graduation from the College, candidates must meet the fol- lowing criteria: 1. Have successfully completed a minimum of four academic years of resident study in an accredited institution granting a first professional degree. The last 3 semesters must have been in residence at the Uni- versity of Bridgeport College of Chiro- practic. A student must complete at least 25% of the program to qualify for a UBCC degree and have completed all require- ments within 7 years of matriculations. 2. Have successfully completed all require-ments of the educational program and have achieved a 2.50 cumulative grade point average. 3. Have successfully passed parts I and II of the National Board of Chiropractic Exam- iners. 4. Have been recommended for graduation by the College Faculty and Administration. 5. Have satisfactorily met all financial obli-gations to the College, Office of Financial Aid, publication of the class yearbook and commencement exercises. Satisfactory Academic Progress Students enrolled in the UBCC Doctor of Chiropractic degree program are in good academic standing and are making satisfac- tory academic progress, if they have success-fully achieved the following criteria upon completion of their most recent semester of course work: 1. Did not receive a grade of \"F or D\" in any course, and2. Maintain a cumulative grade point aver - age of 2.50 or better. A student who has not achieved the above criteria is not making satisfactory academic progress and will be required to follow the criteria as outlined in the catalog regarding Academic Probation and Dismissal. Good Academic Standing Good academic standing is achieved when a student is maintaining good grades, has met all financial responsibilities to the College and is not guilty of any breach of the standards governing ethical and clinical conduct. ACADEMIC WARNING, PROBATION AND DISMISSAL Safeguards have been built into the system to protect students who are not performing well academically from suffering academic failure. During the semester, the faculty re-ports to the Dean on a regular basis, con- cerning the grades of all students in their courses. If it is noted that particular students are doing poorly, these students will be con-tacted to set up an interview. The interview will consist of a discussion of the causes for the student's poor performance and ways in which he or she might improve a grade. ACADEMIC WARNING Academic warning will result when the fol-lowing is taking place: 1. The most recent semester quality point ra- tio falls below a 2.00. ACADEMIC PROBATION Academic Probation occurs when the stu- dent's QPR falls below 2.50 or if a student receives a grade of \"F or D\" in one or more courses. A student on academic probation is not eligible to carry a full academic course load. ACADEMIC REMEDIATION A student on academic probation will be placed in a program of Academic Remedia- tion. The student is required to meet with the Associate Dean of the College to deter - mine what courses will be retaken to satisfy the requirements of Remediation. In general, academic Remediation requires a student to repeat all grades of \"F or D\", carry a reduced academic load.College of Chiropractic78ACADEMIC DISMISSAL A student who does not show substantial academic improvement after one semester of Remediation, or who is unable to achieve a QPR of 2.50 after two semester of Reme-diation will be dismissed from the College of Chiropractic. Academic dismissal may also occur if a stu- dent's QPR falls below a 2.50 on a second occasion. Any student not achieving a QPR of at least 1.75 upon completion of the first semester of study will be academically dismissed from the College of Chiropractic. DISMISSAL FROM THE COLLEGE Academic inadequacies are not the only rea-sons for dismissal from the College or Uni- versity. The following is a list of additional causes for dismissal: 1. Failure to meet the generally accepted standards of ethical conduct and clinical practice. Dismissal of this nature is sub- ject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration. 2. Pleading guilty or \"nolo contende,\" or be- ing found guilty of any crime involving moral turpitude or being felonious in na- ture. 3. Repeated violation of public policy, or the demonstration of behavior that creates safety hazards and/or disrupts the order of the institution. Dismissal of this nature is subject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration. 4. Failure to meet financial obligations or commitments to the College or University. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PROGRAM If a student withdraws from University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic in good standing he or she is eligible for readmission. A student who withdraws when not in good academic standing or, who leaves without officially withdrawing, seriously jeopardizes his or her chances of future readmission. If a student withdraws with plans to re-enter at a later date, he or she should make this clear at the time of withdrawal. All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within seven years from the first matriculation to graduation. If a stu-dent withdraws one or more times from the program, the cumulative absences must not exceed three and one half years.READMISSION TO THE PROGRAM To be readmitted to the program after with-drawal, a student must write to the Associ- ate Dean for Academic Affairs requesting readmission and indicate the date of re-entry desired. It is important to do this well in ad- vance of such a date. Minimum Requirements for Admission The University of Bridgeport College of Chi- ropractic does not discriminate on the ba- sis of sex, age, color, creed, ethnic origin or handicap in the administration of its educa-tion programs or on admissions. All candidates for admission must furnish proof of having acquired three years (90 ac-ceptable semester hours or more) of study, creditable towards a baccalaureate degree, taken in accredited, degree-granting institu-tions.

Under ex- tenuating circumstances a telephone inter - view will be granted. Applicants must understand that possession of minimum entrance requirements does not constitute a guarantee of acceptance. Each entering class is selected from a large pool of eligible candidates, a majority of whom have completed four-year degrees. Those students selected for acceptance usually have ob- tained grades which are substantially higher than the minimum requirement. Physical Qualifications for Admissions The following physical qualifications are re- quired for participation in the doctoral degree program at the UB College of Chiropractic. These qualifications are essential for the preparation of the Doctor of Chiropractic. Stu- dents at the College must be able to perform at a high level of competency in all phases of classroom, clinic, and laboratory activities as they will ultimately use the knowledge at-tained as Doctors of Chiropractic. The qualifications are as follows: 1. The student must possess the coordina- tion and use of both upper limbs as their use is required for, among other skills, the performance of the chiropractic ad-justment, the primary skill of a practicing Doctor of Chiropractic. 2. The student must possess manual dexter - ity so that he/she may perform in the var - ious clinical, chiropractic, and basic sci-ence laboratories without posing a threat to him/herself, patients, or his/her fellow students' safety and well-being. 3. The student must have the ability to stand not only in the performance of manipula- tive procedures but others as well. 4. The student must have hearing and visual senses, appropriately assisted if needed, acute enough to individually record pa- tient histories, to provide routine safety in- structions, and perform stethoscopic and other ausucultatory examinations, to read all forms of diagnostic imaging, and to perform microscopy examinations so that College of Chiropractic79he/she can adequately interpret normal, abnormal, and pathological changes. Handicapped persons will not be summarily denied admission, nor will higher scholastic requirements be demanded of them. They, like all other students, must carry out class-room, laboratory, and clinical assignments, including microscopic work, x-ray interpreta- tion and techniques, or the equivalent; pass written, oral, and practical examinations and meet all the requirements of the College. Cancellation of Admission or RegistrationThe college reserves the right to cancel the admission or registration of individuals whose attendance at the college, in the opin- ion of the appropriate administrative officers and dean, is not mutually beneficial to that person and to the institution. Individuals who have registered at other ed- ucational institutions may not disregard such records and make application on the basis of high school and selected college transcripts. Applicants who gain admission to the college on the basis of incomplete or fraudulent cre- dentials or misrepresentations in their written application for admission may have their: admission and registration canceled with- out refund of any fees; and total credits rescinded that have been earned following such admissions;and future registration at the college prohib- ited. Pre-Professional Requirements for Licensure It is most important that all candidates for admission thoroughly investigate the specif- ic requirements of each state in which they plan to practice. In some cases, pre-profes-sional requirements must be completed prior to entrance into a chiropractic program in order to be qualified to apply for a state li-censing examination. International Applicants International Applicants must complete an Application for International Students as well as an Application to the College of Chiro- practic. Applicants who have done pre-professional study in foreign countries must submit of-ficial copies of the records of such study as well as translations if the original records are not in English. Usually, these records must be evaluated by an appropriate professional agency. Any fees charged by such an agency are the responsibility of the student. Follow- ing submission of these documents to UBCC, the Director of Admissions will make contact with the prospective student. If the applicant is a native of a foreign coun- try, he or she must demonstrate proficiency in English at a level appropriate for ad-vanced study. At a minimum proficiency can be demonstrated in one of the ways listed below: 1. A score of 550 or better on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) AND a score of 50 or better on the Test of Spoken English(TSE). Information on the TOEFL/TSE can be obtained from TOEFL, P.O. Box 6151, Princeton, NJ 08541-6151, USA or; 2. Receipt of a grade \"C\" or better in one semester of English at an accredited U.S. college or university or; 3. A letter showing successful completion of the University of Bridgeport's English Language Institute. Application Procedures Application for admission must include: 1. A properly completed Application for Ad- mission form. 2. Application Fee. The applicant must provide the following to the Director of Admissions: 1. Official transcripts of all college records. 2. Three letters of recommendation, one must be from a health care professional. Selection of Candidates The University of Bridgeport College of Chi- ropractic is coeducational and does not dis- criminate against any applicant on the basis of sex, race, creed, color or national origin. (Title VI, Civil Rights Act 1964) All eligible finalists are invited for a personal interview before any action is taken upon their application. Among the qualities typical of most success- ful candidates for admission, the following are especially important: 1. Superior communication skills, both oral and written. 2. Evidence of strong motivation to becom-ing a helping professional and, more spe-cifically, a chiropractor. 3. Initiative and honesty as evidenced in the candidates' transactions within the ap- plication process and in all information submitted in support of the application. 4. Academic achievement which compares favorably with that of successful students at the University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic. Application Deadlines Applications for admission may be submit-ted at any time. NOTIFICATION OF ACCEPTANCE Applicants will be notified in writing of the decision of the Admissions Committee as soon as a decision is made. Transfer Students Transfer Credit The University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic may grant transfer credit for courses taken in accredited professional and graduate schools. In doing so, the following requirements must be met: 1. The courses taken must have content equivalent to courses given at UBCC. lf the UBCC course contains a laboratory, so must the course being considered for transfer. 2. A course being considered for transfer must have credits and hours equivalent to or greater than the same course at UBCC. 3. Any course to be transferred must have been passed with a grade of C or better. (2.0 on a 4.00 scale.) 4. A transferred course carries credit equal to the UBCC course for which credit is granted. The original grade earned is not transferred and does not affect the stu- dent's QPR at UBCC. 5. In order to obtain transfer credit the stu- dent must have been granted an honor - able withdrawal from the professional or graduate school attended. An overall Grade Point Average (GPA) of a 2.50 (on a 4.0 scale) or higher must be achieved in order to be considered for transfer status or advanced standing. It is important to note that all transfer stu-dents must meet the entry level prerequisite requirements for first semester students re-College of Chiropractic80gardless of having been accepted to the in- stitution from which they are transferring. In many cases, UBCC's requirements are higher than those for other chiropractic and profes-sional schools. Prospective transfer students should note that an admissions application to UBCC is needed in order to begin a review for trans- fer credit. Students wishing to transfer must provide the Admissions Committee with an official transcript and a catalog from the chi- ropractic, professional or graduate school/s from which they are transferring, as well as a syllabus from each course for which the student is requesting transfer credit. Advanced Standing Students who are accepted as transfer stu-dents may receive advanced standing if a substantial number of semester hours have been accepted by UBCC. This could possi-bly enable the student to complete the D.C. program in less than 8 semesters. Transfer credit may be granted either with or without advanced standing, Effective Fall 2005, The University of Bridgeport College of Chiro- practic will grant no more than a maximum of 20% of advanced standing credit/hours towards our curriculum. A transfer student is eligible to receive no more than 42 transfer credits. Potential transfer students should be aware that in most cases they would have to complete approximately, 3 to 3 1/2 years at UBCC if accepted. If advanced standing is granted: 1. A special curriculum schedule will be made up for the student based on semes- ter hours transferred and course availabil- ity. 2. Tuition will be calculated based on the number of credits being taken per semes- ter multiplied by the single credit fee (if less than 14 credits per semester) at the time of the student's attendance. If advanced standing is not granted, but some semester hours are transferable, the student will be admitted to the first semester and will be exempt from courses for which transfer credit was granted.College of Chiropractic81College of Naturopathic Medicine Dean: Marcia Prenguber, N.D., FABNO Health Sciences Center 60 Telephone: (203) 576-4110 Fax: (203) 576-4107 E-mail: mprengub@bridgeport.edu Associate Dean Academic Health Sciences Center Telephone: (203) sdraus@bridgeport.edu Associate Dean for Clinical Education: Sciences E-mail: jmahfoud@bridgeport.edu Clinic Coordinator: 576-3450 E-mail: jholdorf@bridgeport.edu Dispensary Manager: 576-4298 E-mail: lnapoli@bridgeport.edu Assistant to the (203) Napoli, A. Ross, K. Sanders, D. Terfera, E. Zampieron Naturopathic medicine is a distinct profes- sion of primary health care that emphasizes prevention and treatment of disease, and promotion of optimal health and wellness through the use of natural therapies that en-hance the inherent healing wisdom of nature, the vis medicatrix naturae. Rooted in tradi- tion, naturopathic physicians utilize clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathy, physical medicine, and other natural modali-ties to help patients thrive. Most naturopathic physicians are in private practice, though op- portunities in group and integrative practice settings, research, and education are rapidly growing. The University of Bridgeport, Col-lege of Naturopathic Medicine (UBCNM) trains students to a broad scope of practice, to prepare students to practice across North America. Students are responsible for be- ing informed of licensure requirements and scope of practice in the legal jurisdiction in which they plan to practice. Degree Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (N.D.) Recognition and Memberships UBCNM is approved to offer the degree of Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine by the Con- necticut State Department of Higher Educa- tion. The College of Naturopathic Medicine program is accredited by the Council on Na-turopathic Medical Education (CNME).

Naturopathic medicine is distinguished by the principles upon which its practice is based. The principles are con- tinually reexamined in the light of scientific advances. The techniques of naturopathic medicine include modern and traditional, sci-entific and empirical methods. The following principles are the foundation of naturopathic medical practice: The Healing Power of Nature (vis medicatrix naturae): Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent self-healing process in the per - son which is ordered and intelligent. Naturo- pathic physicians act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to fa-cilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process. Identify and Treat the Causes (tolle causam): The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness, rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. First Do No Harm (primum non nocere): Na- turopathic physicians follow three guidelines to avoid harming a patient: Utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; Avoid when possible the harmful sup- pression of symptoms; Acknowledge, respect, and work with the individual's self-healing process. Doctor as Teacher (docere): Naturopathic physicians educate their patients and em-power them to take responsibility for their health. They also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient re-lationship. Treat the Whole Person: Naturopathic phy- sicians treat each patient by taking into ac-count individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other fac-tors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Prevention: Naturopathic physicians empha- size the prevention of disease \u2014 assessing risk factors, heredity, and susceptibility to disease and making appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness. Naturopathic medicine is committed to the creation of a healthy world in which humanity may thrive. PRACTICE Naturopathic Methods: Naturopathic medi- cine is defined by its principles. Diagnostic methods, treatments, and modalities are se- lected and applied based upon these prin- ciples in relationship to the unique individual needs of each patient. Naturopathic Practice: Naturopathic practice includes the following diagnostic and thera-peutic modalities: clinical nutrition; botani-cal medicine; naturopathic physical medicine including naturopathic manipulative therapy; public health measures and hygiene; health counseling; minor surgery; homeopathy; acupuncture; naturopathic obstetrics (natural childbirth); and laboratory assessment, diag-nostic imaging, and clinical diagnosis. Curriculum The academic and clinical curriculum at UBC-NM is an intensive four-year, full-time pro-gram that provides students with a foundation in the knowledge and skills essential to the practice of naturopathic medicine. This doc-toral degree prepares students for the Natu-ropathic Physicians Licensing Exam (NPLEX), required for state and provincial licensing ex-ams, and for the general practice of naturo-pathic medicine. The curriculum, instruction, and clinical ex- periences are designed to prepare graduates to be competent physicians offering com-prehensive healthcare using traditional and up-to-date methods and modalities in ac-cordance with the principles of Naturopathic Medicine. The first year of the program is de-voted to biomedical sciences and naturopath-ic philosophy. The second year of training is focused on clinical sciences and the begin-ning of coursework in therapeutic modalities. The last two years focus on naturopathic case management related to organ systems, special populations (e.g., pediatrics and geriatrics), and advanced study of therapeutic modalities. Clinical training begins during the second year of study, through observation of patient care. During the 3rd year of training, students provide a supportive role in patient care at the on-campus UB Clinics and off-site com-munity clinics in the surrounding area, under the supervision and direction of naturopathic physicians and other licensed physicians. To be eligible for clinical education training and credit, students must be in good academic standing, successfully complete required courses in Semesters I through IV, pass the Clinic Entrance Exam, and have current CPR certification. The course of study consists of four academic years each consisting of two 18-week semes-ters, as well as some summer and holiday clinic shifts. COURSE IDENTIFICATION All UBCNM courses are identified with the let- ter \"N\" as the first letter in the course descrip- tion, e.g., NBS 511 Anatomy I. Course identification is as follows: NBS Basic Sciences NBM Botanical Medicine NNT Clinical Nutrition NCS Clinical Sciences NHM Homeopathic Medicine NNP Naturopathic Practice/Organ System NPP Naturopathic Principles and Practice NTCM Naturopathic Traditional Chinese Medicine NPM Physical Medicine NPS Psychology NRS Research NCE Clinical Education As a general rule, the course numbering sys-tem is as follows: 500 level \u2014 courses offered in year one 600 level \u2014 courses offered in year two 700 level \u2014 courses offered in year three 800 level \u2014 courses offered in year four The second digit identifies the semester the course is given in that academic year.

Some, but not all, licensing jurisdictions require a specific minimum number of didactic hours for the practice of` these specialties. Currently, the following courses are offered as electives by the college: NNP 712 Generative Medicine I Generative xxx TCM IIINTCM xxx TCM IV GRADES Grades earned by students are submitted to the Registrar utilizing the following designa- tions. Grades earned are on a four (4)-point scale with an \"A\" or 4 quality points being the highest grade attained. GRADE QUALITY POINTS A 4.0 B+ 3.5 B 3.0 C+ 2.5C 2.0 F 0.0 The cumulative quality point ratio (QPR) is determined by dividing the number of semes-College of Naturopathic Medicine84ter hours into the number of points earned. Transfer credits are not included in this com- putation. Clinic Grades are: Satisfactory (S) or Failure (F). Refer to the UBCNM Student Handbook for policies regarding a grade of \"F\". Administrative Grades In addition to the Academic Grades submit- ted by faculty, the following Administrative Grades are also utilized: I (Incomplete), TCR (Transfer Credit), and W (Withdrawal). I: The grade of Incomplete (I) may be requested by a student and is used by the faculty, with the prior approval of the Associate Dean, to indicate that a student has not completed all course requirements for approved reasons. These include documented medical emergencies of the student or immedi- ate family member. To be eligible for an Incomplete, a stu-dent must have attended a minimum of 75% of the course hours. The faculty member and the Associate Dean may approve the student's request for an Incomplete. Upon approval, the fac-ulty member and Associate Dean will determine the time granted to com- plete the course requirements. Once the student has completed course re- quirements within the approved time frame, the faculty member will submit the earned grade. If the requirements are not completed within the ap- proved time frame, the course grade will be converted from an \"I\" to an \"F\". Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will not be eligible to register for courses for which that course is a pre- requisite without approval by the As- sociate Dean of Academic Affairs. TCR: Transfer credit granted for equivalent graduate work completed at another accredited institution. W: Withdrawal grades are assigned on the following policy statements: If a student officially withdraws from a course during the official change-of-registration period, that course does not appear on the student's transcript. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the end of the change- of-registration period, but before the end of the official withdrawal period, a grade of \"W\" is assigned and that course remains on the student's tran-script. Courses with a grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR. The names of students who have of- ficially withdrawn from a course and receive the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the balance of the semester. Any exceptions must be approved by the Associate Dean of Academic Af- fairs. Academic Policies See the UBCNM Student Handbook for the most current and complete description of Col- lege policies and procedures. ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS Each student is expected to attend all lectures and laboratories and other activities asso- ciated with the total completion of a given course. Certain courses are offered on eve-nings and weekends. A detailed description of the attendance poli- cy can be found in each course syllabus. REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATION In order to be eligible for graduation from UBCNM, candidates must: 1. Complete all requirements of the educa- tional program with a minimum 2.50 cu-mulative grade point average. 2. Receive a recommendation for gradua-tion by the UBCNM Faculty and Admin-istration. 3. Fulfill financial obligations to the College and University Office of Financial Aid. 4. Complete, at a minimum, the last three semesters in residence at UBCNM, by transfer and/or advanced-standing stu-dents. All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within seven years from the first matriculation to graduation. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS A student is considered to be meeting sat- isfactory academic progress by maintaining a QPR of 2.5 or greater with no outstand- ing grade of \"F\". Good academic standing is achieved when a student maintains a GPA of 2.5, has met all financial responsibilities to the College, and is free of any breach of the stan-dards governing ethical and clinical conduct. Academic Probation, Remediation, and Dismissal ACADEMIC PROBATION Academic probation occurs when the stu- dent's GPA or QPR falls below 2.50, or the student has a grade of \"F\" in one or more courses. A student who is on Academic Pro-bation is not in good academic standing, and may not be allowed to carry a full academic course load. In addition, a student on Aca-demic Probation may not be allowed to par - ticipate in the UBCNM clinic, outreach clinic sites, preceptorships, or any activities associ-ated with clinical education. A student on Ac- ademic Probation must meet with the Associ- ate Dean of Academic Affairs to create a plan for successful completion of the program. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL A student who, after one semester of Aca-demic Probation, does not show substantial improvement in his or her academic perfor - mance may be subject to dismissal from the program. Additionally, Academic Dismissal may occur if a student is placed on Academic Probation for a second time, for any reason. A student whose GPA falls below 2.0 at any time may be subject to dismissal from the program. Any student who is subject to dis-missal may appeal to the Dean (see Appeals and Disciplinary Action). NON-ACADEMIC DISMISSAL FROM THE COLLEGE Naturopathic medical students are expected to demonstrate ethical and professional be- havior at all times. The following incidents may be cause for dismissal from the program: 1. Failure to meet the generally accepted standards of professional conduct and clinical practice. Dismissal of this nature is subject to a review of a committee of peers, faculty, and administration. 2. Pleading guilty or \"no contest,\" or being found guilty of any crime involving mor - al turpitude or being felonious in nature. 3. Repeated violation of public policy, or the demonstration of behavior that creates safety hazards and/or disrupts the order of the institution. 4. Failure to meet financial obligations or commitments to the College. See the College Student Handbook for a com-plete description of policies and procedures for Non-Academic Dismissal.College of Naturopathic Medicine85LEAVE OF ABSENCE AND WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PROGRAM If a student requests a Leave of Absence (LOA) from UBCNM, and is in good academic and financial standing with the College, s/he is eligible for readmission for up to one year from the date the leave begins. After one year, the LOA expires and the student must reap- ply for admission to the College through the Admissions Office. A Medical Leave requires medical documen- tation from a physician that states that the stu-dent must take leave to recover from illness or injury. Before returning to the program the student must provide medical clearance that allows full participation in academic and clini- cal activities. After one year, the student must reapply for admission to the College through the University Admissions Office. A student who withdraws from the University must reapply for admission to the College in order to be readmitted to the program. If a student fails to register for a semester without applying for an official LOA at any time be- fore completion of the naturopathic program, s/he is considered to have withdrawn from the program. If a student takes leave one or more times from the program, the cumulative absences must not exceed three years. LOA or Withdrawal requires the student to complete all required paperwork from the University's Registrar and Financial Aid Office. READMISSION TO THE PROGRAM A student on Leave of Absence from UBCNM who intends to return to the program must notify the Dean in writing and reapply for ad- mission through the University's Admissions Office at least one month before the begin- ning of the semester of anticipated return.

Description The Fones School of Dental Hygiene, estab-lished in 1949 at the University of Bridge- port, was named for Dr. Alfred Civilion Fones, the dentist who was instrumental in creating the profession of dental hygiene in 1913. Accredited since the American Dental Association publication of September, 1953, the Fones program is in full accord with the principles established by the Commission on Dental Accreditation, a specialized ac-crediting body recognized by the Council on Post-Secondary Accreditation and the United States Department of Education. The gradu-ate is eligible for National, Regional, and State examinations in each of the fifty United States, and students earning the Associate's degree may apply their credits towards a Bachelor's degree. Accreditation The A.S., B.S., and M.S.D.H. degree programs in Dental Hygiene are both licensed and ac- credited by the State of Connecticut Office of Higher Education. Qualifications for Admissions The following physical qualifications are re-quired for participation in the Associate de- gree program at the UB Fones School of Den- tal Hygiene. These qualifications are essential for the preparation of AS Degree in Dental Hygiene. Students at the School must be able to perform at a high level of competency in all phases of classroom, clinic, and labora-tory activities as they will ultimately use the knowledge attained as dental hygienists. Applications for admittance to the A.S. and B.S. degree programs are received on indi- vidual merit. Applicants who show potential for the dental hygiene program, but do not meet criteria may be offered entrance into pre-dental hygiene. All admitted students are subject to a background check. This pro- cedure is conducted by the outside agency Verified Credentials, Inc. All information is maintained confidentially. The applicant student must process: 1. Critical thinking ability sufficient for judg- ment during clinical activities. 2. Communication abilities for effective in- teraction verbally and in written form with patients and other members of the health care team. 3. Coordination and use of both upper and lower limbs as required for, among other skills, the performance of dental hygiene clinical procedures and emergency skills such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 4. Manual dexterity necessary for perfor - mance in the various clinical, dental laboratory, and basic science laboratories without posing a threat to her/himself pa-tients, or her/his fellow students' safety and well-being. 5. Hearing and visual abilities, appropriately assisted, acute enough to allow the indi- vidual recordation of patient histories, to provide routine safety instructions, and perform stethoscopic and other ausculta- tory examinations, and to read all forms of diagnostic imaging so that she/he can adequately interpret normal, abnormal, and pathologic changes. 6. Freedom from communicable diseases sufficient for rending safe and effective dental hygiene care. 7. Ability to obtain a dental hygiene license as some states deny licenses for certain prior felony convictions. Applicants with disabilities will neither be summarily denied admission, nor will high- er scholastic requirements be demanded of them. All persons to be eligible for ac-ceptance to the School must be capable of demonstrating upon request their ability to perform classroom, laboratory, and clinical assignments, including microscopic work, x-ray interpretation and techniques, or the equivalent, pass written, oral, and practical examinations and meet all of the require-ments of the School as they evolve. It is the responsibility of the applicant/student to assess compliance with these requirements. By submitting an application to the University of Bridgeport, Fones School of Dental Hy-giene, the applicant is confirming their abil- ity to meet qualifications for entrance into the Fones School of Dental Hygiene program. General Criteria for the A.S. and the B.S. Degree in Dental Hygiene The two year basic core curriculum of the Fones School combines courses from the College of Arts and Sciences and the Fones School of Dental Hygiene to provide a broad educational preparation. In addition to ba- sic and dental science theory, the program provides education in preventive service and dental health education. During the second year, the students receive clinical education at the Fones Dental Health Center on campus, and through assignments to the clinical and educational facilities of school dental health programs, hospitals and community agencies. These assignments are directly supervised by Fones faculty. Stu- dents are responsible for providing their own transportation to community agencies. A student who earns a grade of C- or below in a course in the major field, must obtain a written statement from the School Director specifying the procedure necessary to rem- edy the deficiency and remain in the major. Enrollment in the second year is contingent on completing all first year requirements and achieving a QPR of 2.0. Education at the baccalaureate level en- hances the dental hygienists' opportunities, abilities, background and values. The pro- fessional dental hygiene curriculum is com-bined with a liberal arts education. Upon satisfactory completion of 122-125 credits in the areas of study specified, the student will be recommended for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene. Students in the Bachelor of Science degree (B.S.) may integrate the Bachelor's courses with the clinical aspect of the Dental Hy-giene curriculum or pursue a Baccalaureate degree (B.S.) after completing clinical prepa- ration at the Associate in Science Certificate 89Level. This Baccalaureate degree comple- tion approach is available to Fones' students and graduates of a Dental Hygiene program that is accredited by a specialized accredit-ing agency recognized by the Council on Post Secondary Accreditation and the United States Department of Education. All courses listed in the major program sec- tion of the catalog for the Associate in Sci-ence and/or Bachelor of Science degree are required for graduation. The majority of Dental Hygiene courses may be taken dur - ing the regular academic year. Dental Hygiene Bachelor of Science Degree Online Program The online B.S. in Dental Hygiene from The Fones School of Dental Hygiene at the University of Bridgeport offers an oppor - tunity for dental hygienists to further their education beyond the A.S. degree. Dental hygienists traditionally begin their profes- sional work following completion of the A.S. degree. The University of Bridgeport's B.S. in Dental Hygiene online degree program makes it possible for dental hygienists to work toward a degree at any time, from any- where in the world. The program is perfectly suited to adult learners who have the dis-cipline for part-time, self-directed study un- der the guidance of qualified faculty in their field. The BSDH Online Program is identical to the on-campus degree completion pro- gram and is designed to be completed en- tirely online. Students who hold an A.S. or certificate in Dental Hygiene from an institution accredit- ed by the American Dental Association Com-mission on Dental Accreditation are eligible for admission. A maximum of 73 credits from accredited two-year colleges and 90 credits from accredited four-year institutions. The program consists of 122 credit hours which include applicable transfer credits (60-90 credit hours), general education courses (40 credit hours), dental hygiene courses (24 credit hours), and elective courses (12 cred- it hours). The last 30 credit hours must be completed through the University of Bridge-port. The general education courses include University Core Requirements in English, Math, Fine Arts, Integrated Studies, Humani-ties, Natural Science, Social Science, and Capstone Seminar. Students who are graduates of the Fones School of Dental Hygiene, need not re-apply for admission.

Classes are held on- line via the interactive Canvas system or via weekend only campus classes. The program is designed to be completed in 28 consecu- tive months if two classes are taken per cycle. Graduation is contingent upon completing the program and passing the comprehensive exam within 5 years from program start date. Students must remain in the program they enrolled in (online or on campus). UB does require some courses to be taken online by all students. ATTENDANCE CAMPUS WEEkEND FORMAT Each class period represents 20% of a four credit course or 25% or a three-credit course. Class attendance and participation are in- dispensable parts of the educational pro-cess that are required throughout the pro- gram. Since classes only meet 4 or 5 times, depending on whether the course is 3 or 4 credits, it is imperative that students attend class. In the event of absence due to illness or family emergency, please notify the Assis-tant Director and the instructor immediately. If more than one class is missed during the semester for either a 3 or 4 credit course you will receive a failing grade for the class and will have to repeat it. This includes absences for illness. Make-up examinations due to absence WILL NOT will not be permitted without an approved legitimate excuse with full documentation (see makeup policies) and will result in a grade of zero for that exam. Students ARE NOT PERMITTED to leave class prior to 5pm unless prior authori-zation is received from the Assistant Director and this would require the same guidelines for approval as an absence. Prior approval must be sought during normal administra- tion business hours Monday - Friday. Those who leave class early without prior approval or subsequent documentation of illness or emergency that meet the guidelines speci- fied under makeup policies below will be penalized with a 20% grade deduction on their course grade. MAkE-UP POLICIES WEEkEND CAMPUS AND ONLINE FORMAT Make-up examinations and assignments will not be permitted without a legitimate excuse or prior approval from the instructor and as- sistant director and will result in a grade of zero. An acceptable excuse for prolonged illness, or family emergency, entitling a stu- dent to a make-up examination, requires a legitimate detailed doctor's note (with diag- nosis) by a U.S. licensed physician or official documentation of family emergency, which must be submitted to the Program Assistant Director and approved. Please note that only one make-up examination is allowed per course regardless of instructor approval. Missed exams must be taken before the next scheduled examination and may be modi-fied and made more difficult by the instruc- tor. Make-ups will not be granted for reasons of personal convenience, such as traveling, weddings and vacations. GRADING POLICY Online exams are timed. Your syllabus should define for you the time limit on the exam as well as when you log onto Canvas to complete it. Your are permitted to log onto the exam only ONCE and complete it in the required time frame. Students cannot log in and out of exams. Once submitted, the exam cannot be accessed again. Time limits set by the professors must be adhered to. Students who exceed the time limit on the exam, (this is reported to the instructor automatically) will receive a grading penalty equal to the percentage of excess time they took. For example, if an exam was sched- uled for 60 minutes and the student took 66 minutes to complete it, they would have exceeded the exam time by 10%. Therefore their exam grade would be penalized 10% of the total possible points for the exam. If exam was 100 points, then 10% would equal a 10 point deduction. Repeated violations of exam time may result in further grading pen-alties and will be reported to the program assistant director for review.

EVALUATION AND GRADING The GPA is determined based on the follow-ing scale. A = 4.00, A- = 3.67, B+ = 3.33, B = 3.00, B- = 2.67, C+ = 2.33, C = 2.00, C- = 1.67, D+ = 1.33, D = 1.00, I = Incomplete, W = Withdrawal, R = Research in progress. Any course with a grade of C- or a numerical grade of 73 or less must be repeated to earn graduate credit. Other courses may be re- peated if the student needs to raise the GPA. When a course is repeated, only the second grade will used to calculate the GPA. Tuition must be paid again for all classes that are re-quired to be re-taken (no exceptions). Evalu-ation and grading are the responsibility and province of the professor. All students in a course will be graded consistently or equiva- lently. Students may be penalized for late or missed work. Questions regarding grades should be addressed to the course professor. GRADE DISPUTES A disputed grade may be appealed in writing as follows: First Appeal: Directly to the instructor within 30 days of receipt of grade Second Appeal: To Assistant Director of Nu- trition Institute Third Appeal: To Director of Nutrition Insti- tute/Vice Provost of Health Sciences Final Appeal: To the Provost TRANSFER CREDITS The Program Director, with the Dean's ap- proval, may allow up to six semester hours (eight hours in the case of laboratory cours- es) of graduate transfer credits from a region- ally accredited college or university. The courses being considered for transfer must have been completed within the past seven years, with a grade of \"B\" or better, and be comparable to the University of Bridgeport's graduate courses. Physicians (i.e.: medical, osteopathic, chiropractic, naturopathic, etc.) may request advanced standing for 560A and 560B. However, many choose to take 560B (Biochemistry) if they have not had the course in many years, as a review and prep- aration for course 560D (Clinical Biochemis-try). Advanced transfer credit for physicians will only be granted for courses where a grade of \"B\" or better was achieved. INCOMPLETE COURSEWORk An \"I\" (Incomplete) designates incomplete work at the time of grading for reasons be- yond the control of the student, fully docu- mented, and corresponding to UB makeup policies as stated above, and determined to be bona-fide by the instructor and the As- sistant Program Director. If approved by the assistant director and the instructor, incom-plete coursework must be completed by the end of the semester immediately following the one in which the incomplete was grant-ed. If the work has not been completed and no grade has been submitted as indicated, the grade automatically becomes F. STU-DENTS WHO ARE FAILING A COURSE ARE Nutrition Institute95NOT PERMITTED TO TAKE AN INCOMPLETE AND REPEAT THE COURSE TO ATTAIN A NEW GRADE. A GRADE OF \"F\" WILL BE IS-SUED AND THE COURSE WILL HAVE TO BE REPEATED BY RE-REGISTERING FOR THE COURSE. GOOD ACADEMIC STANDING PROBATION AND SEPARATION Good academic standing is achieved when a student maintains a 3.0 GPA. If the GPA drops below 3.0, the student will be placed on academic probation. A student, who re-ceives a second grade of \"D\" or \"F\" in any course, or is placed on probation in two dif- ferent semesters, will be separated from the program. In cases of academic probation, the student should consult with the Program Assistant Director for advice and planning to raise the GPA. In cases of separation from the program, a student may make a writ- ten appeal to the Director within ten days of the notification of separation. If an ap- peal is granted, the student will remain on academic probation and his progress will be monitored periodically during the semester. RESEARCH IN NUTRITION - COURSE 560J The research project can be taken as an elec- tive, and is not required, as part of the Hu- man Nutrition Program. The project can be a literature-based study or an original research project. Students have one semester to com- plete the project before incurring a fee. If thesis completion exceeds the one semester limit, the student must maintain continuous matriculation by registering for ADMIN 600, each semester, until the thesis has been com-pleted. Graduation Requirements The minimum number of credits required for graduation is 41; the minimum GPA required is 3.0. Students are expected to complete class work for the degree within five years of initial enrollment in the program. Successful completion of ALL sections of the comprehensive competency examination is required for graduation. This examination and all required re-takes are given on-site on the UB campus on a Saturday (exact dates published several months prior to each ex- amination) and will not be given by proctor at other sites or on alternate days of the week (no exceptions). If you cannot take exami-nations on a Saturday for any reason please consider the above policy before entering the program. Study guides and sample ques- tions will be available to all students eligible to sit the examination by the distance learn- ing department. Any sections that are not successfully completed must be re-taken on the UB campus at assigned dates. Only two attempts will be allowed without remedia- tion, as assigned by the program director.

General Criteria for the RN to BSN Degree in Nursing The RN to BSN applicant must complete an application for admission and provide all of- ficial transcripts from all college/university/ diploma programs attended. Sixty-four cred-its of basic nursing and general education credits from an accredited college or ac- credited diploma program with a 2.75GPA is required to be accepted into the program. Ninety credits may be transferred from ac- credited four-year institution. The length of time to complete the BSN program is contin- gent on the number of transferred credits ac- cepted and the number of general education courses that need to be taken. The 27 credits of upper level RN to BSN program courses and the 3 credit Capstone 390 seminar were designed so they can be completed in one calendar year plus one summer course by taking 2 online courses per 8 week session once all pre-requisite courses are completed. The pace is determined by the student but the BSN degree should be completed within 7 years of matriculation. The RN to BSN student must maintain a GPA of 2.5 or higher to be eligible for graduation. A student who fails a nursing course may repeat that course and the second grade re- places the first grade for the computation of the QPA. Both course grades will remain on the official transcript. The student who falls below the minimum required GPA will col-laborate with a faculty advisor to formulate a professional improvement plan that will outline steps to achieving the required GPA. The grade for a course repeated more than twice will be the average of all the grades earned each time the course was taken. All repeated courses will be so indicated on the transcript. The University of Bridgeport poli- cies and standards for the Academic Status of Students and Academic Separation (Catalog 2014-2016, page 30) for undergraduate de- gree programs will apply for students who are not maintaining the required academic progress. 101School of Professional Studies Dean: Dr. Timothy Laynor Wahlstrom Library, Garden Level 126 (203) 576-4537 E-mail: scpsinfo@bridgeport.edu School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS) serves the public by facili-tating access to the University's knowledge and resources through credit and noncredit courses and alternative methods of teaching and learning, and by aiding adult lifelong learners and organizations to become more competitive, improve their earning power, and enrich their lives.

ELI also organizes off-campus trips and on-campus activities designed to introduce international students to the United States, its language and its people. ELI classes are offered year round, Monday through Friday. Full-time students attend class in the mornings and afternoons. Part-time stu-dents can choose to attend mornings or af- ternoons. For full-time students, a typical day consists of 5 hours of instruction, including classroom instruction in grammar, composi- tion, reading, listening, and speaking, and assigned work in the university's state-of-the-art language laboratory. ELI provides highly individualized instruction. Classes are limited to 15 students per teacher. ELI students receive a University of Bridge- port student I.D. card and are entitled to use facilities on the campus of the University of Bridgeport, such as the Wahlstrom Library and the Wheeler Recreation Center, to name but a few. Admission ELI students must have a strong personal commitment to learning the English language. Courses in English as a Second Language are offered year-round at all levels from beginner through advanced.

Why Students Enroll at ELI Many students wish to enrich their knowl- edge of the English language while on leave from a school or a job in their home country. Most of these students return to their home country after a stay at ELI of from 7 weeks to a full year or more. Many ELI students plan to apply for admis- sion to a degree program at the University of Bridgeport. They improve their knowledge of English to meet the English language re-quirement for university admission. These students usually obtain \"conditional accep- tance\" to a degree program and will receive full acceptance when they satisfy the Uni- versity's English language requirement for admission. It should be noted that successful completion of ELI's advanced level satisfies the English language requirement for ad- mission to the University of Bridgeport. ELI graduates are not required to take the TOEFL or IELTS. The Curriculum The curriculum of ELI focuses on improving skills in speaking, listening comprehension, writing, and reading. At all levels of the cur - riculum, ELI instructors seek to help students improve their language skills through active use of the language both in and out of the classroom. New students complete a placement test upon arrival and are placed in the appropriate level of English. Successful completion of the ses- sion allows the student to move up to the next level. Students who are placed in the lower levels concentrate on basic grammar, speaking, lis-tening, and reading skills, and practice para- graph writing. As students progress through the levels, they continue to improve their speaking and listening skills while taking on more challenging tasks in reading and writing. In the advanced levels, students strive to achieve competence in language-dependent tasks similar to those that are required of na- tive speakers of English in both academic and career-related activities. These include read- ing for content; note-taking from spoken and written materials; speaking skills needed to relate information, to persuade, to negotiate, and to inquire; and skills needed in essay and report writing, as well as in effective corre-spondence. Graduates of ELI receive a \"Certificate of Com- pletion\" which certifies that they have met the English language requirement for admission to the University of Bridgeport. Grades reports are issued upon request. Schedule of Charges Please see insert for current academic year for tuition, fees, and other expense. ELI students should plan on spending about $200 per 8-week session to cover required books and miscellaneous personal expenses such as recreational travel, local transporta- tion, books, laundry, clothing, etc. Application Forms and Additional Information Prospective students may obtain application forms, credit card charge forms, insurance information, etc. at ELI's Internet site, by email, or by calling or faxing ELI.103Ernest C.

To this end the University has established a Pre-Law and a Pre-Health advisory program. Pre-Law Studies Advisor: Timothy Mandeville Fax: (203) 576-4388 E-mail: traynor@bridgeport.edu While no single curricular path is the ideal preparation for law school, a broadly based undergraduate program that includes train - ing in analytical reasoning and writing will serve you well. Law schools want students who can think, read, and write and who have some understanding of the forces that have shaped human experience. You can ac - quire these attributes in any number of col - lege courses, whether in the humanities, the social sciences, or the natural sciences. English language and literature courses are virtually indispensable. At the same time, ev - ery law student should be aware of the in - stitutional processes of government through which much of the law is made and applied. You can gain this awareness through study in political science. Because the law is insepara - ble from our historic experience, you should have some acquaintance with American his - tory. The fact that many legal subjects are in - timately concerned with economic relations among individuals, and with the structure and development of business enterprises, makes a knowledge of macro and microeco - nomics valuable. Statistics, accounting, and computer science are other courses that will help you to understand special legal subjects and the practice of law. Accredited law schools require that appli - cants take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). In the admissions process, law schools are primarily interested in the stu - dent's LSAT score, the student's GPA, and the intensity and depth of the student's un - dergraduate program, showing the student's capacity to perform well at an academically rigorous level.For more information on pre-law studies, check out the Law School Admission Coun - cil at www.lsac.org. Pre-Health Professional Studies Advisor to Pre-Health: Spiros Katsifis Charles Dana Hall 169 Fax: (203) 576-4262 E-mail: for General Studies Majors: Edward Geist Bryant Hall 271 Avenue Telephone: (203) 576-4956 Fax: 576-4051 Virtually all of the professional schools in these fields have the same minimum en - trance requirements: 1. Completion of 90 credit hours of college work or completion of a bachelor's de- gree, 2. Completion of laboratory science courses in the following subjects: Biology - 8 credit hours General Chemistry - 8 credit hours Organic Chemistry - 8 credit hours General Physics - 8 credit hours 3. Completion of a liberal arts core that in-cludes English composition, psychology, communications, humanities, social sci-ences, and the fine arts. Depending on the health profession and school some variation in these requirements does occur. The highest percentage of students admit - ted to health professional graduate schools major in biology with chemistry the second most common major. However, students ma - joring in any discipline, e.g. history, music, or psychology, are also viable candidates provided they satisfy the pre-requisites of the professional school to which they seek admission. The University of Bridgeport's Biology Major offers a B.A. or B.S. degree that provides a rigorous scientific and technical program for the pre-health professional student. See the Biology major for additional details. The University of Bridgeport's Bachelor of Science in General Studies (B.S.) degree program provides the student with the op - portunity to create a program, in consulta - tion with their advisor, that may fit the indi - vidual student's particular needs. The University offers a pre-Chiropractic pro - gram in the Biology major and the General Studies major. These programs are offered with the cooperation of the University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic. In both programs the student may elect a 90-Credit Basic Option, Combined Baccalaureate/ Doctor of Chiropractic Option, or Complete Baccalaureate followed by Doctor of Chiro - practic Option. See the description of the pre-chiropractic program elsewhere in the catalog. A pre-Naturopathic program is also of - fered in cooperation with the University of Bridgeport's College of Naturopathic Medi - cine. In this program a student must com - plete the bachelor's degree before entering the College of Naturopathic Medicine. See the description of this program elsewhere in the catalog. It should be noted that pre-health pro - fessional study in any of the above areas provides an excellent foundation for other careers in the health sciences, including os - teopathy, podiatry, physical therapy, optom - etry, and pharmacy. 105Pre-Professional Programs for Chiropractic The University of Bridgeport offers a pre- professional program for students preparing for Chiropractic College, the Pre-Chiroprac - tic Program for undergraduate students. This program fulfills the prerequisites for all Chi - ropractic colleges in the United States and Canada, including the University of Bridge - port College of Chiropractic. Pre-Chiropractic Programs Three undergraduate options of pre-chi - ropractic are offered in the Biology and General Studies majors: 90-Credit Basic Op - tion, Combined Baccalaureate/Doctor of Chi - ropractic Option, and Complete Baccalaureate Followed by Doctor of Chiropractic Option. In both majors the student earns a bachelor's degree which provides requirements for en - trance into Chiropractic school. The University of Bridgeport's Biology ma - jor offers both the B.S. and B.A. degrees. The major provides a rigorous scientific and technical program for the pre-Chiropractic student.
