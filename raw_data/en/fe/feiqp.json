Over the course of the 40-minute session, we will progress from a state of outer stability and stillness to an exercise in self-directed loving kindness, which helps us find a firm ground in meaningful aspirations. From there, we will move into the realm of universal loving kindness, strengthening our sense of connection to our communities, and, eventually, to all who live. All the proceeds from this session will be donated to the relief effort for Ukrainian refugees. "}
