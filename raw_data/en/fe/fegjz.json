One in April of last year and the other in August. Both were after being on birth control (tri-cyclen lo, to be exact) for 3 months. I stopped taking my birth control after my seizure in April, but I didn't really think anything of it. I wasn't seeing anyone at the time so I just didn't really want it in my system. I started taking my birth control again in June after I met a new guy. After I had the seizure in August (late August) I started to think maybe it was caused by my birth control. The neurologist that was assigned to me said that it was entirely 100% impossible, but my family physician told me there was always a chance. I have been completely off my birth control since that last seizure and have not been taking any medications either. I feel a lot healthier and I haven't had a single problem since then, but the neurologist still will not listen to my input about why I think this happened. I sat down with one of my girl friends that also has epilepsy and told her what was going on. She told me that the same thing happened to her when she started taking the pill but that none of the neurologists here believed her. She went to a husband and wife team in Quebec (way far away) and they told her that it was entirely possible that it was her birth control that caused it. Anyways, has this happened to anyone else?

I just wanted to know if there were more people out there that had had something like this happen. Both of my seizures were grand mal. And lasted around 10 minutes a piece. I have completely stopped the pill since august. thanks again Thank you for replying. I just wanted to know if there were more people out there that had had something like this happen.

Submitted by DAA on Sun, 2008-04-20 - 14:11 My 17 year old daughter experienced her first seizure last week and I have tons of questions. She had been on the pill for 3 1/2 weeks (Nortrel). There were other variables, she was on her senior class trip, was awake all night, flew for the first time in years (was nervous about it), hadn't eaten much, got off the plane in FL and had grand mal seizure 15 minutes later. She was hospitalized and had an extensive workup including EEG that shows a risk for further seizures. One of the doctors on the team mentioned a possible connection between the pill and the seizure, but others felt it was not significant. Actually, another doctor thought she should remain on the pill! We are seeing a neurologist tomorrow, and I am anxious to hear what she has to say. My pharmacist said \"anything is possible\". Would love to hear experiences of others. My 17 year old daughter experienced her first seizure last week and I have tons of questions. She had been on the pill for 3 1/2 weeks (Nortrel).

Submitted by jen09 on Mon, 2009-06-22 - 21:36 I had seizures when I was a child between the ages of 10-12, but then they went away for almost ten years. Then I had 3 more between the ages of 19-25. When I had my first, I wasn't on the IUD, but my body was under a lot of stress since I just had my first baby, wasn't getting enough sleep, and was working long hours. With my other two seizures, I was on the IUD, and had several 1 second seizures. Between the ages of 25-31 wasn't on the IUD and no remember having any seizures of any kind. Now that I'm on the IUD, I'm experiencing the 1 second seirzures during my period. Now after reading your comments, I have come to the conclusion that for me, the IUD is part of my problem. I'm making an appointment this week to have it removed asp! Oh, and it was interesting to read that estrogen causes them too because I've been drinking flaxseed oil and green tea which are loaded with estrogen.

Submitted by Rodzenjr on Fri, 2009-09-11 - 18:03 I have to say...Green tea is not leaded with estrogen. Does green tea contain estrogens? No, there is no estrogen in green tea. In fact, there are numerous studies showing that green tea helps lower the levels of estrogen circulating in the blood, and may reduce a person's risk of developing estrogen-dependent cancers such as breast and uterine cancer. [http://www.greentealibrary.com/Ask%20a%20Question.htm](http://www.greentealibrary.com/Ask%20a%20Question.htm) I personally don't think Flaxseed oil is loaded with estrogen either. So I think you are fine. And there is a study that does say one of the Catechins in green tea can help lower the incidence of seizures (this was an animal study though). But of course it isn't a substitute for meds. It should be used to supplement them though. Plus, green tea is one of the most potent sources of antioxidants around. It has very wide-ranging health benefits that can hardly be beat. I would highly recommend you buy the book Green Tea (the Natural Source for a Healthier Life) by Nadine Taylor M.S., R.D. She is a Registered Dietician and is very knowledgeable about alternative healing. But if you have hormone-related seizures, you might want to get off of birth control pills as fast as possible.

Submitted by jencas16 on Sat, 2008-09-27 - 18:26 Whatever is going on, changing hormones have everything to do with seizures. After my gyno, a good friend of my mother's, found out about my most recent grand mal (all of which have been on my period), he put me on birth control (femcon) but prescribed me to skip the inert pills in order to skip my period and even out my hormones on a constant basis. My husband and I had planned on having our second child soon, but until both my gyno and neuro agree that my epilepsy is under control, they will not approve such a hormonal upheaval. Once we do have our second child, we plan on a tougher form of BC to take away my period, thus taking away the target zone for my seizures. Everyone is different. For me BC is essential, for others, the opposite. JME - Diagnosed in 2000 Whatever is going on, changing hormones have everything to do with seizures.

If you believe your birth control is contributing to your seizures, GET OFF OF IT. All of these experiences cannot be a coincidence. We are still trying to find a neurologist who is willing to look at the cause of the seizure in lieu of treating the symptoms in the Chicago area. Some look very promising. Also, when I contacted the FDA they indicated that no one has reported any adverse reactions as they relate to birth control and seizures. You can help many other young women by reporting your experiences to the FDA at [http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/how.htm](http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/how.htm). Ladies! Be your own best friend.

Submitted by sparker001 on Mon, 2008-09-29 - 16:12 Hi - I don't know if they can be \"caused\" by being on birth control, but mine all started after I stopped birth control (I'd been on it from age 14 until age 40 - I stopped it, then after a few months started it again, and then stopped it again. And after that, for the first time in my life, I started having full-blown seizures. I'd had what were apparently complex partial seizures - TLE's - since 2 yrs before that, but never thought much of them since I thought they were related to spiritual/mystical experiences I was having, and didn't think they had much to do with anything medical, plus I never got dizzy or lost consciousness. But after stopping the pill and my hormones getting so crazy, the complex partial seizures seguewayed into generalized seizures that landed me in the hospital, flipped me out of bed, etc. Now I'm back on the pill plus taking meds (Trileptal) and now instead of having full blown generalized seizures every month or so, they are down to maybe every 5-6 months, which I can live with! I think the issue is that hormonal fluctuations can be a cause, I believe that is what they call catamineal (sp?) seizures. I think there are different ways of looking at seizures and finding the right neurologist is so critical. One neurologist just wanted me to take the meds and that was it, but another thought it made much more sense to get back on the pill to regulate my hormones, plus take the meds. Once I did that, that is when the attacks were much less frequent. Not sure if that really answers your question, but perhaps sheds light on one aspect of it! :) Hi - I don't know if they can be \"caused\" by being on birth control, but mine all started after I stopped birth control (I'd been on it from age 14 until age 40 - I stopped it, then after a few months started it again, and then stopped it again.

My 1st neurologist just wanted me on the AED's, but a second one ( who I think has more common sense ) wanted me to be on both. Before I went to the second neurologist, I was having complex partials that seguewayed into generalized tonic clonic seizures every month or two, but now it's every 5 or 6 months. I always have mine around my period, so mine are cateminial (sp?) seizures. Apart from the hormonal aspect, some BIG triggers for me are lack of sleep, not eating enough, and stress. I sleep at least 8 hrs every night, I try to make a point of eating as soon as I feel hungry, and not letting that dazed kind of hunger feeling last for too long, as it can go right into a complex partial that could go full-blown tonic clonic. And stress is a biggie, trying to not let things get to me too much. I hear a lot of people mention lack of sleep and stress as triggers, but I haven't heard people mention not eating enough, which could possibly mean low blood sugar.

Submitted by Musicalgirl on Sun, 2009-08-02 - 01:52 I was on the pill for a few months in 2007 before I saw one of the medications had in it a medication I'm not to go anywhere near for it will only make my epilepsy worse and that was 'Phenolanolin'. If anyone is taking the medication Dilantin the medical name is 'phenytoin' don't go anywhere near 'phenolanolin' as it can cause major seizures mixing with all your other meds so make sure you check it over with your doctor or pharmacist. If your doctor puts you on any birth contol pill make sure that you know whats in it first otherwise it could kill either or both you and your baby!!!! Keep your eyes open!!!!

Added a new med with the others I was taking and they got under control now for four years. I started taking BC when I was 19. Had my first petit mal when I was 22. Now i'm 37 with freedom finally.

The gyno told me there was no way that the BC caused my 2 seizures...but that was the only thing that had changed and i just know it was...I'm not a DR, nor do i claim to be, but sometimes i just wish they would listen to me...I know MY body a little bit!

I had 6 seizures while using the patch. My first thought was epilepsy so i went to a DR. who scanned me and told me, \"There is nothing wrong with you\". He never thought it was my BC or recommended i stopped taking it. My last episode I decided to stop using the patch and havent had a seizure since so it definitetly was the problem. I'm just curious about my other options for BC. Why did this happen? What triggered it? How can i be safe from pregnancy and the humiliation? please help!

Also, any of the women who have had epilepsy flare up after coming off the pill, tried hormone creams? or treatments? Has there been any success??? Searching deseprately for relief and answers. Seems my symptoms are getting worse by the day. Is there anyone out there who has had their hormone levels tested after coming OFF the pill?

As some others have said, estrogen can provoke seizure activity, and progesterone can inhibit it, and most BC is estrogen-based. My neuro does research on women and epilepsy and he told me this, and to take depoprovera because it is progestin-based. I never took the others, so I can't tell you any effects of those personally, but on depo I was totally fine. If you want to look at the research, here are a few studies from PubMed: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21134499 read the literature.
