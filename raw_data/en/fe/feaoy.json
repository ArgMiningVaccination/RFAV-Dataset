(hereinafter referred to as \"Shionogi\"), we provide this report to enhance the credibility of Shionogi's report by assessing its business management activities with an emphasis on the environment as described in its Environmental Report 2020. We have conducted a series of activities to investigate the position of Shionogi's environmental activities within its management strategies and how they are planned and executed accordingly; and how performance data, as the result of these activities and the basis of disclosure information, is created, evaluated, and used. Starting with an interview with Dr. Takeshi Shiota (Corporate Officer and the head of Corporate Planning Department, Corporate Strategy Division), we visited the relevant departments within the company to review related documents including the integration report, and to hold discussions with personnel in charge. At the Shionogi CMC Research Innovation Center, we conducted basic verification to confirm that the preparation of the evidence for the disclosed numerical data had been carried out in accordance with the designated systems. Evaluation Opinion For the fiscal year examined, Shionogi decided to disclose its Integrated Report and Environment Report, with the content of the EHS report prepared up to last fiscal year included. As a result, the position of each report has become clearer, with the content of the two reports largely enriched. In \"Shionogi Transformation Strategy 2030 (STS2030)\", the new medium-term management plan announced in June 2020, the items related to contributing to a sustainable society were listed as one of the key issues to focus on, and Shionogi's value creation model was made clearer by specifying the issues in relation to the SDGs items in particular. Embracing \"SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being\" as its main target as a pharmaceutical company, the Shionogi Group's social mission is clearly defined as relieving the threat of infectious diseases, improving social productivity, increasing healthy life expectancy, and contributing to sustainable social security. At present, as COVID-19 is having a major impact on society, these social missions are becoming more important than ever, to which Shionogi can greatly contribute with its main business as a pharmaceutical company and progress is also expected to be made in their core business. Since these are areas highly expected by the society, in the future, Shionogi could demonstrate its achievements in these areas in a more visible manner with the use of indicators so as to visualize its social value creation and further clarify its impact on society. The Shionogi Group defines environmental activities as a material issue (as a result of materiality analysis) that relates to the core of management, along with governance-related and social activities such as human resource development. With resource conservation and circulation as priority issues, Shionogi's environmental activities have been promoted concretely and steadily at a high level, with particular focus on the issues that are highly significant for a pharmaceutical company including AMR control (management of antimicrobial released into the environment, etc.), response to water-related risks and climate change. It is highly commendable that in conjunction with the STS2030, new medium- and long-term environmental targets have been established and executed at high levels, including response to the TCFD recommendations and even incorporating the factor of climate change into AMR control. The Shionogi Group has been promoting environmental conservation activities from early on, with related activities implemented at its respective operating site at high levels. In the future, we expect to see the Shionogi Group's effort expanding fully from within the group to the entire supply chain. The Integrated Report provides abundant information on the Shionogi Group's business prospects and management foundation. The Environment Report provides a clearer picture of how environmental activities are being developed by playing down the issues described in the Integrated Report, as well as their position in the overall picture. It is hoped that further strengthening the linkage between the two reports will make it easier for readers to understand the Shionogi Group, from major matters such as the value creation model to specific activities. <Shionogi CMC Research Innovation Center > The Shionogi Group relinquished its blanket ISO14001 certification obtained in the past. The Shionogi CMC Research Innovation Center is operating at present, with the Environmental Committee and the Health and Safety Committee merged together into the EHS Committee. The Shionogi CMC Research Innovation Center has a long history of operations and has been conducting very high-level environmental activities. For this reason, many of its environmental action targets are set to maintain the same level instead of achieving a higher level. Although it is believed that environmental activities are deeply rooted in the entire center, it would be good to have a mechanism to maintain and improve motivation, such as focusing on activities that contribute to reducing the absolute value of environmental impact even if they are small. We learned that the way people work has changed greatly in the center in response to COVID-19, with many now working remotely. The content of work has changed along with the way people work, which should call for review in many aspects at not only the CMC Innovation Center but also the Shionogi Group as a whole. For this Evaluation Opinion, the survey was conducted remotely in consideration of COVID-19. This experience pointed out that change need to be made to support remote work such as the digitization of documents.
