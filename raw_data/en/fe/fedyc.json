Homeopathy is not only refers to a specific type of therapeutic, but it is also refers to a therapeutic approach. In homeopathy, patients are treated based on what is referred to as the \"Law of Similars\" and follows the principle that \"like cures like\". The provider gathers information from the individual to define a patient's unique constellation of symptoms. This clinical picture is then used to guide the choice of homeopathic medicines that elicit a similar constellation of symptoms. Traditional homeopathic remedies are derived from mineral, chemical, plant, and animal substances, and are prepared via the standards of the U.S. Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia, which has been approved by the FDA. Homeopathy is a gentle medicine that takes the symptomatic complexity of the whole patient into consideration. Homeopathic philosophy asserts that a disease state is borne out of an acquired weakness in the body's inherent defenses or vitality. Therefor, homeopathic medicines are designed to work with the body's physiology so as to restore it to its most vital functional state. What Can I Expect During a Homeopathy Visit? The goal of a homeopathic intake is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the patient's unique experience of their disease state. In order to understand a patient's personal experience, there are a wide variety of questions asked by the clinician ranging from food cravings to weather preferences to childhood illnesses, etc. However, the goal of these questions is, first and foremost, to understand the experience of the individual so that the patient's constellation of symptoms, and therefore the homeopathic treatment, can be best defined.
