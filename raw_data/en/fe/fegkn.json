This course is brought to you by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation (OPCC&CT), which was established in 2011 to lead this significant system wide change of care within the VA health care system. Whole Health is included within VA's strategic goals for 2019 -2024, and Whole Health Systems are now under development in all 18 VISNs, with rapid and successful spread to all VA sites being the ultimate goal. The Whole Health approach for any given Veteran is built around his or her values. What matters most? Why do they want to be healthy in the first place? Focusing on someone's mission, aspiration, and purpose engages them. Teams can empower and equip Veterans with the tools they need to reach their goals. Incorporating the Whole Health framework requires a paradigm shift from problem -based, disease- focused care to Whole Health Care, which is a more expansive and inclusive model. This course is designe d to help you, someone who provides care for Veterans, to take part in that paradigm shift and also assess your own nutrition and self -care. VA defines Whole Health as patient- centered care that affirms the importance of the partnership between the clinic ian and the patient. The focus is on the whole person. It involves co- creating a personalized, proactive, and patient- driven experience. It is informed by evidence and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, health care professionals, and disc iplines to achieve optimal health and well -being. As they move through the Whole Health System, Veterans are encouraged to complete a Personal Health Inventory (PHI), a tool that helps them reflect on their values, priorities, self - care goals, and their vision of what it means to live life fully. It is built upon self -care and empowerment for the individual; it enlists both conventional and complementary approaches as appropriate; and it leverages support systems inside VA and in the community. The PHP foll ows Veterans through the system and, ideally, can draw Whole Health into every aspect of their care. We wish you well as you explore how the Whole Health approach to eating and nutrition can support you in your practice, your broader team, your department, your facility, and even the health care system in general. The intent is that this course can also support you with your own self -care, apply the WH learnings within your own health care role and to connect to this larger Whole Health/EFWH community. Thank you for joining us! EATING FOR WHOLE HEALTH \u2014PARTICIPANT WORKBOOK VHA Office of Patient Centered Care & Cultural Transformation June 4, 2021 9 ABOUT THE COURSE Eating for Whole Health: Nutrition for All Clinicians is an advanced, stand -alone clinical education course designed to introduce VA clinicians to the Whole Health approach as it relates to a fundamental aspect of healing and self -care: nutrition. This four -day virtual course is offered by the VHA Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation (OPCC&CT) and is designed for providers from all different health backgrounds to help them incorporat e nutrition recommendations into Veterans' Personal Health Plans (PHPs). It is informed by the latest research in nutrition and draws from the wisdom of dietitians and functional nutrition practitioners from throughout the VA and beyond. The focus of this course is not to mandate how nutrition guidance is given to Veterans, but rather to offer a learning environment that supports curiosity, exploration, and open discussion of topics that can at times be somewhat complex or controversial. During this course, participants will have an opportunity to explore a number of nutrition- related topics, ranging from how foods affect our bodies at a molecular level to how best to support Veterans in making changes related to their eating patterns. Participants will be introduced to a series of Whole Health tools and techniques, as well as an array of nutrition resources to support their clinical work. Areas of focus will include optimizing nutrition for specific disease states, preventing chronic diseases, collaborating effectively with dietitians and other care team members, and sharing nutrition success stories from throughout the VA. The research that is presented will be supported by a series of patient vignettes focused on how food and drink can influence pain, men tal health, and gastrointestinal function. The latest knowledge on fats, proteins, carbohydrates and various micronutrients will be discussed. Mindful awareness, environmental effects on food, and healthy cooking tips will also be addressed. Participants will take time to assess their own nutrition practices and build on their professional skills with motivational interviewing and personal health planning with food and drink as a specific focus. They will practice with partners and in small groups. This course both provides knowledge and application exercises to assist participants in how to use this information after the course. Participants will leave with new knowledge, tools and research to transform their VA site with the concept that food is medicine. As nutrition is part of many roles in the VA, a diversity of participants including dietitians, providers, and others who either incorporate nutrition recommendations into health plans or provide nutrition referrals to dietit ians comprises this course. Therefore, participants would ideally represent diverse teams and departments either within one given facility or from multiple facilities in order to have a multidisciplinary common approach to nutrition. EATING FOR WHOLE HEALTH \u2014PARTICIPANT WORKBOOK VHA Office of Patient Centered Care & Cultural Transformation June 4, 2021 10 During this course, you are invited to: Learn mo re about the Whole Health approach to food and drink and how this area of self-care interconnects with other aspects of Whole Health Become familiar with the latest research regarding how nutrition can influence both health and healing in the setting of ch ronic diseases Understand how what we eat can affect our bodies' biochemical and genetic functioning Reflect on your own eating patterns, identifying strengths and opportunities to make healthier choices Discuss the benefits and potential limitations of common eating patterns or diets, and learn where to obtain more information about different eating guidelines that are popular with Veterans Learn about and explore local and national resources related to healthy eating Focus on key concepts related to food choices, recognizing how culture and socioeconomic constraints influence eating patterns Witness how effective cooking demonstrations can be in improving Veteran approaches to food and drink Network with other participants locally and nationally to share strong practices and tools to enhance your practice COURSE LEARNING OBJECTIVES Understand key concepts of the Whole Health approach to nutr ition Describe key aspects of functional nutrition and how they can fit into your practice Outline how nutrition can have health -promoting as well as therapeutic effects, particularly for mental health, gastrointestinal health, pain, and prevention of chro nic disease Recognize physical signs and symptoms related to nutritional imbalances Identify what the latest research suggests regarding the health effects of popular herbs and spices List at least five key nutrition resources offered within the VA Create Personal Health Plans that address nutrition More effectively partner with patients to help them make healthy dietary choices EATING FOR WHOLE HEALTH \u2014PARTICIPANT WORKBOOK VHA Office of Patient Centered Care & Cultural Transformation June 4, 2021 11 SECTION 1: ACTIVITIES SESSION I MODULE 1 . INTRODUCTION TO THE COURSE: SETTING THE STAGE BREAKOUT ROOM: INTRODUCTIONS Your name ? Where you are from? Your VA role? Name one food you love and one food you despise! MODULE 2. MAKING THE CASE: THE POWER OF FOOD & DRINK BREAKOUT ROOM: MOST MEMORABLE MEAL EVER! Each person takes a few minutes. Choose someone to go first. Remind everyone of your name Describe your MOST memorable meal ever What made it great? Looking at the Circle, what other areas of the circle were part of the experience? PRACTICAL EXERCISE Most of us do not really consider the nutritive power of food and drink in our daily lives. We also may not regularly put a lot of intention into eating. When was the last time you consumed a meal with the intention of improving your health? What might you do differently to recognize the power of food and drink before WORKBOOK VHA Office of Patient Centered Care & Cultural Transformation June 4, 2021 12 MODULE 3. FOOD AND THE GUT PRACTICAL EXERCISE - CONCEPTION VESSEL 17 (CV 17) Location: the center of the sternum in a shallow hollow. It is at the level of the fourth intercostal space, which is located by counting down four rib spaces from the underside of the clavicle/collar bone, or four fingerbreadths above the base of the breastbone. \"Center of Chest\" or \"Sea of Tranquility\" Holding CV 17 relieves nervousness, emotional uptightness, and anxiety that can lead to insomnia The point can be held with gentle, direct finger pressure, or more gently still by placing the palm on or over the point. MODULE 4. MINDFUL EATING MINDFUL EATING: MINDFUL AWARENESS AND FOOD PRACTICAL EXERCISE Over your next meal, take some time to be mindful of what you are eating. Consider what it took to bring this food to you. Who was involved in the growing process and production? Consider the sun and soil involved in growing the ingredients and ask yourself where in the world the foods came from and how did they get to you. Appreciate all of what it took to bring your food to your plate. As you eat, notice the smells, tastes and textures of your food. Pay attention to any physical, emotional or mental responses you have to eating this meal. What did you notice about mindful eating during your meal that you would like to remember? _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ WORKBOOK VHA Office of Patient Centered Care & Cultural Transformation June 4, 2021 13 SESSION I I MODULE 5. NUTRITION AND PAIN BREAKOUT ROOM: CASE STUDY - ANNA Anna is a 47 year old Army Gulf War Veteran. She has Osteoarthritis in her knees and hands.

In addition to being packed with fiber and protein, black beans are super high in flavonoids, just like blueberries, cranberries and red wine. So, you're getting your fill of antioxidants. And of course, the sweet potatoes have similar antioxidant benefits, along with beta- carotene and vitamin C. And most importantly, the beans and sweet potatoes taste terrific together. Especially when combined with a zesty lime- basil dressing. Black Bean and Sweet Potato Salad - Serves 4 1 very large sweet potato, peeled and cubed (about 3 cups) 2 teaspoons olive oil 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed (I recommend Eden brand to avoid BPA ) 4-5 scallions, sliced 1/2 large red bell pepper, diced Juice and zest of 1 lime 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard (use gluten- free mustard if you are gluten- sensitive) 1/4 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil (or substitute cilantro) 1 tablespoon chopped flat -leaf parsley Salt and f reshly ground black pepper 1. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. 2. Toss the sweet potatoes with 2 teaspoons oil and season with salt and pepper. Spread on a large baking sheet and roast for 20 -30 minutes, turning once halfway through, until potatoes are tender. Put the roasted potatoes in a large bowl with the black beans, scallions and red pepper. 3. In a separate bowl, mix the lime juice, zest, mustard and herbs. Gradually whisk in the olive oil. Add this dressing to the bean- potato mixture and gently mix. Season with salt, pepper and additional lime juice to taste. Adaptations: Cook \u00bd cup quinoa in 1 cup of water and add it to the salad ingredients above. Make 1.5 X the dressing that is called for.

All areas are important and connected. The body and mind have strong healing abilities. Improving one area can help other areas. The inner ring represents your mission, aspirations, or purpose. Your care focuses on you as a unique person. Mindful awareness is being tuned in and present. Your self-care and everyday choices make up the green circle. The next ring is professional care (tests, medications, supplements, surgeries, examinations, treatments, and counseling). This section includes complementary approaches like acupuncture and yoga. The outer ring includes the people and groups who make up your community. Rate where you feel you are on the scales below from 1-5, with 1 being miserable and 5 being great. 1 Miserable 2 Physical Well -Being 3 4 5 Great 1 Miserable 2 Mental/Emotional Well -Being 3 4 5 Great 1 Miserable 2 Life: How is it to live your day-to-d 3 day life? 4 5 Great What is your mission, aspiration, or purpose? What do you live for? What matters most to you? Write a few words to capture your thoughts: My family and playing music. I want to put past experiences in their right place, so I can move on and live a more happy and peaceful life. EATING FOR WHOLE HEALTH \u2014PARTICIPANT WORKBOOK VHA Office of Patient Centered Care & Cultural Transformation June 4, 2021 30 Where You Are and Where You Would Like to Be For each area below, consider \"Where you are\" and \"Where you want to be\". Write in a number between 1 (low) and 5 (high) that best represents where you are and where you want to be. You do not need to be a \"5\" in any of the areas now, nor even wish to be a \"5\" in the future. Area of Self Care Where I am Now (1-5) Where I Want to Be (1 -5) Moving the Body: Our physical, mental, and emotional health are impacted by the amount and kind of movement we do. Moving the body can take many forms such as dancing, walking, gardening, yoga, and exercise. 1 3 Recharge: Our bodies and minds must rest and recharge in order to optimize our health. Getting a good night's rest as well as recharging our mental and physical energy throughout the day are vital to well -being. Taking short breaks or doing something you enjoy or feels good for moments throughout the day are examples of ways to refresh. 4 5 Food and Drink: What we eat and drink can have a huge effect on how we experience life, both physically and mentally. Energy, mood, weight, how long we live, and overall health are all impacted by what and how we choose to eat and drink. 3 5 Personal Development: Our health is impacted by how we choose to spend our time. Aligning our work and personal activities with what really matters to us, or what brings us joy, can have a big effect on our health and outlook on life. 3 5 Family, Friends, and Co -Workers: Our relationships, including those with pets, have as significant an effect on our physical and emotional health as any other factor associated with well-being. Spending more time in relationships that 'fuel' us and less in relationships that 'drain' us is one potential option. Improving our relationship skills or creating new relationships through community activities are other options to consider. 3 5 Spirit and Soul: Connecting with something greater than ourselves may provide a sense of meaning and purpose, peace, or comfort. Connecting and aligning spiritually is very individual and may take the form of religious affiliation, connection to nature, or engaging in things like music or art. 4 4 Surroundings: Our surroundings, both at work and where we live, indoors and out, can affect our health and outlook on life. Changes within our control such as organizing, decluttering, adding a plant or artwork can improve mood and health. 4 4 Power of the Mind: Our thoughts are powerful and can affect our physical, mental, and emotional health. Changing our mindset can aid in healing and coping. Breathing techniques, guided imagery, Tai Chi, yoga, or gratitude can buffer the impact of stress and other emotions. 4 5 Professional Care: \"Prevention and Clinical Care\" Staying up to date on prevention and understanding your health concerns, care options, treatment plan, and their role in your health. n/a n/a Reflections : Now that you have thought about what matters to you in all of these areas, what is your vision of your best possible self? What would your life look like? What kind of activities would you be doing? play music, reduce pain, lose weight, healthy diet Are there any areas you would like to work on? Where might you start?

They work aside the patient to assess and understand the most important and urgent nu trition concerns. They provide relevant education ranging from initial survival instruction to comprehensive education and use counseling skills to deliver supportive goal -oriented care. We encourage you to know the registered dietitians at your facility and offer nutrition services to V eterans. This document describes the four -step process registered dietitians use to create nutrition care plans, providing an overview of what they can offer V eterans. This process is known as Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT); using MNT, dietitians diagnose nutritio n problems and develop a treatment plan for their patients. Step 1: Comprehensive Nutrition Assessment A systematic method of obtaining, verifying, and interpreting data needed to identify nutrition- related problems, causes, and their significance. The as sessment is an ongoing, dynamic process. Lifestyle goals most important to the veteran Readiness to change Food and beverage habits Eating style and eating environment Risk or presence of food insecurity Nutritional inadequacies and deficiencies Nutrition- related physical characteristics via a nutrition focused physical exam Anthropometrics Clinical lab data Dietary supplements Drug and nutrient interactions and depletions Adverse food reactions Other lifestyle factors: stress, movement, purpose, substance use, sleep Step 2: Nutrition Diagnosis The nutrition diagnosis is selected based on the nutrition assessment and most important or urgent problem identified to treat. Step 3: Nutrition Interventions Nutrition interventions are specific actions used to rectify the cause of the nutrition problem identified in the diagnosis. Food and Nutrient Interventions may include recommendations on: Dietary patterns like the Mediterranean, Anti- inflammatory, MIND, or low FODMAP diet Foods to ADD to provide key vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients Foods to REMOVE to decrease inflammation, address adverse food reactions, and support system balances Dietary supplements EATING FOR WHOLE HEALTH \u2014PARTICIPANT WORKBOOK VHA Office of Patient Centered Care & Cultural Transformation June 4, 2021 35 Nutrition- related medication interactions Nutrition Education is a formal process to instruct patients on a skill or impart knowledge. Education topics may include: Prescribed dietary patterns and medical nutrition therapy Meal planning Cooking with whole foods Eating and/or cooking on a budget Mindful eating Interpreting nutrition related labs Sometimes this process is a single intervention, but often ongoing education and coaching is used to keep moving the patient forward. Nutrition Counseling is a supportive process, characterized by a collaborative counselor - patient relationship to establish priorities, goals, and action plans that foster responsibility for self-care. Theories such as the Health Belief Model or Stages of Change Model is used to design an intervention along with various strategies including: Motivational interviewing Goal setting Self-monitoring Reflective listening with a focus on clarifying and eliciting patient's thoughts Stimulus control Stress management Relapse prevention Cognitive restructuring Coordination of Care includes facilitating services with other health professionals or agencies that can assist in managing nutrition- related problems. Referrals may include: Referral to RD with different expertise Referral to complementary care: acupuncture, yoga, Tai Chi, mindful awareness, cooking classes Referral or collaboration with other providers Referral to community agencies: YMCA, Food Banks, or Senior Meal programs Interventions also exist designed to improve the nutritional well-being of a population. Step 4: Nutrition Monitoring and Evaluation Monitoring and evaluation determine the amount of progress being made and whether goals/expected outcomes are being met. The dietitian selects the most appropriate nutrition care indicators to monitor progress. This is a brief glimpse of what an RD can do. Talk with RDs in your service area or contact your nutrition leadership, to learn more about the role of RDs in your facility. Source: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
