Holistic medicine is a comprehensive approach to wellness. Holistic care includes the health of the body, mind, and soul, while traditional medicine often focuses on physical health alone. Holistic doctors prioritize prevention and individualized care. They believe avoiding health issues in the first place is more effective than treating conditions after they develop, and they see each patient as an individual with unique health needs. As a holistic practitioner, Dr. Syed aims to improve every aspect of his patients' health. He combines traditional and modern medical treatment with complementary and alternative medicine to give patients personalized care that makes a difference for their health. What does holistic medicine include? Instead of simply treating the symptoms of a health condition, Dr. Syed works to understand the root causes through comprehensive evaluation. By identifying and addressing these elements throughout your body, he's better able to help you achieve true healing. Holistic medicine often includes a combination of lifestyle remedies, alternative therapies, and traditional medical care. Lifestyle changes may include: - Counseling - Diet and nutrition - Exercise - Self-care Common alternative therapies are: - Acupuncture - Chiropractic care - Homeopathy - Massage - Medical marijuana - Naturopathy Depending on your needs, Dr. Syed may also recommend medication, surgery, or other more traditional medical treatments. Can holistic medicine help me? Holistic medicine is a complementary practice for people with a variety of health needs. From managing chronic diseases like diabetes to improving general wellbeing, holistic medicine has benefits for just about everyone. For example, a patient with chronic migraines may only get medication from a traditional provider. However, if they seek care with a holistic provider, their care may include things like dietary evaluation, stress level measurement, sleep assessment, and more to determine any underlying causes of their pain. With holistic medicine, you have the power to take responsibility for your own health and wellness. Dr. Syed works with all types of patients to educate, treat, and support them, so they can enjoy their best health. Holistic medicine puts you at the center of your treatment plan.
