How to get started with your Naturopathic Doctor 1)Schedule a free 15 minute phone consultation with our clinical director, to determine whether we are a good fit for you, and which doctor would be best suited to help you. 2) Briefly tell us about your health concerns and history during your free consult. We need to hear some unique symptoms that you experience when you are at your worst (physical symptoms, things that trigger symptoms, reactions to stressors, etc.) 3) Our doctors will let you know whether our treatment could be the answer and our administrative team will get you scheduled for your new client intake appointments. If we're not the right match, we'll give other suggestions/referrals. What to expect during your new client intake visits Our naturopathic doctors have an expertise in homeopathic & integrative medicine. The homeopathic consult may be scheduled on the same day as your initial naturopathic intake assessment or they can be scheduled on separate days. Both intakes below are scheduled with the naturopathic doctor and payment is due at time of service. View pricing details here. Initial Intake Consultation ($550: $150 deposit + $400 at time of visit): - Discussion of your current concerns, past medical history, family history, and any other health concerns you have - Physical examination as appropriate based on your health history* - Discussion of diagnosis, testing, and treatment options that may be helpful* - In depth review of your primary symptoms, to determine which homeopathic medicine would be best to treat them Stories or examples of the symptoms at their worst Triggers or traumatic events that initiated the symptoms Thought patterns and speech patterns during symptom flares Emotional reactions to stressful events Behavioral changes when symptoms are increased Physical sensations that occur when the symptoms are heightened Discomfort in the body, or pain anywhere in the body (headaches, digestive issues, tension internally or odd sensations in certain body parts) that comes on when symptoms are strongest Things that are soothing or help reduce symptoms Changes in thirst, specific cravings, or appetite alterations when symptoms are increased - We will request of past medical records from other physicians if necessary* - We will discuss option to order new labs if appropriate* - We may recommend vitamins, herbs, or other natural supplements at this time - Discussion of benefits and risks of homeopathic treatment, and explanation of homeopathic protocol We will recommend a homeopathic medicine specific to you, typically costing $10-12 per vial that would usually last over a month. Homeopathic medicines can be mailed to out-of-state patients, and some are sold in stores What about follow-up visits? Follow-up visits are an important part of your care. Your body needs time to heal and naturopathic medicine is not an overnight fix. Most of our clients hold monthly follow-up visits that range from 30-45 minutes. As symptoms lessen and you start to feel better, you may have more time between your follow-up visits or follow-up as needed. During these visits, your doctor will review your symptoms, assess of your response to treatment, and decide if changes are needed. - 15-minute mini follow up can be scheduled if you have been responding well to your protocol ($70) - 30-minute standard follow up ($130) - 45-minute extended follow up if you need significant review of your symptoms and protocol ($200) - 60-minute complex follow up for more in depth analysis and review ($260) (Visit prices are subject to change every 1-2 years.) * For out-of-state clients, our doctors are acting as holistic health consultants only and can't diagnose, order labs, or order prescriptions, and this would need to be done with your psychiatrist, general practitioner, nurse practitioner, etc. Certain states in the US have laws against practice of naturopathic medicine, such as South Carolina and Tennessee. If you live in one of those states, we can't schedule an initial consultation with you. We recommend contacting a local mental health provider in your state, such as a holistic MD or psychiatric nurse practitioner. "}
