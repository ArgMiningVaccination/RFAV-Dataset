Moore; Canadian Paediatric Society [Infectious Diseases and Immunization Committee](/en/documents/authors-auteurs/infectious-diseases-and-immunization-committee) The most substantial effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on children and adolescents have related more to disruptions in educational, physical, and social activities than direct viral effects. Nonetheless, small numbers of cases of severe COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) have caused significant direct morbidity. With the arrival of the more transmissible Delta and recent Omicron variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many more children and adolescents are becoming infected. Consequently, the numbers of children and adolescents with severe disease, although still very low, are increasing. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is available in Canada for children and adolescents aged 5 years and over. The Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) advocates for the vaccination of this population. Information on COVID-19 vaccines for children and adolescents will be updated as new data becomes available. [Addendum on approval of Moderna vaccine for children 6 to 11 years, March 25, 2022](#Addendum). [Addendum on approval of Moderna vaccine for children 6 months to 5 years of age, July 19, 2022.](#July 19 Addendum) Children and adolescents have been relatively spared the direct effects of SARS CoV-2 infection. Their infection rates were low until recently, and most of those infected have no or mild symptoms [ [1](#ref1)]. Nevertheless, some develop severe disease and require hospitalization. In Canada, cumulative data to January 8, 2022 indicated that children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years old accounted for 21% of cases but much lower proportions of hospitalizations (at 2.5%), intensive care unit (ICU) admissions (1.5%), and deaths (0.08%) [ [2](#ref2)]. Because these data include some cases with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized for unrelated reasons, their outcomes were not necessarily the result of COVID-19, and the actual proportions of cases with severe COVID-19 disease are therefore likely to be lower. For Canadian adolescents, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is similar to that in young adults. Adolescents 12 to 19 years of age account for approximately 9% of the Canadian population and 9.1% of cumulative COVID-19 cases reported to January 8, 2022. In contrast, this group accounted for only 1.0% of COVID-19-associated non-ICU hospitalizations, 0.7% of ICU admissions, and 0.03% of cases resulting in death. Since May 2021, coinciding both with decreasing adult hospitalizations after immunization and the increasing prominence of the more transmissible Delta and Omicron variants, the relative burden of disease for adolescents has increased [ [2](#ref2)][ [3](#ref3)]. Emerging data suggest that severe outcomes of COVID-19 are less frequent with the Omicron than with the Delta variant. However, the numbers of adolescents with severe disease is increasing due to rapidly rising numbers of infections in this age group during the current pandemic wave [ [4](#ref4)]. Younger children with SARS-CoV-2 infection generally present with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms or remain asymptomatic. In Canada, severe outcomes such as hospitalization and death are very infrequent, occurring in <0.3% and <0.002% respectively of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in children aged 5 to 11 years old [ [5](#ref5)]. As of January 8, 2022, children in this age group represented 5.8% of cumulative confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, 0.4% of COVID-19-associated non-ICU hospitalizations, 0.3% of COVID-19-associated ICU admissions, and 0.02% of COVID-19 deaths [ [2](#ref2)]. Children are also at risk of developing MIS-C, a serious though uncommon condition associated with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [6](#ref6)]. MIS-C is estimated to affect between 0.5% and 3.1% of all children diagnosed with COVID-19, and between 0.9% and 7.6% of hospitalized paediatric COVID-19 patients [ [5](#ref5)]. In Canada, 269 cases of MIS-C in individuals 0 to 19 years of age had been reported as of October 2, 2021, 36% of whom required ICU admission. Their median age was 6 years, with 58% of cases occurring in children aged 5 years and older. Most MIS-C cases recover fully, and no MIS-C associated deaths have been reported in Canada to date [ [7](#ref7)]. While evidence is limited for paediatric populations, children and adolescents may also be at risk of developing post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (\"long COVID\"). Current evidence suggests that the risk is low in children compared with older age groups [ [5](#ref5)]. Children and adolescents with certain underlying chronic medical conditions are known to be at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease. The Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program reported that as of December 31, 2020, 39% of children and adolescents who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 had at least one underlying comorbidity. Risk factors for more severe disease included obesity, chronic neurological conditions, and chronic lung disease other than asthma [ [1](#ref1)][ [3](#ref3)][ [8](#ref8)]. Another Canadian study assessing risk factors for severe disease in children and adolescents hospitalized for confirmed COVID-19 found in multivariable analysis that having multiple comorbidities, obesity, neurological disorder, and anemia or hemoglobinopathy were independent risk factors for severity [ [9](#ref9)]. Other Canadian surveillance data indicate that the proportion of COVID-19 cases being hospitalized or admitted to an ICU is 4 to 5 times higher for individuals 12 years of age and older with immunodeficiency than for the general population [ [10](#ref10)]. Studies elsewhere have identified asthma, chronic lung disease, type 1 diabetes, congenital cardiac disease, obesity, neurodevelopmental disorders, and some mental health conditions, as risk factors for more severe COVID-19 [ [3](#ref3)][ [11](#ref11)][ [12](#ref12)]. In a study of children admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection, risk factors for severe disease among children aged <2 years were chronic lung disease, neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease, prematurity, and airway abnormality, while for those aged 2 to 17 years, risk factors were feeding tube dependence, diabetes mellitus, and obesity [ [13](#ref13)]. In a systematic review of children and adolescents with severe COVID-19 disease requiring mechanical ventilation, 75% had comorbidities, the most common being chronic cardiac disease, immunosuppression, chronic respiratory disease, and obesity [ [14](#ref14)]. Among children and adolescents admitted with COVID-19 in the US, chronic conditions were more prevalent in Hispanic and Black children than in White children [ [15](#ref15)]. Along with the risks to physical health posed by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the COVID-19 pandemic and the public health response to it have had significant adverse indirect effects. Disruptions in family routines, school and other educational activities, play, and sports, as well as separation from friends, grandparents, and other close family members have affected the mental health and physical well-being of children and adolescents in Canada, with frequency of eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and problematic substance use on the rise [ [3](#ref3)][ [5](#ref5)][ [16](#ref16)]. Furthermore, both the pandemic and the responses to it have exacerbated social inequities for racialized and Indigenous communities, refugees and other newcomers to Canada, persons living in low-income settings, and children or youth with disabilities [ [5](#ref5)][ [17](#ref17)]. Young children also transmit SARS-CoV-2. One Ontario study of transmission in households from June to December 2020 reported that children aged 0 to 3 years had greater odds of transmitting to household contacts than older children [ [18](#ref18)]. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are mRNA vaccines that target the spike proteins on the surface of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA directing production of these spike proteins is produced biochemically using recombinant technology, then enveloped in a protective lipid coat. When the mRNA vaccine is injected, it is taken up by antigen-presenting cells (macrophages and dendritic cells) near the injection site. Inside these cells, the mRNA uses the host cell's ribosomes to produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is then expressed on the surface of the cell, stimulating humoral and cellular immune responses. The SARS-CoV-2 mRNA itself does not replicate in the human cell and is rapidly broken down by cellular enzymes. The SARS-CoV-2 mRNA does not enter the cell nucleus, nor does it affect host DNA or RNA [ [19](#ref19)]. Using SARS-CoV-2 mRNA technology rather than the more conventional whole virus or virus protein subunits to produce a vaccine permitted rapid vaccine development and scale-up of production [ [20](#ref20)]. This is the first instance of widespread clinical use of an mRNA vaccine, but the technology has been in development for several years. Clinical trials of mRNA vaccines are in early stages for other infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, cytomegalovirus, and Zika virus, and as therapeutic vaccines for certain types of cancer [ [19](#ref19)][ [21](#ref21)]. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) for adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older was authorized for use in Canada on December 9, 2020. Authorization of other COVID-19 vaccines for adults followed. On May 5, 2021, Health Canada extended their authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to children aged 12 to 15 years, and on August 27, 2021, authorization for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Spikevax) was extended to adolescents aged 12 to 17 years [ [22](#ref22)]. On November 19, 2021, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was authorized for children 5 to 11 years of age [ [5](#ref5)]. Application for authorization of the Moderna vaccine for children 6 to 11 years of age has been submitted to Health Canada. Studies of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines in children aged 6 months to 5 or 6 years are underway [ [23](#ref23)][ [24](#ref24)], and studies of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents are also in progress [ [25](#ref25)]. Viral vector vaccines (AstraZeneca and Janssen) are authorized in Canada for adults 18 years of age and older but mRNA vaccines are preferred. Viral vector vaccines are not authorized for children or adolescents in Canada [ [22](#ref22)]. As of January 8, 2022, 83% of Canadian adolescents aged 12 to 17 had received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine while 48% of children aged 5 to 11 years had received their first dose [ [26](#ref26)]. The efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been reported in large studies of individuals aged 16 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or 18 (Moderna) years and older. Efficacy was 94% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease, starting at one or two weeks after receiving the second dose [ [22](#ref22)]. In subsequent smaller studies, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was evaluated in 2260 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age, and the Moderna vaccine in 3732 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against symptomatic COVID-19 disease in adolescents from 7 days after dose 2 was 100% (18 cases in the placebo group, 0 cases in the vaccine group). For the Moderna vaccine, efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 disease starting 14 days after dose 2 was also 100% (4 cases in the placebo group, 0 cases in the vaccine group). There were no cases of severe COVID-19 or deaths in either study. Neutralizing antibody levels following the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were higher in adolescents than in the 16- to 25-year-old group, and with the Moderna vaccine were similar to those in the 18- to 25-year-old group [ [3](#ref3)]. In the clinical trial of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 5 to 11 years old, 1518 children who received the vaccine and 750 who received placebo have been followed for a minimum of 2 months. A further cohort of 1591 children who received the vaccine have been followed for adverse effects for a median of 2.4 weeks. Interim analysis indicated that the estimated efficacy of the vaccine against symptomatic COVID-19 from 7 days after dose 2 was 90.7% (95% CI: 67.7 to 98.3%; 3 cases in the vaccine group and 16 cases in the placebo group). There were no cases of severe COVID-19. Immunogenicity was similar to that reported in studies of this vaccine in adolescents and young adults [ [5](#ref5)]. Vaccine effectiveness against emerging variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is an issue of concern. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines produced very good protection against infection with the Delta variant after the second dose and protection against hospitalization after the first dose [ [22](#ref22)]. The more transmissible Omicron variant now accounts for most newly reported cases in Canada [ [28](#ref28)]. Vaccine effectiveness against Omicron infection and symptomatic disease after an mRNA primary series is low, but increases after a booster dose. Data from the UK indicate that effectiveness against hospitalization is 88% two or more weeks after the booster dose [ [29](#ref29)]. Paediatric data on vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron variant are not yet available but two doses may be enough to prevent hospitalization of young children, given their more robust immune response. Information on the efficacy and effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against asymptomatic infection and transmission is evolving. Results have demonstrated moderate to high effectiveness after the first dose and high effectiveness after the second dose for previous variants of concern [ [22](#ref22)] but waning immunity is of concern [ [30](#ref30)][ [31](#ref31)]. Preliminary data suggest that effectiveness of two doses of vaccine against transmission of the Omicron variant is very low or nonexistent [ [32](#ref32)]. Clinical trial reports have indicated that mild to moderate adverse effects that resolve rapidly are common with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was well tolerated in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age, with reactogenicity similar to that reported in individuals aged 16 to 25 years. Local reactions were mostly of mild to moderate severity and occurred more frequently following the first dose. Systemic events were predominantly fatigue, headache, chills, muscle pain, fever, and joint pain (in order of descending frequency) and occurred more often after the second dose. Compared with individuals 18 to 55 years of age, adolescents 12 to 15 years old experienced headache, chills, and fever more frequently. Following the second dose, up to 65% of adolescents had headaches, up to 42% had chills, and up to 20% had fever. Vaccination-related lymphadenopathy occurred in 0.6% of vaccine recipients. There were no serious adverse events related to the vaccine and no deaths were reported [ [3](#ref3)]. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was also well tolerated in adolescents. Local reactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity, occurred with similar frequency after the first and second doses, and were more frequent in adolescents compared with adults. Axillary swelling or tenderness occurred in 23.3% of adolescents after dose 1 and in 21.0% after dose 2. Systemic events were predominantly fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, nausea or vomiting, and fever (in order of descending frequency) and occurred more frequently after the second dose [ [3](#ref3)]. Following the second dose, 70% of adolescents had headache, 68% had fatigue, 47% had myalgia, and 43% had chills. Systemic reactogenicity was similar to that observed in young adults [ [33](#ref33)]. There were no serious adverse events related to the vaccine, and no deaths [ [3](#ref3)]. In the clinical trial of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children 5 to 11 years old, local reactions were very common, mostly of mild to moderate severity, and more frequent than in the older children. Systemic events occurred more frequently after the second dose and were predominantly fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, chills, fever, and joint pain (in order of decreasing frequency). Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. Systemic events were less frequent than observed for adolescents and young adults. There were no cases of myocarditis or pericarditis or any other serious adverse event [ [5](#ref5)]. These studies are ongoing, and the children and adolescents involved will be followed for 2 years after their second dose of vaccine [ [3](#ref3)][ [5](#ref5)]. Post-marketing reports of myocarditis and pericarditis: The probability of detection of rare adverse events in clinical trials is low even in very large clinical trials. Therefore, ongoing pharmacovigilance is essential. Intensive post-marketing surveillance for adverse effects is ongoing in Canada and elsewhere. Since late April 2021, very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis after receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been reported in Canada and internationally [ [3](#ref3)][ [22](#ref22)]. Detection of this potential safety signal indicates that surveillance strategies for rare adverse events following immunization are working [ [34](#ref34)]. Cases occurred most often in individuals aged 12 to 30 years, more frequently in males compared with females, more frequently after the second dose, and usually within the week following vaccination. Most cases have been mild, with patients responding well to conservative treatment and recovering quickly [ [3](#ref3)]. Higher rates have been observed after Moderna vaccine than after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. In Canada, as of November 12, 2021, the overall reported rate of myocarditis/pericarditis was 3.0 per 100,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine compared with 1.9 per 100,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The rates of myocarditis/pericarditis in the group at highest risk\u2014males 18 to 29 years old after their second vaccine dose\u2014were 15.9 per 100,000 for Moderna and 2.6 per 100,000 for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine [ [35](#ref35)]. Data from the US further suggest that risk for myocarditis/pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination may be higher in adolescents aged 16 to 17 years than in younger adolescents, aged 12 to 15 years [ [5](#ref5)]. Data on the risk for myocarditis/pericarditis in children 5 to 11 years old following immunization with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were limited at time of writing. In the US, myocarditis among children aged 5 to 11 years appears to be rare, with 12 verified reports after administration of over eight million vaccine doses. The rates after the second dose were 4.3 and 2.0 per million doses in boys and girls respectively [ [36](#ref36)][ [37](#ref37)]. In general, the occurrence of myocarditis unrelated to COVID-19 vaccine is less common in children this age than in older adolescents and young adults [ [5](#ref5)]. For adolescents and adults 12 to 29 years of age, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is now preferred to the Moderna vaccine because of the lower reported rate of myocarditis/pericarditis following receipt of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, compared with Moderna. Some moderately to severely immunocompromised adolescents may benefit from the slightly higher antibody levels generated by the Moderna vaccine, however. Administration of Moderna vaccine may be considered, based on clinical judgement [ [35](#ref35)]. Emerging Canadian safety surveillance data suggest that a longer interval between the first and second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may reduce risk for myocarditis/pericarditis. The second dose should be administered 8 weeks after the first dose, and not earlier [ [35](#ref35)]. The known risks of COVID-19 illness for Canadian children and adolescents 12 years of age and older (including hospitalization and complications such as MIS-C and myocarditis) outweigh the rare risk of myocarditis or pericarditis following vaccination, which may require hospitalization in some cases but are relatively mild and resolve quickly in most individuals [ [3](#ref3)][ [22](#ref22)]. A recent US study found myocarditis rates with confirmed COVID-19 infection to be as high as 450 cases per million infections in young males aged 12 to 17 years [ [3](#ref3)]. Similar risk-benefit analysis has not performed for Canadian children 5 to 11 years old, but data from the US support vaccination for this age group [ [38](#ref38)]. There have been reports of myocarditis following an mRNA booster dose. Emerging data suggest the rate of myocarditis in adults following a booster dose may fall between the rates observed after dose 1 and after dose 2, with one report of a higher rate after the booster dose. Data specific to adolescents are pending [ [4](#ref4)]. Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends that anyone receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine should be informed of the risk of myocarditis or pericarditis, and advised to seek medical attention if they develop acute chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations [ [3](#ref3)]. Health care providers (HCPs) should consider the diagnosis of myocarditis and pericarditis in adolescents with any of these symptoms, and ask about prior COVID-19 vaccination when they are encountered. Initial investigations include electrocardiogram (ECG), serum troponins, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. If the ECG is abnormal or troponin levels are elevated, or if clinical suspicion of myocarditis/pericarditis is high, an echocardiogram and urgent cardiology consultation should be obtained. Other potential causes of myocarditis or pericarditis, including acute COVID-19 infection, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and other infectious or non-infectious etiologies, should be investigated [ [3](#ref3)][ [39](#ref39)]. All cases of myocarditis and pericarditis post-COVID-19 vaccination should be reported promptly to local public health authorities [ [22](#ref22)]. Children and adolescents who have had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should receive COVID-19 vaccine because re-infections occur [ [40](#ref40)]. There is some evidence that immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection may wane more slowly than immunity after vaccination [ [41](#ref41)]. However, the degree and duration of protection after SARS-CoV-2 infection is variable and may be affected by the severity of the infection, age, presence of comorbidities, and differences in SARS-CoV-2 variants. Infection with the Delta variant does not appear to provide significant protection against infection with the Omicron variant. Due to widespread circulation of the Omicron variant, many children and adolescents seeking COVID-19 vaccination will have a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [40](#ref40)]. At present, two doses of vaccine are suggested due to the absence of data on the effectiveness of one dose in previously infected individuals, especially regarding reinfection with newer variants. While adverse events following vaccination were slightly more frequent than in persons without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the frequency of severe adverse events did not increase [ [22](#ref22)]. Emerging evidence indicates that a delay between SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination is associated with improved antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccines. NACI suggests the following intervals between previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination: [ [40](#ref40)] In cases of infection with no previous vaccine dose or between first and second doses: Give dose 8 weeks after symptom onset, or after positive COVID-19 test if asymptomatic. In moderately to severely immunocompromised individuals: Give second or third dose of primary series 4 to 8 weeks after onset of symptoms, or after positive COVID-19 test if asymptomatic. In cases of infection after primary series but before booster: Give booster 3 months after onset of symptoms, or after positive COVID-19 test if asymptomatic, or 6 months after completion of primary series, whichever is longer. For individuals with previous history of MIS-C: Give dose when clinical recovery from MIS-C is complete or at least 90 days since the onset of MIS-C, whichever is longer. If considering administration of vaccine at shorter intervals after infection than suggested above, the potential for a less robust immune response with a shorter interval, as well as risk factors for exposure during the suggested interval and for severe disease if exposure occurs, should be taken into account. At a minimum, symptoms of acute COVID-19 should have resolved and isolation or quarantine be no longer required. This guidance may change as more information becomes available. Immunocompromised individuals are at higher risk for prolonged infection and serious complications from COVID-19. However, COVID-19 vaccine immunogenicity and effectiveness are also lower in immunocompromised adults compared with the general population. Some individuals with moderate to severe immunocompromise who had a reduced (or no) antibody response after two doses of an mRNA vaccine showed an increased antibody response after a third dose. Reactogenicity after the third dose was similar to that after previous doses. No serious adverse events were associated with receipt of a third dose, but the numbers of individuals studied to date have been insufficient to provide information regarding the potential risk of rare adverse events. Although there are no data specific to immunocompromised children and adolescents, the findings in adults can be extrapolated to this age group [ [10](#ref10)]. NACI recommends that moderately to severely immunocompromised individuals should be immunized with a primary series of three doses of an mRNA vaccine. Conditions warranting a third dose are defined as: [ [8](#ref8)][ [10](#ref10)] The recommended interval between doses is 4 to 8 weeks. An interval longer than 4 weeks is likely to result in a better immune response and longer duration of protection, but would increase the period of time during which an immunocompromised individual may be suboptimally protected. If a longer interval is being considered, risk factors for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during this period (including local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and circulating variants of concern) and the individual's risk for severe disease should be taken into account [ [8](#ref8)][ [10](#ref10)]. In general, NACI recommends that immunocompromised individuals be immunized when maximum immune response can be anticipated: completing the first two doses at least 2 weeks before any planned immunosuppression, if possible; delaying immunization if the deficiency is transient and if exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely during this delay; and stopping or reducing immunosuppression to permit better vaccine response, if medically appropriate [ [10](#ref10)][ [22](#ref22)]. For detailed information on conditions and therapies associated with immunodeficiency and the timing of vaccination in relation to immunosuppressive therapy, consult the chapter on [Immunization of immunocompromised persons](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-3-vaccination-specific-populations/page-8-immunization-immunocompromised-persons.html) in the Canadian Immunization Guide [ [42](#ref42)]. The effectiveness of an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine in immunocompromised individuals is still unknown. Informed consent for immunosuppressed individuals should include discussion regarding the possibility of diminished immune response, even after a third dose. Immunocompromised individuals should continue to follow recommended public health measures for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is important for household members, those providing health care, and other close contacts of an immunocompromised person to be fully vaccinated [ [10](#ref10)]. Pregnant women are at risk for more severe COVID-19, with higher rates of hospitalization and ICU admission compared with non-pregnant women. COVID-19 is also a risk factor for poorer pregnancy outcomes. Data from over 35,000 pregnant women who received COVID-19 vaccine in the US, and additional reports from international immunization registries, have not detected any maternal or neonatal safety concerns associated with receiving COVID vaccines. Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination during pregnancy leads to antibody levels comparable to those generated in non-pregnant women [ [22](#ref22)]. In one study, COVID-19 vaccine mRNA was not found in breast milk 4 h to 48 h after vaccination. No safety concerns have been detected with mRNA vaccination of breastfeeding women. Breastfeeding should continue after vaccination. Observational studies have shown that both anti-spike IgG and IgA are present in breast milk for at least for 6 weeks following maternal vaccination with mRNA vaccines [ [22](#ref22)]. Antibody passively transferred to the fetus or infant during pregnancy or breastfeeding could, potentially, protect the infant from COVID-19 [ [22](#ref22)]. Vaccine recipients and HCPs are encouraged to enroll patients who have received a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy in COVID-19 vaccine pregnancy registries [ [22](#ref22)]. Rare anaphylactic reactions have been reported following immunization with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The incidence is estimated to be between 2.0 to 7.9 cases per million doses of vaccine administered [ [22](#ref22)]. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines should not be offered routinely to individuals who have had a suspected anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or to any of its components until they have been assessed by an allergist. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of the vaccines, has rarely been associated with anaphylactic reactions. PEG is also present in some medications including cough syrups, laxatives, products used for bowel preparation for colonoscopy, ultrasound gel, contact lens care solutions, and some cosmetics [ [22](#ref22)]. The Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine formulation used for children 5 to 11 years old also contain a buffer, tromethamine (also known as 'trometamol' or 'tris'), that has been used for many years in some other routine childhood vaccines as well as in other injectable medications, without safety concerns. Allergy to tromethamine has been reported but is extremely rare [ [4](#ref4)]. Referral to an allergist or special immunization clinic is recommended for individuals with any severe allergic reaction to the vaccine or its components. The vaccine vial stoppers do not contain latex [ [43](#ref43)][ [44](#ref44)]. For individuals who have confirmed myocarditis within 6 weeks following vaccination with a dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, a further dose should be deferred until more information becomes available. This precaution also applies to anyone with pericarditis who has had an abnormal cardiac investigation (ECG, elevated troponins, echocardiogram, or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging). Individuals whose history is compatible with pericarditis but who either did not have a cardiac workup or whose cardiac investigations were normal, can be revaccinated when they are symptom-free and at least 90 days has passed since vaccination [ [45](#ref45)]. Some people with confirmed myocarditis and/or pericarditis may choose to receive another dose of vaccine after discussing risks and benefits with their HCP. In such cases, they should be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Informed consent should include discussion regarding risk for recurrence of myocarditis or pericarditis following re-vaccination, which is not yet known, and the need to seek immediate medical assessment if symptoms occur [ [45](#ref45)]. Individuals with a history of myocarditis unrelated to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination should consult their physicians for advice about receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. If the myocarditis diagnosis is remote and they are no longer followed clinically for cardiac issues, they should receive the vaccine [ [3](#ref3)]. It is not yet known whether individuals who have had MIS-C are at risk for recurrence following vaccination or following reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. These theoretical concerns should be weighed against the known risks of reinfection, taking into account risk factors for exposure and for having severe COVID-19 if reinfection occurs. NACI recommends that for children with a previous history of MIS-C, vaccination should be postponed until clinical recovery is complete or 90 days post-diagnosis, whichever is longer [ [5](#ref5)]. The vaccination of children and adolescents with an acute illness should be deferred until acute symptoms have resolved, to prevent confounding symptoms of their illness with adverse effects from the vaccine [ [22](#ref22)]. Individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 should undergo SARS-CoV-2 testing and should not attend an immunization clinic until they no longer require isolation or quarantine [ [22](#ref22)]. For individuals 12 years of age and older, NACI recommends that COVID-19 vaccines may be given simultaneously with, or at any time before or after, any other vaccines including influenza vaccines [ [22](#ref22)]. For children 5 to 11 years of age, NACI states that thorough post-marketing safety surveillance will be required to detect adverse events following immunization that may occur in this age group. It would be prudent to wait for a period of at least 14 days before or after the administration of another vaccine before administrating a COVID-19 vaccine. This suggested waiting period between vaccines is precautionary, and feasibility may be challenging for both HCPs and parents. Concomitant administration or a shorter interval between vaccines may be warranted on an individual basis in some circumstances at the clinical discretion of the HCP [ [5](#ref5)]. The CPS recommends that COVID-19 vaccine be offered to children 5 to 11 years of age at the same time as other required vaccines UNLESS there is assurance that timely administration of the other vaccines will not be compromised. Many children and adolescents are behind with their routine vaccines or boosters because of the pandemic, and co-administration can help bring vaccination status up to date. Prophylactic oral analgesics or antipyretics, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, should not be routinely used before or at the time of vaccination due to a theoretical concern regarding their interference with immune response. However, use of these medications before or during vaccination is not a contraindication to receiving the vaccine. Oral analgesics or antipyretics may be considered to manage pain or fever after vaccination [ [22](#ref22)]. There is a theoretical risk that mRNA vaccines may temporarily affect cell-mediated immunity, resulting in false-negative tuberculin skin tests or interferon gamma release assays. When these tests are required, they should be completed and skin tests read before an mRNA vaccine is administered, or delayed for at least 4 weeks after vaccination. If these tests cannot be delayed, it may be prudent to re-test individuals with negative results at least 4 weeks after immunization [ [22](#ref22)]. COVID-19 vaccines should not be administered simultaneously with SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies. There is insufficient evidence regarding the effects of such products on immune response to COVID-19 vaccine. Optimal timing of administration and potential interference between products are currently unknown, and expert clinical opinion should be sought on a case-by-case basis [ [22](#ref22)]. The potential for interference between other monoclonal antibodies and COVID-19 vaccine is also not known, and expert clinical opinion should be sought on a case-by-case basis [ [22](#ref22)]. NACI does not address the use of other blood products. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that COVID-19 vaccines may be administered with intravenous immunoglobulin or other antibody therapies not specific to SARS-CoV-2, simultaneously or without regard to the interval between injections [ [46](#ref46)]. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine: For children and adolescents 12 years of age and older, each dose is 0.3 mL and contains 30 mcg of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mRNA. For those 5 to 11 years old, each dose is 0.2 mL and contains 10 mcg of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mRNA [ [5](#ref5)]. Children who receive the 10 mcg Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for their first dose and turn 12 years old before their second dose may receive the 30 mcg per dose Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. However, if the second dose of 10 mcg is given instead, the dose is considered sufficient [ [5](#ref5)]. Moderna vaccine: For children and adolescents 12 years of age and older. Each dose is 0.5 mL and contains 100 mcg of the spike protein mRNA [ [22](#ref22)]. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are given by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle, or if this is not possible, the anterolateral thigh. Although the two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were given 21 days and 28 days apart, respectively, in the clinical trials, NACI now recommends an interval of 8 weeks between doses [ [35](#ref35)]. As a general principle, extending the interval between doses of a vaccine improves both the response to the second dose and duration of immunity. When COVID-19 vaccine supplies were limited, NACI recommended a maximum interval of 4 months between doses to allow more people to be vaccinated with their first dose more quickly. Since then, post-marketing studies have indicated that extending the interval between doses results in increased effectiveness. The data further suggest that a longer interval between doses may be associated with reduced risk for developing myocarditis/pericarditis [ [35](#ref35)]. Given the current, rapidly progressing wave of COVID-19 associated with the Omicron variant and the recent roll-out of COVID-19 vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old, there is some pressure to shorten the interval between vaccine doses. Those who choose to shorten the interval must weigh the short-term advantage of achieving protection more rapidly against the possible long-term disadvantages (suggested by data from older age groups) of lower immune responses, shorter durations of protection, and possibly higher risk of vaccine-associated myocarditis. Immunity wanes over time and is also influenced by evolving variants. In Canada, booster doses have been recommended for high-risk adults and may be offered to other adults [ [47](#ref47)]. NACI now recommends that a booster dose may be offered to adolescents 12 to 17 years of age who may be a higher risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 infection, including those who: Medical conditions defined as high risk are: cancer on active treatment; chronic kidney disease; chronic lung diseases, including uncontrolled asthma; cystic fibrosis; neurodevelopmental and other chronic neurological conditions, including epilepsy and cerebrovascular disease; type 1 or type 2 diabetes; Down syndrome; congenital heart disease or other chronic heart diseases, including pulmonary hypertension; chronic liver disease; obesity (BMI 30); pregnancy; sickle cell disease or thalassemia; substance use disorders; immunocompromised state, including primary immune deficiency, solid organ or haematopoietic stem cell transplant, HIV infection, or immunosuppressive therapy; medically fragile or having medically complex needs [ [4](#ref4)]. The booster dose should be given at least 6 months after completion of the two- or three-dose primary series. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is preferred [ [4](#ref4)]. Booster doses were recently recommended for all individuals 12 years of age and over in the US. [ [46](#ref46)]. The overall benefit of a booster dose for the general adolescent population remains unclear, and no recommendations for booster doses for this population are being made by NACI at this time [ [4](#ref4)]. Immunization can be stressful for children and adolescents, and may trigger immunization stress-related responses such as fainting, tachycardia, difficulty breathing, hyperventilation, functional neurological symptoms, fatigue, and nausea. Symptoms may resemble anaphylaxis [ [48](#ref48)]. Evidence-based strategies to mitigate pain and stress, such as the CARD system, may be helpful in controlling stress [ [49](#ref49)][ [50](#ref50)]. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has been highly publicized, with most concern focused on the speed with which vaccines were developed. However, a survey in March 2021 revealed that 77% of Canadians were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine [ [51](#ref51)], and a survey of Canadian parents from December 2020 found that 63% intended to vaccinate their children [ [52](#ref52)]. Hundreds of millions of doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered worldwide to date have demonstrated a favourable safety profile. Parents, adolescents, and children should be reassured that despite this vaccine's rapid development, clinical trials and regulatory review have met accepted standards for these processes, and extensive post-marketing surveillance for adverse events is ongoing. Parents and adolescents receiving their first dose may be interested in participating in the Canadian National Vaccine Safety Network, which monitors vaccine safety following COVID-19 vaccination in some provinces and territories [ [53](#ref53)]. The CPS online module \" [Our best shot at COVID: Overcoming vaccine hesitancy in 2021](https://pedagogy.cps.ca/#/course-bundles/fa04fc8b-475f-49fb-9a5f-53a147e37050)\" provides strategies for dealing with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in practice settings [ [54](#ref54)]. On March 17, 2022, Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Spikevax) was authorized for use in children 6 to 11 years of age in Canada. The dose is 50 mcg (0.25 mL). The [National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI)](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/recommendations-use-moderna-spikevax-covid-19-vaccine-children-6-11-years-age.html) states that while the Moderna vaccine may be offered as an alternative to the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty vaccine, the use of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is preferred. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is preferred to the Moderna vaccine in older children and young adults because of higher rates of myocarditis with Moderna vaccine, as discussed above. The risk of myocarditis in children 6 to 11 years of age is unknown but expected to be very rare. Data from adult populations suggest that the Moderna vaccine may result in higher vaccine effectiveness compared to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and is associated with a higher seroconversion rate among adult immunocompromised patients. Given this potential benefit, [NACI says administration of the Moderna vaccine may be considered for some immunocompromised individuals 6 to 11 years of age](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/recommendations-use-moderna-spikevax-covid-19-vaccine-children-6-11-years-age.html) on a case-by-case basis. Most children younger than 5 years of age who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 have asymptomatic or mild disease. Hospitalization is rare and very few deaths have been reported. Nevertheless, some children experience severe disease, including previously healthy children. Children with chronic medical conditions are at higher risk for developing severe outcomes from COVID-19. Children who acquire SARS-CoV-2 are also at risk for developing a rare but serious post-infection complication known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). On July 14, 2022, Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Spikevax) was authorized by Health Canada for use in children 6 months to 5 years of age. This is the first COVID-19 vaccine authorized in Canada for use in children younger than 5 years old. Clinical trial data have shown that antibody responses to vaccine in children aged 6 months to 5 years are similar to those demonstrated in young adults, and that the vaccine is well tolerated with no safety signals reported. Reactogenicity was consistent with that observed with other vaccines recommended for use in this age group. Because post-marketing evidence for the use of COVID-19 vaccine in this age group is not yet available, and the clinical trial size was limited, the risk for rare adverse events remains unknown at this time. Preliminary data have shown that efficacy against confirmed, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection starting 14 days after dose 2 was 50.6% for children aged 6 to 23 months, and 36.5% for those aged 2 to 5 years. Efficacy against severe disease could not be determined because there were no severe cases in the vaccinated group and only one case (of MIS-C) in the placebo group. Of note, the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine contained the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and its efficacy was assessed during the Omicron era. Results are consistent with effectiveness data reported for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children 5 to 11 years of age during the Omicron wave. On July 14, 2022, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended that: 1) A primary series of two doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (25 mcg per dose) may be offered to children 6 months to 5 years of age, with an interval of at least 8 weeks between the first and second doses; 2) Children 6 months to 5 years of age who are moderately to severely immunocompromised may be immunized with a primary series of three doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (25 mcg per dose), with an interval of 4 to 8 weeks between doses. NACI also recommended that, at this time, the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine should not routinely be given concurrently (i.e., the same day) with other live or non-live vaccines, stating that it is advised to wait 14 days between vaccines to prevent erroneous attribution of an adverse event to one particular vaccine or the other, and stipulating that this suggested waiting period between vaccines is precautionary. NACI also acknowledged that it can be challenging for health care providers (HCPs) and parents when multiple immunization visits are required and that concurrent vaccine administration or a shortened interval between vaccines may be warranted on an individual basis, in some circumstances, at the clinical discretion of the HCP. The CPS recommends that COVID-19 vaccine be offered simultaneously with other required or routine vaccines unless there is assurance that timely administration of the other vaccines will not be compromised. Many children in Canada have missed routine immunizations during the current pandemic. For children 5 years of age, both the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines are available. The latter vaccine was authorized for children 5 to 11 years of age on November 19, 2021. NACI states that Moderna (25 mcg) may be offered to children 5 years of age as an alternative to Pfizer-BioNTech (10 mcg). The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is preferred, however. Higher rates of myocarditis were observed after Moderna vaccine than after Pfizer-BioNTech in older adolescents and young adults. The risk of myocarditis in children under 6 years of age is unknown but expected to be rare. For children who have received a previous dose of Moderna (25 mcg) but who turn 6 before completing their primary series, Moderna (50 mcg) is recommended. However, if the primary series has been completed using either the Moderna (25 mcg) or Pfizer-BioNTech (10 mcg) vaccine, the dose should be considered valid and the series complete. For children known to have been previously infected with SAR-CoV-2, NACI suggests an 8-week interval between infection (symptom onset or a positive test if the child was asymptomatic) and a dose of COVID-19 vaccine, to optimize immune response. This interval may be shortened to 4 to 8 weeks for immunocompromised children. Based on data from individuals 5 years of age and older, the duration of protection against Omicron infection from a primary series of COVID-19 vaccine is greater than that from infection alone, but protection wanes over time. Hybrid immunity (meaning immunity induced by vaccination plus infection) in adult populations is associated with greater breadth and duration of protection than infection or vaccination alone. Seroprevalence studies from Quebec and British Columbia estimate that 30% to 70% of children younger than 5 years old have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, with most of these infections occurring during the Omicron wave. Considerations for use of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 6 months to 5 years of age include the following: NACI recommends that obtaining informed consent from parents before administering Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to young children should include transparency about what is known (and what is as yet unknown) regarding the benefits and risks of using this vaccine in this age group. The information in this addendum is from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI's) full statement: [Recommendations on the use of Moderna Spikevax vaccine in children 6 months to 5 years of age](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/documents/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/recommendations-use-moderna-spikevax-covid-19-vaccine-children-6-months-5-years.pdf).
