I warmly welcome our amazing new students and look forward to getting to know you over the coming years! The incoming students represent diverse backgrounds, strengths and interests and will continue to enhance the dynamic atmosphere that is the hallmark of our Program. Our Program is constantly evolving, making sure that our graduates have the skills , insights and compassion to make a difference in today's world. Public Health is about everything we do as a society to promote, improve and protect the health of all individuals and communities. We are continuing to expand our academic program and course offerings, and have recruited new outstanding faculty. Our training programs include a Master of Public Health (MPH), a Dual MD -MPH, MSW -MPH (with the Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service) and DPM -MPH (with New York College of Podiatric Me dicine) degrees, a Master of Science in Epidemiology (MS in Epidemiology) , and an Advanced Certificate in Public Health . We have firmly established eight MPH tracks rounding out what is a comprehensive and interdisciplinary set of specializations in public health education. The MPH tracks include General Public Health, Epidemiology, Biostatistics, Environmental Health Sciences , Outcome s Research, Health Promotion & Disease Prevention, Health Care Management, and Gl obal Health. In partnership with the Counci l on Education for Public Health (CEPH), our accreditation agency, we are regularly adjusting our core curriculum and program competencies to meet future public health challenges. I encourage all students to reach out to the Program Administration, their Track Advisors and Course Directors early on to seek advice and mentorship. Meet with our outstanding and engaged faculty, staff and current students at ISMMS and become involved in public health research, advocacy and practice. A decade ago I worked as a public health manager in Sierra Leone. I helped set up an epidemiological surveillance system, supervised a malaria resistance study, and trained underpaid and therefore unmotivated health workers. Contact with patients was not the priority; I was suppose d to care for the national health policy and not for specific patients. Like all policies, national health policies are influenced by societal needs, economic capacities and, sometimes nationalistic sentiments. They do not aim to bring rapid relief to a suffering individual, but set conditions for a given society to become \"healthier\". Their slow evolution and implementation can often be tiring and frustrating. We all know of countless examples, from the ongoing challenges to enhance/improve vs. repeal/repl ace the Affordable Care Act here in the US, to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, globally. My vision for everyone in the Graduate Program in Public Health at ISMMS is that, as public health practitioners, we will always remember that for a human being in distress it is the here and now. Improving the health of human beings is the essence of public health. Keeping the individual at the center of all our work also means that we can approach overwhelming or unimaginable problems without despair. By focusing on the suffering human being, public health goes beyond mere analysis and implementation of health policies. It offers choices where there were none; it provides a human touch in an inhumane environment; and it may ultimately help reestablish huma n dignity. I welcome everyone in our program to make this a reality.

Application Process Medical stude nts accepted to Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai can apply to the Dual MD- MPH program. Interested students must complete a supplemental application, which consists of an essay describing their motivations for the Dual MD -MPH Degree Program. Accepted medical students do not need to submit a separate SOPHAS application online. We recommend, however, completing the essay at the earliest convenience upon acceptance to the ISMMS MD program. Students who have applied to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and wish to be considered for admission to the MPH Program even if they are not admitted to the medical school will need to complete a SOPHAS online application and should contact the Academic Program Office for more information. Other healthcare workers or physicians who are interns, residents or fellows at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai or working in the Mount Sinai Hospital must also submit an application via SOPHAS. Four -Year Option MD-MPH students choosing the Four Year Option take courses in the Graduate Program in Public Health beginning at 4 pm , after medical school classes have ended. Ty pically, four -year dual degree students complete all coursework and the Applied Practice Experience during the first two years of medical school and then complete the Culminating Experience during the last two years of medical school. Five-Year Option The five-year option allow s current and new students to devote an ent ire year to MPH d egree requirements . Students will be expected to complete a t least three core courses during their first year of medical school (Introduction to Biostatistics, Introduction to Epidemiology, and Introduction to Global Health or Public Health). Typically, during the fifth year, students will take a Scholarly Year to complete the MPH requirements . Complete information about how to arrange a Scholarly Year is in the Scholarly Year packet available from the Medical Student Research Office which is located in the Annenberg Building, 13 th floor room 13 -30. The timing of t he Scholarly Year is flexible and up to each student, though many may choose to begin the MPH year after completion of their third year medical clerkships. It is important to note that not all MPH specialty track s can be completed in this five -year optio n. Careful an d early planning with the Dual MD -MPH degree advisor is necessary in order to ensure completion of degree requirements. Furthermore, it is important that students speak with the Student Financial Services early on in their planning to ensure that all financial aid requirements are met. 14 Interested students should contact Academic Program Office to set up an appointment to discuss their individual interests and needs. Dual MD -MPH Degree Expectations and Credit Bene fits Students who are pur suing a medical degree and a Master of Public Health degree must meet with the MD -MPH Academic Advisor at the beginning of the first year to plan for the next two years of coursework. Students pursuing both degrees have special demands that require careful attention to planning their public health courses along with medical school curricula. MD-MPH students benefit from pursuing both degrees simultaneously. MD -MPH students may earn a maximum value of 12 MPH credits by com pleting certain MD requirements. P lease see the list of credit benefits below. Ambulatory Care Clerkship: 4 MPH credits. This course is taken by medical students during Year 3 and has an emphasis on Clinical Preventive medicine as well as population medicine. Students incorporate population- based medicine and evidence -based medicine into direct patient care by analyzing and applying USPSTF Guidelines; socio- behavioral models of health and illness; and culturally sensitive models of care giving. InFocus Weeks: Maximum of 8 MPH credits. InFoc us weeks are innovative and immersive courses taught through all four years of the medical school curriculum.

Advising MPH students must read and continually reference the Stude nt Handbook, Curriculum Guide, Applied Practice Experience Guide , Culminating Experience Guide, Track Checklist, and Sample Curricula to understand the expectations of the degree . These resources are available on Blackboard. Students should contact the Aca demic Program Office with questions regarding degree requirements . Students are expected to seek guidance from their Specialty Track Advisor regarding their interest in specific topics in public health. Specialty Track Advisors can provide information and advice regarding elective courses, Applied Practice Experience and Culminating Experience opportunities, proposals, competencies, and development, as well as information on the public health profession. PROGRAM COMPETENCIES The Graduate Program in Publ ic Health adopted the following 22 foundational public health competencies in January 2019. The foundational competencies are put forth by the Council on Education for Public Health. These competencies are informed by the traditional public health core knowledge areas, (biostatistics, epidemiology, social and behavioral sciences, health services administration and environmental health sciences), as well as cross -cutting and emerging public health areas. The Program also maintains a list of track -specific co mpetencies and curriculum development . The competencies shall be the primary guide against which student achievement is measured in the classroom, in the Applied Practice Experience , in the Culminating Experience, as well as in other service -learning opportunities. Going forward, the Program Competencies herein replace those in previous iterations of the Student Handbook and all other program materials. Students should understand that the Program C ompetencies are not intended to represent an endpoint that is reached at the time of graduation , or expect in every case a one -to-one correlation to a particular class or exercise. Rather , these competencies provide a baseline overview of the knowledge, skills, and other attributes that might be expected for eme rging public health professionals . The foundational competencies serve as a framework for Program development, and for continual professional development that is driven by the student. Completion of the program will assure that all students have demonstrat ed the student's ability to perform the foundational competencies. COMPETENCY SURVEY All matriculated students are required to complete a Competency Survey each academic year in the Program . Students are asked to self -evaluate their level of mastery of each Program Competency using the measures below. As adult learners who are autonomous, self-directed, and goal oriented, students are encouraged to use the results of their Competency Surveys to monitor their own progress through the Program. Aggregate data from the Competency Surveys are useful to the Program because they provide an assessment of how well course, Applied Practice Experience , and Culminating Experience competencies are transmitted to the students, and whether there is a need for revision o f current courses or creation of new courses or experiences to enhance achievement of the competencies. 20 FOUNDATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH COMPETENCIES Evidence -based Approaches to Public Health 1.

Students are required to take the cours es listed for the Specialty Track they choose to pursue. The credits accrued from required courses vary for each Specialty Track. In total, students must complete 45 credits to be eligible to earn the Master of Public Health. Students will be asked to de clare which specialty track they are pursuing or whether they have decided to follow the General Public Health Track after their first term in the Program. The Specialty Tracks are: General Public Health Health Promotion & Disease Prevention Environment al Health Sciences Global Health Outcomes Research Biostatistics Health Care Management Epidemiology General Public Health Track Specialization is not required and students are free to pursue a general program of study consisting of an amalgamation of courses across all specialty tracks. General Track students, however, must still complete a set of required courses from each of the five areas of basic public health knowledge: biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health sciences, health services ad ministration, and social/behavioral sciences. Demonstrate ability to employ a public health systems approach to assess the health status of populations, to identify determinants of health and illness, and to ascertain factors influencing the use of health services. Utilize basic biostatistical concepts and appropriate study design methodologies to address public health research questions and to evaluate community -based interventions. Apply descriptive and analytic epidemiology to population- based research, and develop disease control and prevention programs in conjunction with the community. Specify approaches for assessing, preventing and controlling environmental and occupational hazards that pose risks to human health and safety. Design, implement and ev aluate public health programs and policies within a socio- ecological framework. Apply principles of cultural competency to health promotion/disease prevention programs, policies and research, to improve patient and community health, and to reduce health di sparities. Support, promote and develop public health advocacy that informs, educates and empowers communities about public health issues and effects systems changes. 22 Health Promotion & Disease Prevention Track The Health Promotion & Disease Prevention t rack builds on the long and rich tradition of Mount Sinai's collaboration with the East Harlem community in the promotion of health and the prevention of disease. Students who pursue the Heath Promotion & Disease Prevention Specialty Track will learn how t o improve the public's health by working with individuals and their communities. This track emphas izes community level interventions through a curriculum developed to reflect the World Health Organization's 1986 Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion: \" Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health.\" Students in this track achieve the competencies necessary to assist communities in effective action in setting priorities, making decisions, planning stra tegies and implementing them to achieve better health. At the heart of this process is the empowerment of communities, their ownership and control of their own endeavors and destinies. Additionally, this track looks at individual behavior as a major dete rminant of health and helps students develop into public health practitioners capable of influencing social norms that provide a framework for health promotion and disease prevention across life stages. Students in this track learn how to collaborate with agencies, institutions and community -based organizations that influence the social determinants of health to foster the development and implementation of policy and environmental strategies that enable healthy individual behaviors. Topics addressed include nutrition and physical activity, chronic disease prevention and control, health literacy, health communications, injury control and prevention, aging/health and disabilities, men's health and women's health, as well as children's health. Particular emphas is is placed on the elimination of disparities in health outcomes. Examples of projects undertaken in this track over the past few years include: working on accurately recording all pediatric vaccinations given in New York City through collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; creating educational tools and evaluating effectiveness of those tools in a population of HIV/hepatitis C infected substance abusers; working to establish an Arab- American clinic at Mount Sinai; de veloping an obesity education program for the East Harlem community. Apply behavioral and social science theory in the development, implementation, and evaluation of health promotion interventions, programs, and policies. Design an intervention or program to effect change at multiple levels, including individual, community, and policy levels. Develop a plan to monitor and evaluate the quality, impact and outcomes of public health interventions. Describe the health, economic, administrative, legal, social and political implications of policy options, and provide strategic advice on health promotion and disease prevention issues. Examine the psychosocial, historical, and environmental causes of health disparities in the planning, implementation, and evaluatio n of health promotion and intervention programs. Outcomes Research Track The MPH Outcomes Research Specialty Track gives students the necessary tools to contribute to the body of knowledge that determines how health care practices and interventions affect end results. End results include effects that people experience and care about, such as change in the ability to function. In particular, for individuals with chronic conditions \u2014where cure is not always possible \u2014end results include quality of life a s well as mortality. By linking the care people get to the outcomes they 23 experience, outcomes research has become the key to developing better ways to monitor and improve the quality of care. Time and again, studies have shown that medical practices as c ommonplace as hysterectomy and hernia repair were performed much more frequently in some areas than in others, even when there were no differences in the underlying rates of disease. Furthermore, there was often no information about the end results for the patients who received a particular procedure, and few comparative studies to show which interventions were most effective. These findings challenged researchers, clinicians, and health systems leaders to develop new tools to assess the impact of health care services. The Outcomes Research Specialty Track gives students the competencies necessary to develop new evidence about benefits, risks, and results of treatments so that patients, physicians, public health practitioners and policy makers can make more informed decisions. Examples of projects undertaken in this track over the past few years include: evaluating role of persistent depression in adherence to secondary prevention behaviors after acute coronary syndromes; evaluating differences in preventive services offered by gynecologists and generalists; food allergy as a risk factor for asthma morbidity in adults; determining factors associated with adherence to influenza vaccine among inner city adults with persistent asthma; association between minor and major surgical complications after carotid endarterectomy. Identify, analyze and interpret major clinical and public health problems and relevant clinical epidemiology, outcomes and health services research questions Identify, interpret and critique the state of knowledge regarding clinical epidemiology, outcomes, health services research questions and public health policy Explain the relative advantages and disadvantages of observational and experimental methods and study design used in clinical epide miology, outcomes and health services research Specify the measurement of structure, process, and outcome in health and health care research and implications for improving outcomes Discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages between efficacy and ef fectiveness research Global Health Track The MPH Global Health Track is designed for students interested in acquiring the competencies necessary to bring practical solutions to the health problems of underserved and neglected populations in resource poor settings worldwide. Many of the greatest challenges in public health are global. Experts in global health and individuals with a sense of responsibility towards populations lacking adequate access to health care are needed to help solve the many health problems these populations face. The MPH Global Health Specialty Track fosters the acquisition of the competencies necessary to bring positive, lasting change to challenged populations around the world. The Global Health Specialty Track includes both dida ctic and practical experience designed to allow students to accomplish the competencies determined necessary to be global health practitioners. Classes feature many world -renowned lecturers from the fields of medicine, public health, social sciences, healt h economics and health management, as well as experts from NGOs and government policy makers. The courses are designed to give students a thorough understanding of the principles of public health, with special emphasis on globalization and human rights, and the arguments surrounding the interrelation of these fields of study. 24 In addition to the core course work an MPH with a global health emphasis includes coursework that covers a wide variety of topics such as equitable distribution of life -saving drugs, the health impact of asylum seekers, global communicable diseases, global trade, humanitarian aid and the public health impact of military intervention. Students acquire practical skills that enable them to work successfully in a wide variety of settings with diverse populations both domestically and abroad. With constant interaction between students and instructors, discussion and debate are important features of this course of study. Students are encouraged to pursue locations and study topics that are of particular interest to them. Examples of projects undertaken in this track over the past few years include: working to improve the health of residents in India through child health nutrition programs and community education; examining the role of alter native and complementary medicine in villagers in rural outpatient settings in India; designing and teaching a basic public health curriculum in a local college in the Spirit Lake Nation of the Native American Dakota Tribe; performing targeted needs assess ments in rural Kenya through collaboration with the International Rescue Committee which serves refugees affected by violent conflict. Explain the global context in which public health problems occur including the social, political, and economic forces that shape these problems and their potential solutions. Apply social justice and human rights principles in the development of public health programs, interventions and policies. Apply scientific evidence in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health programs and interventions. Describe the roles and relationships of the organizations and entities that influence global health. Identify the leadership & management skills needed to effectively lead local, national, & global public health systems and affect public health policies. Describe multi -agency policy -making in response to complex health emergencies. Design a community health needs assessment and plan an evidence -based intervention that meets an established health target. Environment al Health Sciences Specialty Track The Environmental Health Sciences Specialty Track focuses on environmental exposures that affect human health that arise from air, water, food, work, and the built environment that affect the health of individuals a nd communities. This t rack also explore s global environmental issues like climate change, and highlight emerging pollutants of concern and cutting -edge research on chemical exposures and fetal origins of adult diseases. Throughout the coursework and practical e xperiences, students will learn applicable principles of toxicology, environmental epidemiology, exposure and risk assessment, and strategies to prevent disease, as well as fundamentals of laws and regulation that address environmental and occupational haz ards. Students also learn to recognize, address, and prevent common environmental and occupational health threats such as heavy metals, asthma triggers, pesticides, and solvents. The Environmental Health Sciences Track is interdisciplinary and considers the broader context of environmental exposures and their contribution to health disparities on a local, national, and global scale. Students will gain a core skill set that will prepare them to become leaders in this important and growing field of public health. Assess environmental and occupational exposures Prevent and control environmental and occupational hazards 25 Identify the adverse effects of chemical, biological, and physical exposures on human health Interpret epidemiologic and other research fi ndings related to environmental risks, and assist in designing and conducting research Synthesize relevant information in order to analyze EOH policy implications, participate in policy development, and assess and manage occupational risks Engage in publ ic health communication and risk communication activities Biostatistics Track The Biostatistics Track provides students the necessary statistical reasoning and methodology skills to effectively design, assess, and analyze studies of the effectiveness and safety of therapeutic interventions, the characteristics and distribution of diseases in populations, health services research, and programs of health care delivery. The Biostatistics Track builds on the core curriculum in the MPH program to offer st udents a practical foundation in biostatistics through courses in important areas such as statistical inference, probability, multivariable models, analysis of longitudinal and time to event (or survival) data, genetics, and statistical computing. This foundation is meant to be a springboard to launching a successful career in clinical research, for both clinical researchers seeking quantitative skills and those seeking careers as biostatisticians. Demonstrate ability to apply biostatistics and engage in c ollaborative public health research Apply the necessary quantitative, logical, and computational skills to successfully collaborate within clinical research teams Translate clinical questions into statistical hypotheses Effectively summarize public health data using both numerical and graphical techniques Utilize basic probability concepts and optimal study designs Devise effective means of data collection Develop analytical strategies that take account of the specific qualities of data to be analyzed, sources of variation, and assumptions required Interpret quantitative results and their implications for public health Effectively communicate co mplicated statistical concepts and results to clinical colleagues and community partners Health Care Management Track The Health Care Management Specialty Track prepares graduates for positions of leadership and management in public health, health, government and community service organizations. Students will learn competencies in strategic, ethical and accountable management practices, in state of the art human resource management and supervision, in the techniques of finance and budgeting, the use of quantitative tools for management accountability and for managing cost effective health care and they will learn to design, implement and evaluate programs and projects. The Health Care Management specialty track curriculum provides competency -based learning in organizational development and organization behavior, including theory and application, team 26 leadership , relationship building, collaboration and community orientation, social marketing, public relations and communication and information systems management and assessment. Apply theories of organizational analysis, organizational behavior and financial anal ysis to managing and leading public health and health organizations.

Develop skills in team management, collaboration and leadership to effect change at multiple levels. Appropriately manages various health care payment methodologies for diverse at risk populations Develop market analyses of population based problems, and initiate community partnerships in service development and evaluation . Epidemiology Track The epidemiology track provides students with the skills necessary to analyze public health trends, design and implement studies, and interpret the results fo r policy and program development. They also learn to investigate disease origins, and prevention and intervention strategies at the individual and societal levels. The program prepares graduates to take on leadership roles in clinical and population- based health research in government, health care institutions, and private industry. In addition to the MPH- required coursework in health policy and management, socio- behavioral health, and occupational and environmental health, students take epidemiology tra ck-specific coursework in epidemiology, biostatistics, and clinical outcomes research. Students are required to take two elective classes in specialized areas of epidemiology. Electives are available in infectious disease, chronic disease, molecular, gen etic, and environmental and occupational epidemiology. Describe a public health problem in terms of magnitude, person, time, and place. Calculate basic epidemiological measures. Evaluate the strengths and limitations of epidemiological studies. Interp ret results of statistical analyses found in public health studies. Critically synthesize the public health research and practice literature for a selected health topic. Conduct an epidemiological and biostatistical data analysis. Distinguish between a sta tistical association and a causal relationship using appropriate principle of casual inference. Identify appropriate methods of study design, analysis, and data synthesis to address population- based health problems Identify circumstances under which non- randomized (observational) designs are the best approach to addressing important he alth-related knowledge gaps. Recognize the assumptions and limitations of common statistical methods and choose appropriate approaches for analysis. Use tabular and graphical methods to explain model results. 27 Specialty Track Advisors Students in each Track are strongly encouraged to contact their Track Advisor early on and regularly throughout their time at ISMMS. Track Advisors are an important resource, and can provide information and advice regarding elective courses, Applied Practice Experience, and Culminating Experience opportunities, proposals, competencies, and development , as well as information on the public health profession.

Students will implement and practice lessons learned in the classroom, gaining exposure to new and e xciting prospects for future professional development. It is a planned, supervised, and evaluated field- based experience that can take place at a variety of agencies and organizations, involving some level of community engagement. The Applied Practice Expe rience enables students to achieve many of the competencies necessary to be successful public health practitioners. In the past, students have met this requirement by working at the community level, for example, in East Harlem; at the city level, working with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; and at the international level, working on a disaster relief project in a foreign setting. Whatever the student's choice, the focus is on immersion into the setting selected. The Program requires tha t the APE encompass a minimum time commitment of 150 -hours. To satisfy the APE, students must achieve at least five program competencies (three of which must be foundational) through completion of two or more work products. Most students complete their wo rk products at a single site as part of a practicum/internship. The work products are determined by the student and the preceptor, and should be mutually beneficial to both the student and the site. Examples of work products include written assignments, journal entries, projects, videos, presentations, spreadsheets, websites, or posters. Specifically, a work product might be a training manual, policy analysis, curriculum, grant proposal, needs assessment, educational materials, program evaluation, literatur e review, surveys, guidelines, etc. Generally, the student is advised to begin thinking about areas of interest as early as the first term of the first year. Steps toward formalizing the Applied Practice Experience usually occur in the second or third t erm. Students are eligible to begin the Applied Practice Experience after completion of fifteen credits in the Program. It is strongly suggested (though not required) that the student consider the Applied Practice Experience as laying the groun dwork for th e Culminating Experience . Project i deas should be discussed with the Specialty Track Advisors. All MPH students are required to complete an Applied Practice Experience. Students must obtain approval from the Preceptor, Track Advisor, and the Office of Public Health Practice prior to initiating the project to ensure relevancy to Public Health, to confirm the proposed experience will meet the criteria of the Applied Practice Experience requirement, and to assure that the student is able to maximize his/h er learning opportunities. Students must complete all requirements, including submission of all necessary forms, for the Applied Practice Experience in order to receive credit for their experience. We do not grant waivers of the Applied Practice Experience. Requirements for the Applied Practice Experience : Attendance at an APE Information Session Submission of the APE Proposal and Proposal Form Registration for MPH0092 Applied Practice Experience - 3 credits Students who matriculated before Fall 2017 will re gister for MPH0090 Practicum - 0 credits Completion of a minimum of 150 hours at an approved practice site Completion of a minimum of two work products Attainment of at least 5 competencies 29 At least 3 competencies must be Foundational Competencies Submissi on of the APE Postscript Report Completion of Final Evaluation Submission of the Preceptor Evaluation Competency Assessment Participation in a Checkout Meeting with the Office of Public Health Practice This information, along with a more detailed descript ion of the Applied Practice requirement, can be found in the Applied Practice Experience Guide on Blackboard > MPH Students Organization . Office of Public Health Practice Program Manager, Public Health Practice CULMINATING EXPERIENCE All MPH students a re required to complete a Culminating Experience. The Culminating Experience is typically started towards the end of the student's first year and completed by the end of the second year. The goal is for students to synthesize, integrate and apply the skill s and competencies they have acquired to a public health problem. Students may choose to complete a Master's Thesis, First Author Manuscript or Capstone to satisfy the Culminating Experience. The type of project completed will depend on the student's S pecialty T rack and topic of interest. The Culminating Experience must be completed under the direction of an ISMMS F aculty Advisor. The ISMMS Faculty Advisor may or may not be the student's S pecialty Track Advisor. Students can identify another ISMMS faculty member to serve as their ISMMS Faculty A dvisor as appropriate. If a student is working closely with an offsite mentor, this mentor may serve as a co -advisor /second reader alongside an ISMMS F aculty Advisor . Once an ISMMS Faculty Advisor has been determi ned, the student must submit the Statement of Support with an approved outline of the project to Academic Program Office. This Statement of Support must be submitted prior to initiating any research or project to ensure relevancy to public health. The Cu lminating Experience requires : One written Thesis, First Author Manuscript or Capstone formatted according to applicable guidelines as outlined in the Culminating Experience Guide Two Oral Presentations o Public Health Research Day Poster Session in the Spri ng II term before graduation o 10-minute Oral Presentation to summarizing their Thesis, First Author Manuscript, or Capstone project to the ISMMS Faculty Advisor and Second Reader Forms documenting the experience o Statement of Support - submitted before beginning work o Evaluation - submitted after the Oral Presentation o Deposit Form - submi tted after the Oral Presentation o Other documentation as detailed in the Culminating Experience Guide 30 Description of the Thesis, First Author Manuscript & Capstone Below are g eneral descriptions of each of the three types of projects . Please read the Culminating Experience Guide on Blackboard for all details regarding the Culminating Experience. Master's Thesis The goal of the T hesis is to advance or create new knowledge to an existing body of research. The student develops a research question and a hypothesis based on previous research on the topic. The student gathers data (either through primary or secondary data collection) and analyzes the data, usually with statistical a nalysis software, such as SAS or SPSS. The findings are then discussed as to whether or not they support the hypothesis. The study should be designed so that the results of the analysis are generalizable to a larger population, rather than the sample used in the student's data analysis. First Author Manuscript The First Author M anuscript must be written in publishable format for a selected scholarly journal. Students meet with their Specialty Track Advisor and Culminating Experience ISMMS Faculty Advisor to determine which journal is most appropriate for their topic. The format of the paper is based on the formatting guidelines for submission as outlined by the selected journal. Capstone This scholarly project is much more applied in nature. The C apstone is a scholarly project developed for and with consultation of a public health organization or community agency. Generally, the capstone builds directly upon the Applied Practice Experience (formerly known as the Practicum experience ) in that the student produces a deliverable based on the needs of the Applied Practice Experience site. The C apstone can take on several forms, including: Community Needs Assessment Public Health Program Plan Program Evaluation Training Manual Policy Analysis Systematic Li terature Review Grant Proposal Public Health Research Day Public Health Research Day, held annually by the Graduate Program in Public Health, is a required event for all MPH students. All graduating MPH students are required to present posters during the Public Health Research Day. The Public Health Research Day Committee will select the 3 top -ranked abstracts for oral presentations, and each will receive a Blue Ribbon Award with an honorarium. All other students are required to attend the day's events. Public Health Research Day showcases MPH student thesis, manuscript, and capstone projects. In addition to the annual poster session, the event will include a keynote lecture, oral presentations, and a networking reception. This is an excellent opportunity for networking among students, faculty, alumni, and community stakeholders, and to gain experience in presenting your work to an audience with diverse professional interests. 31 All graduating students are encouraged to prepare in advance for Public Health Research Day. The Culminating Experience Abstract for Public Health Research Day will be due in early April, and the poster will be due in early May.

E diting (e.g. syntax assistance for foreign students) should be sought only if explicit permission is obtained. If faculty observe or have knowledge of students engaging in any of the above -mentioned activities, the student should be confronted by the r elevant faculty member at once. Students and faculty who believe that any of the above -mentioned activities have o ccurred will contact the Program Director and/or the Academic Advisory Chair and/or Academic Advisory Committee which has the authority to discipline students up to and including dismissal. If necessary, the case will be elevated to the leadership of the I cahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. If it is determined that the student has been involved in any form of academic misconduct, the student may receive an F for the assignment or course. Additional consequences, including dismissal from the program, are at the discretion of the Program Director. If the student wishes to appeal the decision of the Academic Advisory Committee, this must be put in writing to Academic Advisory Chair within two weeks of receiving notification of the consequences of the incid ent of academic misconduct. The issue will then be pursued, via an appropriate tribunal, in accord with institutional policy on the ethical conduct of research. (Adapted from http://www.northw estern.edu/uacc/defines.html ; used with permission, D. Garrison) POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ON ETHICAL PRACTICES IN RESEARCH The School hereby affirms its commitment to the highest ethical standards in the conduct of scientific research, the promotion of original research of high quality, and the importance of academic freedom. It also acknowledges that unethical conduct in research is extremely serious and threatens these principles. The School is, therefore, committed to preventing unethical conduct in r esearch from occurring and, should it occur, to dealing with it swiftly, fairly and thoroughly. Procedures for handling allegations of misconduct in research are described in detail in the Faculty Handbook (Chapter VI) . More detailed information can be accessed on the ISMMS Student Handbook and Policies website . Allegations of misconduct in research must be reported to the Institution's Research Integrity Officer (RIO) who will have primary responsibility for implementation of the institution's policies and procedure s on unethical practices in research. The RIO has general responsibility for overseeing the investigation of all allegations of unethical conduct in research and shall be available to: Consult confidentially with persons uncertain about whether to submit an allegation of unethical research practices and if the allegations do not involve unethical practices in research, refer the individual to other offices with responsibility for resolving the issue. 40 Receive allegations of suspected unethical research practices and work with the Research Integrity Committee to determine and pursue the appropriate method for investigating and resolving these allegations. AUTHORSHIP POLICY In conformity with the principles of academic freedom, faculty and students are not required to obtain prior approval before submitting a manuscript for publication or to amend such manuscripts to comply with suggestions made by others. However, it is recommended they provide Department Chairpersons with copies of manuscripts prior to publication. Students who wish to submit a manuscript to a journal from ISMMS or describe work conducted at ISMMS must review and obtain approval from a faculty member. That review should include the appropriateness of the authorship(s) and acknowledgment(s ) of grant support, as well as the substance of the report. The Program adheres to the Authorship Policy, the Policy on Responsibilities of Authors a nd data Reten tion, and Policy and Procedures on Protecting Whistleblowers as established by the Graduate Sc hool and Department of Medical Education, outlined in the respective handbooks . Assignment of authorship documents the contributions individuals have made to a published work. Thus, authorship constitutes a key criterion by which funding agencies, academic institutions, and the wider academic community judge the contributions of academics to their fields. Appropriate assignment of authorship is an essential component of ethical conduct for academics. Authorship on a publication implies substantial contribution to work being reported, which entails critical intellectual and/or technical contributions without which the publication as it exists would not have been possible. Contribut ions that merit authorship include a significant role in planning the studies, writing the manuscript, and other essential roles involving unique skills. The International Commit tee of Medical Journal Editors guidelines recommend that each author have responsibility for at least one component of the work, and that all authors approve the final version. Listing the explicit contributions of each author, as many journals currently require, is indeed a valuable and recommended method for disclosing and clarify ing the rationale for the inclusion and order of authors. The contributions of colleagues or collaborators whose participation does not warrant authorship should be acknowledged. The requirement of substantial contribution clearly precludes unethical prac tices such as honorary authorships for senior colleagues who made minimum contributions to the work, colleagues whose role was solely to obtain funding or similar resources for the work, or contracted individuals who simply carried out routine services for hire. This same principle precludes omitting from authorship colleagues who did make substantial contributions. Ghostwriting, in which an individual takes credit as an author of a manuscript substantially written by an uncredited third party, is never per missible. In summary, authorship credit can be established by the following three criteria: (1) providing substantial contributions to study concept and design, or acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data critical for the study; (2) drafting the a rticle or revising its content critically; and (3) approving the final version to be published. All authors listed on an article must fulfill criteria (1) and/or (2), and must fulfill criterion (3). It is expected that inclusion and order of authors will be discussed among all of the authors (including students and postdoctoral fellows). This should occur as early in the research process as possible, prior to drafting the manuscript when feasible and certainly prior to submission of the manuscript for ini tial peer review. Such dialogue is essential for all manuscripts and requires exceptional attention in collaborations involving multiple laboratories or institutions. Whether a contribution is substantial 41 enough to merit authorship may sometimes be a matte r of judgment, usually decided by the senior author(s). After authorship and order of authorship have been assigned by the senior author(s), in consultation with, and preferably also in agreement with all authors, the senior author(s) should be able to def end the assignments based on the principles articulated above; final decision on authorship rests with the senior author(s). Members of the research team are strongly urged to resolve any disagreements concerning authorship as quickly and amicably as possi ble, in order to avoid ongoing disputes that could impede or prevent publication of a manuscript. Policy on Financial Conflict of Interest in Research As an academic institution, ISMMS has an obligation to assure that its scientific and clinical resear ch is conducted pursuant to the highest standards of ethical conduct free from any improper external bias. At the same time, ISMMS encourages scientific collaboration with industry and supports collaborative research geared towards developing new and impro ved diagnostic and therapeutic products. ISMMS appreciates, however, that these economic relationships with industry have the potential for directly and significantly affecting the approval, design, conduct, monitoring or reporting of a research study. Sit uations can occur in which an independent observer might reasonably conclude that the potential for individual or institutional profit could influence the outcome of a research study. Even in the absence of an actual conflict of interest, such situations m ay require actions to minimize the appearance of a conflict. Therefore, to safeguard the academic integrity of both ISMMS and its investigators, the institution has adopted a rigorous conflicts policy predicated on full disclosure and appropriate manageme nt. The Policy sets out the requirements for disclosing potential conflicts of interest in research and specifies the procedures for reviewing such disclosures and determining what corrective measures, if any, should be instituted. Furthermore, the policy subjects clinical trials that evaluate the safety and efficacy of a drug, medical device or treatment, and research on technology in which the Investigator/ Covered Person and/or the Institution has an ongoing financial interest, to the most rigorous review and stringent conditions. This Policy is based on the standards set forth in the federal regulations governing research funded by the Public Health Servic e (PHS) or the National Science Foundation (NSF) (42 CFR Part 50 Subpart F) and the recommendations promulgated by the Association of Academic Medical Centers. 42 HONOR CODE FOR ISMMS EXAMS & QUIZZES Course Directors in the Graduate Program in Publ ic Health may enforce the following honor code. Before taking all exams or quizzes, students must review and agree to abide by the following rules of conduct: I will take this exam or quiz by myself, not in a group. 1.

The Registrar's Office is the steward of student records from application to degree conferral in perpetuity. The Registrar's key functions in carrying out this mission focus on guarding the integrity and security of all student records in accordance with ethical and legal standards, maintaining accurate and timely records of academic progress in order to provide definitive student status, and providing students with enrollment services necessary to pursue their educational goals. To that end, below please find information pertaining to the policies and procedures under the purview of the Registrar's Office. For additional information about the Registrar's services, please contact the Re gistrar staff in Annenberg 12 -70, (212) 241- 5245. ACADEMIC STANDING Students may be terminated (i.e., administratively withdrawn or dismissed) from a degree program at any time if, in the judgment of the Graduate School or the School of Medicine, a student fails to make satisfactory progress towards the completion of the degree (regardless of grades). The definition of satisfactory progress toward completion of the deg ree program may diff er among degree offering units. Examples of unsatisfactory progress may include, but are not limited to, inadequate grade point average (GPA), inadequate research and/or research skills, failure to obtain satisfactory grades in required courses, failure to maintain matriculation in the Program, and may also relate to the amount of time to complete the required milestones of the curriculum. Program Specific Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy Master of Public Health students maintain satisfactory academic progress by: Making progress toward core and track courses. This includes successfully completing required core courses within 2 attempts of taking the courses. Grades that are not considered a successful completion include: incomple te, missing grades, withdraws, and failing grades (F or below minimum). Successfully completing at least 50% of course credits attempted each semester. Resolving incomplete grades within the guidelines established by ISMMS. Attaining an overall grade point average of 3.0 is needed at the time of graduation to be eligible to earn the degree. Students who earn a GPA below 3.0 should raise their GPA within 3 consecutive terms to maintain Program Specific Satisfactory Academic Progress . Making progress towar d degree requirements as outlined in the Applied Practice Experience Guide and Culminating Experience Guide. Demonstrating the ability to grow in professional skills. Students are expected to complete their degree program within the maximum time to earn degree prescribed for their degree, as outlined in the Graduate Program in Public Health Student Handbook. Master of Science in Epidemiology students maintain satisfactory progress by: Making progress toward core and track courses. This includes successful ly completing required core courses within 2 attempts of taking the courses. Grades that are not considered a successful completion include: incomplete, missing grades, withdraws, and failing grades (F or below minimum). 44 Successfully completing at least 50 % of course credits attempted each semester. Resolving incomplete grades within the guidelines established by ISMMS. Attaining an overall grade point average of 3.0 is needed at the time of graduation to be eligible to earn the degree. Students who earn a GPA below 3.0 should raise their GPA within 3 consecutive terms to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. Making progress toward degree requirements as outlined in the Culminating Experience Guide. Demonstrating the ability to grow in professional ski lls. Students are expected to complete their degree program within the maximum time to earn degree prescribed for their degree, as outlined in the Graduate Program in Public Health Student Handbook Below are the categories of student standing: Good Standing A student will be considered in Good Standing if they meet minimal academic standards in terms of course performance and degree requirements, school standards and deadlines for health assessments, immunization status, PPD testing, pay all bills on time including tuition and fees, remain free of any academic or administrative holds, and are otherwise m eeting the academic expectations of their degree program . Probation Students who do not meet the criteria for Good Standing may be placed on probation by the Program Director, Dean of the Graduate School, or their appointed representatives: including the Academic Advisory Committee and the Academic Program Office . Once a student is placed on academic probation, academic progress must be made within two terms. Dismissal is the likely consequence if performance continues to be unsatisfactory. Students on probation are considered enrolled. Students are required to maintain a 3.0 Grade Point Average (GPA). Students who fall below a GPA of 3.0 will be place d on academic probation. Anytime a student's GPA falls below 3.0, the Academic Program Office and the Academic Advisory Committee will be consulted and a plan for remediation developed. The student will meet with a member of the Academic Advisory Committee , develop an individual plan of remediation, and sign a statement of understanding that they are on academic probation. The Academic Advisory Committee meets at the end of each term and reviews the progress of each student on probation. If the GPA has not improved in the subsequent term, the student will continue to meet the Academic Advisory Committee member revising the remediation plan, as needed. If the student's GPA has not reached 3.0 within two terms having been placed on probation, the student may be dismissed from the program. Forward Feeding Information regarding a student's academic status and any documented issues related to professionalism may be forwarded from the Graduate Program in Public Health to a course dir ector, faculty advisor, or practice experience preceptor at the discretion of the Program leadership . Personal 45 information will not be forwarded except when requested by the student. The student will be notified that this transfer of information is taking place . Forward feeding al lows for monitoring of a student's performance and to provide support and remediation as necessary. The forwarding of any material to a subsequent course or clerkship directors will continue as long as monitoring is necessary for educational purposes. WITHDRAWAL AND READMISSION Voluntary Withdrawal A student may voluntarily withdraw from school at any time, upon application to the Academic Program Office . The request must be made by submitting a Request for Withdrawal Form. A student who voluntarily wi thdraws may apply for readmission at a later time. Future reinstatement may be denied either at the time of the withdrawal or at the time of application for reinstatement for reasons deemed sufficient to the Admissions Committee. T he School may require an Administrative Evaluation prior to acceptance of a withdrawal. Failure to comply may result in dismissal. For further information on withdrawing from the Pr ogram, refer to the Academic Program Office. Administrative Withdrawal In certain circumstances, a student may be administratively withdrawn from the school. Examples may include, but are not limited to: a student who has exceeded the limit of medical or personal leave ; a student who fails to maintain matriculation in the degree program, a student who repeatedly fails a course ; any student failing to pay tuition, fees, medical insurance, or housing bills by the required dates. Dismissal Dismissal is a withdrawal from the School for failing to maintain \"Good Standing\" or meet standard educational goal s of the degree program. Students who are dismissed are not enrolled. The Program Director or Academic Program Office may administratively dismiss a student. Status of dismissal is permanently reflected on a student's academic record. Dismissals will gen erally be imposed for students who exhibit the following: failure to meet academic milestones, failure to remediate academic probation status, positive toxicology result, disruptive behavior, illegal behavior, misconduct, or failure to meet administrative responsibilities (including financial obligations). Dismissal may result when a student is convicted of a misdemeanor or felony, exhibits a breach of academic or professional misconduct (including cheating). Any student who fails to comply with a directive to undergo an administrative evaluation or fails to fulfill the requirements that stems from this evaluation will be dismissed from the Graduate School. Clearance to Graduate, Begin Leaves of Absence, Withdraw, Transfer, or Otherwise Leave The School Students who wish to graduate, begin a Leave of Absence, Withdraw, Transfer or otherwise leave the School must obtain clearance beforehand from the Graduate Program in Public Health. Students are required to meet with the Graduate Program in Public Health before filling out the appropriate forms.

No guarantee of readmission is made to any student. ACADEMIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE The Academic Advisory Committee consists of an appointed Chair and several Program Adminis tration and faculty members . The goal of the A cademic Advisory Committee is to monitor the acad emic progress of students in the P rogram. The Committee meets regularly to review the academic standing of all students. The Academic Advisory Committee also r eviews cases of misconduct, unprofessional behavior and other grievances and has the authority to discipline students up to and including dismissal and expulsion. Both students and/or f aculty members with concerns about any of the above should contact the Academic Program Office or the Chair of the Academic Advisory Committee, who will review the information, meet with those involved, investigate to gather all pertinent information, and forward this information to the Academic Advisory Committee for review and, if required, recommended action. Recommendation from the Academic Advisory Committee will be communicated to the Program Director or Academic Program Office . HOLDS The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai utilizes a system of holds when students fail to meet standard educational obligations. A \"hold\": 1. Prevents the release of a student's academic transcript or any school documentation , e.g., enrollment verification letter . 2. Freezes a student's registration status so that they may not register for courses until the hold is resolved . 3. Freezes a student's registration status so that they may not continue on to the next term until the hold is resolved by the student . All financial obligations must be satisfied before a student can register for another term and continue their studies and/or research. Students with holds will not be eligible for financial aid refunds until the hold is appropriately addressed by the student. Types of ISMMS holds: Admissions, Academic, Administrative, Student Health , Housing, Financial, and Registrar. TRANSCRIPTS Official copies of your Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai transcript can be requested when a stamped and sealed copy of your academic record is required.

Payment may be made by personal check, bank draft, wire transfer or money order, drawn to the order of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. If a student is not receiving financial aid then his/her tuition and fees must be paid upon receipt of their billing invoice, no later than two weeks after the first day of classes. . Domestic Students - Tuition Management System (TMS) payment plan and affordability counseling portal . For information, call 800- 356-8329 or visit the website. International Students - Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has partnered with PayMyTuition for international tuition payments. With PayMyTuition, you can pay your tuition payments from any bank, in any country, in any currency at b etter than bank exchange rates. PayMyTuition is fast, simple and cost effective. The Board of Trustees reserves the right to revise tuition and fees each academic year. All financial obligations m ust be cleared prior to the completion of each academic term. Students who have not cleared their account by the due date will not be allowed to register for upcoming terms, receive a transcript or letter of recommendation, have academic credits certified, receive a leave of absence, receive other student services, attend class/clerkship for the current academic ter m, or have a degree conferred. Late fees of $100 will be charged on balances, if deemed delinquent. Unpaid balances will be turned over to an outside collection agency at the end of each academic year. Tuition Refund Policy Students who withdraw from the Institution or from a course during an academic term will receive a tuition refund based on the below institutional schedule. Tuition refunds will be calculated based on the date the student submits their withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office. Withdrawal through the first calendar week of the term 100 percent of Tuition Only Second calendar week of the term 75 percent of Tuition Only Third calendar week of the term 50 percent of Tuition Only Fourth calendar week of the te rm 25 percent of Tuition Only After the Fourth week of the term No Refund For students receiving federal financial aid processed through the Office of S tudent Financial Services, be advised that all funds from federal Title IV programs will be returned to the government according to federal regulations. Returned funds previously credited towards tuition will leave an outstanding balance that students are personally responsible for paying. Students are advised to understand the 49 above tuition schedule as withdrawing after the first week of class creates a financial obligation which, if not cleared by the end of the academic year, will be referred to an outsi de collection agency. No refunds will be granted to students dismissed or suspended. The Institution reserves the right to dismiss a student whose academic standing or general conduct is considered unsatisfactory. Repetition of Coursework Student s may r etake a course with permission of the Academic Program Office. A student who has earned credit for a course may repeat it once upon approval , but will not receive additional academic credit. A student permitted to repeat a course must pay full tuition and other regular fees in effect at the time of the repetition. Students cannot receive financial aid to cover the tuition for retaking a course. FINANCIAL AID General Financial Aid Policy The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai consistently provides as much financial assistance as possible to eligible students who are in good academic standing, maintain satisfactory academic progress, meet filing deadlines and require financial assistance in order to attend the School. Admission to ISMM S is completely i ndependent of financial requirements. Financial aid decisions are made on the basis of documented need without discrimination due to age, race, color, language, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic disposition, ethnicit y, culture, creed, national origin, citizenship physical or mental disability, socioeconomic status, veteran status, military status, marital status, being the victim of spousal abuse, or based on any other characteristic protected by law. Financial Aid Application Degree seeking students who are interested in applying for Federal Stafford loans to cover the cost of tuition and direct expense can supply FAFSA data on the Web at www.fafsa.ed.gov . Reapplication is required annual ly for all loan and scholarship recipients. Determination of Need The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai utilizes the standard federal formula for determining financial aid eligibility. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai reser ves the right to reconsider its offer and commitments of financial assistance in the event of a financial award made from an outside source. (Required adjustments will be applied to the loan portion of the financial aid package wherever possible.) All Cost of Attendance Budgets cover the student only. Federal law prohibits using federal funds for the support of anyone other than the student. Required Entrance Counseling As part of their financial aid package, all students requesting student loans must complete online entrance counseling on the website studentloans.gov. This requirement is imposed by the Department of Education as a form of financial literacy for first -time borrowers. This counselling will cover loan basics, type of federal student loans and loan limits. Students will have a clear understanding of their rights and responsibilities at the completion of online entrance counseling. 50 Required Exit Counseling Student loan borrowers are required to complete exit counseling prior to separating from Icahn School of Medicine. Students who have been issued loans from the Icahn School of Medicine (Perkins, Mount Sinai Loan.) Stude nts must complete online exit counseling on mycampusloan.com. Direct Loan borrowers must complete online exit counseli ng on studentloans.gov. Each exit counseling will provide loan balances; terms of repayment, deferment and forbearance options available to borrowers. Students must complete all required exit counseling prior to being cleared for graduation. Debt Management and Counseling Throughout the student's education the Office of Student Financial Services is available to discuss indebtedness, career choices, and money management issues. Graduating students should be aware of the requirements of the various ext ernal student loan programs in which they may have participated. It is important to maintain contact with Icahn School of Medicine and the appropriate lending institutions to understand the terms of each loan program, and to plan for repayment. Timely loan repayments are essential in establishing a good cr edit rating. The extent that loan indebtedness will impact future expense budgeting can be considerable. In order to assist students in tracking loans, interest rates and various conditions of the loans, t he Program suggests consulting online debt - management information . https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action http://www.finaid.org/ http://gradsense.org/gradsense http://www.aspph.org/study/financing -your-degree/ Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Federal regulations require that students receiving federal aid make satisfactory academic progress (SAP). Satisfactory Academic Progress refers to the satisfactory completion of courses, Applied Practice Experience ( Practicum ), and Culminating Experience requirements accor ding to established increments that lead to awarding the degree within published time limits . Please s ee the definition of Satisfactory Academic Progress in the Graduate Program in Public Health . Failure to Meet the Requirements for SAP - A student who fa ils to meet one or more of the standards for SAP is ineligible for financial aid beginning with the term immediately following the term in which the SAP requirements were not met. Appeals - Students who do not meet the minimum standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress may appeal to an ad hoc committee comprised of representatives from Enrollment Services and the Academic Program for reinstatement of financial aid eligibility. The appeal must first be submitted in writing to the Associate Dean for Enrol lment Services within 10 days of notification of ineligibility. The appeal must include what has changed in the student's situation that will allow him or her to meet the requirements for SAP at the next evaluation. Circumstances which may be considered as a basis for an appeal may include family emergency, death in the student's immediate family, a student's medical illness or injury, or other undue hardships. If the committee determines that the student's appeal should be approved, the student's financial aid will be reinstated. Financial Aid Probation - Once an appeal has been approved, a student is placed on financial aid probation and is eligible for financial aid. The Academic Program, and in some cases the Academic Advisory Committee, will develop an academic plan for the student that will ensure, if followed, that the student is able to meet SAP standards. A student shall become eligible again for financial aid when 51 he or she has successfully completed sufficient coursework to meet the standards of progress within the maximum time frames delineated above. Loss of Financial Aid Eligibility - A student who does not meet the SAP requirements by the end of the financial aid probationary period is ineligible for financial aid. The loss of financial aid e ligibility will continue until the student has met both the qualitative and quantitative standards established for their level of study. Length of Time to Complete Degree for Financial Aid A student will be permitted a maximum time limit to complete a de gree: Degree Normal Length (Years) Maximum Time to Complete Degree (Years) MPH 2 5 Dual Degree with MPH 5 7 MS in Epidemiology 1 3 Advanced Certificate 1 2 These time limits include any time for personal or medical L eave of A bsence . In the Graduat e Program in Public Health, benchmarks of satisfactory progress must be completed as outlined in the specific program requirements. Students who are approaching the time limit for completion will be reviewed with enough notice so that a plan is in place to enable the student to complete the req uirements by the end of the time limit. Please see the full Length of Time to Complete Degree Policy on page 5 9. 52 COURSE AND GRADING POLICIES COURSE REGISTRATION & ENROLLMENT Students enroll for courses on the student information system: student.mssm.edu The Late Registration (Add/Drop) Deadline is the final date for students to make changes to their selection of classes.

Course Cancellation Please note that if fewer than five students enroll in a particular course, the course will be subject to cancellation. In the case that the course is cancelled, the student will be allowed to register for an other course. NON-MATRICULATING STATUS AND COURSE AUDITING Non -matriculating Status Individuals interested in registering courses in the Graduate Program in Public Health without pursing a degree program, may complete an application on SOPHAS Express for non-matriculated student and paying the application fee. Students will be billed for the appropriate amount of tuition and will be entitled to receive a transcript. The number of course credits that a non- matriculated student can take from offerings i n the Graduate Program in Public Health will be limited to a total of 12 credits. 53 Official Audits A full -time matriculated student may request to officially audit a course by contacting the Registrar's Office prior to the end of the A dd/D rop period. Students auditing a course usually do not write examinations or papers and do not necessarily participate in class discussions. However, auditors should clarify expectations at the start of the course with the Course Director . An audited course will appear on the student's transcript with the designation \"AU\". No academic credit is awarded and the course can not be counted for determining full -time status for international students or financial aid status. Non-matriculated students, including employees, who wish to audit a course and have the audited course appear on a transcript as \"AU\" will be billed at the same rate as for courses taken for credit. Unofficial Audits Unofficial auditing is rarely allowed . In these instances, students may unofficially audit with permission of the course director. No tuition will be charged and a transcript will not be provided. GRADES Grades awarded in the Program are A, A -, B+, B, B -, C+, C, C -, or F. Pass- Fail grades are permitted only for certain electives and ar e not used to calculate a student's grade point average (GPA). Course Evaluations and Grade Release The Program uses Blackboard to collect student course evaluations. Grades will not be distributed until the course evaluation has been completed. Before the end of every term the Academic Program Office will post the Course Evaluation on the blackboard course sites. If the Course Director had outside speakers address the class during the term, this information will be evaluated on the same Course Evaluatio n. Evaluations are confidential and important tools for course development. Calculation of GPA In calculating the GPA, all credits with the following grades are counted in the total used to compute the grade point average/cumulative index: A, A-, B+, B, B- , C+, C, C -, or F. To compute the grade point average, follow the steps below: Grade Quality Point Value A 4.00 A- 3.70 B+ 3.30 B 3.00 B- 2.70 C+ 2.30 C 2.00 54 1. Determine the total number of credits completed by adding up al l the credits with letter grades. This total must include any credits with \"F\" grades. 2. For each course with a letter grade, which counts toward the GPA, multiply the number of credits by the appropriate quality point value, as indicated below: 3. Add the quality point values for all the courses to determine the total quality points. 4. Divide the total quality points by the total number of credits (as computed in Step 1). 5. The resulting figure is the grade point average/cumulative index. Please not e that the index is computed to two decimal points and the index is not rounded off. Credits with grades of Pass (P), Satisfactory Progress (SP), or Satisfactorily Completed (SC) do not figure into the computation of the grade point average but do count t oward the degree. Transfer credits count toward the degree but do not figure into the index. Credits for undergraduate courses are neither counted toward the degree nor computed into the average. Incomplete Grades Students are expected to take exams whe n they are scheduled and submit assignments on time. Under extraordinary circumstances (such as a medical emergency), a temporary grade of Incomplete (I) may be considered for a student who is unable to complete course requirements . To receive an incomple te grade, the student must make a formal request using the Incomplete Grade Request Form. The form must be signed by both the student and the Course Director and submitted to the Academic Program Office . The request will include the reason for the incomple te, the work yet to be completed, and the final date by whi ch the work is to be completed. Final approval will be given by the Registrar. Students have two academic terms to remediate an incomplete, after which time the incomplete is converted to a failing grade (F). Retaking Courses Students seeking to improve their grade point average (GPA) may re take a course, with permission from the Academic Program Office. If a course is retaken, the original grade remains on the transcript but only the second (ret ake) grade will be counted in the determination of the student's GPA. A student who has earned credit for a course may repeat it once, but will not receive additional credit. Students cannot receive financial aid to cover the tuition for retaking a course . Failures A student who fail s a course may repeat the course one time. A grade of C or better in the repeated course is required to maintain matriculation in the program. Students who fail the same course more than once will be automatically withdrawn f rom the program. C- 1.70 F 0.00 55 Grade Appeals Process A student has one (1) month from the date of receiving a course grade to make an appeal. The grade may be amended in either direction. Students must bring all course grade appeals to the course director. If there is still a discrepancy after the meeting of the course director and the student, the student should present the issue in writing to the Academic Program Office who will then bring the matter to the attention of Chair of the Academic Advisory Committee. Inf ormation for the appeal should be solicited from both the student and the course director. In some cases, at the discretion of the Chair of the Academic Advisory Committee, it may be appropriate to hold a meeting during which the student must state the app eal to the Committee. The Committee will investigate the issue and present its finding(s) to the Program Director for a final decision. The Chair of the Academic Advisory Committee will inform the student of the decision. ELECTIVES AT ISMMS AND ELSEWHERE Students are permitted to take any course offered by the Graduate Program in Public Health . These may be considered general electives, not substituting any track -specifically or degree -specific requirements . Please see the Curriculum Guide for a complete list of course offerings and pre - requisites. If a student wishes to take a course in a different degree program at ISMMS, an Elective Approval Request Form must be submitted and approved by the Academic Program Office prior to registering for the course . Without the necessary approval, the elective course may not be counted toward the credits required for a degree program . This is to ensure that the course meets the objectives of the Graduate Program in Public Health before a student make a time commitme nt or financial commitment to another Program or Institution. Approval, when granted, is conditional upon student completing all of the course requirements and earning a B or better grade . The student must then follow the procedures for transferring credit s and/or course waiv er to apply the elective to their degree program . If a student is interested in enrolling in a course offered by another academic institution , a student must seek approval from the Academic Program Office. Please submit a course descri ption and a syllabus from the Institut ion offering the elective course and an Elective Approval Request to the Academic Program Office . Approval must be given from the Graduate Program in Public Health prior to enrolling in a course in another Institution. Without the necessary approval, the student may not be eligible to transfer credits or course waiver s. Approval, when granted, is conditional upon student completing all of the course requirements and earning a B or better grade . The student must follow t he trans fer credit or course waiver procedure to apply the elective to the degree program . INDEPENDENT STUDY An Independent Study is an elective option providing the student with an opportunity to delve more thoroughly into an area of public health that is of specific interest to them. An Independent Study must be a unique experience and must involve mentorship from an ISMMS Faculty Sponsor . Material covered during an independent study project should be highly targeted and not simply a review of the regularly offered coursework. Each student may complete no more than two independent study projects. 56 An Independent Study Proposal must be submitted at least six weeks prior to the anticipated start of the proposed project/course of study. This is to ensure t hat the goals meet the overall objectives of the Graduate Program in Public Health before a student commits any time and energy. An Independent Study Proposal submitted less than six weeks of the anticipated start of the project/course of study may not be approved and the student is responsible for assuming any risk that this may entail. Approval, when granted, is conditional upon the student completing all of the outlined requirements. The student must submit a Postscript Report and request that the ISMMS Faculty Sponsor complete the Independe nt Study Evaluation Form. Final credits are awarded at the end of the project by approval of the Academic Program Office . An Independent Study can be valued at one, two, or three credits. Each credit represents approximately 45 hours of work. Three credits are the maximum number of credits that may be awarded to any Independent Study. Please note that while the total hours committed to the pursuit of the Independent Study may be sufficient for more than three credits or more than one elective, students will not receive any more than three credits for one project/course of study. Eligibility Students with more than one outstanding Incomplete at the time of the proposal submission may not be eligible to complete an I ndependent Study. Restrictions It is important to note that independent study projects should not be attempts to take courses that are offered by the Graduate Program in Public Health routinely during the academic year at times that are more convenient for the student. Independent study projects cannot exempt students from core course requirements. Steps towards formalizing an Independent Study 1. Identify and meet with your ISMMS Faculty Sponsor to propose the Independent Study. 2. Complete the Independen t Study Proposal Form. 3. Submit the Inde pendent Study Form to the Academic Program Office for approval. 4. Once approved, complete the project/course of study. 5. Complete the Independent Study Postscript Report. 6. Request that your Faculty Sponsor review the P ostscript Report and complete the Independent Study Evaluation Form. 7. Submit completed Pos tscript Report and Ev aluation form to the Academic Program Office . TRANSFERRING CREDITS Within specific guidelines, students in the Graduate Program in Public Heal th may apply for transfer credit for graduate -level courses or waiver of a specific degree requirement based on coursework taken outside the Program . The Transfer Credit and Course Waiver policy applies to courses taken in other programs within ISMMS and a t external institutions . All requests for transfer credit will be considered on an individual basis by the Graduate Program in Public Health Academic Program Office . Students ma y transfer a maximum of ten (10 ) whole course credits that meet specific crite ria, as outlined in the following section. Credits for a course may not be split; the course credit is granted for 57 whole courses. Grades assigned to transfer credits will not be included in the calculation of the student's grade point average (GPA) at ISMM S. Current students must have courses preapproved through the Graduate Program in Public Health . Please be aware that other institutions may award credits in a manner not consistent with ISMMS credit policy. Students should not expect in every case to rec eive the exact number of credits given at another institution. Credits awarded for courses taken elsewhere are decided after review of the syllabus and on a case -by-case basis by the Academic Program Office . As part of the preapproval process, students are informed of the number of credits they may be awarded; therefore, it is vital that the student apply for preapproval. All courses for anticipated transfer credit must meet the following criteria: Courses must be officially documented as graduate -level co urses. Transfer credit is contingent upon completion of the course with a B (3.0) or better at an institution of established academic reputation. Courses taken on a pass/fail basis may be used for transfer credit; provided the student provides proof (a let ter from the course director or Program Director) that a grade of B or better would have been given. Decisions regarding transfer credits are not made prior to matriculation. Official transcripts documenting the final grade(s) must be sent to the Graduate Program in Public Health. Courses cannot have been used in the past or be used in the future toward another degree program. Courses must be taken at an accredited US institution or an institution accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (C EPH). Courses must have significant, direct public health content. For example, foreign language courses would not be considered for transfer credit for the MPH degree, nor would an organic chemistry course. Courses taken prior to matriculation must meet t he above criteria, must have been taken, at a maximum, within the past five (5) years, and must not have been used toward the completion of another degree program. It is possible that completed courses may not be approved because the content in the field has changed. Current s tudents may petition to transfer select courses taken at other CEPH -accredited graduate - level institutions. Students may be exempt from taking required courses in the Graduate Program in Public Health on the basis of having successful ly taken equivalent courses elsewhere. Equivalent courses may be determined by alignment with CEPH Foundational Competencies and the learning objectives outlined by the CEPH Foundational Public Health Knowledge areas. COURSE WAIVER Current students may petition t o be waived from requirements based on previous coursework , specifically taken at CEPH -accredited graduate -level institutions. Students seeking to waive degree requirements must request the waiver 6 weeks in advance of the term that the course in question is offered. Students may be asked to demonstrate proficiency in addition to demonstrating course equivalency. Equivalent courses may be determined by alignment with CEPH Foundational Competencies and the learning objectives outlined by the CEPH F oundational Public Health Knowledge areas. 58 Relevant courses must have been taken within the past five years. It is possible that completed courses taken within five years may not be approved because the content in the field has changed. The decision to g rant a waiver is at the discretion of the faculty or Program representative. In the case of a course waiver, the student will not receive credit towards the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Master of Publ ic Health degree. The exemption from taking our required course will free the student to take an elective course in order to achieve the necessary number of credits required for the degree program. Students should contact the Academic Program Office for the Course Exemption Form. ATTENDANCE , MATRICULATION , LEAVE OF ABSENCE , AND RELATED POLICIES ATTENDANCE STANDARDS Active participation in the Graduate Program in Public Health courses and activities is a critical component of the professional development of all students. Lack of attendance for a ny reason does not relieve a student from responsibility for material covered during that absence. Students should refer to the Academic Calendar for the Graduate Program in Public Health when planning any travel. Students should notify the Academic Program Office about any anticipated or sudden absence from a required activity (e.g., Public Health Research Day). Students should adhere to the attendance and absence policies outlined in each course syllabus. Timely attendance is an expectation of performanc e for all Graduate Program in Public Health students . This shows respect for peers, faculty, staff , and other community members . Students will be held accountable for adhering to their course schedul e and the lateness policies outlined in each course syllabus. MATRICULATION POLICY Once matriculated in the degree program offerings of the Graduate Program in Public Health at ISMMS, students are expected to maintain matriculation or request an alternative status (e.g., leave of absence, voluntary withdrawal, etc.), or may be placed in an alternate status by the Academic Program Office and Program Director (e.g., administrative withdrawal, etc.). To maintain matriculation, students must either register for at least one credit -bearing course or register for MPH 8001 Maintenance of Matriculation for every term up until degree conferral. The Maintenance of Matriculation registration allows students continued eligibility to earn their degree while not pursuing coursework . Students on Maintenance of Matriculation will not be eligible for financial aid. The MPH 8001 Maintenance of Matriculation registration is $333 per term for students in trimester programs. Students with compelling circumstance who wish not to maintain their matriculation status but need to discontinue their studies for a period of time can apply for a Leave of Absence (LOA) from the program. Students who fail to register for a term or receive an approved LOA, will be administratively withdrawn from the Program, and will have to re -apply in order to continue their degree or certificate studies. 59 LENGTH OF TIME TO COMPLETE DEGREE The Graduate Program in Public Health is a dynamic, cutting edge public health program, and as such, the course work for the degree programs offered are designed to be completed in a full -time manner (two-year MPH program , one -year MS in Epidemiology program) . Students are permitted to take courses on a part time basis. However, t he MPH degree must be completed within five years of the student's first matriculation date, i ncluding the completion of the Culminating Experience. The MS in Epidemiology degree must be completed within 3 years of the student's first matriculation date, including the completion of the Thesis or Manuscript. Advanced Certificate students have a maxi mum of two years to complete the Advanced Certificate. Dual Degree MPH students have a maximum time to degree completion of seven years for the MPH degree. Students who do not complete the degree or certificate within this specified time frame will be with drawn from the program. A student will be permitted a maximum time limit to complete a degree: Degree Length as Designed (Years) Maximum Time to Complete Degree (Years) MPH 2 5 Dual Degree with MPH 5 7 MS in Epidemiology 1 3 Advanced Certificate 1 2 These time limits include any time for personal or medical leave of absence . In the Graduate Program in Public Health, benchmarks of satisfactory progress must be completed as outlined in the specific program requirements. Students who are approaching t he time limit for completion will be reviewed with enough notice so that a plan is in place to enable the student to complete the requirements by the end of the time limit. If a student does not complete their degree within the Time to Compete Degree, it is the responsibility of the student to contact the Academic Program Office to discuss their plan to complete their degr ee. As students approach their maximum T ime to Complete Degree they will be reminded of the Length of Time to Complete Degree policy. Th e student will be placed on a registration hold, and required to meet with the Academic Program Office to ensure that the degree is completed by the end of their maximum Time to Complete Degree. Students who do not complete their degree within the required time frame are administratively withdrawn from the program. Under extenuating circumstances an extension of the Maximum Time to Complete Degree may be granted by the Academic Program Office and Program Director . If a student's appeal for an extension is denied, the student may not reapply to the program. Validity of Coursework Program Competencies and course content change over time. Course credit awarded within a student's maximum Time to Complete Degree will be honored and count toward the credits r equired for the degree . However, course credit awarded outside of the m aximum Time to Complete Degree 60 specified for the degree may be assessed on a case by case basis to determine the relevance of course material to contemporary topics in the field of publ ic health . Credit earned in courses that are considered no longer valid by the Academic Program Office will not count toward the degree or Advanced Certificate requirements. LEAVE OF ABSENCE Students may face situations where they have to balance the demands of graduate school with major life events or personal circumstances that also require attention, care and energy. These situations include the birth or adoption of a child, a major personal illness, or an illness of a loved one. How to balance per sonal demands and academics requires careful consideration and planning. The Graduate Program in Public Health is committed to engaging with students to create viable approaches to situations as needs arise. It is essential that students be open and proact ive in these discussions, and the Graduate Program in Public Health will likewise strive to be fair and transparent. Any modified educational plans must involve discussion with and approval from the Academic Program Office . Plans may require input from Enr ollment Services and Financial Aid, as well as from course directors when relevant. At times, l ife circumstances may require students to take time away from courses or ISMMS . In these cases, a student may be eligible to t ake a leave of absence until they can more fully engage in the curriculum. A Leave of Absence ( LOA ) is a period of temporary non- enrollment. A LOA constitutes a mutual agr eement between the School and a student with regard to utilization of time during the leave, as well as the requiremen ts that must be met prior to reentering the curriculum. All requests for a LOA are made directly to and granted at the discretion of the Academic Program Office. LOA approval can only be obtained if the student maintains satisfactory academic progress ( SAP as defined on page 43). Students who fail to follow the Leave of Absence procedure will be administratively withdrawn from the Program. If the student wishes to return at a later date, they must apply for admission. International students should consult with the Office of International Personnel to discuss their eligibility for a Leave of Absence. LOAs may be Medical, Personal, or Administrative. Medical LOA Either the student or Academic Program Office may initiate a medical LOA. A medical LOA may require a physician's endorsement and/or an administrative psychiatric or medical evaluation (see page 77). The term of the Leave may be up to one year. The L eave may be extended for a second and final year at the discretion of the Academic Program Office an d Program Director upon recommendation of a physician. All students on medical LOA are required to have health insurance and are eligible to continue with the School's student health insurance plan. Personal LOA A personal LOA enables a student to take t ime off to address issues of a personal nature, including those related to the health and well -being of a family member or partner. A LOA may also be granted for issues related to childbirth, adoption, or other parental responsibilities. Personal leaves f or non- health or non- family related circumstances may not be taken at any time when the student is not in good academic standing. 61 Ordinarily, personal leaves may not exceed one year; however, requests to extend a personal leave into a second and final yea r will be considered under exceptional circumstances. All students on personal LOA are required to have health insurance and are eligible to continue on the School's student health insurance plan. Administrative LOA A LOA can also be administrative. An Administrative LOA is mandated by the Graduate School at ISMMS and Program Director and is usually as the result of a student not complying with school's administrative requirements. Documentation of LOAs The dates for all LOAs will be noted on the Transcript. The reason for the LOA will not be included in these documents, with the exception of an Administrative LOA, which will be desig nated as such on the transcript . Financial Implications of LOA To be eligible to receive federal and institutional stu dent aid, the student must meet and maintain the School's standards of satisfactory academic progress. (Please refer to the section entitled \"Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid\" page 42 .) A Leave of Absence status greater than 180 days will move students out of their loan deferment period. The last date of attendance before the LOA is the \"Out of School\" date. After 180 days, the grace period ends and all educational federal loans will go into repa yment. Students are expected to meet with the Office of Enrollment Services before a LOA is finalized in order to fully understand the consequences of the LOA on loan repayment. Additional Information Students on a Leave of Absence are not eligible f or any benefits associated with student status , such as a travel award for the duration of the L eave. While on LOA a student will hav e library privileges suspended. Students on LOA may not participate in any educational opportunities at the Icahn School of Medicine for credit. A student who resides in Ar on Hall may be required to vacate Aron Hall while on LOA, based on the nature and anticipated length of the LOA. Requests for an extension of a L eave of A bsence must follow the sam e procedure as indicated above. The period of an approve LOA is included in a student's Time to Complete Degree . A student who was on an approved LOA may request an extension of the Time to Complete Degree. Clearance to Begin Leaves of Absence, Withdraw, Transfer, or Otherwise Leave The School Students who go on a LOA must obtain clearance beforehand from the Academic Program Office and Program Director. The st udent will receive a letter of l eave and individualized conditions will apply. All students must meet the criteria and confirm agreement with the terms of the leave in w riting. In addition, students must complete a form requiring the signatures of the requisite offices indicating 62 that there are no outstanding debts or other encumbrances to the student's rec ord. When all the signatures are obtained, the student must ret urn the form to the Registrar's Office. There is a processing fee of $100.00 for leaves. Please contact the Academic Program Office for the appropriate forms. Return from LOA The Program Leadership approves students for return from a LOA. The point person for the return process is the Academic Program Office . Students should refer to the individualized terms of their leave letter and must complete all required evaluations or testing prior to return. In general return from a medical leave of absence requir es a physician's note that the student is cleared to return to school. At the end of a specified period of LOA, if the student does not notify the Academic Program Office of their intentions, it will be assumed the student no longer wishes to be considered enrolled and will be administratively withdrawn . If a student wishes to apply for reinstatement at a later date, a new application for admission must be completed. STUDENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE GRADUATE PROGRAM IN PUBLIC HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH DAY Public Health Research Day, held annually by the Graduate Program in Public Health, is a required event for all Master -level students. All graduating students are required to present posters during the Public Health Research Day . All other students are required to attend the day's events. In addition to the annual poster session, the event include s a keynote lecture, oral presentations, and a networking reception. This is an excellent opportunity for networking among students, faculty, alumni, and commun ity stakeholders, and to gain experience in presenting your work to an audience with diverse professional interests. All graduating students are encouraged to prepare in advance for Public Health Research Day. The abstract for Public Health Research Day will be due in early April, and the poster will be due in early May. The Public Health Research Day Committee will select the top -ranked abstracts for oral presentations, and each will receive a Blue Ribbon Award with an honorarium. GLOBAL HEALTH SUMME R EXPERIENCE The Global Health Summer Experience is a competitive fieldwork opportunity where MPH students travel to one of our project sites around the world to gain hands -on experience working in a global health setting. Under the guidance of an ISMMS faculty advisor and an on- site mentor, students tackle some of the most challenging public health issues facing our world today. The application for the Global Health Summer Experience opens in the Fall Term, following a Global Health Summer Information Session. MPH s tudents in all specialt y tracks are welcome to apply. MPH students who participate in the Global Health Summer Experience with the Graduate Program in Public Health may use this experience to fulfill the APE requirement. 63 Students receive a stipend to assist with the cost of travel and accommodations. Students are responsible for all other expenses. In preparation for travel, students may be required to register for or participate in a Preparation for Global Health Fieldwork course/training , and complete various other requirements related to the Global Health Summer Experience . Students will be expected to adhere to all academic and travel, health and safety requirements. Should any unforeseeable circumstances significantly affect the projec t site, travel, or other components of the experience, students should engage directly with the Graduate Program in Public Health for guidance. CONFERENCE AWARDS FOR PARTICIPATION OR TRAVEL Students are encouraged to submit a Conference Award Application to the Graduate Program in Public Health to help contribute funding toward conference presentations . Students in good academic standing are eligible to apply. The Conference Award Application is a competitive process. Awards will range from $100 to a maximum of $600. If approved for a Conference Award, students will receive funds after the conference and/or travel takes place and receipts have been submitted . Conference Awards are not meant to reimburse the student for all costs associated with the confere nce. We hope that the Conference Award will help assist students in covering the cost of attending conferences so that they can take advantage of these great networking and career development opportunities. The Conference Award application can be found on Blackboard. It is the student's responsibility to submit relevant information to be considered by the Committee (minimum: application, abstract, confirmation of conference acceptance) . We determine the award amount by considering authorship level, type of presentation, and relevance of the work to public health. Incomplete applications will not be considered for funding and will be returned to the student following the notification date. Not all Conference Award Applications are approved. The most competit ive applications are those in which the student is the first author and the presentation demonstrates excellence and innovation in the field of public health. The program will review and make recommendations based o n the merit of the application. Each st udent may be approved for up to one award per calendar year with a limit of two travel awards during the student's time in the program. The award is only applicable for travel taking place while the student maintains their student status and is in good aca demic standing in the School. There are four deadlines for submission of applications each year. The Graduate Program in Public Health reserves the right to change this schedule. All students and faculty will be notified of such changes, via e-mail, prior to the effective dates of such changes. Applications that do not follow this schedule will only be considered un der extenuating circumstances. Failure to submit all required paperwork in accordance with these established deadlines would void the award. Travel Period Application Submission Award Notification September 1 to October 31 July 15 August 1 November 1 to February 28 September 15 October 1 March 1 to May 31 January 15 February 1 June 1 to August 31 April 15 May 1 64 TEACHING ASSISTANTSHIP S Many courses in the graduate school offer teaching assistantships to qualified students. The TA works under the guidance and supervision of the C ourse Director and duties will vary from course to course. Teaching assistantship activities may include re cording of lectures, discussion- group leadership, holding review sessions, tutoring of students in course work, laboratory preparation, supervision, and cleanup and assisting in the preparation and grading of problem sets and/or examinations. The course director and student would work out the specifics of the assistantship together, and will vary from course to course. The TA experience will require careful planning and monitoring to ensure that the TA, the students, and the course director benefit from the relationship. Course Directors are encouraged to provide feedback and mentoring to the TA on an ongoing basis. Students may receive a stipend for being a teaching assistant. Only students in good academic standing may be a TA. A TA Appointment Form must be completed with the instructor's signature before the student can serve as a TA. Within 2 weeks of TA appointment ending, the Course Directors must submit their evaluation of TA performance. RESEARCH ASSISTANTSHIPS Faculty at Mount Sinai may have positions for students to work as Research Assistants on their current projects. These may be volunteer opportunities, or opportunities funded through research grants, internship programs, or other sources. Students are encouraged to seek these opportunities by expressing interest in a faculty person's current projects, asking if a Research Assistant opportunity is available and if they might be considered for the position. The Graduate Program in Public Health offers a limited number of research assistant positions funded through the federal work -study program . In order to be eligible for these positions, a student must be deemed eligible for federal financial aid based on the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) and the Office of Student Financial Services designations . Faculty and students are encouraged to contact the Academic Program Office for questions about the eligibility and availability of research assistantships. Faculty may identify an eligible student to serve as a Research Assistant, or may ask the Academic Program Office to advertise this opportunity through the email list.

Student/Trainee Mental Health Service All students and trainees have access to confidential mental health services through Student Trainee Mental Health. Services cover a wide range of mental health issues including consultation, psychotherapy and counseling, medication management, and referr als. Students and trainees most commonly seek treatment for adjustment difficulties, burn- out, depression, anxiety, and attentional symptoms. Treatment through Student Trainee Mental Health will not incur a bill to the student regardless of his/her insura nce plan. For students seeking long -term services, or for those who would prefer to see a provider outside of Mount Sinai, Student Trainee Mental Health will perform initial assessments and provide referrals from a multi -disciplinary base. Any treatment outside of Student Trainee Mental Health will require payment according to the student's insurance plan or a fee negotiated with the outside provider. Services through Student Trainee Mental Health are treated with the same level of confidentiality as requi red for all patients by New York State Law. Confidentiality is strictly and carefully protected, and any personal medical or psychiatric information will not be released without clear and written consent from the student/trainee. The only instance in which confidentiality can be broken is if a student/trainee is believed to be a danger to himself/herself or to someone else. Students may request an initial appointment with Student Trainee Mental Health by calling 212 -659- 8805, through the online scheduling system in MARC , or by sending an email to STMH@mssm.edu . In order to increase your ability to attend clinical appointments, the STMH program has expanded t he service to include evening hours multiple days each week. 67 For emergency psychiatric services, contact the psychiatrist on -call through the page operator at 212-241-5581, call the Psychiatric Emergency Service at 212- 241-5637, or go to the Emergency Room.

At ISMMS: Diversity embodies inclusiveness and values multiple perspectives. Diversity embraces and celebrates intersectional social identities including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, gender identi ty, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, language, nationality, religion, geographic location, disability status, and age. Inclusion fosters belonging, \"connectedness,\" respect and value for all. Inclusion considers differences in ideas, thoughts, opinions, experiences, beliefs and practices in all discussions and decision- making. Equity is the experience of freedom from bias or favoritism, where everyone has the opportunity to attain their full potential and no one is disadvantaged or favored due to social position or other socially -determined circumstances. We believe diversity, inclusion and equity are imperative to achieving excellence in all our missions create an environment of respect and affirmation of intersecting social identities and liv ed experiences allow our community of learners, educators, providers and investigators to use medicine, science, and policy as platforms for advocacy and social justice We are committed to increasing and sustaining the representation of individuals unde rrepresented in medicine and science. We will focus our recruitment and retention efforts on students, residents and trainees, faculty, and staff who identify as Black, Latino/a, educationally and economically disadvantaged, and women. We will also be inte ntional in our efforts to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for all LGBTQ identified students, faculty, residents and trainees, staff, and patients. As individuals pursuing careers, or working in, medicine and science, we have the obligation to be agents of change. We are committed to providing an authentic and intentionally diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment for all patients, students, residents and trainees, staff and faculty. Our goal is to be a health system that is free from racism and bias, in which health care is a human right and is accessible to all.

The administration and faculty of the School are committed to providing a safe and healthy learning environment for all students. Students should c onduct themselves appropriately everywhere on the campus of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Mount Sinai Health System, and at affiliated institutions. Appropriate behavior is mandatory when participating in patient care or attending any functions at which patients may be present. In small group seminars, as well as during clinical activities, students are evaluated not only on their fund of knowledge and ability to use this knowledge but also on their responsibility, dependability, reliability, mat urity, motivation, attitude, honesty, integrity, and ability to relate and interact effectively with others. i. Equally important is the realization that one's responsibilities do not end with individual behavior but also include not tolerating inappropriate behavior among others. While formal mechanisms, outlined in other sections, exist to provide due process for any specific allegations of inappropriate behavior, general issues should be able to be discussed freely among peers, faculty, and administration. Concerns requiring confidentiality should be discussed with the Dean of Medical Education, Dean of the Graduate School, individual faculty advisors, or through the School's Ombudsman Program. MISCONDUCT AND LAPSES IN PROFESSIONALISM Student misconduct includes, but is not limited to: cheating, plagiarism, breaches of confidentiality, falsification, unprofessional behavior toward staff, colleagues, and community members, use and abuse of illicit drugs, abuse or inappropriate use of alcohol, dishonesty, and failure to complete administrative, medical, and financial responsibilities. Administrative responsibilities include course evaluati ons, student health clearances , and other training as applicable . AFFIRMATIVE ACTION It is the policy of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai to make all decisions regarding educational and employment opportunities and performance on the basis of merit and without discrimination because of age, race, color, language, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic disposition, ethnicity, culture, creed, national origin, citizenship physical or mental disability, socioeconomic status, veteran status, military status, marital status, being the victim of spousal abuse, or based on any other chara cteristic protected by law. In keeping with our continuing efforts to achieve a broadening of the representation of women and minority groups throughout the medical school, we have: A. Developed an Affirmative Action Program that details actions designe d to realize the School's commitment to equal educational and employment opportunities. 82 B. Insured our compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations implementing equal opportunity objectives by meeting the spirit as well as the letter of the law and contractual requirements. We cannot over -emphasize our commitment to realizing these goals. Every decision affecting faculty, house staff, fellows, graduate students, employees, medical students, and other members of the medical school community rests solely on demonstrably valid criteria of merit, competence, and experience. You can find additional information concerning the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai's Affirmative Action Program through the Human Resources Department of the Mount Sinai Health System. MOUNT SINAI HEALTH SYSTEM SOCIAL MEDIA GUIDELINE Social media are internet -based applications which support and promote the exchange of user - developed content. Some current examples include Facebook, Wikipedia, and YouTube. Posting personal images, experiences and information on these kinds of public sites poses a set of unique challenges for all members of the Mount Sinai community, including employees, faculty, house staff, fellows, volunteers, and students (collectively \"Personnel\"). All personnel have responsibility to the Institution regardless of where or when they post something that may reflect poorly on Mount Sinai. Mount Sinai is committed to supporting your right to interact knowledgeably and socially; however these elect ronic interactions have a potential impact on patients, colleagues, Mount Sinai, and future employers' opinions of you. The principal aim of this Guideline is to identify your responsibilities to Mount Sinai in relation to social media and to help you represent yourself and Mount Sinai in a responsible and professional manner. Guideline The following Guideline outlines appropriate standards of conduct related to all electronic information (text, image or auditory) that is created or posted externally on social media sites by Personnel affiliated with Mount Sinai. Examples include, but are not limited to: text messages, media messaging service (MMS), Twitter\u00ae, Facebook\u00ae, Linked -In\u00ae, YouTube\u00ae, and all other social networks, personal and organizational websites, blogs, wikis, and similar entities. This Guideline applies to future media with similar implications. It also applies whether Personnel are posting to: Mount Sinai- hosted site s; social media in which one's affiliation is known, identified, or presumed; or a self -hosted site, where the views and opinions expressed are not intended to represent the official views of Mount Sinai. Reference to Other Policies - All existing policie s of the Mount Sinai Health System apply to Personnel in connection with their social media activities. A list of relevant policies is included at the end of this Guideline . Best Practices - Everyone who participates in social media activities should unde rstand and follow these simple but important Best Practices: Take Responsibility and Use Good Judgment. You are responsible for the material you post on personal blogs or other social media. Be courteous, respectful, and thoughtful about how other 83 Personnel may perceive or be affected by postings. Incomplete, inaccurate, inappropriate, threatening, harassing or poorly worded postings may be harmful to others. They may damage relationships, undermine Mount Sinai's brand or reputation, discourage teamwork, a nd negatively impact the institution's commitment to patient care, education, research, and community service. Think Before You Post. Anything you post is highly likely to be permanently connected to you and your reputation through Internet and email archives. Future employers can often have access to this information and may use it to evaluate you. Take great care and be thoughtful before placing your identifiable comments in the public domain. Protect Patient Privacy. Disclosing information about patients without written permission, including photographs or potentially identifiable information is strictly prohibited. These rules also apply to deceased patients and to posts in the secure section of your Facebook page that is accessible by approved friends only. Protect Your Own Privacy. Make sure you understand how the privacy policies and security features work on the sites where you are posting material. Respect Work Commitments . Ensure that your blogging, social networking, and other external media activities do not interfere with your work commitments. Identify Yourself. If you communicate in social media about Mount Sinai, disclose your connection with Mount Sinai and your role at the Health System. Use good judgment and strive for accuracy in your communications. False and unsubstantiated claims and inaccurate or inflammatory postings may create liability for you. Use a Disclaimer. Where your connection to Mount Sinai is apparent, make it clear that you are speaking for yourself and not on behalf of Mount Sinai. A disclaimer, such as, \"The views expressed on this [blog; website] are my own and do not reflect the views of my employer,\" may be appropriate. Respect Copyright and Fair Use Laws. For Mount Sinai's protection as well as your own, it is critical that you show proper respect for the laws governing copyri ght and fair use of copyrighted material owned by others, including Mount Sinai's own copyrights and brands. Protect Proprietary Information . Do not share confidential or proprietary informa tion that may compromise Mount Sinai's business practices or security. Similarly, do not share information in violation of any laws or regulations. Seek Expert Guidance. Consult with the Marketing & Communications Department if you have any questions about the appropriateness of materials you plan to publish or if you require clarification on whether specific information has been publicly disclosed before you disclose it publicly. Social media may generate interest from the press. If you are contacted by a member of the media about a Mount Sinai- related blog posting or Health System information of any kind, contact the Press Office, a division of the Marketing & Communications Department, at 212 -241-9200 or newsmedia@mssm.edu . Failure to abide by Mount Sinai policies may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 84 STUDENT MISTREATMENT GUIDELINE This policy is meant to clarify expectations for educator actions and behaviors and to specify how learners can report mistreatment as well as how the relevant overseeing party in the School analyzes and acts upon reports. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) is dedicated to providing its students, postdocs, residents, faculty, staff and patients with an environment of respect, dignity, inclusion, trust, support, and protection of civil and professional discourse, free of mistreatment, abuse, or coercion, and without fear of retaliation. Educators (defined broadly to include anyone in a teaching or mentoring role, including faculty, postdocs, residents, fellows, nurses, staff, and students) bear significant responsibility in creating and maintaining this environment. As role models and evaluators, educators must practice appropriate profe ssional behavior toward, and in the presence of, students and trainees, who are in a particularly vulnerable position due to the formative and dependent nature of their status. These guidelines supplement the institutional policies on harassment, grievances and sexual misconduct; will assist in developing and maintaining optimal learning environments; and encourage educators, students and trainees alike to accept thei r responsibilities as representatives of the ISMMS in their interactions with their colleagues, patients, and staff. Mistreatment interferes with the learning environment, adversely impacts well -being and the trainee - mentor relationship, and has the potential for negatively impacting patient care and research. Inappropriate and unacceptable behaviors promote an atmosphere in which mistreatment is accepted and perpetuated in medical and graduate education. Everyone at the ISMMS deserves to experience a pro fessional learning and working environment. This policy focuses on the mistreatment of students and trainees. While individuals might perceive behaviors differently, examples of mistreatment include, but are not limited to being: Publicly embarrassed or h umiliated Threatened with physical harm or physically harmed Required to perform personal services Subjected to offensive remarks related to gender, sexual orientation, nationality, race or ethnicity Denied opportunities for training or rewards based upon gender, sexual orientation, nationality, race or ethnicity Subjected to lower evaluations or grades solely because of gender, sexual orientation, nationality, race or ethnicity Subjected to unwanted sexual advances Asked to exchange sexual favors for grade s or other rewards Subjected to the threat of revoking visa status for foreign nationals ISMMS has a zero tolerance policy towards mistreatment. Zero tolerance means that all reported incidents are scrutinized and result in an action plan. Although egregi ous or persistent mistreatment may require disciplinary action, we recognize in episodes of mistreatment an opportunity to develop, improve, and remediate unprofessional behaviors that detract from a learning and working 85 environment we can all be proud of. Please see more information on the Institutional Policies website , including information on reporting mechanisms, triage, graded response policy, and more. This mis treatment policy is closely aligned with our institution's Cultural Transformation efforts, the medical school's Racism and Bias Initiative, and related policies. STUDENT GRIEVANCE POLICY Students of the Graduate Program in Public Health are encouraged t o bring forward grievances. Grievances are defined as dissatisfaction occurring when a student feels or thinks that an event or a condition affects them is unjust, inequitable, or creates unnecessary hardships. Grievances include, but are not limited to: a cademic problems that cannot be readily resolved with Course Directors (including but not exclusive: grading, coursework or degree requirement decisions); mistreatment by employees; wrongful assessment or processing of fees; records or registration errors; and discrimination because of race, national origin, sex, marital status, religion, age or handicap. The grievance procedures described here do not apply to actions of professional misconduct (dishonest, unethical or irresponsible behavior), sexual harass ment, suspension and dismissal for cause. Grievance Procedure All students and faculty are encouraged to resolve issues in an amiable and equitable manner as soon as they arise. Recognizing that this does not always happen, the following procedures are set forth for students to follow to seek resolution to grievances. All students enrolled in the Graduate Program in Public Health with grievances should follow these guidelines: 1. The initial step of the student grievance procedure is for the student to fir st try to seek an informal resolution or redress through discussions with the person(s) alleged to have caused the grievance. This meeting should be held as soon as the student first becomes aware of the act or conditions that are the basis for the grievance. 2. If, in the opinion of the student or faculty person, a satisfactory solution or relief has not been provided, the student or faculty person should discuss the grievance with the appropriate Track Advisor. 3. If the grievance is still not resolved, the student or faculty member should prepare a written narrative that describes details including the nature of the grievance, when it occurred and what steps have already been taken towards resolution. This information should be communicated promptly to the P rogram Director and/or the Assistant Program Director who will then bring it to the attention of the Chair of the Academic Advisory Committee. 4. The Chair of the Academic Advisory Committee, will review the information, meet with those involved, investigate to gather all pertinent information, and share this information to the Academic Advisory Committee for review and recommended action. 5. Recommendation from the Academic Advisory Committee will be communicated to the Program Director. Based on the recomme ndation, the Program Director makes a final decision. All formal grievances will be tracked and every effort will be made to resolve them in a timely manner. 86 Depending upon the severity or complexity of the grievance , or at the request of the affected st udent, the case may be referred to an appropriate group or department at the Icahn School of Medicine, including the Title IX Coordinator, Office of the Ombudsperson, Program Director or the Deans. GIFT POLICY According to the policy of the Graduate Pro gram in Public Health, faculty cannot accept any form of gift from the students. Likewise, students cannot accept any gift from the faculty. ADMINISTRATIVE PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION The School of Medicine reserves the right to request an administrative psyc hiatric evaluation at any time for any reason. We will discuss the evaluation request with the student and send specific questions to the Director of Student Mental Health for assessment. The Office for Student Affairs (Medical School) or Program Director (Graduate School) will receive a written response from the psychiatrist regarding the student. The response is password protected in the student's file. The purpose of the evaluation always stems from concern for the student and a request for information to help in academic counseling. The evaluator may make specific recommendations to the School administration, which can then impose certain requirements on the student. Examples include required intervals for psychotherapy, mandated drug testing, or repeat administrative evaluations. Refusal to comply with an administrative evaluation or with recommendations stemming from an administrative evaluation is grounds for dismissal. We do not include these evaluations in the MSPE or share them with outside entities unless legally subpoenaed. "}
