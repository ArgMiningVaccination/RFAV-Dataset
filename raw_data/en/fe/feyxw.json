Within this course, we will discuss the physiological and psychological signs and symptoms of stress, and then explore realistic strategies to control the controllables, minimize your own stressors, and create a plan for recovery. Effective Cognitive Strategies Our most critical factor in success is how we THINK. Our thinking influences our behavior - it can be either an advantage or a handicap. We become what we think about most. Within this course, we will discuss how our thought process influences our performance, explore how your thoughts may be inhibiting your performance and goals, and create a plan for you to begin to deliberately focus your mind on positive thoughts that create energy, enthusiasm, and optimism. Introduction to Mindfulness Meditation Mindfulness is paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment, as non-reactively, nonjudgmentally and openheartedly as possible (Jon Kabat-Zinn). It is observation without criticism; being compassionate with yourself and others. Within this course, we will discuss the science and history of mindfulness, as well as practice ways to integrate these principles into your daily life.
