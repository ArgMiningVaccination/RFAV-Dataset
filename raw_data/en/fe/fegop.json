Medical professionals monitor the patient for symptoms of withdrawal and can act swiftly to address them or assist the patient in working through them. This is especially important when patients have developed physical dependence on substances and experience painful or dangerous withdrawal.

Generally, our patients complete medically supervised detox within 5-7 days. Can I detox at home? Medically-supervised detox is the best way to ensure comfort and safety. For this reason, we strongly discourage at-home detox. Withdrawal can be challenging and discouraging, which can increase the risk of relapse and overdose.
