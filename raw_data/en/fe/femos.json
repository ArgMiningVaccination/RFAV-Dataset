This reprioritized health sector funding and the correlative volume of health expenditure is evidently much needed, but it potentially masks two central issues. The first one is that the supposed link [between health expenditure and a population's health status remains highly debatable, at least in comparable countries (Berth\u00e9lemy, 2008). The second is the risk of losing sight of the initial objective \u2014 poverty reduction \u2014 as attention becomes increasingly focused on average health performances and away from the distribution of access to health.] [2](#pa2)This article is focused specifically on distribution of access to health and the related equity issues. Our aim is to determine whether health expenditure can influence the degree of concentration of access to health services. Due to publication space and data limitations, our investigations remain limited to child and mother health. Child and mother health is more easily studied than other health problems as better data is available. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in particular deliver a broad panel of indicators on child and mother health. Data collected through DHS were recently used by World Bank researchers (Gwatkin et al., 2007) to build indicators of health concentration. This data is also the core source of information for our work. [3](#pa3)Even restricted to child and mother health, the subject addressed here remains vast, as the datasets studied concern both health status and access to health services. We therefore honed our analysis onto the question of access to health services, as it gives the best reflection of the consequences of health expenditure in terms of equity. In comparison, indicators on health status are influenced by many other variables unrelated to health policy, such as nutrition. [4](#pa4)Literature on the issue of health distribution in developing countries has two major focuses. One school studies the within-population distribution of the benefits from public health spending. This \"benefit incidence analysis\" approach has been used to show that the public health policies are often regressive rather than progressive, and are only very rarely pro-poor. Findings like this clearly challenge the adequacy of health policies from a poverty reduction standpoint. However, since the benefit incidence literature only considers public expenditure, it does not directly address the question of access to health, and furthermore, it considers issues of inequality instead of equity. To fill this gap, various authors, many inspired by Wagstaff et al. (1991), have proposed to directly focus on indicators highlighting concentration of access to health and care services. Our paper belongs to this second branch of the literature, of which the report by Gwatkin et al. (2007) is the best recent illustration. The article is organized as follows. Section 2 begins with a brief recap on the stylized facts on the distributive aspects of health expenditure and access to health services in developing countries. Section 3 goes on to analyze the [distribution of access to health services by quintile. This analysis shows that health expenditure has little influence on the distribution of access to health among quintiles. It also shows that access to health care is significantly influenced by household socioeconomic factors, i.e. access to education (mother's education) and wealth. Finally, it shows that good governance influences the distribution of access to public-sponsored health services towards better equity. Section 4 takes a methodological look at the available measures of health concentration. Section 5 extends on section 3 by analyzing the variables explaining the concentration of access to health services, which confirms to a large extent the previous results. Section 6 concludes.] 2 - Stylized Facts on the Distributive Aspects of Health Expenditure and Access to Health Services 2.1 - Benefit Incidence Analysis [5](#pa5)Benefit incidence analysis consists in studying the incidence of implicit transfers received by households through public health expenditure programs. Works in this domain often concerns individual countries or regional samples (see for example the studies coordinated by Morrisson (2002) on Indonesia, Peru, Madagascar and Tanzania). These studies generally highlight that the distribution of public health expenditure is relatively more favorable to the richest quintile than to the poorest quintile, and hence that public expenditure tends to have a regressive impact. Comparative data collected on 26 developing and transition countries by Davoodi et al. (2003) largely confirms this conclusion. In Africa, Asia and transition countries, the richest quintile receives on average two to three times more public health expenditure than the poorest quintile. Similar results produced by Castro-Leal (2006) on Africa show that 30% of public health expenditure benefit goes to the richest quintile, that is more than two-and-a-half times the share that goes to the poorest quintile (12%). Davoodi et al. (2003) report that, in the Asia-Pacific region, this regressive pattern of health expenditure is eased by a progressive impact of the primary health expenditure (although their sample only counts two countries in this region). Distribution of Public Health Expenditure by Quintile Distribution of Public Health Expenditure by Quintile [6](#pa6) [There are marked differences among regions. Disparity in access to health expenditure is particularly strong in Africa compared to other regions. This is partially due to the geographic distribution of the population which, characterized by relatively weak urbanization, is not conducive to a progressive distribution of health expenditure unless the policy is to systematically develop primary care centers in rural areas where poor are concentrated. Davoodi et al. also highlight a very strong correlation between the ratio of public health expenditure benefiting the richest quintile to public health expenditure benefiting the poorest quintile and the share of urban population. In poor countries where the vast majority of the population lives in remote rural areas, targeting the poor would entail implementing a decentralization policy aimed at creating primary health centers (Marek et al., 2006).] [7](#pa7)The same data show a positive correlation between this highest quintile/ lowest quintile benefit ratio and some indicators of governance (government effectiveness and regulatory quality), and population access to information and media. Paradoxically, policies that prone free-of-charge access to certain treatments can add to the regressive nature of the distribution of public health expenditure, despite the intended social objectives. To illustrate this point, the free distribution of antiretroviral treatments, a policy implemented in various countries in recent years, can deliver relatively more benefit to the least poor individuals, given that access to antiretroviral drugs is limited to clinics boasting qualified personnel able to administer this treatment. Interestingly, Davoodi et al. find that there is a positive correlation between a more progressive distribution of health expenditure and a better average population-wide access to health services (table 2). However, their study does not say anything on the influence of health expenditure on access to health services. To analyze this, it would be necessary to combine living [standards surveys, which form the basis of benefit incidence analysis, with DHS surveys.] Correlation Between the Ratio of Health Expenditure for the Poorest Quintile/Health Expenditure for the Richest Quintile and Access-to-health Variables Correlation Between the Ratio of Health Expenditure for the Poorest Quintile/Health Expenditure for the Richest Quintile and Access-to-health Variables 2.2 - Studies on the Distribution of Access to Health Services [8](#pa8)Studies on measuring the concentration of access to health services (and access to health in general) are based on a methodology proposed by Wagstaff et al. (1991). Gwatkin et al. (2007) used the DHS data available in a large number of countries to approach this question empirically. [9](#pa9)Data reported by Gwatkin et al. show that the health conditions of the poorest layers of the population are radically worse than those of the richest layers. Table 3, using data published by Gwatkin et al., reveals that children in the poorest quintile have on average a 1.84-fold higher risk of dying before the age of 5, 2.88-fold higher risk of being affected by severe stunting, and 3.29-fold higher risk of severe underweight than children in the richest quintile. However, in contradiction with what was shown by benefit incidence analyses, Africa generally performs a little better than other regions, notably Latin America, possibly partially because of smaller income disparities which influence the outcome through private health expenditure distribution. Ratio Between the Richest Quintile and the Poorest Quintile for Various Indicators of Health Ratio Between the Richest Quintile and the Poorest Quintile for Various Indicators of Health [10](#pa10) [The analyses cited above are formulated in terms of inequality rather than inequity. Assessing equity in public health policy requires an estimate of whether individuals presenting the same needs receive the same public health services (\"horizontal equity\"). We borrowed the data collected by Gwatkin et al. to study access to health care according to household wealth. The data show that health policies are strongly inequitable in most of the developing and transition countries studied, particularly in Africa and South Asia, where women's access to assisted delivery and contraceptive methods is over 3-fold and over 7-fold more frequent in the richest quintile than in the poorest quintile, highlighting a concentration that is appreciably bigger than in other regions (table 4). Children's access to vaccines is also more concentrated in Africa and in South Asia than elsewhere.] Ratio Between the Richest Quintile and the Poorest Quintile for Various Vaccines and Maternal and Child Care Ratio Between the Richest Quintile and the Poorest Quintile for Various Vaccines and Maternal and Child Care [11](#pa11) [Table 5 also suggests that access to care for fevers, respiratory infections and diarrhea is highly concentrated in the richest layers of the population, and again this inequity is stronger in Africa and South Asia than in other regions. Although fragmented, this information does help illustrate the inequitable character of health policies, which reduces their capacity to help alleviate poverty.] Ratio Between the Richest Quintile and the Poorest Quintile for Access to Treatment for Common Diseases Ratio Between the Richest Quintile and the Poorest Quintile for Access to Treatment for Common Diseases [12](#pa12)In the sections that follow, we look to go beyond the descriptiveness of these observations to explore the explanatory variables that dictate more or less equitable access to health services. 3 - Regressions by Quintile 3.1 - Data [13](#pa13)The data reported in Gwatkin et al. (2007) cover 52 countries, with two (sometimes three) observations at different times for a majority of them. [[1]](#no1) [14](#pa14)This study is based on domestic data collected through DHS surveys. These surveys are largely geared to child and mother health. The data also include information on household assets and attributes, which were used to build an indicator of wealth by quintile. The assets considered are not the same for all countries/years, although they always include a list of standard variables such as access to electricity, to drinking water, etc. Finally, the [dataset is completed with socioeconomic variables such as percentage of educated mothers by quintile.] Among the health variables available, we focus exclusively on indicators of access to health services, as described below: - full vaccine coverage: percentage of children aged 12 to 23 months who had received a dose of BCG vaccine, measles vaccine, and three doses of DPT and polio vaccines by the time of the survey, excluding polio vaccine given at birth; - treatment of fever: percentage of children with fever, with or without cough or rapid breathing, in the 2 weeks before the survey who had sought medical advice for fever from any health facility or health provider; and percentage who went through a public structure; - treatment of diarrhea: percentage of children with diarrhea in the 2 weeks before the survey who had been taken for treatment at any medical facility or provider; and percentage who went through a public structure; - treatment of acute respiratory infection: percentage of children with cough and rapid breathing in the 2 weeks before the survey who had been taken for treatment at any medical facility or provider; and percentage who went through a public structure; - antenatal care visit: percentage of women presenting one or more births in the 5 years before the survey who had received at least one antenatal care visit from a medically-trained person before her most recent birth; - delivery attendance: percentage of births in the 5 years before the survey attended to by a medically-trained person; and percentage of all deliveries in the 5 years before the survey occurring in a public-sector health facility. - total health expenditure per capita, in thousand international dollars per capita; - public health expenditure per capita, in thousand international dollars per capita. 3.2 - Descriptive Statistics [17](#pa17) [Before studying the relation between health expenditure and distribution of access to health services, it is crucial to first test for a relation between health expenditure (total or public) and average access to health services. Table 5 shows that there is a significant correlation between health expenditure per capita and our variables on access to health services. However, this correlation is made difficult to interpret as there is a clear problem of endogeneity. In addition to causality issues, these correlations can be misleading because health expenditure is potentially correlated to other explanatory variables for access to health services. This is the case with mother education, which is highly correlated with health expenditure (with a coefficient of correlation of about 0.5) and equally highly correlated with our access to health services variables.] Correlations Between Access to Health Services, Health Expenditure, and Mother's Education Correlations Between Access to Health Services, Health Expenditure, and Mother's Education [18](#pa18)To go further, it is necessary to proceed with a multivariate econometric analysis. Since the purpose of our study is to analyze how access to health services is distributed rather than average access to them, we pushed this analysis into the following section, where we study the explanatory variables of access to health services by quintile. This per-quintile access is dependent on household socioeconomics, which we identify here via household wealth and mother's education. [19](#pa19)The first step to illustrating the distribution of access to health services is to observe differences among the richest and the poorest quintiles in a population. Figure 1 illustrates this for access to vaccines. It points to a significant concentration of access to health, except in countries with high average access to care. Average Vaccine Coverage for the Poorest and Richest Quintiles Average Vaccine Coverage for the Poorest and Richest QuintilesNote: countries are ranked according to average vaccine coverage. [20](#pa20) [Figure 2 describes the distribution of access to vaccines by quintile of wealth, illustrating that different countries show vastly different patterns of distribution of access to health services. In some countries, health care access increases regularly with quintiles (Peru, Mauritania). In other countries, the difference appears more abruptly at the extreme quintiles (Cambodia). Finally, there are countries that present non-monotonicity of the distribution, generally associated to a high average level of health care access (Armenia).] Vaccine Coverage by Quintile for Selected Countries Vaccine Coverage by Quintile for Selected Countries [21](#pa21)Figure 3 shows the distribution of access to education for mothers by quintile. Here again, the pattern of distribution varies strongly between countries. Some cases are characterized by an exponential shape implying a very strong concentration (Cambodia, Mauritania), whereas in other cases there is only limited progress from one quintile to the next (Peru), or even egalitarian distribution (Armenia). Mother's Education by Quintile for Selected Countries Mother's Education by Quintile for Selected Countries [22](#pa22) [Finally, figure 4 on vaccine coverage shows the correlation of distribution of mother's education and health care access. This chart illustrates that mother education contributes significantly to improved child access to health services. Even there, however, there are important differences in profiles between countries. To explore further, it is necessary to proceed with econometric analysis.] Mother's Education and Vaccine Coverage by Quintile Mother's Education and Vaccine Coverage by Quintile 3.3 - Regressions of the Distribution of Access to Health Services by Quintile Explanatory Variables and Specification [23](#pa23)The main explanatory variables focused on here are aggregate health expenditure and socioeconomic household characteristics broken down into quintiles. We complete by investigating how good governance influences the distribution of access to health services. [24](#pa24)This research presented a methodological difficulty stemming from the absence of data on health expenditure disaggregated by type of health service, while indicators on access to health services are by nature highly disaggregated by type of health care. Consequently, we can only test the following joint hypothesis: [there is a relation, in international cross-country data, between total health expenditure and expenditures associated to particular child or mother health services;] - averaged across the various countries studied, health expenditure allocated to these specific treatments is effective. [25](#pa25)In a first step, for each of our variables on access to health services by quintile, we run a regression analysis on total health expenditure per capita and on the wealth and mother education variables (table 7). In an additional table (table A1), the health expenditure variable is replaced by public health expenditure per capita, which has particular relevance when the dependent variable describes access to health services in public structures. Equation of Access to Health Services (Equation 1) Equation of Access to Health Services (Equation 1) [26](#pa26)In a second step, where there was a significant relation between health expenditure and health care access, we test whether the corresponding parameter varies between quintiles in order to study the extent to which health expenditure appears to favor a specific quintile of the population. [27](#pa27)All regressions are run using a random-effects specification for country, such as: [28](#pa28)where i stands for countries/years, j is the quintile, and ui and vi,j are error terms. Unobservable characteristics for the various countries are taken into account as far as possible by the term ui. Models could not be estimated using a fixed-effects specification since national health expenditure is not disaggregated by quintile. Results Health Expenditure [29](#pa29)Generally speaking, we find little significant effect of health expenditure per capita on the indicators of health care access by quintile, except for access to certain health services in public structures: treatment of acute respiratory affections, medical treatment for fever, and assisted delivery in public structures. There was relatively little difference in the results when using total health expenditure or public health expenditure, even though, logically, public expenditure would be expected to have a more significant effect on access to health services in public structures. [30](#pa30) [A first-look conclusion from these results is that it appears unlikely, in the countries considered, that health expenditure, whether total or public, influences health care access, whatever the quintile considered. For the three access to health care in public structures variables that showed a significant relation with public health expenditure, we tested whether this expenditure had different effects on different quintiles, i.e. testing the following relation:] [31](#pa31)The results are reported in table A2, which gives ?j coefficients as well as the results of a ?2 heterogeneity test on these ?j parameters. For the three health care access variables considered, the parameters were very similar across the first three quintiles but decreased appreciably for the 4th and 5th quintiles. It thus appears that public health expenditure has some progressive effects for at least three variables related to access to health care in public structures. Mother's Education [32](#pa32) [Our most important finding is that child and maternal health variables are systematically very strongly correlated to mother education. The magnitude of the estimated parameters is high, except for access to care in public structures (tables 7 and A1). The figures ranged from 0.27 to 0.48 for access to health care for children and from 0.62 to 0.96 for access to maternal health care (antenatal visit and assisted delivery). These parameters can be directly interpreted as the increased share of children (or mothers) gaining access to health care when proportion of educated mothers increases. For example, a one percentage point increase in share of educated mothers corresponds to an increase of about 0.5% in vaccine coverage for children. The parameters for access to care in public structures were also significant, but less strongly. This is logical, since mother education influences health care demand while access to care in public structures is significantly dependent on supply.] [33](#pa33)Hence, a provisional conclusion of our results would be that developing education for girls would be a promising initiative geared to increasing child and maternal health. [34](#pa34)To check the robustness of this conclusion, we also tested whether these parameters were stable across quintiles. It is possible that mother education could only influence access to child health care in the relatively well-off households, in which case a policy aimed at reinforcing the education of girls would not necessarily alleviate poverty in terms of access to health care for children. This was tested via the following equation: [35](#pa35)Estimates of ?j parameters are reported in table 8 for all regressions on access to health care (except access to health care in public structures). We found that mother education tends to systematically decrease with household wealth. The structural heterogeneity of parameters across quintiles is very significant, except for access to medical treatment of fever, where the effect of mother education appears stable across quintiles. These results strengthen our previous conclusion: educating girls in the poorest quintiles appears highly relevant to improving health care access for children and mothers in these quintiles. Incidence of Mother's Education by Quintile (Equation 3, Parameters ?j) Incidence of Mother's Education by Quintile (Equation 3, Parameters ?j) [36](#pa36) [Our results on the effect of mother education could be criticized as biased due to a correlation between mother education and household wealth. Although this correlation is very significant, it remains quantitatively rather weak. The variance in wealth explains only 14% of the variance in mother education across quintiles. Furthermore, our regressions controlled for this variance by introducing wealth by quintile in the list of explanatory variables.] Wealth [37](#pa37)Analysis on the influence of wealth on access to health care by quintile (tables 7 and A1) highlighted few significant results, and some parameters were even negative instead of positive in terms of vaccine coverage and treatment of diarrhea. Using a between-specification regression led to the same nil relation between wealth and health care access. However, these results remain fragile, since the definition of household wealth is somewhat arbitrarily dependent on availability of asset variables, meaning that definitions of wealth vary across countries even if the same method is used to build this variable. Consequently, this parameter is potentially affected by measurement error, which could in turn contaminate the estimation of the mother education effect that was significantly correlated to wealth. To control for this, we re-ran the same regressions without the wealth variable, but introducing a different constant by quintile, according to the following formula: [38](#pa38) [In this regression, we lose the input through which concentration of wealth can vary across countries, but we preserve the possibility of testing that the richest quintiles have better access to child and maternal health care. Table A3 presents the estimates for the ?i parameters (I = 1 in 4, taking the 5th quintile as reference point), the level of significance for ?2 testing that this parameter vector is non-zero, and the parameter estimated for mother education. In the equations for access to health care in public structures, total health expenditure per capita is replaced by public health expenditure per capita (as in table A1). Excluding regressions run on access to care in public structures, our results clearly show that access to care increases with quintile, signifying that wealth has a positive influence on health care access. Concerning child access to health care in public structures, the trend is towards significant differences by quintile in favor of the poorest quintiles, which suggests that public structures work the right way from a distributive point of view. This result is coherent with our previous partial results indicating that in terms of access to treatment for acute respiratory infections and fever in public structures, the poorest quintiles benefit rather more from public health expenditure than the richest quintiles.] On the whole, it is reasonable to conclude that household wealth has a significant effect on access to health care, in the same way as mother education, despite the weak significance of the ? parameters in tables 7 and A1. Even though we cannot precisely quantify this influence with the data available, it seems (table A3) that access to child and maternal health care is 6 (treatment of diarrhea) to 13 (vaccine coverage) percentage points higher in the richest quintile than the poorest quintile. This difference is even greater for maternal health, especially medically-assisted birth delivery which is about 19 percentage points higher. Overall, this difference in access to health services between the poorest and richest quintiles averages potentially higher than that imposed by the disparity in mothers' access to education. In the countries studied, an average 6% and 15% of mothers in the first and last quintiles, respectively, had complete primary education, i.e. a difference of 9 percentage points only. Considering the value of the estimated parameters for the effect of mother education, the effect of between-quintile differences in wealth quantitatively predominates the effect of difference in mother education. Governance [39](#pa39)Finally, echoing the study by Davoodi et al. (2003) on the distribution of health expenditure benefits, we examined whether progress in governance could improve access to health services. We found very significant results concerning the access to health services in public structures, and less significant [results concerning the access to health services generally. This result is logical, and we report here only the results concerning health services in public structures.] The proposed test is similar to that implemented previously to analyze the effect of health expenditure. The estimated equation is as follows: [40](#pa40)In this equation, significantly positive values for ?j parameters would indicate that good governance improves access to health care services. However, as a general rule, this was not the pattern we found. On the other hand, we did observe that vector ? is significantly different from zero, which allows us to interpret the structure of this vector. In this equation, the governance variable is alternately one of the six components of the World Bank governance indicator. [41](#pa41)We find very significant results for four indicators: voice and accountability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and rule of law. These results are reported in table 9 on government effectiveness and table A4 for the full set of governance indicators. However, we have only partial results for control of corruption, and no results for political stability (not reported). Influence of Government Effectiveness on Access to Health Services in Public Structures Influence of Government Effectiveness on Access to Health Services in Public Structures [42](#pa42)More precisely, the vector of e parameters always systematically decreases, with a strong decrease for the two last quintiles compared to the first three. Our results thus suggest that under bad governance, the rich have better access than the poor to health services in public structures. Averaging across the various indicators used, a one-point decrease in governance score increases [the differential of access to health services in public structures between the first and the last quintile by 20 percentage points. The difference is particularly strong for the government effectiveness and regulatory quality variables. Given that the differential on governance indicators between the countries with the best and worst governance profiles is about 2.2, this means that progress in governance would considerably change the distribution of access to public health services.] 4 - The Concentration of Access to Health: Methodological Issues 4.1 - Definition of the Concentration Index [43](#pa43)Concentration curves and concentration indices have become standard tools for assessing equity in access to health. They were initially introduced by Wagstaff et al. (1991). The concentration curve and the associated concentration index make it possible to concisely characterize the distribution of a specific health variable relative to individual wealth. It is defined as follows: - the horizontal axis shows the cumulative percentage of households, house holds being ranked from the poorest to the richest; - the vertical axis shows the cumulative percentage of a health access variable for the same households. [44](#pa44)Figure 5 gives an illustration of a concentration curve where the health variable is vaccine coverage, which is clearly weaker among the poor. If all children had the same level of access to vaccines whatever their living standards, then the concentration curve would be the diagonal. On the other hand, if access to health was concentrated in favor of the poor, the concentration curve would be above the diagonal. Illustration of a Concentration Curve Illustration of a Concentration Curve [45](#pa45)The concentration index is defined as twice the area between the concentration curve and the diagonal, with, by convention, a positive sign if it is below the diagonal and a negative sign otherwise. 4.2 - The Issue of Correlation Between Concentration and Average Level of Health [46](#pa46) [The concentration index calculated according to the definition above is not easily interpretable as it remains to some extent correlated with average health level as long as the health variable is binary or simply bounded, which is usually the case. Intuitively, if the health variable is bounded, an increase of the average will be concomitant with a decrease in concentration. A borderline case is when the average is close to the maximum value reachable by the health variable, in which case a large number of individuals are inevitably close to the peak value, and the concentration is close to zero.] Erreygers (2006) demonstrated that if the variable of interest is bounded by a minimum value a and a maximum value b, then the concentration index C and the average |i of this variable satisfy the following property: [47](#pa47)The demonstration of this property hinges on the definition of the most favorable distribution for the rich that would be compatible with an average |i. This distribution is characterized by the fact that proportion [48](#pa48) [of the population has access to the maximum level ?, whereas the rest of the population (in proportion 1-?) only has access to level b. In this hypothesis, the concentration index is equal to:] [49](#pa49)In the case of a binary variable (which is the case for our data), this implies that: [50](#pa50)Wagstaff (2005) suggested correcting this problem by dividing the concentration index by its maximum value, so that this new indicator could vary between -1 and 1. This Wagstaff formula, for cases of binary variables, then becomes: [51](#pa51)As shown by Erreygers (2006), this formulation may create problems too, notably because under certain circumstances it ends up minimizing the distributive consequences of certain distortions in the distribution of access to health. To illustrate this point, let us suppose a two-tier population structure in which the poorest, in proportion 1-?, have no access to the health service considered, whereas the richest, in proportion ?, have full access. Under these conditions, the average of the health variable is a and it is easy to verify that its concentration is equal to 1-?. The Wagstaff index is then equal to: [52](#pa52)Consequently, it is invariant with ?. As a result, any increase in ?, which leads to an improvement of the distribution of the considered health service, has no effect on the corrected concentration calculated according to Wagstaff's formula. [53](#pa53)According to Erreygers, the correction proposed by Wagstaff would then be excessive. The alternative could be the formula initially proposed by Wagstaff et al. (1991), which they called the generalized concentration index: [54](#pa54) [This indicator possesses good properties when the distribution is transformed in favor of the rich. More exactly, it respects what Erreygers calls a \"property of transfer\", which means that a change of the distribution in favor of the rich that leaves the average invariant leads to a higher measure of concentration. This indicator does however remain sensitive to linear changes in the health variable (contrary to W). Erreygers then proposes an alternative indicator insensitive to a transformation in the health variable and that possesses the property of transfer. In the case of a binary variable, this indicator is in fact proportional to the generalized concentration index. More precisely, it comes to 4-fold the generalized concentration index V.] In what follows, we integrate both the W and V corrected concentration indexes, which are preferable to the standard concentration index C. 5 - Results of Concentration Regressions [55](#pa55)This section gives an analysis of the explanatory variables on the concentration of access to health services. The explanatory variables correspond to those that we used in the analysis by quintile, i.e. we attempt to explain the concentration of access to health services according to concentrations of maternal education and wealth, and according to level of health expenditure. It is wholly logical to introduce as explanatory variables the concentrations of the socioeconomic variables that influence access to health. The introduction of health expenditure as an explanatory variable makes it possible to test whether, on average, in the sample of countries considered, health expenditure pushes the distribution of access to health towards greater equity. As in the section on distribution by quintile, we alternately use total expenditure and public expenditure variables, and we only report results obtained with total expenditure, except for access to health in public structures where we use public expenditure instead. Afterwards, we add governance indicators to the list of explanatory variables in order to test, as in our analysis by quintile, whether an improvement in governance can improve equity in access to health services. [56](#pa56)The basic equation which we test is as follows: [57](#pa57)where C (.) is a concentration index. Following the previous discussion, we use the modified concentration indexes proposed by Wagstaff and Erreygers. If we did not use these corrections, we would have to introduce into our regressions the average level of access to health services as a control variable. This average [level is significantly correlated to health expenditure per capita, but it is also correlated to the average level of mother's education, which we would also have to introduce because the standard measure of concentration of education presents the same problem of correlation to the average as seen with access to health services, making it impossible to correctly test the effect of public expenditure due to a severe problem of multicolinearity among explanatory variables.] Tables 10 and A5 report the results obtained with the Wagstaff-corrected and Erreygers-corrected concentration indices, respectively. Regressions using Wagstaff s correction present better results, notably with an appreciably higher share of variance explained by our explanatory variables. Equation of Concentration of Access to Health Services (Concentration Corrected According to Wagstaff) Equation of Concentration of Access to Health Services (Concentration Corrected According to Wagstaff) Mother's Education [58](#pa58)Concerning the role played by mother's education, our results are consistent with the conclusions reached in our per-quintile analysis. The concentration of mother's education has a very significant influence on the concentration of access to health services. Concentration of Wealth [59](#pa59)The concentration of wealth has little significant effect, which is also coherent with our per-quintile regressions. We also tested (results not reported) the effect of GINI coefficients using data available for dates as close as possible to the DHS survey dates (source: World Bank World Development Indicators), without success. Hence, concentration of income/wealth does not appear a particularly relevant variable for explaining concentration of access to health services. However, the poor quality of available data on income and wealth concentration should prompt caution with this conclusion. Health Expenditure [60](#pa60)In most cases, health expenditure has a significant effect on the concentration of access to health, at least according to the Wagstaff correction. This result brings a new element compared to our per-quintile regressions, where we had found only little effect of health expenditure on the distribution of access to health services by quintile. Generally speaking, we find that, on average for our sample of countries, increasing health expenditure tends to promote greater equity in access to health services. This result seems particularly robust as regards the effect of public health expenditure on access to health services in public structures, as it is found with both the Wagstaff and the Erreygers corrections. The magnitude of this effect does however remain fairly rather small. An increase of expenditure of US$10 only leads to a concentration reduction of about 0.002 point. Governance [61](#pa61) [An improvement of equity could come from progress in governance. We tested this by alternately introducing into regression (13) each of the four governance variables that had given significant results in the per-quintile analysis.] The results reported here are only those obtained with the Wagstaff correction. First, table 11 confirms our previous conclusions on the existence of a very significant positive effect of good governance on equity in access to health services in public structures. Again, it is useful to discuss the magnitude of the obtained parameters, which proved strong. Between countries with the best- and worst-quality governance, differences in the levels of governance variables are responsible for a change in concentration of access to health services in public structures of around 0.25 (rule of law) to 0.38 (government effectiveness). Effect of Governance on Access to Health Services in Public Structures Effect of Governance on Access to Health Services in Public Structures [62](#pa62) [We also find that in some cases, governance has a significant influence on equity of access to health services in general, and not only in public structures. This is particularly true for access to treatment for fever and diarrhea. On the other hand, we do not find significant effects on vaccine coverage or antenatal visits.] On the whole, our regressions on the concentration indexes broadly confirm the conclusions obtained using per-quintile regressions. 6 - Conclusion [63](#pa63)The starting point of our study was to correlate health expenditure with equity of access to health services. The combination of our results by quintile and our regressions on concentration indexes leads us to conclude that increasing public health expenditure only delivers a slight improvement in equity of access to health in public structures. Access to health is determined above all by household wealth and by mother's education. [64](#pa64)On mother's education, our conclusions seem very robust and are totally consistent under both regressions by quintile and concentration equations. Efforts to provide more education to girls could, especially if targeted at the poorer segments of population, have a major impact on improving child and maternal health in poor households. These findings prompt us to underline the tight complementarities between educational policy and health policy in the context of fighting poverty. [65](#pa65)On the effect of wealth, the results are more fragile. On the one hand, it is clear that households belonging to the highest quintile have better access to health services than lowest-quintile households, even though this result is mitigated when considered access to care in public structures alone. On the other hand, it was impossible for us to establish a correlation between the distribution of wealth and the distribution of access to health services. An attempt to correlate the concentration of access to health and the concentration of incomes measured at national level also failed. [66](#pa66)Finally, our econometric results show that governance can play a strong and significant role in improving equity of access to health services. Access to child and maternal health services in public structures is distributed in a more equitable way in countries with good governance, be it defined by voice and accountability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, or rule of law. [67](#pa67) [The analysis presented here remains partial: we only addressed the issue of access to child and maternal health services, and it would be useful to complement this work by an analysis of general access to health. We only used data by quintile, whereas individual micro-data could also provide useful insight, notably to strengthen our conclusions on the effect of socioeconomic variables on access to health. There is an arbitrage to be made between the cross-country comparative dimension of the data and their microeconomic dimension: the macroeconomic approach facilitates comparative analysis, whereas the microeconomic approach uses richer information. This study opted to work with the cross-country comparative dimension, but studies using individual data would doubtless provide equally useful insight.] Sample of Countries Used for The Econometrics Analysis (Gwatkin Et Al., 2007) [68](#pa68) [Asia-Pacific: Cambodia (2000), Indonesia (1997, 2002/03), Philippines (1998, 2003) and Vietnam (1997, 2002).] [69](#pa69)Europe and Central Asia: Kazakhstan (1995, 1999), Kirghizstan (1997), Uzbekistan (1996), Turkey (1993, 1998) and Armenia (2000).
