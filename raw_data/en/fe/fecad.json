But eight-year-old Ben, who became autistic after being born prematurely, had little understanding of what football was all about. All he could do was kick the ball at his mum Joanne once it was placed in front of him. But now, weeks after taking a remarkable herbal concoction from India, he's scoring goals with all the confidence of a young Michael Owen. Joanne, of Bentley, Doncaster, says: 'It's just as if something clicked in his brain. He has been playing football since he was three but never had an insight into the game. 'Now he kicks the ball to either side of me, over my head and can score goals for the first time. He even cheers when he scores. It's wonderful.' The herbal mixture, G-therapy, was developed by Dr Gunwant Oswal, of Pune, India, for children with behavioural disorders. Ben is one of 30 patients in Britain and Ireland using the medication, which is based on an ancient Indian system of medicine. Dr Oswal has treated more than 2,000 patients in India and claims 70 pc of them have improved. His discovery is not a cure for behavioural disorders, but it is the first medication to offer fresh hope to sufferers of cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism and Down's syndrome. The G-therapy formula is secret but includes a mixture of herb extracts, minerals and biochemic salts in tablet form. Dr Oswal claims the treatment stimulates the neuro-transmitters and removes blockages in the brain cells with no harmful side-effects. The medicine is thought to boost the body's immune system. Just how quickly patients respond depends on the extent of the brain damage but there have been significant improvements in mental retardation at the motor and higher cortical functions of the brain. Just how G-therapy works is not clear. Dr Oswal, who is calling for further research into the medication, says: 'Since my work is on a small scale I have no idea about the actual process taking place inside the brain.' After an initial private consultation on visits to Britain, Dr Oswal supplies the pills directly from India, with the medication tailored to meet individual needs. He monitors changes in the patient's condition by video. A course of G-therapy lasts up to five years and costs about \u00a3100 a month, significantly less than conventional approaches to behavioural disorders. Among the British G-therapy advocates are Pippa Foster, 49, and her husband Titus, 50, of Crawley, Sussex, who have two children, Francis, nine, and Kieran, seven. Kieran developed autism after being given a measles, mumps and rubella vaccination at 22 months. Says Pippa: 'He seemed to be normal and outgoing until having the vaccine. At our playgroup he related to the other children and loved painting. After the vaccine he couldn't sit and concentrate and became aggressive. 'His behaviour was so distressing I took him out of the playgroup. 'He was diagnosed as autistic at 2 1/2 . He withdrew into a world of his own. His language suffered, he had terrible temper tantrums, was destructive and became obsessed with watching videos. The videos were more real for him than we were. We couldn't reach him. 'We heard about G-therapy from a local woman who was trying it with her daughter, who had cerebral palsy. We met Dr Oswal at a Crawley hotel and started Kieran on G-therapy in December 1997. 'The results were extraordinary. Within 24 hours of taking his first tablet, Kieran changed dramatically. We were watching TV and he asked us questions about the programme. We were amazed. It was like he was with us instead of being in another country.' Dr Oswal, a graduate of Pune University, turned his back on modern medicine, fascinated by his father's books on homeopathy. He has studied the causes and effects of behavioural disorders since 1971 and prepared his medicines and conducted experiments. Speaking from his home in Pune, the 51-year-old father-of-two says: 'I found there were no conventional medical solutions for disorders of the central nervous system and at my practice I get many victims of strokes and paralysis. 'I tried different combinations of herbs and biochemical salts and came up with a medicine which had a significant effect on these conditions. 'Most of the patients who go on G-therapy show positive changes. It not only improves their quality of life but there are a few children who are now almost near normal.'
