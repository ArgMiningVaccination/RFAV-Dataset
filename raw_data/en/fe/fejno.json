This tea is also good for perimenopause symptoms. Perimenopause or premenopause is a relatively new term coined in the last twenty years by the medical community to describe symptoms caused by normal hormonal fluctuations that occur as a woman moves closer to her menopause. These symptoms can be broad-ranging and diffuse and differ for every woman, causing a lot of confusion and anxiety. And the younger you are, the more confused and worried you may be. Below are natural herbs that will help balance the estrogen in your body along with managing menopausal symptoms. [Raspberry leaf](https://www.mountainmausremedies.com/raspberry-leaf/) is naturally high in magnesium, niacin, calcium, selenium, magnesium, thiamine, potassium, iron, vitamin C and B vitamins, which make it helpful for leg cramps, nausea, improving sleep, hot flashes and may prevent anemia. This specific combination of nutrients, found in Raspberry leaf extract, make it extremely beneficial for the female reproductive system. Minerals in Raspberry leaf also help to strengthen the nervous system, and the vitamin C is important. In addition, the calcium contained in the leaves may be useful for those who are susceptible to osteoporosis, as estrogen levels drop. It may also help heavy or erratic periods, night sweats, moodiness, insomnia and other symptoms of menopause. [Chastetree berry](https://www.mountainmausremedies.com/vitex-chaste-tree-berries/), don't be fooled by the name - chasteberry, often used in conjunction with the herb dong quai, won't zap your libido. Known as the great equalizer of female hormones, chasteberry can help boost your sex drive by increasing dopamine levels in the brain. Chasteberry is used to help shift your hormone production so you are making more progesterone and less estrogen. Balancing hormonal swings can help you get your appetite under control, which may translate to weight loss. In addition to suppressing appetite, chasteberry can help relieve depression and insomnia, Northrup says.

[Black Cohosh](https://www.mountainmausremedies.com/black-cohosh-root/) stimulates the body's ability to produce its own hormones and only what it actually needs. It has been used to relieve hot flashes, excessive sweating, and depression, and reduces dryness in the vagina.Obtained from the root of the plant, Black Cohosh has been used for dysmenorrhea, to enhance bone formation and coronary heart disease in early postmenopausal women. [Valerian root](https://www.mountainmausremedies.com/valerian-root/) is valued for its sedative properties. It has been used to for menstrual cramps, amenorrhea and dysmenorrhea. Its anti-spasmodic properties also help for relaxing uterine smooth muscle, as well as mood related symptoms like nervousness, anxiety and insomnia. Valerian root tincture contains many active compounds such as valerenic acid which has been said to prevent the degradation of GABA, a neurotransmitter that is responsible for muscle tone and nerve impulses. Valerian directly binds to GABA receptors in the brain, resulting in feelings of mental calmness and relaxation. [Dandelion Root](https://www.mountainmausremedies.com/dandelion-root/) - Many women are bothered by water retention during menopause.

All Rights Reserved Posted by J. Foxworth on 17th Sep 2015 Thank you! What a great thing you have done for women like me!!! At the age of 50, I was a hard working administrator. I had many meetings to attend, and how embarrassing they were, to sit there with my ice water, fan, and starting to sweat at the more inopportune moments. I wanted to crawl under the table when beads of sweat rolled down my face and neck. But there was nothing I could do. I tried soy milk shares and all kinds of concoctions from the health food store. But nothing really worked. I was doomed to look like something was wrong with me. But then a friend told me she had tried Mountain Maus Remedies and how great it was. And it is: thank you for all your help!!\" Posted by Jeanne on 17th Sep 2015 I thought child birth was bad, but at least it was over in a few hours, Menopause lasts forever!!!! I was having hot flashes (power surges) every hour, night sweats a few times a night, severe depression, and vaginal dryness. All of which were wreaking havoc on my marriage. My girlfriend said she had gone on the internet and found Maus Estrogen Balance. It worked for her, and WOW it worked for me too! Thank you for giving me my life and my marriage back.\" Posted by Donna D. on 10th May 2015 Purchased this about a month ago and I can't beleive how well it works. Would recommend this for anyone having mood swings, night sweats, and leg cramps. Posted by Unknown on 15th Mar 2015 Last year was my first year of random sweaty the shirt pits.So far my \"sweaties\" have tried to make a big comeback and seem to be damp mildly pits. There are a few other areas us ladies may find this useful to get correct or improve flow in, for me it has helped this too (I know you 50ish understand;-). Thank you for something that adjusts things enough I do not need to turn to chemicals and avoid prescribed items a while longer. Janet "}
