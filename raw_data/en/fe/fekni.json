Cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes are the NCDs responsible for the greatest number of deaths worldwide and are the leading cause of death globally killing approximately 36 million people every year from heart diseas e, stroke, diabetes, cancers etc. with major negative consequences for socioeconomic development. Th e main cause is the increased exposure to tobacco use, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol, as well as inadequate health care services. There are proven interventions to prevent non - communicable diseases and manage them in people with early or established disease. These interventions could prevent millions of early deaths from non - communicable diseases and are highly cost - effecti ve, able to be implemented in resource - poor settings, and would strengthen health systems, in particular primary health care. This training module is meant to provi de information and knowledge that is essential in the prevention and management of NCDs. Acknowledgements CONTENTS CONTENTS PAGE NO.

The se are of long duration and generally have slow progression. All age groups and all regions are affected by NCDs. NCDs are often associa ted with older age groups, but evidence shows that 16 million of all deaths attributed to non - communicable diseases (NCDs) occur before the age of 70 1 . The major N on - communicable diseases are Cancer , Diabetes , Cardiovascular diseases (like heart attacks a nd stroke), Rhe umatic Heart Disease (RHD) and C hronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Asthma . Children, adults and the elderly are all vulnerable to the risk factors that contribute to non - communicable diseases. The World Health Organization's World Heal th Report 2002 identified tobacco use, alcohol consumption, overweight, physical inactivity, stress and high fat diet as the most important risk factors for NCDs . An important way to reduce the burden of NCDs on global public health is by focusing on the i mportance of lessening , preventing, detecting, and correcting modifiable risk factors and hence controlling the major modifiable risk factors associated with these diseases. NCD BURDEN IN INDIA 2 In India, deaths from NCDs are projected to almost double fr om about 4.5 million in 1998 to 8 million by the year 2020. In the year 2005, 53% of all deaths were due to NCDs and this is projected to increase by 18% over the next 10 years. India leads the world presently with 35 million diabetic subjects and this fig ure is projected to increase to about 80 million by the year 2030 . Approximately 20% of world's diabetic population resides in India. It has been estimated that in India more than 2.4 million deaths are due to cardiovascular disease, which is approximately 25% of all the deaths, which is far greater than the deaths due to infectious diseases like diarrhoea, respiratory infection and tuberculosis. In about 15 years, India is expected to lead the world in Cardiovascular mortality . Various epidemiological stud ies in the Indian subcontinent have indicated a rising trend in the prevalence of hypertension, which ranges between 20 - 36%. Annually around 70 new cancer cases are detected for every 100, 000 populations in India and in any given year, there are almost 15 lakh cancer patients. NCDs AND AYURVEDA The main objective of Ayurveda is to \"Maintain the health of a healthy individual by prevention of disease and to cure the diseased ones 3 .\" Ayurveda being the foremost life science describes ways to prevent and m anage lifestyle disorders . It provides proper dietary management and lifestyle advic es through Dinacharya (daily regimen), Ritucharya (seasonal regimen), Panchakarma ( B io - purification therapies), and Rasayana (rejuvenation) therapies. The Sadvritta (ideal routines) and Aachara Rasayana (code of conduct) are of utmost importan ce to maintain a healthy and happy socio - psychological well being of a person . 1 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs355/en/ on 15 - 12 - 2015 2 http://ncd.in/need.html on 15 - 12 - 2015 3 Agnivesha 's Charaka Samhita, Sutrasthana. 2 INTEGRATION OF AYUSH (AYURVEDA) WITH NATIONAL PROGRAM FOR PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF CANCER, DIABETE S, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND STROKE (NPCDCS) To prevent and contain the projected increase in the burden of Non - Communicable Diseases, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, has launched the National Programme for Prevention and Cont rol of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke (NPCD CS) i n 2008 on pilot basis and thereafter in July , 2010 in 21 states during the year 2010 - 12 with the aim of health promotion; prevention and control of NCDs through early screening 4 . The we stern system of medicine is looking towards Complementary and Alternative systems of medicine (CAMs) for the manage ment of these alarming problem s . In this endeavour, Ayurveda, the age old indigenous system of health care that primarily focuses on preventi on of diseases through life style modifications and interventions (based on the fundamental concepts) can play an important role in prevention, control and treatment of NCDs (Diabetes and its complications, Hypertension ) and management of risk factors like High lipid levels etc. As per the NPCDCS programme, Integration of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha & Homoeopathy) for prevention and health promotion is one of its mandate. Moreover, integration of Ayurveda can also provide cost - effective management of NCDs, as these conditions require lifelong management and strengthen the primary healthcare network in order to ensure the success of its action plan. 4 A Guide for Health workers , Developed for NPCDCS Pr ogramme Dte.GHS, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, G ovt. of I ndia 3 OBJECTIVES To i ntegrat e Ayurveda to the existing healthcare system for promotion, pre vention and control of non - communicable diseases through NPCDCS program.

Patients with high blood sugar levels typically experience frequent urination (polyuria), increased thirst ( and exhaustion . EPIDEMIOLOGY In 2000, India (31.7 million) followed by China (20.8 million) topped the world with the highest number of people with D iabetes mellitus . Its prevalence is predicted to double globally from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030 with a maximum increase in India to an extent that by 2030 Diabetes mel litus may afflict up to 79.4 million individuals in India . 5 TYPES Diabetes is due to either the Pancreas not producing enough insulin or the cells of the body not responding properly to the insulin produced. There are three main types of Diabetes mellitus: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) results fro m the pancreas failure to produce enough insulin. This form was previously referred to as \" Insulin - Dependent Diabetes Mellitus \" (IDDM) or \"juvenile d iabetes\". The cause is unknown. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is the commonest type of Diabetes which occ urs usually after thirties . It begins with insulin resistance , a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly. As the disease progresses a lack of insuli n may also develop. This form was previously referred to as \" Non Insulin - Dependent Diabetes Mellitus \" (NIDDM) or \" Adult - o nset Diabetes \". Type 2 diabetes is due primarily to lifestyle factors and genetics. The primary cause is excessive body weight and not enough exercise. Gestational Diabetes (GD) mellitus resembles type 2 diabetes in several respects, but occurs during pregnancy. It occurs in about 2 - 10% of all pregnancies and may improve or disappear after delivery. However, after pregnancy approximatel y 5 - 10% of women suffering from Gestational diabetes are found to have Diabetes mellitus, most commonly type 2. Gestational diabetes is fully treatable, but requires careful medical supervision throughout the pregnancy. Management may include dietary changes, blood glucose monitoring, and in some cases insulin may be required. Pre - diabetes indicates a condition that occurs when a person's blood glucose levels are high er than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 DM. 5 Seema Abhijeet Kaveeshwar and Jon Cornwall ; The current state of diabetes mellitus in India; Australasian Medical Journal 2014; 7(1): 45 - 48. 13 RISK FACTOR S FOR DIABETES 6 \"One of every four people with diabetes doesn't know they have it\" 7 Type 1: U sually starts in childhood because P ancreas stops ma king insulin . The main c a u ses are : Familial predisposition Diseases of the pancreas Some rare Infection or illness Type 2: usually affects adults, but can begin at any time of life. The main causative factors are: Age - Above 3 5 years Low levels of HDL (\"good\") cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides Obesity or being overweight Sedentary lifestyle Family history Psychological factors (Stress, Depres sion etc.) Polycystic O vary syndrome Impaired glucose tolerance COMMON SYMPTOMS OF DIABETES \u0000 Frequent urination (Polyuria) \u0000 Sudden vision changes \u0000 Unexplained weight loss - even after eating frequently \u0000 Feeling of tired ness \u0000 Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet \u0000 More infections than usual \u0000 Wounds that are slow to heal \u0000 Fatigue 6 http://www.webmd.com/dia betes/risk - facto rs - for - diabetes 7 www.cdc.gov/features/ diabetes factsheet/ 14 Table 1.

Initial assessment of individuals suspected of having T2DM ne eds to include a risk assessment consisting of: History and physical examination; Assessment of blood glucose level; Presence of C ardiovasular D isease risk factors (lipid profile); and End - organ damage (P rotein uria /ECG/fundus examination). Modification of lifestyle is an important aspect of the management of all types of diabetes. The patient may be educated for - Lifestyle interventions Cessation of smoking Exercise and physical activity Healthy eating TARGETS OF CONTROL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES 10 F asting blood glucose 80 - 120 mg/dl Post meal blood glucose <160 mg/dl HbA1c < 7 % Note : After 40 years, blood sugar should be checked regularly. If a person is overweight, the blood sugar level should be checked even before the age of 40 years . 8 Endocrinology and Metabolism (Part 15), Section 1 - Endocrinology, Diabetes mellitus, Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 17 th Edition, Vol. II, Year 2008, pg.2277. 9 Type 2 Diabetes Screening and Treatment Guideline; Group Health Cooperative; Last guideline approval: June 2015. 10 Guidelines for Medical Officers, Prevention and Management of Cardiovascular diseases, Diabetes and Stroke, Center for Chroni c Disease Control, Public He alth Foundation of India, Developed for NPCDCS Programme under GOI - WHO collaborative programme (2008 - 09), Prevention and Management of Diabetes, page no. 44, August, 2009. 15 Complicat ions of Diabetes Cardiovascular disease(Angiopathy) Nerve damage (Neuropathy).

Diabetic Foot ulcer Skin infections Acute emergencies like Diabetic ketoacidosis Non ketotic hyperosmolar diabetic coma Hypoglycemia/ Hyperglycaemia Diabetic coma Respiratory infections DIABETES IN AYURVEDA Prameha is a disease caused by vitiation of Kapha & Meda . Total twenty types of Prameha have been described in three broad groups i.e. Vataj, Pittaj and Kaphaj pram ehas. The cardinal symptom s of Prameha are described as \" Prabhutavil a Mutrata 11 ( Excessive and/or turbid urine) \" . Prameha is of two types (1) Sahaj (Hereditary) and (2) Apathya nimittaja (caused by lifestyle). Madhumeha is considered as a subtype of Vataja Prameha . Specific laksh a na of have described as \" Mutre abhidhavanti p ipalikashcha 12 (Glycosuria may be detected by attraction of ants towards urine ) \" . The level of sugar in blood rises above the normal levels and sugar may also be detected in urine. Diabetes is also considered a s a M aharoga (major disease) because it affects most of the systems of the body. Causes of Madhumeha: 1 . Excessive sleeping ( Swapna sukham sukham ) . Excessive intake of carbohydrate rich diet especially newly harvested for e.g. rice, m aida etc. (Nava - annapana) 4 . Excessive or regular intake of fried or oily food items . 5 . Psychological factors li ke fear, grief, anger etc . 6 . Children of parents suffering from Madhumeha are more likely to have this disease. Symptoms: E xcessive and frequent urination (Prabhuta m utrata) Passing of turbid urine (Avila m utrata) Excessive thirst ( Pipasa - Trishana ) and hu the hands (Hasta AS PER AYURVEDA Do's (Pathya) Regula r exercis e especially walking. Timely intake of diet. Intake of old harvested cereal s, barley ( Yava ) , Blackberry ( Jamun ) etc. may be useful . Reduce intake of rice , food rich in carbohydrate and fried or processed food . Regular practice of Yoga, Meditation etc. under the supervision of Yoga specialist is suggested . Don'ts (Apathya) S ugarcane juice, jaggery, sugar, milk products. S edentary lifestyle. Sleep ing in the day time and e xcessive sleeping Alcohol S tay ing too long on empty stomach. C old drinks, Ice cream, burger - pizza and other fast foods etc. The role of ahara (dietary regimen) & vihara (lifestyle) are equally or even more important in diabetes t o control blood sugar level as well as to prevent complications of this disease. Common complications of Diabetes (Madhumeha) 13 as per Ayurveda Excessive with Diabetes have twice the risk of developing CVD as the general population. The prevalence rate of stroke can be up to five tim es greater, and prevalence of heart attack up to ten times greater, for people with diabetes than for those without diabetes. 14 Guidelines for management of Pre - Diabetes & Diabetes for Ayurveda integration with NPCDCS Note : F rom any of the two groups of P re - diabetes , if inspite of the management the patient shows persistently high blood sugar level i.e. FBS >125 mg/dL or PPBS >199 mg/dL , the patient may be shifted to Diabetes group and managed accordingly. From any of the two groups of Diabetes , if inspite of the treatment, the patient does not respond to the treatment or develops any complications, he/she may be referred to a proper set up. YOGIC MANAGEMENT ANNEXURE - VI The Yogic practices are found to be useful i n the management of Diabetes mellitus through various research studies. The aim of the Yogic treatment in the m anagement of diabetes is twofold: a . To stimulate the pancreatic cells to produce adequate amount of Insulin b . To reduce the Insulin resistance In gen eral, the practices prescribed for the Diabetic patients are as under: Kriyas : Pre - diabetic (with or without associated illness) (FBS = 100 - 125 mg/dL PPBS = 140 - 199 mg/dL) If Yes , then treat either as in Group A - 1 or A - 2 Group A - 1 Lifestyle modification s Yogic practices (In consultation with Yoga Instructor) Group A - 2 Ayurvedic medicine + Lifestyle modification s Yogic practices Group B - 1 Lifestyle modification s Yogic practices Conventional treatment Group B - 2 Ayurvedic medicine + Lifestyle modification s Yogic practices Conventional treatment Diabetic (with or without complication) (FBS > 12 5 mg/dL PPBS > 199 mg/dL) If Yes , then treat either as in Grou p B - 1 or B - 2 18 CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES Cardiovascular d iseases 15 (CVDs) refer to a group of disorders/ ailments that affect the heart and the blood vessels . CVD s include: Coronary heart disease Disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle Cerebro - vascular disease Disease of the blood vessels sup plying the brain Peripheral arterial disease Disease of blood vessels supplying the arms and legs Rheumatic heart disease Damage to the heart muscle and heart valves from rheumatic fever, caused by streptococcal bacteria Congenital heart disease M alformations of heart structure existing at birth Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism Blood clots in the leg veins, which can dislodge and move to the heart and lungs Atherosclerosis is caused by a buildup of plaque (made up of fat, cholestero l and other substances found in the blood) in a person's arteries; this buildup can accumulate to the point that a clot forms and clogs the artery completely, leading to either a stroke or a heart attack. The site of the plaque determines the type of heart disease. RISK FACTORS Major risk factors associated with CVD that cannot be modified include : Advancing age Genetic predisposition 15 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs317/en/index.htm l 19 Modifiable risk factors include : Behavioral factors such as tobacco, smoking Insufficient physical activity Exces sive alcohol consumption. High blood pressure High blood cholesterol Hyper triglyceridemia Overweight Note: People with diabetes have twice the risk of developing CVD as the general population. The prevalence rate of stroke can be up to five times grea ter, and prevalence of heart attack up to ten times greater, for people with diabetes than for those without diabetes. 16 PREVENTION OF CVDS At least 80% of premature deaths from heart disease and stroke could be avoided through Regular physical activity an d Eat healthy food: A low - fat, high - fiber diet Whole grains and fruit and vegetables Eating at least five servings of fruit and vegetables Limiting salt intake to less than one teaspoon/day Engage in physical activity Engaging in physical activity for at least 30 minutes every day of the week will help to prevent heart attacks and strokes. Maintain an ideal body weight . Stop tobacco, alcohol, smoking Reduce sugar consumption, psychosocial stress Check blood pressure and cholesterol regularly Minim ize risk by controlling blood pressure and blood sugar. 16 http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/chronic - cardio 20 HYPERTENSION ( \u0000 \u0000 ) INTRODUCTION Hypertension 17 is a condition when, blood flows through the blood vessels with a force greater than normal. It is also called High blood pressure . Blood pressure may be different at different times of the day. It is usually higher when individuals first wake up, after exercise, or under stress. Having higher blood pressure for short intervals of time is normal. However, when blood pressure stays high for a longer duration, it can cause serious health problems. It can strain the hea rt, damage blood vessels, and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney problems, and even lead to death. EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HYPERTENSION Hypertension (HTN) exerts a substantial public health burden on cardiovascular health status and healthcare sys tems in India. HTN is directly responsible for 57% of all stroke deaths and 24% of all coronary heart disease (CHD) deaths in India 18 . In an analysis of worldwide data for the global burden of HTN, 20.6% of Indian men and 20.9% of Indian women were sufferin g from HTN in 2005. The rates for HTN in percentage are projected to go up to 22.9 and 23.6 for Indian men and women, respectively by 2025. Recent studies from India have shown the prevalence of HTN to be 25% in urban and 10% in rural people in India. 19 TYP ES OF HYPERTENSION Based on the etiology, high blood pressure is classified as either primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension. Primary/Essential Hypertension Primary or \"essential\" hypertension has no known cause, however many of the li festyle factors contribute to this condition. About 90 - 95% of cases of hypertension are categorized as primary hypertension with no obvious underlying cause. Secondary Hypertension Secondary hypertension is caused by some other medical conditions/problem s or the use of certain medications. Incidence of Secondary hypertension is comparatively very low . The causes of secondary hypertension include: Kidney diseases (Reno - vascular disease and Chronic renal disease etc.) are the most common secondary cause of Hy Pregnancy, Use of contraceptive pills etc. 17 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0024201/ 18 Gupta R ;Trends in hypertension epidemiology in India; J Hum Hypertens. 2004 Feb;18(2):73 - 8 19 Debaprasad Chakrabarti et. al.;Prevalence, Awareness and Control of Hypertension in Rural Population of Tripura Jour nal of Evidence Based Medicine & Healthcare Vol. 2;Issue 50; Nov. 2015; Page: 8575 - 8578 21 RISK FACTORS FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE Age Lack of physical activity (or sedentary lifestyle) Excess alcohol consumption Smoking Being overweight or Obese High sodium intake/high salt intake Processed and fatty foods Stress Family history of High blood pressure SYMPTOMS OF HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS 20 W hen blood pressure readings r ise to dangerously high levels (systolic 180 or higher OR diastolic 110 or higher) , it is known as hypertensive crisis , and emergency medical treatment is needed. A person in hypertensive crisis may experience : Severe headaches Severe anxiety Shortness of breath Bleeding from nose CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSING HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE 21 The diagnosis of hypertension should be based on multiple BP measurements taken on several separate occasions e.g. at least twice at an interval of 10 - 15 days . The classification provided in the table below is based on consistent elevation during two or more properly measured BP readings in sitting position.

C omplicated cases may be referred to district level. DRUG THERAPY Whether a person requires allopathic medicines for his high blood pressure and which medicine is best for the patient would depend on: Th e blood pressure reading Whether the high blood pressure has already affected target organs in the body such as heart, kidneys, eyes and arteries Concurrent medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease and other risk factors like us e of tobacco, obesity and hyperlipidemia (lipid profile) etc. Other considerations will be age, gender (male/female) 23 and body weight.

From any of the two groups of hype rt ension , if inspite of the treatment, the patient does not respond to the treatment or develops any complications, he/she may be referred to a proper set up. Regular physical activity: All patients should be advised to become physically active, as part of a comprehensive plan to control hypertension, regardless of drug treatment. Smoking cessation may not directly reduce BP, but markedly reduces overall cardiovascular risk. The risk of myocardial infarction and stroke is higher in people who smoke than in non - smokers. Dietary salt restriction: 1 teaspoon /day /person . Recommend low - salt and reduced - salt foods as part of a healthy eating pattern. Dietary modification: A healthy eating pattern includes mainly plant - based foods e.g. fruits, vegetables, pulses and a wide selection of wholegrain foods, moderate amounts of low - fat or reduced - fat dairy products, moderate amounts of lean unprocessed meats, poultry and fish, moderate amounts of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats (e.g. olive oil) Weight reducti on: Reduction in body weight lowers systolic BP.

Concentrate mo re on pranayama and meditation than the other practices. 27 OVERWEIGHT , OBESITY & DYSLIPIDEMIA ( \u0000\u0000 ) INTRODUCTION Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat gets accumu lated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health, leading to reduced life expectancy and/or increased health problems. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases , particularly heart disease , type 2 diabetes , obstructive sleep apnea , certain types of cancer , and osteoarthritis . It is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food energy intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility , although a few cases are caused primarily by genes , endocrine disorders, medications , or psychiatric illness . 26 EPIDEMIOLOGY & HEALTH ASSOCIATED RISKS Current estimates suggest that the global prevalence of obesity has increased by two fold from 1980 to 2014 . 27 A major proportion of Diabetes, Ischemic Heart Disease, Hypertension, Ischemic Stroke , Osteoarthritis , and Cancer burden may be attribut ed to Overweight and Obesity . 28 CAUSES & RISKS FACTORS FOR OVERWEIGHT/OBESITY Increased intake of energy - dense foods that are high in fat, carbohydrates Overeating and Irregular food habits Lack of Physical activities due to se dentary life style Genetics, Medical Reasons or Psychiatric illness Day - time sleeping ASSESSING OVERWEIGHT/OBESITY According to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) , Overweight and Obesity are assessed using Body Mass Index (BMI) . It is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his / her height in meters (kg/m 2 ). It is used because, for most people, BMI correlates with their proportion of body fat, as a person having BMI of 25 to 29.9kg/m 2 is consi dered 'Overweight' and 'Obesity' as a BMI of 30kg/m 2 or more 29 . This classification accords with that recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). 30 Classification of overweight and obesity among adults 31 : Classification BMI (kg/m2) Risk of co - morbidit ies Underweight Less than 18.5 Low (but risk of other clinical problems increased) Healthy weight 18.5 - 24.9 Average Overweight (or pre - obese) 25 - 29.9 Increased Obesity, class I 30 - 34.9 Moderate Obesity, class II 35 - 39.9 Severe Obesity, class III (sev erely or morbidly obese) 40 or more Very severe 26 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity 27 World Health Organization.

Therefore, waist circumference should also be used in addition to BMI to measure Central obesity and disease risk in individuals with a BMI less than 35kg/m 2 . However, where BMI is greater than 35kg/m 2 , waist circumference adds little to the absolute measure of risk provided by BMI. Waist circumference thresholds used to assess health risks in the general population 32 At increased risk Male Female Increased risk 94 cm (37 inches) or more 80 cm (31 inches) or more Greatly increased risk 102 cm (40 inches) or more 88 cm (35 inches) or more The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that an individual's relative health risk could be more accurately classified using both BMI and waist circumference.

There are a number of different forms of Dyslipidemia. Hypercholesterolemia indicates elevated blood cholesterol levels. Hyper - triglyceridemia implies eleva ted triglycerides (TGs). Hyper - lipidemia indicates elevated cholesterol and TGs that is, an elevation of lipids in the blood. Dyslipidemia is one of the life style disorders due to the today's faulty life style. It may be manifested by elevation of the Tot al cholesterol, the bad Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and /or the rise in triglyceride concentrations and a decrease in the good High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration in the blood. Dyslipidemia is widely regarded as a major ri sk factor for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD); for every 1% increase in cholesterol level there is 1 - 2% increase in the incidence of CHD. 35 35 ijapr.in/articles/research/fulltext/2714136.pdf 30 Predisposing factors Heredity/Genetic Advanced age Gender (women ge nerally have lower total cholesterol levels than men of the same age before menopause) Cigarette smoking Excessive alcohol consumption Diet high in saturated fats, trans - fatty acids, and cholesterol and diet low in fiber Physical inactivity Overweight or obesity (especially abdominal obesity) Certain medications ( e.g. , beta blockers, diuretics) Anabolic steroids Diabetes mellitus Hypothyroidism Table 1.

It is considered as one of Santarpanottha Vikaras (disease due to over calories) in Ayurveda. Medodushti (disorders of fat metabolism) may be one of the risk factors for Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD). Lipids can be easily co - related to that of Medo Dhat u . Abnormal composition of Medo Dhatu as Medo Dosha and subsequently as Medoroga . It is a condition caused by derangement of Agni in general and Medodhatvagni in particular leading to improper formation of Medo Dhatu in excess, which subseque ntly starts accumulating in the Srotas resulting into obstruction to the flow of Vata, in turn aggravating the Vata d osha which moves back into the Pakvashaya causing further excitation of Agni requiring frequent meals thus the vicious cycle continue s resu lting into Medoroga . Causes: 1 . Sedentary lifestyle . Excessive and frequent intake of food. 3 . Excessive intake of oily, sweet, cold, heavy food items. 4 . Lack of physical and mental activity / Lack of exercise. 5 . Day sleeping. 6 . Children of obese parents are likely to be obese. Symptoms: 1 . Breathlessness even on little exertion / physical activity. 2 . Lack of interest in doing work. 3 . Profuse sweating with foul body odor . 4 . Excessive hunger. 5 . Feeling of tiredness. 6 . Excessive sleep. Do's: 1 . Intake of regular and balanced diet . 2 . Use of lukewarm water ( Ushnodaka ) gram Kul Red Gram ( Arhar ) 5 . Plenty of green leafy vegetables and fruits 6 . Fibrous food items 7 . Brisk walking and jogging in fresh air everyday in early morning 8 . Regular exerci se 9 . Practice of Yoga & Naturopathy in consultation with the specialist 38 33 Don'ts: 1 .

This is to be done under the supervision of Yoga Instructor (in consulta tio n with Ayurvedic Physician). In general, the practices prescribed for the Obesity 39 cases are: Kriyas and relaxation techniques viz. Instant relaxation technique (IRT), quick relaxation technique (QRT), deep relaxation tec hnique (DRT) and cyclic meditation (CM). 39 A study of Efficacy and Mechanisms of Uni - Nostril Yoga Breathing and Obesity, Research project of Central Council for Research in Yoga & Naturopathy Deptt. Of AYUSH, Ministry of H ealth and Family Welfare, 2009 34 STROKE Stroke is a brain injury caused by a sudden interruption in the blood supply of the brain. It occurs when part of the brain does not receive the needed blood flow for one of two reaso ns i.e. either the blood supply to a part of the brain is suddenly interrupted, or a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and blood invades the surrounding areas. INCIDENCE Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in India. The estimated adjusted prevalence rate of stroke range s , 84 - 262/100,000 in rural and 334 - 424/100,000 in urban areas. The incidence rate is 119 - 145/100,000 based on the recent population based studies. 40 RISK FACTORS 41 There are 2 types of risk factors for stroke: controll able and uncontrollable . Controllable risk factors generally fall into two categories: lifestyle risk factors or medical risk factors. Lifestyle risk factors can often be changed, while medical risk factors can usually be treated. Controllable Risk Factors Uncontrollable Risk Factors Stroke symptoms /Identification of an acute event 43 SUDDEN numbness or weakness of face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body S UDDEN confusion, trouble speaking, or understanding SUDDEN trouble seeing in one or both eyes SUDDEN trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination SUDDEN severe headache with no known cause 40 Pandian and Sudhan; Stroke epidemiology and stroke care services in India; Journal of Stroke. 2013 Sep;15(3):128 - 34. 41 Miss.B.M.Gund et . al.; Stroke: A Brain Attack; IOSR Journal Of Pharmacy; Volume 3, Issue 8 (September 2013), pp 01 - 23 42 Peter Appelros et. al.; Sex Differences in Stroke stroke/signs - and - symptoms - stroke Controllable Disease conditions that Increase s Stroke Risk High Blood Pressure Atherosclerosis Atrial Fibrillation Diabetes mellitus Hypercholesterolemia Lifestyle Risk Factors that c an b e c hanged Tobacco u se and Smoking Alcohol Use Physical Inactivity Obesity Age Gender 42 Race Family History Previous Stroke or TIA 35 Use FAST to Remember the Warning Signs of a Stroke 44 FACE : Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop? ARMS : Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward? SPEECH : Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. Is the speech slurred or strange? TIME : If an y of these signs is observed, seek medical care immediately. PREVENTION 1 . Identify and review the risk factors . 2 . Reduce the risk factors through lifestyle changes 3 . Recognize the signs and symptoms of a stroke ( by \" FAST\" as given above ) and r espond immediat ely. 4 . Eating a healthy diet 5 . Maintaining a healthy weight 6 . Getting enough exercise 7 . Not smoking 8 . Avoid alcohol 9 . Check Cholesterol 10 . Control Blood Pressure 11 . Manage Heart Disease Sequel of stroke may be Hemiplegia / Hemiparesis , which is described as \" P AKSHAGHAT \" in A yurveda . Pakshaghat in Ayurveda : Aggravated Vata d osha affects either side of the body, paralyzing motor and / or sensory functions of the limbs, causing Pakshaghat. Usually right half / left half or lower half of the body is affected. Signs & Symptoms L imping gait / difficulty in speech / tickle of fluid while drinking sometimes Numbness / pain of affected part of the body Loss of motor functions / activities Loss of sensation sometimes Do's: Masha (Black Gram), Kulattha (Horse Gram), Palandu Kushmanda (Ash Mudga like Dadima (Pomegranate), Amra (Mango), Draksha (Grape), etc., can also be taken. 44 http://www.stroke.org/understand - stroke/recognizing - stroke/act - fast 36 Don'ts: Pungent and astringent or salty food an d incompatible diet. Excess consumption of chana, peas, barley etc. Excessive starvation, Excess exercises, Suppressing of natural urges, awakening in the nights. Excessive consumption of alcohol and smoking. Management: - VI This is to be done under the supervision of Yoga Instructor (in consulta tion with Ayurvedic Physician). In general, the practic es prescribed for the Stroke cases are: (as applicable according to the patient's condition and in consultation with physician ) and relaxation techniques viz. Instant relaxation technique (IRT), quick relaxation technique (QRT), deep relaxation technique (DRT) and cyclic meditation (CM). 37 CANCER ( \u0000 \u0000 ) Cancer is the second leading cause of death after heart disease s . The carcinogenic agents that people breathe, eat, drink and are otherwise exposed to, largely determine the occurrence of the disease. The common causative factors include toba cco use, being overweight or obese, unhealthy diet with low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, alcohol use, sexually transmitted HPV - infection, infection by HBV, ionizing and non - ionizing radiation, urban air pollution, smoke (indoor or industrial) etc . Tobacco use is the single most important risk factor for cancer causing about 20% of global cancer deaths and around 70% of global lung cancer deaths. 45 The high rates of cervical and breast cancers have created a higher cancer burden in women than men and hence these diseases are of major societal and familial consequence. Probable Signs for early detect ion of Cancer (CAUTION) : C hange in bowel or bladder habits A sore that does not heal U nusual bleeding or discharge T hickening or lump in the breast or elsewhere I ndigestion or difficulty in swallowing O bvious change in a wart or mole N agging cough or hoarseness of voice Cancer can be treated successfully if detected early. Screening is a means of early detect ion of the disease in asymptomat ic individuals with the goal of decreasing morbidity and mortality. Screening can potentially save lives as shown in cervical, and breast cancer. Public education on the avoidance of identified risk factors for cancer and encouraging healthy habits contrib utes to its prevention and control. 46 The social origin of lifestyle must also be considered in cancer prevention. It is now known that over one - third of cancers are preventable, and one - third potentially curable provided they are diagnosed early in their course. The quality of life of patients with incurable disease can be improved with palliative care. 47 General measures for prevention of Cancer Stop using tobacco in all forms Avoid consuming alcohol Adopt healthy food habits Choose predominantly plant b ased diets rich in fruits and vegetables Restrict the intake of red - meat (beef, pork etc. ) and preserved meat Engage in regular physical activity Maintain optimum weight for height and age 45 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/fa ctsheets/fs297/en/ 46 Oncology and Hematology (Part 6), Prevention and Early Detection of Cancer, Education and Healthful habits, Harrison's Princi ples of Internal Medicine, 17 th Edition, Vol. I, Year 2008, pg.486. 47 M.

Aggravated Vata and Kapha d oshas affect the tissues resulting in development of a round, firm, large, deep rooted, slow growing fleshy growth associated with mild pain. 6 types of tumors have been described in Ayurveda based on the aggravated Dosha and the tissue involved viz. Among these Mamsarbuda and Raktarbuda are described as incurable. 48 ORAL CANCER Oral cancer is one of the most common cancers in India. Chewing tobacco is the major cause for Oral cancer . Smoking and alcohol consumption are powerful and synergistic risk factors for the development of oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( SCC ) . Hea vy drinkers and smokers have 38 times greater risk than the abstainers 49 . Incidence Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma is the 6 th most common cancer globally and its incidence is increasing . The burden of oral cavity SCC varies significantly with cultural variati ons . India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have the highest incidence with up to 25% of all new cancers affecting the oral cavity . Signs & Symptoms Raised white or red patch/ sloughing ulcer/ hard mass Pain/ difficulty in opening mouth or swallowing Lump in the neck Numbness of the tongue or other area of the mouth Change in voice quality/Hoarseness of voice Screening strategy for Oral cancer Examine the interior of the mouth regularly to detect symptoms early . Examination of the mouth Examine the inte riors of the mouth i.e., inside of cheeks and lips, the floor and roof of the mouth, the tongue and the lymph nodes in the neck, standing before a mirror in adequate light, for any red or white patch, or any other abnormal area. Feel the suspicious area wi th fingers to know its hardness and extent of spread. 48 Sushruta Samhita, Nidansthana 49 Blot WJ, McLaughlin JK, Winn DM, Austin DF, Greenberg RS, Preston Martin S. Smoking and drinking in relation to oral and phar yngeal cancer. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3282 - 3287. 39 Oral Cancer Diagnostic Tests 50 After thorough examination, if symptoms indicate cancer, then suspect oral cancer. One or more of the following tests may be used to confirm cancer and its spread. Biopsy A small tissue sample is taken for histo - pathological examination. Biopsy is the only sure way to know if the abnormal area is Cancer . Brush biopsy or Exfoliative cytology, or Chemil uminescent light are some of the biopsy techniques. Oral Cancer Prevention Cancers of the mouth are among the most preventable cancers. To minimize the risk of developing oral cancer: Do's: Eat a well - balanced, healthy diet with a variety of fruits and v egetables Examination of dentures by a dentist at least every five years Remove the dentures at night and clean them daily Wear a lip balm with sunscreen and a hat with a brim to limit sun exposure Don'ts: Tobacco in all forms. Drinking alcohol. BREAS T CANCER Breast cancer is a malignant proliferation of epithelial cells lining the ducts or lobules of the breast. Breast cancer is a hormone dependent disease. Women without functioning ovaries who never receive Oestrogen replacement therapy may not devel op breast cancer. 51 Incidence India is experiencing an unprecedented rise in the number of breast cancer cases across all sections of society, as are also other countries. Presently, India already has one of the worst survivals from breast 50 http://www.mdanderson.org/patient - and - cancer - information /cancer - information/cancer - types/oral - cancer/diagnosis/index.html 51 Oncology and Hematology (Part 6), Breast cancer, ..... and Epidemiology, Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 17 th Edition, Vol. I, Year 2008, pg.563 . 40 cancer, in the wo rld; has the highest number of women dying from breast cancer in the world; and India ranks number one in the numbers of healthy life years lost (DALY - Disability Adjusted Life Years) due to breast cancer. 52 Symptoms 53 Presence of any palpable mass/nodule i n the breast(s) which are hard, irregular, tethered or fixed, or painless Abnormal skin changes or retractions over the breast or nipple discharges Enlargement or Inflammation in the regional lymph node s Screening strategy for Breast Cancer 54 Breast self - e xamination (BSE) - monthly (preferably during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle i.e. days 5 - 7 of the cycle are the best time for the breast examination ) Clinical breast examination by a care giver Mammography Regular Self - examination increases the likelihood of detecting a mass at a smaller size when it can be treated with more limited surgery. Self - examination leads to increased biopsy rate though it does not itself reduce breast cancer. Diagnostic Tests Mammography Biopsy - Aspiration Biopsy P revention Early detection can achieve a longer survival. The major benefit of BSE is identification of tumors appropriate for conservative local therapy. Breast cancer is virtually unique among the epithelial tumors in adults in that screening in the form of annual mammography improves survival. CERVICAL CANCER Veneral transmission of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is the etiological factor of Cervical cancer. Over 66 types of HPVs have been isolated, and many are associated with genital warts. Those types com monly associated with cervical carcinoma are 16, 18, 31, 33, 52 and 58, but 70% cases are caused by HPV - 16 and - 18. These along with many other types are also associated with Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN). 55 52 http://www.breastcancerindia.net/statistics/stat_global.html 53 Oncology and Hematology (Part 6), Breast cancer, Evaluation Breast masses in Men and Women, The Palpable Breast Mass, Harriso n's Principles of Interna l Medicine, 17 th Edition, Vol. I, Year 2008, pg. 564. 54 Oncology and Hematology (Part 6), Breast cancer, Evaluation Breast masses in Men and Women, The Palpable Breast Mass, Harriso n's Principles of Internal Medicine, 17 th Edition, Vol. I, Year 2008, pg.56 4. 55 Oncology and Hematology (Part 6), Gynecologic Malignancies, Cervix Cancer, Etiology and Genetics, Harrison's Principles of In ternal Medicine, 17 th Edition, Vol. I, Year 2008, pg.608. 41 Incidence Worldwide cervical cancer is the third commonest cancer diagnosed. Cervical cancer is on the declining trend in India according to the population - based registries; yet it continues to be a major public health problem for women in India. The epidemiological risk factors are early ag e at marriage, multiple sexual partners, multiple pregnancies, poor genital hygiene, malnutrition, use of oral contraceptives, and lack of awareness 56 . Symptoms 57 Patients with Cervical cancer are generally asymptomatic, and the disease is detected on routin e pelvic examination. Abnormal bleeding or post coital spotting that may increase to inter - menstrual o r prominent menstrual bleeding Feeling of any mass per vaginum Yellowish vagi nal discharge Lumbo - sacral back pain Lower extremity edema Urinary symptoms Screening strategy In developed countries, screening for precancerous and cancerous cells using Pap tests has reduced cervical cancer development and death by 80%. However, in India and other developing countries, screening examinations like Pap tests an d Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing is not possible for most women, especially those living in rural areas, because of the cost, the need for a laboratory to get results, and a lack of trained health care workers. Pap smear test - The Pap smear is 90 - 95 % accurate in detecting early lesions such as Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) but is less sensitive in detecting cancer when frankly invasive cancer or fungating masses are present. Inflammation, necrosis and haemorrhage may produce false - positive smears, and colposcopic - directed biopsy is required when any lesion is visible on the cervix, regardless of Pap smear findings. 58 V isual Inspection with Acetic acid (V IA ) test - The VIA test is performed by applying vinegar to the cervix using a cotton swa b. After 60 seconds, the cervix is examined with the naked eye using a lamp. Precancerous tissue turns white when vinegar is applied, while healthy tissue does not change color. The results are known immediately, and the test can be done by primary health care workers . 59 Diagnostic tests 60 Colposcopic - directed Biopsy is a technique using a binocular microscope and 3% acetic acid applied to the cervix in which abnormal areas appear white and can be biopsied directly. 56 Aswathy Sreedevi et.al.

Cone Biopsy alone is therapeutic for CIN in many patients. Staging 61 Stage 0 - Carcinoma in situ Stage I - Disease confined to the cervix Stage II - Disease invades beyond the cervix but not to the pelvic wal l or lower third of the vagina Stage III - Di sease extends to the pelvic wall or lower third of the vagina or causes hydronephrosis Stage IV - Present when the tumor invades the mucosa of bladder or rectum or extends beyond the true pelvis Prevention strategy for cervical cancer Vaccination against pathologic HPV appears to be an effective Cervical cancer prevention strategy. Vaccines are made with inactivated virus like particles that are non - infecti o us but highly immunogenic. Since not all oncogenic HPVs are targeted, patients will need to continue Pap Smear surveillance. 62 HPV is necessary for the development of cervical cancer. Therefore, preventing HPV infection can prevent cervical cancer. This can be achieved by complete abstinence from sexual activity or by a vaccine 63 . Primary prevention involv es a risk reduction approach through behavioral intervention for sexual and health care - seeking behavior or through mass immunization against high - risk HPV. 64 Treatment Carcinoma in situ (Stage 0) can be managed successfully by cone biopsy or by abdominal hysterectomy. For Stage I disease, results appears equivalent for either hysterectomy or radiation therapy. Patients with disease stages II - IV are primarily managed with external beam irradiation and intra - cavitary treatment or combined modality therapy. 65 Referral: A ll the cancers should be detected at the earliest and referred to proper set ups for early treatment.

RHD is the most common cardiovascular disease in children and young adults. If the damaged heart valves are not repaired or replaced by cardiac surgery, the condition may become fatal. Epidemiology RHD affects more t han 1.5 crore people worldwide and causes over 2.3 lakh deaths per year. India contributes to about 25% to 50% of newly diagnosed cases of RHD of the world. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had conducted school surveys in several parts of the country at different points of time; the data obtained from these studies shows decline in RHD prevalence in many States. The prevalence of RHD is estimated at 0.9 per 1000 children in the age - group of 5 - 14 years by the study. However, the prevalence of RH D in some parts of the country still remains high. RHD is widespread in low - income and overcrowded communities, where there is lack of hygiene and sanitation. RF and RHD have been nearly eradicated in developed countries, probably because of better living conditions, and better access to health care facilities. Pathogenesis Rheumatic Fever follows untreated infection with a bacterium called \"Group - A Beta Hemolytic Streptococcus\". Repeated episodes of Rheumatic Fever lead to worsening damage to the heart va lves and therefore early diagnosis of RHD is very important. Diagnosis 1 . Diagnosis of Streptococcal pharyngitis Symptoms of Streptococcal pharyngitis include pain in throat and difficulty in swallowing, usually associated with high fever and hoarseness of vo ice. These symptoms last for more than a week. Clinical examination reveals pus points over tonsils and swollen cervical lymph nodes. The final confirmation is however by throat swab culture positive for Group - A Streptococcus, high or rising Anti - Strepto lysin O titre, etc. 2 . Diagnosis of Rheumatic Fever Rheumatic Fever has very typical signs and symptoms. RF must be suspected in any child presenting with pain and swelling in large joints with or without fever, and with history of bacterial sore throat in th e recent past. Symptoms of breathlessness, palpitations, chest pain may accompany and are indicative of carditis due to Rheumatic Fever. Diagnosis of Rheumatic Fever is conventionally made using 'modified Jones criteria', which is a set of guidelines to a id clinicians. The Major and Minor criteria are as given in the table below : Major criteria Minor criteria Carditis: Clinical and/or PR interval, after accounting for age variability (unless carditis is a Rate 44 The following criteria are taken into account in Indian context for making diagnosis of RF: All patients must have evidence of preceding Streptococcal infection. This could be in the for m of positive throat culture for Group - A Streptococcus, high or rising anti - streptolysin O titre or other Streptococcal antibodies (anti - DNASE B). For diagnosing first episode of RF: o Two Major criteria or, o One Major plus two Minor criteria For diagnosin g recurrence of RF: o Two Major criteria or, o One Major plus two Minor criteria or, o Three Minor criteria 3 . Diagnosis of Rheumatic Heart Disease: History and physical examination are quite typical and therefore clinical diagnosis of RHD is generally quite obv ious. Common symptoms of RHD include breathlessness on exertion, tiredness, swelling of feet. Patients with severe valve disease may present with orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea and heart failure. Cardiac murmurs are hallmark of RHD. The investig ations like X - ray chest, ECG and Echocardiography further help to determine severity of the valve damage. Treatment and Prevention RHD can be prevented by prevention and management of Streptococcal pharyngitis and Rheumatic Fever. Streptococcus bacteria c an easily spread from person to person as it is highly contagious. The bacteria spread to other people through coughing and sneezing, by not washing one's hands, lack of hygiene, etc. Therefore, it is important to understand that RF can be prevented by tre ating streptococcal infections. Primary prevention : Primary prevention of RF (the prevention of initial attack) is recommended by treating the streptococcal throat infections by administering a single intramuscular injection of long acting Penicillin (Be nzathine Penicillin) or by oral antibiotic (usually Penicillin) for a period of 10 days. Secondary Prevention: Patients who develop one episode of RF following a streptococcal sore throat are at a much higher risk for developing further episodes of RF, if they develop recurrent throat infections. They need to receive preventive treatment with Penicillin injection for longer durations, so that RF does not recur. This is called as secondary prophylaxis. Secondary prophylaxis is recommended for all people who have a history of RF or RHD. 45 General preventive measures: Do's: Get regular check - ups at local health clinic Keep sores clean and covered Wash hands regularly Watch out for symptoms in children - people aged between 5 and 14 are most likely to get rheuma tic fever Eat a healthy diet Don'ts: Do not ignore a sore throat. Consult a doctor for proper treatment of sore throat. Do not to add further stress to the heart either by smoking of by being overweight . Referral: All the diagnosed and suspected cases of RHD should be referred to proper set ups for appropriate management.

It includes emphysema characterized by destruction and enlargement of lung alveoli and chronic bronchitis clinically defined by chronic cough and phlegm. Chronic bronchitis without air flow obstruction is not included in COPD 67 . The three most common symptoms in COPD are cough, sputum and exertional dyspnea. COPD often occurs along with a number of other conditions, due in part to share risk factors. These conditions include ischemic heart disease , high blood pressure , diabetes mellitus , muscle wasting, osteoporosis , lung cancer , anxiety disorder and depression . 68 INCIDENCE Worldwide, COPD affects 329 million people or nearly 5% of the population 69 . It became the third leading cause of death 70 . CAUSES Tobacco smoking Secondhand / passive smoking Air pollution Occupational exposures - (Chemical, Paint, Coal mining , Gold mining & Cotton text ile industry etc.) Genetics ( playing a smaller role ) Respiratory infections SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Shortness of breath / exertional dyspnea Productive cough Chest tightness Physical findings may include barrel chest, expiratory wheezing DIAGNOSIS Spir ometry Chest X - ray Complete blood count (CBC) 67 Harrisons Principles of Internal Medicine, Vol. II, 17 th Edition, Page No.1635. 68 Decramer M et.al.

TREATMENT The major goals of management are : T o reduce risk factors M anage stable COPD P reven t and treat acute exacerbations anage illnesses. Stopping smoking , vacc inations rehabilitation , and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids , Long - term antibiotics to reduce the frequency of exacerbations, long - term oxygen therapy, Pulmonary rehabilitation (a program of exercise), Nutritive diet to improve their breathing muscle strength, surgery ( lung transplantation or lung volume reduction surgery) for those with very severe disease. 71 From Pauwels et.al. in Harrisons Principles of Internal Medicine, Vol. II, 17 th Edition, 2008. 48 COPD IN AYURVEDA According to Ayurveda the vitiated Pranvayu combines with deranged Kapha dosha in the lungs causing obstruction in t he pranavaha srotasa (respiratory tract).This results in gasping, labored breathing and respiratory distress. This condition is called Swasa roga . ' Shwasa Roga ' is a disease of ' Pranavaha srotas ' (Tracheobronchial tree). The abnormal, rapid or difficult br eathing when present as a cardinal feature of a disease is called ' Shwasa roga '. When Prana Vayu get vitiated and becomes defiled, get obstructed by Kapha and moves in opposite direction i.e. upwards and unable to perform normal functions, this condition i s termed as Shwasa roga . 72 This closely resembles Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). COPD has been defined as a preventable and treatable disease with some significant extra - pulmonary effects that may contribute to the severity in individual pati ents. 73 CAUSES Consuming dry, heavy diet, excessive intake of cold water and cold drinks, intake of meals much more than the digesting capacity Expos ure to dust, smoke and cold air L iving in cold /damp are as T aking cold water bath Suppression of urges Ext ernal reasons like Injury of throat or chest, MANAGEMENT THROUGH AYURVEDA The sub acute and chronic cases can be managed through Ayurveda.

Development of these diseases and risk factors associated with the se can be prevented if healthy lifestyle is adopted. Therefore , it is important to educate people about the risk factors and prevent ive measures for the se diseases . Risk factors for Cancer, Diabetes, CVDs and Stroke and Their Prevention Behavioral Risk Factors Physiological Risk Factors Disease Outcomes Unhealthy Diet Physical Inactivity Tobacco Use Alcohol Use Stress BMI (Obesity) Blood Pressure Blood Glucose Cholesterol Weight loss Heart Disease Stroke Diabetes Cancer Primary Prevention Secondary Prevention Tertiary Prevention There is strong evidence that significant reduction can be achieved by introduction of simple public health interventions addressing major ri sk factors such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and use of tobacco & alcohol in any form f or Cancer, Diabetes, CVD s a nd Stroke . The general public is to be oriented to this fact that clinical treatment provides solutions at an individual level and only after the disease has developed while prevention can be started much earlier through life style changes . Public health measures such as proving information and education help to avert the disease itself and benefit and protect the entire population. D ifferent stakeholders, therefore, need to be oriented towards various prevention methods and approaches to reduce the burden of these diseases. It is important that primary prevention strategies should be targeted from childhood, preferably involv ing heal th education programmes at school levels . It should aim at promoting healthy diets, exercise and avoiding the use of tobacco & alcohol. Further, the primary prevention strategies may be complemented by basic provisions like availability of fresh fruits and vegetables in nearby areas, facilities for Physical activity/exercise and making the village or city smoke free etc. \"Integration\" is the act of combining or adding various parts to make a unified approach . The implementation of integrating various AYUSH systems with the main stream in the health sector is the need of the hour to achieve objective of improving health. Sharing of public health knowledge and skills by professionals in allopathic system of medicine and involvement of qualified and trained pe ople from Ayurveda, Yoga, and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) professionals may bring Health for All in India. Ayurveda practitioners can play an active role in catering health services grass root level with a strong preventive approach s o as to control NCDs to a greater extent. Ayurveda advocates healthy balanced food and life style with an individual istic approach with unique Philosophy of mind - body constitution and set of life circumstances. With appropriate use of Ayurvedic p reventive measures such as Dincharya, Ritucharya, Ahar vidhi and therapeutic measures most of the NCDs can be prevented at all levels and longevity can be achieved which is the target of Ayurveda i.e . Jivet Shardah Shatam .... 51 ANNEXURE - I STEPS FOR M EASURING BLOOD PRESSURE Blood pressure can be measured with the patient sitting on a chair with back straight or in lying down position. The patient should be seated for at least 5 minutes, in a relaxed manner. He/ She should not be moving or speaking. Th e arm must be supported at the level of the heart. Ensure no tight clothing constricts the arm. Place the cuff on at least 80% of the arm (but not more than 100%) on the upper left portion of arm neatly with the centre of the bladder over the brachial art ery. The bladder should encircle the arm. The column of mercury must be vertical, and at the observers eyes level. Rest the arm of the person on table so that the elbow of the person is parallel to heart. Wrap the blood pressure cuff around the arm slightl y above the crease of forearm. Place the stethoscope on the crease of the forearm and pump the blood pressure cuff up to 200 . The metal attachment on the side of the pump allows you to inflate and deflate the cuff. Estimate the systolic pressure by palpat ory method: Palpate the radial / brachial artery Inflate cuff until pulsation disappears Deflate cuff Estimate systolic pressure As you deflate the cuff, you will hear sounds (Korotkoff sounds) of different intensity. The first appearance of faint, repeti tive, clear tapping sounds, which gradually increase in intensity, measures the systolic blood pressure. The point at which all sounds finally disappear completely is the diastolic pressure. The blood pressure should be recorded as soon as it is measured. Normal blood pressure is 120/80 mm of Hg. 52 ANNEXURE - II CALCULATION OF BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) What is Body Mass Index (BMI)? Body Mass Index (BMI) is a number calculated from a person's weight and height. BMI is a fairly reliable indicator of body fatn ess for most people. Height & Weight measurement procedure The person should be asked to remove as much outerwear as possible and as per convenience. Regardless of the clothing worn, the person should be asked to remove his/her shoes/footwear. Additional ly, the person will be asked to empty his/her pockets and other objects like eyeglasses, mobile, keys, pocket diaries, wallet etc., if possible, so that accurate height and weight measurements can be obtained. Method for measurement of Weight The person should be asked to step up backwards onto the weighing machine and stand still over the center of the scale with body weight evenly distributed between both feet. In order to ensure confidentiality and to prevent the person from seeing his/her weight, it i s required that the person step on the scale backward facing away from the readout. The person 's arms should be hanging freely by the sides of the body, with palms facing the thighs. The person should hold his/her head up, and face forward. The reading on the weighing machine should be observed and recorded . Method for measurement of Height The person should be asked to stand with his/her back against the board/wall . The back, scapulae and buttocks are in contact with the vertical board /wall if possible , or whichever part of the body touches the board first. The weight of the person should be evenly distributed on both feet. The person should be asked to place the legs together, bringing the ankles or knees together, whichever comes together first (ofte n they will come together simultaneously). The person is instructed to stand erect (stand up straight and look straight ahead). The person 's position should be verified from both the FRONT and from the LEFT side of the body. The person 's head is positio ned in the Frankfort Horizontal Plane. In this position, an imaginary line can be drawn from the bottom of the eye socket (orbital margin) to the external opening of the ear (external auditory canal). The person should be asked to inhale deeply and hold h is/her breath while maintaining the head and body in the same position. Sometimes a person will either lift his/her head or pull up onto the toes 53 when taking the deep breath. If this happens, the measurer will need to re - position the body and head before t aking the measurement. The height measured should be recorded. What is Waist Circumference (WC)? Waist Circumference (WC) is an indirect measure of abdominal fat in the body. Waist can be measured using a non - stretchable fibre measure tape with the parti cipant standing erect in a relaxed position with both feet together and looking straight. Waist circumference measurement technique Accurate measurement of waist circumference is achieved using the following technique: Ensure that the patient is standin g erect and has relaxed the abdominal muscles. Measurement is taken at the end of normal expiration. Locate the top of the hip bone (iliac crest) and take the measurement just above this bony landmark, just where one finger can fit between the iliac crest and the lowest rib. Ensure that the tape measure is positioned horizontally, parallel to the floor. Measuring at a level just above the iliac crest, and positioning the tape horizontally, irrespective of whether the umbilicus is above or below the tape, p rovides the correct waist circumference measurement and should correspond to the maximal abdominal diameter. Tape should not be too tight or do not make compressions in the skin while measuring the waist. When measuring waist circumference it is important not to be tempted to measure around the narrower part of the abdomen situated below the umbilicus. Using the anatomical landmark of the iliac crest and ensuring that measurement is taken on a horizontal plane just above this level provides the most accurat e, reliable and reproducible technique for waist circumference measurement. 54 ANNEXURE - III BREAST SELF - EXAMINATION (BSE) Best time to do: Once a month. 10 days after your menstrual period. If not menstruating, pick a certain day - such as the first day of each month. If taking hormones then do it 1 - 2 days after withdrawal bleeding. Five Steps of Breast Self - Exam (BSE): Step 1: Stand in front of the mirror with your shoulders straight and your arms on your hips and look at your breasts for: (Breast aware ness) their usual size, shape and color whether they are evenly shaped without visible distortion or swelling Consult the doctor if there is: dimpling, puckering, or bulging of the skin changed position or an inverted nipple(pushed inward instead of stick ing out) redness, rash, or swelling of the breasts. Step 2: Now, raise your arms and look for the same changes. Look for any dimpling of skin or in - drawing nipple. Step 3: While you're at the mirror, gently squeeze each nipple between your finger an d thumb Consult the doctor if there is presence of milky/ yellow fluid or bloody nipple discharge. 55 Step 4: Lie down and use your right hand to feel your left breast and then your left hand to feel your right breast. Use a firm, smooth touch with the first few fingers of your hand, keeping the fingers flat and together. Cover the entire breast from top to bottom, side to side: from your collar bone to the top of your abdomen and from your armpit to your cleavage.
