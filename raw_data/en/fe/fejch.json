To measure this, the Census Bureau produced the Community Resilience Estimates (CRE). To provide context to the estimates and add to the discussion of equity, the CRE program has created the Community Resilience Estimates Equity Supplement or CRE for Equity. The CRE for Equity dataset provides information about the nation, states, counties, and census tracts from four different data sources. These sources include the Community Resilience Estimates, the American Community Survey, the Decennial Census, and the Census Bureau's Planning Database. Providing all this information in one dataset allows users quick access to the data on a variety of topics concerning social vulnerability and equity. "}
