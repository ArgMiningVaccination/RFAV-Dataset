Ayurveda is an ancient Indian medical science, which specialises in treating chronic diseases. It also aims to maintain a healthy body, mind and spirit. A healthy person should follow the right dincharya (daily routine), adapt to seasonal changes and eat a nutritious diet to avoid any disease. From time immemorial, modern medicine is trying to find solutions for long-term chronic problems such as psoriasis, high cholesterol, AIDS and paralysis. There has been tremendous interest in the field of Ayurveda and its capabilities in treating such disorders. For chronic diseases the answer lies with Ayurveda and Panchkarma. The aim of treatment is to give relief to the patient and treat in accordance with the Prakriti of the individual. A person suffering from chronic disease is not only given an Ayurvedic line of treatment but also the medications needed to boost the immune system. In today's jet age the common man often faces physical as well as mental stress. If these newly-emerging disorders are not treated at the right time, they progress into chronic diseases like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, cervical and lumber spondylosis, chronic sinusitis, asthma, bronchitis, sciatica, psoriasis, hyperacidity, migraine, cardiac and renal disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, piles, hepatitis, and cosmetic problems such as baldness, acne, wrinkles etc. Ayurveda does not give immediate relief from these problems but it goes down to the root cause thus ensuring there is no relapse of disease. The mainstay of Ayurveda, which makes this possible, is Panchkarma which purifies the body internally as well as externally. Diseases related to joints and the vertebral column such as paralysis and sciatica, which are known as vata vikara in Ayurveda, are treated by medicated oil massages (snehan) and with herbal treatments through steams, pindasweda or different types of basti, nasyakarma, as a result of which, the person feels healthy. In skin allergies and respiratory tract diseases such as asthma, the patient is treated by panchkarma therapies such as vaman (scientific emesis), virechan, and raktamokshan. All these types of treatment can give relief from chronic disease. Ayurvedic medicines (leach therapy) for abdominal diseases are quite effective. In lifestyle diseases such as hypertension and mental diseases such as depression, panchkarma procedures such as shirodhara and shirobasti are employed. The present day scenario of men and women pursuing high-profile careers and late marriages is resulting in increased incidence of impotence and infertility. Panchkarma treatments such as uttarbasti chikitsa and vajeekaran chikitsa are very helpful in these disorders.
