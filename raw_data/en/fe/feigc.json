We're extremely passionate about natural healing, and have created a fusion of chiropractic adjustments with energy and crystal therapy to maximize the flow of life- force energy throughout the body. This aids in deeper levels of healing for the mind, body and soul. Combining chiropractic adjustments with energy work, we can help you with an assortment of positive health benefits, including chronic pain relief, rebalancing of chakras/energy centers, healing trauma from your past, deepening your spiritual connection, and much more. Chiropractic adjustments release subluxations or blockages in the body's physical and energetic connectors, allowing the body to experience relief from pain or discomfort resulting from misalignments of the spine and other joints. This then allows us to experience more freedom of movement, as well as improved brain-body connection resulting from an interference free nervous system. Reiki energy helps to repair damage/clear blockages in the energy field, where all of life's experiences are recorded. Reiki replaces stagnant unhealthy energy with a spiritually guided energy that rebalances the chakras, creating a deeper connection to our inner selves.
