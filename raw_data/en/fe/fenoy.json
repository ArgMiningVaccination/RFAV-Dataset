In fact, manual spinal adjustments are the hallmark of traditional chiropractic care. Since the spinal cord houses the central nervous system, a maladjusted spine can generate pain, tingling and numbness throughout your body. Manual spinal adjustments can alleviate pressure on discs and nerves, in effect reliving pain. But chiropractic care can extend beyond spinal manipulation, incorporating a range of treatment protocols to help eliminate pain and restore optimal physical function. In addition to spinal manipulation, chiropractic rehab treatment may include: Heat and cold therapy: Cold therapy relieves pain and inflammation, and heat relaxes muscles and restores circulation to the injured area Massage: Massage of muscle tissues improves circulation, reduces inflammation and promotes quicker healing Exercise: Stretching and strengthening exercises help restore muscle balance and promote support of the spine Nutritional counseling: Chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders can interfere with joint and muscle health and slow healing. Nutrition is key to resolving metabolic function Ultrasonography: Ultrasound therapy can help reduce pain and relax muscle spasms, increasing circulation and speeding up the healing process Diathermy: This therapy bypasses passes soft tissues and heats denser tissues, to relax connective tissue and reduce muscle spasms Hydrotherapy: Using baths, whirlpools, saunas or wraps, hydrotherapy can be used to numb pain, relax muscles and promote healing ESWT (Extra-Corporeal Shock Wave Therapy): This technique uses light electrical pulses to reduce inflammation, relax muscle spasms and relieve pain TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation): With TENS, the patient controls the intensity of electrical stimulation, blocking the neural transmission of pain signals and releasing endorphins Traction: Traction devices stretch the spine, decompressing discs and reducing pressure on nerve root Ergonomic adjustments: Modifications of a work station may help moderate the negative effects of poor posture and work-related muscle imbalances Pelvic stabilization: Corrective arch supports and heel lifts may help optimize pelvic alignment and stability Patient Education: Chiropractors are educators at heart, and are keen on helping patients understand behaviors that contribute to back pain. Clearly, chiropractic care encompasses a much broader range of treatment options than just spinal manipulation.

Failure to accurately diagnose a condition in its early stages can lead to chronic problems and sometimes devastating results Diagnostic musculoskeletal sonography (MSUS) provides the perfect tool for the rehab practitioner. Yet many doctors and physical therapists have no experience with MSUS, are unaware of its advantages, and have no idea how to use it as a diagnostic tool. Below is a prime example of how ultrasound can take the guesswork out of diagnosis. where structural medical diagnosis is reflected in functional treatment, and vice versa. In this instance, an athlete was originally diagnosed with minor quadriceps muscle strain and was treated for four weeks, with unsatisfactory results. When he came to our clinic, the muscle was not healing, and the patients' muscle tissue had already begun to atrophy. Upon examination using MSUS, we discovered that he had a full muscle thickness tear that had been overlooked by his previous provider. To mitigate damage and promote healing, surgery should have been performed immediately after the injury occurred. Because of misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment, the patient now has permanent damage that cannot be corrected. The most important advantage of Ultrasound over MRI imaging is its ability to zero in on the symptomatic region and obtain imaging, with active participation and feedback from the patient. Using dynamic MSUS, we can see what happens when patients contract their muscles, something that cannot be done with MRI. From a diagnostic perspective, this interaction is invaluable.
