Naturopathic medicine blends centuries-old, natural, non-toxic therapies with advances in the science of health and human systems, covering all aspects of family health from prenatal to geriatric care. Naturopathic doctors (NDs) are the only primary care physicians trained in both natural and conventional approaches to prevent disease, treat acute illness, and manage or reverse chronic health conditions. It is effective in treating most health problems, both acute and chronic. Naturopathic medicine concentrates on whole-patient wellness, centers around the patient, and emphasizes prevention and self-care. Naturopathic physicians are guided by principles that are based on the premise that healing is intrinsic to the nature of all living organisms. Those principles include: - The Power of Nature - Support the body's innate ability to heal and remove obstacles to healing and recovery to support this inherent self-healing ability. - Identify and Treat the Cause - Seek to identify and remove the cause of illness rather than merely eliminate or suppress the symptoms. - First Do No Harm - NDs follow three precepts to avoid harming the patient. (1) Utilize methods and medicines which minimize the risk of harmful side effects; (2) Avoid, when possible, the harmful suppression of symptoms; and (3) acknowledge, respect, and work with the individual's self-healing process. - Doctor as Teacher - NDs spend significant time educating their patients and encourage self-responsibility for health and healthcare choices. - Treat the Whole Person - Popularized now as \"patient-centered healthcare,\" NDs have always treated patients by taking many factors that contribute to illness/wellness, including mental, physical, emotional, spiritual, and environmental (conventionally referred to as the \"social determinants of health.\") - Practice Prevention - NDs emphasize prevention of disease by addressing lifestyle, assessing risk factors, heredity, and susceptibility to disease, and by making appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness.
