Research, side effects Research articles on Trapusha: [Anti- cancer activity:](http://impactfactor.org/PDF/IJPCR/8/IJPCR,Vol8,Issue1,Article8.pdf) The present study explains a very superior anticancer action against liver cancer. The compound isolated from ethyl acetate fraction of Cucumis sativus flowers was tested for its anti- cancer activity against liver cancer HePG2 cell line by MTT assay. The CTC50 value of the sample was 103.7\u00b5g/ml against liver cancer HePG2 cell lines. Significant results were observed thereby proving the use of this plant in the traditional system of medicine. [Anti- diarrheal activity:](http://www.ijpda.com/admin/uploads/FT54Qg.pdf) The methanolic extract (ME) of the plant was studied for its anti-diarrheal properties in experimental diarrhea, induced by castor oil and gastrointestinal transit test in mice, at the oral doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight. In an anti- diarrheal study, ME showed significant (P< 0.001) dose-dependent inhibitory activity against castor oil induced diarrhea. A significant reduction (P< 0.001) in the gastrointestinal motility in charcoal meal test in mice was also observed, suggesting the extract might exert its anti-diarrheal activity by anti-secretory mechanism. [Laxative action of cucumber:](http://globalresearchonline.net/journalcontents/v12-2/024.pdf) The study was aimed to assess the possible laxative effect of aqueous fruit pulp extract of Cucumis sativus in Wistar albino rats.

Acute toxicity study revealed that the extract did not show any toxicity up to 4000 mg/kg so 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg, 1000 mg/kg dose was selected for pharmacological evaluation.
