However, just like extended families, they come together flawlessly if you unite them consciously and intentionally to reach your goals, conquer your dreams and achieve the peaceful calm you get from a weekend at the spa. How Your Zodiac Sign Influences Your Personality Horoscopes often prove eerily accurate (check out these [Chinese Zodiac Elements](/article/five-elements-find-your-chinese-element)). It's like you're staring into a mirror \u2014 you see your own personality, desires and truths reflected in the message. You can use that accuracy to choose essential oils that align with your needs and desires. If you're a Virgo, for instance, maybe you find yourself biting your fingernails and worrying about things outside your control, while Capricorns sometimes see the world in black and white instead of rich color. Your personality can influence more than your social habits and professional aspirations. For instance, Virgos might battle anxiety now and again because they can't turn off their worrying thoughts, while Capricorns could find themselves at risk for depression, headaches and other symptoms of a doom-and-gloom mindset. [Aromatherapy](/video/aromatherapy-nose-knows-barry-kapp) offers a chance to use your sense of smell to heal, focus and channel your energy effectively. While aromatherapy helps heal negative emotions and symptoms, it also brings out your positive personality traits and strengths. Massage and craniosacral therapy expert Suzanne Bovenizer points out that Libras thrive on [creativity and expression](http://www.suzannebovenizer.com/aromatherapy-essential-oils/libra), so they benefit from aromatherapy with essential oils like frankincense, rosemary and basil. How Strongly Do You Identify with Your Sign? While horoscopes offer a reliable roadmap to choosing essential oils, you're a complex, unique individual. When your birthday lies at the beginning or end of a particular sign's dates, you might take on some of the qualities of neighboring signs. If you were born on the cusp of Gemini, for instance, consider essential oils that benefit Taurus. Try out essential oils that you're attracted to, especially considering your personality traits. Following are a few suggestions to help you begin your journey toward enhanced clarity and growth. Aries: Rosemary Aries, you're always the life of the party, but you can't spend all your time entertaining others. Rosemary's soothing scent will relax your aching muscles and allow you to embrace temporary solitude. It's also ideal for stress relief because it reduces the levels of cortisol (the hormone responsible for your \"fight or flight\" instinct) in your body. Mixed into a massage oil, rosemary oil can help with those tender joints and cramped muscles. Taurus: Ylang-Ylang You're not opposed to the occasional romantic interlude, Taurus, so celebrate your sensual side with ylang-ylang essential oil \u2014 a mild but effective aphrodisiac.

Ylang-ylang will also lower your blood pressure when your temper gets the best of you. Whether you're using it as a prelude to romance or as a way to calm your nerves, add it to a hot bath filled with Epsom salt. Let the oil and the steam overwhelm your senses as the water relaxes your muscles. Gemini: Basil Gemini, you'll never shy away from intellectual discourse, whether you're debating Descartes or pondering politics. Basil, one of the most powerful essential oils, will bring out your quick wit and help you connect mentally with others. When you feel tense in unfamiliar surroundings or when emotional baggage gets too heavy, basil will get your blood pressure back under control. Basil works well in a diffuser when you use it to sharpen your mental focus. You can also add fresh crushed basil to a garden salad or a bowl of tomato soup if you're chasing this herb's health benefits. Cancer: Lavender Digestive distress can put a damper on your fun-loving personality, Cancer, especially if you're concealing a hint of resentment or fear. Lavender aids digestion and soothes an upset stomach to restore comfort. You sometimes slip into a moody malaise, Cancer, so use lavender to ease your anxiety, too.

Virgo: Chamomile Chamomile essential oil will ease your anxiety, Virgo, because of its mild sedative properties. Use it to slow your racing thoughts and calm your pounding heart.

Go deep, heal, surrender and let Frankincense transport you to faraway lands where time is never of the essence.

Patchouli essential oil works wonders for healing the emotional and psychological impact of stress. It can supply extra energy when you don't have anything left to give.

Sagittarius: Geranium As an astringent, geranium oil stimulates muscle contractions.

While your adversarial tendencies can come in handy, it's time to look for that elusive half-full glass. Lemon essential oil gives your mood a boost and helps you focus on the positives. Take a deep breath, relax and let lemon whisk you off to your happy place. Add the essential oil to your bath water or use lemon juice in a cup of tea or cold beverage so it can soothe your sinuses.

Next Article Ancient Medicine Berberine Could Help with Leaky Gut Syndrome Many call it \"leaky gut.\" Researchers and health practitioners call it \"increased intestinal permeability,\" \"dysbiosis,\" or \"hyperpermeable intestine,\" but no matter how you name it, leaky gut syndrome could be the jumping-off point for a huge range of \"first-world\" diseases. Leaky gut syndrome could be responsible for eczema and psoriasis, autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, acne, irritable bowel syndrome, and Crohn's disease to name a very few. Symptoms of leaky gut include diverse complaints including acne, cramps, gas, bloating, allergies, joint pain, brain fog, memory loss, or fatigue. Taken alone, any one of these symptoms may indicate a number of conditions, but when they show up in combination, and the root cause cannot be determined, it might pay off to explore leaky gut syndrome. Trying to treat symptoms when the underlying cause is leaky gut can be frustratingly unsuccessful. There's a way out, and research is showing that along with dietary changes and probiotics, recovery can be significantly potentiated with berberine, an ancient plant medicine. "}
