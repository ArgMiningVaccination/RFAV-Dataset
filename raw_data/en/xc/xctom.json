That's because it has a three-fold benefit for fertility, and it's also a natural, non-toxic and relatively affordable treatment. Acupuncture's proven success has led to growing acceptance by traditional Western medicine and patients alike. In practice, acupuncture is the application of thin needles inserted into the skin at defined locations to affect specific bodily functions. These points have been shown to have greater electrical conductance as well as a higher metabolic rate, temperature and concentrations of calcium ion. Acupuncture has been an element of Chinese medicine for thousands of years Benefits of acupuncture for fertility Acupuncture improves in vitro fertilization results, it aids in treating infertility and it reduces stress that has a negative effect on fertility. According to one study, women who received acupuncture treatment after IVF implantation were 65 percent more likely to conceive than those who did not. While not all studies have shown the same benefit on pregnancy rates, patients receiving acupuncture treatment often experience less stress, more control and greater satisfaction with their conventional fertility treatments. Such scientific qualification is one reason why acupuncture has gained acceptance, as proven results are the baseline of Western medicine. Here's how scientists who study acupuncture believe it aids infertility treatments: Acupuncture aids infertility - Acupuncture promotes stabilization of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, helping regulate the reproductive system Acupuncture helps regulate the blood levels of several fertility hormones - It stimulates blood flow to the pelvis. This may help ovarian responsiveness and thicken the endometrium, thereby making a more welcoming environment for an embryo - Electro-acupuncture (electronic stimulation) normalizes the secretion of reproductive hormones - It has been shown to have a positive effect on women with polycystic ovarian syndrome; increasing the opportunity for regular periods and ovulation. - It stimulates production of endorphins, affecting the gonadotropin-releasing hormone that helps regulate reproduction Acupuncture reduces stress & increases fertility In several studies, scientists have shown that acupuncture lowers stress hormones that may negatively impact fertility. More generally, anyone who has ever had an acupuncture session knows that it reduces overall stress level and brings on relaxation. It is not uncommon for a patient to fall asleep during an acupuncture treatment. \"Reducing the stress of being infertile or going through infertility treatment will be very beneficial,\" says Dr. Hinckley. \"I do not perform the acupuncture myself. We refer patients to local acupuncturists who are formally trained and licensed. Working with a properly trained acupuncturist is important. Look for a practitioner certified by the American Board of Oriental Reproductive Medicine (ABORM).\" At RSC, we work closely with your acupuncturist to ensure the treatments are the best available and customized for the needs of each patient. More studies are underway to determine the extent of acupuncture's benefit in treating infertility, as well as how it works to increase fertility. The lack of standardization in acupuncture techniques often makes it difficult to conduct studies. Dr. Hinckley believes that such research will continue to show that acupuncture holds tremendous promise in treating infertility. It is an effective, non-toxic and affordable treatment and an important aspect of integrative medicine.
