Natural balance is based on di vine balance Khaled Sawalha - PhD - Biotechnology & Biodiversity Associate Professor -Life Sciences. Faculty of Sciences & Technology Al-Quds University - West Bank - Jerusalem - Palestine Balance in nature and enviro nment was mentioned in the Qur'a n and should be maintained: Allah \"God\" says in the Qur'a n: \"And the earth We have spread out (Like a carpet); set thereon Mountains firm and immovable; And produced therein all kinds of things in due balance. And We have provided therein Means of subsistence - for you And for those for whose sustenance Ye are not responsible.\" (Ayat, sentences: 19 -20, Sura Hijr, which means \" the Rocky Tract \") Balance means that order, beauty and harmony are put by Lord Majesty \"Allah\". The land is described in poetical language that it is spread out like carpet for creatures to live and enjoy . This statement gives scientific in formation on environment. The di vine balance in nature ( the natural b alance ) offers conservation of biodiversity through time without facing dangers of extinction. Rational use by human kind is the way to keep and conserve for generations, this can be developed as sustainable use of natural resources. Each natural cycle is linked and balanced in harmony with other cycles and interacts with living organisms in complementary way. More information is mentioned in the Qur 'an decla ring ecological divine balance. An example of life in harmony between different organisms; relation between animals and plants: Honey bees take trees as their homes by spiritual revelation, Allah says: \"And thy Lord taught the Bee to build its cells in hills, on trees and in (men's) habituations. Then to eat of all, the produce (of the earth), and find with skill the spacious paths of its Lord: there issues from within their bodies a drink of varying colors, wherein is healing for men: Verily in this a sign for those who give thought ( Ayat, sentences 68-69, Surah Nahl ), which means the bee. In botany, it is well known that honey bees are active bio -agents in plant 2 pollination and they produce honey from plant extracts, this product is valuable as food and medicine. Natural biodiversity Allah describes diversity of plants in the Qur'a n and giving range of many differences among plants as sourc e of enjoyment and food. \"Seest though not that God. Sends down rain from the sky, and leads it through springs in earth, then He causes to grow, therewith, produce of various colors: then it withers thou wilt see it grow yellow; then He makes it dry up and crumble away. Truly, in this, is a message of remembrance to men of understanding.\" ( Surah Zumar, which means \"the Crowds \"). The description in the Arabic text of the Qura'n is really amazing and very enjoying in language (Balaghah means \" art of language \"). In other description the gardens are mentioned a s heavens and paradise of beauty: \"Gardens and springs And corn fields and date palms with spathes near breaking\", (Surah 147 -148 Shu'ara'a means \"the Poets \") with the weight of fruit. The words of Allah continue to state: \"Who make mischief in the land, A nd mend not (their ways) \" (Surah, 152 Shu'ara'a, \"the poets \"). Here there is clear link between water and plants. There are many ayat (sentences) of the Qura'n inviting people of all nations and races to think and respect creatures (i.e. plants) of Allah: \"See ye the seed that Ye sow in the ground? Is it ye that cause it to grow, or are We The cause. Where it our Will, We could crumble it to dry powder and ye would be left in wonderment.\" (Surah 63 -65 Waqi'a means \"t he Inevitable Event \"). The meaning is a s trong request from Allah to human kind to recognize the creation of all living organisms including plants by Allah and then to respect of this power and to admit the proof of God's plan and wisdom in nature. Allah provides creatures and natural resources as privileges and source of pleasure for human, among of these creatures are plants with huge diversity, Allah says: \"Then let man look at his food, for that we pour forth water in abundance, and we split the earth in fragments and produce therein corn, an d grapes and nutritious plants and olives and dates. And enclosed gardens dense with lofty trees and 3 fruits and fodder. For use and convenience to you and your cattle.\" 24 -32 Abas (Frowned). This diversity and its beauty is a clear sign of creation of God and man should conserve this natural life as Devine command. Human role The Devine command is directed to human to perform and enjoy thinking and recognition of Allah by referring to his creation of living organisms. The prophet Mohammad said: \"Nature is beautiful and green, and Allah puts human to look after earth and He (God) is watching the man what he is doing.\" Then man should respect this confidence of God to protect nature and keep natural balance. In Conclusion: Plants are source of food, medicines, source of shade to protect human and animals from sun heat and energy. Allah creates every organism to play its role in nature to ecological balance. Then sustainable use is a need and must be performed wisely. "}
