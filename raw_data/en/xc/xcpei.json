By bringing the whole person into balance, a naturopathic physician can restore overall wellness. A Naturopathic physician will focus on the interconnectedness of the mind, body, and spirit, but only naturopathic physicians go through a 4 year medical program, like an MD, to be trained the highest in their field. They use methods to help people harness their own healing abilities rather than treating each symptom without considering the whole. When a [naturopathic physician](https://www.cutlerintegrativemedicine.com/about/about-cim/) looks at a person, they do not see a set of symptoms but a whole individual whose systems have become out of balance. Holistic medicine often uses methods such as lifestyle changes, including diet, educating people on stress management and other mental health tools, and working with them to rein in excessive stress and anxiety. They may also recommend alternative treatments such as acupuncture and chiropractic care. Naturopathic physicians recognize that some medical conditions require that conventional and holistic medicine work together to achieve a patient's long-term wellness. In these cases, people may work with both their conventional medical doctor and naturopathic physician, like a naturopathic physician, to create an overall treatment plan. Alternately, more and more people use their naturopathic physician as their primary care physician. People choose [holistic medicine](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/what-is-holistic-medicine) for overall wellness because of its whole-body approach and its focus on achieving a balance between mind, body, and spirit. Many people feel drawn to this philosophy, especially when conventional medicine has not worked for them. Some people feel like conventional medicine treats a person as a set of symptoms requiring treatment. However, treating a physical symptom may not treat the physical root of the problem, nor heal the possible mental and emotional components that caused the symptoms, so the person never truly feels better. Some people also prefer a holistic approach to wellness because it does not rely on medications, which can have problematic side effects. On the other hand, lifestyle changes, patient education, and nutritional improvements rarely result in any side effects, and some people feel safer with this type of treatment. People benefit from holistic wellness because a naturopathic physician recognizes and addresses issues that affect the entire body and mind. For example, while many conventional medical practitioners see stress as a symptom and treat it with medication, naturopathic physicians, like doctors, may see it as a lifestyle issue that triggers a cascade of physical symptoms. Your naturopathic physician can work with your conventional medical team to make sure that none of the treatments conflict in any way. Some conventional practitioners even recommend patients to alternative therapies such as holistic wellness to help them learn about healthy lifestyle habits and improvements.
