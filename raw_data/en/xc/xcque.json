Keep in mind that it may use different item/location names than the English translation. Chapter 1[ ] - Go to the Diner. [Sill](/wiki/Sill)will leave the party here. - After leaving the Diner, visit the other locations in the town, then return to the Diner. Sill should have a new sprite. - Visit item shop. 'Talk' to Reagan several times to improve Yocchan's affection, this only works once. Increasing her affection will improve the prices. Assaulting her gives a CG, but this will lower her affection. (You should do this later before buying the item shop.) Choose 'Brute' option to steal a Seirogan. The number of times you can do this before Rance stops is random. - Glitch: If at the start of the game you: H Yocchan at least 5 times, leave the shop, return, and then pick the first option in the dialogue, then any time when you ask her for your affection score should result in you being placed in a menu where you can buy her items at half price. Future changes to your affection score do not seem to negate this glitch until you've done both of her side-quests, which can cause her to go back to 8x prices. - The Aphrodisiac she sells can be used to get a CG at night when you call Sill. - Visit church to meet Cynthia. Talk to her and she will ask Rance to find her sister Alicia. - All the items that Cynthia sells are useless and just a scam. - Visit mysterious building, which is Cassado's Youth League Office. Learn a bit about the town's origins. - After visiting everywhere, you may now leave the town. Look at the surroundings to gain the ability to travel to each tower. - The only towers you will be able to enter from the meadow will be the West Tower and the Big Tower later in the game. - Enter the West Tower. - Go to the north room with a staircase leading up. Then move to the left and keep following the hallway till you get to the last room. You'll fight a Happy [Kyan Kyan](/wiki/Kyan_Kyan)there. Defeating it will give you 1990 exp, allowing [Rance](/wiki/Rance)to gain 8 levels immediately. (You'll have to call [Level Goddess](/wiki/Level_God) [Willis](/wiki/Willis)for each separate level though.) Don't worry about missing gal monster CG's; assaulting Happy Kyan Kyan gives the same CG as assaulting any Kyan Kyan. - Leave the tower when you hit at least level 5 and gain [Rance Attack](/wiki/Rance_Attack). - Due to the way Special Auto mode works, you should set Rance to use Rance Attack in all 4 slots. There is no cool down for using Rance Attack this way, but it is a random chance to use it. This also applies to Rick's By La Way. - Go to the Diner and choose 'Sill' to get a new CG and fight the hag. With Rance Attack, she should be easy. - After beating Freoncoise, Sill will rejoin the party. Rest at the Diner to get a new CG and gain the Letter of Introduction. - You can go to West Tower Floor 2 and talk with Haniwa statue and ask Sill to touch it you will get 500 golds for that (just once). - Visit the Youth League Office and give them the letter. From now on, you can use the 'Brute' command in Youth League Office once a day to get 200 golds. This is your only reliable source of golds (Treasure Lumps drop puny amount of gold), so it's worth visiting the office everyday. - Visit the Church and move to the Secret Room. - Get the Bronze bell and Empty Tin Can from the southwest room. Head to the NE rooms. There will be a forced battle at the end of corridor. (Treasure Lump drops Lightning Sword.) - After the forced battle, place the bell and the can in the adjacent rooms to unlock the east door. - Move right past the newly unlocked door into a room with an imprisoned girl (Purple). Talk to her, then leave. - Continue right into the boss room. Focus on the Okayu Fever, just ignore the magician girl. When you killed Okayu the magician girl will escape. (Even if you grind really hard or cheat and kill/assault Magician, the same events will happen.) - Rance will acquire a key which can be used to free Purple. You will see her again (CG) later when you rest at Diner. (After this encounter, you can talk with Cynthia at the church to ask how to cure Purple's lewdness. You can get the cure in any random encounter later that includes an Okayu Fever and a Treasure Lump.) - Take the Bronze Bell and Empty Can from the pedestals when you leave (you will use them later again). Return to town to H Mai. Chapter 2[ ] - Go to the Item Shop and talk to Yocchan to receive an errand. She will give you 'Pintel 486' that you will take to a man known as Happy Fukuda. Also, buy rubber gloves under necessities; never know when those will come in handy (pun unintended). - Go back to the church and into the Secret Room (South Tower B1F). - Go to the bottom right room and open the door using Okayu Key.
