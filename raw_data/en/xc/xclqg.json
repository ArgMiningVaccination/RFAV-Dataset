This is more likely in elderly people or people with diabetes, as the condition can cause nerve damage which affects how you feel pain. Discomfort in the chest can be caused by many things from a heart attack to indigestion and muscle strain. Learn more about the [different causes of chest pain](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chest-pain/). It's essential to dial 999 if you have any symptoms that could be a heart attack. If you think you need to be seen before you can speak to your GP but you don't think you're having a heart attack, call 111 for an assessment. Don't delay because you think hospitals are too busy - the NHS still has systems in place to treat people for heart attacks. If you delay, you are more likely to suffer serious heart damage and more likely to need intensive care and to spend longer in hospital. It's important you get medical attention immediately. Don't worry about wasting paramedics' time - a heart attack is a medical emergency. You should: Most heart attacks are caused by [coronary heart disease (CHD)](/informationsupport/conditions/coronary-heart-disease). CHD causes your coronary arteries to become narrowed by a gradual build-up of fatty deposits called atheroma. If a piece of atheroma breaks off, a blood clot forms around this to try and repair the damage to the artery wall. This clot can block your coronary artery, causing your heart muscle to be starved of blood and oxygen. Other less common causes of a heart attack include: Although symptoms can vary from person to person, women and men generally experience the same heart attack symptoms. However, research shows women tend to not recognise the symptoms as a sign of a heart attack as quickly. This is mainly because heart attacks are wrongly believed to be a \"man's problem.\" In the UK, an average of four women die of coronary heart disease every hour, many of them due to a heart attack.

Don't try and take yourself to hospital, as the ambulance team will give you the best care and do tests on the way. In the ambulance, the team will do an [electrocardiogram ](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/tests/ecg)(ECG) to measure the electrical activity of your heart. This is an important test to find out if you're having a heart attack. If the ECG shows you're having a heart attack, you'll be taken to a specialist centre to get the best treatment. Whether or not the ECG confirms a heart attack, you'll need further tests to find out what's going on. These [tests ](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/diagnosis/)may include: You might hear a heart attack being called acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary thrombosis while you're at hospital.

You'll usually stay in hospital for about two to five days after having a heart attack. This depends on what treatment you've had and how well you're recovering. During your stay, you'll be monitored and have tests to see how well your heart is recovering.

During your stay, you might be moved to a cardiac ward. You won't be discharged (sent home) from hospital until your doctor is certain you're well enough to go home. To decide this, they'll talk to you about going home and do assessments such as have you climb stairs to see if you're fit enough. This September, BHF is shining a spotlight on hidden heart conditions. But we need your help. When you get home, it's a good idea to gradually build up how much you do. Even if you don't feel like it, many people find getting up, washing and dressing a positive first step. Over time, you can do some light household activities like making a hot drink or get back into the habit of doing the usual things like the washing up. Walking around the house or standing up from the chair and marching on the spot for a minute is another way of keeping active. You might find it helpful to have someone stay with you for the first few days or weeks once you return home. If it's not safe for you to be discharged from the hospital on your own, you may be able to stay longer. You can speak to your team about going home as soon as possible and they can help you get support like a small, temporary package of care or special equipment at home if you need it.
