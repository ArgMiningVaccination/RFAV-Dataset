Shri. Bhagat Singh Koshyari Chancellor, MUHS, Nashik & Governor of Maharashtra State FOREWORD It gives me immense pleasure and great satisfaction to present the sixth Perspective Plan of the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) for the period of 2022 -2027. After taking over the charge as acting Vice Chancellor of this Unive rsity, I have Successfully accomplished The task of presenting this Perspective Plan, with the active Support of Planning Board Department, as well as valuable suggestions received from various dignitaries, such as MPs, MLAs, MLCs and members of various authorities of the University and Minister of Medical Education & Pro -Chancellor of this University Hon'ble Shri. Amitji Deshmukh. Let me also acknowledge the valuable guidance of Hon'ble Secretary, Medical Education &. Drugs Department, Dr. Saurabh Vijay, I.A.S. and Hon'ble Director, Directorate, Medical Education & Research, Dr. Deelip G. Mhaisekar without which I would find it extremely difficult to present this plan. The perspective plan is prepared after an extensive interaction with the members of the respective Regional Development Boards, representatives of various NGOs, Deans of the Faculties, Dean/Principals of the affiliated Colleges of Health Sciences, prominent social workers, distinguished Academicians, Authorities of the Universi ty, Members of the parliament and members of the Legislative Assembly & Council, Ex. Vice -Chancellor Dr. Deelip G. Mhaisekar, Ex. Pro Vice -Chancellor Dr. Mohan Khamgaonkar and authorities of Department of Medical Education & Drug Department and Department of Public Health, Govt. of Maharashtra, Directorate of Medical Education & Research, Directorate General of Health Sciences & Directorate of Medical Education & Research, Directorate General of Health Sciences & Director of AYUSH. This University was esta blished in the year 1998. The very concept of establishing MUHS was to observe / Promote a uniform administrative policy and impart equal quality medical education of all pathies at par with international standards using modern methods and gadgets. We have had in our mind that we must consider Social, Cultural, Economic and Geographical aspects of the State, while positioning an Institute of medical education. We need to have a health education which addresses health problems apparent in different soc io- economic classes. After first and second perspective plan, various changes took place in the education System due to Hon'ble Supreme Court in guidelines, and guidelines, which have been duly considered in the latest and revised plan. Recently, Niti Aayo g gave more emphasis on availability of hospital beds and health care services for non -urban and remote areas. The new National Education policy is inclined towards more autonomy to Health Sciences institutions, transparency, higher standards & self govern ance. The pandemic situation and Task Force Committee members have also recommended that the focus needs to be on regulation of imparting skills to the paramedical healthcare workers, which compels us to re - think on the modalities for skill enhancement of paramedical personnel in the State of Maharashtra. The University will strive to achieve global status, by taking a place among Top 100 University in the world and recognition as number one at the National level among all Health Sciences Universities in I ndia. Our aim will be to provide high quality research oriented education and holistic health care as well as to encourage the academic learning environment. Medical Education in all sectors should be improved so as to improve the quality of life of the common man. The Plan proposes to promote research and to include ethical guidelines for conducting medical research in all the systems of medicine. To promote research in collaboration with technical Institutes, industries and attempts will be made to prom ote innovation and patent acquisition. India has a rich heritage in Health care Sciences from the times of Sushrut and Charaka. In the University, we can build a Research Center having fully developed research laboratory with modern technology available fo r all research to promote Inter -disciplinary and Inter - faculty research. Many sections of our society in the interior part of the State of Maharashtra are virtually ignorant about various illnesses, vaccinations, hygiene practices and other pediatric and geriatric Health hazards. The concept of primary health care is not efficient due to the lack of infrastructure and unavailability of trained manpower. The ratio of number of doctors and nurses in rural areas is lopsided with very few trained doctors and paramedical personnel available in rural areas. I am sure that this Perspective Plan will give a wider horizon and greater perspective to the aspirations of students, teachers and managements and the day is not far away when MUHS will shape its position not only on the map of India but that of the world for its academic excellence. It is our desire to have maximum transparency in all the fields of health sciences education. In view of the Government Policy, University has planned to have various Certifica te / Fellowship Courses under skillful Department of Government of India I am confident that this Perspective Plan will cater for the needs of medical education and medical services of society as it clearly defines the policy of equitable distribution of medical colleges of all pathies along with its hospitals within the jurisd iction of the University. On behalf of the Perspective Plan committee, I thank all the official members, representatives of the various authorities of the University, MPs, MLCs for providing their valuable suggestions, guidance & co -operation for s haping this Perspective Plan. I am also thankful to MUHS staff for their wholehearted efforts in preparing the Perspective Plan. Finally, we at this University firmly believe that, there is always ample scope for improvement in any given situation. We are committed for improvement & we will always stirve for it (Prof Dr. Nitin Karmalkar) Vice - chancellor(Acting) MUHS, Nashik CONTENTS Sr. No. Particulars Page No. I Introduction and Background 01 II Objective, Applicability and Aspiration of the Perspective Plan 03 III Rationale A) Trends in Population Growth 07 B) Role of Medical Education in Improving Health of People 12 C) Analysis of Quantitative and Qualitative Distribution of the Health Sciences Education Facilities 14 IV Criteria for recommending the Opening of a New College 15 V Proposals and Recommendations 17 A) Starting of New Colleges of Health Science Education 19 B) Increase In Intake Capacity 20 C) Upgradation of Existing Institutions D) Post Graduate and Super Specialty Education in Health Sciences 21 List of Annexures: Annexure Particulars Page No. 1 Ranking of Districts by Population Size 23 2 Region wise Percentage Population 25 3 Municipal Corporation Population 26 4 Region wise Population Density per sq. km. 27 List of Tables : Sr. No. Particulars Page No. 1 List of Affiliated Colleges as on 15/07/2021 to MUHS (Table No. 1 to 11) 28 2 List of Colleges Affiliated to Deemed University as on 15/07/2021 (Table No. 12) 47 MAHARASHTRA UNIVERSITY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, NASHIK PERSPECTIVE PLAN 2022 -27 Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 1 I) INTRODUCTION AND BACK GROUND The Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) is guided by a strategic agenda providing right direction to the Health Science education in the State. It consistently strives hard to improve quality in Health Science Education to take Health education & its services to greater heights. The Maharashtra University of Health Sciences was established on 10th June 1998 by MUHS Act No.X of 1998 with purpose of ensuring proper and systematic instruction, teaching, training a nd research. As per the provision under Section 64 (1) of MUHS Act, it is the duty of the University to prepare a Perspective Plan for educational development for the location of institutions of higher learning in a manner ensuring equitable distribution o f facilities of Health Sciences education having due regard in particular to the needs of un-served and underdeveloped areas in the State. Such a Plan is to be prepared by the Academic Council and to be placed before the Senate through the Manage ment Council as per the MUHS Act. The MUHS is a teaching and affiliating University and has its following objectives: - (a) To carry out its responsibility of creation, preservation and dissemination of knowledge . (b) To promote discipline and the spirit of intell ectual inquiry and to dedicate itself as a fearless academic community to the sustained pursuit of excellence . (c) To encourage individuality and diversity within a climate of tolerance and mutual understanding . (d) To promote freedom, secularism, equality and soc ial justice as enshrined in the Constitution of India and to be the catalyst in socioeconomic transformation by promoting basic attitudes and values of essence to the national development . (e) To extend the benefits of knowledge and skills for development of i ndividuals and society by associating the University closely with local and regional problems. (f) To carry out social responsibility as an informed and objective critic, to identify and cultivate talent, to train the right kind of leadership in all walks of l ife and to help younger generation to develop right attitude, interest and values . (g) To promote equitable distribution of facilities of Health Sciences education . (h) To provide for efficient and responsive administration, scientific management and develop organization of teaching and research. Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 2 (i) To promote acquisition of knowledge in rapidly developing and changing society and to continually offer opportunities of upgrading knowledge, training and skills in the context of innovations, research and discovery i n all fields of human endeavor by developing educational network related to Health Sciences with use of modern communication media and technologies appropriate for a learning society . (j) To strive to promote competitive merit and excellence as the sole guiding criterion in all academic and other matters relating to students . (k) To impart education and training to achieve the goal of physical, mental and spiritual Health of every individual . (l) To create better understanding between different systems of medicin es through interdisciplinary study and research. (m) To establish and develop Indian Systems of Medicine so as to maintain the Health of a Healthy individual and to cure the disease of diseased individual. This plan is prepared by the MUHS by keeping in view w ith reference to the changing scenario of Medical Education as under - In olden times, education was considered as an act of charity or philanthropy. Gradually, it became an occupation. Some judicial dicta hold it as an \"industry\". As of now, imparting edu cation and in particular medical education has become a means of livelihood for some professionals and mission for life for the altruists. This change in outlook gave rise to setting up of Private Medical Colleges. It also resulted in as the medical educat ion getting global recognition. After first and second Perspective Plan, various changes took place in the education system due to Hon'ble Supreme Court judgements and guidelines, which have been duly considered in the latest and revised plan. Recently, N ITI Aayog gave more emphasis on availability of hospital beds and health care services for non -urban and remote areas. The new National Education Policy is inclined towards more autonomy to Health Sciences institutions, transparency, higher standards & sel f governance. The Pandemic situation and Task Force Committee members have also recommended that the focus needs to be on regulation on imparting skills to the Paramedical healthcare workers, which compels us to re-think on the modalities for skill enhan cement of paramedical personnel in the State of Maharashtra. * * * * * Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 3 II) OBJECTIVES, APPLICABILITY AND ASPIRATION OF THE PERSPECTIVE PLAN A) OBJECTIVES : The objective of the University, in preparing a Perspective Plan for Health Science Education in the State, is in consonance with the objectives of the University as laid down under section 4 (g) and section 64 of the MUHS Act 1998. The University will st rive to achieve global status, by taking a place among Top 100 Universities in the world and recognition as number one at the National level among all Health Sciences Universities in India. Our aim will be to provide high quality research oriented educatio n and holistic health care as well as to encourage the academic learning environment. Medical Education in all sectors should be improved so that trained doctors of this University can provide better patient care to society , so as to improve the quality of life of the common man. The Perspective Plan is prepared after an extensive interaction with the members of the respective Regional Development Boards, representatives of various NGOs, Deans of the Faculties, Dean/Principals of the affiliated Colleges o f Health Sciences, prominent social workers, distinguished Academicians, Authorities of the University, Ex-Vice Chancellor, Ex-Pro-Vice Chancellor, Members of the Parliament and members of the Legislative Assembly & Council, and authoritie s of Department of Medical Education & Drug Department and Department of Public Health, Govt. of Maharashtra, Directorate of Medical Education & Research, Directorate General of Health Sciences & Director of AYUSH. B) APPLICABILITY: 1. The provisions under this Sixth Plan for Opening of New Health Sciences Colleges under State of Maharashtra will not be applicable to Centeral Government / State Government/ Minority Institutions and Deemed Universities to open any Health Sciences College anywhere in the State of Maharashtra. 2. This plan will remain in force for opening of any New College of Health Sciences / Increase Intake capacities from Academic Year 2022 -2023 to 2026 -2027. 3. The provisions under this plan will not be applicable to Institutions to start Ph.D/M .Phil courses/ Post Graduate and Super Specialty courses / B.N.Y.S./ B.S.M.S./ Fellowship Courses / Certificate Courses / PG DMLT/ B.Sc.PMT & other Paramedical Courses. 4. All provisions under this plan will be effective prospectively from 1st September 2021 onwards. Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 4 C) ASPIRATIONS: 1) Establishing Health Sciences Colleges in each District of Maharashtra: One major challenge faced by the State / Country is about the shortage of trained human resource in Health care. New Medical Colleges shall be opened in each District place including tribal and undeveloped area in different regions. Therefore, this plan proposes as follows: - Establishment of New Institutions of Health Sciences on the basis of the need of District of the region. Establishment of New Institutions giving priority to undeveloped/tribal/remote areas of respective District of the region. Preference to un -served and underserved population while establish ing Institutions. Establishment of Institutions run by the Municipa l Corporation and semi -government organizations in respective areas so that the poor and the needy people can have regular access to the facility of treatment for common diseases , so as to achieve equity in Health Science education facility and quality of Health care in the State. Concession in fees for opening of Colleges in tribal / hilly areas as notified by the Government of Maharashtra from time to time. Opening of Under Graduate & Post Graduate Colleges of Medical, Dental, Ayurved, Unani, BNYS, BSMS, Homoeopathy, Allied Health Sciences & Other faculties by the University. To encourage the Private Firms / Corporate Sector(s) / Private Hospital(s) to open Health Education College on Public Private Partnership (PPP) Mode or on profit making criteria in th e vicinity of that orgnization. 2) Public Private Partnership in Super Specialty: Superspecialty, Super Subspecialty, Fellowship & Certificate courses can be started in well-equipped private hospitals on the basis of Public Private Partnership. Post Grad uate seats are available mostly in cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Aurangabad, that too in a very small number. However, expertise and faculties are also available in private sector. Because of monetary constraint, it is difficult for public sector to maintain such expert manpower. Hence, under the scheme of Public Private Partnership, Superspecialty hospitals in private sector can be attached to a Superspecialty department of Medical College, so that expertise and faculty would be shared and private s ector faculty can contribute in Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 5 Superspecialty education. Such model shall be evolved so that the number of Superspecialty seats can be increased and clinical material available in Private Superspecialty hospitals can be utilized to its optimum. 3) Need B ased Education (New Innovative Courses) : Efforts shall be made to create new innovative courses & research like - a) MD in Infectious diseases. b) MD in Emergency Medicine. c) MD in Sports Medicine. d) MD in Epidemiology e) Virology. f) Bacherlor of Naturopathy, Siddha & Yogic Sciences. g) MD in YOGA. 4) Need Based Research: The Plan proposes to promote research and to include ethical guidelines for conducting medical research in all the systems of medicine. To promote research in collaboration with technical Institutes, industries and attempt s will be made to promote innovation and patent acquisition. India has a rich heritage in Health care Sciences from the times of Sushrut and Charaka. In the University, we can build a Research Center having fully developed research laboratory with modern technology available for all research to promote Inter -disciplinary and Inter -faculty research. As per the need of Industry & Society, Industry sponsored research needs to be promoted. Separate Clinical Trial Department of the Univer sity needs to be established. Workshops for the students and teachers on research methodology needs to be conducted on regular basis. 5) Multi Centric Clinical Trial Department: To encourage research activities, clinical material available in the affiliated Health Sciences instititutes can be utilized in conducting multi centric clinical trials for research & innovations by involving Institutes in given legal frame work. Such proj ects will need approval of Government of India as per its rules & regulation. The pharmaceutical Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 6 companies, exclusively for academic purpose, can take such type of opportunities and can provide sponsorship to such clinical trials / research / innovations. 6) Quality of Medical Education: The plan proposes to take a review and to analyze the institutions on following criteria and accreditation of institutions considering the following : - a) Upgrade Curricullum as per recent trends. b) Teaching -learning and eva luation. c) Research consultancy and extension. d) Infrastructure and learning resources. e) Student support and progression. f) Organization and management. g) Healthy practices. There is evidence to suggest that on the basis of above criterion, accredited institutions are delivering superior quality education compared to others. Therefore, one of the objective of the University is to encourage the institutions to get NAAC Accredit ed. The College / Institutions, affiliated to the University with 10 years standing, should get accredited by NAAC so that, they can set an example for New Established College to get NAAC accredited. At the same time, it can be expected the attached hospit al of the College should also get accredited by NABH. * * * * * Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 7 III) RATIONALE: A) Trends in Population Growth: Issues of Health problems on the society varies from region to region in the State. The tribal districts are loaded with genetic disorders, inherited diseases, malnutrition, infestation and infectious diseases. Developed districts shows different problems like industrial hazards, pollution, psychiatric ailments, reproductive tract infections, HIV/AIDS and host of degenerative disorders. In addition, urban areas suffer due to problems of slums, overcrowding, want of civic amenities, growing crimes etc. Child abuse and atrocities against women are growing in all areas. Many parts of the State still do not have adequate facilities for maternal and child health. There is mal -distribution of health service facilities including doctors, nurses and para -clinical pe rsonnel in the State. Following table shows Doctor Population ratio for the Year 2021. Year Approximate State Population Number of Doctors Total (1 to 5) Medical Dental Ayurved Unani Homoeopathy 1 1:375 Note - The ratio is calculated by taking data from respective Maharashtra Councils. Development Boards : By an Act of Parliament, three Development Boards, namely (1) Rest of Maharashtra, (2) Marathwada and (3) Vidarbha ( Please see Annexure -2) Board, came into existence with an objective of correctin g regional imbalance in respect of Economic growth, Industrial growth and Educational growth of neglected regions. As per information in the State Statistical Abstract of Maharashtra published by Directorate of Economics & Statistics, Government of Maharas htra Mumbai; though the average growth rate is 9.58% for the decade 2011 -21, it is not uniform across all the districts. Population of few districts have grown faster compared to others. Density of Population per sq.km. gives more realistic picture of popu lation distribution in the State. From Annexure - 4, it indicates that the population density of each district has also found to be rised. Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 8 In addition to the population, health needs of a society are also determined by population of poor and weaker section e.g. scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, population of vulnerable section of society, population of children below 6 years, population of pr egnant women and population of old. Per capita income also needs consideration. Doctor -Population ratio : Doctor: Population ratio is nebulous indicator for deciding the need of medical practitioners required for a particular region. Doctor: Population ratio in India is 1 : 1456 (i.e. 1 doctor for 1456 population) whereas for the State of Maharashtra is 1 : 1134. However, if data of all Health Sciecnes professions (all MBBS, BDS, BAMS , BUMS & BHMS registered G raduates doctors) is taken i nto consideration, this ratio changes. After getting revised and recent figures of available doctor's under the State of Maharashtra from the concerned Council / Commission, the revised Docter Population ratio (including all pathy doctors) stands to 1 : 535. The above statistics is provided by CEHAT (Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes). However, to calculate number of Colleges to be permitted in the region or district, on the basis of Doctor Population ratio during the year 2022 -2027, may not be ideal because Doctor Population ratio Stated in various books, journals, news papers or World Health Organization is rough and crude. The present Doctor Population ratio is based on over -all population. There are differences in urban and rural populati on. The ratio is still different for tribal population. The availability of doctors in the population after completing education depends on various factors. There is huge difference between number of registered doctors at council and actual practicing doc tors in population. It is observed that, out of the doctors registered to the Central Councils or Maharashtra Councils, some doctors have gone abroad for higher education or for better prospects, some doctors have accepted other professions & some doctors have stopped medical practice due to age / illness / domestic reasons. Remaining doctors enter into private practice or service in rural or urban areas. All these factors are not within the purview of the University for monitoring. Besides this, there are many factors that needs to be considered like; Geographic location of the Institute, facilities available for proper living, connectivity by road and railways, social factors, educational status of the population, availability of teachers etc, Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 9 while consi dering a proposal to start a Health Science College. Therefore, the factor of using Doctor:Population ratio as an indicator for establishment of New Health Science Colleges has limitations. Role of The University And Need For Health Sci ence Professional : Many sections of our society in the interior part of the State of Maharashtra are virtually ignorant about various illnesses, vaccinations, hygiene practices and other pediatric and geriatric Health hazards. The concept of primary healt h care is not efficient due to the lack of infrastructure and unavailability of trained manpower. The ratio of number of doctors and nurses in rural areas is lopsided with very few trained doctors and paramedical personnel available in rural areas. It is distressing to note that in India, 76% of physicians render their services to urban population, which comprises only 24% of total population, while 76% of rural population is looked after by a mere 24% of the total number of physicians. In Maharashtra, 42% of population is urban and is looked after by a huge doctor force. As India is a developing country, the norms prescribed by W.H.O. regarding Doctor : Population ratio are more practicable and therefore it is acceptable for us. The W.H.O. recommends Doct or:Population ratio as 1:1000. Doctor Population Ratio prescribed by WHO restricts for Medical doctors only and does not include other pathy/faculty doctors. Therefore, the University has asked the required ratio for India from the concerned Council. As t here is no reply from the Council the University intends to do further research in this area. Special Task Committee will be appointed by the Hon'ble Vice -Chancellor to find out requirements of Doctor, Specialist and Superspecialist, Nurses and Paremedical & Technical staff per 1000 population, so that this document can be useful for the entire country as a reference. The present Doctor : Population ratio for India of Allopathy doctor is 1 doctor per 1456 population & for the State of Maharashtra is 1 per 1134 population. It must also be kept in mind that the Doctor:Population ratio drawn for the State again largely differs within the State itself, if it is drawn separately for urban and rural areas. Following table shows the deficit of number of doctors r equired in the State of Maharashtra. Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 10 Sr. No Year State Population Total No. of doctors Doctors Population ratio Total No. of doctors required compaired to International Norms of 1: 250 GAP of doctors to population 1 2021 124904071 Test Data for rising demand for Health Science Education: The need can also be exemplified from the number of aspirant students appearing for NEET conducted by the Central body. As per data of aspirant candidates for seeking admission in Heath Sciences courses from the State of Maharashtra, 195338 candidates have appeared in NEET examination 2020 for Academic Year 2020 -21. Out of these, 79974 candidates have qualified NEET to be eligible for admission. However, total number of seats available for admissions in Academic Year 2020 -21 were 33769 only (approx). It mea ns that Ratio of availability of seats compared to aspirant medical candidates stands to 1:2. It shows that there is growing demand for Health Sciences admissions in the society. Health Manpower : The term Health manpower of the country includes both pro fessional and auxiliary Health personnel, who are needed to provide the health care to the society. Various norms have been devised but an ideal is yet to be reached. If more number of doctors are produced, out of them at least few doctors may go to rural and tribal areas, which will help to reduce cost on health services. If adequate health manpower is produced, it will help for proper utilizations of trained manpower as well as saturation of health manpower at one region will enforce health professional s to migrate to such areas where demand is more. It is a well established fact that, if educational facilities are set up in district hospitals the standard of clinical services rendered increases. National Health Policy 2002 has mentioned about uneven spread of Medical or Dental Colleges across various parts of the country. Apart from uneven geographical distribution of medical institutions, quality of education is highly uneven and in several instances not up to the mark. Therefore, all Health Sciences Colleges must carry out their education, research and service activities towards addressing the priority health concerns of the community, region and nation, which they have a mandate to serve. The priority health concerns are to be identified jointly by Government, Health Care organizations, Health Professionals and the Public. Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 11 Undergraduate Education In Health Sciences : Certain districts do not have any Medical, Dental, Ayurved, Homoeopathy, Unani, Nursing, Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy Colleges in particular area. If any body / an Institute / trust / corporation desires to start a College in the districts where no College of any pathy is in existence, preference will be given in Opening of N ew College. Colleges that will start in prime zones definitely have a market advantage and therefore higher fee shall be levied. Thickly populated regions also need Health Sci ence Institutes as their health needs consideration. * * * * * Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 12 B) Role Of Medical Education In Improving Health of People : At this juncture it may be pertinent to note some facts about community health. As per World Health Organization (1948) \"Health is a State of complete physical, mental and social well being and not merely an absence of disease or infirmity\". WHO definition envisages three specific dimensions - the physical, the mental and the social. Many more may be cited, viz. spir itual, emotional, vocational, philosophical, cultural and so on. Health in the broad sense does not merely mean absence of disease or provision of diagnostic, curative and preventive services. It includes a State of physical, mental and social well -being. The harmonious balance of this State of the human individual integrated into his environment constitutes health. The WHO definition of health introduces the concept of \"well -being\". The subject component of well -being is referred as \"quality of life\". Cert ain important indicators are now frequently used to measure quality of life. The \"Physical quality of Life index\" is one. It consolidates three indicators viz. infant mortality, life expectancy at age one and literacy. The second is Human Development Index . Human Development Index is a composite index combining indicators representing three dimensions' longevity, knowledge and income. In 1978, at the Alma Ata -International conference, WHO declared \"Health for All\" through primary Health care as the major so cial goal. The Alma Ata conference called on all governments to formulate national policies, strategies and Plan of action to launch and sustain Primary Health Care as National Health System. Our National Health Policy, echoes the WHO call for \"Health for All\" and the Alma Ata declaration. It has laid down specific goals to bring down infant mortality, to raise life expectancy, to reduce crude death rate, to reduce birth rate and to reduce net reproduction rate. Primary Health Care includes : - a) Education about prevailing health problems. b) Promotion of food supply and proper nutrition. c) Adequate supply of safe water and basic sanitation. d) Maternal and child health care including family Planning. e) Immunization against infectious diseases. f) Prevention and control of endemic diseases. g) Appropriate treatment of common diseases and injuries. h) Provision of essential drugs.

Criteria to ensure equitable distribution of Health Sciences Colleges: - Sr. No. Faculty Population of Maharashtra Colleges per district (to ensure equitable distribution, irrespective of population) 1 Medical 124904071 5 2 Dental 124904071 5 3 Ayurveda 124904071 6 4 Unani 124904071 3 5 Homoeopathy 124904071 5 BASLP 124904071 3 10 BPO 124904071 3 3. Other points for consideration a. For determination of Population for any non -census year, population certified by District Collector or State Government from time to time, shall be the valid population. Alternatively, MUHS shall determine the population of each district, by considering the growth rates by usi ng arithmetic progression method. b. If there is no vacancy for a College in an area, as per the both of above criteria, then proposals for starting of New Colleges shall not be recommended to the Government. c. The National Education Policy is a comprehensive framework to guide the development of Health Care education in India. The main thrust of this policy regarding higher education is to end the fragmentation of higher education by transforming higher educatio n institutions into large multidisciplinary Universities, Colleges, Health Education Institutes Clusters / Knowledge Hubs. This policy will help to develop active research communities across discipliners including integrated research. It will provide an op portunity to exercise pluralistic choices in health care, wherein any student admitted in allopathy medical education will have a basic understanding of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) and vice versa. It also focuses tha t Higher Education Institutes to become multidisciplinary institution for optimum use of infrastructure & resources in order to have vibrant multidisciplinary communities. National Education Policy also emphasis to establish Higher Education Institutions comprising three types of institutions till 2030 such as Research Intensive University, Teaching Intensive University & Autonomous Degree granting College. Above policy will also be governed by the University during implementation of Perspective Plan 2022-27. Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 17 V) PROPOSALS & RECOMMENDATIONS : Looking at the current population of the State and its requirement for trained doctors and other healthcare professionala, it may be concluded that the existing Health Sciences Education institutions are not eno ugh to cater to increasing demands and aspirations as well as the need to cater for accretion of trained manpower. However, what is required is an equitable distribution of existing intake capacity between all districts and also a projection for the future . Therefore, there is a need to have at least one Health Science(s) College(s) of each pathy in every district , when one has to Plan for the future. Recently the State Government has also scraped Regionwise quota system under Health Sciences admissions on implementation of NEET. Therefore, for equitable growth and distribution of Health Science education facilities in a State, the district is considered as a Unit for development under this sixth Plan. Taking into consideration the difference between Urban a nd Rural Area population and geographical conditions under one district in respect of population density, transportation facilities, Health Services availability, Industrialization of the area, employment, Profession or source of income of family, per capi ta income, every district unit is divided in two sub -units namely; Municipal corporation area and Non municipal corporation area under S ixth Plan. The distribution of Health Science institutions districtwise and subunit wise is thus more suitable for consi deration of equity and equivality. In last fifth Perspective Plan (2017 -22) period, some proposals were not recommended to the State Govt. as in that Plan there was no provision for opening of new College(s) due to certain conditions. The number of such pr oposals was approximately 43. Now in Sixth Plan due to restructuring of unit, subunit, population and the present recommendations , there are chances that some of these proposals, if examined according to the new perspective plan, become eligible to be reco mmended to State Government by MUHS. Hence after publication of this Plan, the concerned management may apply to the University , for reconsideration of previous proposals. After receiving request from the concerned management, the University will scrutinize such cases and if found eligible in light of the new rules, by following due procedure shall recommend such Colleges proposals to the State Government on priority basis. Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 18 District wise Perspective Plan: In each sector of development, if smaller areas are considered, then each one of them has better chance of availability of facilities. This is true for Health Science education also. It has been observed that, if deficit is calculated region wise and a Health institution is allotted to that region, then there are always chances that these will be available in few selected districts of that region. Hence, the Colleges that have come up during Fifth Perspective Plan are thos e only from certain districts of particular region. When the Fifth Perspective Plan came in to existence faculty wise and district wise Colleges came in to existence as : Faculty Medical Dental Ayurved Unani Homo. -- * * * * Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 19 A) Starting of New Colleges of Health Science Education : 1. The management which proposes for the establishment of new institutions must fulfill all the conditions as laid down in the University Act, the rules and regulations laid down by the University. It is desirable that such organizations have t he experience of managing successfully institutions of similar nature. In addition they must also have the experience of running a hospital with prescribed number of beds, OPD, IPD and infrastructure as per concerned Central Council(s) / Commission(s) / Un iversity norms applicable from time to time. 2. The management which proposes for the establishment of new institutions must give undertaking along with application form that they have gone through the relevant provisions under all applicable Acts includin g council / Commission act, rules and regulation and notification etc., Perspective Plan and University directions issued from time to time regarding opening, closing, affiliation, increase in intake capacity for affiliated College. 3. The geographical mu nicipal corporation area and district area will be considered as valid area as declared by State government from time to time. 4. The population of zone under any district will be considered valid population for the purpose of this Plan will be as per data available with District Collector office or State government from time to time. 5. Institutions / Colleges those who had already applied for Starting of New Colleges / New Post Graduate Courses / Increase in Intake Capacity but could not obtain Essential ity / No Objection Certificate, from Maharashtra Government in that particular Academic Session, should apply for revalidation of the proposal by paying of prescribed fees. Such proposals can be revalidated for Five Academic Sessions. After six (1+ 5 years revalidation ) Academic Sessions, such proposals will be treated as Closed and such institution / College(s) will have to apply afresh with prescribed fee. As and when the proposal is closed, (i.e after Six years from date of recommendation of proposal to the State Government.) the same will be informed to the State Government. 6. Those Institutions / Colleges, who have received Consent of Affiliation for opening of New College / starting new PG course(s) / Increase in Intake Capacity but could not obtain permission from Central Government within one year from the date of its issuance, should apply for extension of Consent of Affiliation by paying fee as per the Prescribed Ordinance / Notification . The proposal will be reviewed and Consent of Affiliation shall be Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 20 extended till the Validity of initial / renewed Essentiality Certificate issued by the State Government. However , those institutions / Colleges who have not received Permission from Central Govt. / Central Council within Six years from the date of recommendations of proposal to the State Government, then that proposal will be treated as closed and such Institute / College will have to apply a fresh with prescribed fees. As and when the proposal is closed, (i.e after Six years from date of recommend ation of proposal to the State Government.) the same will be inti mated to the concerned Central C ouncil /Commission . 7. If the Management Council directs to return the proposal for Starting of New Colleges / Courses / Increase in Intake Capacity, then the proposal will be returned by deducting 10% amount of the prescribed affiliation fee. 8. For proposal(s) under Hilly area / Tribal area on specified by State Government (for this purpose all parts proposed initiate, including its applicable course, if any should be in such areas) only 50% affiliation fees will be charged as a Incentive/ Promotive measure compare to proposal for corporation area. 9. Backlog of vacancy position of establishment of Colleges in the previous Perspective Plan i.e. 2017 -2022 will be carried forward in the next Perspective Plan i.e. 2022 -27. 10. Vacancy of establishment of a College will be treated as fulfilled after final permission received from Central Govt. / Central Council / Commission and permission of State Govt. for Allied Faculty. B) Increase in Intake Capacity: In order to strengthen the existing Colleges and to ensure the viability of Colleges, the proposal of such Colleges will be recommended for the increase in intake capacity, provided such Under Graduate / Post Graduate Colleges / Institutes fulfills the norms for existing courses as per respective Central Councils / Commission and whose first batch has been passed out from those Colleges. C) Upgradation of Existing Institutions : 1. The College and hospitals un dertaking teaching and training extend better Health services, if they are upgraded to the level of Post Graduate facilities. The Health Science education institutions, especially of modern medicine located at district places will therefore be permitted to upgrade for Post Graduate and Super Specialty Institutions at revenue divisional Headquarters. This will provide access to better Health care for the people of particular region. Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 21 2. In view of the continuously growing need for nursing and allied Health m anpower for the State, the proposals for establishing such course(s) in the Colleges belonging to the respective faculty will be promoted. 3. In addition to equity in quantity, it is also necessary that the equity in quality be achieved across the regions. The quality of Health Science education is determined by per capita expenditure on patients, student teacher ratio, patient in flow, equipment and the infrastructure. Currently there is an acute shortage of suitable teachers in some institutions specially , those located in rural areas. There is also vast disparity in per capita expenditure on creating and running the Health Science institutions across the regions. Therefore it is proposed that: - (a) Of all these, quality of teachers and adequacy of teacher s in terms of numbers is being encouraged by the University and strict adherence to Central Council / Commission norms. In addition, there are many subjects in different faculties where appropriate posts do not exist. Therefore, it is proposed that the exi sting vacancies from full time cadre must be filled expeditiously. (b) To create suitable teachers by providing the opportunities of upgradation of knowledge and skill of individual teacher. To create suitable system of appointment for the teachers, the suitable method may include such systems as honorary system, part time system, visiting teachership, contributory lecturers, adjunct teachers in addition to the existing system wherever necessary as per Council / Commission norms. D) Post Graduate and Super -specialty Education In Health Sciences: Since all Under Graduate degrees of the University of All Pathies are recognized by the respective Central Councils / Commission and all Health Sciences Post Graduate courses, Super specialty & Ph.D. are affili ated from the Conventional Non -agricultural Universities to this University by the Government Ordinance IX, 2005, dated 31st October 2005. Maharashtra is one of the leading progressive States in India. Post graduation and its further specialization in a subject plays a significant role in the health scenario of the State. The University, being the University of Health Sciences, it endeavors i n the fulfillment of the needs of Health Sciences to the people vis -a-vis developing the quality in Health Sciences education with reference to teachers, students and medical professionals in the State. Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 22 Keeping this in mind, the University strives to prom ote Postgraduate and Super Specialty Education with quality research in all disciplines in the University and affiliated Institutes. This policy measures will help to alleviate the critical shortages in Health care system and also upgrade hospital faciliti es. Various post graduate courses in all faculties are run in most of the Health Sciences Colleges. Colleges desirous to apply for starting new Post Graduate courses must have sufficient teaching staff and infrastructure like number of beds and technical staff as per respective council norms and also first batch of Under Graduate course must be passed out in all respect and College must be recognised by respective councils / Commission for degree course. In respect of Medical Colleges, the College / Insti tute which is not yet recognized by Medical Council of India / National Medical Commission for the award of M.B.B.S. degree, may apply for starting of a Post Graduate course in Pre -clinical and Para Clinical subjects of Anatomy, Physiology, Bio -chemistry, P harmacology, Forensic Medicine and Community Medicine at the time of third renewal i.e. along with the admission of fourth batch of M.B.B.S. course. University proposes to prepare and publish a separate vision document to maintain quality in Medical Educ ation & Health Sciences Research. * * * * * Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 23 Annexure -1 Ranking of Districts by Population Size Rest of Maharashtra Sr. No. Districts Population Estimate d % of population Ranking order of Population Estimated Estimated 2001 2011 2021 2001 2021 201 1 2021 1 Mumbai 3338031 3085411 13829698 2.74 09 01 2 Mumbai 9356962 17 16 7 1.45 16 15 8 1.82 62.85 Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 24 Marathwada : Sr. No. Districts Population Estimate d % of population Ranking order of Population Estimated Estimated 2001 2011 2021 2011 Vidarbha Sr. No. Districts Population Estimate d % of population Ranking order of Population Estimated Estimated 2001 2011 2021 2011 2021 2011 2021 1 Nagpur 1.15 08 08 3 1.08 09 09 4 Grand 100 Perspective Plan 2022 - 2027 Page 25 Annexure -2 Region wise Percentage population Sr. No. Development Board No. of Districts in the Board % to total population of State Population Census Estimated Estimated Year 2011 Year 2021 Year 2011 Year 2021 1 Rest of 2022 - 2027 Page 26 Annexure -3 Municipal Corporation Population Sr. No. Municipal Corporation Districts 2011 Estimated 2021 1 Mumbai Mumbai City District , Mumbai 2022 - 2027 Page 27 Annexure -4 Region wise Population density per Sq.Km.
