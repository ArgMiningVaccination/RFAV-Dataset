Infrared therapy is a safe, drug-free and very effective way to achieve long-lasting pain relief and treat many conditions. The Far Infrared Crystal Healing mat is a revolutionary healing tool. It is a medical device that combines far infrared light and negative ion technology along with the healing power of amethyst crystals. Infrared heat warms us the best, penetrating deep into our bodies to actually heat the cells and blood vessels. This helps blood flow and carries oxygen more efficiently. Far infrared mats are extremely soothing and gentle. They are a safe way to increase circulation, cellular metabolism and to achieve deep relaxation. How does it work? This unique, effective and healing energy mat converts energy into infrared ray waves that penetrate deep into muscle tissue to facilitate profound healing. The device emits negative ions that energize, deeply relax and refresh the body and mind. Far infrared rays are pure energy in the form of light waves from the invisible area of the electromagnetic spectrum. Far infrared heat is the most beneficial light wave, penetrating deeply into the body and can move right through clothing and bandages. Far infrared light deeply penetrates 6-8 inches into the body, benefiting the muscles, lymphatic system, glands blood vessels, and nerves. It warms the body, improving circulation and enzyme activity. It also detoxes the body of harmful toxins and acid wastes Negative ions are invisible particles that are abundant near waterfalls, rain forests and oceans. They are molecules with an extra electron that help to alleviate allergies, migraines and sinus issues. Once they reach the blood stream, negative ions have a positive effect on the rate which serotonin is oxidized in the bloodstream, resulting in increased mental energy and function. Amethyst has the power to bolster the production of hormones and can strengthen the circulatory and immune systems while boosting metabolism. Amethyst soothes the nervous system, aids in the transmission of nerve signals and helps improve memory. What are the benefits? After only 30 minutes on the infrared mat, blood flow is increased by 400 percent! This boost will last for hours after the therapy. You will experience a large amount of relief, relaxation, and warming. Additional benefits will include, increased perspiration, enhanced calorie burning, excretion of toxins and immune system stimulation. The deep penetrating heat of the infrared rays helps peripheral blood vessels to dilate bringing relief and healing to soft tissue pain and injury. This superficial heat penetrates skeletal muscle, smooth muscle and connective tissues in a gentle, yet effective way. Infrared heat also reduces soreness on nerve endings and muscle spasms as muscle joints and fibers are heated and relaxed. Nitric oxide is a short-lived gas that is crucial to the health of your arteries. Infrared therapy prompts the release of nitric oxide which enhances blood flow in the immediate vicinity of the infrared therapy. This boost in blood flow brings oxygen and nutrients to injured, tired, aching tissues resulting in faster and more lasting healing. It also significantly reduces pain and inflammation. Infrared therapy is an amazing stress reliever and improves well-being and can also help heal injured or damaged body parts. What are the benefits of Infrared therapy when combined with massage?
