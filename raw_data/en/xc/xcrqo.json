Shelters and housing programs are largely full, many with long waitlists. For the first time in decades, there is no walk-in, low-barrier homeless shelter in Anchorage.

Now, two years later, the video-sharing site has replaced both schoolwork and the activities he used to love \u2014 like composing music or serenading his friends on the piano, she said. \"He just has to have his YouTube,\" said Garcia, 56, of West Los Angeles.

Doctors Can Do More To Treat It ](https://nmindepth.com/2022/every-door-is-the-right-door/) By 2013, Steve Harbin's alcohol problem was plain to nearly everyone. Once a prosperous salesman in the construction industry, he'd lost his job and health insurance. Gone were the dream house he'd designed in Albuquerque's foothills and many of the motorcycles he'd owned. The last one, a Kawasaki W650 with a peashooter exhaust, sat in his garage in disrepair. (Alcorn, 7/24) [ New Mexico In Depth: Paying The Tab: Scientists Say Policies Can Help The State Cut Excess Drinking, But Lawmakers Listen To Alcohol Interests Instead ](https://nmindepth.com/2022/paying-the-tab/) Alcohol costs New Mexico dearly. It killed 1,878 residents in 2020, three times the nation's rate. But getting hammered here is cheap. At the Shop-N-Save on Gallup's west side, a thirty-rack of Natural Ice beer sells for $24.95 after tax, a little over two hours' earnings at minimum wage. Total Wine in Santa Fe offers a five-liter box of Franzia Crisp White wine for $15.15, or 45 cents per drink. And you can't do better than Wal-Mart in Rio Rancho, where a 1.75-liter handle of Aristocrat vodka sells for $11.84, just 30 cents a drink.

A woman without housing asked around for a place to stay the night. A downcast man in nurse's scrubs said he had relapsed but hoped to go home that night, if his wife would have him. New Mexicans can't neglect the state's enormous alcohol problem even if they want to.

USA Today and The Atlantic cover developments in a scandal over key Alzheimer's research into amyloid proteins. [ NPR: Scientists Map Changes In The Brain To Better Treat Alzheimer's Disease ](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/08/01/1113825311/alzheimers-researchers-are-looking-beyond-plaques-and-tangles-for-new-treatments) After decades of focusing on the sticky amyloid plaques and tangled tau fibers associated with the disease, brain researchers are searching for other potential causes of impaired memory and thinking. That search is on full display this week at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in San Diego, where sessions are exploring factors including genes, brain injury, clogged arteries and inflammation. (Hamilton, 8/1) [ ScienceDaily: A Diabetes Drug Could Protect Against Alzheimer's ](https://scitechdaily.com/?p=191230) According to a study from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden that was published in the journal Neurology, mechanisms connected to a specific diabetic medication may also help protect against Alzheimer's disease. The findings suggest that the target protein of the drug may be a promising candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. (8/1) [ CNN: The Fight Against Alzheimer's: Where Are We Now? ](https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/health/alzheimers-progress-wellness/index.html) With so many genes contributing to the development of Alzheimer's and other types of dementia, scientists are convinced that each person's journey may be different. \"There is a saying: Once you have seen one person with Alzheimer's, you've seen one person with Alzheimer's,\" said Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic in the Center for Brain Health at Florida Atlantic University's Schmidt College of Medicine. (LaMotte, 7/31) And a scandal over Alzheimer's research continues to simmer \u2014 [ USA Today: Alzheimer's Theory Under Scrutiny After Accusation Of Research Fraud ](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/07/29/alzheimers-theory-scrutinized-accusation-fabricated-research/10142926002/) The article centered on a Vanderbilt University neurologist's investigation of images used in the 2006 research paper on the discovery of a type of protein called amyloid beta star 56. Dr. Matthew Schrag concluded published images used to support the research were likely altered, though he stopped short of calling the research fraud, noting he did not have access to the original unpublished images or underlying data. His research was performed outside his duties at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

To make its pages, work must be deemed exceptionally important, with potentially transformative impact on scientific understanding. In 2006, a study of Alzheimer's disease by the lead author Sylvain Lesn\u00e9 met those criteria: It suggested a new culprit for the illness, a molecule called A*56, which seemingly caused dementia symptoms in rats. The study has since accrued more than 2,300 citations in the scientific literature and inspired years of follow-up work. But an investigation of the original paper and many others by Lesn\u00e9, described last week in Science, identified numerous red flags indicating the possibility of data fraud. (Nature has added a note to the paper, saying that the work is under investigation and that its results should be treated with caution.)

[ The Washington Post: Indiana's Cruel Abortion Bill Is A Warning Of Post-Roe Reality ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/07/31/indiana-abortion-bill-cruel-new-reality/) On Saturday, the Indiana Senate voted to make abortion illegal in the state. The measure passed with the bare minimum number of votes \u2014 not because lawmakers flinched at outlawing abortion but because so many of them believed the bill, with its exceptions for rape and incest, wasn't strict enough.

This condition, she was told by her doctor, correlated with a wide variety of disabilities that could cause the baby to die at birth. The doctor told my mother that she could seek an abortion. She wanted her to know her options.

The party's lack of compassion on the topic is harmful. There is a growing mismatch between the party's stance on abortion and the complex beliefs voters in this country have on abortion.

And mysterious. Over the course of my two pregnancies, more than 40 physicians and midwives, by my count, failed to explain why my blood work kept coming back with so many anomalies, why so many debilitating complications kept piling up in an otherwise healthy woman.

It was either a moment of crisis, doctors rushing into a room, all sound and fury and chest compressions for minutes that felt like hours. Or it was something quieter, entirely divorced from machines, family gathered for the last breaths when the lungs were failing, or the cancer had spread too far. (Daniela J.
