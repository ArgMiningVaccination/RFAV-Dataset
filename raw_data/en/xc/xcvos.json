Grant Programs, AS 47.30.520-620 The Community Mental Health Services Act; and AS 47.376, Uniform Alcoholism and Treatment Act. Description of Services: Support existing organizations seeking to expand into rural areas, or to allow for community mental health centers in rural areas to add peer support to their existing service delivery system, or maintain peer support organizations developed through the Beneficiary Project Initiative. The intent is to promote growth and institutionalization of peer support in behavioral health systems outside Anchorage, Juneau, and Fairbanks areas. The Division anticipates the following outcomes: increased number of peer support organizations actively serving members/individuals in rural communities and improved client quality of life outcomes for individuals engaged in peer support services. Assessment of Need: Peer support is a recognized best practice in behavioral health. Individuals who have completed treatment or are successfully managing their recovery are often very successful in engaging and supporting their peers in the recovery process. Having trained peer support workers in rural areas would help alleviate the workforce issues faced by rural areas in the recruitment and retention of qualified behavioral health staff from other areas. These positions would also provide local, meaningful employment for peers, an important component of recovery. Service Delivery Area: Statewide other than Anchorage, Juneau and Fairbanks.

Description of Services: The Alcohol Safety Action Program services are intended for adult and juvenile clients who have a current or pending misdemeanor criminal case with the Alaska Court System for driving while intoxicated and/or other alcohol and drug related misdemeanor cases. Services provide case management and accountability to clients by: 1) screening criminal cases referred from the district court into drinker classification categories and; 2) managing misdemeanor alcohol offender cases to ensure their required substance abuse education or treatment program are completed, as prescribed by the courts. Assessment of Need: The Alcohol Safety Action Program is an integral part of the Alaska Court System and the Behavioral Health continuum of care, providing invaluable and necessary substance abuse services in all major communities throughout Alaska. Maintaining our current Alcohol Safety Action Program system of service in our major Alaskan communities is vital to our goal of reducing alcohol use, abuse and dependency across our state. Service Delivery Area: Service areas include Juneau, Ketchikan, and Barrow.

Description of Services: Bethel 's Community Service Patrol (CSP) will patrol the town, picking up inebriated individuals and deliver them to the appropriate facility for assessment. If needed, CSP will transport them to the Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation (YKHC) Sobering Center where they can sober up in an environment that provides monitoring and protection. Individuals taken to the YKHC Sobering Center will also be screened and receive case management services that connect them to services, such as referrals for Substance Abuse or Mental Health assessments and treatment. Assessment of Need: The Bethel region has been identified by the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority (AMHTA) as a target area for specialized chronic inebriate services due to the large number of Title 47 protective holds that result in people being taken to local correctional facilities or hospital emergency rooms. Neither of these facilities have the capacity to provide services for those needing care. The CSP is an integral part of a multi-faceted service system designed to provide protection, identification, and referral for treatment for the targeted population. The YKHC Sobering Center provides a more appropriate and preferable setting, than the local correctional facility or emergency room. Service Delivery Area: Bethel Service Area. Available data documenting incarcerations associated with protective custody holds demonstrates that the City of Bethel has one of the highest incidences of protective holds in the State. Because of this, the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority and Division of Behavioral Health have identified the region as a priority for additional program efforts.

Description of Services: Program services will assist and support efforts to reduce and prevent substance use and abuse, suicide, and self-destructive behavior. The overall goal of this program is to support coalition-lead community-based activities across Alaska by reducing risk factors and harmful consequences of substance abuse and poor mental health, and to promote protective factors to empower communities to create population-level change in behavioral health conditions including those related to COVID 19. Increasingly, integrated Behavioral Health services requires a broader view of substance use and mental health problems and to look more holistically and to partner with initiatives that target interpersonal violence, trauma, primary care and physical health issues. Assessment of Need: The Comprehensive Behavioral Health Prevention and Early Intervention (CBHPEI) program is an integral part of the Behavioral Health continuum of care. This program funds coalitions to initiate and support community based training, education and other behavioral health strategies throughout Alaska to increase shared protective factors among individuals, families, and communities in order to reduce substance abuse and misuse, and local challenges. This network of coalition-lead initiatives operates at the local, regional, and state levels and is vital for promoting a safe and healthy environment for children and families across the state and results in reduced health care costs and a lower burden on the legal and criminal justice system.

Description of Services: The Comprehensive Behavioral Health Treatment and Recovery (CBHTR) program is operated to ensure Alaskans have access to a statewide continuum of behavioral health (mental health and substance use disorder) services across the lifespan. The CBHTR program coordinates community-based, person-centered services and supports for abstinence and improved health, wellness, and quality of life for those with, or at risk of behavioral health issues. CBHTR may include all behavioral health program service types supported with grant funds, across settings, in the following categories: Psychiatric Emergency Services; Withdrawal Management (Detoxification) Services; Residential Treatment Services; Outpatient Treatment Services; Housing Services; Peer & Consumer Supports. Assessment of Need: In the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), 15.3% of Alaskans reported frequent mental distress (14 or more days per month). 18.2% of Alaska Native adults reported frequent mental distress. Alaska 's 2015 suicide rate of 27.1/100,000 was over twice the 12.32/100,000 U.S. rate. Alaska Natives complete suicide at 2.4 times the rate of non-Alaska Natives. 15.7% of all Alaskan adults and 22.6% of Alaska Native adults reported active marijuana use. Of Alaskans 12 years and older, 1.23% reported heroin use in the past year. Alaska Native youth ages 10-17 years old are 2.7 times more likely to be hospitalized for unintentional alcohol poisoning than a non-Alaska Native peer. Alaska has the 10th highest prevalence rate of adult binge drinking in the U.S. and the fifth highest rate of intensity of adult binge drinking. The Alaska Native adult rate of alcohol-related mortality is 3.5 times (71.4/100,000) that of all Alaskan adults (20.4/100,000) and is 8.4 times the national rate (8.5/100,000). 22% of the SFY 2012 correctional population experienced a mental health disorder and 19% experienced a chronic substance use disorder. 66% of Alaskan adults report one or more Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) growing up with one or more adults experiencing behavioral health issues, which for children translates to more expensive acute care and chronic conditions later in life. Service Delivery Area: Statewide, by DOH Regions, or by Alaska Medicaid Section 1115 Behavioral Health Demonstration Waiver Regions according to need.

Required mitigation services include the following: Provide case management and outreach services. Provide behavioral health services and ensure youth have access to primary care health providers. Support youth in gaining/maintaining employment and/or resources or services to gain or resume independent living following resolution of COVID-19 issues. Actively monitor or provide monitoring to residents for symptoms (temperature > 99.0\u00b0 F, oxygen saturation, etc.) or changes in symptoms. Provide appropriate guidance to mitigate exposure and spread of COVID-19. Provide or facilitate supervised transportation to/from quarantine, testing, and medical care. Assessment of Need: During the pandemic, Alaska has had a very high incidence of COVID-19 cases and infection rates, among the highest in the nation. COVID-19 has disproportionately affected the homeless and especially homeless youth who are at higher risk of exposure, infection, hospitalization, and mortality. Service Delivery Area: Service delivery areas are Anchorage and southeast Alaska.

A COS program provides youth (ages 12-18) or adults (ages 18+) who are in crisis a safe place to go with up to 23 hours of observation and supervised care to de-escalate the crisis, provide prompt assessment and determine the appropriate level of care. CSS provides a safe home-like environment and 24/7 medically monitored care and stabilization services for a period of one to seven days to restore children (ages 11 and under), youth (ages 12-18), or adults (ages 18+) to a level of functioning that does not require hospitalization. Assessment of Need: With the 1115 Medicaid Waiver, Alaska sought to expand the services of the crisis response continuum to include COS and CSS. Agencies have enrolled to provide these services, but we have yet to see a notable increase in functional crisis stabilization facilities to serve children (under age 11), youth (12-18) and adults who are experiencing BH or SUD crises. Currently Alaska 's crisis continuum of care is characterized by an over-reliance on the use of emergency rooms. COS and CSS programs will decrease the dependence on emergency room care while increasing places to go for children, youth and adults in crisis.

Assessment of Need: The current national crisis of COVID-19 has greatly impacted the ability of individuals with serious mental illness, substance use disorders and/or co-occurring serious mental illness and substance use disorder to obtain treatment. In addition, this crisis is expected to contribute to the growth in the number of individuals struggling with depression, anxiety, trauma and grief.

Research has demonstrated that early, appropriate treatments and supports can help to prevent the full onset of illness for persons in a high-risk state, and to improve long-term outcomes for those who have already had a first episode of psychosis. Services are a team-based, multi-modality approach to treating First Episode Psychosis. Component interventions include community outreach, assertive case management, individual or group psychotherapy, supported employment and education services, family education and support, and low doses of select anti-psychotic agents. Assessment of Need: National research has demonstrated that approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults experience First Episode Psychosis each year. Service Delivery Area: Given the low incidence of youth with early psychosis, the First Episode Psychosis model requires a service area population size of at least 100,000. Expectations of numbers served once a team is fully functional is 15 to 25 depending on the size of the community.

Description of Services: Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) is a specific Evidence Based Practice characterized by availability of comprehensive support services in integrated community settings (coupled with affordable rent) and is a crucial resource for many people with a behavioral health diagnosis that has interfered with successful housing tenancy and community integration. Housing with supports provides a stable base for recovery, which can be difficult for individuals who are experiencing homelessness, living in unnecessary restricted/segregated settings, and re-entering the community from institutional settings. The comprehensive array of active treatment services provided through this grant program include, but are not limited to: assertive outreach and engagement to bring individuals into services including camp outreach to homeless individuals; inreach to individuals with multiple admissions to Alaska Psychiatric Institute (API) and/or other institutions, linkage to affordable housing and housing stability services, employment support/job skills training; substance abuse treatment and coordination; mental health treatment and coordination; referral to primary care services; activities of daily living services and training; medication management and monitoring; detoxification services; relapse prevention and recovery planning; and illness management and recovery. PSH-Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) will provide treatment, services and supports through a multi-disciplinary team and in accordance with the evidence based practice of ACT as demonstrated by meeting fidelity through regular fidelity reviews to individuals who are high users of institutionalization and other intensive levels of care. This differs from the Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program in that PATH only provides outreach and engagement. Hence a separate program is needed. Assessment of Need: Individuals with physical or mental illness and substance use are highly represented in the chronically homeless population. One criteria of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) definition of chronic homelessness is that the individual has a disability in addition to experiencing homelessness. Alaska participates annually in the nation Point in Time Count (PIT) which uses surveys of people in encampments, homeless shelters, soup kitchens, etc. to estimate the number of homeless people in communities and nationwide. The 2018 PIT count for Anchorage identified 1,094 individuals who were homeless with 43% of families identifying as Alaska Native and 20% self-identified as experiencing serious mental illness and/or substance use disorders. The Balance of State (BOS) which includes counts from outside of Anchorage identified 922 homeless individuals with 53% of homeless families identifying as Alaska Native and 37% self-identified as experiencing serious mental illness and/or substance use disorders.

Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) is a federal grant program under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)'s Homeless Division. As such these funds can only be used as per the purpose and requirements of the SAMHSA PATH program. Assessment of Need: Individuals with physical or mental illness and substance use are highly represented in the chronically homeless population. One criteria of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) definition of chronic homelessness is that the individual has a disability in addition to experiencing homelessness. Alaska participates annually in the nation Point in Time Count (PIT) which uses surveys of people in encampments, homeless shelters, soup kitchens, etc. to estimate the number of homeless people in communities and nationwide.

The Balance of State (BOS) which includes counts from outside of Anchorage identified 922 homeless individuals with 53% of homeless families identifying as Alaska Native and 37% self-identified as experiencing serious mental illness and/or substance use disorders. This grant funding provides outreach and engagement to our most vulnerable individuals who are homeless. This is an activity that is not reimbursable though Medicaid but facilitates access to housing and treatment services, as well as providing assertive outreach activities that have been proven to reduce hospitalizations and incarcerations.

This ensures quick access and linkage to screening, assessment, admission to substance use and co-occurring disorder treatment, primary health care, employment, housing, etc. Assessment of Need: Pregnant women and parenting women often have significant substance use histories with little access to intervention or treatment services. Some have Office of Children's Services (OCS) involvement and are in need of residential and/or outpatient SUD treatment in order to stabilize and maintain or regain custody of their children. Pregnant women with SUD's need treatment during their pregnancy to protect the unborn child and following birth of the child to maintain their recovery and practice good parenting skills. All pregnant and parenting women with substance use issues need guidance, support and linkage to relevant services and resources.

Residential Care for Children and Youth services include emergency shelter, specialized residential care, staffed secure care, residential diagnostic treatment, and residential sex-offender treatment. Lengths of stay range from one day to approximately a year or more. A strong emphasis is placed on service delivery to children in their own communities whenever possible. Services are intended to achieve immediate and long-term solutions to family problems; promote the preservation, rehabilitation, and reunification of families to the extent possible; and to promote independence and the use of least restrictive alternatives. Services are provided for children and youth with behavioral health residential treatment needs, and to stabilize and assess for needs including the rehabilitation of juvenile offenders and treatment of victims of child abuse and neglect. Assessment of Need: Under AS 47.14.100, the Department must arrange for the care of every child committed to its custody by placing the child in a foster home or in the care of an agency or institution providing care for children inside or outside the state. The same statute allows the Department to pay necessary costs to ensure adequate care.

ASAM level 3.2 withdrawal management consists of clinically managed residential withdrawal management. This level of care is sometimes referred to as social detox. It consists of 24 hour observation or support for individuals who are intoxicated or experiencing withdrawal. This level of care is characterized by its emphasis on peer support rather than on medical care, however medical care and consultation must be available 24 hours a day as needed. ASAM 3.7 Withdrawal management is a medically monitored inpatient service. This level of care provides for 24 evaluation and withdrawal management in a permanent facility with inpatient beds. Services are delivered by medical and nursing professionals under a defined set of physician- monitored procedures or clinical protocol. Assessment of Need: The need for new or expanded withdrawal management services is evidenced by the number of requests for it received by DBH, the length of wait lists at the current residential withdrawal management facilities, and the number of individuals in need of residential withdrawal management who end up in hospital emergency rooms. Service Delivery Area: The service areas and communities requested for the services solicited are Statewide.

Description of Services: This program offers grants to rural substance abuse, mental health, behavioral health, and human services agencies, and to urban agencies serving people who are traveling or have relocated from rural areas. The program was developed in response to the critical need for a stable system of behavioral health providers in rural Alaska by hiring, training, supporting, and supervising culturally competent village-based counselors and counselors that serve relocated villagers. This program provides the opportunity for rural people to achieve their goal of helping their own people. Training is provided through the Rural Human Services Training Program in the University of Alaska College of Rural Alaska from one of its designated Rural Human Services campuses and supports a range of degree programs from a two-year certificate to Masters Degree of Social Work. Assessment of Need: This program seeks to address the problem of scarcity of counseling and crisis intervention resources in the villages of rural Alaska and to reduce the costly reliance on itinerant service providers and employees who come from outside of a community, only to stay a year or less. The goal of the project is to ensure there is \"a counselor in every village\" as well as secondary behavioral health specialists where needed to provide continuity of care and consistency in community-level services. Service Delivery Area: Eligible applicants include rural substance abuse programs, community mental health centers, and other human services agencies, and to urban agencies serving people who have relocated from rural areas.

Funds will be awarded to support the operations of recovery housing projects including but not limited to rent, utilities, and basic supplies for residents. All awards under this grant program are operating grants intended to support operations and services; they cannot be used for purchase of real property or facilities, renovations, or purchase of major fixed or movable equipment such as vehicles. Applicants may propose basic household furnishings or equipment with a per unit value of less than $5000 and a useful life expectancy of more than one year. Assessment of Need: Over the last several years, Alaska has seen a dramatic rise in opioid misuse and opioid overdose related deaths. In 2017, 144 drug overdose deaths occurred in Alaska, 100 of which were opioid related. Opioid overdose deaths show an increase trending from 72 deaths in 2013 to 100 in 2017. Individuals who complete treatment are often unable to find affordable housing in an environment which supports their recovery. Outcome studies show the longer an individual remains in a treatment or recovery environment, the greater their chances of sustaining long-term recovery. Recovery housing is associated with numerous positive outcomes including decreased substance use, reduced probability of relapse, lower rates of incarceration, higher income, increased employment, and improved family functioning.

A sobering center allows impaired individuals to safely become sober and encourage their connection to outpatient services, primary care, housing and other community supports based on proper use of evidenced based screening tools. Sobering centers ensure safety for an at-risk population and reduces emergency room visits related to substance use, which in turn, alleviates the frequency of holds at correctional facilities. Sobering centers are especially vital to the life and health of Alaskans during cold winter months in which intoxication mixed with freezing temperatures can lead to cold- related injuries and deaths. Typical services offered at sobering center facilities include, but are not limited to: medical clearance, a bed to sleep in, screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT). Assessment of Need: Substance use disorders (SUDs) have long been identified as one of Alaska 's pre-eminent community health and social services problem. Addiction and misuse of alcohol and other drugs is one of the leading causes of disease and premature death in Alaska and is the single greatest contributor to traumatic injury and death in the State. Sobering centers are a vital component of the continuum of SUD care by providing a space to safely manage intoxication as well as serving as a conduit to treatment. Despite being a vital part of the continuum of care, sobering centers do not meet ASAM criteria (3rd Edition, 2013) for withdrawal management services, nor are they treatment facilities. For this reason, funding through billable services is limited. Medicaid does not cover sobering center services, therefore, grant funds are currently the only funding stream that can fill the gap. Screening services are covered by Medicaid and sobering centers are starting to integrate screening into their programs to have a Medicaid stream to aid in sustainability.

The program will expand the operations of recovery residences and develop a standard under which they will operate, to include the establishment of up to six residencies statewide. Funds will be awarded to support the operations of houses including but not limited to rent, utilities, and basic supplies for residents. Grant projects will be expected to address fiscal, operation, recovery supports, property, and good neighbor standards. Assessment of Need: Alaska had 253 drug overdose deaths in 2021, compared to 146 in 2020. That represents an overdose death rate of 35.2 deaths per 100,000 people in 2021, compared to an overdose death rate of 20.2 deaths per 100,000 people in 2020. In 2021, the overdose death rate for men was 42.9 deaths per 100,000 people, while the rate for women was 26.9. Alaska had 196 opioid overdose deaths in 2021, which was an increase from 102 in 2020. That includes 145 deaths that involved fentanyl. Fentanyl was involved in 58 deaths in 2020. Methamphetamine was involved in 154 overdose deaths in 2021, up from 62 in 2020.

Description of Services: This is an evidence-based program funded with General Fund/Mental Health. Services provided promote self-sufficiency among adults experiencing severe mental illness (SMI) and/or a co-occurring disorder related to substance abuse. Supported Employment is characterized by rapid placement into integrated employment settings of an individual's choosing and capabilities, with commensurate wages and long term supports as needed and wanted by an individual. Assessment of Need: Supported Employment is an evidence-based best practice with robust research demonstrating a correlation between employment and recovery from the most serious mental illnesses. Through this program, employment services have been developed to increase the number of clients engaging in supportive employment activities. It helps them attain independence, improve their quality of life, and attain employment that is beneficial to themselves, their families, and the community.

Description of Services: Under the Therapeutic Court Program, the agency provides a range of services integrating behavioral treatment, sanctions, and incentives with case processing. The focus is on a high-risk population of chronically dependent clients and/or individuals with a co- occurring mental health disorder. Assessment of Need: The Therapeutic Court Program seeks to solve underlying problems that generate repeated encounters with the criminal justice and behavioral health system. In a 2007 report, Criminal Recidivism in Alaska, the Alaska Judicial Council found that graduates of therapeutic courts were rearrested and re-convicted far less frequently than comparison offenders. In the study, the Council followed graduates for one year after they completed their program and a comparison group of offenders for one year after they were released from serving their sentence. Service Delivery Area: The service areas and communities to be served are primarily Anchorage, Bethel, Fairbanks, Juneau, Ketchikan, and Matanuska- Susitna Borough, and may include outreach to other communities seeking to establish a therapeutic court program locally. Individuals receiving services will be referred by the Therapeutic Courts.

Mother to mother support has been shown to be one of the most successful approaches to promoting breastfeeding. The WIC Breastfeeding Peer Counseling program (BFPC) is a targeted approach to provide mentorship on breastfeeding and encourage WIC participants to breastfeed. Assessment of Need: Pregnancy and early childhood are critical periods of growth and development. By providing access to healthy foods, nutrition education and breastfeeding support, the WIC program improves the heath of nutritionally at risk, low-income women, infants, and children. Research has shown that participation in the WIC program results in longer pregnancies, fewer premature births, fewer infant deaths, and savings in health care costs from $1.77 to $3.13 for every one dollar spent on WIC services. WIC services have been available to eligible families throughout Alaska for decades. In 2014 the WIC service delivery model was changed to limit the number of WIC grantees to one grantee per Service Area with the aim of streamlining WIC services for increased efficiency. Conversely, though the number of eligible WIC participants has remained relatively stable around 30,000 individuals, actual WIC enrollment has dropped from approximately 20,000 in SFY 2014 to less than 15,000 in 2021, a decline in participation of more than 25%. The WIC program intends to improve quality and accessibility by: 1) increasing the number of WIC grantees in Service Areas with more than 2,500 potential eligible participants and 2) encouraging co-location of WIC clinics with healthcare providers.

Activities must be evidenced-based and delivered through individual or group-based strategies, comprehensive multi-level interventions, and/or community and public health approaches. SNAP -ED efforts may also address environmental and policy-level interventions. National, State, and local coordination and collaboration is strongly encouraged and recommended. Assessment of Need: In an effort to expand activities, leverage limited funding by identifying communities with limited access to health or physical information, and reduce prevalence of obesity in low-income areas, SNAP-ED was incorporated into Family Nutrition Programs.

Funding is to help alleviate strain on Community Health Centers resulting from medical homes for seniors who have been refused care by private practice physicians due to low Medicare reimbursement rates. Assessment of Need: In this current and growing primary care crisis for seniors with Medicare as primary insurer, seniors are being refused care by physicians due to Medicare's low reimbursement rate. In some parts of Alaska, Community Health Centers are often the only providers available and/or willing to see Medicare patients. During the 2016-2017 grant years, 9,455 Medicare enrollees (approximately 11.3% of Alaska's Medicare enrollees) received services through the Senior Access Program provided by more than 13 Community Health Centers throughout the state.

Trained parent educators visit homes to support and build on parent and caregiver strengths, while teaching about optimal early childhood developmental learning. Grantees will be required to be a PAT Model Affiliate or will complete a plan to become an affiliate in the first grant year. To become an affiliate, agencies must meet the 20 essential components of the PAT model, which ensures each affiliate meets the minimum expectations for program design, infrastructure, and service delivery. Affiliates must also be able to offer all components of the PAT model, which includes personal visits, a resource network, group connections, and developmental screenings. For the purpose of program evaluation, a grantee must share data as needed with DHSS, DPH, and WCFH in order to evaluate the efficacy of the program. Assessment of Need: In order to support children as they grow through the most critical stages of development, it is important to help parents increase their knowledge of early childhood development and improve parenting skills. Early detection of developmental delays and health issues can help reduce child abuse and neglect and by investing in early childhood through improved healthy development and prevention of maltreatment, it is possible to improve children 's readiness to succeed in school and life.

Description of Services: The Positive Youth Development Afterschool Grant Program will fund community-based and state wide prevention programs that reduce initiation of marijuana use by minors, promote cessation of marijuana use among minors, reduce access of minors to marijuana products, reduce exposure of minors to impaired driving dangers from marijuana use, and enhance individual, family, school, and community protective factors that foster healthy development. Assessment of Need: According to the 2017 Alaska Youth Risk Behavior Survey data, youth state-wide who take part in after-school activities are 29% less likely to have used marijuana in the past month. Extensive research has shown an individual's social condition, personal traits, genetic disposition, and life experience are associated with different types of healthy or unhealthy behavior. These social and personal influences are defined as risk and protective factors. Numerous risk and protective factors affect youth substance abuse, delinquency, and other risk behaviors. The more risk factors an adolescent has at the individual, family, school or community level, the more likely s/he is to engage in risk behaviors. The more protective factors present in an adolescent 's life, the more likely s/he is to engage in pro-social and developmentally-healthy behaviors. For example, youth who experience adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), witness family members engaging in substance use, and live in disconnected or transient communities are more likely to engage in risk behaviors themselves. On the other hand, youth who have a positive self-concept, are engaged in meaningful activities, and are connected to their families and other adults in their community are more likely to avoid risk behaviors. Service Delivery Area: Rural, urban, and state-wide youth serving organizations. Eligible applicants include local governments, schools, nonprofit organizations, state agencies, and institutions of higher education.

Services include participation with the Division in ongoing statewide risk assessment and gap analyses, and the development and implementation of target capabilities identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Target capabilities for healthcare system preparedness and recovery include, though are not limited to: emergency operations coordination; information sharing; mass care; fatality management; responder safety and health; and medical materiels management and distribution, including medical surge and dispensing of countermeasures. Assessment of Need: Alaska's ability to effectively respond to large scale public health emergencies, natural disasters, and man-made hazards is imperative as the public health system plays a critical role in such emergencies. An effective, broadly developed and coordinated emergency response lessens the impact of such incidents and contributes significantly to community and individual resilience following such incidents. Service Delivery Area: Service delivery is statewide for preparedness services to benefit all Alaskans.

Services include prevention and control of infectious and non-infectious diseases through immunizations, screening, testing, treatment, contact investigation, education and outreach; public health emergency preparedness and response activities; outreach to families and children at medical and social risk; referral and linking of individuals and families with needed services; and direct provision of health services when they are otherwise unavailable. Assessment of Need: Currently we do not have state-run public health centers in the proposed service delivery areas. Grants with the three governing bodies within these proposed areas are deemed the most effective and appropriate means of providing area-wide public health nursing services. A disruption in the delivery of these services would place residents at increased risk of infectious disease and would reduce preventive health services available to high-risk/medically underserved women and young children. Service Delivery Area: The Municipality of Anchorage proposed service delivery area includes the Municipality of Anchorage and the Girdwood, Eagle River, and Chugiak communities.

Grantees will work collaboratively with health care providers, health educators and Alaskans at risk of unintended pregnancies. Assessment of Need: Both teen and unplanned pregnancy are closely linked to a host of critical social issues that Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) aims to address, such as poverty, lack of education, high levels of relationship conflict and family turmoil, father absence, single parenthood, and various negative social, health, and economic outcomes for children born as a result of such pregnancies. Alaska Pregnancy Risk and Monitoring System (PRAMS) data from 2012-2014 indicates that of women under 20 years old, 71% of pregnancies resulting in a live birth were unintended, compared to 43% of women aged 20-24. Most notably, Alaska consistently ranks highest for Chlamydia rates in the US since 2000 (State of Alaska, Division of Public Health; Section of Epidemiology, 2017). Alaska also has high gonorrhea rates. In 2016, 15-19 year olds accounted for 9.63% or 140 cases per 100,000 persons. Alaska ranks the highest in rape incidence annually in the US (FBI Statistics, 2016). 59% of adult females had a lifetime prevalence of intimate partner or sexual violence (National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, 2015). Intimate partner violence can impact a young woman 's reproductive and sexual health, increasing the risk for unintended pregnancies, abortions, miscarriage and HIV or STD infection (Silverman et al., 2001). Service Delivery Area: Services will continue to be provided by two partner agencies, the Reproductive Health Clinic at the Department of Health and Human Services, Municipality of Anchorage, and The R.E.C.

Services must include, but are not limited to: comprehensive reproductive health exams, breast and cervical cancer screening, pregnancy testing, counseling and screening for sexually transmitted diseases and counseling and provision of contraceptive methods. In addition to clinical services, grantees must offer client education and referral to other local agencies for all primary health care needs and other clinical procedures and screening or diagnostic tests not performed on site. The broad range of services paid for with Title X monies strictly prohibits abortion as a method of family planning. As a recipient of federal Title X funding, the grantee must follow Title X policies and procedures for determining eligibility of clients for discounted services, as well as meeting the Title X Program requirements of a clinical services delivery site. Assessment of Need: Many regions of the state, rural and urban, contain communities with high rates of teen and unintended pregnancies, due in large part to lack of reliable access to affordable, confidential family planning and women 's health services. Although Anchorage and the Kenai Peninsula have historically had the highest demand for program services, this procurement will explore the statewide interest, infrastructure capacity, and cost-effectiveness of providing Title X services in locales not previously served.

Description of Services: The Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRC) program serves as an unbiased resource for information and assistance related to long term services and supports to seniors, people with disabilities, and to their caregivers and families. Core functions include information, referral and assistance, options counseling, streamlined benefits screening, person-centered transition support, as well as outreach and training. Additionally, all individuals seeking Medicaid funded support through Senior and Disability Services (SDS) will be required to complete the Person-Centered Intake process through the ADRC program to help streamline the process. In FY2022, the ADRCs took action to expand access to COVID-19 vaccines to serve all populations. Funding provided resources to activities related to vaccine access, such as, scheduling vaccine appointments, transportation to vaccine sites, direct support services needed to attend to attend vaccine appointments, connection to in-home vaccination options, and provided education to older adults and people with disabilities about the importance of receiving the vaccine. In addition, these funds enabled the aging and disability networks to identify people who were unable to independently travel to vaccination sites and provided technical assistance to local health departments on improving access to vaccines for people with disabilities and older adults. These services will continue into FY24. The Division will solicit for an additional ADRC site as a mid-year solicitation in FY23. Assessment of Need: As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, federal COVID Cares funding was awarded to the ADRC program in FY21 to cover costs associated with the pandemic. With a growing senior population and rising costs for long term support services, the need for easily accessible, unbiased information, as well as expertise concerning available options and supported decision making, is an increasingly essential service. As SDS streamlines the process of accessing Medicaid funded services, the ADRC's will play an integral role in completing the person-centered intake form for each person seeking long term assistance. Beginning in FY2019, the ADRCs will serve as the entry point for all SDS Waiver services. As the COVID-19 crisis continued into FY2022, additional federal funding was provided under the ADRC/NWD COVID-19 Vaccine Access Supplemental Funding program to all ADRCs to ensure all Alaskans had access to the COVID-19 vaccine. These services will continue into FY24. Service Delivery Area: ADRCs currently serve Anchorage, Kenai/Valdez/Cordova, Southeast Alaska, Bristol Bay/Kodiak, and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. Additionally, in FY2019, the Fairbanks Northstar Borough was also be served by an ADRC.

Description of Services: This project will focus on the development and utilization of engagement and intake strategies which will increase the success of Early Intervention/ Infant Learning Program (EI/ILP) projects in engaging highly stressed caregivers in intake, screening and evaluation activities, and enrollment in EI/ILP services, if eligible. This project will work to remove barriers to participation by tailoring family engagement strategies for this group of children and families. These pre-enrollment activities will be designed to increase engagement of this often transient and reluctant group of families who have children who are at increased risk of developmental delays, disabilities, and early mental health/social emotional concerns. Target population for this project include infants and toddlers, ages birth to three years, who experience social, environmental and prenatal risk factors which put them at high risk of experiencing a disability. This includes Homeless children, and Child Abuse Protection and Treatment Act (CAPTA) referrals of children under the age of three who were the subject of a substantiated case of child abuse or neglect. Approximately 25% of referrals into the Alaska Early Intervention/Infant Learning Program are for families involved in the Child Protection System. Families who experience significant social risk factors including homelessness, violence in the home, child abuse or neglect, parental substance abuse, lack of social supports, teen parents, and others, can be especially challenging to engage in EI/ILP Services. This may be due to lack of trust in service delivery systems, families who are overwhelmed with the stressors of daily living, transportation and communication challenges, and more. The project will work to remove system barriers and identify sustainable funding to support the work after grant funding fades over time.

Assessment of Need: The goal of Health Promotion, Disease Prevention, funded through Administration on Aging Title III-D, is to improve health and wellbeing of older Alaskan populations and to reduce costs of acute and long term care. Alaska has an increasing population of adults aged 60 and older. Most older adults have at least one chronic condition and many have multiple conditions. Adults over age 60 are increasingly likely to fall, which can result in loss of independence and entry into institutional care. Prevention activities, including self-management of chronic conditions, falls prevention, physical activity, and medication education, improve emotional and physical health, wellbeing, and sustain the ability to carry out activities of daily living so the person can remain at home.

Description of Services: Medicare Counseling and Outreach (MCO) grants provide coordination of Medicare outreach, counseling, referral, and data-entry activities consistent with the State Health Insurance Assistance Program and Senior Medicare Patrol grants. As an extension of the Medicare Information Office, they provide one-on-one Medicare counseling and public media outreach to seniors and people with disabilities. Counseling and referral is performed both on-site and over the phone, and outreach is provided off-site at community locations and events. Assessment of Need: Availability of Medicare counseling and information for beneficiaries is essential for accessing necessary health care and medications. Demand for Medicare Counseling and Outreach has increased with the expanding senior population in Alaska. Grants under this program increase the capacity of the Division of Senior and Disabilities Medicare Information Office to the growing population. Service Delivery Area: Funding will leverage existing certified Medicare counselors to support and assist the State Medicare Information Office in providing information to the largest populated areas of the state, and also to beneficiaries statewide.

Description of Services: The National Family Caregiver Support (NFCS) program provides support to unpaid caregivers of individuals age 60 or older, persons with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders (regardless of age), and grandparents (age 55 or older) raising children no older than 18. NFCS services include providing information about available services, providing assistance in gaining access to services, individual counseling, organization of support groups, caregiver training, respite care, and supplemental services on a limited basis. Assessment of Need: Family caregivers provide over $450 billion per year in unpaid long term care services. The value of family caregivers will likely continue to be the largest source of long-term care services in the United States as the population over age 65 increases. Providing support to family caregivers may increase the length of time caregivers are able to care for their loved one at home.

Description of Services: Senior In-Home (SIH) Services provide case management and in-home services to eligible seniors who do not qualify for Medicaid Waiver services and need assistance with activities of daily living. The goal of the program is to support Alaskan seniors so that they may remain in their homes and communities for as long as possible thereby forestalling or eliminating more costly institutional care. Services include Case Management, Chore, Respite, Extended Respite and Supplemental Services (up to $500 per household per year for items or services that support the \"low-income \" senior in avoiding a crisis that would jeopardize their ability to remain independently in their home). Assessment of Need: These services offer a safety net for low income seniors who do not meet the level of care for the Home and Community Based Medicaid Waiver program, especially those with Alzheimer 's Disease and related disorders (ADRD). By providing case management and in-home assistance, the SIH program is able to extend the time an individual can live independently in their own home and communities and reduce the need for costly institutional care. This continues to be very important as Alaska 's senior population is now the fastest growing per capita in the U.S. Service Delivery Area: Statewide RBB Framework: Department Priorities 1 Health & Wellness Across the Life Span Department Core Services 1.2 Provide Quality of Life in a Safe Living Environment for Alaskans 171 DOH FY 2023 Operating Grants Senior Grantee Service Area(s) DHSS Region(s) Election Alaska, GF/MH $156,267.00 Grant Award of Alaska, Bay, Chugiak, Dillingham, Eagle River, Bay/Kodiak, Southcentral, Yukon/Kuskokwim13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 37, 38, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 31, 32, 37GF/MH $366,397.00 Grant Award 167-311-23002 Total: Grant Award 167-311-23003 Total: $130,326.00 Center for Community, Inc.

These facilities are located in rural areas without long-term care facilities or Pioneer Homes. Services provided by the assisted living homes are available to seniors 60 and over, and individuals who are unable to live alone but can reside in a supervised setting with minimal assistance. Assisted living facilities enable seniors to live in or near their communities, and provide meals and assistance with daily activities such as, bathing, dressing, transferring, and eating. Assessment of Need: Elders who can no longer care for themselves in their own homes and do not have a caregiver to help them, must typically move to Anchorage or another large community to access assisted living care. Services provided by the assisted living homes in Tanana and Galena provide the necessary support for elders to remain close to their homes and communities. Initially, there were three rural assisted living homes providing services in Galena, Tanana and Dillingham; however, the assisted living home in Dillingham has since closed its doors. In FY2022, Elders in the Native Village of Unalakleet will need senior residential services. For years, the Native Village has been building an assisted living home and has recently completed their project. The new 10-bed assisted living home is licensed, certified, and ready to accept Medicaid waiver clients. The new facility has a long waiting list and is in need of funding in order to provide services to the Elders in their community.

Description of Services: The Traumatic or Acquired Brain Injury (TABI) Grant Program includes Resource Facilitation and Peer-Support services. TABI Resource Facilitation includes coordinating resources and care, modeling and teaching independent living skills, and supports individuals living with brain injury to utilize a comprehensive array of services including medical, rehabilitative, social, educational, vocational, in-home, and other needed services to improve quality of life and maintain independence. TABI Peer Support involves individuals with a brain injury receiving support from trained individuals with lived experience with a brain injury or a family member of an individual with a brain injury. Peer support will be offered by grantees who provide TABI Resource Facilitation services. Peer Support will be offered in a group format, 1:1 and via in-person and virtual method. Agencies providing TABI Resource Facilitation, Peer Support, and Supplemental Services will be responsible for conducting outreach with the purpose of educating the community about the availability of services offered through this grant as well as other community resources and completing person-centered intakes on individuals in need of services through the grant. Assessment of Need: Alaska has one of the highest rates of brain injury in the nation. The Alaska Trauma Registry reports that every year approximately 2,500 new traumatic brain injury survivors join an estimated 10,000 to 12,000 Alaskans currently living with brain injury. Additionally, each year approximately 610 Alaskans are hospitalized, 150 individuals die, and an estimated 247 become permanently disabled due to a brain injury. Individuals who have experienced a brain injury have varying degrees of physical, cognitive, behavioral, and functional problems that impact their ability to live independently, causing difficulty gaining access to and utilizing health care providers, housing, employment, transportation, rehabilitation, and other home and community-based supports. Most people with TABI who leave acute care settings are discharged to home, where they piece together the limited supports available, and they may need substantial assistance to regain needed skills. TABI Resource Facilitation, Peer Support, and Supplemental Services will provide a direct link between individuals with TABI and the services and supports that they need to maintain independence and achieve quality of life in their homes and communities.
