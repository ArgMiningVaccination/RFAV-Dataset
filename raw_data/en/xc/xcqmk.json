HRSA is charged with ensuring access to quality health care through a network of community-based health centers, maternal and child health pro-grams, and community HIV/AIDS programs throughout the States and U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, HRSA's mission includes supporting individuals pursuing careers in medicine, nurs-ing, and many other health disciplines. HRSA fulfills these responsibilities, in part, by collect - ing and analyzing timely, topical information that identifies health priorities and trends that can be addressed through program interven - tions and capacity building. HRSA is pleased to present Women's Health USA 2012, the eleventh edition of the Women's Health USA data book. To reflect the ever-changing, increasingly diverse population and its characteristics, Women's Health USA selec- tively highlights emerging issues and trends in women's health. Data and information on ad - verse childhood experiences, Internet use for health information, sexual risk behaviors, and sexual violence are among the new topics in - cluded in this edition. Other topics that have not been covered in the past 5 years include in -carcerated women and impaired fecundity and infertility treatment. In addition, this year's special population pages feature new data on the health of Asian women, rural and urban women, and women veterans.Disparities by sex, race and ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors, including education and income, are highlighted throughout the docu-ment where possible. Where race and ethnicity data are reported, groups are mutually exclusive WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 20125 PREFACE (i.e., non-Hispanic race groups and the Hispan - ic ethnic group) except in a few cases where the original data do not present the groups separate - ly. Throughout the data book, those categorized as being of Hispanic ethnicity may be of any race or combination of races. In some instances, it was not possible to provide data for all races due to the design of the original data source or the size of the sample population; therefore, es - timates with a numerator of less than 20 or a relative standard error of 30 percent or greater were considered unreliable and were not re - ported. The data book was developed by HRSA to provide readers with an easy-to-use collection of current and historical data on some of the most pressing health challenges facing women, their families, and their communities. Women's Health USA 2012 is intended to be a concise ref - erence for policymakers and program managers at the Federal, State, and local levels to identify and clarify issues affecting the health of wom-en. In these pages, readers will find a profile of women's health from a variety of data sources. The data book brings together the latest avail - able information from various agencies within the Federal government, including the U.S. De - partment of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Department of Education, U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Department of Justice, and U.S. Department of Veterans Af - fairs. Non-Federal data sources were used when no Federal source was available. Every attempt has been made to use data collected in the past 5 years. The data included are generally age-adjusted to the 2000 population standard of the United States when there are clear age-related patterns that affect comparisons across various groups, especially those of different races and ethnicities. Age-adjustment helps to see dif-ferences between groups in the prevalence or incidence of a condition that are not simply a function of differences in the groups' age dis - tributions. Women's Health USA 2012 is avail - able online through the HRSA Of-fice of Women's Health Web site at www.hrsa.gov/womenshealth or the HRSA Maternal and Child Health Bureau's Office of Epidemiology and Research Web site at www.mchb.hrsa.gov/researchdata. Some of the topics covered in Women's Health USA 2011 were not included in this year's edition either because new data were not available or because prefer - ence was given to an emerging issue in women's health. For coverage of these issues, please re - fer to Women's Health USA 2011, also available online. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office on Women's Health (www.womenshealth.gov) has detailed women's and minority health data and maps. These data are available through Quick Health Data On-line at www.healthstatus2010.com/owh. Data are available at the State and county levels, by sex, race and ethnicity, and age.

In most age groups, women accounted for approximately half of the population, with the ex - ception of people aged 65 years and older; within this age group, women represented 56.9 percent of the population. The growing diversity of the U.S. population is reflected in the racial and ethnic distribution of women across age groups and time. Non-Hispanic Whites accounted for 79.3 percent of women aged 65 years and older, but only 53.4 percent of those under 18 years of age. Between 2000 and 2010, the Hispanic and non-Hispanic Asian female population grew the most\u2014increasing their proportion of the female population by about 30 percent. Hispanics grew from 12.1 to 15.9 percent of the female popula-tion and non-Hispanic Asians increased from 3.8 to 4.9 percent. By 2050, non-Hispanic White females are projected to no longer be the major - ity (46.1 percent) and about one-third of females will be Hispanic (29.9 percent). America's growing diversity underscores the importance of examining and addressing racial and ethnic disparities in the social determinants of health, health status, and the use of health care services. In 2010, at least one in five non-Hispanic Black (25.5 percent), Hispanic (25.0 percent), non-Hispanic American Indian/Alas - ka Native women (25.0 percent), and non-His -panic Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander women (20.3 percent) were living in households with income below the poverty level compared to just 12.2 percent of non-Hispanic Asians and 10.4 percent of non-Hispanic Whites. Simi - larly, fair or poor health was reported by more than one in five Hispanic (29.5 percent), non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native (26.0 percent), non-Hispanic Black (23.2 percent), and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/Other Pa-cific Islander women (20.8 percent), compared to about 13 percent of non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Asian women. Many minority women are disproportionately affected by sev - eral diseases and health conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure, overweight and obesity, asthma, HIV/AIDS, and sexually trans - mitted infections. For instance, in 2010, rates of new HIV cases were highest among non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native females (41.7, 9.2, and 6.4 per 100,000 females, respectively), compared to just 2.1 cases per 100,000 non-Hispanic White females. Diabetes was nearly twice as common among non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American women (16.5 and 16.9 percent, respectively) than among non-Hispanic White women (8.9 percent). Similarly, obesity was considerably higher among non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American women (58.0 and 44.0 percent, respectively) than non-Hispanic White women (33.1 percent). Although Asian women tend to be healthier, some subgroups may face higher rates of dia-betes, hepatitis infection, and certain types of cancer. For example, in 2006-2010, 12.4 per - cent of Asian Indian women reported having been diagnosed with diabetes compared to 4.7 percent of Chinese women. The receipt of rec - ommended cervical cancer screening was sub-stantially lower among Asian Indian, Chinese, and Other Asian (71.5, 71.6, and 70.2 percent, respectively) compared to Filipina (86.9 per - cent) and non-Hispanic White women (84.6 percent). Cultural differences in health-related beliefs may contribute to this disparity. However, many conditions and health risks are more closely linked to education and fam - ily income than to race and ethnicity and tend to explain a large portion of racial and ethnic health differences. For example, healthy choices for diet and exercise may not be as accessible to those with lower levels of education and income and may contribute to higher obesity levels among minority women. In 2008-2010, over half of college-educated women (57.3 percent) achieved recommended levels of physical activ-ity compared to less than one-quarter of women without a high school diploma (24.4 percent). Fruit and vegetable consumption also increased with educational attainment. For instance, in 2009, about 40 percent of women with a col - WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 20127 INTRODUCTION lege degree ate vegetables three times per day compared to 22.0 percent of those who hadn't finished high school. Health care access also varies greatly by in - come and education. In 2008-2010, about 20 percent of women with incomes below 200 percent of the poverty level had forgone needed health care due to cost compared to 6.5 percent of women with incomes of 400 percent or more of poverty. Only 41.6 percent of women with less than a high school education had a dental visit in the past year compared to 80.9 percent of women with a college degree. In addition to income and education, there are also geographic barriers to health care. For example, rural areas have fewer physicians and dentists per capita than urban areas, and may lack certain specialists altogether. In 2010, ru - ral women were less likely than urban women to have had a past year dental visit (64.4 versus 77.9 percent, respectively). Compared to their urban counterparts, rural women were also more likely to smoke (20.5 versus 14.4 percent, respectively), to be physically inactive (29.2 ver - sus 25.1 percent, respectively) and to be obese (30.4 versus 25.9 percent, respectively). Women veterans are another population group that may face unique health problems due to possible exposure to combat-related stress and trauma. Although women veterans were more likely than civilian women to have had a past-year preventive health visit in 2010 (76.2 versus 72.0 percent, respectively), they were more likely to report limitations in activity due to physical, mental, or emotional problems (29.3 versus 20.7 percent, respectively) and to report poor mental health on 14 or more days in the past month (18.1 versus 12.5 percent, respectively). A variety of conditions increase with age and are more likely to affect older women, including activity limitations, arthritis, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, infecundity, maternal mor-bidity, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's disease. For example, nearly three-quarters of women aged 65 and older had high blood pressure in 2009-2010 and 71.1 percent were overweight or obese. However, some health behaviors and indicators improve with age, such as mental health-related quality of life, the receipt of preventive check-ups, and positive health behaviors prior to preg - nancy. For instance, among recent mothers aged 40 and older, only 12.4 percent reported smok - ing and 15.3 percent reported binge drinking in the 3 months prior to pregnancy, compared to 34.2 and 25.5 percent, respectively, among mothers aged 20-24 years. Older mothers were more likely to have taken daily preconception multivitamins, which dramatically reduce the risk of neural tube defects, and to have intended or planned their pregnancy. Since women live an average of about 5 years longer than men, they are more likely to have certain age-related conditions like Alzheimer's disease. Regardless of age, however, women are also more likely to have activity limitations, asthma, arthritis, osteoporosis, and depression. For example, 9.0 percent of women had osteo - porosis in 2007-2010, compared to 1.3 percent of men. Women also experience more physically and mentally unhealthy days than men. In 2010, women reported an average of 3.9 days of poor physical health, compared to 3.3 days per month for men. Similarly, women reported an average of 4.1 mentally unhealthy days, while men reported an average of 3.0 days per month. Men, nonethe - less, bear a greater burden of certain health con - ditions, such as HIV/AIDS, heart disease, and substance use disorders, and were less likely than women to have received a preventive check-up or dental visit in the past year. Women's Health USA 2012 is an important tool for emphasizing the importance of pre - ventive care, counseling, and education, and for illustrating disparities in the health status of women from all age groups and racial and ethnic backgrounds. Health problems can only be remedied if they are recognized. This data book provides information on a range of indi - cators that can help us track population health determinants, health behaviors, health status, and health care utilization practices of women throughout the United States. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 20128 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS Population characteristics describe the di- verse social, demographic, and economic fea - tures of the Nation's population. There were more than 157 million females in the United States in 2010, representing slightly more than half of the population. Examining data by demographic factors such as sex, age, and race and ethnicity can serve a number of purposes for policymakers and pro-gram planners. For instance, these comparisons can be used to tailor the development and eval - uation of policies and programs to better serve the needs of women at higher risk for certain conditions. This section presents data on population characteristics that may affect women's physi - cal, social, and mental health, as well as access to health care. Some of these characteristics include age, race and ethnicity, education, pov - erty, employment, household composition, and participation in Federal nutrition programs. The characteristics of incarcerated women are also reviewed and analyzed. The population characteristics and health status of rural and ur-ban women and women veterans are examined as special population features. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 20129 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS U.S. Female Population, by Age, 2010 Source I.1: U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 CensusU.S. Population, by Age and Sex, 2010 Source I.1: U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 Census 45-54 Years 14.6%65 Years and Older 14.6%Under 18 Years 23.1% Years 35-44 Years 25-34 Years 18-24 Years Under 18 Years Total5,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,000140,000150,000160,000U.S. POPULATION In 2010, the U.S. population was more than 308 million, with females comprising 50.8 percent of the total population. Females younger than 18 years accounted for nearly one-quarter of the 157 million U.S. females, while women aged 18-34 years accounted for 22.6 percent, those aged 35-64 years accounted for 39.7 percent, and women aged 65 years and older accounted for 14.6 percent. The distribution of the population by sex was fairly even across younger age groups; however because women have longer life expectancies, they represented a greater proportion of those aged 65 years and older. Women accounted for 56.9 percent of all individuals aged 65 years and older, 60.8 percent of individuals aged 75 years and older, and over two-thirds of individuals aged 85 years and older (data not shown). WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201210 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS U.S. FEMALE POPULATION In 2000, more than two-thirds of the total female population was non-Hispanic White (69.5 percent), followed by non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic females (12.6 and 12.1 percent, respectively). By 2010, the proportion of the fe - male population that was non-Hispanic White dropped to 63.8 percent and the proportion Hispanic increased to 15.9 percent. By 2025, non-Hispanic White females are projected to account for 57.7 percent of the female popula-tion and by 2050 they are projected to no lon - ger be the majority (46.1 percent). By 2050, the proportions of females who are Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian, and non-Hispanic multiple race are expected to double or triple compared to the start of the millennium. The increasing diversity of the U.S. popula - tion is a function of different fertility, mortality, and migration patterns according to race and ethnicity. The younger female population (un - der 18 years) is significantly more diverse than the older female population (data not shown). In 2010, 53.4 percent of females under 18 years of age were non-Hispanic White, while 23.2 percent of that group were Hispanic. In con-trast, among women aged 65 years and older, 79.3 percent were non-Hispanic White and only 7.0 percent were Hispanic. 1 The increasing diversity of the U.S. popula - tion underscores the importance of promoting racial and ethnic equity in health and health care. Significant racial and ethnic disparities persist in health status and access to health care which can be attributed to a variety of social, behavioral, environmental, and biological de -terminants. 2 The future health of America will greatly depend on using a multifaceted approach to improving the health of racial and ethnic mi-norities and other disadvantaged groups. 10203040506070 Non-Hispanic Multiple RaceNon-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/ Other Non-Hispanic Ages), by Race/Ethnicity, 2000-2050* Source I.2, I.3: U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division *Totals may not sum to 100 percent due to rounding, and the exclusion of non-Hispanic females of other races.2000 2025 Projection 2050 Projection201069.5 63.8 0.83.84.96.18.1 0.10.20 .2 0.21.21.82.03.0 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201211 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION In 2011, 48.5 percent of women aged 18 years and older were married and living with a spouse; this includes married couples living with other people, such as parents. About 13 percent of women over age 18 were the heads of their households, meaning that they have children or other family members, but no spouse, living with them. Women who are heads of households in - clude single mothers, single women with a par - ent or other close relative living in their home, and women with other household compositions. More than 17 percent of women lived alone, 15.5 percent lived with relatives, and 5.5 percent lived with non-relatives.Household composition varies significantly by age. Young women aged 18-24 years were most likely to be living with relatives (59.7 percent) and with non-relatives (12.1 percent). About 60 percent of women aged 35-44 and 45-64 were living with a spouse. Being a head of house - hold with no spouse present was most common among women between the ages of 25 and 44. Older women, aged 65 and above, were most likely to be living alone (37.3 percent) with an - other 43.5 percent living with a spouse. In 2011, non-Hispanic Black women were most likely to be single heads of households with family members present (27.5 percent), while non-Hispanic Asian and non-Hispanic White women were least likely (7.5 and 9.4 percent, respectively). Over 30 percent of female single heads of households with family members had household incomes below the poverty level (see Women in Poverty). Same-sex couples accounted for 646,464 households in 2010, representing an 80.4 percent increase since the 2000 Census. 3 However, same- sex couples still account for fewer than 1 percent of all households (0.6 percent). Female couples comprised 51.5 percent of same-sex households. 4 Almost one-quarter of female same-sex couple households contained children (23.9 percent) compared to 10.0 percent of male same-sex cou-ple households and about 40 percent of opposite-sex couple households (data not shown). 3,4 612182430 Non- Hispanic Multiple RaceNon-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Hispanic American Indian/ Alaska Native Hispanic Non- Hispanic BlackNon- Hispanic WhiteWomen Aged 18 and Older Who Are Heads of Households with Family Members,* by Race/Ethnicity, 2011 Source I.4: U.S. Census Bureau, Current P opulation Su rvey *Includes the civilian, non-institutionalized population.

In comparison, 11.2 percent of adult men lived in poverty (data not shown). With regard to race and ethnicity, non-Hispanic White women were least likely to experience poverty (10.4 percent), followed by non-Hispanic Asian women (12.2 percent). In contrast, about one-quarter of Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women lived in poverty. Poverty status varies with age. Among wom - en of each race and ethnicity, those aged 45-64 years and 65 years and older were less likely to experience poverty than those aged 18-44. For instance, 30.0 percent of non-Hispanic Black women aged 18-44 were living in poverty in 2010, compared to approximately 20 percent of those aged 45 years and older. Poverty status also varies with educational attainment. Among women aged 25 years and older in 2010, one-third (33.2 percent) of those without a high school diploma were living in poverty, compared to 15.6 percent of those with a high school diploma or equivalent, 10.5 per - cent of those with some college and 4.6 percent of those with a Bachelor's degree or higher (data not shown). In 2010, 11.7 percent of families\u2014a group of at least two people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together\u2014were living in poverty. Married-couple families were least likely to be poor (6.2 percent). Among single-headed households with no spouse present, those headed by an adult female were twice as likely to be poor as those headed by an adult male (31.5 versus 15.6 percent). Overall, wom - en in families were more likely than men to be poor (11.5 versus 7.9 percent; data not shown). 816243240 Female-Headed Families, No Spouse PresentMale-Headed Families, No Spouse PresentMarried-Couple FamiliesAll FamiliesFamilies* Living Below the Poverty Level,** by Household Type, 2010 Source I.5: U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Su rvey, Annual Social and Economic SupplementWomen Aged 18 and Older Living Below the Poverty Level,* by Race/Ethnicity and Age, 2010 Source I.5: U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Su rvey, Annual S ocial and Economic Supplement Percent of Women *Families are groups of at least two people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. **Poverty level, defined by the U.S. CensusBureau, was $22,314 for a family of four in 2010. *Poverty level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $22,314 for a family of four in 2010.Percent of Families31.5 15.1 5.815.6 11.7 6.2 Years WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201213 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS FOOD SECURITY Food security is defined as having access at all times to enough nutritionally adequate and safe foods to lead a healthy, active lifestyle.6 Food security status is assessed based on individuals' responses to questions such as whether an indi - vidual worried that food would run out before there would be money to buy more; whether an individual or his/her family cut the size of meals or skipped meals because there was not enough money for food; and whether an individual or his/her family had ever gone a whole day with - out eating because there was not enough food. Households or persons experiencing food insecurity may be categorized as experiencing \"low food security\" or \"very low food security.\" Low food security generally indicates multiple food access issues, while very low food security indicates reduced food intake and disrupted eating patterns due to inadequate resources for food. Periods of low or very low food security are usually recurrent and episodic rather than chronic. Nonetheless, nutritional risk due to poor dietary quality can persist across periods of food insecurity, and may increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies and diet sensitive condi - tions like hypertension and diabetes. 7 In 2010, an estimated 17.2 million or 14.5 percent of all households experienced food inse - curity among one or more household members at some point in the past year; this rate has not changed significantly since 2008 and remains at the highest level documented since measure - ment began in 1998. 8 However, the prevalence of very low food security declined slightly from 5.7 percent in 2009 to 5.4 percent in 2010. Food security status varies by household com - position. While adult men and women living alone had similar rates of food insecurity in 2010, female-headed families with no spouse present were more likely than male-headed families with no spouse present to experience food insecurity (35.1 versus 25.4 percent, respectively). Female-headed families were also more likely than male-headed families to experience very low food secu-rity (10.8 versus 6.7 percent, respectively).

The Supple- mental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly the Federal Food Stamp Program, helps low-income individuals and families pur - chase food. In 2010, following an economic re - cession, the number of people served by SNAP hit a record high of 39.8 million per month, on average. Of the 21.2 million adults served, over 13 million (62.8 percent) were women (data not shown). 9 Between 1990 and 2010, the number of people served by SNAP tracked strongly over time with the number of people in poverty, demonstrating the critical role of SNAP in responding to need. In 2010, 1.7 million children and 2.2 million adults, 61 per-cent of whom were women, were lifted above the poverty line after adding the value of SNAP benefits to household income. 10 Among the households that relied on SNAP in 2010, 4.6 million (25.2 percent) were female-headed households with children, accounting for 51.8 percent of all SNAP households with children (data not shown). 9 The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) also plays an important role in serving low income women and families by providing supplementa-ry nutritious foods, nutrition education, and re-ferrals to health and other social services. WIC serves pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women, as well as infants and children up to age 5. In 2011, more than three-quarters of all indi - viduals receiving WIC benefits were infants and children (76.6 percent); however, the program also served nearly 2.1 million pregnant women and mothers, representing 23.4 percent of WIC participants. In contrast to SNAP , WIC is not an entitlement program that guarantees benefits to all eligible applicants. However, funding for WIC has increased over the years, and the num - ber of women, infants, and children served by WIC has increased by over 100-fold between 1974 and 2011, from 88,000 to 8.9 million (data not shown). 11 SNAP Participants and Individuals in Poverty, 1990-2010 Sources I.7: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Stamp Quality Control Sample; U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Su rvey, Annual Social and Economic Supplement 1020304050Individuals in Poverty SNAP Participants 2010 2008 2006 2004 2002 2000 1998 1996 1994 1992 1990Number in Millions39.846.2Participants in WIC, 20 11* Source I.8: U.S. of Agriculture, WIC Pr ogram Pa rticipation Data *Based on Federal Fiscal Year (October to September)Women 23.4% Infants 23.5%Children (Age 1-4 Years) 53.1% WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201215 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT In 2009, 89.8 percent of female and male young adults aged 18-24 had earned a high school or general equivalency degree; this is an increase from the 1972 level of 82.3 percent (data not shown). 12 While there has not been a sex disparity in high school educational at-tainment, a large disparity in post-secondary educational attainment has been eliminated or reversed over the last four decades. In 1969-1970, men earned a majority of every type of post-secondary degree, while in 2008-2009, women earned more than half of all associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees, and nearly half of all first professional degrees. The most significant increase has been in the pro - portion of first professional degree earners who are women, which jumped from 5.3 percent in 1969-1970 to 49.0 percent in 2008-2009. Al - though the sex disparity in degrees awarded has disappeared or reversed, there are still disparities by discipline. For example, women are under - represented in science and technology and over-represented in education and nursing. 13 There are also racial and ethnic disparities in educational attainment. Although slightly more than one-third of all young adult women had a college degree in 2008-2010, this ranged from 15 percent or less of Hispanic, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander women to more than 60 percent of non-Hispanic Asian women. Hispanic and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native young adult women were most likely to lack a high school diploma (27.6 and 14.9 percent, respectively). Education con - fers great benefit to health status both through greater knowledge of risk and protective factors, as well as the economic resources to facilitate healthy behaviors. 14 Increasing educational at- tainment will depend, in part, on improving school quality and the affordability of college. 102030405060708090 Doctoral Degree**First Professional Degree*Master's Source I.10: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey *Includes fields of dentistry , medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, public health, law , and theological professions. **Includes Doctor of Philosophy degree and degrees awarded for fulfilling specialized requirements in professional fields such as education, musical arts, and engineering.

Among mothers with chil - dren under 18 years of age, 71.3 percent were in the labor force in 2010, up from 47.4 percent in 1975 (data not shown). Labor force participation is higher among mothers with older children and those who are unmarried or separated. 15 Following the recession of 2007-2009, the average annual rate of unemployment (not em-ployed and actively seeking employment) for persons aged 16 and older in 2010 was 9.6 per - cent, reaching the highest level since 1983. The unemployment rate was lower among women than men in 2010 (8.6 versus 10.5 percent, re - spectively) and during the previous three reces - sions. Women's employment has been less sensi-tive to recent recessions because of their greater representation in growing occupations, such as health care. 13 Although women had lower levels of unemploy - ment in 2010, the median weekly earnings of full-time workers aged 25 and older was $170 more for men than women ($874 versus $704). Earnings rise dramatically with increasing education but the gender gap in earnings persists with female full-time workers earning about 75 cents for every dol - lar earned by male full-time workers at every level of education. For example, while women with a high school diploma or equivalent earned a weekly average of $543 in 2010, their male counterparts earned an average of $710. Only about half of the gender pay gap can be explained by differences in industry and occupation. 16 Despite the gender gap in earnings, families are increasingly dependent on the employment and income of women. From 1967 to 2008, the number of families with mothers serving as breadwinners increased from 11.7 to 39.3 percent. 17 Breadwinner mothers include single mothers who work and married mothers who earn as much as, or more than, their husbands.

This includes 1,499,573 men and 112,822 women, resulting in incarceration rates of 943 and 67 per 100,000, respectively. While men are more likely to be incarcerated than women, women have seen a greater incarceration rate increase than men from 2000 to 2010 (13.6 versus 4.3 percent, respectively; data not shown). 18 Among both women and men, there contin- ue to be substantial racial and ethnic disparities in incarceration. For example, non-Hispanic Black women are more than twice as likely to be incarcerated as non-Hispanic White women (133 versus 47 per 100,000 women, respec - tively). Rates also vary with age, peaking among women aged 30-34 years at 175 per 100,000 (data not shown). Compared to their male counterparts, fe - male prisoners serving State sentences of more than a year were more likely to be incarcerated for property and drug-related offenses and less likely to be incarcerated for violent crimes. In 2009, nearly 30 percent of women prisoners were incarcerated for property crimes, including burglary and fraud, and 25.7 percent were in - carcerated for drug offenses, while less than 20 percent of men were incarcerated for either type of offense. By contrast, over half of male pris - oners (54.4. percent) were serving sentences for violent crimes including murder, manslaughter, or assault, compared to 35.9 percent of female prisoners. Incarcerated women often enter the crimi- nal justice system either already suffering from, or at risk for, a wide range of chronic physi - cal, mental, and behavioral health challenges including sexually transmitted infections and HIV, substance abuse disorders, and depres - sion. Further, a majority of female prisoners are of reproductive age and may be pregnant or parenting when incarcerated. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists rec-ommends that incarcerated females be treated according to the same standards of care for non-incarcerated individuals with an emphasis on identifying and treating infectious diseases and mental health needs. 19 Percent of PrisonersRate Per 100,000 PopulationIncarceration Rate* Under State and Federal Jurisdiction, by Race/Ethnicity and Sex, 2010 Source I.12: Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Prisoner St atistics Pr ogram and Federal Justice St atistics Pr ogramOffenses of Sentenced Prisoners* Under State Jurisdiction, by Sex, 2009 Source I.12: Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Prisoner St atistics Pr ogram, Na tional Corrections Reporting Program and Na tional Inmate Su rvey 3,074 77 67943 133 *Counts based on prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year; percentages may not total to 100 due to rounding. **Includes weapons, drunk driving, court offenses, commercialized vice, morals anddecency offenses, liquor law violations, and other public-order offenses.

Studying trends in health status can help to identify new issues as they emerge. In this section, health status indicators re - lated to health behaviors, morbidity, mortal - ity, and maternal health are presented. New topics include adverse childhood experiences, impaired fecundity and infertility treatment, sexual risk behaviors, sexual violence, and sleep health. In addition, special pages are devoted to summarizing the health of Asian women, rural and urban women, and women veterans. The data throughout this section are displayed by various characteristics including sex, age, race and ethnicity, education, and income. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201219 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH BEHAVIORS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Regular physical activity is critical for people of all ages to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, prevent chronic disease, and promote psychological well-being. In older adults, physi-cal activity also helps to prevent falls and improve cognitive functioning. 1 The 2008 Physical Activ- ity Guidelines for Americans state that for sub - stantial health benefits, adults should engage in at least 2\u00bd hours per week of moderate intensity (e.g., brisk walking or gardening) or 1\u00bc hours per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activ - ity (e.g., jogging or kick-boxing), or an equivalent combination of both, plus muscle-strengthening activities on at least 2 days per week. Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond this amount. 1In 2008-2010, 15.8 percent of women met the recommendations for adequate aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity, compared to 23.0 percent of men. Women were much more likely to have engaged in adequate amounts of aerobic activity, however, compared to muscle-strengthening activity (42.2 versus 19.2 percent, respectively). With regard to aerobic activity, about one in five women engaged in an inadequate amount of activity (21.9 percent) and more than one-third reported being inactive (35.9 percent). Inactivity tended to decrease as level of education increased, while the reverse was true for adequate activity. For instance, 57.9 percent of women with less than a high school diploma were inactive, com - pared to 20.1 percent of women with a college degree. Similarly, about one-quarter of women who did not graduate high school engaged in ad - equate aerobic activity, compared to 57.3 percent of women with a college degree. The proportion of women engaging in aerobic activity also varied with race and ethnicity. Near - ly 50 percent of non-Hispanic Black and Hispan - ic women reported being inactive in 2008-2010 (48.6 and 48.4 percent, respectively), compared to less than one-third of non-Hispanic White women (31.0 percent). More than 40 percent of non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women also reported being inactive (data not shown). This is particularly important because of strong evidence linking sedentary behavior with the onset of multiple chronic diseases. 1 Percent of WomenAerobic Physical Activity Levels* Among Women Aged 18 and Older, by Level of Education, 2008-2010 Source II.1: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Na tional Health Interview Survey *Adequate aerobic activity is defined as 2.5 hours per week of moderate-intensity activity or 1.25 hours perweek of vigorous intensity activity, or an equivalent combination of both; inadequate activity is defined asmoderate or vigorous activity for 10 minutes or more per week but less than then recommended level foradequate activity; inactive is defined as no leisure-time aerobic activity that lasted at least 10 minutes.*Adequate aerobic activity is defined as 2.5 hours per week of moderate-intensity activity or 1.25 hours perweek of vigorous-intensity activity, or an equivalent combination of both; adequate muscle-strengtheningactivity is defined as performing muscle-strengthening activities, such as lifting weights or calisthenics,on 2 or more days per week; all estimates are age-adjusted.Adequate Physical Activity* Among Adults Aged 18 and Olde r, by Activity Type and Sex, 2008-2010 Source II.1: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional Health Interview SurveyPercent 60 100College DegreeSome CollegeHigh School or EquivalentLess than High SchoolTotalInadequate Activity Adequate Activity 35.9 42.2 21.9 57.9 17.7 24.4 45.5 20.9 33.5 31.8 44.1 24.1 57.3 22.6 20.1 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201220 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH BEHAVIORS NUTRITION The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends eating a variety of nutrient-dense foods while not exceeding caloric needs. Nutri-ent dense foods include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats and poultry, eggs, beans and peas. In particular, the U.S. Department of Ag - riculture's MyPlate recommends that fruits and vegetables should account for half of foods con - sumed daily. 2 In 2009, less than than one-third of adults in the United States reported consuming fruit two or more times per day (32.5 percent) and veg - etables three or more times per day (26.5 per - cent; data not shown). Women were more likely than men to have consumed fruit at least twice daily (36.1 versus 28.8 percent, respectively) and vegetables at least three times daily (30.9 and 21.3 percent, respectively; data not shown). Among women, fruit and vegetable consump - tion varied by education, race and ethnicity, and Body Mass Index (BMI). Women without a high school diploma were least likely to have reported consuming vegeta - bles three or more times per day (22.0 percent), while those with a college degree were most likely to have done so (38.6 percent). Simi - larly, more than 40 percent of college-educated women consumed fruit twice or more daily, compared to about one-third of women with lower levels of education. With regard to race and ethnicity, only about one-quarter of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women consumed vegetables three or more times daily (24.5 and 23.8 percent, respectively) compared to more than 32 percent for all other races and ethnici-ties (data not shown). Obese women (BMI 30) also had lower fruit and vegetable consumption than those who were neither overweight nor obese (BMI <25). For instance, only 31.6 percent of obese women consumed fruit two or more times per day, compared to 39.3 percent of women who were neither overweight nor obese. Diets high in fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of many chronic diseases, and fruits and veg - etables generally have fewer calories than other foods, which can contribute to better weight management. 2Percent of Wo menDaily Fruit and Vegetable Consumption Among Women Aged 18 and Older, by Weight Status,* 2009 Source II.2: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System *Neither overweight nor obese is defined as having a BMI of less than 25.0; overweight is defined as having a BMI between 25.0 and 29.9; and obese is defined as having a BMI of 30.0 or more.Daily Fruit and Vegetable Consumption Among Wo men Aged 18 and Older, by Level of Education, 2009 Source II.2: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Percent of Wo men 1020304050 College GraduateSome College or Technical 30.9 32.0 24.930.769.141.238.6 34.1Vegetables Three More Times Fruit Two or More Times 1020304050 Obese Overweight Neither Overweight nor Obese32.436.039.3 32.0 31.3 31.6 28.1Vegetables Three or More Times Fruit Two or More Times WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201221 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH BEHAVIORS ALCOHOL USE Ethyl alcohol is an intoxicating ingredient found in beer, wine, and liquor which is pro - duced by the fermentation of yeast, sugars, and starches.3 According to the 2010 Dietary Guide- lines for Americans, when alcohol is consumed it should be in moderation and limited to no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. 2 While moderate alcohol consumption may have health benefits2 - depending, in part, on the characteristics of the person consuming the alcohol - excessive drinking can lead to many adverse health and social consequences including injury, violence, risky sexual behavior, alcoholism, unemploy-ment, liver diseases, and various cancers. 4Excessive drinking includes binge and heavy drinking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines heavy drinking as consum - ing more than one drink per day on average for women and two drinks per day on average for men. Binge drinking is defined as drinking four or more drinks on a single occasion for women and five or more drinks on a single occasion for men (usually over the course of about 2 hours). 3 In 2009-2010, men were more likely than women to report both heavy drinking (8.5 ver-sus 7.3 percent, respectively) and binge drink - ing (34.1 versus 16.8 percent, respectively) in the past 30 days. Despite being less likely to binge drink or drink heavily, women tend to face alcohol-related problems at a lower drink -ing level than men due to differences in body size and other biological factors. 5 Binge and heavy drinking among women var - ies significantly by age, as well as race and ethnic - ity. Younger women aged 18-25 years were more likely than women of other age groups to report binge and heavy drinking in the past month (33.3 versus 11.5 percent, respectively; data not shown). With respect to race and ethnicity, about 16 percent or more of women in every race and ethnic group reported binge drinking with the exception of non-Hispanic Asian women (7.9 percent). Heavy drinking was most commonly reported among non-Hispanic White women, non-Hispanic women of multiple races, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women (8.7, 7.6, and 6.8 percent, respectively). 816243240 Non-Hispanic Multiple RaceNon-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/ Other Pacific IslanderNon-Hispanic AsianNon-Hispanic American Indian/ Alaska Native Hispanic Non-Hispanic BlackNon-Hispanic WhiteBinge and Heavy Alcohol Use* in the Past Month Among Wo men Aged 18 and Older, by Race/Ethnicity, 2009-2010 Source II.3: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Se rvices Administration, National Su rvey on Dr ug Use and Health *Binge drinking indicates drinking four or more drinks on a single occasion for women and five or more drinks on a single occasion for men usually over the course of about 2 hours.

This contributes to numer - ous chronic illnesses, including several types of cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, reduced bone density and fertility, and premature death. 6 Due to its high prevalence and wide-ranging health con - sequences, smoking is the single largest cause of preventable death and disease for both men and women in the United States, accounting for an estimated 443,000 premature deaths annually. 7In 2009-2010, women aged 18 and older were less likely than men to report cigarette smoking in the past month (22.4 versus 27.5 percent, respectively). For both men and wom - en, smoking was more common among those with lower incomes. For example, 33.9 percent of women and 43.8 percent of men with house - hold incomes below 100 percent of poverty smoked in the past month, compared to 18.0 percent of women and 22.9 percent of men with incomes of 200 percent or more of pov - erty. Smoking also varied by race and ethnicity. Among women, smoking prevalence ranged from 6.8 percent among non-Hispanic Asians to 33.1 percent among non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives (data not shown). Quitting smoking has major and immedi -ate health benefits, including reducing the risk of diseases caused by smoking and improving overall health. 6 In 2009-2010, about 8 per- cent of women and men who had ever smoked daily and smoked in the previous 3 years had not smoked in the past year. The proportion of adults who quit smoking varied by poverty level for both women and men. For example, women with household incomes of 200 percent or more of poverty were almost twice as likely to have quit smoking as women with house - hold incomes below 100 percent of poverty (9.7 versus 5.6 percent, respectively). In 2011, six States covered comprehensive tobacco cessation benefits in their Medicaid programs and nine states required private insurance plans to cover tobacco cessation treatment. 8Percent of AdultsSmoking Cessation* in the Past Year Among Adults Aged 18 and Older, by Poverty Status** and Sex, 2009-2010 Source II.3: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Se rvices Administration, Na tional Su rvey on Dr ug Use and Health *Defined as the proportion of adults who did not smoke in the past year among those who ever smokeddaily at some point in their lives and smoked in the past 3 years; excludes adults who started smoking inthe past year. **Poverty level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $22,314 for a family of four in2010; adults aged 18-22 years living in college dormitories were excluded from poverty determinations.*Poverty level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $22,314 for a family of four in 2010; adults aged18-22 years living in college dormitories were excluded from poverty determinations.Cigarette Smoking in the Past Month Among Adults Aged 18 and Older, by Poverty Status* and Sex, 2009-2010 Source II.3: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Se rvices Ad ministration, Na tional Su rvey on Dr of than 100% of PovertyTotalFemale Male WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201223 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH BEHAVIORS ILLICIT DRUG USE Illicit drug use is associated with serious health and social consequences, including ad - diction and drug-induced death, impaired cognitive functioning, kidney and liver dam-age, infections-including HIV and Hepatitis-decreased productivity, and family disintegra - 9,10 Illicit drugs marijuana, cocaine, non-med - ical prescription-type such as pain relievers, stimulants, and sedatives. Methamphetamine is a type of psy-chotherapeutic drug that, in low doses, has lim-ited medical use for narcolepsy and attention deficit disorder, and is now manufactured and distributed illegally. 9 In 2009-2010, 6.5 percent of adult women aged 18 years and older reported using an il - licit drug within the past month, compared to 11.2 percent of adult men. Illicit drug use was highest among younger adults; 17.1 of women aged 18-25 reported past-month illicit drug use compared to 9.6 percent of women aged 26-34 and 5.6 percent of women aged 35-49. Rates of past-month illicit drug use also varied by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic Asian women were less likely than other women to report past-month use (2.1 percent, data not shown). Mari-juana was the most commonly used illicit drug among adult women (4.6 percent), followed by the non-medical use of psychotherapeutics (2.4 percent; data not shown). Past-month illicit drug use varied by poverty level. Among both men and women, illicit drug use was more common among those with lower incomes.

Health outcomes that have been associated with untreated STIs include cervical cancer, pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and even death in the case of HIV/AIDS (see pages on Sexually Transmitted Infec-tions and HIV/AIDS). 11,12 Women can lower their risk of contracting HIV and other STIs by avoiding sexual risk-taking behaviors. In 2006-2010, 3.9 percent of women aged 15-44 reported engaging in at least one sexual risk behavior during the past 12 months (data not shown). Among women aged 15-44, the most commonly reported sexual risk behaviors were having five or more male sex partners in the past 12 months (1.8 percent) and having had at least one male sex partner who had had sex with other males (1.4 percent). Less than 1 percent of women reported having had sex in exchange for money or drugs (0.7 percent), hav-ing had a sex partner that injects illicit drugs (0.8 percent), or having had an HIV-positive sex partner (0.1 percent; data not shown). The prevalence of engaging in sexual risk behaviors among women varied by sociodemo-graphic characteristics. Younger women, aged 15-24 years, were more likely to report engag-ing in at least one sexual risk behavior during the past 12 months (5.5 percent), compared to women aged 25-44 years (3.1 percent).

A baby girl born in the United States in 2010 could expect to live 81.0 years, 4.8 years longer than a male baby, whose life expectancy would be 76.2 years (data not shown). The differential between male and female life expectancy was greater among Blacks than Whites. Black males born in 2010 could expect to live 71.8 years, 6.2 years fewer than Black females (78.0 years). The difference be - tween White males and females was 4.8 years, with life expectancies at birth of 76.5 and 81.3 years, respectively. White females could expect to live 3.3 years longer than Black females. Life expectancy has increased since 1970 for males and females in both racial groups. Be - tween 1970 and 2010, White males' life expec-tancy increased from 68.0 to 76.5 years (12.5 percent), while White females' life expectancy increased from 75.6 to 81.3 years (7.5 percent). During the same period, the life expectancy for Black males increased from 60.0 to 71.8 years (19.7 percent), while life expectancy increased from 68.3 to 78.0 years (14.2 percent) for Black females. Between 1970 and 2010, the greater gains in life expectancy for males than females and for Blacks than Whites have led to reduced disparities by sex and race. Life expectancy among the Hispanic popula -tion has been reported only recently. In 2010, reported life expectancy by sex and race/ethnici - ty was highest for Hispanic females (83.8 years), followed by non-Hispanic White females (81.1 years), Hispanic males (78.5 years), non-His - panic Black females (77.7 years), non-Hispanic White males (76.4 years), and non-Hispanic Black males (71.4 years, data not shown). 13 Life expectancy data are not reported for Asian, Na - tive Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native populations due to known issues of under-reporting on death certificates.

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201226 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH In 2010, there were 1,219,545 deaths of women aged 18 and older in the United States. Of these deaths, nearly half were attributable to heart disease and malignant neoplasms (cancer), which were responsible for 23.8 and 22.4 per - cent of deaths, respectively. The next two lead - ing causes of death were cerebrovascular diseases (stroke), which accounted for 6.3 percent of deaths, and chronic lower respiratory diseases, which accounted for 6.0 percent. Heart disease was the leading cause of death for non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black women, while cancer was the leading cause among all other racial and ethnic groups. One of the most noticeable differences in lead - ing causes of death by race and ethnicity is that diabetes mellitus was a more prominent cause of death among minority women than non-Hispanic White women. Diabetes was the fourth leading cause of death among women of all racial and ethnic groups except non-His - panic White women, for whom it ranked as the eighth leading cause. Conversely, chronic lower respiratory disease was a more prominent cause of death among non-Hispanic White women, ranking third for non-Hispanic White women versus sixth or higher for other racial and ethnic groups. Nephritis, or kidney inflammation, was the fifth leading cause of death among non-His -panic Black women, but ranked eighth or ninth among women of other races and ethnicities. Hypertension was the tenth leading cause among non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander women, accounting for 2.1 and 2.0 percent of deaths, respectively. Also noteworthy is that non-Hispanic Ameri-can Indian/Alaska Native women experienced a higher proportion of deaths due to uninten-tional injury (7.5 percent; third leading cause of death) and liver disease (5.3 percent; fifth leading cause of death) than women of other racial and ethnic groups. Liver disease was also the tenth leading cause of death among Hispanic women, accounting for 2.1 percent of deaths (data not shown).

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201227 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE Health-related quality of life encompasses multiple aspects of health and is often measured in different ways, including self-reported health status and the number of days in the past month that a person felt that either their physical or mental health was not good. 14 In 2010, 54.2 percent of women reported be- ing in excellent or very good health, while 29.5 percent reported being in good health and 16.3 percent reported being in fair or poor health. Self-reported health status was similar among men and women but varied greatly by age, edu-cation, and race and ethnicity. About 60 percent of women aged 18-34 years reported excellent or very good health compared to 39.4 percent of women aged 65 and older (data not shown). Nearly 70 percent of women with a college de - gree reported excellent or very good health com - pared to less than one-quarter of women with - out a high school diploma. Conversely, fair or poor health was only reported by 7.5 percent of women with a college degree compared to 40.6 percent of women of who had not finished high school. With regard to race and ethnicity, fair or poor health was more likely to be reported among His - panic (29.5 percent), non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native (26.0 percent), non-His-panic Black (23.2 percent), and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander women (20.8 percent) compared to non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Asian women (12.9 and 12.7 percent, respectively; data not shown). In 2010, women reported more physically and mentally unhealthy days than men. Women reported an average of 3.9 days of poor physi - cal health, compared to 3.3 days per month for men. Similarly, women reported an average of 4.1 mentally unhealthy days, while men report-ed an average of 3.0 days per month (data for men not shown). While physically unhealthy days per month consistently increased with age, mentally unhealthy days decreased at age 65 and older. For example, on average, women aged 18-34 years reported only 2.5 physically unhealthy days per month but 4.4 mentally unhealthy days, whereas women aged 65 and older reported 5.7 physically unhealthy days per month but only 2.6 mentally unhealthy days.

One common definition is whether a per - son is able to perform physical tasks (e.g., walk - ing up 10 steps, standing for 2 hours, carrying a ten pound object), or engage in social activities and recreation (e.g., going shopping, visiting friends, sewing, reading) without the assistance of another person or using special equipment. 15 In 2008-2010, 33.6 percent of adults reported being limited in their ability to perform one or more of these common activities (data not shown). Women were more likely than men to report being limited in their activities (37.5 ver-sus 29.3 percent, respectively).The percentage of adults reporting activity limitations increased with age for both women and men. Among women, for example, only 19.1 percent of women aged 18-34 years re - ported activity limitations, compared to 27.7 percent of women aged 35-44 years, 45.8 per - cent of women aged 45-64 years, and 69.1 per - cent of women aged 65 years and older. The prevalence of activity limitations also varied with poverty level and educational attain - ment. For example, over half (50.2 percent) of women living in households with incomes less than 100 percent of poverty reported activity limitations compared to 29.8 percent of women living in households with incomes of 400 per -cent or more of poverty. Similarly, 47.1 percent of women with less than a high school educa-tion reported activity limitations compared to 28.5 percent of women with a college degree or higher (data not shown). In 2008-2010, the most commonly reported conditions among women with activity limita - tions were back or neck problems and arthritis (28.0 and 27.7 percent, respectively), followed by depression, anxiety, or emotional problems (11.1 percent), bone or joint injuries (9.7 per - cent), and weight problems (8.0 percent). Vi-sion and hearing problems were reported to cause limitations in 2.6 and 0.9 percent of women with activity limitations, respectively.

Arthritis comprises more than 100 different diseases that affect areas in or around the joints. 16 The most common type is osteoarthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease that causes pain and loss of movement due to deterioration in the cartilage covering the ends of bones in the joints. Types of arthritis that primarily affect women include lupus arthritis, fibromyalgia, and rheumatoid arthritis, which is the most serious and disabling type of arthritis. 17 In 2008-2010, 22.0 percent of adults in the United States reported that they had ever been diagnosed with arthritis; representing nearly 52 million adults (data not shown). Arthritis was more common among women than men (24.9 versus 18.8 percent, respectively). The propor - tion of adults with arthritis increases dramati-cally with age for both sexes. Only 5.3 percent of women aged 18-34 years had ever been diag - nosed with arthritis, compared to 15.6 percent of 35- to 44-year-olds, 34.2 percent of those aged 45-64 years, and 56.4 percent of women aged 65 years and older. Similarly, only 3.5 percent of men aged 18-34 years had ever been diagnosed with arthritis, compared to 44.1 percent of those aged 65 years and older. Among women, arthritis prevalence varied significantly by race and ethnicity. More than one-quarter of non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, and women of multiple races reported having been diagnosed with arthritis (26.9, 26.7, 26.2, and 31.4 percent, respectively), compared to 13.3 percent of non-Hispanic Asian women and 19.6 percent of Hispanic women (data not shown). Obesity has been associated with the onset and progression of osteoarthritis. 16 In 2008- 2010, nearly one-third of obese adults and one-fifth of overweight adults had been diagnosed with arthritis, compared to 17.4 percent of adults who were neither overweight nor obese. Among women, having been diagnosed with arthritis was reported by 33.6 percent of obese women, compared to 19.3 percent of women who were neither overweight nor obese.Percent of Adults with ArthritisAdults Aged 18 and Older with Arthritis,* by Sex and Weight Status,** 2008-2010 Source II.8: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Na tional Health Interview Survey *Reported a health professional has ever told them they have arthritis; estimates are age-adjusted. **BodyMass Index (BMI) is a ratio of weight to height.

In 2009-2010, more than two-thirds of adults were overweight or obese (68.3 percent); this includes 33.0 percent who were classified as overweight (BMI of 25.0-29.9) and 35.3 percent of adults who were classified as obese (BMI of 30.0 or more; data not shown). In 2009-2010, women were less likely than men to be overweight (28.1 versus 38.3 per-cent, respectively), but equally as likely to be obese (approximately 35 percent; data for men not shown). Weight status varied by age among both women and men, although the prevalence of obesity increased markedly for both sexes after age 25. Among women, obesity was most preva - lent among those aged 45-64 and 65 years and older (40.5 and 38.6 percent, respectively) com - pared to one-third of those aged 25-44 years and one-quarter of women aged 18-24 years. While overall, less than 2 percent of adults were under -weight (BMI of 18.5 or less; data not shown), 5.7 percent of women aged 18-24 years met this criteria in 2009-2010. Obesity also varies by poverty, as well as race and ethnicity. In 2009-2010, 43.6 percent of women living in households with incomes be - low the poverty level were obese, compared to 30.5 percent of women with a household in - come of 300 percent or more of poverty. Non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American women were also significantly more likely to be obese than non-Hispanic White women (58.0 and 44.0 versus 33.1 percent, respectively; data not shown). In contrast to non-Hispanic White women, non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American women have experienced significant increases in obesity over the last decade. 19 High- er obesity rates have also been reported among non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women while lower rates have been reported for non-Hispanic Asian women. 20 Community strategies that can help to prevent obesity in - clude efforts to improve access to healthy foods, parks, and recreational facilities. 21 Weight Status* Among Wo men Aged 18 and Olde r, by Age, 2009-2010 Source II.9: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth St atistics, Na tional He alth and Nutrition Examination Survey *Underweight is defined as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of less than 18.5; normal weight is defined as having a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9; overweight is defined as having a BMI between 25.0 and 29.9; obesity is defined as having a BMI of 30.0 or more.Underweight Normal and Older 45-64 Years 25-44 Years 18-24 Years Total WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201231 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS DIABETES Diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition char - acterized by high blood sugar and is among the leading causes of death in the United States.22 Complications of diabetes are serious and may include blindness, kidney damage, heart disease, stroke, nervous system disease, and amputation. The main types of diabetes are Type 1, Type 2, and gestational (diabetes occurring or first rec-ognized during pregnancy). Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults and has risk factors that include autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors. Type 2 dia - betes accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all diabetes cases, with risk factors that include obesity, physi-cal inactivity, a family history of the disease, and gestational diabetes.In 2007-2010, 28 million or 12.0 percent of adults were found to have diabetes (tested posi - tive for the condition on a fasting plasma glucose test, glycohemoglobin A1C test, or 2-hour oral glucose test; data not shown). Overall, diabetes was slightly more common in men than women (13.6 versus 10.6 percent, respectively) and was also higher for racial and ethnic minority groups than among non-Hispanic Whites. Among women, for example, non-Hispanic White women were least likely to have diabetes (8.9 percent) compared to non-Hispanic Black (16.5 percent), Mexican American (16.9 percent), and Other Hispanic women (12.8 percent). Diabe - tes prevalence increases greatly with age from 3.1 percent of women aged 18-44 years to 30.6 percent among women aged 75 years and older, and was also more common for women with less than a high school education compared to those who had graduated from college (15.6 versus 5.8 percent, respectively; data not shown). Diabetes can be successfully managed through diet modification, physical activity, glucose monitoring, and medication. 22 Diagno- sis is critical to develop a treatment plan and prevent serious complications. Among women who were found to have diabetes, only about half (49.4 percent) reported having been told by a health professional that they had diabetes. Non-Hispanic Black women were more likely than non-Hispanic White and Mexican Ameri-can women to have ever been told by a health professional that they have diabetes (70.6 versus 40.5 and 54.0 percent, respectively).

Female Male 15.621.4 16.9 USA 201232 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke, which are among the leading causes of death in the United States (see Heart Disease and Stroke ). It is defined as a systolic blood pressure (dur-ing heartbeats) of 140 mmHg or higher, a dia - stolic blood pressure (between heartbeats) of 90 mmHg or higher, or current use of blood pressure-lowering medication. In 2007-2010, 27.5 percent of women were identified as having high blood pressure. This includes 15.6 percent of women with con - trolled hypertension, who had a normal blood pressure measurement and reported using blood pressure-lowering medication, and 11.9 percent with uncontrolled hypertension, who had a high blood pressure measurement with or without the use of medication. In addition to medication, high blood pressure can also be controlled by losing excess body weight, partici-pating in regular physical activity, avoiding to-bacco smoke, and adopting a healthy diet with lower sodium and higher potassium intake. 23 The prevalence of hypertension does not vary by sex, but increases with age, affecting approxi - mately 3 out of 4 women aged 65 and older in 2007-2010 (74.4 percent; data not shown). Hy - pertension also varies by race and ethnicity. Over 40 percent of non-Hispanic Black women had hypertension compared to about 25 percent of non-Hispanic White, Mexican American, and Other Hispanic women. However, both non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American women were more likely to have uncontrolled hyperten - sion than non-Hispanic White women (19.5 and 15.8 versus 10.4 percent; respectively). Hypertension presents a unique public health challenge because many of those af-fected are unaware of their condition. 24 Among women with uncontrolled hypertension, 44.8 percent had not been previously diagnosed by a health care professional. About half of non-Hispanic White and Mexican American women with uncontrolled hypertension had not been diagnosed (52.5 and 47.9 percent, respectively), compared to only about one-third of non-His - panic Black women (32.2 percent).

Heart dis - ease and stroke are the most common forms of cardiovascular disease and are the first and third leading causes of death for both men and women in the United States. 25 Risk factors for both in - clude high blood pressure and cholesterol, excess weight, physical inactivity, age, and family his - tory. Stroke involves interrupted blood flow to the brain, whereas heart disease involves reduced blood flow to the heart, which can result in a heart attack. Chest pain is a common heart attack symptom; however, women are more likely than men to have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, and back or jaw pain. 26 Stroke symptoms can include numbness, headache, dizziness, confusion, trouble speaking, and blurred vision. 26 In 2008-2010, 11.8 percent of adults report- ed a diagnosis of heart disease (data not shown). Overall, men were slightly more likely to have been diagnosed with heart disease (12.8 versus 10.6 percent, respectively). Heart disease increas - es with age; among women, heart disease ranged from 4.7 percent of those aged 18-44 years to 32.2 percent of those aged 75 and older. As age increases, men are substantially more likely than women to have heart disease. Almost half (46.1 percent) of all men aged 75 and older have been diagnosed with heart disease. In 2008-2010, similar percentages of women and men reported that they had ever been diag - nosed with a stroke (2.6 and 2.7 percent, respec -tively). Among both women and men, the pro - portion of persons ever having had a stroke was generally higher among non-Hispanic Blacks. For example, 4.1 percent of non-Hispanic Black women had reported having a stroke compared to 2.5 percent of non-Hispanic White women and 2.6 percent of Hispanic women. Non-His-panic Asian women were least likely to report having had a stroke (1.1 percent). For reasons that are poorly understood, 42 percent of women will die within a year of having a heart attack compared to 24 percent of men. 27 There is evidence that women diagnosed with cardiovascular disease are less likely than men to receive certain treatments that have been report - ed to improve outcomes, and women may also be more likely to have other chronic conditions. 27 Stroke* Among Adults Aged 18 and Older, by Race/Ethnicity** and Sex, 2008-2010 Source II.8: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Na tional Health Interview Survey *Reported a health professional had ever told them that they had a stroke; estimates are age-adjusted.**The sample of American Indian/Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders was too small toproduce reliable results.*Reported a health professional had ever told them that they had coronary heart disease, angina pectoris,heart attack, or any other heart condition or disease; total estimates are age-adjusted.Heart Disease* Among Adults Aged 18 and Olde r, by Age and Sex, 2008-2010 Source II.8: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional Health Interview SurveyPercent of Adults Percent of Adults12.810.6 2.530.4 Total246810 Non-Hispanic Non-Hispanic BlackNon-Hispanic WhiteTotalMaleFemale WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201234 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS CANCER Cancer is the second leading cause of death for both men and women. It is estimated that 790,740 new cancer cases will be diagnosed among females and more than 275,000 females will die of cancer in 2012. 28 Based on prior years, lung and bronchus cancer is expected to be the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 72,590 deaths (26 percent of all cancer deaths), followed by breast cancer, which will be responsible for 39,510 (14 percent of deaths). Colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and ovarian cancer will also be major causes of cancer deaths among females, accounting for an addi - tional 59,260 deaths combined. Due to the varying survival rates for differ - ent types of cancer, the most common causes of death from cancer are not always the most com - mon types of cancer. For instance, although lung and bronchus cancer causes the greatest number of deaths, breast cancer is more commonly di - agnosed among females. In 2008, invasive breast cancer occurred among 121.9 per 100,000 fe - males, whereas lung and bronchus cancer oc - curred in only 54.5 per 100,000. Other types of cancer that are commonly diagnosed but are not among the top 10 causes of cancer death include thyroid, melanoma, and cervical cancer. Racial and ethnic disparities in cancer in - cidence may be explained by differences in be - havioral risk factors, such as smoking, heavy al - cohol consumption, obesity, poor nutrition, and physical inactivity that are largely a product of socioeconomic differences. 28 Racial and ethnic disparities in cancer death rates tend to be even greater than disparities in incidence rates because they are a function of differences in incidence, as well as stage at diagnosis, treatment, and patient survival, which are greatly influenced by health care access and quality.

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201235 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS Recommended screening can help detect several forms of cancer in early, more treatable stages, including breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer, and is shown to reduce mortality. 28 Vac- cines are also available to help prevent hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV) which can cause liver and cervical cancer, respectively. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 requires health in - surance plans to cover recommended preventive services, including cancer screenings and vaccina - tions, free-of-charge to beneficiaries. 29 In 2005-2009, cervical cancer incidence rates ranged from 5.8 per 100,000 American Indian/Alaska Native females to 11.8 per 100,000 His - panic females. For Black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander females, cervical cancer incidence increased with age, which may indicate a lack of early screening and treatment that can prevent invasive cancer from developing. The Pap test, a cervical cell examination, is recommended every 3 years for women aged 21-65 years to screen for precancerous lesions and cervical cancer. 30 Precancerous lesions and early, localized inva-sive cervical cancer are highly treatable; however, about half of invasive cervical cancer cases are not detected in the early, localized stage. 28 Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women but is also highly treatable when diag - nosed early; 99 percent of women will survive 5 years after a breast cancer diagnosis in the early, localized stage. Mammography screening is universally recommended every other year for women aged 50-74 years. 30 In 2005-2009, the proportion of breast cancer cases detected in the early, localized stage ranged from 54.5 percent among Black women to 65.2 percent among non-Hispanic White women. Disparities in early detection, as well as stage-specific survival, contribute to overall survival differences by race and ethnicity. In 2004-2008, more than 90 per - cent of non-Hispanic White and Asian/Pacific Islander women survived 5 years after breast cancer diagnosis, compared to about 80 percent of Black and American Indian/Alaska Native women (data not shown).

This disorder may be aggravated by allergens, environmental tobacco smoke and air pollution, poor housing conditions (mold, cockroaches, and dust mites), infections of the respiratory tract, and exercise. 31 However, by taking certain precautions, persons with asthma may be able to effectively manage this disorder and participate in daily activities. In 20082010, women were more likely to have asthma than men (9.7 versus 5.7 percent, respectively); this was true at all income levels and for all racial and ethnic groups. Among women, asthma prevalence decreased as income increased: 13.2 percent of women with household incomes below 100 percent of poverty reported having asthma, while 8.4 percent of women with incomes of 400 percent or more of poverty did so. Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native and non-Hispanic women of multiple races were most likely to have asthma (19.2 and 17.9 percent, respectively), while non-Hispanic Asian and Hispanic women were least likely to have asthma (5.6 and 7.6 percent, respectively; data not shown). A visit to the emergency room due to an asthma attack may indicate that asthma is not being effectively controlled or treated. In 20082010, 22.7 percent of women with an asthma attack in the past year sought emergency care for their condition. The proportion of women suffering an asthma attack who visited the emergency room varies with race and ethnicity, as well as household income. With regard to race and ethnicity, non-Hispanic Black and women of multiple races were most likely to have visited an emergency room (39.0 and 36.3 percent, respectively), while non-Hispanic White women were the least likely to have done so (17.4 percent). The likelihood of women with asthma visiting an emergency room decreases as household income increases: nearly one-third of women with household incomes below 100 percent of poverty visited an emergency room in the past year (32.8 percent), compared to 17.5 percent of those with incomes of 400 percent or more of poverty (data not shown).Percent of AdultsEmergency Room Visits Among Women Suffering an Asthma Attack* in the Past Year, by Race/Ethnicit y,** 2008-2010 Source II.8: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Na tional Health Interview Survey *Reported that (1) a health professional has ever told them that they have asthma, and (2) they had anasthma attack in the past year. **The sample of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, non-HispanicAmerican Indian/Alaska Native, and non-Hispanic Asians was too small to produce reliable results.*Reported that (1) a health professional has ever told them that they have asthma, and (2) they still haveasthma. **Poverty level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $22,314 for a family of four in 2010.Asthma* Among Adults Aged 18 and Older, by Poverty Status** and Sex, 2008-2010 Source II.8: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional Health Interview Survey 9.7 7.113.2 9.9 5.7 816243240 400% or More of Poverty200-399% of Poverty100-199% of PovertyLess Than 100% of PovertyTotal Percent of Wo men Suffering an Asthma Attack 17.432.0 22.739.0 36.3 6.48.4 5.84.99.4MaleFemale 816243240 WhiteTotal WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201237 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS INJURY Injury is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly among the young and the elderly. Injury includes unintentional acci-dents as well as intentional violence inflicted by the self or others. Injury prevention can include education, home hazard assessment and modi - fication, as well as laws and regulations, such as seat belt and gun laws, sobriety checkpoints, and prescription drug tracking systems. In 2010, there were 23.2 million non-fatal in - juries among adults aged 18 and over, resulting in emergency department visits, of which 11.2 million or 48 percent were to women (data not shown). At younger ages, men were more likely than women to visit the emergency department for a non-fatal injury. This pattern was reversed, however, for those aged 65 and older, among whom the rate of emergency department use for non-fatal injuries was 10,191.4 per 100,000 women and 7,717.2 per 100,000 men. More than 90 percent of non-fatal injuries treated in an emergency department were unintentional (data not shown). Although falls are the leading cause of non-fatal injury in every adult age group, they are more prominent at older ages. 32 Being struck by or against an object, motor vehicle crashes, and overexertion are more prominent mecha-nisms of non-fatal injury at younger ages. Injuries are the leading cause of death among both men and women aged 18-34. In 2010, men were twice as likely to die of injury as women (102.2 versus 45.9 per 100,000 popu - lation; data not shown). Fatal injury rates also vary greatly by race and ethnicity. Among wom-en, injury death rates from all causes were high - est for non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women and lowest for Hispanic and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander women (71.7, 20.7, and 17.5 deaths per 100,000, re-spectively). Poisoning recently surpassed motor vehicle traffic as the leading mechanism of fatal injury, with the majority caused by drugs. 33 With regard to violent deaths, suicide was more common than homicide among women of most racial and ethnic groups, with the ex-ception of non-Hispanic Black women. Non-Hispanic Black women had the highest rate of homicide and lowest rate of suicide among all racial and ethnic groups (6.0 and 2.3 deaths per 100,000, respectively).Rate Per 100,000 WomenFatal Injury Among Women Aged 18 and Older, by Intent of Injury and Race/Ethnicity, 2010 Source II.6: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Na tional Vital Statistics System *Includes listed categories in addition to undetermined intent and injury from legal intervention(e.g., police pursuit). *Non-fatal injuries resulting in an emergency department visit.Non-Fatal Injury* Among Adults Aged 18 and Older, By Age and Sex, 2010 Source II.6: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention & Control, National Electronic Injury Surveillance System - All In jury ProgramRate Per 100,000 Adults3,0006,0009,00012,00015,000 65 Years and Older 50-64 Years 35-49 Years 18-34 Total1632486480 4.41.3Total* Unintentional Suicide Homicide WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201238 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS MENTAL ILLNESS Overall, mental illness affects both women and men equally and about half of all Americans will meet the criteria for a diagnosable mental disorder over the course of their lives. 34 However, types of mental disorders vary with sex. Women are more likely than men to experience an anxiety or mood disorder, such as depression, while men are more likely to experience an impulse-control or substance use disorder. A major depressive episode (MDE) is defined according to the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as a period of 2 weeks or longer during which there is either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure and at least four other symptoms that reflect a change in functioning, such as problems with sleep, eating, energy, concentration, and self-image. In 2009-2010, an estimated 9.8 million women aged 18 years and older, comprising 8.4 percent of that population, reported experiencing an MDE in the past year, compared to 5.5 million or 5.0 percent of men. Among both men and women, MDE was reported more frequently among those with lower incomes. For example, 11.8 percent of women and 7.2 percent of men with household incomes below 100 percent of poverty experienced past-year MDE, compared to 7.3 percent of women and 4.5 percent of men with incomes of 200 percent or more of poverty. Although women were more likely than men to experience a past-year MDE, men were twice as likely as women to experience a past-year substance use disorder (12.6 versus 5.8 percent, respectively). Substance use disorder, as defined by the DSM-IV, encompasses both abuse and dependence on alcohol or illicit drugs; abuse relates to social problems with work, family, or the law due to substance use and dependence relates to health and emotional problems, such as tolerance or withdrawal. Women who experienced a past-year MDE were nearly four times as likely to report a substance use disorder than those who did not (17.5 versus 4.8 percent, respectively), while men who experienced a past-year MDE were 2.5 times as likely as their non-affected counterparts to report a substance use disorder (29.4 percent versus 11.7 percent, respectively).Percent of AdultsPast Year Substance Use Disorder,* by Sex and Past Year Major Depressive Episode,** 2009-2010 Source II.3: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Se rvices Administration, National Su rvey on Dr ug Use and Health *Substance use disorder is abuse or dependence on alcohol or illicit drugs; abuse relates to social problemsdue to substance use, such as problems with work, family, or the law; dependence relates to health andemotional problems, such as tolerance or withdrawal. **A past year major depressive episode is definedas a period of 2 weeks or longer during which there is either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasureand at least four other symptoms that reflect a change in functioning, such as problems with sleep, eating,energy, concentration, and self-image. *A past year major depressive episode is defined as a period of 2 weeks or longer during which there iseither depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure and at least four other symptoms that reflect achange in functioning, such as problems with sleep, eating, energy, concentration, and self-image.**Poverty level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $22,314 for a family of four in 2010; adultsaged 18-22 years living in college dormitories were excluded from poverty determinations.Past Year Major Depressive Episode* Among Adults Aged 18 and Older, by Poverty Status** and Sex, 2009-2010 Source II.3: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Se rvices Ad ministration, Na tional Su rvey on Dr ug 2.37.5 5.817.5 12.6 612182430 Male Female 4.829.4 11.7Major Depressive of 5.97.29.2 100% of PovertyTotalFemale Male WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201239 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES Adverse childhood experiences include verbal, physical, and sexual abuse, as well as forms of family dysfunction such as having a substance-abusing household member or wit-nessing domestic violence. 35 Exposure to these types of traumatic experiences early in life has been associated with many mental and physi - cal health problems throughout the lifespan, including substance abuse, depression, cardio - vascular disease, and premature death. 36,37 In 2009-2010 among a 7-State report- ing area, more than one-in-four women (26.0 percent) reported that they had been verbally abused as a child on more than one occasion\u2014defined as being sworn at, insulted or put down by a parent or adult in the home\u2014and about 15 percent reported that they had ever been physically or sexually abused as a child (15.4 and 15.7 percent, respectively). Types of child-hood family dysfunction among women ranged from 6.1 percent who reported that a household member had gone to prison to more than a quarter who had a substance-abusing household member (29.1 percent) or whose parents sepa-rated or divorced (25.2 percent). Compared to men, women were more than twice as likely to have experienced sexual abuse (15.7 versus 6.5 percent, respectively) and were also more likely to report having had a mentally ill or substance-abusing household member. The likelihood of negative health outcomes later in life increases with the number of adverse childhood experiences. 37 Among the 7-State reporting area in 2009-2010, 9.6 percent of women reported having five or more adverse experiences in childhood. Women with less than a high school education were most likely to have reported five or more adverse childhood experiences (17.0 percent) while college-educated women were least likely to have endured five or more adverse childhood experiences (6.5 percent).

IPV can occur among heterosexual or same-sex couples and does not require sexual intimacy. 38,39 In 2010, 35.6 percent of adult women aged 18 years and older, or 42.4 mil - lion women, reported having experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime while nearly 6 percent reported at least one of these experiences in the past 12 months. Of these forms of IPV, lifetime experience of physical violence was most commonly reported by women (32.9 percent), followed by stalking (10.7 percent), and rape (9.4 percent). While rape and stalking were less commonly reported among men, 28.5 percent of adult men reported having experienced any IPV in their lifetime. Psychological aggression is a common form of IPV experienced by nearly half of all women and men during their lifetime. Women who ex - perienced psychological aggression reported be - ing called names (64.3 percent), insulted or hu-miliated (58.0 percent), witnessing anger by their intimate partner that seemed dangerous (57.9 percent), and facing demands to know where she was and what she was doing (61.7 percent). In addition, 8.6 percent of women reported that an intimate partner tried to get them pregnant when they did not want to or refused to use a condom (data not shown). IPV has been associated with a range of both short- and long-term health and social conse - quences. 40 Among women who have experienced IPV, 80.8 percent reported at least one IPV-re-lated impact, such as injury, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or missing work or school.

More than three-quarters of female victims of rape were first raped before the age of 25 years (data not shown). Less than 1.5 percent of men reported having been raped in their lifetime (data not shown).Lifetime experience of sexual victimization other than rape was reported by 53 million or 44.6 percent of women in 2010. This includes non-contact unwanted sexual experiences, such as someone harassing or exposing themselves without physical contact, which was reported by 33.7 percent of women, and unwanted sexual contact, such as unwanted fondling, reported by 27.2 percent of women. Sexual coercion, de - fined as unwanted sexual penetration that occurs after non-physical pressure such as repeated de - mands for sex, was also reported by 13.0 percent of women. Nearly one-quarter of men reported having experienced sexual victimization other than rape in their lifetime (data not shown).The prevalence of rape and other forms of sexual violence reported by women vary by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic women of multiple races and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women were most likely to report having experienced rape at some point in their lifetime (33.5 and 26.9 percent, respectively), while His - panic and non-Hispanic White women were least likely (14.6 and 18.8 percent, respectively).

Yet there are approximately 19 million new STI cases in the United States each year at an annual health care cost of nearly 17 billion dollars. 41 Active infections can increase the likelihood of contracting another STI, such as HIV, and untreated STIs can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Safer sex practices, screening, and treatment can help reduce the burden of STIs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requires State and local reporting of new chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV cases (see page on HIV/AIDS). Reported STI rates among females vary by age and race and ethnicity. Rates are highest among adolescents and young adults; over 70 percent of all chlamydia and gonorrhea cases in females occurred among those under 25 years of age in 2010 (data not shown). With the exception of Asian/Pacific Islanders, minority females had higher STI rates than non-Hispanic White females. For example, compared with non-Hispanic White females, the chlamydia rate was 7.8 times higher for non-Hispanic Black females, 4.6 times higher for American Indian/Alaska Native females, and 3.1 times higher for Hispanic females. The syphilis rate was also highest among non-Hispanic Black females (7.5 versus 0.3 per 100,000 non-Hispanic White females; data not shown).Although chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis can be cured with appropriate antibiotics, viral STIs, such as HIV, human papillomavirus (HPV), and herpes cannot be cured but can be monitored and managed to prevent symptoms and disease progression. 12 Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2) is an infection that causes genital herpes and can lead to blindness, neonatal infections, and increased risk for HIV. Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) can also cause genital herpes, but it is more commonly associated with sores around the mouth, and recurring symptoms are less common than with HSV-2. 42 Overall, 59.2 percent of women aged 18-49 years tested positive for HSV-1 and 22.0 percent tested positive for HSV-2 in 2009-2010. The prevalence of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 increased with age.Percent of Wo menHSV-1 and HSV-2 Infection Among Women, by Age, 2009-2010 Source II.9: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Na tional Health and Nu trition Examination Survey *May include Hispanics.Rates of Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Among Females (All Ages), by Race/Ethnicity, 2010 Source II.16: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Sexually Transmitted Di sease Surveillance HEALTH USA 201243 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS HIV/AIDS Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the final stage of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which destroys or disables the cells that are responsible for fighting infection. AIDS is diagnosed when HIV has weakened the immune system enough that the body has difficulty fighting infections. 43 HIV is predominantly transmitted through sexual contact and injection drug use. While HIV and AIDS disproportionately affect men who have sex with men, a notable proportion of HIV/AIDS diagnoses occur among women and particularly minority women. In 2010, adoles - cent and adult females accounted for 21.3 per - cent of new HIV diagnoses at ages 13 and older, with a rate of 8.0 cases per 100,000 females. The rate of new diagnoses among males was 31.4 per 100,000 (data not shown). 44 Rates of new HIV cases among adolescent and adult females vary dramatically by race and ethnicity. HIV disproportionately affects non-Hispanic Black females at a rate that is nearly twenty times higher than among non-Hispan - ic White females (41.7 versus 2.1 cases per 100,000 females, respectively). Non-Hispanic Black females accounted for two-thirds of all new HIV diagnoses among females. 44 New HIV diagnoses are also elevated among Hispanic, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native, and non-Hispanic females of multiple races (9.2, 6.4, and 9.7 cases per 100,000 females, respectively).Early detection of HIV infection is critical in preventing transmission of the virus to oth - ers, and persons aware of their HIV infection can benefit from advances in medicine that may significantly prolong their lives. Early entry to care can also produce significant cost savings for medical treatment. 45 Despite these indi - vidual and societal benefits, a sizeable propor - tion of people identified as HIV-positive receive an AIDS diagnosis simultaneously or within a year of HIV diagnosis. In 2009, 30.3 percent of HIV-positive females received an AIDS diag - nosis within 12 months of their HIV diagnosis, which was slightly less than for males (33.1 per-cent, all ages included).

Risk of osteoporosis increases with age and is much more common among women than men. In 2007-2010, an estimated 10 million women (9.0 percent) and 1.3 million men (1.3 percent) had osteoporosis. More than one in four women aged 65 and older had been diagnosed with osteoporosis, compared with 4.3 percent of men. Osteoporosis also varied significantly by race and ethnicity. About 30 percent of non-Hispanic White and Hispanic women aged 65 and older reported that they had been diagnosed with osteoporosis, compared to 12.9 percent of non-Hispanic Black women of the same age (data not shown). Osteoporosis may be prevented and treated by getting the recommended amounts of calcium and vitamin D, by engaging in regular weight-bearing physical activity (such as walking), and by taking prescription medication when appropriate. 46,47 To promote early diagnosis and the prevention of complications, bone density tests are recommended for all women aged 65 and older and younger women who have a risk factor, including low weight, parental history of hip fracture, smoking, and daily alcohol use. 48 Bone fractures among the elderly most commonly occur among those with osteoporosis and can have devastating consequences. For example, 1 in every 5 hip fracture patients die within a year of their injury. 47 Falls are a common direct cause of osteoporosis-related fracture and are the leading cause of injury\u2014both fatal and nonfatal\u2014among adults aged 65 and older. In 2010, there were 2.4 million unintentional nonfatal fall injuries treated in emergency departments among adults aged 65 and older (data not shown). The rate of nonfatal fall injury was higher among women than men and increased with age. Among both women and men, the rate of nonfatal fall injury was about five times higher among those aged 85 and older than those aged 65-69. Fall prevention efforts can include muscle strengthening, home hazard assessments and modifications, and avoiding sedative medications that may impair balance and coordination. 47Percent of AdultsDiagnosed Osteoporosis* Among Adults Aged 18 and Older, By Age and Sex, 2007-2010 Source II.10: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Na tional Health and Nu trition Examination SurveyNonfatal Unintentional Injury Due to Falls* per 100,000 Adults Aged 65 and Older, by Age and Sex, 2010 Source II.6: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, All In jury Program 1.2 1.3 1.20.39.4 4.327.4 9.0Female Male 612182430 65 Years and Older 45-64 Years 18-44 Years Total *Reported a health professional had ever told them they had osteoporosis. *Treated in hospital emergency departments.

Although the risk for Alzheimer's disease increases with age, it is not a normal part of aging. Risk factors include a family history, head trauma or traumatic brain injury, and cardiovascular disease risk factors such as high cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and physical inactivity. In 2012, 5.2 million or 13 percent of U.S. adults aged 65 and older are estimated to have Al - zheimer's disease and another 200,000 below age 65 are thought to have early-onset Alzheimer's. Due to the aging of the population, the number of adults aged 65 and older with Alzheimer's dis - ease is expected to triple by 2050. 49 Women con- stitute 3.4 million or nearly two-thirds of adults aged 65 and older with Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's disease is the fifth leading cause of death among men and women aged 65 and old-er. 1 Severe dementia causes complications, such as immobility and swallowing disorders, that can lead to death. In 2010, 205.2 per 100,000 or nearly 83,000 adults aged 65 and older, about 70 percent of whom were women, died of Alzheim - er's. The risk of death due to Alzheimer's increases greatly with age, ranging from 19.8 deaths per 100,000 for those aged 65-74 years to 987.1 deaths per 100,000 for those aged 85 and older. Overall, women are about 75 percent more likely than men to die of Alzheimer's disease (257.6 versus 144.0 deaths per 100,000 adults aged 65 and older). The greater rates of Alzheimer's prev - alence and mortality among women are related to their longer life expectancy rather than an in - creased sex-specific risk of disease. 49 Not only are women more likely than men to have Alzheimer's, they are also more likely to be caregivers for someone with Alzheimer's\u2014exact - ing a substantial toll of emotional and physical stress. Of the nearly 15 million Americans who provide unpaid care for a person with Alzheim-er's or another dementia, about 70 percent are women. 49 Given the large and increasing burden of Alzheimer's disease, advances in prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment are greatly needed. In 2011, a new diagnostic category of \"preclini - cal Alzheimer's disease\" was developed to aid re - search for early detection and treatment prior to the onset of symptoms. 49 Adults Aged 65 and Older with Alzheimer 's Disease,* By Sex, 2012 Source II.18: Alzheimer 's Association, Alzheimer 's Disease Fa cts and Fi guresDeaths Due to Alzheimer 's Disease* per 100,000 Adults Aged 65 and Older, By Age and Sex, 2010 Source II.19: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional Vital Statistics System Female 3.4 million *Estimates are based on the Chicago Health and Aging Project incidence rates converted to prevalence estimates and applied to population projections; assumes the same proportion female as in 2010. *Deaths with Alzheimer 's disease listed as underlying cause.Deaths Per 100,000 Adults205.2251.6 144.0184.5 198.2165.5987.11,084.8 784.9 19.8 20.7 18.6Male million Years and Older 75-84 Years 65-74 Years TotalTotalFemale Male WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201246 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS SLEEP HEALTH Just like good nutrition and physical activ - ity, adequate sleep is vital to healthy function - ing and well-being. Inadequate sleep increases the likelihood of occupational errors and motor vehicle accidents and is also linked to various chronic conditions including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and depression. 50 In ad- dition to competing demands and insufficient time for sleep, conditions such as insomnia and sleep apnea (sleep-disordered breathing) can also contribute to poor sleep quality. 51 The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults get 7-9 hours of sleep per day.52 In 2008-2010, about 70 percent of women and men reported getting an adequate amount of sleep, defined as 8 or more hours for persons aged 18-21 years of age and 7 or more hours for those aged 22 years or older. Among both women and men, the probability of getting adequate sleep generally increased with age for both women and men and was highest among those aged 65 years and older (75.6 and 80.1 percent, respectively). By contrast, only about 63 percent of young adults aged 18-24 years reported getting an adequate amount of sleep. Among women, single mothers were least likely to report getting adequate hours of sleep (60.1 percent), followed by single women with-out children (67.1 percent). Women who were married or cohabitating without children and those in two-parent families were more likely to get a sufficient amount of sleep (76.1 and 72.1 percent, respectively). Adequate sleep also varied by poverty status and race and ethnicity. Fewer than two-thirds (64.4 percent) of women living in households with incomes below the poverty level had suf - ficient hours of sleep, compared to nearly three-quarters of women living in households with in - comes of 400 percent or more of poverty (73.4 percent; data not shown). With respect to race and ethnicity, non-Hispanic Black women were less likely than women of other racial and eth - nic groups to get adequate hours of sleep (62.8 percent compared to about 70 percent of other women; data not shown).

Key indicators of preconception health include not smoking or drinking prior to pregnancy, taking a daily multivitamin, and achieving a healthy weight prior to pregnancy. 54 Frequent drinking, especially early in preg- nancy, can cause fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol-related birth defects. 54,55 Smoking also increases the risk of pregnancy complications, preterm birth, and low birth weight. 53 In 2007- 2009, about 1 in 5 recent mothers in a 32-State area reported binge drinking (consumed 5 or more drinks in a sitting ) at least once within 3 months prior to pregnancy (21.1 percent) and 23.6 percent reported smoking. Binge drinking and smoking in the 3 months prior to pregnancy tend to be higher among younger mothers. For example, among 20- to 24-year-old women, 25.5 percent reported preconception binge drinking and 34.2 percent reported preconception smok-ing compared to 15.3 and 12.4 percent, respec - tively, among women aged 40 years and older. Daily use of multivitamins containing folic acid can reduce the risk of neural tube defects in infants by two-thirds. 53 In 2007-2009, only 29.8 percent of recent mothers reported daily multivitamin use in the month prior to preg - nancy. Daily preconception multivitamin use increased with maternal age. Over 40 percent of women aged 30 years and older reported tak - ing a daily multivitamin in the month prior to pregnancy compared with less than 20 percent of women younger than 25 years of age. Women should also attain a healthy weight prior to pregnancy to prevent complications, such as diabetes and hypertension, which may necessitate preterm delivery. 53 Only about half of new mothers (51.1 percent) reported a healthy or normal pre-pregnancy weight for their height. This proportion did not vary by maternal age with the exception of teenage mothers who were more likely to have had a normal pre-pregnancy weight (58.6 percent). With regard to race and ethnicity, non-Hispanic Asian mothers were most likely to have attained a healthy pre-pregnancy weight (66.4 percent), while non-Hispanic Black mothers were least likely (40.4 percent; data not shown).

Unin - tended pregnancies that lead to births are asso - ciated with both short and long-term negative outcomes for both mother and child, including delayed prenatal care, maternal depression, in-creased risk for intimate partner violence, and poor developmental and educational outcomes for children. 56 Historically, it has been difficult to estimate the rate of unintended pregnancy due to reporting issues specifically related to the underreporting of pregnancies ending in abor - tion. However, in 2006-2010 women reported that 37.1 percent of live births occurring in the past 5 years were unintended at the time of con - ception. This includes 13.8 percent of pregnan-cies that were unwanted and 23.3 that were mis - timed. Of births that were mistimed at the time of conception, 14.0 percent were reported by the mother to have occurred 2 or more years too soon (data not shown). Overall, the proportion of births that were unintended has not changed significantly since 1982. 57 Unintended pregnancy varies by a variety of factors including age, as well as race and eth - nicity. In 2006-2010, over three-quarters (77.2 percent) of births in the past 5 years to mothers aged 15-19 years were unintended at the time of conception. The same was true for half (50.1 percent) of births to women aged 20-24 years and one-quarter (25.4 percent) among those aged 25-44 (data not shown). Births to non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women were more likely than those to non-Hispanic White wom - en to have been unintended (53.5 and 42.9 versus 30.7 percent, respectively). Of births to non-Hispanic Black women that were mis - timed, 21.8 percent were 2 or more years too soon, which is two times higher than for births to non-Hispanic White women (10.8 percent; data not shown). Unintended pregnancies can be averted with proper use of effective contraceptives. In 2006-2010, 4.7 million or 11.0 percent of women at risk of unintended pregnancy\u2014who were hav - ing intercourse and not sterile, pregnant, or try - ing to get pregnant\u2014reported that they were not using contraception. Younger women were more likely to not be using contraception while at risk for unintended pregnancy.

Smoking in the last 3 months of pregnancy var - ied significantly by race and ethnicity. About one-quarter of non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native mothers (26.0 percent) reported having smoked in the last 3 months of pregnan - cy, while less than 5 percent of non-Hispanic Asian and Hispanic mothers reported doing so (2.3 and 3.8 percent, respectively). Smoking in the last 3 months of pregnancy also varied by maternal education, ranging from 2.3 percent among mothers with at least 16 years of educa - tion to about 20 percent among mothers with 12 or fewer years of education (data not shown). Due to awareness of the neonatal health con - sequences of smoking, pregnancy may be a time of heightened motivation to quit. In 2007-2009, 47.3 percent of mothers in a 32-State area who reported smoking in the 3 months prior to preg - nancy had not smoked in the last 3 months of pregnancy. Prenatal smoking cessation rates in - creased with maternal education, ranging from 32.2 percent among mothers with less than 12 years of education to 74.5 percent among moth - ers with 16 or more years of education. Hispanic and non-Hispanic Asian mothers had the highest rates of smoking cessation at about 67 percent, while fewer than half of mothers of other racial and ethnic groups had quit smoking during preg - nancy (data not shown). In addition to clinical screening and counseling, 58 increases in State tobacco taxes and smoke-free laws have been shown to improve prenatal smoking cessation. 59Percent of Mothers Percent of MothersCigarette Smoking in the Last 3 Months of Pregnancy, by Race/Ethnicity, 2007-2009* Source II.20: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring SystemSmoking Cessation During Pregnancy,* by Maternal Education, 2007-2009** Source II.20: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System 12.515.826.0 18.6 13.410.7 2.3 3.81020304050607080 Non-Hispanic Multiple RaceNon-Hispanic Native NativeHispanic Non-Hispanic BlackNon-Hispanic WhiteTotal *Includes data from a total of 32 States and New York City; 25 States contributed all 3 years; mothers completed surveys between 2 and 9 months postpartum.*Defined as the proportion of mothers who reported not smoking in the last 3 months of pregnancy among those who reported smoking in the three months prior to pregnancy.**Includes data from a total of 32 States and New York City; 25 States contributed all 3 years; mothers completed surveys between 2 and 9 months postpartum.47.343.6 32.274.5 54.0 1020304050607080 16 Years or More13-15 Years12 Years Less than 12 YearsTotal WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201250 HEALTH STATUS - REPRODUCTIVE AND MATERNAL HEALTH LIVE BIRTHS AND DELIVERY TYPE In 2010, there were 4 million live births in the United States and the birth rate among women aged 15-44 years was 64.1 births per 1,000, a decrease of 3 percent from 2009 and the lowest rate reported in over a decade. 60 Overall birth rates were highest among mothers aged 25-29 years (108.3 live births per 1,000 women), followed by those aged 30-34 years (96.5 births per 1,000 women). Between 2009 and 2010, the birth rate declined or remained unchanged in every age group except for 40-44 years, which increased 2 percent to the high-est level since 1967. 60,61 The birth rates among teens aged 15-19 years and young women aged 20-24 years declined to the lowest levels ever re - ported (34.2 and 90.0 per 1,000, respectively). Only birth rates among women aged 30 years and older are higher now than in 1990. The average age at first birth increased to 25.4 in 2010, an increase of 4 years since 1970. 61,62 Asian/Pacific Islander women had the highest average age at first birth while American Indian/Alaska Native women had the lowest (29.1 and 22.3 years, respectively; data not shown). 60 The proportion of births delivered by cesar - ean section declined slightly from 32.9 percent in 2009 to 32.8 percent in 2010. This represents the first decline in cesarean delivery since 1996, when 20.7 percent of births were delivered by cesarean section. The U.S. cesarean delivery rate far exceeds the upper limit of 15 percent recom - mended by the World Health Organization. 63 Healthy People 2020 has set national objectives to reduce the cesarean delivery rate by 10 per - cent among low-risk women giving birth for the first time and among low-risk women with a prior cesarean section. 54 In 2010, 27.3 percent of low-risk women giving birth for the first time and 89.9 percent of low-risk women with a pri - or cesarean section delivered by cesarean (data not shown). 64 Births by Cesarean Delivery, 1990-2010 Source II.23: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health St atistics, Na tional Vital Statistics SystemLive Births per 1,000 Women, by Age, 1990-2010 Source II.23: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health St atistics, Na tional Vital Statistics System Percent of Live Births32.8 Cesarean Delivery 510152025303540 2010 2005 2000 1995 1990110 5100150 1990 1995 2000 Women (log scale)34.2 10.245.964.190.096.5108.3 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201251 HEALTH STATUS - REPRODUCTIVE AND MATERNAL HEALTH MATERNAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY Diabetes and hypertension are the most commonly reported health conditions among pregnant women. Diabetes, both chronic and gestational (developing only during pregnancy), may pose health risks to a woman and her baby. Women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk for developing diabetes later in life. 65 In 2010, among the 33 States that collected this in - formation on the revised birth certificate, chronic or pre-existing diabetes occurred at a rate of 7.0 per 1,000 live births while gestational diabetes was a complication in 44.2 per 1,000 live births. Both chronic and gestational diabetes increase significantly with maternal age to a peak among mothers aged 40 years and older of 16.7 and 97.0 per 1,000 live births, respectively. Hypertension during pregnancy can also be either chronic in nature or gestational. Severe hypertension during pregnancy can result in preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and early delivery. 66 In 2010, in the 33 States that used the revised birth certificate, chronic and pregnancy-associated hypertension were present in 12.7 and 43.4 per 1,000 live births, respectively. Chronic and pregnancy-associated hypertension were highest among mothers aged 40 or older (34.7 and 57.6 per 1,000, respectively). These condi - tions also varied by race and ethnicity (data not shown, see Women's Health USA 2011). In 2006-2007, there were 1,294 deaths found to be pregnancy-related (15.1 per 100,000 live births), which are defined as deaths related to or aggravated by pregnancy and occurring dur - ing or within one year after the end of the preg-nancy. 67 This definition includes more deaths than the traditional definition of maternal mor - tality, which counts pregnancy-related deaths only up to 42 days after the end of pregnancy. Cardiovascular disease was the leading cause of pregnancy-related mortality (13.5 percent) and other chronic conditions including heart muscle diseases (12.6 percent) and non-cardiovascular diseases (11.8 percent) also contributed substan - tially. The maternal mortality ratio among Black women was roughly 3 times the rate among White women (34.8 versus 11.0 per 100,000 live births - see Child Health USA 2012).

Hormonal changes and lack of sleep can contribute to \"baby blues\" or mild depressive symptoms, such as occasional sadness, crying, irritability, and trouble concen-trating, which are common and transient. 68 Depression occurs when these symptoms, in-cluding depressed mood and loss of interest in activities, are severe and last for more than two weeks. 69 Other symptoms can include changes in appetite, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and suicidal thoughts. In 2009, 11.9 percent of recent mothers in a 29-State area reported postpartum depres-sive symptoms since the birth of their child in the previous 2-9 months. Postpartum depres - sive symptoms varied significantly by race and ethnicity. The proportion of mothers reporting postpartum depressive symptoms was highest among non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives, non-Hispanic mothers of multiple races, and non-Hispanic Black mothers (15.4, 14.4, and 13.8 percent, respectively), and was lowest among non-Hispanic Asian mothers (7.9 percent). Postpartum depressive symptoms also varied greatly by level of maternal education, from 6.9 percent among mothers with at least 16 years of education to 22.2 percent among mothers with less than 12 years of education (data not shown). Factors that may increase the risk of postpartum depression include previous depressive episodes, stressful life events, and limited social support. 68,69 Early diagnosis and treatment are important as postpartum depression can interfere with maternal-infant bonding and child develop - ment. 69 Screening for depression is encouraged by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both during and after pregnancy. In 2007-2009, 76.6 percent of recent mothers in a 10-State area reported that a health care provider talked with them about \"baby blues\" or postpartum depression during or after their most recent pregnancy; this ranged from 73.0 percent of mothers with less than 12 years of education to 79.2 percent of mothers with 16 or more years of education (see Women's Health USA 2011 for estimates by race and ethnicity).Percent of Mothers Percent of MothersPostpartum Depressive Symptoms* Among Mothers with a Recent Live Birth, by Race/Ethnicity , 2009** Source II.26: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring SystemWomen with a Recent Live Birth Who Reported That a Health Care Provider Discussed Postpartum Depression, by Maternal Education,* 2007-2009** Source II.20: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System 11.913.8 10.912.015.414.476.675.577.8 79.2 73.0 7.911.0 *Defined as a sum of 10 or higher in response to 3 questions of how often the mom reported feeling down, depressed, or sad; hopeless; or slowed down since the birth of , where 1=never, 2=rarely, 3=sometimes, 4=often, 5=always. **Includes data from a total of 29 States; mothers completed surveys between 2 and 9 months postpartum.**Includes data from a total of 10 States and New York City; 4 States contributed all 3 years; mothers completed surveys between 2 and 9 months postpartum.5101520 Non-Hispanic Multiple RaceNon- Hispanic Native Hawaiian/ Other Pacific AsianNon-Hispanic American Alaska NativeHispanic Non-Hispanic BlackNon-Hispanic WhiteTotal1836547290 16 Years or More13-15 Years 12 Years Less than 12 YearsTotal WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201253 HEALTH STATUS - REPRODUCTIVE AND MATERNAL HEALTH BREASTFEEDING Breast milk benefits the health, growth, im - munity, and development of infants, and moth - ers who breastfeed may have a reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes and breast and ovarian cancer.70 Among infants born in 2008, 74.6 percent were reported to have ever been breastfed, represent - ing a significant increase over the 70.9 percent of infants ever breastfed in 2000. 71 The Ameri - can Academy of Pediatrics recommends that in-fants be exclusively breastfed\u2014 without supple-mental solids or liquids\u2014for the first 6 months of life; however, only 44.3 percent of infants born in 2008 were breastfed at 6 months of age and only 14.8 percent were exclusively breastfed through the first 6 months. Breastfeeding practices vary considerably by a number of factors, including maternal race and ethnicity, education, age, and income. With respect to education, infants born to mothers with a college education were most likely to have ever been breastfed (88.1 per - cent), while infants born to mothers with a high school degree or less were least likely (64.3 and 66.1 percent, respectively). With respect to race and ethnicity, Asian infants were most likely to ever be breastfed (86.7 percent) while non-Hispanic Black infants were the least likely to ever be breastfed (59.0 percent). Infants born to older mothers and those with higher household incomes were also more likely to be breastfed (data not shown). These sociodemographic pat-terns generally persist with regard to the dura - tion and exclusivity of breastfeeding. Maternal employment can also affect whether and for how long an infant is breast - fed; mothers working full-time are less likely to breastfeed at 6 months than those working part-time or not at all. 72 In 2011, more than half of all mothers with children under 1 year of age were employed, and two-thirds of those moth - ers were employed full-time (data not shown). 73 The Affordable Care Act of 2010 helps to sup - port breastfeeding among working women by requiring break time and a private, sanitary place for nursing mothers to express breast milk during the workday. 74 Infants* Who Are Breastfed, by Race/Ethnicity and Duration, 2008 Source II.27: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Immunization Su rveyInfants* Who Are Breastfed, by Maternal Education and Duration, 2008 Source II.27: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Immunization Su rvey Percent of Infants74.6 66.1 35.444.341.1 11.6Percent of Infants *Includes only infants born in 2008; data are provisional. **Reported that child was ever breastfed or fedhuman breast milk.

Impaired fecundity varied by maternal age and parity (the number of children a woman has had). Among nulliparous women\u2014or those without a previous birth\u2014prevalence of impaired fecun - dity increased with age from only 8.0 percent of women aged 15-29 to more than one in four women aged 35-44. In contrast, impaired fecun - dity did not vary greatly with age among wom - en with a previous birth, ranging from 9 to 11 percent across age groups. Among women with a previous birth, the proportion who are surgi-cally sterile (i.e., tubal ligation or hysterectomy) increases to over 50 percent of women by age 40-44, and thus a smaller proportion are at risk of impaired fecundity (data not shown). Difficulties having a baby can be addressed with medications, surgery, artificial insemi - nation and assisted reproductive technol-ogy (ART). 75 In 2006-2010, 11.9 percent of women aged 15-44 years reported that they or their spouses or partners had ever received some form of infertility service and 4.9 percent had received medical help to prevent a miscar - riage (data not shown). The most common type of infertility service received was advice (6.5 percent), followed by infertility testing (5.0 percent) and medications to improve ovula-tion (4.0 percent). Between one-fifth and one-quarter of nulliparous women aged 35-39 and 40-44, respectively, had ever received infertil - ity services. Levels of infertility service use were also higher among non-Hispanic White women (13.4 percent) than non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women (8.6 and 9.6 percent, respec-tively; data not shown).

Among the Asian population in the United States, the largest nationalities are Chinese (22.8 percent), Asian Indian (19.4 percent), Filipino (17.4 percent), Vietnamese (10.6 percent), Ko - rean (9.7 percent), and Japanese (5.2 percent). 78 Although Asian American women are generally healthier and have the longest life expectancy of any race group, there is great variation with some groups shown to have higher rates of cer - tain conditions including diabetes, cancer, and Hepatitis B infection\u2014a virus that causes liver disease and cancer. 79 In 2006-2010, compared to non-Hispanic White women, Asian women overall were slightly more likely to report ever having been diagnosed with diabetes (7.2 versus 6.4 percent, respectively) or ever having hepatitis (3.4 ver-sus 2.6 percent, respectively). However, among subgroups with available data, only Asian In - dian women had significantly higher risk of dia - betes (12.4 percent), and only Chinese women had a higher risk of hepatitis (4.3 percent) than non-Hispanic White women. Due in part to health-related cultural beliefs, cervical cancer screening rates are lower among Asian women. 80 In 2010, 75.7 percent of Asian women aged 21-65 had received a pap smear within the past 3 years compared with 84.6 percent of non-Hispanic White women. Of the Asian subgroups with available data, only Fili - pinas had screening rates comparable to non-Hispanic White women (86.9 percent). Higher cervical cancer rates have been shown for Cam - bodian, Laotian, and Vietnamese women. 81 Liver and stomach cancer rates are also higher among many Asian groups due to infection with hepatitis and a stomach bacterium known as H. pylori, respectively; which are common in countries where many Asian Americans were born and migrated from. 81 Increasing the prevention and treatment of hepatitis and improving data collection on the health and well-being of the Asian and Pacific Islander population, including detail on eth - nic subgroups, are among the health goals of a White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. 82Percent of Wo menReceipt of Recommended Cervical Cancer Screening Among Women Aged 21-65,* by Selected Race Group, 2010 Source II.28: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Na tional Health Interview Survey *Based on U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations of a Pap smear every 3 years for women aged 21-65 years; all estimates are age-adjusted.*Reported that a health professional had ever told them that they had diabetes; reported ever having hadhepatitis; all estimates are age-adjusted. **Estimate does not meet the standards of reliability or precision.Diabetes and Hepatitis Among Women,* by Selected Race Group, 2006-2010 Source II.28: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional Health Interview SurveyPercent WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201256 HEALTH STATUS - SPECIAL POPULATIONS RURAL AND URBAN WOMEN Residents of rural areas tend to face greater socioeconomic disadvantage and live farther from health care resources than their urban counterparts. For example, rural areas have few - er physicians and dentists per capita than urban areas, and may lack certain specialists altogether. A variety of social, economic, and geographic factors are likely to contribute to higher rates of chronic disease, injury, and mortality observed in rural areas. 83 A common definition of rural and urban relies on residence outside or inside metropoli-tan statistical areas\u2014counties with an urban-ized area of at least 50,000 people or adjacent commuting counties. In 2010, over 19 million women aged 18 and older lived in non-metro - politan or rural areas, representing 16.9 percent of all women. Rural women were more likely to be older and non-Hispanic White than their urban counterparts. In 2010, the median age of ru - ral women was 3 years older than for urban women (49 versus 46 years, respectively; data not shown) and 22.7 percent of rural women were aged 65 years or older, compared to 18.1 percent of urban women. More than four out of five rural women were non-Hispanic White (81.7 percent) compared to 62.2 percent of ur - ban women (data not shown). Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women were the only other racial and ethnic group to have greater representation in rural than urban areas (1.6 versus 0.4 percent, respectively). Women living in rural areas also had lower levels of income and educational attainment than urban women. In 2010, 40.3 percent of rural women lived in households with incomes below 200 percent of poverty compared to 32.3 percent of urban women. Conversely, 38.4 per - cent of urban women had household incomes of 400 percent or more of poverty, compared to 27.1 percent of rural women. Among women aged 25 and older, 18.7 percent of rural women had a college degree or higher compared to 30.4 percent of urban women (data not shown).

Women residing in rural areas were also more likely than those living in urban areas to be physically inactive (29.2 versus 25.1 percent, respectively) and obese (30.4 versus 25.9 percent, respectively). Opportunities for regular exercise may be less accessible in some rural areas that lack side-walks or nearby trails. Reflecting greater barri - ers to care, rural women were also more likely than their urban counterparts to be uninsured (18.0 versus 14.3 percent, respectively) and to not have had a dental visit in the past year (35.6 versus 28.1 percent, respectively).Consistent with poorer indicators of health status and access to health care, rural women tend to have higher mortality rates. In 2009, the age-adjusted mortality rate for rural wom - en was 868.2 per 100,000 compared to 764.0 per 100,000 for urban women. Heart disease, chronic lower respiratory diseases, and uninten-tional injury ranked higher among the leading causes of death for rural than for urban women. However, mortality rates for every leading cause of death were higher for rural women. The larg - est absolute disparity between rural and urban women was for heart disease\u2014an excess of 23.9 deaths per 100,000 (201.2 versus 177.3 per 100,000, respectively). Unintentional injury mortality had the largest relative disparity; the mortality rate was 53.1 percent higher for rural versus urban women (42.1 versus 27.5 deaths per 100,000, respectively). In particular, motor vehicle accident deaths were more than twice as high for rural compared to urban women (14.4 versus 6.5 per 100,000; data not shown). The Health Resources and Services Adminis - tration's Office of Rural Health Policy provides funding to rural hospitals and state offices of ru - ral health to improve access and quality of care in rural areas. 84 Other HRSA programs, such as Community Health Centers and the National Health Service Corps, aim to improve health care capacity in underserved rural and urban areas.Percent of Wo menSelected Health Indicators Among Women Aged 18 and Older, by Rural/Urban Residence,* 2010 Source II.7: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance SystemAge-Adjusted Mortality Rates Per 100,000 Females Aged 15 and Older , by Leading Cause of Death and Rural/Urban Residence,* 2009 Source II.19: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional Vital InsuranceObesePhysically Inactive**Cigarette Smoking *Defined as residence in non-metropolitan (rural) and metropolitan (urban) statistical areas; all estimates are age-adjusted.Rural Rate (Rank)Urban Rate (Rank) Total 868.2 (-) 764.0 (-) Heart Disease 201.2 (1) 177.3 (2) Malignant Neoplasms 194.0 (2) 184.7 (1) Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases 56.7 (3) 46.0 (4) Cerebrovascular Disease (Stroke) 56.3 (4) 46.1 (3) Unintentional Injury 42.1 (5) 27.5 (6) Alzheimer's Disease 36.2 (6) 31.2 (5) Diabetes Mellitus 27.1 (7) 21.5 (7) WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201258 HEALTH STATUS - SPECIAL POPULATIONS WOMEN VETERANS As of September 2012, women were estimat - ed to comprise more than 1.8 million, or 8.6 percent, of all living veterans. This represents a 33 percent increase since 2002, when women represented 6.4 percent of all living veterans, and this percentage is expected to increase in future years. By 2035, women are projected to make up 15 percent of all veterans\u2014similar to the current proportion of active duty military personnel that are female. 85 The largest group of living women veterans today are from the Gulf War Era and the most recent conflicts: Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and Operation New Dawn (OND). The continu - ally changing military roles of women, multiple deployments, and the blurring of combat and non-combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan suggest that the needs of these women veterans may differ greatly from the needs of women vet-erans from previous eras. Due to the more recent increase in military enrollment and opportunities for women, fe-male veterans are much younger than their male counterparts. In 2010, 21.6 percent of female veterans were aged 18-34 compared to only 6.9 percent of male veterans. Conversely, 44.0 per - cent of male veterans were aged 65 and older compared to only 15.8 percent of female vet - erans. Expressed differently, women comprised 19.6 percent of all veterans aged 18-34 years but only 2.7 percent of veterans aged 65 and older (data not shown). In addition to being younger, women veter - ans are also more racially diverse and more highly educated than their male counterparts. In 2010, 31.8 percent of women veterans were of minor -ity race or ethnicity compared to 18.5 percent of male veterans. Female veterans were particularly more likely to be non-Hispanic Black than male veterans (19.3 versus 10.2 percent, respectively). Nearly 80 percent of women veterans had ob - tained post-secondary education beyond high school (78.1 percent) compared to 60.9 percent of male veterans (data not shown). Relative to civilian non-veteran women, fe- male veterans tend to be slightly older, more likely to be non-Hispanic Black, more educat - ed, and less likely to be in poverty. 86 Overall, in 2010, a higher proportion of fe - male than male veterans reported having a ser - vice-connected disability (18.0 versus 15.4 per-cent, respectively)\u2014determined by the Veterans Benefits Administration as injuries or illnesses incurred or aggravated during military service.

At older ages, male veterans are more likely to have a service-connected disability than women veterans. For example, for those aged 65 and older, 12.0 per - cent of male veterans had a service-connected disability compared to 9.0 percent of women vet - erans. The most prevalent service-connected dis - abilities for women veterans in 2009 were post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), lower back pain, and migraines, accounting for 15 percent of service-connected disabilities (data not shown). 86 Among users of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care, a link between PTSD and military sexual trauma\u2014defined as sexual as - sault and/or severe and threatening sexual harass - ment that occurred during military service\u2014may be stronger for women than men. 87 For the above reasons and despite higher edu - cational attainment and income,86 women veter- ans may face greater health challenges compared to civilian women. 88 In 2010, women veterans were more likely than their civilian counterparts to report smoking (18.5 versus 15.5 percent, respectively), being overweight or obese (61.2 versus 55.9 percent, respectively), and having limitations in activity due to physical, mental, or emotional problems (29.3 versus 20.7 per-cent, respectively). Women veterans were also more likely than civilian women to report hav - ing poor mental health on 14 or more days in the past month (18.1 versus 12.5 percent, re - spectively). Levels of activity limitations and frequent mental distress were also higher than those reported by male veterans (23.3 and 11.1 percent of male veterans, respectively; data not shown). However, women veterans were more likely than civilian women to have received a past-year preventive visit (76.2 versus 72.0 per - cent, respectively). Today, more than 337,000 women veterans or 19 percent of all women veterans use VA health care, double the number from a decade ago. 89 The VA is improving services to make sure women who are eligible for VA care can access services tailored to their needs and has expanded research on the impacts of trauma and combat exposure for women, mental health outcomes of civilian reintegration, and overall health care needs of women veterans.

Access to health care is critical to prevent the onset of disease, as well as to identify health issues early and prevent disease progression. Al - though health care is important for all women, it may be particularly important among women who have poor health status, chronic condi-tions, or disabilities. Appropriate utilization can be hampered by limited financial resources and lack of health insurance or comprehensive in-surance, as well as language, transportation, and other barriers. This section presents data on women's use of health services, including data on women's health insurance coverage, usual source of care, health care expenditures, and use of various ser - vices, such as preventive care, HIV testing, oral health care, and mental health services. A new topic within this section explores women's use of the internet for health information. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201261 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION HEALTH INSURANCE People who are uninsured face substantial financial barriers to health care, which can result in delayed diagnoses and poor health outcomes, including premature death. 1 In 2010, 42.6 million adults (18.4 percent) were uninsured, up from 37.5 million adults (16.7 percent) in 2007 (2007 data not shown). The recent rise in the uninsured population has been attributed to job loss and the economic recession. 1 The percentage of people who are uninsured varies considerably across a number of factors, including age, sex, marital status, race and ethnicity, income, and education. Among adults in 2010, those aged 18-24 years were most likely to lack health insurance (27.2 percent). However, those aged 18-24 years were the only group to experience a significant decline in uninsurance between 2009 and 2010, 2 which is likely attributable to the Affordable Care Act provision allowing children to stay on their parents' insurance plan until age 26. 1 Men aged 18-64 years were more likely than women of the same age to be uninsured. The lowest rate of uninsurance was among adults aged 65 and older, most of whom are eligible for Medicare coverage. In 2010, 67.8 percent of women aged 18- 64 years had private health insurance, 17.1 percent had public insurance, and 19.6 percent were uninsured. This distribution varied by marital status: women who were married and whose spouse was present were most likely to have private insurance coverage (77.8 percent) and least likely to be uninsured (14.2 percent). Conversely, women who were married, but whose spouse was absent or reported being separated were least likely to have private health insurance (48.7 and 47.2 percent, respectively) and most likely to be uninsured (32.2 and 30.3 percent, respectively). Women who were separated from their spouses or widowed were most likely to have public health insurance coverage (26.9 and 25.9 percent, respectively).

Adults aged 19 and older accounted for about half of Medicaid enrollees (31.9 mil - lion), and women accounted for 68.2 percent of all adult enrollees. Medicaid serves as a criti - cal safety net for those who might otherwise be uninsured; increasing enrollment has helped to offset declines in employer-sponsored coverage, but more notably for children than adults due to greater eligibility and expansions for children. 1 Women accounted for a larger proportion of adult Medicaid enrollees in every age group, most noticeably among those aged 19-44 and 85 years and older (72.5 and 79.3 percent, re - spectively). Nearly 13.5 million women, repre-senting 62.0 percent of adult female Medicaid enrollees, were of childbearing age (data not shown). Because the Medicaid eligibility thresh - old is lowered in the postpartum period, 31 States have expanded family planning through a Federal waiver or State plan amendments to cover women who would not otherwise be eli - gible for Medicaid. 4 Medicare is the Nation's health insurance program for people aged 65 years and older, some people under age 65 with disabilities, and those with end-stage renal disease (permanent kidney failure). Medicare has four components: Part A covers hospital, skilled nursing, home health, and hospice care; Part B covers physician services, outpatient services, and durable medi - cal equipment; Part C (Medicare Advantage Plans) allows beneficiaries to purchase coverage through private insurers; and Part D allows for coverage of prescription drugs through private insurers. 3 In 2010, 55.2 percent of Medicare's 47.7 mil- lion enrollees were female (data not shown). Due to age-related eligibility, those in older age groups accounted for a greater proportion of overall en-rollment among both women and men. How - ever, a greater proportion of male enrollees were under 65 compared to female enrollees (19.6 ver - sus 14.6 percent, respectively). In contrast, adults aged 85 years and older comprised a greater pro - portion of female than male enrollees. (14.4 ver-sus 8.5 percent, respectively), due to the longer life expectancy of women.

In 2008-2010, 11.8 percent or 26.4 million adults reported that they delayed getting medi - cal care in the past year due to various logistical or structural factors, such as not being able to get an appointment soon enough and inconvenient office hours (data not shown). Women were more likely than men to report having delayed care due to logistical barriers in the past year (13.5 versus 9.9 percent, respectively). For both men and women, those with public insurance or no insurance were more likely to report hav - ing delayed care as a result of logistical factors than those with private coverage. For example, 12.0 percent of women with private health in - surance reported having delayed care compared to 17.1 percent of women with public coverage and 14.8 percent of uninsured women. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women also were more likely than non-Hispanic White women to report delayed care due to logistical barriers (16.3 and 16.7 versus 12.2 percent, respectively; data not shown). Women were also slightly more likely than men to have forgone needed health care due to cost (13.0 versus 11.1 percent, respectively). For both women and men, the proportion who de - layed needed care due to cost varied by poverty level. Among women, about one-fifth of those living in households with incomes less than 200 percent of poverty experienced an unmet need for health care due to cost, compared to 13.5 percent of those with household incomes of 200-399 percent of poverty and 6.5 percent of those with household incomes of 400 percent or more of poverty. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 helps to remove financial barriers to care by expanding Medicaid eligibility for more low-income people, mandating employer-sponsored coverage for large employers, establishing state-based insur - ance exchanges, and requiring insurance cover-age under new health plans to cover preventive services without copays or cost-sharing. 6 Adults Aged 18 and Older who Delayed Care Due to Logistical Barriers* in Past Year, by Type of Insurance, 2008-2010 Source II.8: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Na tional Health Interview Survey *Reported that they delayed getting medical care in the past year due to any of five reasons: couldn't get through on phone, couldn't get appointment soon enough, office room wait too long, inconvenient officehours, no transportation. *Reported that they needed but did not get medical care because they could not afford it; excludes dental care. **Poverty level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $22,314 for a family of four in 2010.Adults Aged 18 and Older with Unmet Need for Health Care* Due to Cost, by Poverty Status** and Sex, 2008-2010 Source II.8: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional Health Interview SurveyPercent of Adults48121620 400% More WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201264 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION USUAL SOURCE OF CARE In 2008-2010, 88.3 percent of women re - ported having a usual source of care (a place where one usually goes when sick, such as a physician's office or health center), compared to 79.0 percent of men (data not shown). Having a usual source of care is more common among older adults. For example, nearly all women aged 65 years and older (97.2 percent) had a usual source of care compared to 80.9 percent of women aged 18-34 years (data not shown). Having a usual source of care has been shown to improve care quality and the receipt of preven - tive services. 7 Overall, non-Hispanic White women were most likely to report a usual source of care (90.1 percent), while Hispanic women were least likely to do so (80.8 percent; data not shown). The proportion of women of different races and ethnicities who have a usual source of care varied by health insurance coverage. Overall, approximately 94 percent of women with pri-vate or public insurance had a usual source of care compared to 59.6 percent of uninsured women. Among women with private or pub - lic insurance, those reporting a usual source of care exceeded 90 percent for all racial and eth - nic groups. Women lacking health insurance were least likely to have a usual source of care, with significant variation by race and ethnic - ity. Among women without health insurance, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native, non-Hispanic White, and non-Hispanic Black women were most likely to report a usual source of care (71.7, 64.0, and 61.3 percent, respec-tively), while only about half of uninsured His - panic, non-Hispanic women of multiple races, and non-Hispanic Asian women had a usual place to go when they were sick. Having both a usual source of care and health insurance cover - age has been found to significantly reduce prob - lems obtaining needed medical care and delay - ing or forgoing needed care. 8Percent of Wo menWomen Aged 18 and Older with a Usual Source of Care,* by Health Insurance Status and Race/Ethnicity,** 2008-2010 Source II.8: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth St atistics, Na tional age-adjusted. **The sample of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders was too NativeHispanic Non-Hispanic BlackNon-Hispanic WhiteTotal WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201265 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION PREVENTIVE CARE Preventive health care, including counseling, education, and screening, can help prevent or minimize the effects of many serious health con-ditions. In 2010, 72.3 percent of women report - ed that they had received a routine checkup or general physical exam that was not for a specific injury, illness, or condition, compared to 63.4 percent of men. For both men and women, the receipt of preventive health care increased with age and exceeded 85 percent among those aged 65 years and older. Among those aged 18-44 years, however, women were much more likely than men to have had a preventive checkup (66.1 versus 53.4 percent, respectively). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force rec- ommends specific screening tests, counseling, immunizations, and preventive medications for a variety of diseases and conditions including several types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, injury, infectious diseases, mental health, and substance abuse. 9 For example, biennial breast cancer screenings (mammograms) are recom-mended for every woman aged 50-74 years and cervical cancer screenings (Pap smears) are recommended every 3 years for women aged 21-65 years. In 2010, 79.8 percent of women aged 50-74 years reported receiving a mammo - gram within the past 2 years and 84.5 percent of women aged 21-65 reported receiving a Pap smear within the past 3 years. Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native and non-His - panic women of multiple races were less likely than women of other races and ethnicities to have met the mammogram guidelines (65.5 and 72.7 percent, respectively). Non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native, and women of multiple races were least likely to have met the Pap smear guidelines (74.6, 77.8, and 78.1 percent, respectively). Under the Affordable Care Act, women's pre-ventive health care, such as breast and cervical cancer screening, prenatal care, and other ser-vices, is covered with no cost-sharing for new health plans. 10Percent of AdultsPast Year Preventive Check-up Among Adults Aged 18 and Older ,* By Age and Sex, 2010 Source II.7: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Behavioral Risk F actor Su rveillance SystemReceipt of Recommended Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening Among Women,* by Race/Ethnicity, 2010 Source II.7: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Behavioral Risk Factor Su rveillance System 66.163.468.3 53.474.886.0 YearsTotal *Report of a routine checkup in the past year , defined as a general physical exam that was not for a specific injury , illness, or condition; total estimates are age-adjusted.*Based on U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations of biennial mammography for women aged 50-74 years and a Pap smear every three years for women aged 21-65 years; all estimates are WhiteTotal65.584.6 72.778.174.680.385.4 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201266 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION VACCINATION Vaccination is one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century, resulting in dramatic declines in mortality and morbidity for many infectious diseases. 11 An annual influenza (flu) vaccination is now recommended for all persons aged 6 months and older; however, it is especially important for certain groups, includ - ing pregnant women and older adults, who are at higher risk for flu complications. 12 In November of 2011, only 43.2 percent of pregnant women reported receiving flu vaccine for the 2011-2012 season. Those with household incomes less than 100 percent of poverty were less likely to have received vaccination than those living at or above poverty (38.8 versus 45.2 percent, respectively). To prevent potentially fatal infection in the new - born, a tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular per-tussis (whooping cough) vaccine (Tdap) is also recommended for pregnant women (>20 weeks' gestation) if they have not received Tdap vacci - nation in the last 10 years. 13 In 2011, only 24.2 percent of pregnant women reported having re-ceived a current Tdap vaccination. Tdap vacci-nation was lower among pregnant women with household incomes below poverty compared to those with higher incomes (20.5 versus 25.3 per - cent, respectively). Pneumococcal vaccination protects against a bacterial infection that may cause pneumonia or other illnesses that can lead to severe complica-tions including death. Pneumococcal vaccina - tion is recommended for young children, adults aged 65 years and older, those with certain health conditions including asthma, and for adults who smoke cigarettes. 12 In 2010, 61.3 percent of women aged 65 and older reported ever receiving a pneumococcal vaccination. Pneumococcal vac -cination was lower among women with house - hold incomes of less than 100 percent of poverty, compared to those with higher incomes (42.2 versus 64.1 percent, respectively). Shingles vaccination, first recommended in 2006, protects against herpes zoster\u2014a reactiva - tion of the virus that causes chickenpox, which is called shingles. Shingles occurs mostly in older adults and produces a skin rash that can create de - bilitating pain lasting months or even years. The shingles vaccine is recommended for all persons aged 60 years and older, except for those with conditions that severely weaken the immune sys - tem. 12 In 2010, only 16.0 percent of women aged 60 and older reported receiving the shingles vac - cination. Shingles vaccination was lower among women with household incomes below 100 per-cent of poverty than those with higher incomes (9.1 versus 17.4 percent, respectively).Percent of Wo menReceipt of Selected Vaccinations* Among Pregnant Women, by Poverty Status,** 201 1 Source III.2: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Internet Panel Su rveyReceipt of Selected Vaccinations* Among Wo men, by Recommended Age Group and Poverty Status,** 2010 Source III.3: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional Health Interview Survey 43.238.8 24.245.2 20.525.3Total Less than 100% of Poverty 100% or More of Poverty 1428425670 Tdap Influenza *Having ever received the pneumonia shot; zoster or Shingles vaccine. **Poverty level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $22,113 for a family of four in 2010.*Having received the influenza vaccination since August 1, 2011; having received the tetanus shot including acellular pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine since 2005, when Tdap first became licensedand recommended. **Poverty level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $22,81 1 for a family of four in 201 1.

It is recommend - ed that people who meet any of the following criteria be tested at least annually for HIV: those who have injected drugs or steroids, or shared drug use equipment (such as needles); have had unprotected sex with men who have sex with men, anonymous partners, or multiple partners; have exchanged sex for drugs or money; have been diagnosed with hepatitis, tuberculosis, or a sexually transmitted infection; received a blood transfusion between 1978 and 1985; or have had unprotected sex with anyone who meets any of these criteria. 14 In addition, the CDC recommends that all health care providers in - clude HIV testing as part of their patients' rou - tine health care and that all pregnant women be tested during their pregnancy. In 2008-2010, 40.3 percent of adults in the United States had ever been tested for HIV (data not shown). Overall, women were more likely than men to have been tested (44.1 versus 36.6 percent, respectively). Within younger age groups (18-44 years), women were more likely to have been tested than men, however, men were more likely to have been tested at older ages (45 years and older).With respect to race and ethnicity, non-His - panic Black women and men were most likely to have ever been tested (59.6 and 55.9 percent, respectively), while non-Hispanic Asian wom-en and men were least likely to have ever been tested (34.7 and 30.7 percent, respectively). Women were generally more likely than men to have ever been tested for HIV within every race and ethnic group. Among women who had not been tested, 78.6 percent reported that they had not been tested because they thought it was unlikely they had been exposed and 19.1 percent reported that there was no particular reason they had not done so (data not shown).Percent of Adults Percent of AdultsAdults Aged 18 and Older Who Have Ever Been Tested for HIV, by Age and Sex, 2008-2010 Source II.8: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Na tional Health Interview SurveyAdults Aged 18 and Older Who Have Ever Been Tested for HIV, * by Race/Ethnicity,** 2008-2010 Source II.8: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Na tional Health Interview Survey Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders was too small to produce reliable results. *Total estimates are age-adjusted.10203040506070 Non-Hispanic Multiple RaceNon-Hispanic AsianNon-Hispanic American Indian/ NativeHispanic Non-Hispanic BlackNon-Hispanic WhiteFemale Male WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201268 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION MENTAL HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION In 2009-2010, nearly 31 million, or 13.6 percent of adults in the United States reported receiving mental health treatment in the past year for a mental, behavioral, or emotional dis-order other than a substance use disorder. Wom - en were more likely than men to receive treat-ment or counseling (17.5 versus 9.4 percent), which is roughly commensurate with the higher prevalence of mental illness (excluding sub - stance use disorder) among women (see page on Mental Illness). 15 Utilization of mental health services was more common among women with higher educational attainment. Approximately 20 percent of college-educated women reported past year mental health treatment compared to 13.2 percent of women without a high school diploma. Over 17 million women aged 18 years and older reported using prescription medication for treatment of a mental or emotional con - dition, representing 15.1 percent of women, which is almost twice the proportion of men (7.7 percent). Women were also nearly twice as likely as men to report receiving outpatient mental health treatment (8.4 versus 4.6 percent, respectively). Less than 1 percent of men and women received inpatient treatment in 2009-2010 (data not shown).In 2009-2010, mental health services were needed, but not received in the previous year, by about 11.5 million adults, corresponding to 5.1 percent of adults in the United States. Wom - en were almost twice as likely as men to have an unmet need for mental health treatment or counseling in the past year (6.6 versus 3.4 percent, respectively; data not shown). Among women, cost was the most commonly reported reason for not receiving needed services (46.9 percent) followed by the belief that the problem could be handled without treatment (26.5 per-cent), not having enough time (17.6 percent), and not knowing where to go for treatment (15.1 percent).

Untreated dental disease can produce significant pain and disability, and can result in tooth loss. In addition to daily brushing and flossing, the American Dental Association rec - ommends regular dental exams and cleanings. 16 Overall, 60.7 percent of adults reported having a dental visit in 2008-2010 (data not shown). Women were somewhat more likely to have had a past-year dental visit than men (64.1 and 57.0 percent, respectively). Among both men and women, those with higher levels of education were more likely to have had a dental visit. For example, 80.9 percent of women with a college degree or higher had a past year dental visit, compared to only 41.6 percent of women with less than a high school education. Similarly, three-quarters of men with at least a college degree reported a past-year visit compared to 35.0 percent of those who did not graduate high school. The proportion of women experiencing an unmet need for oral health care varies by race and ethnicity. In 2008-2010, 16.5 percent of women reported that they did not obtain needed dental care in the past year because they could not afford it; however, unmet need for care ranged from 9.1 percent among non-Hispanic Asian women to 30.3 percent among non-Hispanic women of multiple races. Cost remains a significant barrier to receiving dental health services, even among adults with health insurance. Approximately 10 percent of women with private health insurance reported that they did not obtain needed dental care in the past year due to costs, while the same was true for 18.8 percent of women with public coverage. Those without insurance fared worse, however, with 43.4 percent of uninsured women report - ing that they did not obtain needed care due to costs (data not shown). Even those with public or private insurance may face cost barriers due to limited or no coverage for dental services. 17 Unmet Need for Dental Care Due to Cost Among Women Aged 18 and Older,* by Race/Ethnicity,** 2008-2010 Source II.8: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Na tional Health Interview Survey *Past year report of needing dental care but not getting it because of cost. **The sample of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders was too small to produce reliable results.Past Year Dental Vi sit Among Adults Aged 18 and Older, by Level of Education, 2008-2010 Source II.8: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional Health Degree NativeHispanic Non-Hispanic BlackNon-Hispanic WhiteTotal18.130.3 9.1 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201270 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES In 2009, the majority of total health care ex- penses for both women and men were covered by public or private health insurance. For both men and women, about 40 percent of expenses were paid by private insurance and about 35 percent were paid by Medicare or Medicaid. However, compared to men, health care costs for women were more likely to be paid out of pocket (15.3 versus 14.1 percent) and less likely to be paid by other sources (8.1 versus 11.3 per - cent). In 2009, 90.0 percent of women had at least one health care expense, compared to 77.6 per - cent of men (data not shown). Among adults who had at least one health care expense, the av - erage expenditure per person, including expens - es covered by insurance and those paid out-of-pocket, was slightly higher for women ($6,011) than for men ($5,389). However, men's average expenditures significantly exceeded women's for hospital inpatient services ($20,268 versus $14,558, respectively). Women's expenditures significantly exceeded men's only in the category of office-based medical services ($1,772 versus $1,447, respectively). The overall mean health care expense was greater for women because of the greater percentage of women incurring more expensive services. For instance, 10.3 per-cent of women had hospital inpatient services, which includes childbirth delivery, compared to 6.4 percent of men. Overall per capita health care expenditures have increased substantially in the past de - cade. In 2009, average health care expenses for women and men were 83.0 and 87.9 percent higher than in 1999 (data not shown). The in - creasing development and utilization of new technologies may account for a large part of ris - ing health care expenses. 18 The Affordable Care Act of 2010 contains a number of provisions to reduce costs to consumers and more generally, for example by limiting co-payments for cov-ered benefits and testing new payment systems for Medicare to improve quality and efficiency. 18 MaleFemaleHealth Care Expenses of Adults Aged 18 and Older, by Sex and Source of Payment*, 2009 Source III.4: U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, M edical Expenditure Panel SurveyMean Health Care Expenses of Adults Aged 18 and Older with an Expense, by Category of Service and Sex, 2009 Source III.4: U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, M edical per Person*Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding. **Includes T ricare (Armed-Forces-related coverage).

In comparison, cervical cancer screenings ap- pear to be more accessible to women with com-mercial coverage than to those covered by Med-icaid. Among women aged 21-64 years, cervical cancer screenings were received at least once during the previous 3 years by 77.0 percent of commercially-insured women and 67.2 percent of those covered by Medicaid. Cervical cancer is almost entirely preventable with appropriate screening, evaluation, and treatment. 22 [See pages on Cancer and Preventive Care.] In 2010, women with commercial insur - ance coverage were also more likely than those with Medicaid to have received timely prenatal and postpartum care. More than 90 percent of commercially-insured women received prenatal care in either their first trimester or within 42 days of enrollment, compared to 83.7 percent of those covered by Medicaid. Similarly, 80.7 per - cent of women with commercial coverage had a postpartum visit between 21 and 56 days after delivery, compared to 64.4 percent of women participating in Medicaid. Although Medicaid-insured women are less likely to have received timely prenatal and postpartum care than com - mercially-insured women, they have made great-er improvements since 2001. For example, the proportion of women receiving timely postpar - tum care increased 21.5 percent among Medic - aid participants compared to 4.8 percent among commercially-insured postpartum women.

Overall, women were more likely than men to have utilized this resource (50.9 versus 39.8 percent, respectively). Internet use for health information also varied by age. Among women, those aged 25-44 years were most likely to use the Internet for health information (63.1 percent) while similar percentages of men, about 40 percent, had used the Internet for health information between 18 and 64 years of age. For both women and men, those aged 65 and older were least likely to use the Internet for health information and there was no significant sex difference among this age group (21.9 and 24.4 percent, respectively). Internet use for health information increased greatly with income and education. Among women, two-thirds of those with household incomes of 400 percent or more of poverty had used the Internet for health information in the past year, compared to less than one-third of those with incomes below the poverty level (66.3 versus 29.2 percent, respectively). Similarly, women with a college degree were more than 5 times as likely as women who had not finished high school to have used the Internet for health information (74.6 versus 14.5 percent, respectively; data not shown). With respect to race and ethnicity, Internet use for health information was highest among non-Hispanic White women (57.0 percent) and lowest among Hispanic women (31.9 percent; data not shown).Percent of Adults Percent of AdultsAdults Aged 18 and Older Who Used the Internet for Health Information in Past Year, by Age and Sex, 2009 Source II.8: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Na tional Health Interview SurveyAdults Aged 18 and Older Who Used the Internet for Health Information in Past Year, by Poverty Status* and Sex, 2009 Source II.8: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Na tional Health Interview Survey YearsTotal level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $23,021 for a family of four in 2009.10203040506070 400% or More of Poverty200-399% of Poverty100-199% of PovertyLess 100% of PovertyFemale Male WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201273 HRSA PROGRAMS RELATED TO WOMEN'S HEALTH The U.S. Department of Health and Hu - man Services , Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is the Federal agency responsible for improving access to health care services for people who are uninsured, isolated or medically vulnerable. HRSA's goal to \"Build Healthy Communities,\" includes a focus on health promotion and disease prevention through community-led strategies, including community health workers, peer-to-peer engagement, and public-private collaborations. The Office of Women's Health (OWH) is the agency lead for women's health policy and programming. OWH leads collaborations to strengthen HRSA programs focusing on reduc-ing sex and gender-based disparities and sup - porting comprehensive, culturally competent, and quality health care. Priorities include vio - lence prevention activities coordination; mobile health utilized as a health education strategy for underserved women; and the HRSA-supported Women's Preventive Health Service Guidelines under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) supports access to comprehensive women's health care to improve their health across the life course through the Title V MCH Block Grant, Home Visitation, and Healthy Start Programs. MCHB is focused on the integration of strategies to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality, and supporting the provisions under the ACA to promote primary preventive health services for women. The HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB) provides re - sources and services for individuals living with HIV/AIDS through the Ryan White Program; Part D, in particular, addresses the needs of wom - en, infants, children and youth, and their fami - lies. HAB funds two Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) which include Enhancing Access to and Retention in Quality HIV/AIDS Care for Women of Color and Enhancing En - gagement and Retention in Quality HIV Care for T ransgender Women of Color. The Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) funds the Health Center Program, which provides comprehensive primary health care to low income, uninsured, and other vulner - able populations. In 2011, Community Health Centers served more than 9 million women aged 15 and older, representing 62.1 percent of all pa - tients aged 15 and older. In 2012, BPHC pro - vided supplemental funding to 810 community health centers to improve care quality and ensure more women are screened for cervical cancer. The Bureau of Clinician Recruitment and Service (BCRS) administers the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) program, which con -sists of a cadre of nearly 10,000 clinicians who are frontline health care workers. Seventy-four percent of current NHSC members are female. NHSC supports female providers by offering various resources and webinars related to wom-en's health and up to 35 days of maternity leave without incurring any extension of their service. The Bureau of Health Professions (BHPr) provides policy leadership and health profes - sions training grants to produce a workforce that can provide high-quality, culturally appropriate care, particularly in medically underserved ar - eas. Initiatives include boosting the primary care workforce, promoting interprofessional teams, and integrating population health into train - ing programs. BHPr supports women's health continuing education programs to address early detection and prevention across the life span, on topics such as prenatal health, breastfeeding, and breast and cervical cancer. The Office of Rural Health Policy (ORHP) addresses the needs of rural populations. One community-level resource is the Rural Health Care Services Outreach program. In addition, ORHP is funding several Rural Research Centers that have projects focusing on prevention, home visitation utilizing community health work - ers, and women's health, and a research project \"Quality of Women's Care in Rural Health Clin - ics: A National Analysis.\" WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 201274 ENDNOTES Population Characteristics 1.
