Circumstance Response/Options Overview of the Board and Division (Investigation Unit) functions: The Board or Commission's primary function is that of a regulatory body that makes licensure decisions and monitors compliance with the statute and regulations governing the profession . The professional statutes and regulations are found in centralized statutes of Title 8, and also in the statutes and regulations specific to each board, commission, or occupational area. Complaints : All written complaints , or reports, alleging a violation of statute or regulations should provide a specific and detailed summary of the complaint ; the complainant must include any documentation or witnesses they feel supports the allegation of wrongdoing and, in healthcare complaints, a release for patient records. Upon receipt, the complaint and evidence are reviewed by investigators to ensure jurisdiction over the person named in the complaint and the alleged violation by that person. This review takes into account, informal guidelines established by the Board or Commission, and the statutes and regulations of that specific practice area. If the complaint does not appear to allege a violation that is within the Board's jurisdiction, the Division may close the c omplaint . If the complaint does center on a violation that is within the Board's jurisdiction, an initial letter may be sent to the licensee against whom the complaint is filed. This letter provides notice of the complaint and allegations and may request records, an interview, or other response b y the licensee. Complaints that present an immediate threat to public safety are given priority; however, all complaints are investigated as quickly as possible. The steps taken in the investigation are determined on a case by case basis by the specific s of the allegations. This portion of the investigative process may be quite lengthy and may require additional information or evidence from the complainant, licensee, businesses, other governmental agencies or state boards, witnesses, or related parties. Inquiry and Investigation : The Investigators conduct an inquiry into the complaint; generally, the steps for an inquiry include the following: obtaining records, documentation and evidence related to the complaint; locating and interviewing the complainant, the client, the subject and any witnesses; drafting and serving subpoenas for necessary information. Overview of the Board and Division Page 2 of 3 After investigators have gathered pertinent information or evidence to prove or disprove an alleged violation , the matter is reviewed with the Chief Investigator and, when appropriate, the Board or Commission's liaison , a panel of two Board Members , or an expert in the field . This review may result in a recommend ation that more information be obtained, the case be closed, or that the case continue forward. The Board's liaison or review panel does not determine guilt or innocence; it simply reviews the complaint to determine whether the allegations, supported by un-contested or sufficient evidence, would warrant proceeding with disciplinary action even if contested by the licensee. If the complaint is supported by evidence, it proceeds to a case, or investigation. Once a n investigation is opened, the licensee is notified they are under official investigation by the Division on behalf of the Board or Commission. This distinguishes between allegations brought against a licensee and a matter where allegations were brought and it was determined the licensee committed a violation of statutes or regulations governing their license. This is an important step because complaints can be unfounded or determined to be unsupported by evidence, and they are closed before becoming an official investi gation, protecting the subject of the complaint from unwarranted repercussions in the community or area of practice. If a violation is supported by evidence and the matter proceeds to an investigation, the next step is determining an appropriate result. Disposition of Cases : The majority of cases are resolved through a Consent Agreement , an amicable settlement of a case short of a public hearing; this Agreement spells out agreed upon disciplinary action between the Board and the licensee and allows more o ptions in achieving a balanced resolution for both parties. The Consent Agreement is written by the Division, in consultation with a Reviewing Board or Commission Member; they consider the nature of the violation, the standard in effect at the time it was violated, the effect of the violation on the public and the profession, whether the respondent was knowing and willful, previous violations, whether the licensee was cooperative and took responsibility for the violation, any mitigating circumstances, the disciplinary action's effect on improving the licensee's practices, precedents set by other cases for consistency from case to case , and if appropriate, a necessary deterrent for other practitioners to avoid a similar violation . Overview of the Board a nd Division Page 3 of 3 Consent Agreements may involve any of the following: reprimand revocation assessment of a civil penalty (fine) suspension (for a specific period of time) probation condition to take additional C ontinuing Education over and above the annual requirement restrictions on practice (some Boards) If an Agreement with the licensee is unsuccessful, the case is referred to the investigators' counsel, an Assistant Attorney General (AAG) , for review and possible litigation, filing an Accusation charging the violations. If an Accusation is filed, the licensee is entitled to a hearing on the charges against them. After guidance from the Board or Commission and the Division, the AAG may approach the licensee to negotiate a set tlement prior to a hearing. If a settlement cannot be reached, an administrative hearing will be held. All involved parties may be requested to appear and testify at the hearing , conducted by the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). After the hearing , OAH provides the Board or Commission with a proposed decision and order ; the Board or Commission may adopt , amend, or reject the proposed decision and issue their own Decision and Order . Any Decision and Order adopted by the Board or Commission may be a ppealed to the Superior Court by the licensee . The Division does not intervene in a dispute regarding the fees charged by a licensee. Disciplinary action is considered carefully on a case -by-case basis since the action may adversely affect the licensee reputation and ability to make a living. Therefore, i t takes more than a claim of wrongdoing to file a complaint with the Board; the allegation must be substantiated and must be jurisdictional to the statutes and regulations of that Board or practice area. Confidentiality : Investigations are required by statute to be kept confidential. This often prevents the complainant, licensee, and the Board from obtaining progress reports or information that may disclose the current status of an open investigation. This also protects the reputation of licensees who may be accused of wrongdoing but the allegations against them are unproven. Cases often involve other agencies, businesses, and practices; disclosing information during an on-going case can compromise the investigation, create conflicts for reviewing Board members, or result in unnecessary hardship to the licensee .

Michael Fritz (OH) Chair2 NASBA State Board Report /Fall 2021NASBA' s 114th Annual Meeting returned to the virtual stage for the second consecutive year amid continued COVID-19 concerns. The two-day meeting, held via Zoom November 2-3, 2021, attracted a record total attendance of 519 state board representatives and stakeholders, representing 54 U.S. jurisdictions. Following the theme \"Persevere,\" the meeting featured a variety of plenary sessions, leadership updates and opportunities for NASBA members to engage and discuss emerging topics. Chief among the topics discussed include CPA Evolution, CPA Exam and Pipeline as presented by NASBA Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Colleen Conrad and AICPA Vice President - Examinations and Pipeline Michael Decker; Achieving Diversity, Equity and Inclusion featuring NABA President & CEO Guylaine Saint Juste and NASBA Chief Ethics and Diversity Officer Alfonzo Alexander; Enhancing Board Resources led by members of NASBA' s Peer Review Compliance Committee and Innovations in the EY Internship and Education Program featuring Ellen Glazerman, ED, Ernst & Young Foundation and Americas Director, University Relations of EY . In his State of NASBA address, NASBA President and Chief Executive Officer Ken L. Bishop thanked governance volunteers and staff for making the Association' s success possible and assured Annual Meeting attendees that even with business disruptions including a reduction in CPA Examination candidates entering and progressing through the CPA Pipeline, NASBA is strong, more viable and will continue to persevere, as the Association works to fulfill its mission during a global pandemic. President Bishop cited several organizational achievements in his presentation, including: Maintained stakeholder relationships Adopted a new Strategic Plan Broadened infrastructure investments Began implementation of CPA Evolution Enhanced focus on diversity, equity and inclusion Dedicated staff and resources to address CPA Pipeline issues Focus on reduction of technical debt over next few years Implemented enhanced security training for staff Acquired new membership data platform He concluded his address by emphasizing the significance of making CPA Pipeline a high priority, reminding attendees that \"becoming a CPA remains a promising career opportunity.\" He also challenged regulators and members of the profession to \"embrace changes to attract students with an interest in artificial intelligence, information technology and to \"do more to educate students on the potential of the professional CPA career.\" NASBA leadership remains optimistic that the 115th Annual Meeting will be held in-person, October 30 - November 2, 2022, in San Diego, CA. t114th Annual Meeting Attracts Over 500 In a statement recently issued to Boards of Accountancy and members of the academic community, NASBA announced that due to the necessary and important focus on bringing CPA Evolution to fruition, NASBA has ceased publishing the Candidate Performance on the Uniform CPA Examination publication until this important transition is completed. This is effective with the 2020 edition forward. Significant changes to reflect the new exam and licensure structure are underway to the National Candidate Database, plus other NASBA systems and platforms. The new CPA Exam core plus discipline structure also brings additional complexity to the publication format and data to be provided. Quarterly reports will continue to be provided to each Board of Accountancy, and it is anticipated that annual summaries will also be made available. As always, accountancy boards may also continue to reach out to NASBA for additional information on an ad hoc basis. Publications through 2019 remain available on our website, www.nasbareport.com, for interested third parties.

I look forward to working closely with you and your boards as we continue to move through uncharted territory. And I am confident that this time next year, we will feel proud about what we have accomplished to strengthen the regulation of the profession. Two years ago, I never would have imagined being the third chair to lead NASBA through a hybrid year of virtual meetings. My hope is for NASBA to transition back to live meetings next year. I am extremely proud of what the NASBA staff, board members and you, the volunteers, have accomplished during the pandemic to ensure timely, effective communications while working through many important matters such as NOCLAR, CPA Evolution and continuing to ensure that Diversity, Equity and Inclusion remain in our focus. As more than 650,000 licensees throughout the country, and throughout the world, reboot their professional lives under the always changing \"New Normal,\" there are procedures that we must follow in order to protect the public. Likewise, state boards will need to reconsider the crucial elements of operation, in this new and challenging regulatory environment. During my career, I experienced changes in public accounting resulting from the Savings and Loan crisis in the early 80s the implementation of Sarbanes Oxley as a result of Enron and World Com, the creation of the Single Audit act as a result of misuse of government funds, and increased regulation of the DOL over employee benefit plan failures. Recently, there was a Wall Street Journal article about perceived weak oversight of audits of billions of dollars of private assets. Personally, I am not sure that Sarbanes Oxley is the end all to large audit failures. A CPA can do everything according to professional standards and a business may still fail due to fraud or other irregularities. As a profession and the regulators to that profession, we need to be able to adapt to address any criticisms that may come because of possible future failures. We need to ensure that professional quality, whether in performing an audit under PCAOB standards, a private audit, preparing a tax return or any other service, is supported by strong, relevant, professional standards. Next year, I believe the bar will be set even higher due to increased pressure for anti-regulation, enhanced oversight of the SEC and increased scrutiny of inspectors general on single audits, especially as audits of billions of dollars received under various stimulus plans become subject to special audit procedures. In NASBA' s budget for next year, we devoted more funds to mission spending in support of state boards to help you with any of your needs. We all need to work together to address any criticism that may be directed at state board regulation the next time a major audit failure occurs...and to reboot if necessary. And I promise, NASBA will be there to assist you! It is also critical that we continue to look for ways to increase the pipeline of new individuals into the profession. As shared during the Annual Meeting, the number of candidates taking the CPA Exam continues to decline. It is essential to the protection of the public that we, as regulators, look for ways to increase the number of candidates that ultimately become CPAs. As the AICPA continues to work with state societies to demonstrate the value of the CPA license to potential candidates, we all need to look for new ways to encourage non-traditional students to enter the profession. As a matter of fact, AICPA Chair Bill Pirolli attended a community college, and I attended a branch campus of a university. I challenge each of you to explore non-traditional avenues when hiring new employees. There is not one silver bullet that will solve the pipeline issue, but I believe that NASBA, state boards, state societies and the AICPA all working together can bring more talented people into the profession. As we continue to work with other countries to renew or enter into mutual recognition agreements, one common, major hurdle, is the discussion around the experience requirement for individuals signing an audit opinion. Many countries have longer experience requirements than we have in the U.S., particularly for certified accountants performing attest work. We will continue to discuss whether a firm requirement should be considered requiring a CPA to have more experience prior to signing an audit opinion in the U.S. All of us have seen how the world has changed in the past year. As the demographics of the U.S. continue to change, we need to shift our focus to find ways to become more diverse, inclusive and equitable. I have seen the NASBA Board of Directors grow more diverse over my years as a Board member. In fact, the four previous chairs who succeeded me represent that initiative. NASBA' s 2021-22 Board is also one of the most diverse boards I can remember. Before I conclude, I would be remiss if I did not recognize the support and commitment of my wife and best friend, Phyllis, for allowing me to devote the time to serve as chair of this great organization. I would not be able to do what I am doing without her support. In summary, our number one goal is to get back to basics to make sure that quality is evident in every professional service that is delivered to the public. Secondly, we need to all do our part to strengthen the CPA pipeline. Third, is to continue to move towards the implementation of the CPA Evolution so we are ready in 2024. Lastly, we need to keep our eye on the ball and move the needle as it relates to diversity, equity and inclusion. If you will support me in my priorities for this next year, I am positive we will persevere and can adapt to strengthen the profession by enhancing state-based licensing and ultimately do a better job of protecting the public we serve. Thank you, and I look forward to working with you as we persevere through this \"New Normal\" together! \u2014 W . Michael Fritz, CPA Chair 2021-2022Rebooting and Returning to Basics W. Michael Fritz Chair 2021-22 4 NASBA State Board Report /Fall 2021With 39 of the 51 jurisdictions convening in January (Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, and Texas do not have a regular session in even-numbered years), NASBA has already been monitoring pre-filed legislation for 2022. In addition, 26 legislatures work within the framework of a two-year cycle, allowing them to carry over legislation. For example, 78 de-regulation bills monitored by NASBA and filed in 2021 can potentially carry over to 2022 sessions. NASBA, along with ARPL partners, will be monitoring these and any new de-regulation bills filed in 2022, and assisting state partners to defeat or amend legislation as needed. To review legislation of interest to a Board of Accountancy, CLICK HERE. Once on the Legislative Tracking home page, using graphs and maps, plus descriptive text, the page clearly displays not only what issues are being raised in various states directly impacting State Boards of Accountancy, but also spotlights trends in legislation that other professions are encountering. Users can filter bills to focus on specific topics such as: deregulation, marijuana, digital currencies, and tax preparers. tGearing Up for 2022 Sessions Key Person Contact NASBA' s Key Person Contact (KPC) program identifies Board of Accountancy members and executive directors who have personal and/or professional relationships with those serving in state and federal legislatures - along with those serving in the executive branches of state government. These individuals can provide additional backing for the support or opposition of legislation affecting the regulation of the accounting profession and produce a coherent and cohesive network. The KPC program will serves as a nexus for transmitting information to legislators and reporting information about proposed or pending legislation to NASBA.

Her agenda covered many facets of the program, including the environment, Career Path Accelerator elements, program design and the Career Path Accelerator pathway. To begin, Glazerman explained the challenge: affordability and accessibility of the accounting profession for those who want to be CPA-eligible. Her solution is the EY Career Path Accelerator. EY is currently very interested and focused on helping people come through the CPA pipeline with the 150-hour requirement in place. The program is focused on candidates coming to EY without a master' s degree, who seek to acquire the 150-hours in a nontraditional manner. The program contains a number of components, including being affordable (need based financial aid for the program is available through the Ernst & Young Foundation), allowing students to jumpstart their career, offering appropriate and rigorous content, students gaining targeted skills and candidates obtaining credits that are accredited and portable. The EY Career Path Accelerator allows EY interns, who are not pursuing a master' s degree, to earn their additional credit hour requirement for CPA licensure by leveraging EY' s relationship with Hult International Business School. The program does not compete with university accounting programs, as it does not include any accounting hours. In fact, EY emphasizes to candidates that they must get their accounting hours through their undergraduate institution. Rather, the program focuses on targeted skills, the business and elective hours. When a student begins the program, they must sign-up for one of three credit packages. To be eligible, students must have completed or will have completed all accounting course requirements to sit for the Exam, made the decision to not get a master' s degree and are responsible for knowing and obtaining all state requirements to sit for the Exam. Included in the program is learning and assessments, a winter or summer internship and a Capstone project.

It is difficult for me to acknowledge that 12 months have passed since my virtual inauguration last November. I deeply regret that we were deprived of the satisfaction received from attending our Regional and Annual conferences. Let' s face it, Zoom is not, and never will be, a substitute for personal contact. Our theme for 2021 is \"Persevere,\" which describes NASBA' s continued work despite obstacles and discouragement brought on by the pandemic. Regardless of the unfortunate reality, we have all survived the past two years and much has been accomplished as NASBA continues to persevere to fulfill our mission to you, our Boards of Accountancy. CPA Evolution, an initiative which began under my predecessor, Laurie Tish, is still \"front and center\" as a priority for the profession. Although the journey we have been on in partnership with the AICPA, to revamp and modernize our professional licensure model is not over, there have been some positive accomplishments in this area this past year. Last fall, the AICPA and NASBA established four joint task forces comprised of volunteer subject matter experts from the academic community and CPAs from professional practice, business and industry, to develop the CPA Evolution Model Curriculum that the academic community could use as a tool to update their current accounting programs. Their work culminated 6-months later in a launch event hosted this past June by the American Accounting Association, that attracted over 2000 attendees. We continue our joint efforts with the AICPA to inform academic and student communities about forthcoming changes to the Uniform CPA Exam. In fact, surveys were sent out to accounting program chairs, educators, and students to provide important information on our joint efforts as we move toward implementation of a new Exam model in early 2024. Legislatively, 2022 will likely be another busy year for John Johnson, Director of Legislative and Governmental Affairs. During the last legislative session, NASBA identified and tracked some 228 pieces of deregulation bills. We can anticipate five to ten jurisdictions will have some form of deregulation bills filed next year in 2022. In addition, there is rollover legislation from 2021 that will also affect several states. This legislation will adversely affect the CPA profession across all jurisdictions. We will be working hard to ensure this does not happen. Our partnership with the AICPA and other professions to establish the Alliance for Responsible Professional Licensing (ARPL) will continue to ensure our states have the tools necessary to provide talking points, suggested amendments and other research to our state partners to better inform state lawmakers that the CPA profession must and should be viewed and treated differently because we are a technical, licensed and learned profession. We are not an occupation that would warrant wholesale deregulation. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion was one of the key issues I proposed when I became NASBA chair, and it will also be one for my successor, Mike Fritz. During my inaugural address, I shared, \"The challenge that diversity presents is one that begins with a willingness to have a conversation and to understand and accept that there are differences that exist among us, and that these differences should be viewed as tools to strengthen us, not to divide us.\" As our population grows and becomes more diverse, it is extremely important for our profession to reach out and attract qualified women and minorities to become CPAs. Efforts must be made, not only to encourage the study of accounting to a young, more diverse population - adding help to the pipeline - but also to afford opportunities in management and governance, in both private and public sectors. There has been positive movement in the makeup of our state boards to be more inclusive and diverse. I have participated in our regional calls and heard the discussions by our state boards as they tackle diversity and inclusion in their board makeup. I am pleased to hear that the \"conversation\" that I mentioned earlier is happening. Currently, only seven percent of our state boards currently lack women representation, which is a positive step. But it might surprise you to know that over 40% of our boards still have no minority representation, which confirms that more effort is needed in making our state boards reflect the licensees they regulate. I challenge you to consider giving opportunities to those who may be overlooked or marginalized, as their contributions to our profession may surprise you. During my term, I had the pleasure of chairing the Strategic Planning Task Force. Like most well run organizations, a good deep dive into our mission and objectives is necessary to keep NASBA on track and responsive to all our stakeholders. I assembled a very diverse group of 15 individuals, men, women, and persons of color, from all eight NASBA regions to unite and evaluate our current Strategic Plan. The process spanned 7-months, starting in December and concluding this past June. We looked at the guiding mission, vision, and values of our organization, and evaluated our objectives and determined whether they were truly measurable to ensure that the services we provide were purposeful and meaningful for our member boards. The process was tedious and demanded much thought and effort, and no stone was left unturned. The Board adopted this new and improved Strategic Plan at its July Board of Directors meeting. Finally, I want to offer my sincere thanks and appreciation to those of you who unselfishly gave of your time to serve on a NASBA committee or were our representative on a joint committee with the AICPA. Without you, the work that is so important to the profession and to the regulation of our profession could not be possible. To the leadership and staff of NASBA, my heartfelt thanks go to you for everything you do, and for helping me fulfill my role as chair. It is because of you that NASBA remains \"Mission Driven - Member Focused.\" \u2014 A. Carlos Barrera, CPA Chair 2020-2021Onward & Upward as We Persevere! A. Carlos Barrera Chair 2020-21 6 NASBA P .

Harris, Ross and Ley Receive Honors Mark Harris Barbara Ley Randall Ross National Registry eSummit Explores Waves of Change, Oceans of Opportunity Due to the continued COVID-19 pandemic, NASBA' s National Registry Summit was once again an eSummit, held virtually. During the September 2021 event, themed \"Waves of Change, Oceans of Opportunity,\" two keynote speakers touched upon accessibility within educational environments and interaction with learners. Kassy LaBorie, Principal Consultant, Consulting LLC, lead a presentation entitled, \"Interact and Engage!\" LaBorie began her presentation with a humorous video that shared her take-away message: Zoom as you'd be Zoomed to. She shared with eSummit attendees that as a new era in business emerges, now is an opportune time to work on making meetings and trainings better than they have been before. Should you find yourself required to give a lecture, a great way to boost interaction is to challenge participants to write test questions. When sharing the questions, create friendly competition between the author and respondents. To hear more from LaBorie, visit kassyconsulting.com. Additionally, Lainey Feingold spoke to attendees about the Americans with Disabilities Act and learning providers' responsibility to ensure accessible quality education for CPE is being provided. Elizabeth Wolfe, NASBA Regulatory Counsel, also spoke about the updates to rules in the states and jurisdictions. This topic is always of relevance with Registry sponsors. John Pytel, co-founder and chief executive officer of Conferences i/o, presented on the benefits of this learning tool. Discussing the future of CPE technology, Pytel made sure to incorporate Conferences i/o into his brief but well-thought-out presentation. Starting as an engagement tool in 2013 for live events, Conferences i/o evolved into a more robust tool. NASBA has used this tool for its group live requirements for engagement, Q & A and session evaluations. To conclude the eSummit, NASBA Associate Director- National Registry Jessica Luttrull took on the \"Ask NASBA\" segment of the program and answered many questions regarding the Standards. tRandall A.

Brooks, Board's Executive Director, to Retire December 31 Robert N. BrooksAfter more than 35 years with the Board, Robert N. Brooks is retiring on December 31, 2021. In announcing his retirement, Brooks said, \"I've had a good career with the Board. It was never just a job to me.\" Brooks was hired as the Board's Deputy Director on April 1, 1986, and has been the Executive Director since April 1, 1991. Barton W. Baldwin, CPA, President of the Board, has known Brooks for many years. He was president-elect of the NCACPA when Brooks be - came Executive Director. Baldwin says he knew from experi - ence that his young friend would be a leader for accounting professionals in North Carolina. \"Everybody knows who Bob is, and they pay attention when he speaks about regulations or the best places to eat,\" Baldwin explained. \"He has led North Carolina through unimaginable transitions over the past 30 plus years enabling us to proudly claim our place in the top tier of State Boards of Accountancy. I consider myself fortunate to call him my old friend,\" stated Baldwin. David R. Nance, CPA, the Board's Deputy Director, said Brooks has worked to build up the reputation of the Board, and wanted to ensure that the CPA title was highly regarded. Nance said Brooks worked daily to maintain the profession's high stan - dards and didn't shy away from hold - ing people he knew to those high standards. \"He generally started most phone calls or discussions from folks that he knew with 'hey, Bud' before get - ting into the nitty-gritty,\" explained Nance. \"If you had 'CPA' behind your name, you needed to uphold the ex - pectations of being a CPA.\"twice a year to a 16-hour comput - er-based Exam offered year-round. \"Bob's long history and leader - ship in support of the regulation of the CPA profession, expertise and institutional knowledge of the CPA Examination, and insight into the is - sues that strengthen public protec - tion have been crucial to NASBA and State Boards of Accountancy,\" said Ken L. Bishop, President and CEO of NASBA. \"Personally, I will always consider Bob to be a good friend. I congratu - late him for a great career and wish him a wonderful retirement. I am tru - ly going to miss him when he retires,\" he exclaimed. In 2012, Brooks received NASBA's Lorraine P. Sachs Standard of Excellence Award , the award that recognizes state board of accoun - tancy executive directors who \"have shown exemplary, dedicated and outstanding service and commitment to improving the effectiveness of ac - counting regulation, both locally and nationally.\" Brooks continued on page 5 Brooks's dedication to the CPA pro - fession's integrity is evident through his work with state and national or - ganizations such as the NCACPA and NASBA. Much of Brooks' work with NASBA focused on the Uniform CPA Exam. For the past 24 years, Brooks has been a member of the NASBA committee that helped facili - tate the change from a 19.5-hour pa - per-and-pencil Exam administered North Carolina State Board of Certified Public Accountant Examiners 2Disciplinary Actions Pursuant to NCGS 93-12(9), civil penalties are remitted to the North Carolina Civil Penalty and Forfeiture Fund (\"Fund\") in accordance with NCGS 115C-457.2.

The Respondent Firm had undergone peer reviews in the past and its next scheduled peer review was due June 30, 2021. On the Respondent Firm's 2020 annual firm renewal, the Respondent stated that the Respondent Firm issued compilations and audits during 2020. 5. The Board staff received notice that the Respondent Firm had been dropped from the AICPA Peer Review Program as of October 13, 2020. 6. The Board staff attempted on multiple occasions to correspond with the Respondent regarding his re - moval from the peer review program. The Respon - dent was non-responsive to all inquiries sent by the Board staff. 7. The Respondents wish to resolve this matter by consent and agree that the Board staff and coun - sel may discuss this Consent Order with the Board ex parte, whether or not the Board accepts this Con - sent Order as written.

Last month, we answered some of the most frequently asked questions about the general CPE requirement. This month, we're answering questions about the ethics CPE requirement and the CPE requirement for non-resident CPAs. Successful Exam Candidates The following North Carolina candidates passed the Exam in October 2021: Kate Rachel Adams David Jonathan Bell Rebecca Lauren Christensen Keenan Mikle D'Arcy Abby Renee Duggan Anatasha Nicole George Hannah Katelyn Headen Alan Michael Henson Stephen Cooper Herrington Erica Fogg Hunter Lorraine Danasia Johnson Ashley Taylor Kile Rachel Ann Lang Raquelle Yvonne Leblanc Brittany Stanley Lee William David Lewis Cristina Rebecca Louisos Michael Lawrence Lyons Morgan Merrill Kelly Gail Moore James Joseph Morris Nathan Anthony Pacello Alessandro Leonardo Poppante Margaret Prochaska Kaitlyn Edna Quinn Jacob Alan Reese Allie Michelle Richards Julian Erastus Taylor Ryan van der Poll Alex Miguel Vazquez Nathaniel Cole WillsonQ. What is the ethics CPE require - ment? A. As part of the annual CPE re - quirement, licensees must com - plete a minimum of 50 minutes (one hour) in regulatory or be - havioral professional ethics and conduct CPE. Q. Does it matter which ethics course I take? A. Yes. The ethics course must be offered by a sponsor reg - istered with NASBA's Nation - al Registry of CPE Sponsors (NASBAregistry.org/cpas ). Q. My firm offers an in-house ethics course. Can I use that to meet the ethics requirement? A. If the firm is a registered sponsor on NASBA's National Registry of CPE Sponsors, you may use the course to meet the annual ethics requirement. Q. Does the ethics requirement ap - ply to a non-resident NC CPA? A. If you are a non-resident CPA (a North Carolina CPA who neither lives nor works in North Caroli - na), you may satisfy the annual ethics CPE requirement by com - pleting the ethics requirement in the jurisdiction where you are li - censed and work or reside. If you are licensed and live or work in a jurisdiction that doesn't have an ethics CPE requirement, you must comply with the Board's ethics CPE requirement. Q. If I take a 2-hour ethics class, can I use the \"extra\" hour to meet the next year's requirement?A. The one-hour ethics requirement is an annual requirement, so you cannot use \"extra\" ethics CPE credit to skip taking an ethics course next year. However, you may apply the \"ex - tra\" ethics CPE minutes toward the total number of CPE minutes completed this year. Q. What happens if I don't take an ethics class this year? A. If you don't complete the required ethics course this year (2021), you may be ineligible to renew your license for 2022-2023. If you complete the CPE require - ment--including the ethics re - quirement--after December 31, 2021, but before July 1, 2022, you may renew your license, but will receive a Letter of Warning from the Board. But, if this is the second time within 5 calendar years that you don't meet the December 31 deadline, the Board may deny your license renewal. Q. I'm a non-resident NC CPA. Do I need to meet North Carolina's CPE requirement? A. As a non-resident CPA you may satisfy the annual CPE require - ment by completing the require - ment in the jurisdiction where you are licensed and work or reside. If you are licensed and live or work in a jurisdiction that doesn't have a CPE requirement, you must comply with the North Carolina's CPE requirement.

However, before we get to where we are today, it' s important to revisit what has transpired in the past 22 month. During the 2020 Idaho Legislative session, House Bill 318 was passed and signed by Governor Brad Little on March 11, 2020. This bill granted the governor the authority to assign agencies, such as the ISBA, to divisions, sections, or units in a manner to provide an orderly arrangement in the administration of state government. As previously reported, on June 3, 2020, Idaho Governor Brad Little, signed Executive Order 2020-10 which moved ISBA under the newly created Division of Occupational and Professional Licenses (DOPL) which is under the Department of Self-Governing Agencies. The ISBA was among 10 agencies moved to DOPL which included the Board of Dentistry; Board of Medicine; Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors; Board of Nursing; Outfitters and Guides Licensing Board; Board of Pharmacy; Real Estate Commission; Board of Veterinary Medicine; and the Division of Building Safety and its constituent boards. The ISBA is now organized within the Occupational Licenses section of DOPL. Formerly, the Board was an independent self- regulatory board. Part of the advantage of being within DOPL is that it will allow the agency to leverage other areas of the division to accomplish those important duties outside of licensing. For example, as a part of DOPL, we will have the Administration Section to help us with statute and rule changes, performance reports and strategic planning. The finance department will aid the agency with budgeting and the daily paying and receiving tasks. We will also have a group of DOPL investigators who will help us thoroughly examine complaints and work through the Administrative Procedures Act when it comes to discipline. While staff was engaged in these activities, they are the kind of activities that take time and pull one away from the other day to day responsibilities that need to be accomplished, such as interacting and assisting our exam and license candidates, licensees, and firms. I'll talk later about other changes impacting the agency staffing and how we will do business moving forward. In February of 2021, the ISBA physically relocated to our new home on the State of Idaho' s Chinden Campus. The move not only saved the agency money in lease costs, but it also allowed the board to become integrated into the DOPL organization and gave the staff the opportunity to interact daily with staff members from other boards. We used this to begin learning and implementing what other boards do to become more effective. Overall, the move, which seemed daunting at first, has been better than expected. It took a little bit to get used to not having our own conference room and offices, but the pluses far outweigh the minuses. As mentioned in both the last spring newsletter and this edition, staff personnel have undergone some changes as well. At the end of June, Sandy Bly retired after 40+ years with the state of Idaho, 29 of which were with our board. Then, at the end of October, Mary Robinson also retired after working for the board for five years. While they are both missed, we wish them nothing but success in their \"new phase of life.\"FROM THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER Kent Absec Exec. Officer Continued on page 2 Idaho State Board of Accountancy Page 2 Being a part of DOPL exposed employees from all the agencies to other opportunities within the Division. One such opportunity came to Tami Helton. Most of you know Tami as our CPE Coordinator helping many of our licensees navigate through the annual CPE requirements. Tami, using her knowledge and experience in helping handle the revenues and expenses of this agency, applied for, and was offered a position within DOPL' s finance department. It will be a great opportunity for Tami and while she will also be missed, she promises to help where she can during our transition to a new staff model. Part of our new staffing will include the addition of Casey Oare to our licensing team. Casey comes to us from the Investigations area within DOPL. Casey was formerly the Complaint Manager within Investigations and comes to us with a lot of experience in working with the public as she also handled Public Records requests during her time as a part of the former Idaho Bureau of Occupational Licenses (IBOL). Casey' s responsibilities will be in assisting exam and licensure candidates as well as helping licensees and firms, particularly with peer review. The agency will also have the support of a DOPL Licensing Team Lead, Cesley Metcalfe. Cesley has worked with many boards in her nine years with IBOL/ DOPL. With Casey being a part of the Licensing and Registration area within DOPL, she will report to Cesley who will manage a team of licensing specialist across many boards. Cesley is currently ramping up her learning of all things Accountancy. Cesley will report to me as the Executive Officer for the agency. When the ISBA was an independent board, my role was that of an Executive Director or administrator. Now that ISBA is within DOPL and that some of the administrative tasks are being moved to a different area, my role has changed and the ISBA will no longer have a full time dedicated Executive Director. Along with being the Executive Officer for Accountancy, I will also serve in the same role for the Athletic Commission; Driving Business Schools; Morticians; Shorthand Reporters; and the Barbers & Cosmetology Board. Along with my duties as the Executive Officer for these boards, I will also serve as the Licensing & Registration Program Manager for the 16 boards under DOPL' s Occupations Section. While these changes may seem overwhelming, rest assured that our current Board members are still intact and focused on our mission of protecting the public in the most efficient manner possible. The Board, myself, and the entire DOPL staff are excited and committed to providing our stakeholders, such as you, with the best customer experience possible. We know it may take some time to replace the experience we lost with the departure of former staff members, so we ask that you be patient as we work with you moving forward. I am confident that over time, these changes will be advantageous to everyone involved. As always, if you have any questions or comments you'd like to pass on, feel free to reach out to me at either kent.absec@isba.idaho. gov or our general email box of isba@isba.idaho.gov. Kent A. AbsecFROM THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CONTINUED) Change continues to be one of the few constants in our profession and world. With change comes new opportunities. Certainly, we are all aware of the challenges facing our profession considering the impact of COVID, in addition to the regulatory and professional changes coming our way. Today, we have the opportunity to embrace major changes as Idaho licensees; like being absorbed into the Division of Occupational and Professional Licenses (DOPL) and how that feels from a licensee standpoint; CPA Evolution and the resulting incorporation of new or differing professional paths that stem as the result. While the basics are the same, we must admit that the profession continues to evolve and change to meet the needs of our changing world. Case in point: As a CPA who sat for the CPA exam in the late '70' s, I couldn't have even imagined at any point in my early career that one day I would be partnered in a small niche-based firm solely serving veterinarians throughout the United States. How did the needle move to the point that small firms can and do serve a single market or focus? Sometimes change is slow and subtle, while sometimes it is fast and furious! Either way, today, it is almost impossible to escape hearing or reading about a reference to the transformation of our industry and craft. How exciting! Just as constant change surrounds us, we must embrace change and look for new ways to support and maintain the relevancy of the profession. Therein lies our number one challenge and opportunity. It' s hard to believe that I have served the last four years on the Idaho State Board of Accountancy. As the newly elected Chairman of the Board, I was asked to introduce myself. I am both honored and excited to serve as such in this, my fifth and final year on the board. And this year is already shaping up to be just as exciting as the last, considering the many changes to the board and profession coming our way. Fortunately, the board is made up of committed volunteers dedicated and poised to meet the needs and challenges facing us all. Finally, I would like to personally thank Kent Absec, Executive Officer (EO), for his many years of service. Standing along every effective EO are team members who truly get things done. Thank you, Sandy Bly (recently retired), Tami Helton, and Mary Robinson (recently retired) for your dedication and amazing contributions. In closing, I strongly encourage you to embrace new ideas, new ways of practicing in this profession we each selected as our own. Continue supporting our profession. Your professional membership support, your ideas and suggestions, and your willingness to volunteer for an industry board or committee can and do make a difference. Challenge yourself by learning something totally unrelated to your area of expertise. Challenge yourself by considering new and different ways of approaching your knowledge specialty. Dare to change, for the better of yourself and for the profession. Jimmy Bell, CPAMESSAGE FROM THE BOARD CHAIR Time Flies When Your Are Having Fun! Idaho State Board of Accountancy Page 3 Fall is upon us and as we finish out the year, it is amazing to look back on all that has changed in 2021. One of the positive changes for the profession that has come out of the pandemic is that CPE courses, which were previously only offered in-person, are now available virtually. Although we may obtain all our CPE credits virtually or through self-study, the program sponsor must follow the 2016 NASBA/AICPA Statement of Standards for CPE. This requirement did not change during the pandemic, so please make sure that any CPE you claim meets the requirements As a reminder, you can view the Standards at: https://www.nasbaregistry.org/__media/Documents/ Others/Statement_on_Standards_for_CPE_Programs-2016.pdf . As you look at CPE needs, remember that all certificates must be obtained and dated on or before December 31, 2021. On the CPE Committee, we oftentimes see certificates for programs that are dated January 1, 20XX or later. The certificates with dates after December 31, 2021, cannot be counted for 2021 CPE requirements. So, make sure to take any quizzes, exams, or other requirements to submit timely to obtain a properly dated certificate.

Each year, the Board selects 10% of those licensees for a review of CPE credits during the Spring audit. Those selected are required to submit certificates corresponding to the list of credits submitted during renewal. Board staff has completed the review of submissions for the 2021 CPE audit. For the second year running, we have had a 100% response rate. Of the 547 CPAs chosen for the audit, only eleven (or 2%) were found to be non-compliant with CPE requirements. This is a great improvement over the 2019 audit, which found nearly 11% of CPAs to be out of compliance. Getting the necessary training prepares you for changes to standards and regulations. You are a member of an esteemed profession\u2014maintaining your continuing education is crucial to providing quality services to your clients.

This is changing how business is conducted within the profession and with what parties those within the profession interact and engage with on a daily basis. As a result, non-accounting graduates make up about 31% of all new graduate hires in public accounting \u2014 an increase of 11% from 2016 to 2018. Technological innovation is impacting the profession and creating new marketplace demands. These innovations are creating new opportunities for CPAs, both in terms of the types of services they perform and in how those services are delivered. Accounting graduates and newly licensed CPAs must have the skills and expertise to support the growing technology demands. A growing percentage of large-firm mergers involve non- CPA firms. The technologies discussed previously have impacted revenue generation of traditional compliance- based accounting services. Firms are expanding their services to incorporate niche areas such as cyber security, human resources, IT, wealth management, litigation support and more. This is creating new opportunities for CPAs, both in terms of the types of services they perform and in how those services are delivered. All of these emerging technologies are creating new marketplace demands and opportunities for the accountancy profession. This means new skills are needed by those in the profession to continue to serve organizations and the public.One of the ways the profession seeks to address this trend is through the CPA Evolution project. This project strives to ensure that CPAs can support an accounting profession that plays a critical role in protecting the public interest. CPA Evolution is a combined NASBA- AICPA initiative aimed at evolving CPA licensure to reflect the skills and knowledge CPAs increasingly need in a technology-driven marketplace. The new model will: Maintain a strong core with accounting, auditing, tax, and technology Ensure a deeper knowledge in three primary disciplines Enhance public protection Reflect reality of practice, with adaptability to the changing needs of the profession Visit the CPA Evolution website for more information about the new CPA Licensure Model, resources for accounting educators, and more.CPA EVOLUTION New CPA Skills Business intelligence Information security governance Cybersecurity risk management Data management Data analysis and reporting IT audit; risks and controls System and Organization ControlsWhat to Look For Fall 2021: Candidate transition policy announced July 2022: Exam Blueprint exposed for public comment January 2023: Exam Blueprint finalized January 2024: New Exam Launches Tennessee Department of Commerce & Insurance Tennessee Board of Accountancy | 500 James Robertson Parkway | Nashville, 615-741-2550 | Fax: 615-532-8800 | tn.gov/commerce/regboards/accountancy License # Agnew, Mary 28430 Ahuja, Fatehdeep Singh 28382 Allen, Cary 28106 Allen, 28371 Anderson, Zachary Ryan 28183 Austin, Margaret 28381 Bacon, David Foster Iii 28157 Bacon, Turner Joshua 28323 Bailey, Rebecca Carole 28247 Baker, Lindsey 28318 Ballitch, Molly 28272 Bargeron, Lia Melissa Jean 28439 Barnett, Braydon Richmond 28139 Bartlett, Emily Michelle 28238 Bass, Michael Christian 28257 Batta, Alexander Nicholas 28168 Baxter, Daniel Dean 28200 Bay, Kevin Anthony 28281 Belcher, Andrew Charles 28243 28304 28123 Briscoe, Ryan 28199 Campbell, 28352 Cao, Ni 28241 Carico, Stephen Bruce 28294 Carlson, Cathy 28358 Carpenter, Wilkinson Jr 28330 Carruth, Chandler 28413 Carter T. 28350 Clayton, Taylor 28126 Cleary, Ryan 28329 28346 28127 Collico, Connolly, Kalen Hope 28153 Cook, Thomas 28263 Cox, 28379 Crafton, Davis, Melissa Sue 28118 Dawson, Sio, Michael 28254 Deakins, Anne 28438 Dunlap, Dunn, Anthony Ryan 28424 Elshahat, Islam 28141 Evans, Ali 28332 Evans, Taylor Duncan 28293 Fall, James A Iii 28333 Faughnan, Caitlin 28161 Fickle, William James Holly Nicole 28289 Freeland, George Jon 28291 Gibler, Tyler 28190 Goodhue, 28305 Hamm, Charles 28166 Hannon, Jordan 28279 Harper, William Andrew 28427 Harris, Charles Blaine 28437 Harter, Seth 28179 Hodges, Ashli Symone 28356 Horton, Robert Chase 28096 Howard, Ethan Lawrence 28242 Hsiao, Nathan 28189 Huber, Hudson 28194 Hughes, Stephanie Jenkins, Kayla Michelle 28149 Johnson, Harper 28313 Johnson, Lindsey Erin Gross 28280 Johnson, Lynn Maree 28164 Jones, Cara 28186 Jones, Lincoln Jordan, Cameran 28108Kendzorski, David 28309 King, Taylor 28436 Jacob Lavin, 28102 Lile, Linde, Morgan, Nathan 28392 Morris, Benjamin H 28277 Moss, Dashanique E.

The Tennessee Board has two avenues to bring a CPA license back to Active status, depending on the current license status. A license in Closed, Inactive, or Retired status may be reactivated. Licenses that have expired, and those that were revoked or suspended, must be reinstated. These applications are available through your account at core.tn.gov. Reactivation requires 80 hours of CPE in technical subjects, earned in the 24 months immediately preceding the application date, including at least two hours of board approved Tennessee State Ethics. If earned in the appropriate years, the CPE may be used again for license renewal. Reinstatement of an expired license requires 80 hours of CPE in technical subjects, earned in the 6 months immediately preceding the application date, including at least two hours of board approved Tennessee State Ethics. This is penalty CPE that cannot be applied to any other purpose. Reinstating a revoked or suspended CPA license requires review and approval by the Board as outlined in Accountancy Rule 0020-01-.10. The Board may impose CPE and/or other requirements. Contact Information Mailing Address: State Board of Accountancy 500 Status Requirements Inactive/Retired 80 CPE hours in 24 months Closed 80 CPE hours in 24 months; $110.00 Expired 80 Penalty in 6 months; $250.00 Revoked/Suspended Board appearance; $250.00 A recent rule amendment adds language to the Continuing Education portion of the Board's rules regarding State-Specific Ethics CPE. Effective October 6, 2021, all renewing CPAs with a CPE requirement must earn the two credit hours in State-Specific Ethics (SSE). First-time renewers with a shortened CPE requirement were previously exempt from this requirement. Two credit hours in SSE is now also required for those reactivating an Inactive or Closed license, and those reinstating an Expired license.

Unfortunately, new variants continue to emerge and that return remains elusive. With the pandemic continuing into the new year, business uncertainty remains and Board licensees and stakeholders continue to experience anxiety and concern. To that end, please know that Board staff will continue to look for ways to improve services, and while we are still bound by Governor Inslee's re-entry guidelines, we have flexibility to schedule in-office meetings, if appropriate. To aid in your respective planning processes, here are two items that the Board will be working through in 2022. Peer Review: The AICPA's Peer Review program was established many years ago for the purpose of improving the quality of accounting, auditing, and attestation services performed by CPAs. In our state, this program is administered by the Washington Society of CPAs (WSCPA) and the Board participates via our sanctioned Peer Review Oversight Committee which includes Board Members and volunteer Board Representatives. Due to upcoming changes envisioned, the Society will no longer be our state's administering entity and is looking at other states and their models for a solution; the Board will be an active participant in this search for a solution because it impacts Washington State licensees. This topic was briefly discussed at the October 2021 Annual Board meeting and will be a topic of future Board meetings. In other peer review program news, the AICPA will be holding a Peer Reviewer Forum on December 13, 2021 from 11am-12pm (EST), and the AICPA Peer Review Board approved an exposure draft of the proposed clarified peer review standards and is requesting comments on the proposed changes be submitted by December 15, 2021. CPA-Inactive Certificate Holders: The WSCPA will propose legislation to change RCW 18.04 relative to those holding CPA- Inactive certificates issued by the Board. The change is to promote clarity, reduce confusion in accounting titles, and benefit licensees. This provides the opportunity for another status to those CPAs that are not ready to retire their license. This also aligns our terminology and licensure status with other state and territory boards of accountancy. Board staff are supportive of this proposal. This will be a topic of the next Board meeting. Proposed language is expected to be introduced for the 2022 Legislative session. It has been a challenging year for you, working under pandemic conditions and learning a new Board licensing system. Thank you for the work you do for the citizens of Washington and being a Board licensee. I wish you all the best in 2022.

Please send your suggestions to customerservice@acb.wa.gov . It's that time of year again for over 8,000 of you - CPAs, CPA firms, non- licensee firm owners, and CPA-inactive certificate holders alike. Renewal reminders will be sent at the beginning of January by email and mail. Keep in mind that if your contact information is not up-to-date, you may not receive your reminders even if it is your renewal year. If you are unsure, check the licensee search for your expiration date. Dates and Fees -- If 2022 is your renewal year, online applications can be submitted starting January 1 and by April 30, to avoid the late fee. Renewal applications submitted between May 1 and June 30 will be assessed a $100 late fee. The renewal application fee is $230. CPA firms will have additional fees if making firm changes or if participating in peer review. We suggest you submit your application early. April is generally your busiest time of year, as well as ours. CPE Reporting Compliance -- CPE reminders were sent in October, and you were notified that logging your completed CPE into the CPE Tracker is now required for renewals. The CPE Tracker is available through your Secure Access Washington (SAW) account on your Board of Accountancy service dashboard. This is also where you will submit your renewal application once your CPE has been logged. You must log enough completed CPE to show that you have met your renewal requirement before the application will allow you to move forward. The CPE Tracker documentation (CPE course completion certificates, etc.) upload feature is optional. Uploading your CPE documentation is only required when you are requesting a CPE extension or you are notified that you have been selected for the CPE audit. CPE Extension Requests -- If you did not complete your CPE requirements by December 31, 2021, but will be able to complete them by your expiration date, you may request a CPE extension on your renewal application. For licensees who did not meet the 20-hour minimum annual requirement in 2020 or 2021, you will need to request a CPE extension. You can complete the missed hours in another year of your CPE reporting period or by June 30, 2022. Instructions for requesting a CPE extension can be found on our website (https://acb.wa.gov) on the \"Not Enough CPE to Renew\" page. We are here to help with any questions you may have. You can email us at: customerservice@acb.wa.gov . Happy holidays! WHEN THE BOARD RECEIVES A COMPLAINT... The Board handles complaints received against CPAs in Washington State. Our first step involves sending the CPA a copy of the complaint received and requiring a response. This initial letter to the CPA is an opportunity to provide a response, any documentation, and opens the lines of communication. It is crucial to respond and to stay in contact; failure to respond may result in the Board proceeding without the CPA's input or documentation, and is also a violation of Board rule. Throughout the process, we are available to assist with questions about the process. Please reach out to us at any time at investigations@acb.wa.gov . However, we cannot offer legal advice, referrals, or recommendations. We also cannot provide timelines or expectations for the outcome of a complaint. Once concluded, every complaint is formally closed by a letter in writing to the complainant and the CPA. TIME TO RENEW! 2 BOARD MEMBER RECRUITMENT We are looking to fill two vacancies on the Board of Accountancy. One position needs to be filled by Certified Public Accountants (CPA). In order to be eligible to serve in that position, you must be a resident of Washington and have been licensed continuously in this state for the previous ten years. If you have an interest, we want to hear from you. The second position is for a public member. This is a great opportunity for a non-CPA to join the Board and have a voice in the accounting profession. You must be qualified to determine whether the qualifications, activities, and professional practice of those regulated under the Public Accountancy Act conform with standards to protect the public interest. If you know of someone who may have an interest, please let them know of this opportunity. The mission of the Board is to promote the dependability of information that is used for guidance in financial transactions. Service on the Board is service to the people of the State of Washington and to our profession. If appointed, you would be expected to participate at Board meetings, which are held on a quarterly basis at various locations throughout the state. (Currently the Board meetings are being held virtually until it is safe to return to physical locations.) Board members provide input on changes to the laws and regulations that affect the practice of public accounting in our state, and are expected to act in an adjudicative capacity in disciplinary actions when individual CPAs or firms have violated the Public Accountancy Act, RCW 18.04, or related Rules WAC 4-30. While in service to the Board, you will be governed by the Ethics in Public Service Act, RCW 42.52. If selected, you will receive an orientation and training on your role as a Board member. Travel costs are reimbursed for Board meetings or other events in which you may be expected to participate. If you are interested in serving on the Board, you may contact Dave Trujillo, CPA, Executive Director, at (360) 664-9268 or dave.trujillo@acb.wa.gov . You may also submit an application directly to the Governor's Office .2022 BO ARD MEETING SCHEDULE 3Board meetings are open to the public, and your participation is valued and encouraged. We post the meeting agendas to the website approximately two weeks prior to a scheduled meeting. You are able to provide your thoughts on any agenda item; plus you have the opportunity to speak on any topic during the public input section at the end of the meeting. Due to the COVID-19 virus all meetings have been scheduled to be held virtually. Meetings will be changed to physical locations when it is safe to do so. We will post information on accessing the meetings on our website at www.acb.wa.gov as each meeting date approaches. January 28, 2022 Microsoft Teams Meeting April 29, 2022 Microsoft Teams Meeting July 29, 2022 Microsoft Teams Meeting October 28, 2022 Microsoft Teams Meeting All meetings start promptly at 9:00 a.m. Hope to virtually see you there!HELPFUL HINTS - CPE REPORTING Using the CPE Tracker is now mandatory for each renewal period. These helpful tips will make the process run more smoothly for you. l Enter your CPE throughout your CPE reporting period - don't wait until you are completing your renewal application to enter all of your CPE. l Enter longer courses first, if you complete more than the required 120 hours. You only have to enter your Washington State Board approved ethics course plus another 116 hours. l Keep in mind your 20-hour minimum annual CPE requirement. l Upload of CPE course completion certificates is only required if you are requesting a CPE Extension or if you are notified that you have been selected for the CPE audit. l Have all of your CPE course information handy when you sit down to enter it. The CPE Tracker requires the input of all fields before you can add the course and continue to the next course. And last but not least: l Remember the user name and password for your Secure Access Washington (SAW) account registered with the Board. Creating a new SAW account each time you enter CPE becomes very time consuming. Real Time CPE Audits (RTCA) The requirement to do 100% CPE reporting in your CPE Tracker will provide a unique opportunity for the Board to begin Real Time CPE Audits (RTCA). What does RTCA mean for you? If you are selected for the RTCA, you will receive notification within 30 days of submitting your renewal application, rather than months later. What will you need to do if you are selected for the RTCA? As noted in your October CPE Reminder Notice: If you have uploaded your certificates of completion to your CPE Tracker, you will have no action needed when you get the audit notice. If you have not uploaded your certificates, you will be asked to do so within 30 days of notice of audit selection. Notifications will come from cpe@acb.wa.gov . Please add this email address to your safe list. FOLLOW UP AUDIT- 2019 Extension Request, Pre-lapsed Reinstatement, or Enforcement Action Item In 2019, did you have an Extension Request, Pre-lapsed Reinstatement, or Enforcement action item stating you would be added to the next CPE audit? This is your year! Please do not submit your renewal application without all of your CPE documentation uploaded to your CPE tracker. Your application for renewal will not be approved until you have passed the CPE audit.CPE RECIPROCITY Washington State CPA licensees who do not reside in Washington may qualify for CPE reciprocity. To qualify you must: l Be a resident of one of the 55 U.S. jurisdictions l Hold an active license in the jurisdiction in which you reside and is your principal place of business l Meet the CPE requirements for license renewal in your residency jurisdiction (if that jurisdiction has no CPE requirements, the CPE requirements for Washington must be met) If this is you, you do not need to log your completed CPE into the CPE Tracker for your renewal with us. Questions related to CPE reciprocity are built into the renewal application, so you will claim CPE reciprocity when you submit your renewal. Please see WAC 4-30-134(7) for the full Board Rule. Do I have to use the CPE Tracker to report my CPE? Yes, 100% CPE reporting is now required. You must log enough completed CPE to show that you have met your renewal requirement. The CPE Tracker documentation upload feature is optional. Uploading your CPE documentation is only required when you are requesting a CPE extension or you are notified that you have been selected for the CPE audit. 41 UPDATE Fall 2021\u2014Issue No. 94 As we come to the dawn of a new year, I am excited to step back into the role of President of the California Board of Accountancy (CBA). I appreciate my colleagues for entrusting me with this position and will use my time as President to work for the consumers of California to meet the CBA 's consumer protection mission. Sharing in the Board leadership with me will be our newly elected Vice-President Mark J. Silverman, Esq., and Secretary/Treasurer Katrina L. Salazar, CPA. I would also like to thank our immediate past President Nancy J. Corrigan, CPA, for her two years of dedicated service and leadership. Heading into 2022, the CBA has many priorities to focus on. Some of the important areas include forming a Task Force to study the attest experience and general accounting experience requirements for CPA licensure, and guiding the CBA through the next phases of its Business Modernization Project.Michael M. Savoy, CPA President Continued on Page 2 MISSION &VISIONAnother priority on the 2022 agenda will be preparing for the upcoming sunset review, as the CBA 's sunset date is January 1, 2024. Each Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) regulatory board and bureau is required to undergo this legislative review every four years. The name sunset review originates from the fact that the law which requires these reviews stipulates an expiration date, so the Board's authority would \"sunset\" if the Legislature and Governor fail to enact a bill that would reauthorize the CBA. The CBA will assemble its sunset report containing information related to its licensing, enforcement, and related functions and present it to the Legislature late in 2022, allowing time to evaluate it and hold a hearing with the CBA during 2023. You can hear more about our priorities for the upcoming year in a soon-to-be-posted CBA podcast. Yes, the CBA is entering the world of podcasting, and I will be the guest on the inaugural episode, which will be posted to the CBA website in December. There is more information about this CBA podcast series on page 8 of this issue of UPDATE. Message From the President To protect consumers by ensuring only qualified licensees practice public accountancy in accordance with established professional standards. All consumers are well-informed and receive quality accounting services from licensees they can trust.

I would like to extend my gratitude to my fellow Board members for their hard work serving the consumers of California during this time. To the CBA staff: It has been a pleasure working with all of you as well; your dedication really shows, which is a benefit to the public you are tasked with protecting.

At the November CBA Meeting, members elected their new officers for the upcoming year. I wish to congratulate those who will guide the CBA into 2022: CBA President Michael M. Savoy, CPA; Vice-President Mark J. Silverman, Esq.; and Secretary/Treasurer Katrina L. Salazar, CPA. While much of the past two years was affected by the pandemic, due to the resilience of the entire CBA organization, we were still able to accomplish many things to improve the way we serve our consumers, applicants, and licensees. Our Business Modernization Project continued, introducing a new online application in 2021 with many more exciting enhancements on the horizon. A spotlight was shined on preventing elder financial abuse with an article in UPDATE 93 , and a new webpage was created on the CBA website with resources on how to prevent and report such abuse. Our outreach efforts increased with the ability to conduct events virtually, with the CBA reaching more than 600 potential future CPAs during our various events in 2021 . I would also like to thank those serving on the three CBA Advisory Committees: the Enforcement Advisory Committee, the Peer Review Oversight Committee, and the Qualifications Committee. Your assistance is very much appreciated and is an important facet of the CBA fulfilling its consumer-protection mission. There are still vacancies on two committees, so as someone who has learned firsthand how rewarding volunteering on these committees can be, I encourage you to seriously consider applying to fill one of these empty chairs. You can find more information under the \" Opportunities to Serve \" quick link on the CBA website. I wish you all the best as we head into the new year. Nancy J.

Patti Bowers Executive Officer Message From the Executive Officer As the year comes to a close, I would like to thank former President Nancy J. Corrigan, CPA, for two years of outstanding leadership, much of which occurred during the unprecedented COVID-19 years. I also welcome Michael M. Savoy, CPA, back to the president's role, and am excited to work with him as he guides the California Board of Accountancy (CBA) in 2022. It is also a good time to reflect back on what the CBA achieved during 2021 . This wouldn't have been possible without a dedicated group of CBA members and staff striving to fulfill our mission of consumer protection. It's a pleasure to work alongside them all. Let me begin by highlighting two of this year's achievements: Online Application for CPA Licensure\u2014Launchedin April, this online portal benefits our licensingapplicants by streamlining all aspects of theapplication process into one user-friendly onlineexperience. Applicants are now able to fill out theapplication, submit payment by credit card, andupload necessary documents entirely on the CBAwebsite. After submission, applicants have accessto a personal dashboard where they can track theprogress of their application. This all amounts to asubstantial upgrade for our licensing applicants. Assembly Bill 298\u2014The passage of this CBA-sponsored legislation in September will makea difference for our examination applicants by Patti Bowers Executive Officer 4 California Board of Accountancy Newsletter CPA Evolution-A Model for the Future The CPA Evolution initiative is a joint effort of the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) and the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) aimed to transform the CPA licensure model in recognition of the rapidly changing skills and competencies the practice requires today, and will require in the future. The Uniform CPA Examination (CPA Exam) will be undergoing changes as part of the CPA Evolution licensure model, and all candidates will be required to pass three core exam sections covering: Financial Accounting and Reporting (CORE FAR) Auditing and Attestation (CORE AUD) Taxation and R egulation (CORE REG) Eac h candidate will also choose one of these disciplines as their area of interest to demonstrate greater knowledge and skills: Business Analysis and Reporting (BAR) Information Systems and Controls (ISC) Tax Compliance and Planning (TCP) Technology concepts will be incorporated within all core and discipline sections. Regardless of a candidate's chosen discipline, the CPA Evolution model leads to CPA licensure, with rights, privileges, and responsibilities consistent with the present CPA license.CBA-Sponsored Legislation Benefitting Exam Applicants Signed At the 2021 NASBA Regional Meeting, the AICPA unveiled the initial draft content for each of the proposed core and discipline sections of the 2024 CPA Exam. The announcement was followed by the distribution of the practice analysis survey background to all state boards of accountancy, state societies, accounting firms, business and industry, and academia to provide the opportunity to identify concerns with the draft core and discipline CPA Exam sections, prior to a full exposure draft in July 2022. It is anticipated the 2024 CPA Exam details and blueprints will be announced in January 2023. NASBA and the AICPA recently announced details of a transition period to ensure candidates retain credit for CPA Exam sections passed prior to January 2024, when the new CPA Evolution model is implemented. Previous section(s) credited will migrate in January 2024 as: Auditing and Attestation (AUD) will count for CORE AUD Financial Accounting and Reporting (FAR) will count f or CORE F AR Regulation (REG) will count f or CORE REG T o ensure candidates retain credit for a previous Business and Environment (BEC) section passed at the time the new CPA Evolution model is implemented, the BEC can be used to satisfy the discipline requirement. A previously passed BEC section will be counted toward the new disciplines as either BAR, ISC, or TCP . For more information on CPA Evolution, please visit www .evolutionofcpa.org.The California Board of Accountancy (CBA) is pleased to announce the passage of its sponsored legislation for this year. Assembly Bill (AB) 298 (Chapter 300 of the Statutes of 2021) was introduced on the CBA 's behalf by Assembly Member Jacqui Irwin. The bill was introduced in March 2021, and initially sought to address three issues. The largest change was to enable applicants to apply for the Uniform CPA Examination (CPA Exam) 180 days before they complete the educational requirements typically required for the CPA Exam. Two other areas of change clarify existing statute. In one change, the bill provides statutory authority for all elected officers to preside over CBA meetings. The other stipulates that email addresses provided to the CBA by applicants and licensees are deemed to be protected from disclosure under the Public Records Act.After working with stakeholders, including the California Society of CPAs, a fourth element of the bill was included, the ethics education requirements were expanded and now include \"auditing\" and \"fraud\" courses. This change continues to uphold the strong ethics education requirements for California CPA licensure. AB 298 takes effect January 1, 2022.For updates on all bills on which the CBA took a position this legislative session, please visit the CBA website, and under the \"Quick Hits\" section, click \"Laws and Rules, \" and then select \"Pending Legislation. \" To learn more about bills introduced in the California Legislature, please visit www.leginfo.legislature.ca.gov. UPDATE\u2014Fall 2021 5 2020-21 CBA Annual Report Completed At the start of each new fiscal year, the California Board of Accountancy (CBA) reflects back and reports upon the prior fiscal year in two publications. The CBA produces its own Annual Report, and also provides a submission for the Department of Consumer Affairs' (DCA) Annual Report. The CBA Annual Report provides an in-depth overview of each division's operations and achievements, as well as solutions that are underway to enhance and improve CBA 's commitment to California consumers. Some of the highlights include showing how the CBA 's Business Modernization Project, website improvements, and legislation affecting the regulation of the accounting profession in California worked toward meeting the goals established in the 2019-21 CBA Strategic Plan. The 2020-21 CBA Annual Report can be viewed by clicking the \"CBA Reports\" link under the \"Communications & Outreach\" tab on the CBA website. The CBA hopes you agree that these achievements are a testament to its dedication to protecting consumers and providing outstanding service to stakeholders, despite the challenges brought on by the global pandemic the past fiscal year. In the DCA Annual Report, each DCA board and bureau notes its accomplishments and new laws or regulations extending through the 2020 calendar year. The 2020-21 DCA Annual Report is in progress and will be posted under the \"Annual Reports\" link under the \"Publications\" tab on the DCA website.Email Collection Reminder Are you one of the 22,000 licensees who registered and verified their email address on the CBA website? If so, thank you! If not, this is a reminder that licensees are required to provide the CBA with a current, valid email address. Not only is submitting your email required, it also ensures you get information in a more timely fashion from the CBA. However, with over 110,000 licensees (this requirement also applies to partnerships, firms, and corporations), many email addresses still have not been registered. If you received your initial CPA license in 2020 or later, then the CBA has your email address and this does not apply to you. But if you have been licensed since 2019 or before, you do need to register your email address with the CBA. The good news is the process is very simple, and shouldn't take longer than 60 seconds! Just click on the email registration link on the front page of the CBA website, and enter your license number along with the unique PIN you were mailed in early 2020. If you can't locate your PIN, there's an easy way to request a new one right on the same page. If you change your email address at any point, you will need to update it with the CBA. You can do this by filling out a Change of Address Form and emailing it back to the address listed on the form. So, if you still haven't registered or verified your email address, the CBA asks that you would take a brief moment to do it. How about right now? 6 California Board of Accountancy Newsletter Under the Dome The first year of the 2021-2022 California legislative session concluded in September. Throughout each year, the California Board of Accountancy (CBA) engages the Legislature on bills that may impact its consumer protection mission. Here are some bills the CBA has been following this year, and currently adopted CBA positions on that legislation. Assembly Bill 29 (Cooper) CBA Position: Watch Outcome: Assembly Appropriations Committee (Two-Year Bill) Summary: This bill would require that any public meeting notice issued pursuant to the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act must also include all writings or materials in connection with a matter subject to discussion or consideration at that meeting.

AB 105 requires the State Personnel Board to prescribe, and the Department of Human Resources (CalHR) to oversee, compliance with a merit-based civil service system to govern appointments, classifications, examinations, probationary periods, and disciplinary actions. The bill authorizes CalHR to 1) conduct audits and investigations of personnel practices and 2) investigate complaints filed by employees in a state department's Equal Employment Opportunity Program. On July 15, the bill was amended to require hiring oral examinations to be video or otherwise electronically recorded, and that such recordings be maintained for three years. AB 105 also requires CalHR to develop model upward mobility goals by July 1, 2022. Assembly Bill 107 (Salas) CBA Position: Support Outcome: Signed by Governor (Chapter 693 of 2021) Summary: This bill would require a Board within the Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) to, after appropriate investigation, issue a temporary license to practice a profession to an applicant who meets the following requirements: 1) is married to, in a domestic partnership or other legal union with, an active duty member of the United States (U.S.) armed forces assigned to a duty station in California, and 2) has a current, active, and unrestricted license to practice their profession in another U.S. jurisdiction.

Assembly Bill 298 (Irwin) CBA Position: Sponsor Outcome: Signed by Governor (Chapter 300 of 2021) Summary: This bill allows applicants to sit for the Uniform CPA Examination if they are within 180 days of completing the educational requirements; updates ethics education requirements; authorizes the CBA Secretary/Treasurer or another CBA member, as specified, to preside over CBA meetings; and clarifies existing provisions of the Accountancy Act related to the privacy of applicant and licensee email addresses.

The bill would define teleconferencing as participation in a meeting both audibly and visually. Under provisions of the bill, members of a state body participating remotely would count towards a quorum and would only require public disclosure of the designated primary physical meeting location from which the public may participate. Assembly Bill 1026 (Smith) CBA Position: Support Outcome: Assembly Appropriations Committee (Two-Year Bill) Summary: This bill would require DCA, and any of its boards, to grant a 50% fee reduction for an initial license to an applicant who provides satisfactory evidence that they have served as an active duty member of the U.S. armed forces or the California National Guard and was honorably discharged.

It would make an arrest for a felony, where there is no indication that the criminal proceeding has been initiated at least three years after the arrest, eligible for relief. It amends existing law to provide that if the arrest was for a jail or prison felony with a sentence of eight or more years, the record of that arrest shall be eligible for relief when no criminal proceedings have happened six years after the arrest. It would make all felonies eligible for relief, not just jail felonies, and provides that if the defendant was on mandatory supervision, the parole officer shall notify the prosecuting attorney when a petition is filed.

UPDATE\u2014Fall 2021 9 CBA Committee Openings Did you know the California Board of Accountancy (CBA) is aided by three advisory committees made up of licensees dedicated to making a positive contribution to the accounting profession? Did you also know these advisory committees have immediate openings the CBA is actively recruiting to fill? The Enforcement Advisory Committee (EAC), Peer Review Oversight Committee (PROC), and Qualifications Committee (QC) all play important roles within the CBA, offering valuable assistance in many facets of its operations. If you are actively licensed to practice public accounting (and have been for at least two years), and have no pending enforcement actions against your license, then the CBA encourages you to consider stepping into one of these positions. The CBA is seeking candidates motivated by the desire to share their expertise and give back to the accounting profession in California by helping with its oversight. The following is an overview of the function of each advisory committee: The EAC assists the CBA Executive Officer andEnforcement Program on investigations by offeringtechnical guidance on open investigations, participatesin investigative hearings, and reviews closedinvestigations. The EAC is limited to 13 licensees.The PROC assists the CBA in its oversight of the PeerReview Program by evaluating the effectiveness ofmandatory peer review, and ensuring that peer reviewproviders administer reviews in accordance with CBAstandards. The PROC is limited to seven licensees. The QC reviews the experience of applicants forlicensure and makes recommendations to the CBALicensing Program. QC members meet with applicants,employers, or both, and conduct work paper reviews toverify that the responses provided on the certificate ofexperience are reflective of the experience required forlicensure. This committee is comprised of 13 CPAs whohave expertise in the preparation of audit and reviewreports. Committee members are appointed to two-year terms, with four to six meetings held per year. A $100 per diem is provided to members for each meeting. If you or a fellow CPA are qualified and interested in serving on a committee, please submit a letter of interest with a resume or curriculum vitae, including your CPA license number, to Executive Officer Patti Bowers at patti.bowers@cba.ca.gov or by mail at: Patti Bowers\u2014Executive Officer California Board of Accountancy 2450 Venture Oaks Way, Suite 300 Sacramento, CA 95833-3291 10 California Board of Accountancy Newsletter License Renewal as Easy as 1-2-3 It only comes around every two years, but many licensees still dread license renewal time.

UPDATE\u2014Fall 2021 11 How to Change Your Address or Name With the CBA Do you need to report a change to your personal information on file with the CBA? If the information that you put on your application changed during the year, you must report it. The CBA uses your address of record to contact you with important documentation related to license renewal, changes in the law, and other important updates. To ensure that you continue to receive communication from the CBA, whenever your address of record on file with the CBA changes, you are required to provide your new address to the CBA within 30 days of that change. If your name has changed, you must provide copies of supporting documents (i.e., a marriage certificate, court order naturalization, etc.) to the CBA in order to facilitate the update. Both the address and name change forms can be found on the CBA website under the \"Licensee\" tab. The change of address form is also located on the second-to-last page of this UPDATE newsletter. The form and supporting documents can be submitted by email to adminunit@cba.ca.gov; by mail to California Board of Accountancy, 2450 Venture Oaks Way, Suite 300, Sacramento, CA 95833; or via fax to (916) 263-3675. It is recommended that all licensed individuals and firms also keep their phone number up to date with the Board. Beware of Scams The California Board of Accountancy (CBA) is aware of incidents where individuals impersonating members of boards under the Department of Consumer Affairs umbrella contacted licensees with the intent of defrauding them. The individuals sought money and/or confidential information from their targets. One instance was reported as an email that appeared to come from a board president, using a realistic-looking email address which included the president's name and standard \"dca.ca.gov\" address, although it did still end in gmail.com. While no CPA licensees have reported being affected by the scam, the CBA encourages all licensees to be on the lookout for any requests that appear suspicious. The CBA created a page on its website devoted to warning licensees of scams. Please visit this page from time to time to be alerted if a new issue has arisen. Helping Your Employees Educated Outside the U.S. Obtain Their License Does your firm have employees with education earned outside of the United States who are applying for the Uniform CPA Examination (CPA Exam) or CPA licensure? The CBA relies solely on official transcripts and credential evaluation reports to determine if applicants meet the educational requirements, so it is important for your employees to be aware of the appropriate requirements. Applicants who attended or graduated from a school outside of the United States must have their education evaluated by a CBA-approved foreign credentials evaluation service. Evaluation reports must then be submitted to the CBA directly from the foreign credentials evaluation service. The current list of CBA-approved foreign credentials evaluation services is available on the CBA 's website by selecting the \" Applicants\" link from the home page. You will find the list located at the bottom of the Applicants page. For the detailed application process, please refer to the Uniform CPA Examination Handbook, also available on the CBA 's website. If you or your employee have questions, contact the CBA Examination Unit by email at examinfo@cba.ca.gov. California Board of Accountancy Newsletter 12 Enforcement Process Please state the licensee's name and license number, and allow 10 days for each request. Standard Terms of Probation CBA may revoke, suspend, or impose probation on a license for violation of applicable statutes or regulations. In addition to any case-specific terms of probation, the standard probationary terms include: Obey all federal, California, other state, and local laws, including those rules relating to the practice of public accountancy in California. Submit, within 10 days of completion of the quarter, written reports to CBA on a form obtained from CBA. The respondent shall submit, under penalty of perjury, such other written reports, declarations, and verification of actions as are required. These declarations shall contain statements relative to respondent's compliance with all the terms and conditions of probation. Respondent shall immediately execute all release of information forms as may be required by CBA or its representatives. During the period of probation, appear in person at interviews or meetings as directed by CBA or its designated representative, provided such notification is accomplished in a timely manner. Comply with the terms and conditions of the probation imposed by CBA, and cooperate fully with representatives of CBA in its monitoring and investigation of the respondent's compliance with probation terms and conditions. Be subject to and permit a \"practice investigation\" of the respondent's professional practice. Such \"practice investigation\" shall be conducted by representatives of CBA, provided notification of such review is accomplished in a timely manner. Comply with all final orders resulting from citations issued by CBA. In the event respondent should leave California to reside or practice outside this state, respondent must notify CBA in writing of the dates of departure and return. Periods of non-California residency or practice outside the state shall not apply to reduction of the probationary period, or of any suspension. No obligation imposed herein, including requirements to file written reports, reimburse CBA costs, or make restitution to consumers, shall be suspended or otherwise affected by such periods of out-of-state residency or practice, except at the written direction of CBA. If respondent violates probation in any respect, CBA, after giving respondent notice and an opportunity to be heard, may revoke probation and carry out the disciplinary and/or enforcement order that was stayed. If an accusation or a petition to revoke probation is filed against respondent during probation, CBA shall have continuing jurisdiction until the matter is final, and the period of probation shall be extended until the matter is final. Upon successful completion of probation, respondent's license will be fully restored. When CBA receives a complaint, an investigation is conducted. Information regarding a complaint generally is gathered by enforcement staff, which could include a licensee's appearance before the CBA Enforcement Advisory Committee. Following this investigation, a recommendation is made to either (1) close the case with no violation of the Accountancy Act or CBA Regulations; (2) require the licensee to take prescribed continuing education; (3) issue a citation and fine; or (4) refer the case to the Attorney General's Office for review and possible preparation of an accusation against the licensee or a statement of issues relating to the applicant. If charges are filed against a licensee, a hearing may be held before an independent administrative law judge who submits a proposed decision to be considered by CBA, or the matter may be settled. CBA may either accept the proposed decision or decide the matter itself. Please note that CBA actions reported here may not be final. After the effective date of CBA 's decision, the licensee may obtain judicial review of its decision. On occasion, a court will order a stay of CBA 's decision or return the decision to CBA for reconsideration. Copies of the accusations, decisions, and settlements regarding any of these disciplinary and/or enforcement actions are available on the CBA website, www.cba.ca.gov, or by sending a written request to: California Board of Accountancy Attention: Disciplinary/ Enforcement Actions 2450 Venture Oaks Way, Suite 300 Sacramento, CA 95833 UPDATE\u2014Fall 2021 13 Enforcement Definitions Accusation A formal document that charges violation(s) of the California Accountancy Act and/or CBA Regulations by a licensee.

Cost Recovery The licensee is ordered to pay CBA certain costs of investigation and prosecution including, but not limited to, attorney's fees. Default Decision The licensee failed to file a Notice of Defense or has otherwise failed to request a hearing, object, or otherwise contest the accusation. CBA takes action without a hearing based on the accusation and documentary evidence on file. Effective Date The date the disciplinary decision becomes operative. Probation The licensee may continue to engage in activities for which licensure is required, under specific terms and conditions. Reinstatement A revoked license that is restored, not sooner than one year from the date of revocation, to a clear or inactive status after petition to and approval by CBA.

Revocation The individual, partnership, or corporation no longer is licensed as a result of a disciplinary action. 13 Enforcement Process Continued from Page 10 Stayed The action does not immediately take place and may not take place if the licensee complies with other conditions (such as a probation term). Stipulation The matter is negotiated and settled without going to hearing. Surrendered The licensee has surrendered the license. The individual, partnership, or corporation no longer is licensed. CBA, however, may impose discipline against a surrendered license in certain circumstances. Surrender also may require certain conditions be met should the former licensee ever choose to reapply for licensure.

This report highlights the many CBA achievements in the past year and outlines programs implemented to meet our consumer protection mission and provide excellent service to our applicants and licensees. Patti Bowers Online Application for CPA Licensure Executive Offcer In April, the CBA launched an online application for CPA licensure. This new option provides the ability to submit applications, upload necessary documents, and pay the application and initial licensee fees entirely on the CBA website. During its frst few months of operations, approximately two-thirds of applicants have utilized the online application, and we expect that percentage to climb higher. Applicants can now access a personal dashboard to monitor the review process of their application. This is a major improvement in the overall initial licensure experience for our applicants. In order to promote the online application, the CBA, with help from the digital team at the Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA), produced a video spotlighting the excitement surrounding the new online capabilities. The video has been viewed over 2,900 times across all the CBA social media platforms. Outreach and Social Media The CBA had a busy schedule of outreach events despite colleges and universities holding classes online for the entire academic year. The CBA took part in six virtual events conducted directly with individual schools, and another event aimed at a statewide audience of community college students. More than 600 students in total attended CBA outreach events in fscal year 2020-21 . We will detail these events more closely in this report. The CBA 's social media pages continue to grow, accumulating nearly 1,600 new followers, equating to a 20% gain since our last Annual Report. Military and Refugee/Asylee/Special Immigrant Visa Holder Liaison Early in 2021, the CBA expanded its existing webpage focused on military-related assistance to include specifc information and resources for military spouses and domestic partners. Concurrently, we also established an email address and toll-free telephone number dedicated to assisting these individuals, and appointed a staff member to act as their direct liaison within the CBA. We are honored to provide this assistance to our armed forces. A similar program was introduced to aid refugees, asylees, and special immigrant visa holders, who also have a direct liaison along with a dedicated email address and toll-free telephone number to be used for assistance. Enforcement The Enforcement Division received 2,729 complaints and closed 2,692 investigations in fscal year 2020-21 . Of the total investigations closed, 2,058, or 76%, were closed within six months from the initial complaint investigation date. Further, 2,546 investigations, or 95%, were closed within one year. 5 As part of a recent disciplinary matter, the CBA required a large accounting frm to develop continuing education focused on the subject matter of ethics that the CBA will approve, and to make the hours available to all California CPAs at no cost. The inclusion of a continuing education element requires the accounting frm to demonstrate a strong recognition regarding its misconduct, and a commitment to advancing the CBA 's mission of consumer protection by reinforcing the importance of ethics in the accounting profession. These are only samples of the CBA 's achievements in fscal year 2020-21 . More will be addressed in this report. We anticipate even more innovations in the year to come, which will beneft consumers and stakeholders as we strive to continue to meet our consumer protection mission. Patti Bowers Executive Offcer 6 MISSION STATEMENT To protect consumers by ensuring only qualifed licensees practice public accountancy in accordance with established professional standards. VISION STATEMENT All consumers are well informed and receive quality accounting services from licensees they can trust. ORGANIZATION For more than 100 years, the California Legislature has entrusted the CBA with protecting the public related to the practice of public accountancy in California. The CBA 's mission to protect consumers is at the core of the work that is accomplished. The breadth of the CBA 's infuence in the regulatory environment stretches beyond California's borders. The CBA regulates more than 111,000 licensees, including individuals (certifed public accountants and public accountants) and accounting frms (partnerships, corporations, and out-of-state registered accounting frms). Many of the accounting frms that the CBA regulates have national and international footprints, reaching clients worldwide. CPAs work in a variety of areas, including accounting frms, private industry, government, and academia. CPAs provide services to clients of all sizes and needs. The CBA recognizes the scope of its regulatory infuence. The protection of the public shapes the policies, regulations, and enforcement decisions reached by the CBA. Collectively, the three divisions of the CBA\u2014Enforcement, Licensing, and Administration\u2014work to ensure that consumers are protected and stakeholders receive high-quality customer service. 7 7 CALIFORNIA BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY COMPOSITION The CBA is composed of 15 members, eight of whom are public members, not licensed by the CBA, and seven of whom are licensees of the CBA. The Governor appoints four of the public members and all licensee members. The Senate Rules Committee and the Speaker of the Assembly each appoint two public members. Current California Board of Accountancy Members Nancy J. Corrigan, CPA Michael M. Savoy, CPA Mark J. Silverman, Esq.

To achieve its mission, the CBA operates in a fscally responsible manner to ensure funds are spent exclusively to support this mandate. STRATEGIC PLAN HIGHLIGHTS The CBA implemented a fee increase that became effective January 1, 2020 for license renewals and initial licensing fees. The fee increase was necessary to more closely align the CBA 's revenues and expenditures. Fiscal year 2020-21 represented completion of the frst full year of the fee increase and its cumulative effect on the Reserve Fund. While the noted fee increase to $250 represented a necessary step to create better balance between revenues and expenditures, staff continue to work on a regulatory proposal to increase license renewal and initial licensure fees to the statutory maximum of $280. The rulemaking proposal was approved by DCA and fled with the Offce of Administrative Law in June 2021 . A public hearing on the proposed increase was held in August and is presently pending submission to the Offce of Administrative The CBA allocates its budget to various organizational units to best meet its consumer protection mission while also striving to provide the best customer service to its stakeholders. The chart below depicts all of the organizational units comprising the CBA and their associated funding levels for 2020-21 . STATISTICS Allocations 8.0% Enforcement $6,445,809 / 39.5% 12 EXPENDITURES Personnel Services General Expense Printing Communication Postage Insurance Travel In-State Travel Out-of-State Training Facilities Operations Consulting and Professional Services (internal) Consulting and Professional Services (external) Department of Consumer Affairs Pro Rata Departmental Services Consolidated Data Centers Information Technology Equipment Special Items of Expense Scheduled Reimbursements Unscheduled Reimbursements are based on fscal month 13 reports and refect actual amounts expended. The expenditure amounts shown are not equal to the amounts shown on the fund condition report due to the fund condition displaying both expended and encumbered amounts. 13 Reserve Level The CBA 's reserve level for end of fscal year 2020-21 was $12,863,000, which is an approximate 7 .9 months in reserve. The CBA operates within its legislatively established budget and ensures spending does not exceed its authorized amount. At the end of each fscal year, the CBA will revert any unspent monies to its reserve. FUND CONDITION STATEMENT (Dollars in Thousands) Fiscal Year Fiscal Year Fiscal Year 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 Beginning Balance Interest, Loans to General Fund N/A N/A Loans Repaid from General Fund N/A Total Revenue and Fund Balance $20,816 $12,863 $10,352 Months in Reserve 15.8 7.9 1 $218,000 was deducted to pay previous year's expenses or invoices that came in late or after the end of the fscal year closing. 2 Expenditure fgures on this fund condition statement consist of actual expenditures and encumbered amounts. Encumbered amounts may be refected on the fund condition statement for up to three years, and then are included in the prior year adjustment amount. 3 Fiscal year 2021-22 is a projection expending full budget authority. 14 6.2 On the Horizon The CBA is anticipating completion of its fee analysis in late 2021 . The fee analysis is to determine if present fee levels align with the cost to perform the corresponding service. Based on the outcome of the fee analysis statutory or regulatory changes may be necessary. The CBA 's personnel expenditures in 2021-22 were signifcantly reduced as employee pay reductions were implemented statewide in response to California's economic crisis caused by COVID-19. The pay reduction became effective July 1, 2020, and was originally expected to be in place for two years. However, the 9.23% reduction in pay was restored one year sooner than expected due to the vast improvement in California's economic condition. COVID-19 and its resultant statewide fscal effects also prompted the state of California to internally borrow money from its special fund agencies in July 2020. The CBA was one of many DCA entities selected by the Pooled Money Investment Board to make such a General Fund loan. The CBA 's loan to the General Fund in 2020-21 was for $10 million and is scheduled to be repaid with interest in fscal year 2024-25 or sooner, as economic conditions improve. Additional Resources To keep CBA members and stakeholders apprised of the CBA 's fscal standing, a budget report is presented during CBA meetings. The information includes expenditures, year-end projections, staffng allocations, and the Accountancy Fund status. The budget information for CBA meetings is posted on the website. The presentation on the CBA 's budget can be viewed during the meeting webcast and the video is archived on the CBA website. For additional transparency, a report on the CBA 's budget is provided annually in the UPDATE publication. This report contains budget allocation information, expenditures, and upcoming budgetary changes. Additional information can be found in prior annual reports (available at www.cba.ca.gov under the \"Communications & Outreach\" tab). 15 16 OUTREACH OUTREACH EVENTS It was a busy year for the CBA, despite colleges and universities shifting to online classes. The CBA worked with fve universities to execute six virtual outreach events during 2020-21 aimed to inspire and educate students in how and why they should pursue CPA licensure after graduation. There was also an event with a private corporation and an event aimed at a statewide audience of community college students. It is estimated that CBA outreach events reached a total of 600 students during 2020-21 . Videos of many of the events were posted to the CBA Y ouT ube channel and linked from the CBA website for ongoing viewing. September 2020 Intel Corporation The Intel Corporation invited the CBA to speak at its September 15 online event titled \"CPA/CMA Roadshow, \" geared toward Intel's accounting and fnance professionals located in California and neighboring states. CBA Examination Unit Manager Suzanne Gracia discussed the requirements and steps involved to obtain a CPA license. CBA President Nancy J. Corrigan, CPA September 2020 \"From Community College to CPA\" The California Society of CPAs (CalCPA) held \"From Community College to CPA, \" the frst time the event was online. This allowed CalCPA to promote the event to accounting students across the state. President Corrigan spoke about the role of the CBA, requirements for CPA licensure, and participated in a panel discussion with other CPAs and community college professors. Nearly 100 students from all corners of the state watched that evening, from Sierra College in Northern California to Pasadena City College in Southern California, and many points in between. 17 17 October 2020 California State Polytechnic University, Pomona The CBA partnered with California State Polytechnic University, Pomona's (Cal Poly Pomona) Department of Accounting for an educational outreach event, which occurred October 6. Nearly 200 of Cal Poly Pomona's accounting and fnance students participated in the online seminar. The program was broken up into two segments. The frst was an hour-long presentation and panel discussion featuring President Corrigan, a Cal Poly Pomona alumna and a member of its Accounting Department Advisory Council; along with CalCPA Chair Jolene Fraser, CPA; Mel Hudson, CPA, partner at RSM US; and Cal Poly Pomona Director of Graduate Studies Dr. Meihau Koo. The panel addressed the future of the accounting feld and its job market, and answered relevant questions, such as how COVID-19 may have changed opportunities to gain the experience necessary to apply for licensure. The second segment consisted of four hours of individual student assessments. During this time, four CBA staff reviewed students' transcripts to provide guidance regarding the education requirements for the CPA Examination and CPA licensure. Fifty-eight Cal Poly Pomona students took advantage of this opportunity. Due to the event's success, Cal Poly Pomona staff discussed conducting the event again in spring 2021, and expanding it to twice a year. January 2021 Golden Gate University Approximately 50 Golden Gate University (GGU) students participated virtually on January 25 in an event titled \"CPA\u2014Game Changer!\" President Corrigan spoke about the role of the CBA and the value of the CPA title, including how it made a difference in her career. Teaming with President Corrigan were CBA Examination Unit Manager Ms. Gracia and Initial Licensing Unit Manager Ramona Bermudez, who covered the topics of the qualifcations and application process for the CPA Examination and CPA licensure. CBA Member Mary M. Geong, CPA, an alumna of GGU, joined the lineup to speak about her career from graduation to CPA, including now being on the CBA. CBA staff also answered a variety of student questions after the presentations. GGU staff was highly appreciative and said the event was valuable for their students. February 2021 San Francisco State University The \"Pathways to Success in Accounting\" event took place February 11, in partnership with CalCPA and San Francisco State University. The event featured a variety of speakers from a broad spectrum of accounting careers. President Corrigan, Ms. Gracia, and Ms. Bermudez represented the CBA and gave presentations on a similar slate of topics as at GGU, but also focusing on upcoming changes to the CPA Examination in 2024. In an effort to connect more effectively with the audience in a virtual outreach setting, an updated deck of PowerPoint slides complementing the CBA presentations was debuted at this event, with three examples of the slides shown on the next page. These new slides gave the CBA presentations a fresher feel and more visually appealing look. 18 18 April 2021 San Jose State University On April 14, the CBA took part in an outreach event with San Jose State University attended by approximately 80 students. President Corrigan spoke about the role of the CBA and the value of the CPA title, including how it made a difference in her career. Presenting with President Corrigan were CBA Examination Unit staff, who covered the topics of the qualifcations and application process for the CPA Exam and CPA licensure, along with a mention of changes coming to the CPA Exam in 2024. CBA staff also answered a variety of student questions after the presentations. April 2021 California State Polytechnic University, Pomona Following a successful outreach event with Cal Poly Pomona in fall 2020, staff invited the CBA to partner with them for a similar event in the spring. The event, which featured an hour of presentations and four hours of one-on-one student educational assessments, occurred April 21, and was watched by over 100 students. President Corrigan, Ms. Gracia, and Ms. Bermudez, were joined by CBA staff member David Hemphill for the presentation portion, speaking about a similar slate of topics as at San Jose State University. Ms. Bermudez also announced the new online application process for CPA licensure, which had just been activated the previous day. Thirty Cal Poly Pomona students met individually with CBA staff members Jennifer Huddy, Jennifer Jackson, Diane Edwards, and Delia Tomas to discuss their coursework, and where the students stood in fulflling the education requirements to sit for the CPA Examination and apply for CPA licensure. May 2021 California State University, San Bernardino The fnal event of the spring semester happened May 4. In addition to President Corrigan, Ms. Bermudez, and Mr. Hemphill's presentations, California State University, San Bernardino alumni members of the Inland Empire chapter of CalCPA gave opening remarks and discussed their CPA career journeys from graduation to today. More than 100 students participated. 19 19 SOCIAL MEDIA GROWTH The CBA 's Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn social media pages added nearly 1,600 followers during 2020-21, a growth of 20%. The platforms are on pace to surpass 10,000 total followers before the end of 2021 . Social media posts in the past year have ranged from helpful reminders regarding license renewals and announcements of the new online application, to messages coordinated with the Governor's Offce, such as raising awareness of the COVID-19 vaccines and encouraging Californians to conserve energy during Flex Alerts. In July 2020, the CBA launched a social media campaign featuring weekly updates regarding the amount of time it was currently taking to review applications. The posts consisted of Processing Date Calendars to give a visual representation of the processing times, and the calendars used a retro-inspired font intended to grab followers' attention. The campaign caught the attention of a national accounting blog, which wrote an entire article about the posts, and praised the CBA for its transparency. The weekly posts also spurred numerous comments and private messages, as applicants seeing the increased interaction became aware that the CBA 's social media pages could be an additional way to communicate. This is another opportunity for CBA staff to provide excellent customer service by answering questions in a timely manner. CBA staff sends news releases to traditional media outlets regarding CBA member appointments and annual member elections. In addition, following the approval of disciplinary cases at CBA meetings and the posting of the related orders on the CBA website, staff informs reporters and editors throughout California of the enforcement actions. 20 STRATEGIC PLANNING OVERVIEW The CBA continues to make signifcant progress in meeting the goals and objectives identifed in its 2019-2021 Strategic Plan.

An Environmental Scan will be completed and the new strategic plan will be released in early 2022. 22 ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES OVERVIEW The Enforcement Program's primary responsibility is to oversee the enforcement of California laws and rules governing the practice of public accountancy. It does this by: Conducting complex investigations regarding practice issues that require the expertise of a licensed CPA. Conducting investigations for administrative violations and unlicensed activity. Issuing citations and fnes for violations that do not rise to the level of discipline. Filing accusations and imposing discipline. Assigning and monitoring referrals to the Offce of the Attorney General. Monitoring licensees on probation.

During prior fscal year (2,295). The overall inventory of fscal year 2020-21, the Enforcement Program pending complaints at the end of this fscal year conducted six investigative hearings. was 779. The Enforcement Program continues to focus on decreasing the number of complaints pending over 24 months. Since the end of fscal 23 Complaints Received The Enforcement Program receives complaints from consumers, licensees, professional societies, law enforcement, other government agencies, and internal referrals. In addition, staff regularly monitors other outlets, including the news media and social media, for information that may suggest licensees' violations of the California Accountancy Act and CBA regulations. The internal complaints from the CBA Licensing Program include various licensing renewal defciencies related to continuing education, unlicensed activity, potential discrepancies in peer review reporting, and conviction and subsequent arrest notifcations. 2,729 Complaints Internal External 1,294 1,435 47% 53% Internal External Investigations The Enforcement Program closed 2,656 cases in 2020-21 . The average days to close an investigation was 113. Investigations 2020-21 Assigned for Investigation 2,729 Investigations Closed 2,656 Average Days to Close 113 24 Working With the Attorney General's Offce The number of referrals to the Attorney General's Offce stayed constant in 2020-21 with 51 cases compared to 50 in the prior fscal year. The number of cases pending at the Attorney General's Offce decreased slightly from 41 cases in 2019-20 to 39 in 2020-21 . The continued decrease in the past three years is primarily attributed to the Enforcement Program's effectiveness in working to obtain settlement shortly after a pleading is fled. Attorney General's Offce 2020-21 Referrals 51 Cases Pending 39 Disciplinary Actions The CBA took action on 50 matters, the majority of which were through stipulated settlements. This is a decrease in the number of matters handled by the CBA in fscal year 2019-20, which was 69. This decrease over the last two fscal years can be attributed to the decrease in cases pending at the Attorney General's Offce. Disciplinary Actions 2020-21 34 Stipulations 7 Proposed Decisions 9 Default Decisions Citations The CBA uses its citation and fne authority for violations that do not rise to the level of discipline, and as a mechanism to gain compliance from licensees. In 2020-21, the CBA issued 376 citations, which is 116% more than the previous year. The top three violations included: CBA Regulations section 87(a)(1) (20/12 Continuing Education Requirement) - Note: The citations issued were for licensees who failed to complete a minimum of 20 hours of continuing education in each year of their two-year license renewal period (with a minimum of 12 hours in technical subject matter). This regulation is commonly referred to as the \"20/12 requirement. \" CBA Regulations section 52 (Response to CBA Inquiry) CBA Regulations section 87 (Continuing Education Basic Requirement) Unlicensed Activity The CBA actively investigates unlicensed matters from both external/consumer complaints and internally identifed matters on CPAs or accountancy frms operating with an expired license, individuals without 25 a CPA license, and unregistered accounting frms. Generally, the Enforcement Program is able to obtain compliance from individuals, but does issue citations or refer matters to local law enforcement or the district attorney when warranted. The number of complaints received regarding unlicensed matters increased signifcantly, from 142 complaints received during 2019-20, to 475 complaints received during 2020-21, a 234% increase. The Enforcement Program closed 401 unlicensed complaints during 2020-21, a 116% increase from 2019-20. Unlicensed Activity 2020-21 Complaints Received 475 Investigations Pending 146 Unlicensed Activity Outcomes 2020-21 Citations Issued 17 Closed for Compliance 382 Referred to District Attorney/Local Law 2 Enforcement Total 401 Probation Monitoring Probation monitoring is an important program and essential aspect of the CBA 's consumer protection mission. It helps ensure only qualifed licensees practice public accountancy in accordance with established professional standards. 120 PROBATIONERS 20% 4 24 Decrease from Petitions to revoke Probation prior fscal year probation fled orientations conducted 26 Practice Privilege Reporting This table depicts the enforcement aspects of the CBA 's mobility program in these identifed areas: Practice Privilege Reporting Total Pre-Notifcation Forms Received 1 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Discipline Identifed 0 Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Discipline Identifed 7 Out-of-State Accounting Firms that Reported Other Discipline 3 External Complaints Against Practice Privilege Holders 1 Enforcement Performance Measures Enforcement Performance Measures Target Result Number of Complaints and Convictions Received N/A 2,729 Number of Complaints Closed or Assigned to an Investigator N/A 2,729 Average Number of Days from Complaint Receipt to the Date the Complaint Was Closed or Assigned to an Investigator 10 days 1 day Number of Investigations Closed (Not Including Cases Transmitted to the Attorney General) N/A 2,656 Average Number of Days to Complete the Entire Enforcement Process for Cases Not Transmitted to the Attorney General (Includes Intake and Investigation) 180 days 113 days Cases Closed After Transmission to the Attorney General for Formal Disciplinary Action (Including Formal Discipline and Closures Without Formal Discipline, e.g., Withdrawals, Dismissals, etc.) N/A 54 Cases Closed After Transmission to the Attorney General for Formal Disciplinary Action (Including Formal Discipline and Closures Without Formal Discipline, e.g., Withdrawals, Dismissals, etc.) 540 days 915 days Number of New Probation Cases N/A 30 Average Number of Days from the Date a Violation of Probation is Reported to the Date the Assigned Monitor Initiates Appropriate Action 15 days 1 day 27 The CBA 's Investigation Cycle Time was 113 days. Although this is an increase compared to the last fscal year's cycle of 82 days, the CBA investigated 361 more cases than last fscal year. The average number of days to complete investigations is a result of process changes made within the Enforcement Program's Intake Unit. The CBA 's average number of days for the Formal Discipline Performance Measure increased from 904 days for 2019-20 to 915 in 2020-21 . The performance measure associated with formal discipline calculates the average number of days to complete the entire enforcement process from the date the complaint was received until the effective date of the fnal discipline for decisions that took effect during that quarter. As the Enforcement Program works to address its aging case inventory and the CBA acts on these matters, there will be a direct impact on this performance measure. On the Horizon Consistent with the CBA 's mission of consumer protection, the CBA will be continuing to work collaboratively with other state boards, agencies, and regulators in investigating unlicensed activity to ensure consumers are receiving services from appropriately licensed professionals. The Enforcement Program will begin making updates and modifcations to the CBA Disciplinary Guidelines and Model Orders (Guidelines). This will ensure any new statutes and regulations are appropriately identifed in the Guidelines and update any of the various model orders and terms and conditions of probation to refect CBA expectations for its various decisions and orders. Additional Resources The CBA offers an online complaint form and information to assist consumers who may have concerns or a complaint against a licensee. It is available at www.cba.ca.gov under the \"Consumers\" tab. Additionally, there are helpful resources on the CBA website under the \" Applicants\" and \"Licensees\" tabs to assist applicants and licensees in understanding the enforcement process, including: The Enforcement Handbook for CPA Licensure Applicants The Enforcement Handbook for Licensees 28 LICENSING ACTIVITIES OVERVIEW The Licensing Program's primary charge in meeting the CBA 's consumer protection mission is to regulate entry and continuing practice in the profession by ensuring that only those who are qualifed are licensed to practice public accountancy. Its three units\u2014Examination, Initial Licensing, and Renewal and Continuing Competency\u2014act as gatekeepers for the profession by ensuring: Applicants meet education requirements prior to taking the CPA Examination. Applicants for licensure meet the examination, education, and experience requirements necessary for CPA licensure. Accountancy partnerships and corporations are appropriately registered. Applicants for renewal maintain reasonable currency of knowledge. Out-of-state registered accounting frms that intend to perform specifed accounting services for entities headquartered in California meet the minimum registration requirements. STRATEGIC PLAN HIGHLIGHTS The CBA maintains a 30-day processing target for its applications. The CBA reports this target timeframe to the Governor's Offce and the California Legislature as part of performance-based budgeting requirements and is included in the CBA 's 2019-2021 Strategic Plan. Licensing Program staff worked collaboratively with CBA and DCA IT staff to create the online application for CPA licensure for candidates applying for a CPA license. CPA licensing applicants are able to submit a complete application, upload and attach supporting documents, and pay the application fee online. An online dashboard for CPA licensing applicants was created to further support applicants. After receipt of a licensing application, applicants are able to log into their dashboard to monitor the status of the application by tracking CBA receipt and approval of various supporting documentation (e.g., transcripts, experience forms, etc.). The Qualifcations Committee met virtually throughout the fscal year, conducting critical interviews of applicants and employers to support recommendations for licensure to the Licensing Program staff. To assist in the interview process, Licensing Program staff developed a fyer providing guidance to those who must appear before the Qualifcations Committee, in an effort to facilitate a smoother appearance process. The CBA will resume Prometric Testing Center visits in 2021-22. The purpose of Prometric test center visits are to evaluate how testing center staff adhere to security and other procedural requirements. 29 21,816 Applications Approved for the CPA Examination 6,183 Repeat Applications First-Time Applications 15,633 Application and Licensure Statistics Provided here is an overview of the application and licensure volume for both individual and accounting frm licenses: Application Type 2020-21* First-Time CPA Examination Received Initial CPA Licensure Received 3,577 Approved 4,046 CPA Accountancy Firm Received 436 Approved 477 Renewals Received 48,641 Approved 46,986 *Note: Applications received at the end of the fscal year may not be processed until the following fscal year. 30 Population Firm Registrations Out-of-state accounting frms that hold a valid and current license, certifcate, or permit to practice public accountancy from another state are required to register with the CBA prior to performing specifed services though a qualifed practice privilege holder.

The CBA will continue exploring methods that streamline processes, create effciencies, and leverage resources to more quickly process applications and assist applicants on their pathway to licensure. The CBA is scheduled to begin work on the Business Modernization pilot project in fall 2021 . The pilot will focus on automating the license renewal process. 557 104 67 34 762 Additional Resources The CBA website\u2014www.cba.ca.gov\u2014contains signifcant resources for applicants and licensees including: Exam Quick Tips and Licensing Quick Tips Handbooks for CPA Examination, CPA licensure, and licensees' frequently asked questions Webinars on CPA examination and CPA licensure requirements 32 Assistance to Military and Refugees/Asylees/ Special Immigrant Visa Holders The CBA has had information on its website focused on assisting the military and their families for several years. In early 2021, the CBA revamped the information and expanded it to not only include information to military members, but also to refugees/asylees/special immigrant visa holders regarding available resources, such as priority review and expedited application processing. The CBA also established both a military-specifc and a refugee/asylee/special immigrant visa holder - specifc email address and toll-free telephone number. A military and refugee/asylee/special immigrant visa holder liaison was also appointed. The liaison serves as a primary point of contact and is available to directly assist these applicants and licensees. Through the end of June 2021, there had been 107 inquiries received through the military email and phone number, and four through the same refugee services. The CBA 's Executive Offcer, along with other DCA Executive staff, were invited to provide a presentation at the Department of Social Services regarding Assembly Bill 2113 (Chapter 186 of 2020), which implemented many of the provisions aimed at assisting refugee/asylee/special immigrant visa holder applicants. Further, the CBA has taken a support position on several legislative proposals aimed at assisting military members and their families with easing the logistics of obtaining a license to practice public accountancy in California. CBA staff provided testimony in support of Assembly Bill 1386, which would have eliminated the fees associated with initial licensure and some examination fees. Since the implementation of these practices, the CBA has received positive feedback from those using the liaison's assistance. The newly implemented practices have improved our customer service and application processing times for these individuals, and we look forward to continuing to serve them in this manner in the future.

This is accomplished by using the following best practices: Tracking and monitoring the status of bills that may impact the CBA 's mission or its operations. Developing and maintaining relationships with the Legislature to help ensure the CBA has the resources and policies in place to protect consumers. Communicating with the authors of bills of interest to the CBA, inviting those authors to attend CBA meetings, providing CBA 's legislative analyses, and expressing willingness to meet and discuss pending legislation. Identifying activities that help the CBA in effectively engaging with the Legislature and appropriately advocating for its position on bills and emerging issues. Engaging with stakeholders including DCA, other boards and bureaus, representatives of CalCPA, national accounting frms, and consumer advocates. Initiating changes to statutes or regulatory requirements consistent with CBA-approved policy. STRATEGIC PLAN HIGHLIGHTS The highlight of the CBA 's legislative activity for 2021 has been the CBA 's sponsorship of AB 298 (Irwin). Working collaboratively with CalCPA and other stakeholder groups, the proposal would enable applicants to sit for the CPA Examination 180 days prior to completing their educational requirements. In addition, the proposal would add additional qualifying coursework in ethics, preserve the privacy of email addresses of applicants and licensees held by the CBA, and would authorize the CBA secretary/treasurer or another CBA member to preside over CBA meetings. During 2021, staff engaged with the Legislature, DCA, and other stakeholders to advocate for the CBA 's position on these key bills: AB 105 (Holden)\u2014CBA POSITION: WATCH Outcome: Vetoed Summary: Beginning January 1, 2022, all state boards and commissions must have at least one volunteer member from an underrepresented community. This requirement will only apply as vacancies occur. AB 105 requires the State Personnel Board to prescribe, and the Department of Human Resources to oversee, compliance with a merit-based civil service system to govern appointments, classifcations, examinations, probationary periods, and disciplinary actions. The bill authorizes the Department of Human Resources (CalHR) to 1) conduct audits and investigations of personnel practices and 2) investigate complaints fled by employees in a state department's Equal Employment Opportunity Program. AB 105 would 35 also require hiring oral examinations to be video or otherwise electronically recorded, and such recordings be maintained for three years and that CalHR develop model upward mobility goals by July 1, 2022. AB 107 (Salas)\u2014CBA POSITION: SUPPORT Outcome: Chapter 693 of 2021 Summary: This bill would require a board within DCA to, after appropriate investigation, issue a temporary license to practice a profession to an applicant who meets the following requirements: 1) is married to, a domestic partnership or other legal union with, an active duty member of the U.S. armed forces assigned to a duty station in California, and 2) has a current, active, and unrestricted license to practice their profession in another U.S. jurisdiction. The provisions for the issuance of a temporary license would not apply to a board, such as the CBA, that has a process under which these individuals are able to receive expedited, temporary authorization to practice while meeting state-specifc requirements for a period of at least one year. AB 107 would also require DCA and its boards to post information on their websites relating to licensure for these individuals. AB 298 (Irwin)\u2014CBA POSITION: SPONSOR Outcome: Chapter 300 of 2021 Summary: This bill would allow the CBA to admit applicants to sit for the CPA Examination 180 days prior to completing their educational requirements, under certain conditions. The bill also provides greater latitude with regard to courses to satisfy the CBA 's ethics requirements. AB 298 also includes additional minor proposals related to the privacy of applicant and licensee email addresses, and would authorize the CBA secretary/treasurer or another CBA member to preside over CBA meetings. AB 646 (Low)\u2014CBA POSITION: WATCH Outcome: Assembly Appropriations Committee (Two-Year Bill) Summary: This bill would require a licensing board under DCA, including the CBA, to update information on its website regarding licensees who have had their licenses revoked due to criminal conviction(s) that are subsequently expunged, pursuant to Penal Code section 1203.4. AB 885 (Quirk)\u2014CBA POSITION: SUPPORT Outcome: Assembly Governmental Organization Committee (Two-Year Bill) Summary: This bill would revise the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act to encourage greater accessibility for both the public and members of a state body, when state bodies elect to use teleconferencing technology. The bill would defne teleconferencing as participation in a meeting both audibly and visually. Under provisions of the bill, members of a state body participating remotely would count towards a quorum and would only require public disclosure of the designated primary physical meeting location from which the public may participate. AB 1026 (Smith)\u2014CBA POSITION: SUPPORT Outcome: Assembly Appropriations Committee (Two-Year Bill) Summary: This bill would require DCA, and any board within DCA, to grant a 50% fee reduction for an initial license to an applicant who provides satisfactory evidence that they have served as an active duty member of the U.S. armed forces or the California National Guard and was honorably discharged. AB 1316 (O'Donnell)\u2014CBA POSITION: WATCH Outcome: Assembly Inactive File Summary: This bill would require that by January 1, 2023, the CBA, in consultation with the chief executive offcer of the County Offce Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team, adopt regulations requiring: That 12 of the 80 hours of continuing education required as a condition of license renewal shall be in the areas of accounting, auditing, or related subjects pertaining to California local educational agencies for CPAs who are engaged in fnancial and compliance audits of a local educational agency. 36 That peer reviews are required for accountants conducting audits of local education agencies prior to engaging in that activity. AB 1386 (Cunningham)\u2014CBA POSITION: SUPPORT Outcome: Assembly Appropriations Committee (Two-Year Bill) Summary: This bill would prohibit a board within DCA from charging an initial application fee, an initial license issuance fee, or an initial examination fee to an applicant who meets the existing expedited licensing requirements for spouses, domestic partners, or other legal partners of members of the U.S. armed forces with an assigned duty station in California. The initial examination fee shall only be waived if the examination is administered by the board. SB 607 (Min)\u2014CBA POSITION: SUPPORT Outcome: Chapter 367 of 2021 Summary: The bill would, among other proposals, require all boards within DCA, including the CBA, to waive all fees charged by the board associated with the application and initial license for applicants who are married to, in a domestic partnership or other legal union with, an active duty member of the U.S. armed forces assigned to a duty station in California, under offcial active duty military orders, and who hold a current license in another U.S. jurisdiction for which the applicant seeks a license from the board. SB 607 provisions relating to the fee waiver will be effective July 1, 2022. SB 607 contains other proposals that do SB 702 (Lim\u00f3n)\u2014CBA POSITION: SUPPORT Outcome: Vetoed Summary: This bill would require that on or before March 1, 2022, the Governor's Offce convene a working group to discuss and make recommendations on the most effective way to ensure the state's leadership on boards and commissions refects diversity in age, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, disability status, region, veteran status, and sexual orientation, among other things. The bill specifes the composition of the working group, identifes the issues its recommendations shall address, and details information to be reported annually to the Legislature and made available to the public on the Governor's website. The working group shall meet beginning April 1, 2022, and fve additional times before May 1, 2023, before completing its work by January 1, 2024. SB 731 (Durazo)\u2014CBA POSITION: WATCH Outcome: Failed Passage in Assembly (Reconsideration Granted) Summary: This bill would require the Department of Justice to expand provisions regarding criminal record relief, without requiring a petition or motion by a party for that relief, to include an arrest and a conviction of a felony, if specifed conditions are met. It would make an arrest for a felony, where there is no indication that the criminal proceeding has been initiated at least three years after the arrest, eligible for relief. It amends existing law to provide that if the arrest was for a jail or prison felony with a sentence of eight or more years, the record of that arrest shall be eligible for relief when no criminal proceedings have happened six years after the arrest. It would make all felonies eligible for relief, not just jail felonies, and provides that if the defendant was on mandatory supervision, the parole offcer shall notify the prosecuting attorney when a petition is fled. SB 772 (Ochoa Bough)\u2014CBA POSITION: WATCH Outcome: Senate Business, Professions and Economic Development Committee (Two-Year Bill) Summary: This bill would prohibit any board, bureau, or commission within DCA, including the CBA, from assessing an administrative fne for a violation of the applicable licensing act or any adopted regulation if the violation is a minor violation, as specifed. NOTE: Two-year bills will not be taken up again in 2021, and are not eligible for further action until 2022.

This chart indicates each pending or approved regulatory change: Title 16 California Code of Regulations/Status Subject Approved AB 2138\u2014Disciplinary Guidelines; Substantial 98, 99, 99.1, 99.2 Relationship Criteria; Rehabilitation Criteria for Denials, Suspensions, Revocations, Restorations, and Reduction of Penalty; and Directly and Adversely Financial Crime Criteria 45 Peer Review Reporting (Firms) Amend PR-1 Pending 12.5 Update Attest Experience Forms 19 Practice Privilege Form 70 License Renewal and Initial Licensure Fee Increase 7. 1 Continuous Testing 2.8 Satisfactory Evidence 87 , 88, 88.1, 88.2, 89, 90 Continuing Education Requirements 54.3, 54.4 Sale, Transfer, or Discontinuance of Practice 38 On the Horizon The CBA will be undergoing Sunset Review in 2023. Sunset Review provides the Legislature with an opportunity to conduct a thorough review of the CBA 's programs and effectiveness of protecting consumers. The Legislature last conducted a Sunset Review of the CBA in 2019. The CBA President and an additional CBA member will provide testimony regarding CBA operations and respond to various questions regarding activities and accomplishments over the prior four years. There will also be an opportunity to discuss new issues the CBA is facing and possible legislative solutions. On the legislative front, the CBA is exploring the development of proposals to update the criteria surrounding a licensee's Retired Status, frm ownership requirements, and changes to enable additional use of electronic mail by eliminating any specifc requirements to the use of \"mailings\" for communications. Additional Resources The following legislative and regulatory information is posted on the CBA website: California Accountancy Act Current and pending CBA regulations Pending legislation upon which the CBA has taken a position 39 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Business Modernization Project The CBA continues to work closely with DCA on its Business Modernization Project to achieve its goal of creating a more effcient and automated licensing and enforcement process for consumers, applicants, licensees, and other stakeholders. These improvements will be enabled by a new, integrated IT system, which will replace several legacy systems and applications. The CBA and DCA worked on compiling information to detail the planning and project phases of the project to identify staffng resources, contracts, procurement of software, and identifcation of roles for all that are participating. The information is provided to the California Department of Technology, which provides the oversight of all statewide information technology projects. The next step in the CBA 's Business Modernization Project is a pilot project scheduled to start in fall 2021 with a projected completion date of January 2022. The pilot project will focus on automating the license renewal process and submission of online complaints. The CBA continues to make certain the Business Modernization Project remains a high priority and has made staffng adjustments internally to provide DCA with the staff support it needs to ensure a successful outcome. COVID-19 Technology Response and Security Precautions CBA 's IT staff continued to enhance the CBA 's remote work infrastructure in order to improve reliability and staff effciency. Central to this effort was the addition of support for network printers and network scanners for a remote work infrastructure. Support for these devices allows staff to more fully replicate the functionality of the CBA offce environment when working remotely. In addition, more Windows Remote Desktop Services servers were added along with virtual private network access gateways that serve staff to increase reliability through additional redundancy. The CBA successfully completed its bi-annual comprehensive Information Systems security audit in April 2021 . The audit was performed by the California Military Department's Cyber Network Defense Team. This audit followed the signifcant changes made to the CBA 's IT infrastructure to address the need for remote work. This was done because of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the needs of staff that returned to work in the CBA offce. The CBA 's successful performance in this audit provided independent, third-party validation of the security of the CBA 's IT infrastructure for both remote and in-offce CBA staff. 41 The CBA also initiated the purchase of replacement personal computers, laptops, and monitors, as most of the existing equipment has aged beyond its useful life. This new equipment will help the CBA modernize its IT infrastructure and align more closely with DCA 's existing IT infrastructure. The CBA expects to receive this new equipment in fall 2021 . The CBA also partnered with the DCA Offce of Information Services on Business Modernization and a transition to the online licensing application system. The collaborative work with DCA will be expanded in the future to continue to provide staff with the IT equipment and services needed to carry out their work. 42 California Board of Accountancy 2450 Venture Oaks Way, Suite 300, Sacramento, /19 /15 /29 /16 Report Boards & Commissions Update New Appointee: Elizabeth Stuart, CPA beginning 3/1/22 One CPA seat currently vacant; anyone interested should apply with Boards & Commissions: https://gov.alaska.gov/services/boards -and-commissions/apply -for-a- board -appointment/ CPA Renewal Online renewal c losed December 31st .

BE INFORMED: IF NOT YOU, THEN WHO? As soon as possible before legislative season, select on the record a member who will serve as the p oint person fo r legislative activity. In the a bsence of this person, the division will l ook to the chair o f the board for input and interpretation. If the board is championing a piece of legislation, a history of the meeting minutes reflecting the issues and board's perspective should be compiled by this leader a nd made a vailable to board members and division management , who will be at every hearing. This research and history will be especially helpful to new board members who are appointed. When a bill is filed, division management will alert program staff. The examiner or executive should ensure that their board members are made aware of legislation that is filed that will affect them. With sometimes more than 50 bills to track, analyze, and testify on, div ision management m ay not be able to keep the board a pprised o f every l ate- breaking detail. Division management will periodically send updates to staff regarding legislation or request discussion with the board.

GUID ELINES FOR BOARD MEMBER TESTIMONY Encourage the board to become engaged: Track the bill online, participate in hearings, write a letter supporting the board's official position, and discuss the l egislation in a public meeting. It is a best practice for organizations to speak with \"one voice.\" Any testimony or correspondence by a board member on behalf of a board must represent deliberation and action taken on the record in a public meeting. Staff may not express opinions on behalf of the board or discuss legislation with elected officials without prior arrangements wi th division management and clearance from the Governor's Legislative Office. If the board has published a resolution or letter regarding the l egislation as a result of a vote at a public meeting, staff may provide that document to l egislators per department procedures. Individual board members may offer their personal or professional opinions on the legislation. They must clearly state that while they are appointed to a board, they do not speak on behalf of the board. Boards must provide a member to testify telephonically (or i n person, if i n Juneau) at every hearing when being considered for reauthorization per AS 08.03. Without member interest and advocacy for the board or commission's continuation, it is possible that the sponsor could withdraw the bill and the board could sunset. The chair or elected board spokesperson should be prepared to answer questions posed by staff or legislators, testify t elephonically (or in person, if in Juneau) on bills that require subject matter expertise or upon request, and otherwise be available on short notice to engage in this process or assign another board member to do so. Be sure to differentiate the state l icensing board from the industry association. S ometimes, they share the same goals. Sometimes, they do not. Legislators must keep track of a lot of names and organizations, so be sure that you are clear that you represent the State of Alaska licensing board. Nervous ? Don't worry! Please email or call the division director or deputy director to discuss tips or even run through some potential questions /rolepl ay. LEGISLATIVE TESTIMONY CALL-IN DO'S AND DON 'TS * For the 2022 session, masks are required in the Capitol . Do remember this \"off-n et\" system is designed to serve those who do not have any other way to testify or have a legitimate reason for using the system. Do remember that off-net calls to the committee must be authorized prior to the meeting by the chairman. A minimum of 24 hours in advance i s appreciated. Please work through the Director, Division Operations Manager, or the committee chairman's office for authorization. Do use the streaming video available at http://akl.tv/ to watch for your bill to come up. The chairman will announce the order of bills at the beginning of the meeting. Callers may be disconnected from the meeting if they call in prior to their bill being taken up. If video streaming is not an option for you, please contact the committee aide to make arrangements to call in early. Once the bill is before the committee, call 844-586-9085, let the operator know what committee you are calling for, give your name, state board position/affiliation, bill number, whether you wish to testify or to be available only to answer questions. Examples: \"Hi, I'm calling in to be available for questions on SB21 in Senate Finance. My name is Richard Wein, and I am the chair of the State Medical Board.\" \"Good morning. My name is Danette Schloeder, I am the chair of the Board of Nursing, and I'm on the list to provide invited testimony on HB83 in House Labor and Commerce.\" Do Not call in before the bill you are testifying on comes before the committee. Do remember the off net call-in lines are for testifiers only. If you wish to li sten in, please use the live streaming at http://akl.tv/. Do use the \"mute\" function of your phone until called on to testify. If this function is not available on your phone, ask the Legislative Information Office (LIO) moderator to mute your call. Do Not use the \"hold\" function. Do try to be in a quiet room without distractions or interruptions. Car noise, open windows, and barking dogs can all be heard by the legislative committee and guests at the hearing. These avoidable disturbances will detract from the credibility of your message. Please treat the important responsibility of testifying with utmost respect and professionalism. Do remember that everything transmitted over your phone will be broadcast directly into the meeting room and recorded to become part of the permanent record. Do remember to be in a l ocation with good reception if using a cell pho ne. Disruptions coming into the meeting via the phone lines will result in all callers being disconnected from the system. This will require testifiers to call back to be reconnected. Turn off your computer or TV speakers i f listening online so you do not create an audio \"loop.\" Do try to adhere to time limits i mposed by the chairman. Remember : There are a limited number of phone lines coming into the Capitol. Thes e lines are also used by LIOs around the state. When all the phone lines are used up, an LIO may not be able to call in with a room full of people. Register , 2022 PROFESSIONAL REGULATIONS DOL File#2021200453 (Part 2) 1 C hapter 04.

The purpose of this memo is to ensure board members are aware of and understand these requirements so they can adopt regulations and implement processes, if necessary, to comply with these requirements. Since the earliest military spouse licensing provisions of AS 08.02.063 went into effect in 2011, and military personnel licensing provisions of AS 08.01.064 and AS 08.01.100 went into effect in 2013, only a few boards have executed the legislature's intent. The Board of Examiners i n Optometry , the State Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy Board, and the Board of Dental Examiners have each addressed matters arising from individual applications from military personnel. At the request of a board member who is a military veteran, the Board of Nursing has formed a committee to \"crosswalk\" military experience and education to align with existing license type s and to explore options to bridge education gaps that may exist. In recent years, the plight of military servicemembers and the ir spouses has gained national attention among state regulators and military communities within their jurisdiction s. The U.S. Department of Defense has shined an unflattering light on how Alaska has handled military licensing transfers \u2014just as Eielson AFB expanded to welcome thousands of new servicemembers and their families. In addition, a 2018 memo from the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force sent a clear message about their expectations and the economic p ressure they intended to apply on states : \"While focus on the mission is always our priority, the factors military families cite most frequently as drawbacks to military service include military dependent's difficulty assimilating into local school systems following a duty station transfer, the quality of schools available for their children, and the ability of spouses to obtain jobs and sustain careers. With that in mind, we will encourage leadership to consider the quality of schools near bases and whether reciprocity of professional licenses is available for military families when evaluating future basing or mission alternatives.\" Various reports on this issue have been published in the last few years: although sources rang e from the Department of Defense to the National Governors Association to both the Obama and Trump Administrations , the need for military -friendly licensing policies is universally agreed -upon. The information below and attached should assist boards in review and determination of next s teps to reach compliance with the legislature's statutory expectations. I encourage boards to take the following steps to move forward on this project: 1. Board chairs review and/or assign a member to begin analysis and draft motions to come into compliance. Preparing ahead of time will help the meeting be more productive . 2. Schedule time during the next meeting to review this information and plan the next steps required. 3. Propose and adopt regulations regarding: a. Application processes, b. Practice limitations based on Alaska -specific requirements (such as Arctic engineering), c. What the board deems \"substantially equivalent,\" if necessary, d. Other relevant matters. Consistent with AS 08.01. 063(g), the division has maintained a military -specific web page , email address, and coordinator since 2014. Later this year, Records and Licensing Supervisor Terry Ryals will take over coordination of all military lic ensing matters . In addition to his role managing several CBPL programs, h e is an Army veteran and advocate for military families. CBPL Information Systems Coordinator Chelsea Childress , is leading the technical implementation of new licensing forms, structures, and workflow related to these changes. Our team looks forward to assisting your board in the successful roll -out of this legislation.
