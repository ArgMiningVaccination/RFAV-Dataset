Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 21 of 137 ADM ISSION Minimum Requirements for Admission All applicants must possess a high school diploma, a high school diploma equivalency, a current Tennessee license in the field for which the training is intended, or postsecondary credit in a degree program. If the applicant has a post-second ary degree (i.e., Associate's, Bachelor's or Master's), a copy of it may be submitted in lieu of a copy of the high school diploma. A physical copy of the original diploma (or its equivalent) or degree must be verified and on file no later than 30 days after classes commence. The evidence of graduation must include the name of the institution, city, state, and graduation year, and that the institution or program was approved by the applicable governing or state authority. VUMC periodically verifies that the institution or program was approved by the applicable governing or state authority. A signed, VUMC-approved attestation will be accepted in lieu of a copy of the high school diploma. Applicants should speak with the director of the program to which they are applying for more information. Some programs may have additional education requirements for admission. Please check the relevant program section in this catalog for additional information. For programs requiring college degree, a physical copy of the original college or university diploma or its equivalent must be provided, including the name of the institution, city, state and graduation year. For programs requiring a college degree, the college diploma satisfies documentation requirements of a high school education (copy of high school diploma does not need to be submitted). All students admitted into VUMC programs are required to undergo a criminal background check report prior to matriculation. Applicants are made aware on the application signature page that their VUMC enrollment is conditional upon passing a criminal background chec k, and instructions regarding the process of obtaining the background check are included in the student's letter of admission. VUMC requires that criminal background c heck reports be delivered by the screening provider directly to VUMC. VUMC will not accept background c heck reports from students. Programs may require additional screening, such as fingerprinting and drug screening. Information for any additional required screenings is provided by programs to students at the time of admission. A criminal record will jeopardize a graduate's eligibility for employment; therefore, students are advised to review any criminal record concerns with the relevant Program Director prior to deciding to apply. In the event an adverse criminal history report is returned, it is reviewed by the Program Director and the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health. The VUMC Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs may also be consulted. Decisions regarding non-admission of students deemed un fit due to the information in criminal background reports are final. Late Enrollment Vanderbilt Univ ersity Medical Center does not allow late enrollment. Admission/Application Procedures Each program establishes its own admission and application procedures. Please refer to the program- specific admission and application procedures in this Catalog. Program Requirements for Admission Specific requirements for admission are listed under each program offered. Please refer to program- specific admissions requirements in this Catalog. Blended Programs' Admission Requirements (Distance Education) Students applying for blended programs are assessed to ensure they have the appropriate skills and abilities necessary to succeed in the distance education componen ts of these programs. This assessment Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 22 of 137 is administered through Smarter Measure and does not take place until a student is admitted into the program. The assessment is related to the student experience with online learning management systems, in general, as well as general computer and internet experience. Only students who are deemed competent with online systems will be admitted to these programs. Experience with VUMC- specific systems is not a requirement, and training in the VUMC Learning Management System is provided early in the student's educational program.

Health Insurance All Center for Programs in Allied Health students are required to be covered by health insurance during their training. VUMC does not offer a student health insurance policy. Students may seek out private health care insurance options or enroll via a government health care exchange. The student must maintain his/her insurance through his/her tenure in the program and must provide proof of insurance (copy of health insurance card or letter from insurer) during new student orientation to the program and annu ally while enrolled as a student at VUMC. Immunization and Health Records Upon a cceptance, students must provide written documentation of the following: Two (2) negative TB skin tests within the past twelve (12) months with the most recent being within the past three (3) months. If history of a positive skin test is present, a chest x-ray within the past six (6) months will be necessary. If born on or after January 1, 195 7: Two (2) live measles vaccinations after the first birthday at least one month apart OR MMR vaccination since 1989 OR laboratory evidence of immunity to rubeola. Those born in 1957 or later need two immunizations for measles, like the MMR (at least one month apart, given after first birthday). Alternatively, docu mentation of a positive IgG blood test for measles will satisfy this requirement. Labo ratory evidence of MMR vaccination or immunity to mumps. Labo ratory evidence of immunity to varicella (chickenpox) or immunization series. Hepatitis B immunization (series of 3 injections), immunization series in progress or informed refusal of immunization. Tetanus/Diphtheria booster within the past 10 years is recommended, but not required. Any student with clinical activities in the Children's Hospital (including MCJCHV clinics), Women's Health, and Emergency (including LifeFlight) is required to have documentation of one booster dose of pertussis vaccine in the form of Tdap. Routine adult Td boosters and the childhood DTP/DTaP vaccines do not satisfy this requirement. All students are required to receive the influenza vaccine by December 1st of each year. Students may apply for exemption from the influenza vaccine for religious or health reasons. Readmission Policy Students dismissed from a VUMC program may be considered for readmission at VUMC on a case-by- case basis. Students must apply for admission consideration, and the entire application and selection process must be carried out. Students applying for readmission may be asked to interview with the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health. A student may be readmitted to VUMC no more than one time. Reapp lying students may be required to repeat coursework taken du ring a previous period of study at VUMC. The eligibility of coursework previously completed at VUMC to be applied toward graduation requirements following readmission will be determined on an individual basis, and the decision will be based on the following: Length of absence Reason for withdrawal (personal, illness, academic, etc.) Performance in program-recommended /required remediation, if any, during original period of enrollment Whether or not the student was in good academic standing when the withdrawal took place Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 26 of 137 Didactic courses previously completed at VUMC will be considered for credit toward certificate gradua tion requirements per the VUMC Transfer of Clock Hours or Credit to VUMC Policy. Students may be tested to determine continued mastery of knowledge previously covered in cou rses. No credit for prior clinical courses, internships, labs or practica is given. Those requirements must be taken regardless of the circumstances of the student withdrawal. Employment Requirements in Allied Health Fields In Allied Health fields, states and employers may require licensure, certification, registration, etc., before an individual may be employed in a given field. Licensure eligibility and other requirements vary from state to state. Students are advised to check licensure and certification guidelines for the states in which they plan to seek employment. Transfer of Clock Hours or Credit to VUMC VUMC evaluates for transfer credit all clock hours and/or credit earned at institutions accredited by organizations recognized by the U.S. Department of Education or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). Credits earned at other educational institutions are reviewed by VUMC and may or may not be accepted by VUMC as credit toward VUMC programs' graduation requirements. It is the responsibility of prospective students to clearly understand which credits earned at other institutions will and will not be accepted by VUMC before executing an enrollment agreement with VUMC. Clock hour or credit transfer requests must be made by the student in writing during the admissions process. Official evaluation of a collegiate transcript is cond ucted upon receipt of an official transcript directly from the institution at which the courses under consideration were earned. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that VUMC receives all official transcripts. An official transcript must be provided from each institution from which credit and/or clock hours are to be transferred. Transcripts provided become the property of VUMC. Up to 25% of program clock hours and/or credit may be accepted for transfer, depending on the determination of equivalency. Only hours or credits for which a grade of C or better was awarded and that were earned within the past five years are eligible for transfer consideration. VUMC may ask the student to provide additional documentation to establish coursework completed, and VUMC may require testing and/or demonstration of skills in order to verify student competency related to requested transfer credit/clock hours. Advanced Placement and Experiential Learning VUMC does not accept hours toward advanced placement through cha llenge examinations, achievement tests, or experiential learning. Transfer of Credits or Clock Hours to Other Institutions Transferability of credits varies considerably from institution to institution. Vanderbilt University Medical Center makes no representation whatsoever regarding transfer or acceptance of VUMC credits by any other institution. Vanderbilt University Medical Center does not guarantee the transferability of its credits to any other institution unless there is a written agreement with another institution explicitly denoting transferability. Transferability of Credit Disclosure You should also contact any educa tional institutions that you may want to transfer credits earned at VUMC to determine if such institutions will accept credits earned at VUMC prior to executing an enrollment contract or agreement. It is highly recommended, and you are advised, to consult with all educ ational institutions in which you co nsider transferring credit earned at VUMC before you ex ecute an enrollment contract or agreement. Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 27 of 137 GRADU ATION REQUIREMENTS Certificates for each VUMC program are awarded based on the successful completion of all graduation requirements for each program. Details regarding each program's graduation requirements are provided in the program-specific section of this catalog. All programs require students to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress, the standards for which are outlined in this Catalog. All students are required by VUMC to complete an exit interview prior to graduation. A lso, in order to gradua te, students must have no outstanding financial balance with VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health (this does not include educational loans to third-party lenders). SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS (QUALITATIVE AND QUAN TITATIVE ELEMENTS) All VUMC Students are required to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). SAP is a measure that consists of both qualitative (e.g., grades) and quantitative (e.g., number of hours completed in the clinical setting) measurements. Both measurements are evaluated on a regular basis for each program. Details about the timing and frequency of SAP review for each program a re contained in the program- specific sections of this catalog. Each program's SAP requirements are also stated within each program section of this catalog. In order to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress, a student must meet at all times the minimum standards established by each program for both qualitative and quantitative measures. This VUMC Satisfactory Acade mic Progress policy applies to all VUMC students. These standards are consistently applied by each program to its students, regardless of financial aid status. In order to graduate, a student must successfully complete all courses in the program with the designated minimum score for passing (which varies from program to program). Qualitative Elements of SAP Qualitative Elements of SAP - General Information - Qualitative measurement consists of a student's grades, whether expressed numerically or with letter grades (see Grading Scale chart below). Some programs may calculate these grades into a cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA). Some courses may be graded according to the pass/fail system. Some programs use competency-based assessment as a qualitative measure in addition to a grading scale. In these cases student performance of competency- related tasks is assessed in order to determine whether or not a student has obtained competency (pass) or not (fail). Each program-specific section of this catalog provides additional details regarding each program's qualitative measurement. Qualitative Elements of SAP -- Grading Scale* Scale Grade Definition GPA 100-90% A Excellent 4.0 89-80% B Good 3.0 79-70% C Satisfactory 2.0 69-0%** F Inadequa te** 0.0 P Pass - Any course with a \"P\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. F Fail - Any course with an \"F\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. However, the course must be repeated and passed to gradua te. Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 28 of 137 I Incomplete - May be used at the discretion of the instructor in those cases in which the student is not able to complete work in the normal time. In those instances, the student and instructor develop a written plan for an extension to provide work by a specific date that falls within the period of time specified by the relevant program's requirements (but in no circumstances greater than one month). An \"I\" that is not replaced by a letter grade within the period of time specified by the relevant program's requirements, due to unsatisfactory completion of the student's plan, will be changed to an F after the period specified by the program (a period not to exc eed one month). Any course with an \"I\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. Once a grade is assigned to the course (when con ditions are met that allow for the removal of the \"I\" and a ssignment of a final grade), that grade will factor into the student's GPA. W\u00b1 Withdrawal - Utilized when a student leaves the course due to an approved leave-of-absence or withdraws from the school prior to the sched uled completion of a course. Any course with a \"W\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. R Repeat - Some programs allow students to repeat courses. In those programs, for any course that is repeated, a Repeat will be provided as the grade for the first attempt at the course. Any course with an \"R\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. However, cou rses will be considered hours / credit hours attempted for the purpose of determining maximum time frame. Please refer to each program's student handbook for information abo ut whether students are allowed to repeat courses in any given program. *Programs may, at their discretion, subdivide each grade into categories indicating plus (+) or minus (-) performance for a given grade level on the grading scale (e.g., A-, B+, C+, etc.). Individual program sections of this catalog contain information on program-specific grading systems. **Programs may, at their discretion, establish a failing grade threshold higher than the institutional minimum failing grade as indicated above (69 and lower). Individual program grading sections in this catalog provide program-specific information on failing grade thresholds. Under no circumstances may a program establish a failing grade threshold lower than the institutional threshold grade (69 and lower). All programs must apply and enforce their failing grade thresholds uniformly among students enrolled in the program. \u00b1 Non-punitive grades for courses awarded by the school include \"W\". Non-punitive grades are not included in the computation of a student's overall Cumulative Grade or Point Average. The clock hours or credit hours associated with any courses for which non-punitive grades are assigned a re included as credits attempted when calculating the student's Maximum Time Frame and c redit completion percentage. Qualitative Elements of SAP -- Minimum Average Required for Satisfactory Academic Progress - All students must maintain a minimum qualitative average (expressed as percentage points, grades, GPA and/or competencies passed) as defined by each program in order to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. Students must achieve the minimum qualitative average at each review of SAP to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. Students not maintaining SAP will face remedial action, up to and including dismissal from the program. The table below presents the minimum qualitative average required for each program. More detailed information is available in the program-specific section of this catalog for each program. Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 29 of 137 Program Name Term 1 Term 2 Term 3 Term 4 Dietetic Internship 70% average (rotations & assignments) 80% average (rotations & assignments) Medical Laboratory Science 75% average 75% average Diagnostic Medical Sonography 75% average 75% 75% 75% 75% course per course Neurodiagnostic Technology 70% average 70% average 70% average 70% average Students not completing required coursework or hours will be assigned a failing grade for the course. Additional adverse actions may also arise from not completing required co ursework or hours. Non-Credit / Remedial Courses / Proficiency Credit - VUMC does not offer non-credit or remedial courses, or grant proficiency credit. Student Grievance Concerning Grades - Students should seek redress of a problem with a grade as soon as possible after receiving the grade and in no case later than one (1) week after the grade is released. Students should confer directly with the course director about grade concerns. Every effort should be made to resolve the problem fairly and promptly at this level. If the student cannot resolve the problem through discussion with the course director, the student should formally request an appeal from the Program Director within one (1) week of talking with the course director. If the Program Director is the course director in question, the appeal should be made to the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health. The decision of any appeal is final. Quantitative Elements of SAP For all programs, the quantitative measurement of SAP consists of a student's satisfactory completion of program hours, based on a rate-of-progress calculation. The rate of progress calculation is the percentage of total hours completed of those hours the student has attempted. This measurement ensures that all students progress at a rate sufficient to allow them to complete their programs within the maximum time allowed. Each program establishes a number of hours to be attempted and a number required to be completed in order for the student to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. More information is available in each program's section in this catalog, but an outline of program requirements is presented in the following table. Students' progress against quantitative SAP requirements is measured at least once a term. There are two institutional terms per academic year. The first term is defined as the period between July 1 and December 31. The second term is defined as the period between January 1 and June 30. Sc hedules for Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 30 of 137 each program's rotations and other program elements may have different starting and e nding dates from the institutional term dates. Transfer and Readmitted Students/Students Changing Majors If a student transfers to VUMC from another postsecondary institution, the transfer credits that were accepted by VUMC will count as credits attempted and credits completed for purposes of calculating the student's quantitative progress. The corresponding grades will not count toward the student's qualitative progress. If a student is re-admitted into VUMC, changes program of study, or seeks to earn an a dditional credential, the credits that are applicable to the student's current program of study will be included in determining the student's satisfactory academic progress standing and the appropriate evaluation level for the student in terms of establishing the total number of credits attempted and completed at each of the student's evaluation periods. Students receiving federal financial aid may repeat a course in accordance with the VUMC academic policy. Credits from both course attempts will be counted in total credits attempted and in minimum cumulative credits completed at VUMC, but only the highest grade earned will be included in the calculation of minimum cumulative GPA. Credits from both cou rse attempts will also count towards the Maximum Time Frame for Completion. Students may receive financial aid for each repeated course provided that a student may not repeat a passed course more than o nce. Progress Evaluations and Reports Each student's progress in completing the program is reviewed du ring a progress evaluation monthly. During these reviews the student's Cumulative Grade (or Point) Average and rate of progress in completing program hours are discussed with the student, and the student receives academic, attendance and/or financial aid advising from the school, as the school deems necessary. Students will receive a written progress report containing a summary of the student's grades and successfully completed hours. Students are notified in writing should they fail to meet the minimum standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress during an evaluation period/term. Students who fail to maintain SAP in an evaluation period are placed on SAP Warning, unless there are two or fewer terms left in the program following the term for which the evaluation is provided, in which case the student will be placed on Academic Probation. More information on Academic Probation is contained in the Academic Probation section of this catalog. SAP Wa rning: Each program establishes a timeframe for its SAP warning period, but in no case does a SAP Warning Period last more than one term. Student loan funds may be disbursed during SAP Warning periods. When placed on SAP Wa rning, students are provided n otification in writing that outlines the reasons why the student has been placed on SAP Warning and the requirements the student must meet in order to be removed from SAP Wa rning (an \"Academic Plan\"). The Academic Plan is designed to bring the student into compliance with Satisfactory Academic Progress standards within a single term. The student's Academic Plan and progress toward its completion will be reviewed with the student during the period of SAP Warning according to the details of the Plan. At the end of the Warning period, if the minimum standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress are not met a student will be placed on Academic Probation. Students who satisfy the conditions of Satisfactory Academic Progress at the end of the Warning period will be returned to Satisfactory Academic Progress status. School personnel, including the appropriate instructor, the Program Director, the Assistant Program Director, and/or the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health are available to discuss any conc erns students may have. Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 31 of 137 Academic Probation Students failing to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress as defined by their program may, at the discretion of the program, be placed on academic probation. When placed on academic probation, students are provided written notification that outlines the reasons why the student has been placed on probation and the requirements the student must meet in order to be removed from probation (an \"Academic Plan\"). The Academic Plan is designed to bring the student into compliance with Satisfactory Academic Progress standards within a designated period of time as defined by the Program Director in the Academic Plan. The student's Academic Plan and progress toward its completion will be reviewed with the student during the period of Probation according to the details of the Plan. Students are not allowed to have more than one period of probation while enrolled in their program. Students on probation who do not successfully complete the terms of their Academic Plan will be provided the opportunity to withdraw. If the student refuses to withdraw, he or she will be dismissed from the program. Studen ts on probation who successfully complete the terms of their Academic Plan will return to Satisfactory Academic Progress standing, and academic probation status will be removed. Academic Probation Appeal - Students who have been placed on academic probation may appe al the probation decision. To do so, the student must submit an appeal request to the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health in writing (email is acceptable) within five (5) working days of being placed on probation. The appeal request must include: Information about the circumstances or events that prevented the student from maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress, and What has changed in the student's situation to allow the student to be successful in the future. The student may submit documentation along with the appeal request. The Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health will review the appeal and any documentation submitted by the student. The Director will also speak with involved faculty and staff. The student will be notified of the outcome of the appe al in writing within five (5) business days of the appeal submission. The decision of the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health is final. If the appe al is not successful, probation status will continue until 1) the student meets the requirements of the Academic Plan and returns to Satisfactory Academic Progress status, or 2) the student fails to meet the requirements of the Academic Plan and subsequently withdraws or is dismissed from the program. If the appe al is successful, the student will not be placed on probation, but the program may impose requirements the student must complete in order to return to Satisfactory Academic Progress. Student Dismissal Policy Students who have been placed on probation and do n ot return to Satisfactory Academic Progress status within the time required by their Academic Plan will be given the opportunity to withdraw or be dismissed from the program. Studen ts may also be dismissed from the program after a period of temporary suspension. Students dismissed from VUMC programs are required to immediately return to VUMC their student IDs and any books, equ ipment or other materials issued to them by VUMC. VUMC programs pursue dismissal only after a student has been given a reasonable period of warning and/or probation to address deficiencies. Dismissal may also be recommended at any time for a student who de monstrates either a singular egregious behavior or is involved in one or more serious incidents inconsistent with the expectations for students of VUMC, or in violation of VUMC policy. A decision to pursue dismissal requires participation of the program director and relevant program faculty and ad ministrators. The Program Director will meet with the student to hear the student's explanation, including any mitigating circumstances in the situation. The Program Director will then meet with relevant program faculty and administrators to consider factors in the situation and render a determination. The dismissal decision is described in a notice to the student written by the Program Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 32 of 137 Director. This communication is presented to the student, in person whenever possible, by the Program Director, although an in-person meeting may not be possible in all cases. Student Dismissal Appeal - A student who is dismissed from a VUMC program has the right to appeal. Each appeal is decided on an individual basis. The process for appealing a dismissal decision is as follows: The student must submit a written appeal to the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health. The appeal must be submitted at least one month prior to the start of the term in which the student wishes to be granted entrance into the program. Appeals must include a detailed explanation of the circumstances related to the dismissal. As relevant, such appeals should include official/professional documentation (i.e. medical records, court documents, or any other documentation which would support an appeal). The appeal will be reviewed by the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health, and approved or denied based on the student's individual circumstances, past academic record, and potential to successfully complete the program. The Program Director will provide a written decision to the student within fourteen (14) business days. The decision on the dismissal appeal is final. If the student is allowed to re-enroll, the Program Director may place conditions that the student must meet in order to be reinstated. The Program Director may also reinstate the student on a probationary basis. Reinstatement is based on class and space availability. If studen ts who are reinstated are required to repeat coursework, that coursework must be satisfactorily completed in order to continue in the program. Reinstated students must maintain VUMC student accounts in good standing and may not default on any loan. VUMC reserves the right to terminate a student's enrollment if, during the student's program of study, VUMC determines that the student has failed to maintain the minimum standards of satisfactory academic progress, or has reached the maximum timeframe (150% of the program credits/hours) without successfully completing the program; failed to comply with the VUMC rules and regulations as published in VUMC's Catalog; or has failed to meet his or her financial obligations. Any refund due to the student or other agencies will be calculated and refunded according to the Tuition Refund Policy. A student who has been dismissed for failure to maintain SAP may reapply for admission; however, until SAP status is re-established, the student will not be eligible for any form of federal financial aid. A student making application for re-admission must first satisfy all current requirements for admission. In addition, if a student's enrollment was terminated for failure to maintain SAP, the applicant's academic records will be evaluated to determine if it is possible for a satisfactory cumulative grade point average to be achieved and if the program can be completed within the maximum time frame. Temporary Student Suspension VUMC reserves the right to temporarily suspend a student for conduct disrupting or otherwise negatively affecting the learning environment, pen ding consideration of the student's situation by the Program Director and other relevant program faculty and a dministrators. The Program Director will notify the student in writing of the conditions of the temporary suspension. If the student is reinstated, the student will work with the Program Director to address any course work missed during the suspension. Maximum Time to Complete Program - All students are expected to complete their program of study within an acceptable period of time, as defined by each program, but in no case to exceed 150% of normal Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 33 of 137 program length. Students failing to complete their program of study within the maximum time will be dismissed from the program. These students are not eligible for reinstatement. Time spent in any of the following situations/activities counts toward the maximum time to complete VUMC programs: Courses for which a grade of incomplete or failure was recorded Courses from which the student withdrew Repeated coursework (e.g., following prior failure of the course) Time in a VUMC-approved leave-of-absence. PROGRAM DELIVERY Programs may be offered in the traditional in-resident format, or in a blended distance education format. Programs and co urses presented in this catalog may indicate either residential or blended delivery format. Courses may use a combination of lecture, clinical activities, simulation, lab activities, and out-of-class assignments. Courses may be graded by in-class assignments, out-of-class assignments, quizzes, projects, written examinations and practical evaluation of techniques. Students in blended distance education cou rses should also expect to post to threaded discussions and submit written or weekly assignments electronically. Residential Format Students physically attend class for the scheduled hours and complete outside preparation as required. Please see program requirements in the program section of this catalog or in the Program Handbook for additional information ab out participation and attendance requirements. Blended Distance Education format The Blended Distance Education format courses may consist of both classroom and o nline instruction.

Fee dback from current students and graduates is critical to understanding the Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 35 of 137 performance of the institution and the programs. Students and graduates are encouraged to participate in these surveys, given the importance of this feedback. Surveys of students and graduates include at least: Course evaluations (administered by programs following conc lusion of courses) Student satisfaction survey (administered by VUMC at least once a year) Graduate satisfaction survey (administered by VUMC at least once a year) Program-specific surveys of students (details are available in each program's Program Handboo k) Attendance Attendance is an essential component of success in VUMC programs. Students enrolled at the institution make a commitment to participate fully in their education by attending classes, clinical rotations, and other educational activities as required by their program of study, and a ccounting for any absences according to program policy. Each p rogram establishes its detailed tardiness, absence and make-up time policies and procedures. Please refer to the program-specific Program Handbook for more information. It is the student's responsibility to address any issues related to his/her attendance. A student has the option to determine with the course instructor (in consultation with the Program Director, if needed) whether and under what conditions make-up work will be permitted or required. All programs have processes to allow for absence in cases of emergency, of illness, of the death of a close relative, or when observing a religious holiday. See program-specific information in this catalog for further details. Each program has policies regarding unexcused consecutive absences and consequences for such, up to and including dismissal from the program. Leaves of Absence VUMC offers students the option to take a leave of absence from study at VUMC for medical, family or other reasons. Students must request the leave of absence in advance, except in emergency cases. The student must submit a written request to Program Director, indicating the beginning and ending dates of the leave. Additional documentation to support the request may be required (e.g., medical records, legal records). Each student's request is evaluated on an individual, case-by-case basis. A student may be granted a leave of absence not to exceed a total of 180 calendar days in a 12-month period. Students may take no more than one leave of absence while enrolled in a VUMC program. Time spent in a VUMC-approved leave-of-absence counts toward the maximum allowable time to complete any VUMC program. Exceptions cannot be made to each program's maximum time for completion (150% of normal program length) for student leave-of-absence or for any other reason. Academic plans are developed to accommodate students' needs upon returning from leave of absence. At the discretion of the Program Director, students returning from a leave of absence may be required to complete coursework in a different academic year than the one in which they matriculated. Students may be required to present medical documentation in order to return from medical leave-of-absence. If a student does not return on the documented return date he/she may be dismissed from the program. Students who are eligible to register in the term following the leave but do not do so may be unen rolled and may be required to re-apply to the program. Programs may require students to complete some or all coursework, clinical rotations and other educational activities. Time spent in leave-of-absence counts toward the maximum time allowed to complete VUMC programs. It is the student's responsibility to be aware of these limits for the program in which the student is enrolled.

Among the hazards that a student may be expo sed to are: Housekeeping and/or cleaning agents Flammable and/or explosive chemicals and gases Electrical or mechanical equipment Fumes Radiation Blood-borne pathogens Students will be instructed in the use of infection control and standard precautions, as well as safety in the workplace. If exposure or injury does occur during scheduled clinical education time, the student should follow the documented procedure for treatment. 1. Report the exposure/injury to the supervising staff IMMEDIATELY . 2. Take appropriate first aid measures (clean wound with soap/water; flush mucous membranes with water/saline for 15 minutes). If life-threatening, see Emergency Department (ED) physician immediately. If non-life threatening, seek treatment at the Occupational Health Clinic in the Medical Arts Building.

Any identified incident found not to be reported may result in disciplinary action, up to or including dismissal from the program. Infection Control for Patients During their normal program activities students will encounter patients who are in an immunosuppressed condition, p utting these patients at a particularly high risk of contracting infectious diseases, including a cold, influenza and other communicable diseases. To some patients such an infection could be life- threatening. Because of this, if a student suspects he or she has acquired (or if he or she has been diagnosed with) an infectious condition, the student is prohibited from the clinical setting. This is absolutely essential in order to protect patients from infection by ill students. Any infectious condition should be reported by the student to the Program Director as soon as possible. Any student found to be withholding this type of information will face disciplinary action for unethical behavior. A clinical instructor who suspects that a student may be infectious may ask the student to leave the clinical setting and will notify the Program Director. After absence due to infectious disease, the student must be evaluated by a physician, and written permission from his/her physician must be obtained before returning to the clinical setting.

In those instances, the student and instructor develop a written plan for an extension to provide work by a specific date that falls within the period of time specified by the program's requirements. An \"I\" that is not replaced by a letter grade within the period of time specified by the relevant program's requirements, will be chan ged to an F after the period specified by the program (a period not to exceed one month). W A Withdrawal is provided when a student leaves the course due to an approved leave-of-absence or is withdrawn from the school prior to the scheduled completion of a course. Each course syllabus clearly delineates how final grades are calculated. Students who do not complete required work or hours in a course will be assigned a failing grade for t h e course. Letter grades are assigned and 'clock hours' recorded on final transcripts. Because the certificate program does not grant credits, Grade Point Averages (GPAs) are not calculated. Student Clinical Assessment The DMS Program Clinical Education Plan guides student clinical assessment, and is divided into the following two (2) sections of required clinical performance evaluations: 1. Technical Competencies - These are unique skill sets, outlined in the DMS Program Technical Competencies Plan, which appe ars in the DMS Program Handboo k. The technical competencies provide a pathway for progressive skill development from basic patient care and Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 66 of 137 portions of abdominal, gynecological, and obstetrical exams to complete exams and advanced imaging skills. Each technical competency must be practiced multiple times during the student's time in the program, with observation and rating by credentialed clinical staff (preceptors). Variable levels of assistance by the preceptor are permitted, but students must meet the minimum requirements of competence, as described in the Technical Evaluation Criteria table, which also appears in the Program Handboo k. Specific deadlines for successfully completing the required number of technical competencies are specified in each clinical syllabus. 2. Technical Competency Challenges - In addition to achieving the required technical competencies as described above, the student is required to pass Technical Competency Challenges during each clinical practicum in order to document progressive entry level skill development and complete satisfactory clinical requirements. Technical Competency Challenge requirements are described in the DMS Program Handboo k. Technical Competency Challenges may be performed only after 70% of assigned Technical Competencies are satisfactorily completed. Technical Competency Challenges may only be completed with designated, appropriately credentialed clinical staff (Clinical Instructors). Minimal levels of assistance are permitted (as described in the Technical Evaluation Criteria table). Student who are not successful in completing a Technical Competency Challenge must complete additional repetitions of one or more competencies and con sult with the program director before he or she may repeat the Technical Competency Challenge. Two unsuccessful attempts at the same Technical Competency Challenge will result in the student being placed on SAP Warning, and the implementation of a written plan of action required for the student to return to satisfactory academic status. Timely performance of Technical Competency Challenges is required, and failure to meet Challenges by the dates specified in each clinical syllabus will affect Clinical course grades. Entry level skills and competence are determined in the last Rotation of clinical coursework through the Final Competency Assessment with designated, appropriately credentialed Clinical Instructors. Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy (SAP) A student is considered to be maintaining satisfactory academic progress if he/she 1) maintains a 75% acade mic average in all didactic and clinical courses throughout each curriculum Rotation (12 weeks); 2) maintains a satisfactory performance pace (completion of hours required) within the curriculum course sequence and clinical competency plan, per the course syllabi; and 3) complies with all program policies found in this catalog and in the Program Handbook. Performance will be monitored in an on- going manner throughout activities and a grade for each course assessed at the end of each Rotation. Graduation Requirements Students of the VUMC Diagnostic Medical Sonography Program are required to do the following in order to graduate with a Certificate in General Sono graphy: 1. Complete all didactic and clinical coursework in the Curriculum Plan with a grade of \"C\" or better as outlined in the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy. 2.

Submit documentation for a total of twelve (12) hours of approved professional development activities. Upon satisfaction of these requirements, each student is required to participate in an Exit Interview with the Program Director prior to the release of a certificate or transcript. Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 67 of 137 Student Conduct In add ition to the VUMC Code of Conduct, students in the Diagnostic Medical Sonography Program are bound by standards of conduct specific to their profession. Adherence to the VUMC Code of Conduct and the SDMS Professional Code of Ethics is required of students at all times. SDMS Professional Code of Ethics The Society of Diagnostic Medical Sono graphy (SDMS) was founded in 1970 to promote, ad vance, and educ ate its members and the medical community in the science of diagnostic medical sonography. The SDMS is a network of over 28,000 sonographers practicing in all specialty areas, sonography students, educ ators, physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers who practice or have an interest in diagnostic medical sonography. Code of Ethics for the Profession of Diagnostic Medical Sonography Re-approved by SDMS Board of Directors, February 18, 2017. PREA MBLE The goal of this code of ethics is to promote excellence in patient care by fostering responsibility and accou ntability among diagnostic medical sonographers. In so doing, the integrity of the profession of diagnostic medical sonography will be maintained. OBJECTIVES 1. To create and enco urage an environment where professional and ethical issues are discussed and addressed. 2. To help the individual diagnostic medical sonographer identify ethical issues. 3. To provide guidelines for individual diagnostic medical sonographers regarding ethical behavior. PRINCIPLES Principle I: In order to promote patient well-being, the diagnostic medical sonographer shall: A. Provide information to the patient about the purpose of the sonography procedure and respond to the patient's questions and concerns. B. Respect the patient's autonomy and the right to refuse the procedure. C. Recognize the patient's individuality and provide care in a non-judgmental and non- discriminatory manner. D.

Accurately represent his/her experience, ed ucation and credentialing. E. Promote equitable access to care. F. Collaborate with professional colleagues to create an environment that promotes communication and respect. G. Communicate and collaborate with others to promote ethical practice. H. Engage in ethical billing practices. I. Engage only in legal arrangements in the medical industry. J. Report deviations from the Code of Ethics to institutional leadership for internal sanctions, local intervention and/or criminal prosecution. The Code of Ethics can serve as a valuable tool to develop local policies and procedures. Source: \u00a9 Copyright 1999-2010. So Texas. https://www.sdms.org/about/who -we-are/code -of-ethics Other Program Policies Professional Progression, Career Advising Each student enrolled in the VUMC DMS Program has access to faculty and staff members for academic and p rofessional advising. The Program Director is the primary source for this type of student advising; however, the student may approach other faculty members, clinical instructors or staff of the VUMC Ultrasound and/or Radiology Department. Other Center for Programs in Allied Health staff members are also available by appointment to assist students as necessary. All official academic advising condu cted by program faculty and staff, and is documented and retained in the student's record. Employment Placement for Program Graduates The DMS Program's accreditor (CAA HEP) requires reporting of outcomes and achievement of designated outcomes pertaining to graduate placement in a related position of employment. The DMS Program assumes that all graduates desire to obtain employment within a relative short time beyond gradua tion (if a position is not secured prior to graduation). While VUMC does not guarantee employment offers or engage in job searches for students, Program Facu lty and Staff can offer assistance and ad vising related to searching for a position. There are numerous ways the program can ass ist a self- driven student to secure employment. These include, but are not limited to: Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 69 of 137 Notification to students about available positions Review and feedb ack on resume development Provide resources for conducting job searches Provide references and/or academic verification Since the DMS Program is required to report information on student employment placement to their accrediting bodies, graduates are asked to provide detailed information regarding employment. Necessary information will be requested at the Exit Interview. If the student has not yet obtained employment, he or she will be expected to provide the information as soon as it becomes available. VUMC will contact gradua tes regarding employment status in order to fulfill accreditation reporting requirements. Employment information (including changes) is needed by the program for the first 12 calendar months be yond gradua tion. Compliance with this request is necessary for outcomes docu mentation and d istribution of graduate Licensure The DMS Program's accreditor (CAA HEP) requires of program outcomes and achievement of des ignated benchmarks. Graduate credentialing rates are among the numerous outcomes assessed. CAAHE P requires reporting for all eligible specialties. The Program exhau sts all efforts to provide students with the information and resources necessary to be successful at professional credentialing exams. The ARDMS has transitioned over the past few years to permit students attending accredited programs the opportunity to apply and take these credentialing exams prior to graduation from the program. Wh ile a student may successfully complete the exams prior to graduation, the credential is not released until the Program Director indicates successful completion of the program (see Graduation Requirements). In order to earn the RDMS (Registered Diagnostic Medical Sono grapher) credential, one must successfully complete the Sonography Principles and Instrumentation (SPI) exam AND a corresponding Specialty exam (i.e., Abdomen, Obstetrics/Gynecology, etc.). VUMC is accredited as a General Sono graphy Program that deems its students eligible to apply for and earn the RDMS credential in Abdomen and Obstetrics/Gyneco logy. This credentialing process results in one (1) credential in two (2) specialties. These exams may be taken while still enrolled in the program under the following parameters: Sono graphy Principles and Instrumentation may be taken immediately upon satisfactory completion of the Physics coursework Specialty exams (Abdomen and Obstetrics/Gynecology) may be applied for and taken within the last sixty (60) days of the Academic Calendar While the DMS Program is required by its accreditors to achieve high rates of student credentialing, it is of utmost importance to the student that appropriate credentials are obtained in the search for employment. Few employers hire graduates prior to being credentialed, but they often offer employment with a condition of obtaining certain credentials. The Program Facu lty and Staff expect that VUMC students, as leaders in their field, pursue the full credentialing for which they are eligible prior to and upon graduation. Students are advised that while the DMS Program provides an introduction to the Vascular Technology specialty, the program does NOT have the clinical resources to ensure proficiency in the full spectrum of vascular examinations. However, with the foundation of knowledge gained at VUMC, many gradua tes have secured employment that provided the necessary additional training to prepare for the RVT (Registered Vascular Technologist) credential. A graduate can earn the RVT after gaining additional clinical training and e xperience, and subsequently successfully completing the Vascular Technology (VT) Spe cialty Exam. Additional details are available from the Program Director for those interested.

The 44-week Dietetic Internship, beginning in August each year, provides an opportunity for dietetic interns to gain a variety of clinical experiences at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, its affiliations and through field observations in the areas of food systems management, clinical dietetics and community nutrition. Such expe riences are planne d, guided and evaluated by the Internship Director, Educational Coordinator, dietitians and other professionals practicing in many areas of dietetics and healthcare who serve as both teachers and role models. The dietetic interns contribute to the overall excellence of nutrition care at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the affiliates by providing patient care and education, by providing stimulation to the staff and by engaging in projects that are beneficial to the institutions. With emphasis on edu cation, the program benefits the community by providing sound information on nutrition and health to the public.

Academic Program Program Sequence and Delivery Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 75 of 137 Dietetic Internship Program Sy llabus The Dietetic Internship Program Syllabus provides essential information about the learning activities that take place during the internship. Supplementing the syllabus are rotation specific competencies along with grading and evaluation criteria against which student performance will be assessed. Students are expected to review and be responsible for Syllabus content as much as they are for content in this catalog and in the Intern Program Handboo k. Graduation Requirements for the Dietetic Internship and Eligibility For Registration Examination Learning activities (in rotations, community events, professional development days and special projects) are planned to enable the dietetic intern to attain competence in the 41 Core Competencies for Dietitians and 3 Concentration Competencies in the areas of disease management / health promotion as outlined in the Standards of Education. The planned activities for each rotation, community event, professional development day and special project are minimum requirements for every intern. Experience and initiative of the intern will determine the objectives accomplished beyond the minimum. Additionally, interns must comply with the Code of Ethics of The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Dietetic Internship Honor Code. The minimum number of hours required to complete the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Dietetic Internship Program is 1,286. An exit interview is scheduled during summary week to summarize performance. A minimum overall average score of 80 and a score of 80 in each of the four core competency categories, case studies, entry level practice rotations, and conc entration area rotation must be achieved to meet requirements for receipt of a Verification Statement. Disease Management and Health Promotion entry-level practice rotations, concentration area rotation and case studies may not be repeated. Conferences may also be scheduled at any time by the staff or at the request of the dietetic intern. Student Assessment and Grading Student performance is assessed through the use of competencies. A detailed list of Core Competencies for Dietitians is provided in the handbook for the VUMC Dietetic Internship Program summative spr eadsheets . Studen ts should refer to these regularly and be familiar with them. The competencies used to assess student performance vary by activity and a ssignment, given that each activity requires different skills and abilities. As a result, the competency/objective/evaluation form used to assess students is unique to each rotation, but in all cases the form contains rotation-specific core competencies each intern is expe cted to achieve throughout individual rotations. Competency/Objective/Evaluation Form 1. The competency/objective/evaluation form is used to evaluate the intern's performance. After completing the rotation, the intern contacts the preceptor to schedule an evaluation con ference. Typically, the conference is held within 14 days of intern's completion of the rotation. The intern must sign this form after the formal evaluation conference with their preceptor and reviewing the written evaluation. During a rotation, periodic oral con ferences between interns and preceptors are also useful in determining the intern's progress. 2. The intern uses the professional development evaluation form for self -evaluation and to evaluate the learning experiences offered during the rotation. 3. After discussion, the intern and preceptor set goals for competencies or areas that need additional experience. These should then be recorded by the intern on the professional development form for upcoming rotation(s). 4. If neces sary, the Educational Coordinator or Internship Director is consulted to make necessary arrangements for additional or altered learning experiences. 5. The Internship staff then calculate overall scores for each rotation, utilizing scores from core competencies (60%) and overall performance rating (40%). These are recorded on the Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 76 of 137 summative evaluation form by the Internship staff and discussed at conferences throughout the semester and at mid-term and exit conferences. The Internship staff assimilates the evaluations to determine whether the intern has attained the competence required for entry-level practice. A numerical rating scale is used to rate minimum performance. Conferences with the Internship staff are scheduled throughout the semester and at mid-year to review each intern's progress and discuss educational experiences during the remainder of the program. Attendance Attendance is required and punctuality is expected for each rotation day, as well as for all class days, community events and conferences. Make-up time must be scheduled for all absences. If an intern misses: 50% of a core rotation OR One or more days during entry-level practice rotation or concentration rotation he or she will receive an incomplete for the rotation. The intern will be scheduled to make up the missed time. The maximum time frame for completing the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Dietetic Internship is 15 months (150% of the 10-month program). Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) SAP Standards Interns in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Dietetic Internship Program are evaluated on a numerical rating scale (based on 100 points) by the rotation site preceptor. The student is considered as maintaining satisfactory academic performance if he/she maintains a minimum average score of 70 in rotations, and 80 on assignments (as indicated below), to be evaluated at the end of each rotation. Rotations: Disease Management and Health Promotion >=70% Required for each rotation Four Core Competency Categories, Case Studies, Entry Level Practice Rotation, and Concentration Area Rotation >=80% Work assignments other than rotations Required Midyear Grade >=70% Overall grade required at Midyear for continuance in the program Total Overall Average >=80% Required at completion of Internship as overall composite percentage out of 100 points total An overall average score of 70 is required at mid-term for continuance in the program. Additionally, an intern may not continue in the program if an overall score of less than 70 is earned in three rotations. The mid-year and final internship scores will have a 5% deduction for each unexcused absence or excessive tardiness. Rotation scores will be reduced 5% for excessive tardiness to that rotation. Ex cessive tardiness is defined as two or more late arrivals to class, community event or rotation; three tardies results in acade mic probation and five tardies results in dismissal from the program.

Student Assessment Grading Policies Definitions: Course: Any portion of the program that includes instruction, has its own syllabus with grading criteria, and is identified as a discrete unit of instruction on the program calendar. Transcript grade: Several related courses may be combined for one transcript grade. Individual courses are co-requisites for the final transcript grade. When evaluating acceptable academic progress in the first semester, course grades are considered independe ntly of the final transcript grade. Practicum: Also called rotations. This portion of the program involves time spent in the patient care laboratory and typically takes place during the second semester. The grading scale is as follows: 90 - 100% = A 80 - 89% = B 75 -79% Below 75% = = C F Lecture/Student Laboratory (June - December): Students must attain a minimum final grade of 75% in each course. Courses that include both a lecture and student laboratory are typically weighted as follows: Lecture 70% / Laboratory 30%; Parasitology does not have a clinical practicum component so the student lab grade constitutes the transcript grade. Patient Laboratory / Clinical Practicum (January - June): The clinical practicum grade consists of three compone nts: o Technical/Performance o Theory o Behavioral Evaluation (minimum of 10% of total grade) A minimum grade of 75% is required for both the technical and theory portions of the practicum. A minimum grade of 75% is required for the behavioral evaluation. Exit Exam: Students must pass a final comprehensive exam at the end of the program year. Students have three attempts to pass the exam with a minimum passing score of at least 75%. Transcript Grades Upon co mpletion of the year of training, an official transcript is sent to the State of Tennessee Medical Labo ratory Board, the American So ciety of Clinical Pathology Board of Certification or other certification organization, and, for 3+1 students, the affiliated university or college granting the baccalaureate degree. The following breakdown groups the courses, but may be altered upon request by Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 93 of 137 the academic affiliate. Final transcript grades are calculated using the co-requisite course grades. The most common co-requisite course weighting is Student Lecture/Laboratory course grade (50%) and the Clinical Practicum course grade (50%). However, alternative co-requisite course weightings may occur and are given in related co urse syllabi. Grading Transcript grades include the final grade received during the lecture/student laboratory and the corresponding clinical practicum for the particular course. Generally, the lecture/student laboratory and clinical practicum share equal weight for the final transcript grade (i.e., each portion is weighted at 50% so the average of the two portions is the final transcript grade). Deviations from this general weighting occasionally occur if there is a large discrepancy in the length of time between the course lecture and practicum portions. Such a deviation will be noted in the course syllabus and is designed to evenly distribute the weight, based on the time commitment required of the student in each portion. Individual courses are co-requisites for the final transcript grade. When evaluating Satisfactory Academic Progress, course grades are considered independently of the final transcript grade. Satisfactory Academic Progress Students are required to maintain established program standards of competence and knowledge. An overall grade of 75% in each course, including the lecture/student laboratory and clinical practicum, is required for the successful completion of the course. Students who do not meet this requirement are removed from Satisfactory Acade mic Progress status and subject to a range of academic remedial actions, as outlined in this catalog under the policies of the VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health. Advanced p lacement credits are not allowed. The program and a ll related courses must be completed in their entirety for a transcript to be created and given. S tudents must successfully complete all componen ts of the program within the 13 months of the program and in the order presented. The Program Advisory Committee reserves the right to extend a student's training to make up for a deficit in a single course, but this remediation is not to extend training more than five (5) months from the end of the program year. Graduation Requirements Students must achieve an overall minimal grade of 75% in all courses. Students must achieve a minimum of 75% on all Behavioral Evaluations. Students must pass their final comprehensive exam at the end of the year with a 75% or higher. Students must pay tuition and fees in full. Upon s uccessful completion of the program, students are eligible to sit for exams to receive national certification. Upon receipt of national certification by a recognized na tional agency, students become eligible for licensure from the State of Tennessee as a Medical Laboratory Technologist. Successful completion of the Program is not contingent upon passing of any national certification exam.

In those programs, for any course that is repeated, a Repeat will be provided as the grade for the first attempt at the course. Any course with an \"R\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. However, cou rses will be considered hours / credit hours attempted for the purpose of determining maximum time frame. Please refer to each program's student handbook for information about whether students are allowed to repeat courses in any given Students who do not complete required work or hours in a course will be assigned a failing grade for the course. Clinical Rotation E valuations Students receive a clinical evaluation at the end of each week. The Clinical Coordinator will review these evaluations with each student. These evaluation conversations allow for frequent and co nstructive feedback to students on their professional development. These evaluations are counted toward the quarterly review of Satisfactory Academic Progress Satisfactory Academic Progress Each students' academic progress is evaluated quarterly. A student is considered to be maintaining satisfactory academic progress (SAP) if he/she maintains a 70 percent academic average in didactic coursework and a 75 percent academic average in clinical rotations. In add ition, students must have satisfactory attendance in order to maintain satisfactory academic progress. Prior to the quarterly determination of SAP status, the student, the Program Director and the Clinical Coordinator meet to discuss the student's progress. These meetings include discussion of grades in didactic courses, evaluations in clinical rotations, radiation exposure reports, absences, contact hours, etc. Students are given the opportunity to discuss any questions or concerns they may have related to their acade mic progress. Following this meeting the Program Director and the Clinical Coordinator make a determination of whether or not the student is maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress. Students receive a clinical evaluation at the end of each week. The technologists responsible for supervision of the students during the week review these evaluations with each student. These evaluation conversations allow for frequent and constructive feedback to students on their professional development. These evaluations are counted toward the quarterly review of Satisfactory Academic Progress.

The perfusionist prepares and operates the heart-lung machine and other sophisticated equipment as directed by healthcare physicians. The perfusionist measures various blood and other parameters to identify appropriate mechanical, pharmacological, and thermal manipulation to maintain tissue viability. To perform these tasks the perfusionist must have a thorough und erstanding of both the physiology and an atomy of respiratory and circulatory systems and be able to operate complex equipment. Additionally the perfusionist must be capable of handling stressful situations, pay great attention to detail, communicate effectively, and be willing to stay abreast of new de velopments in the profession. The Vanderbilt Perfusion Program was founded in 1979. The program is directed in collaboration with the Vanderbilt Heart and Vascular Institute. Certification/Credentialing Upon co mpletion of the program gradua tes receive an accredited Certificate in Cardiovascular Perfusion Technology that qualifies graduates to apply for and take the Perfusion Basic Sciences Examination and the Clinical Application in Perfusion Exam administered by the American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion (ABCP).

Offered in the Summer Semester Prerequisites: SIM 502, CR 501, RES 502, CVPT 502 Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 127 of 137 Grading and Assessment Didactic Evaluation System The grading scale for the VUMC Perfusion Program is as follows: Scale Grade Definition GPA 100-95% A Excellent 4.0 94-90% A- Excellent 3.7 89-87 % B+ Good 3.3 86-83% B Good 3.0 82-80% B- Good 2.7 79-77 % C+ Satisfactory 2.3 76-75% C Satisfactory 2.0 74-0% F Inadequate 0.0 P Pass -Any course with a \"P\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. F Any course with an \"F\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. However, the course must be repeated and pa ssed to graduate. I An Incomplete may be used at the discretion of the instructor in those cases in which the student is not able to complete work in the normal time. In those instances, the student and instructor develop a written plan for an extension to provide work by a specific date that falls within the period of time specified by the relevant program's requirements (but in no circumstances greater than one month). An \"I\" that is not replaced by a letter grade within the period of time specified by the relevant program's requirements, due to unsatisfactory completion of the student's plan, will be changed to an F after the period specified by the program (a period not to exceed one month). Any course with an \"I\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. Once a grade is assigned to the course (when conditions are met that allow for the removal of the \"I\" and assignment of a final grade), that grade will factor into the student's GPA. W A Withdrawal is provided when a student leaves the course due to an approved leave-of-absence or is withdrawn from the school prior to the scheduled completion of a course. Any course with a \"W\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. Succe ssful completion of a course requires a student to receive a 75% or greater for the final grade for the course. Scores are calculated according to the derivation chart in each syllabus. Students who do not complete required work or hours in a course will be assigned a failing grade for the course. Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 128 of 137 Final grades for each co urse are computed on the following bases: Students must attain a final grade of 75% in each course in order to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. Non-academic evaluations (beha vior and conduct evaluations) will be completed by instructors for academic advising and/or remediation purposes. While these evaluations are calculated into the grade, behavior/professionalism conce rns (e.g., missing of examinations or classes, tardiness, etc.) will have negative consequen ces for the student's ability to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress, putting the student at risk of SAP Warning, probation and/or dismissal from the program. Clinical Evaluation Student clinical competency is measured by means of a clinical evaluation form. The clinical evaluation form has been designed to address the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor learning domains of the program as well and the interpersonal domain. The form is reviewed by the student and the instructor immediately following each case. If the evaluation consistently shows lack of competency in a particular area of a student's performance, the student will receive increased instruction and practice. Extra simulation sessions facilitated and supervised by the Program Director may be required. In add ition the student will be evaluated on a mid-term evaluation and/or end of rotation evaluation by clinical instructors as outlined in the syllabus of each clinical course. The clinical evaluation scale is as following: 1. Dependent: > 90% of the time the student almost REQUIRES direction, guidance, monitoring, and support, while < 10% of the time the student EXHIBITS assertiveness, efficiency, focus, and eagerness to learn. 2. Novice: 75% of the time the student REQUIRES direction, guidance, monitoring, and support, while 25% of the time the student EXHIBITS ass ertiveness, efficiency, focus, and eagerness to learn. 3. Assisted: 50% of the time the student REQU IRES direction, guidance, monitoring, and support, while 50% of the times the student EXHIBITS assertiveness, efficiency, focus, and eagerness to learn. 4. Supervised: 25% of the time the student REQUIRES direction, guidance, monitoring, and suppo rt, while 75% of the times the student EXHIBITS assertiveness, efficiency, focus, and eagerness to learn. 5. Self-Directed: < 10% of the time the student REQUIRES direction, guidance, monitoring, and suppo rt, while >90% of the time the student EXHIBITS assertiveness, efficiency, focus, and eagerness to learn. Students are expected to make appropriate clinical progress over time, as outlined in each of the clinical courses' syllabus. Clinical Competence At the completion of the case requirements for each clinical level - or at any time by the request of the Program Director - the student's clinical performance is evaluated by the members of the Clinical Competency Committee. The student advances to the next clinical level by passing the preceding clinical course. Satisfactory Academic Progress In order to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress through the curriculum plan, the student must achieve a grade of \"75%\" or better at all times in each course including simulation, research lab courses and c linical rotations. It is recommended that each student monitor his/her own progress according to the course syllabus. Students who do n ot meet these requirements during the semester will be placed on an acade mic monitoring with a remedial action plan. Academic Year 2020 -2021 Catalog - Center for Programs in Allied Health Page 129 of 137 Progression in the Program The program and all related courses must be completed in their entirety for a transcript to be created and given. Advanced p lacement is not allowed. All grades of Incomplete must be replaced by a final grade before a transcript can be created. Students are required to complete all compone nts of the program within the 22 months of program matriculation, and in the sequen tial order as presented in this catalog. The Program Advisory Committee reserves the right to extend a student's training to make up for a deficit in a single course, but this remediation is not to extend training more than five (5) months from the end of the program year. Graduation Requirements Students in the VUMC Perfusion Program are required to do the following in order to graduate with a Certificate in Cardiovascular Perfusion Technology: 1.

Participate in exit interview with the Program Director. National Examination/State Licensure After successful completion of the course of study, graduates of the VUMC Perfusion Program are eligible to take the national certification examination administered by the American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion. The certification exam is a two exam process. The first exam is the Perfusion Basic Science Exam (PBSE) and requires the student to have gradua ted from an accredited perfusion program, completed 75 clinical cases, and be given clinical competency clearance by the program director. The second exam is the Clinical Application in Perfusion Exam (CAPE) in addition to the requirements for the PBSE the applicant must also have completed 40 independent clinical cases after gradua tion. It is entirely the students' responsibility to seek guidance from the American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion regarding the certification process, and it is likewise entirely the students' responsibility to seek guidance from any and a ll licensing bodies that may impact their practice, either as students prior to gradua tion, or as practicing perfusionists following graduation. Certification by the ABC P is a pre-requisite for licensure in all states that currently offer licensure to perfusion care providers. Students graduating from an ac credited program will be eligible for a provisional license in those states requiring a license. The permanent license will be granted upon satisfying the certification process.

VUMC reserves the right to obt ain, copy, and convey to outside persons any records or electronic transactions compl eted using VUMC information systems in the event it is required by law or institut ional policy to do so. VUMC may also in its reasonable discretion, when circumst ances require, obtain and review any records relevant to an internal investigation concerning compliance with VUMC rules or policies applicable to faculty, staff, or to all others granted use of VUMC's information technology resources. Users therefore should not expect that records created, stored or communi cated with VUMC information technology or in the conduct of VUMC's busin ess will n ecessarily be private. VUMC reserves its right to any work product generated in the conduct of its busin ess. G. Locally Specific Policies Individual units within VUMC may create additional policies for information resources under their control.

Only one Vanderbilt Card is issu ed to any authorized individu al. Temporary or dupli cate badges are not issu ed. 3. Each individu al is accountable for the security of the issued Vanderbilt Card, and the badge is not to be loaned, sh ared or given to anyone else to us e. 4. Each individu al issued a Vanderbilt Card creates a four-digit PIN to be used in conjun ction with the badge. Use of four identical or four consecutive digits (e.g., 1234 or 1111) as a PIN is not permitted. Do not use the last four digits of your social security numb er or your date of birth (e.g., 0410 for April 10th) as a PIN. 5. The user is expected to tap their Vanderbilt Card to the Card Reader as he or she leaves a device to ini tiate the Lockout. 6. A lost or stolen Vanderbilt Card is reported by the assigned user to the VUMC Help Desk as soon as the loss is dis covered. C. Security token (something the user has): 1.
