This balance column value is generated by adding or subtracting dr and cr column value. For more explanation, if dr is 0 then cr value will be subtracted from balance value and if cr is 0 then dr value will be added to balance value, and the balance column first value will come from particulars (=opening) column's dr or cr value then the calculation will start and running total of balance will be made. I have attempted some Crystal Report formulas to accomplish this but failed to get the required values. I have also attached snapshot of my attempted formulas. First page of report This image is the formula I used in this report for running total. But this approach is not calculating the correct sum and this formula is not working on next page of report as it starts from the beginning on next page If anyone knows any other useful and easy way to calculate running total which is suitable in my current situation then please guide me.
