Martin's seminal work on the very early embryo iden tified the emergence of two distinct cell lineages, one on the outside that is polarised and the other on the inside that is not. The outside cells will develop into the placenta and the inside cells will become the embryo proper1. This work sits at the fo undations of a field of reproduction and fertility that touches u s all. The programme, entitled Inside -\u00adOutside: Challenges and Prejudices recognises an exemplary career pursuing activities that link basic science and communication at all levels, with our r esponsibilities to society as a whole. Inside -\u00adOutside: Challenges and Prejudices therefore also describes the promises and prejudices that have been, and continue to be faced, when science meets a society that is not ready to accept or understand it. Marti n's tireless, creative, and usually successful, endeavours to forge new paths, facilitate understanding and build new bridges, have been the gifts of a visionary scholar, considerate teacher and very generous human being. In that spirit, we hope that today you will be educated, stimulated, challenged and have lots of fun. The Organising Committee would also like to thank Peter Braude, Fiona Duncan, Gina Glover, Rhiannon Williams, and all of the generous sponsors of the event, as well as the conference coordinators Nicola Harris and Jill Rogers.

Venue information 6 Session chaired by : Sarah Bray Professor of De velopmental Biology, University of Cambridge Sarah runs a research group at the University of Cambridge where she teach es medical students in the early stages of their training. Sarah is also co -\u00addirector of a Wel lcome Trust 4 year PhD programme that she h elped to set up in 2000. Sarah's research focuses on understanding fundamental genetic mechanisms that allow our bodies to form correctly. Sarah's passion for science started when she was an undergraduate given the opportunity to work with inspiring people , and this led her to continue with a PhD after her first degree (when she met Martin Johnson who was her PhD examiner!). This was followed by a post -\u00addoctoral stint at Harvard, which cemented Sarah's motivations and taught her many new things , setting the foundations for her subse quent work in Cambridge. Sarah joined the then Anatomy department in 1991 and had two fantastic mentors, Martin Johnso n and Rob White, who welcomed her into their domain and helped her get started on her independent career. Since t hen Sarah's research group has gone on to achieve international recognition and they continue to be excited about and fascinated by the mechanisms underlying cell -\u00adcell communication during development. INVERSNAID By Gerard Manley Hopkins This darksome burn , horseback brown, His rollr ock highroad roaring down, In coop and in comb the fleece of his foam Flutes and low to the lake falls home. A windpuff -\u00adbonnet of f\u00e1wn -\u00adfr\u00f3th Turns and twindles over the broth Of a pool so pitchblack, f\u00e9ll -\u00adfr\u00f3wning, It rounds and rounds Despair to drowning. Degged with dew, dappled with dew Are the groins of the braes that the brook treads through, Wiry heathpacks, flitches of fern, And the beadbonny ash that sits over the burn . What wo uld be world be, once bereft Of wet and of wildness? Let them be left, O let them be left, wildness and wet; Long live the weeds and the wilderness yet. Reproductive challenges Part 1 7 Nick Hopwood Reader in History of Science and Medicine, Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge 'Proof and publicity in claims to human in vitro fertilization' Nick runs the Wellcome Trust -\u00adfunded 'Generation to Reproduction' programme that is reassessing the histor y of reproduction over the very long term. Nick trained in developmental biology, he is the author of Embryos in Wax (Whipple Museum, 2002) and Haeckel's Embryos: Images, Evolution and Fraud (Chicago, 2015) , co-\u00adeditor of Models: The Third Dimension of Scie nce (2004) and co -\u00adcurator of the online exhibition Making Visible Embryos (www.hps.cam.ac.uk/visibleembryos). He is currently co -\u00adediting a book for CUP on Reproduction: Antiquity to the Present , writing a visual history of human embryos and working, with M artin Johnson and Sarah Franklin, on the history of IVF. Ashley Moffett Professor of Reproductive Immunology , Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge 'Border control: biological mechanisms that define the territorial boundary between the m other and her fetus' After medical training at University of Cambridge and Middlesex Hospital, Ashley trained as a histopathologist, eventually running the Pathology service for the Rosie Maternity Hospital, Cambridge. Since 1990, she has worked as an imm unologist in the Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge studying a unique population of immune cells present only in the uterine lining. Ashley's main interest is to understand how the mother's immune system in the uterus regulates placentation t o ensure that both the demands of baby and the future health of mother are met. This balance goes wrong in major disorders of pregnancy such as pre -\u00adeclampsia, still -\u00adbirth, recurrent miscarriage and poor fetal growth. Reproductive challenges Part 1 8 Session chaired by : Peter Braude Emeritus Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, King's College London At King's, Peter was Head of the Department of Women's Health and directed the Centre for Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis for the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. He has been involved in assisted reproduction and embryo research for nearly 40 years, first in Cambridge where he worked with Martin Johnson in the Anatomy Department and with whom he shared two MRC programme grants, and then in London where he became Head of Dep artment at Guy's and St Thomas Hospital. He was a member of the HFEA (1999 -2004), Chairman of the RCOG Scientific Advisory Committee (2004 -2007), and also chaired the expert advisory committee on multiple birth after IVF, which produced the report One Chil d at a Time . More recently he was a member of the HFEA core panel that reviewed the scientific methods to avoid mitochondrial disease, and the Nuffield Council on Bioethics panel that considered the ethics of these emerging technologies. He was awarded an OBE in the 2015 New Year's Honours for Services to Reproductive Medicine. PIANO By D.H. Lawrence Softly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me; Taking me back down the vista of years, till I see A child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings And pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings. In spite of my self, the insidious mastery of song Betrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong To the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside And hymns in the cosy parlour, the tinkling piano our guide. So now it is vain for the singer to burst in to clamour With the great black piano appassionato. The glamour Of childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast Down in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.

David -\u00adEmlyn Parfitt Research Scientist, Celmatix, New York 'Decoding human fertility: zeroing in on the genetic markers of reproductive failure and success' After recei ving his undergraduate degree in Veterinary Science from the University of Liverpool, Emlyn went on to do his PhD in Embryology at the University of Cambridge, in the laboratory of Magdalena Zernicka -\u00adGoetz. It was there that he met Martin Johnson, who beca me a close mentor. Martin encouraged him to explore the possibility of living further afield, and Emlyn went on to do his postdoctoral research at Columbia University in New York, where his research focused on defining the gene networks underlying embryoni c development and stem cell biology. For the past two years he has been applying similar principals to investigate the genetics of human fertility at a Celmatix, a personalized medicine company based in New York.

NAMING OF PARTS By Henry Reed To-\u00adday we have naming of parts. Yesterday, We had daily cleaning. And to -\u00admorrow morning, We shall have what to do after firing. But to -\u00adday, To-\u00adday we have naming of parts . Japonica Glistens like coral in all of the neighboring gardens, And to -\u00adday we have naming of parts. This is the lower sling swivel. And this Is the upper sling swivel, whose use you will see, When you are given your slings. And this is the piling swivel , Which in your case you have not got. The branches Hold in the gardens their silent, eloquent gestures, Which in our case we have not go t. This is the safety -\u00adcatch, which is always released With an easy flick of the thumb. And please do not let me See anyone using his finger. You can do it quite easy If you have any strength in your thumb. The blossoms Are fragile and motionless, never le tting anyone see Any of them using their finger. And this you can see is the bolt. The purpose of this Is to open the breech, as you see. We can slide it Rapidly backwards and forwards: we call this Easing the spring. And rapidly backwards and f orwards The early bees are assaulting and fumbling the flowers: They call it easing the Spring. They call it easing the Spring: it is perfectly easy If you have any strength in your thumb: like the bolt, And the breech, and the cocking -\u00adpiece, an d the point of balance, Which in our case we have not got; and the almond -\u00adblossom Silent in all of the gardens and the bees going backwards and forwards, For to -\u00adday we have naming of parts.

Her work ranges from playful explorations of the biomedi cal sciences, long term studies of way in which the landscape has been altered by human conflict, to social -\u00adpsychological explorations of the landscape. Gina's biomedical studies are exhibited in around 20 hospitals, clinics and private collections in Brit ain and worldwide, including the Gregor Mendel Institute, Austria. Her latest book, The Metabolic Landscape, Perception, Practice and the Energy Transition is published by Black Dog Publishing. Andrew Sharkey Director of Studies in Pre -\u00adclinical Medic ine and Associate Lecturer of Pathology, University of Cambridge 'No one is an island entire of itself....' Embryology and John Donne Andrew read Natural Sciences at Christ's College, where he was supervised by Martin Johnson, followed by a PhD at Edinburg h studying genetic variation in malaria. His interest in how genetic variation affects reproductive success began through work in Edinburgh in which he showed that many infertile men have microdeletions in the Y -\u00adchromosome. In 1998, Andrew established a research group based in Cambridge in the Department of Pathology to study mammalian implantation. Using transgenic mice, primate and human models, the group seeks to understand the molecular basis of endometrial receptivity and early implantation. A second major interest involves collaboration with Ashley Moffett, studying interactions between fetal trophoblast and maternal uterine NK cells during early pregnancy. The aim is to understand how the maternal immune system regulates placental development and how this is compromised in some pregnancies, leading to diseases such as pre -\u00adeclampsia.

WARNIN G TO CHLDREN By Robert Graves Children, if you dare to think Of the greatness, rareness, muchness Fewness of this precious only Endless world in which you say You live, you think of things like this: Blocks of slate enclosing dappled Red and green, enclos ing tawny Yellow nets, enclosing white And black acres of dominoes, Where a neat brown paper parcel Tempts you to untie the string. In the parcel a small island, On the island a large tree, On the tree a husky fruit. Strip the husk and pare the rind off: In the kernel you will see Blocks of slate enclosed by dappled Red and green, enclosed by tawny Yellow nets, enclosed by white And black acres of dominoes, Where the same brown paper parcel -\u00ad Children, leave the string alone! For who dares undo the par cel Finds himself at once inside it, On the island, in the fruit, Blocks of slate about his head, Finds himself enclosed by dappled Green and red, enclosed by yellow Tawny nets, enclosed by black And white acres of dominoes, With the same brown paper parce l Still untied upon his knee. And, if he then should dare to think Of the fewness, muchness, rareness, Greatness of this endless only Precious world in which he says he lives -\u00ad he then unties the string. Development conundra Part 2 13 Evelyn Houliston Director of Res earch, Villefran che sur Mer Marine Station 'Inside -\u00adout and upside -\u00addown: a jellyfish perspective on mammalian egg and embryo polarity' Following undergraduate training at the University of Sussex, Evelyn completed her PhD in Martin Johnson's group in Cambridge, working e xtensively with Bernard Maro on cytoskeletal organisation in preimplantation mouse embryos. As a post -\u00addoc she then spent three years with Rick Elinson in Toronto, dissecting microtubule based movements driving the amphibian egg cortical rotation, a classic developmental biology problem that she continued to address after moving on to France. Evelyn obtained a CNRS permanent re search post at the Villefranche sur M er Developmental Biology Laboratory (LBDV) in 1994. Initially within Christian Sardet's group , she showed by parallel studies in the ctenophore Beroe and in Xenopus that localised intracellular cell cycle activation can influence embryo organisation. Evelyn became a group leader in 1996, and has been preoccupied since 2004 with developing a new labor atory model, the small jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica , which has provided a fresh perspective on diverse biological questions in eggs, embryos and evolution. Since 2009 she has been Director of the Laboratoire de Biologie du D\u00e9veloppement de Villefranche sur Mer Marine Station, France . Nancy Papalopulu Professor of Developmental Neuroscience, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester 'Dynamics of gene expression lead to a new understanding of cell state transitions ' Nancy obtained her PhD at the National Institute for Medical Research, UK and was a post -\u00addoc at the Salk Institute for Biomedical Research, US. She was a Group Leader at the Gurdon Institute, Cambridge, from 1997 to 2006. In Manchester, she has served as Research Grouping Leader f or Developmental Biology (2007 -\u00ad2011) and Section Head for Tissue Systems (2011 -\u00ad2014). She is a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow, an elected member of EMBO and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences. Nancy is interested in understanding how cells make transitions between cell states such as differentiation, proliferation and quiescence. In neural progenitors single cell imaging with unstable reporters has revealed asynchronous pulsatile fluctuations in regulatory gene expression, which is masked b y static measurements of population averages. Nancy's group have discovered that a simple transcription factor/microRNA network (Hes1/miR -\u00ad9) controls this pulsatile expression, drives cell state transitions and provides a mechanism by which cells may time their 'exit' from the progenitor state. Mathematical modeling predicts some beneficial properties of stochasticity in this network. They use Xenopus tropicalis , zebrafish and mouse cultured cells as model systems. Development conundra Part 2 14 The Open Public L ecture will take place in the lecture theatre of the Anatomy Building on the University of Cambridge Downing Street site at 18.00 . Session chaired by : Anne Ferguson -\u00adSmith Professor of Genetics and Head of Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge Anne is Professor of Genetics and Head of the Department of Genetics at the University of Cambridge. She received her PhD from the Department of Biology at Yale University and subsequently spent five happy years as a postdoc with Azim Surani from 1989 -\u00ad1994 where she learnt the wonders of genomic imprinting. She joined the Department of Anatomy in 1994 and from the start benefitted from the generous support, wisdom an d mentorship of Martin Johnson. For the past two decades, her team has studied genomic imprinting in developme nt and disease and the epigenetic control of genome function in a wider context. Her current research focuses on three themes: stem cells and the epigenetic programme, functional genomics and epigenomics and development, environment and disease. She is a W ellcome Trust Senior Investigator, elected member of EMBO and a Fellow of the UK Academy of Medical Sciences. Open Public Lecture 15 Azim Surani PhD, CBE, FMedSCi, FRS Director of Germline and Research at the Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge Azim, born in Kenya received his PhD in 1975 at Cambridge University under Professor Sir Robert Edwards FRS (Nobel Laureate, 2010). He joined the Babraham Institute in 1979, and discovered 'Genomic Imprinting' in 1984, and subsequently, novel imprinted gene s and their functions, with contributions to the mechanisms through establishment and erasure of DNA methylation. In 1992, he joined the Wellcome Trust Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute when he was elected as the Marshall -\u00adWalton Professor in the Departme nt of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, and subsequently, Director of Germline and Epigenomics Research at Cambridge University. More recently he has worked on the genetic basis of germ cell specification in mouse and human, on the derivation of ge rm cells from stem cells in vitro, and on the mechanism of epigenetic programming in early germ cells. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1990, Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2001. He is a member of EMBO and a Fellow of the Third World Academy of Sciences. He has received several awards including Royal Society's Gabor Medal (2002), and a Royal Medal (2010). He was awarded a Nehru Fell owship by the Indian Government, and the International Society of Stem Cell Research's McEwen Awar d for Innovation in 2014. 'Germline: t he eternal link between all generations ' Germ cells are immortal as they alone can perpetuate the species. Sperm and eggs, the end products of germline generate a totipotent zygote. Primordial germ cells, the precurso rs of sperm and eggs, are established during early postimplantation development. Recent advances allow derivation of primordial germ cells (and potentially gametes) from pluripotent stem cells from embryos and skin cells in culture. These advances provide significant insights on the origin and the unique properties of mouse and human germline. Germline transmits genetic and epigenetic information in the form of reversible tags associated with the DNA (DNA methylation). An egg contains all essential inform ation for totipotency, and some organisms can develop to adulthood without any contribution from sperm; this however is not the case in mammals. Mammalian sperm and eggs are 'imprinted' with heritable memory tags (imprints) of their parental origin that pe rsist into adulthood and they regulate expression of some key genes. For this reason, parthenogenetic development in mammals is not possible. These tags are erased and reset appropriately in the germline for each generation; faulty imprinting results in hu man diseases. Environmental factors might also potentially induce epigenetic changes, which could be transmitted to subsequent generations. Whether environmental factors, including diet and stress has such an effect on the body and behaviour transgeneratio nally is under intense investigation. Recent advances in genome editing methods could also be used to advance our knowledge of early human development, and potentially for the eradication of heritable disease related genetic mutations. Parliament recently approved the use of manipulations of human eggs for the eradication of the devastating mitochondrial diseases from afflicted families.

Formal dinner 18 From: Catherine Twilley, Fellow, Developmental Director, Christ's Col lege Martin Johnson has been a member of Christ's College since 1963 when he came to the College as an undergraduate. He has had many roles, such as Tutor, Vice -\u00adMaster and President, and in each of them he has demonstrated his care and warmth for the Coll ege and its people. He has been a particular champion of staff and students at Christ's and is remembered with great affection by generations of students. He currently acts as President of the Christ's College Medical Alumni Association, through which he s eeks to bring together alumni in medical professions and students currently studying medicine. From: Susan Golombok, Centre for Family Research In March 2011, the Centre for Family Research hosted a reprise of the lecture that Martin delivered in honour of Bob Edwards' Nobel Prize in Stockholm in December 20 10, entitled 'Bob Edwards: The early years' . At the Centre, we study the children and families created as a result of IVF, so it was a particular honour for us to host this lecture. And what better pe rson could tell us the story of Bob's early years! The lecture provided an illuminating insight into Bob the scientist and Bob the man, and was much appreciated by all who were there including the Mayor of Cambridge, Bob and Martin's colleagues from Cambri dge and beyond, researchers and students. Martin has been connected with the Centre for Family Research for many years. Martin Richards and I hugely value his intellectual and social contributions to our seminars and workshops and consider him to be a high ly influential figure in our history. About Martin ... 19 From: Bill Harris, Head of Department, Professor of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience It is a pleasure and an honour to write about Martin's immense, indeed unique, contribution to the Department of Physiol ogy, D evelopment and Neuroscience. The long and fruitful association stretches back to 1964 when two of his first -\u00adyear undergraduate subjects were anatomy and physiol ogy. Along with Azim Surani, he was in the first cohort of Bob Edwards' graduate students, igniting an enduring interest in reproductive physiology. I am personally gr ateful to Martin for acting as h ead of the Department of Anatomy for the first year of my time in Cambridge which allowed me valuable time to e stablish my research programme. Characteristically, Martin brought great energy and vision to the role, radically restructuring the support services and introducin g major changes to teaching. He pulled off the difficult trick of effecting real change whilst taking people with him through th e clarity of his exposition and his understanding of their concerns. For several years after Mar tin had stepped down as acting head of department, I turned to him for his wise and generous counsel. Superb administrator as he was, Martin's passions were alw ays research and teaching. Martin's distinction as a researcher is well documented in this celebration of his scientific work, so I will focus here for a moment on his contribution to teaching. He was, and still is, a wonderfully lucid and intellectually engaging lecturer, supporting scientific rigour with clear, elegant expre ssion, and a sense of history. These qualities are very evident in Essential Reproduction , the deservedly popular textbook which he co -\u00adauthored with Barry Everitt and which has run t o seven editions. Martin was also the primary architect of the highly regarded Part II Anat omy B course, Disease, Society and Sexuality. The course was incredibly innovative and risqu\u00e9 for this University, perhaps too much so, although it may have been t he best course that many of our students ever had. We could no longer run this course in the new merged d epartment, certain aspects of it have had long -\u00adlasting positive reverberat ions through all our teaching. Although we no longer teach this course, those in the d epartment who taught the course, remember it with excitement and passion.
