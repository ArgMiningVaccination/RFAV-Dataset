In this extract alone, over 100 academic research articles, studies and trials are offered in support of the handful of anti-viral ingredients that are included here. 'AVD' is a three-stage project of which this publication documents the findings of Stage One in regards to what is known about the anti-viral dietary components up to now. The book as a whole contains the work of over 1000 scientists in support of an anti-viral diet and this corroborative research covers a period of more than 50 years. The majority of ingredients discussed in this diet have been evidenced to have significant effects against COVID-19, both in terms of their anti-virality or due to immunomodulatory qualities.

AVD: The Anti-Viral Diet (2nd Revised Edition) 2020 This extract from 'AVD' presents a five-page article by Edouard d'Araille about the curiously unscientific approach that has been adopted by many bodies towards the scientific evidence provided in support of anti-viral dietary ingredients. Taking as its starting-point an article by the Reuters News Agency published on 27th April 2020 (signed by 'Reuters Staff') and called 'False claim: 12 herbs and spices can prevent or treat different viruses', this five-page passage from 'AVD' examines for a moment the contradictory and confusing attitude of some national health bodies and the media in regards to the anti-viral nature of food and drink ingredients. A number of issues are raised which are at the heart of the overall argument of this monograph. Above all, the call is made to listen to the science and not ignore what does not fit a certain narrative. This extract is provided here courtesy of Living Time Books. Nutrients The use of dietary supplements (DSs) has been steadily increasing all over the world and additionally, the sales of DSs have dynamical increased in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in most of the countries. We investigated DSs phenomenon in 2020 through (1) exploration of Google searches worldwide and in Poland (with Google Trends (GT) tool), and (2) analyses of results of PLifeCOVID-19 Online Studies conducted during the first and second wave of the pandemic. The conducted GT analysis and cross-sectional studies revealed that during the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, the interest in immune-related compounds and foods like vitamins C and D, zinc, omega-3, garlic, ginger, or turmeric, as well as their consumption increased. Improving immunity was the main reason behind the supplementation and changes in consumption of pro-healthy foods. GT analysis has shown these interests were positively correlated with the interest in COVID-19, but adversely with cumulative cases ... Foods As media reports have noted, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated market mainstreaming of immune-boosting food bioactives, supplements, and nutraceuticals. However, most studies reporting on the potential of bioactives against COVID-19 transmission have been uploaded as preprints with little opportunity to revise content for benefit and impact. The current review discusses current best evidence and information underpinning the role of food ingredients and bioactive compounds in supporting immune functions in humans and animals, specifically in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease. Up to now, some evidence from randomized population and clinical trials has suggested that vitamin D levels may be linked to COVID-19 transmission and severity. Numerous theoretical studies have pointed to polyphenols and particularly flavonoids as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is also inconclusive evidence to support the future use of -glucan to address COVID-19 due in ...

Background and aims: Balanced nutrition which can help in maintaining immunity is essential for prevention and management of viral infections. While data regarding nutrition in coronavirus infection (COVID-19) are not available, in this review, we aimed to evaluate evidence from previous clinical trials that studied nutrition-based interventions for viral diseases (with special emphasis on respiratory infections), and summarise our observations. Methods: A systematic search strategy was employed using keywords to search the literature in 3 key medical databases: PubMed\u00ae, Web of Science\u00ae and SciVerse Scopus\u00ae. Studies were considered eligible if they were controlled trials in humans, measuring immunological parameters, on viral and respiratory infections. Clinical trials on vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals and probiotics were included. Results: A total of 640 records were identified initially and 22 studies were included from other sources. After excluding duplicates and articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 43 studies were obtained (vitamins: 13; minerals: 8; nutraceuticals: 18 and probiotics: 4). Among vitamins, A and D showed a potential benefit, especially in deficient populations. Among trace elements, selenium and zinc have also shown favourable immune-modulatory effects in viral respiratory infections. Several nutraceuticals and probiotics may also have some role in enhancing immune functions. Micronutrients may be beneficial in nutritionally depleted elderly population. Conclusions: We summaries possible benefits of some vitamins, trace elements, nutraceuticals and probiotics in viral infections. Nutrition principles based on these data could be useful in possible prevention and management of COVID-19 International Journal of Pathogen Research Aims: COVID-19 pandemic affects hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Since there is no effective treatment, the need of finding alternative methods, which can help to curb this pandemic is urgent. This study aims to collect the information on the virucidal and toxicity properties of the Allium species. This genus is known to be source of nutraceuticals and also used as food. In this context, species of this genus can be proposed as an alternative solution against COVID-19. Methodology: The literature review was conducted on Allium spp during searches on different databases such as PubMed, PubMed Central, Science Direct, Scielo, DOAJ, Science alert and Google scholar. The scientific names of Allium species, antiviral compounds, antiviral activity and toxicology of the plants of interest were used as keywords. Mendeley was used to make bibliographic references and the chemical structures of the natural compounds from Allium genus were drawn using ChemBioDraw Ultra 12.0 software.... Universal Journal of Pharmaceutical Research 2020 Coronavirus pneumonia disease (COVID-19) is a newly identified coronavirus strain that causes symptoms ranging from cold-like signs to deaths that reached millions around the world. Until this time, there is no approved vaccine has been invented for clinical use, therefore, developing an effective program for therapy is of high priority to save the lives of patients and protect others from being infected. Nature resembles a huge reservoir of anti-infectious compounds, from which innovative ideas, therapies, and products can be deduced. Chinese herbal medicine had succeeded in the treatment of other coronavirus pneumonia such as SARS, MERS and, H7N9 avian influenza which gives us hope to find the targeted remedy in the traditionally used natural herbs consumed by natives from different regions. This work aims to highlight the use of natural traditional remedies to treat viral pneumonia. This systematic review will include studies of the effects of traditional herbal medicine and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Although promising results were obtained in many cases, but, only a few studies reported the fractional characterization of bioactive principles and/or mechanisms of action. It is requested that pharmaceutical industries, government agencies, and the scientific community will have a gaze at some of these plants for future research and, to find a potential drug candidates for the development of anti-SARSCoV-2 therapeutics in the near future. Frontires in Medicine 2020 COVID-19, a disease induced by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2), has been the cause of a worldwide pandemic. Though extensive research works have been reported in recent days on the development of effective therapeutics against this global health crisis, there is still no approved therapy against SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, plant-synthesized secondary metabolites (PSMs) have been prioritized to make a review focusing on the efficacy of plant-originated therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19. Plant metabolites are a source of countless medicinal compounds, while the diversity of multidimensional chemical structures has made them superior to treat serious diseases. Some have already been reported as promising alternative medicines and lead compounds for drug repurposing and discovery. The versatility of secondary metabolites may provide novel antibiotics to tackle MDR (Multi-Drug Resistant) microbes too. This review attempted to find out plant metabolites that have the therapeutic potential to treat a wide range of viral pathogens. The study includes the search of remedies belonging to plant families, susceptible viral candidates, antiviral assays, and the mode of therapeutic action; this attempt resulted in the collection of an enormous number of natural therapeutics that might be suggested for the treatment of COVID-19. About 219 plants from 83 families were found to have antiviral activity. Among them, 149 plants from 71 families were screened for the identification of the major plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) that might be effective for this pandemic. Our investigation revealed that the proposed plant metabolites can serve as potential anti- SARS-CoV-2 lead molecules for further optimization and drug development processes to combat COVID-19 and future pandemics caused by viruses. This review will stimulate further analysis by the scientific community and boost antiviral plant-based research followed by novel drug designing. BALAI BESAR 2020 The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic disease due to its rapid spreading worldwide, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that has brought about many fatalities. Until now, no effective treatment in the form of anti-virus medication or vaccine has been available for the disease. Therefore, this review aimed to identify some important medicinal plants with herbal formulae and guidelines which are used to treat viral diseases especially pandemic COVID-19 disease. Based on this argument, an online search was performed, which assisted to identify a group of plant species harboring antiviral properties. In the recent past, some natural herbal compounds prepared from existing medicinal plants available surrounding us have demonstrated encouraging antiviral properties. This review can be used as guidance of traditional medicine for the alternative treatment of COVID-19 disease with the utilization of medicinal plants.
