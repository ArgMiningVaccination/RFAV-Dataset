What happens during your acupuncture session? Stimulating specific points in the body by using needles to penetrate the skin is not only a very effective way to relieve pain - it is also relatively pain free. Many patients don't feel any discomfort at all. While the special acupuncture needles do their work, our acupuncturist will also perform a variety of techniques such as acupressure (a traditional form of Chinese pressure point massage), cupping, moxa and herbal medicine. Managing your body's energy for 100s of years Acupuncture was developed hundreds of years ago in China and the benefits were soon to be recognized by medical practitioners in Europe and the United States. It regulates the flow of energy in the body, which, if blocked, can cause health problems. Acupuncture helps open up these pathways and thus results in significant pain relief.
