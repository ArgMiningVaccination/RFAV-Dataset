We are excited that you are a student in our college, and I want to provide you some information that I hope will be of assistance to you during your academic journey. A very important person during your time with us is your advisor. This individual is available to assist you in planning your program of studies and answer questions about future career options. I urge you to meet regularly with your advisor especially if you have any questions, concerns , or need help with any academic, College, or campus issues. Faculty and staff are prepared to work with you on an individual basis and help guide you through your journey with us. Additional career information can also be found in our Administrative Offices in Fargo - Sudro 123 and by attending our Annual Career Fair in September. Our programs are designed to challenge you and to teach you to become an independent learner and work in collaborative teams. Therefore, students are expected to take a very active role in their education and assume responsibility for their own learning. You will be asked to apply your knowledge, dig for the answers to questions, communicate both verbally and in writing, critically think and problem -solve through case discussions, practice team -based care with students from other disciplines, and participate in numerous experiential activities. I encourage you to ask questions in class and to learn by understanding and applying the material presented rather than by simply memorizing factual information. The goal of our curriculum is for you to achieve the necessary life -long learning skills which will become important to you in your future career as a professional to be able to \"keep up\" with the plethora of new information. Your ultimate success will be determined by the amount of effort you are willing to put into your academic stud ies. So, work hard and give your best effort in all that you do. If you give us your best, you will receive the best in your educational experience with us. It will also be important that you learn more than just the technical skills of practicing in you r discipline but that you also learn what it means to become a professional and practice professionalism in all situations. You will need to learn how to practice ethically and responsibly, with honesty, integrity, and good moral character and treat others (especially those you serve ) with compassion, caring, understanding, and respect. These will be the keys to your future success. We desire to provide a positive learning environment for all of our students , and we strive to continually improve our program s. Students are a very important part of this process and we actively solicit your input and active participation through various formats. Students are elected from each class to serve on the Dean's Student Liaison Committee. This committee meets with the Dean throughout the year to bring student concerns to the attention of the administration. In addition, the College periodically holds a Deans' Open Forum to allow students an opportunity to interact directl y with the Dean (and his administrative leadership team) on matters of interest and concern to students. I also want you to know that my door is always open to you, so please don't hesitate to stop by my office if you need my assistance for anything. We encourage you to use these resources as well as visits with faculty, or any of the members of the staff in our Administrative Offices whenever you have issues that need to be brought to our attention. In addition, I encourage you to become actively involve d with your profession by joining one of our student professional organizations. This is a great way to learn about what's going on within your profession and begin contributing to the advancement of your future professional career and practice. This \"Hand book\" is devoted to academic information to help enhance student success within our program s. We hope you find it helpful. I wish you much success in your educational pursuits with us and in your later professional practice. Best wishes to you for a successful year!

NDSU (and the College of Health Professions ) reserve the right to refuse admission or re -enrollment or to place conditions on admission or re -enrollment of applicants and former students, or in certain instances, suspend or terminate the enrollment of stu dents, who NDSU and/or the College of Health Professions determine represent a safety risk to NDSU or the College students, employees, property, or affiliated teaching sites and their employees and patients. The North Dakota University System (NDUS) Polic y 511 requires criminal background checks and FBI checks for students in certain majors (see also NDSU Policy 607). The College of Health Professions at NDSU utilizes criminal background checks as well as FBI checks on students enrolled in our majors to h elp the College identify individuals who may be a risk to our people, property, and programs. Students who do not comply with the background checks, release of information, and the required deadlines for procuring background checks will be prevented from r egistering for and/or attending classes. HEALTH INSURANCE - College of Health Professions Policy 3.07 Students in the College of Health Professions are required to have adequate health insur ance coverage, in case they require health care or hospitalizati on while they are enrolled. The College does not provide health insurance for students, at any time while enrolled. Students are not covered by worker's compensa tion through NDSU or clinical agencies. We hope you find the following link helpful in procuring health insurance: https://ndus.edu/student -services -overview/health -insurance/ The i nsurance company and policy number will be provided by the student to the assistant in the department in which the student is enrolled before any experi ence in the clinical areas. Insurance may be obtained through the University or a company selecte d by the applicant. HEALTH VACCINES/EXPOSURE TO BIOHAZARD During portions of t he training program for PharmD students, the clinical experience of the Baccalaureate Nursing program, and Allied Sciences' internships, a student may be exposed to blood and body fluids of patients. Along with this exposure is the risk of Hepatitis B infection. Documentation of the co mpleted Hepatitis B vaccination series or a signed waiver is required prior to participation in experiential education. The full vaccination against Hepatitis B requires a six - month series of three shots. You can obtain the Hepatitis B vaccine from your h ealthcare provider, or from the NDSU Student Wellness Center. If you choose to get your immunizations at the Student Wellness Center, appointments are required. 6 SCHOOL OF NURSING INFORMATION North Dakota State University offers program s leading to th e Bachelor of Science Degree in Nursing (BSN). The curriculum of the nursing program is designed to develop knowledge and skills necessary for professional nursing practice. The nursing major is delivered over the course of two years enabling the student to build upon a foundation of liberal arts and natural sciences. The program curriculum prepares professional nurses who will anticipate and respond to changes affecting the health needs of individuals, groups, and communities. The nursing major is comm unity focused and addresses the nursing needs of individuals, families and groups throughout the life span. The curriculum emphasizes the assessment and promotion of health, and the treatment of health problems in a variety of settings. Students have clin ical experience in community and institutional settings. Some courses focus on the individual as a client with specific health needs in a family system, whereas other courses view the community as client. To enter the nursing program the student must qualify for and obtain admission to the University. Applications to NDSU may be obtained from the University Admissions Office or on -line at www.ndsu.edu/admission . When applying to the University , all students must apply as pre -nursing majors. Student are then moved into the correct sub-plan once accepted into the professional program. In order to apply to the LPN -BSN program, students must first be successful on the validation exams. The applic ation is then sent to students via e -mail. RN -BSN applicants can find the qualifications for application on the RN-BSN website: https://www.ndsu.edu/nursing/degrees/rn_to_bsn_track/ Tuition, fees, other expenses are explained on the NDSU website at https://www.ndsu.edu/onestop/accounts/tuition/ Essential Qualifications of Candidates for Undergraduate Admission and Progression Nursing education entails an assimilation of knowledge, clinical skill, and critical thinking relying on acquired judgment. These abilities are developed through the variety of didactic and practice opportunities throughout the nursing curricu lum. During their course of study, students interact closely with peers, clients, families, community agency personnel, faculty, and other health professionals. They engage in a variety of activities which involve a unique combination of cognitive, psycho motor, cultural, technical, and social abilities. In order to complete this rigorous course of study and to practice effectively as a nurse, one must demonstrate competence in many areas. Therefore, certain essential abilities are necessary for admission to the nursing program. A candidate must be able to perform all essential functions of the student nurse either with or without accommodation. The faculty reserves the right to change rules and regulations including those relating to admission, instruction and graduation. Such changes may apply to prospective students, as well as students already enrolled. Changes will be shared with students in a timely manner. However, it is the responsibility of the student to periodically contact their advisor, the program's website, or the School of Nursing Office to obtain current policies. 7 Nursing Program History The history of nursing education in Fargo dates back to the early 20th century when St. John's Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital each established a diploma school of nursing. The School of Nursing at St. John's closed a nd North Dakota State University (NDSU ) began an as sociate d egree nursing pr ogram in 196 9. In 198 6, NDS U and Concordia College (CC) began a co llaborative bacca laureate nursing program. St. Luke's Hospital School of Nursing and the ass ociate degree program at NDS U were discontinued. The co llaborative program was the Tri- College University Nursing Consortium (TCU). Students took nursing courses on the CC camp us and on the NDS U campus. In 1994 nursing faculty who had been employed by TCU became emp loyees of either CC or NDS U but continued to teach on either or both campuses irrespective of faculty appointment. In 2001 Minnesota State University Moorhead (MSUM), which opera ted a baccalaureate program for registered nurses, joined the nursing co nsortium and a collaborative master's degree pr ogram in nursing was initiated. In 2005, the three und ergradu ate programs disassociated from the co nsortium and became independent of one another. The LPN -BSN Program began in 2003 in collaboration with Sanford (Meritcare). The first class was all Sanford employees. NDS U initiated a doctor of nursing prac tice program in 200 5. In 2007 graduate programs at the three institutions became independent of one another. Nursing programs in the area cooperate with one anoth er in utilization of clinical sites, in addressing regional needs, and through the sharing of teaching/learning r esources. In June, 2014, NDSU acquired the Sanford College of Nursing (SCON) located in Bismarck, ND. SCON has been a well -respected, successful, free standing nursing program affiliated with the Bismarck hospital for over 100 years. The Bismarck program became kn own as NDSU Nursing at Sanford Health . In the Fall semester of 2014 , the pre -licensure BSN program on the Fargo campus expande d from admitting students each F all semester to admitting students each semester. The RN -BSN program began fall 2017. The second -degree/accelerated program began fall 2023.

Differential Tuition Students enrol led in the professional nursing program in the college are assessed a differential tuition fee . Funds from this fee provide financial resources to sustain the quality of the programs provided to students. 12 SCHOOL OF NURSING POLICIES SCHOOL OF NURSING UNDERGRADUATE GRADING SYSTEM POLICY 3.43 To prepare (LPN -RN) students for success in the nursing course and NCLEX and to be consistent in grading for all professional nursing courses, a standardized grading scale is used in the School of Nursing. The following grading scale is used for theory and clinical componen ts in the undergraduate nursing curriculum: A = 92 - 100% B = 84 - 91% C = 75 - 83% D = 67 - 74% F = 66% or less In all courses, a student is required to achieve an average of 75% or higher on course exams and quizzes. Courses may be exempt from this standard if exams/quiz points are less than or equal to 25% of the total course points. In all courses, students are required to achieve a cumulative course score of 75% or higher to pass the course. In the event that a student does not achieve an average of 75% or higher on course exams and quizzes, the average score on exams and quizzes will determine the grade assigned in the course. SCHOOL OF NURSING COURSE GRADE REQUIREMENTS: UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM POLICY 3.44 In order to prepare students for succes s in the professional nursing program and (to prepare LPN -BSN students for ) the NCLEX examination, a minimum grade is required in all nursing courses. The policy includes: 1. A required nursing course must receive a grade and not be on a pass/fail basis. 2. Undergraduate students must achieve a minimum grade of C in each of the nursing courses required in the major. 3. A grade of D or less is unacceptable, and the course must be repeated. The course may be repeated only once if the student wishes to progress in the program. For approval to repeat the course, refer to the Readmission to Progression in the Undergraduate Program - Policy 3.46. 4. A student who withdraws (W) from a nursing course must reapply for readmission (refer to Readmission to Progression in the U ndergraduate Program - Policy 3.46). The procedure for enforcing the minimum nursing course grade is: 1. Course coordinators/instructors will notify the Chair(s) of the Nursing Admission and Progression Committee and the Director(s) of the student's grade of D or less prior to or at the time the grades are due. 2. The Director(s) will notify the student of Policy 3.46, Readmission to Progression in the Undergraduate Program and direct the student to the Admissions & Academic Progression Readmission Request form . SCHOOL OF NURSING DISMISSAL FROM THE NURSING PROGRAM POLICIY 3.50 A student may be dismissed from the nursing program for failure to meet academic requirements (see Policy 3.44) or for egregious behavior incongruent with behavior expected of a professional nurse. The egregious behavior may be a significant incident or a series of incidents which constitute a pattern of behavior indicative of noncompliance with norms of professional nursing. Examples of egregious behavior include, but are not limited to: all forms of academic cheating, alcohol and other drug abuse, and violation of the Code of Ethics for Professional Nurses. Following a recommendation by faculty for dismissal of a student, the Associate Dean or Bismarck site Program Director wil l notify the student and the College of Health Professions' Admissions and Progression Committee of the dismissal from the nursing program. The College of Health Professions Academic Performance and Progression Committee will act regarding the student's st atus in the College. The student has the right to utilize the University's process to appeal decisions regarding dismissal. 13 SCHOOL OF NURSING GRADE APPEAL IN THE NURSING PROGRAMS POLICY 3.45 The undergraduate or graduate nursing student who wishes to appeal a grade must follow the University Grade Appeals policy (section 337). SCHOOL OF NURSING PROFESSIONAL APPEARANCE POLICY 3.48 Professional appearance instills confidence in others, sends a clear message that the nursing profession is credible and reflects self -confidence and good health. The following are minimal expectations for professional appearance for a School of Nursing (SON) student: The Agency's guidelines will be followed. Stud ents are required to follow facilities' policies regarding appearance and dress . The course instructor is responsible for sharing the appearance and dress expectations with clinical instructors and student during clinical orientation. The overall appearanc e will convey an image of professionalism. The NDSU pre -licensure student nurse uniform consists of: o A green uniform top with NDSU Nursing embroidery and green uniform pants. Uniforms must be purchased from White Banner (Fargo) and Uniform Center (Bismarck ). The student may wear a white long- or short -sleeved top under the scrub top. No visible writing is allowed on undershirt. (RN to BSN students will comply with the dress code of the individual agency involved in the clinical experience. o Shoes must be cl ean, closed -toed, closed -back, and supportive. Neutral color with white soles. o The approved personal identification name badge. o Laboratory coat. (LPN & RN to BSN students may not need a lab coat, dependent on agency guidelines) o Pant length should be \u00be to 1 inch from the floor to avoid hem dragging on the floor . Socks or stockings should not be visible. Fingernails will be unaugmented (i.e., no acrylic or gel nails), short, and without enamel. Jewelry will be minimal such as watch, wedding ring, engagement ring, no dangling jewelry . Strong odors including, but not limited to, perfumes, colognes, aftershaves, or cigarette smoke are not permitted (this includes strongly scented lotions). Tattoos may need to be covered per facility policy. Gum chewing is not ap propriate in the clinical site, the classroom, or other places in which one is in a nursing role. See additional guidelines in Policy 3.48 SCHOOL OF NURSING BASIC CARDIO -PULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR) POLICY 3.40 Nursing students must maintain certificati on for basic cardio -pulmonary resuscitation from the time clinical experiences begin in the pre -licensure BSN program and from the time of admission to the LPN -BSN and RN -BSN Program through graduation. CPR Certification must include: Adult - 2 person , child, and infant for the Health Care provider. Basic Life Support (BLS) for Healthcare Providers from the American Red Cross or the American Heart Association meet this requirement. Each student is responsible for securing certification and for submit ting verification of certification to the program. SCHOOL OF NURSING LPN -BSN & RN TO BSN STUDENT PORTFOLIO POLICY 3.54 The Nursing Student Achievement Portfolio is a collection of student work demonstrating academic and professional development. The port folio is a tool for documenting continuous progress toward program outcomes. The portfolio is used for both enhancement of student learning and demonstration of the Nursing program effectiveness. 14 Students are required to maintain their portfolios with evid ence of academic, nursing practice, volunteer, and community experiences. The collected work creates an evidential history of the student's learning progress and development as a professional. This is a requirement for progression. SCHOOL OF NURSING STUD ENT COMPLAINT PROCEDURES POLICY 3.53 The NDSU SON takes student complaints very seriously. Our goal is to ensure that students have access to transparent, due process in a manner that leads to an appropriate resolution of the complaint. While such proced ures do not always produce an outcome that meets the student's preferences, they do ensure that students have access to an equitable and efficient means to remediate their complaints. To that end, the Student Complaint Procedures policy is available in th e Student Handbook and College Policy Manual. Each student complaint will be appropriately documented and investigated. A chronological record of each complaint, including the nature of the complaint, written records of the complaint procedure and the final outcomes of the resolution process shall be maintained in the Office of the SON Associate Dean. Student complaints generally fall within two major categories: complaints about unfair grading and all other, non -grade - related complaints. Student com plaints about grades are generally handled at the level of the University, since grades are usually administered through the NDSU Office of Registration and Records. Other student complaints remain under the purview of the individual colleges within NDSU. Student Complaints Regarding Grades University Grade Appeal Policy NDSU has an established policy regarding complaints about grading, otherwise known as \"grade appeals\". The full grade appeal policy (section 337), which includes hearing procedures, is available at www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/policy/337.pdf. Non-Grade Stude nt Complaints Pre-professional and professional nursing students who have a non -grade -related complaint can seek resolution of that complaint through the following procedures. It is important to note that these procedures represent the sole avenue for student complaints regarding non -grade -related issues. The non -grade complaints are handled through the Office of the Associate Dean or Office of the Director at the Bismarck site. Records of non -grade complaints are also housed in the Office of the Associa te Dean or Office of the Director at the Bismarck site. 1. The student will file a formal written complaint (delivered through the postal service or NDSU email) to the Associate Dean's Office on the Fargo site or the Office of the Program Director at the B ismarck site. 2. The written complaint must include a description of the issue, policy, or procedure in question. It must also summarize the complainant's argument (including the grounds for the appeal or complaint) and provide a reasonable amount of eviden ce supporting the claim. 3. Within two business days of receipt of the complaint, the Associate Dean or Bismarck site Program Director will set up a meeting with the complainant and develop a timeline for investigation and response to the complaint. 4. Once th e investigation and decision has been made, the Associate Dean or Bismarck site Program Director shall prepare and submit a formal, written reply to the student. The reply will be sent through official NDSU delivery methods (i.e., the postal service, campu s mail and/or the NDSU email system). 5. Decisions that demonstrate arbitrary and capricious treatment, or that are fundamentally inappropriate in the eyes of the complainant may be appealed to the Dean of NDSU College of Health Professions . In such cases, the student(s) file an appeal using steps one through three outlined above, except the written complain would be addressed directly to the Dean. The written complaint would also identify and provide evidence indicating that the Associate Dean acted in an arbitrary, capricious or otherwise inappropriate manner. 6. If unsatisfactory resolution occurs after the appeal to the Dean, a final appeal may be made to the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs. Once again, the student(s) must file an appeal us ing steps one through three outlined above, except the written complaint would be addressed directly to the Provost, rather than the Dean, and would provide evidence substantiating the claim of unfair treatment at prior procedural levels. 15 ADDITIONAL SCHOOL OF NURSING INFORMATION SCHOOL OF NURSING GENERAL CLINICAL /LAB INFORMATION Students will likely be exposed to latex during their time in the NDSU nursing program. The SON tries to limit latex exposure including providing latex -free gloves; however, a latex -free environment is not guaranteed in the simulation lab, skills lab, or clinical sites. If a student currently has a latex allergy/sensitivity or develops one during their time in the program, please notify the course and/or clinical instructor. Students must also notify NDSU Disability Services who will work with the student and course instructor to determine reasonable accommodations. Students should notify lab and simulation coordinators prior to those experiences to ensure that the accommodations determined by Disability Services are available for the experience. Studen t contact with clients in the health care setting is accompanied by risk of exposure to communicable disease as well as responsibility to avoid spreading communicable disease. Documenting immunization and disease status is the responsibility of the student . Electronic copies of these records will be maintained by the School of Nursing Office. Students must submit evidence of having a health examination by orientation. If an injury is sustained during clinical experience, the student will Notify nursing clinical faculty immediately . Follow agency policy to avoid unnecessary costs. Complete an incident report (available from the clinical agency); submit one copy to the agency supervisor and one to the nursing clinical faculty. Seek medical advice from an appropriate health care provider. (While some agencies provide W orkforce Safety Insurance (workers' compensation) coverage for students, most do not. Assume that costs of care are the responsibility of the student and verify with the clinical instructor). Students have professional liability insurance through a group policy provided by the university. Students are covered by this insurance when they are enrolled at NDSU. (Coverage does not extend to activities outside the scope of the student role, e.g., doing a procedure not approved by the instructor, providing care as an employee of an institution or individual, internships that are not co -op or independent study experiences, completing clinical requirements of a course after the end of the course.) . 16 Immunization Documentation Required for NDSU School of Nursing Programs The purpose for requiring evidence of health status and current immunization is to provide a safe environment and protect fel low students, faculty, health care agencies, and patients from communicable diseases. Proof of health status and immunization is a lso required by health care agencies accepting students for clinical experiences. When health requirements of a clinical agency exceed NDSU SON requirements, the student will be advised of additional information or immunization requirements prior to the s tart of clinical experience in that agency. The student will be responsible for providing the required additional information to the Academic Assistant prior to starting clinical experience at that agency. Any student not meeting health status reporting requirements will not be permitted to attend clinical, and/or continue in the program until proof of health care status is received. The student is also responsible to inform the Program Director of any changes in health status while they are a student at NDSU. Immunization Requirements Renewal TB Must have one of the following upon entrance into the program: 1. Two Step TB Skin Test : The first test is given and then read within 72 hours. The second test is given no earlier than one week after the first test was administered and no later than three weeks after the first test was administered. The results turned in need to show date each test was administered, the da te each test was read; and the result. 2. Blood Tests . Student may have a blood test done, either the QuantiFERON or the T -Spot. Results should show the date the test was administered and the result. Annually. Before one year has passed from the date the TB test was administered, the Student needs to have a one -step skin TB test done. In the event you are even one day late, you would have to repeat the two -step skin test or blood test. Hepatitis B A titer showing immunity is acceptable. Most students had the Hepatitis B series as a child. Evidence of the three Hepatitis B shots is required unless a titer showing immunity is presented. If the student has not completed the Hepatitis B series, they will need to start the series in order to be compliant. The student will then need to complete the series on the regularly recommended immunization guides. No renewal needed. MMR A titer showing immunity is acceptable. Measles, Mumps, Rubella - again this is a series that was usually completed as a child. N eed to show proof of the two MMR shots If student has not had the series, must complete the series as are regularly done. No renewal needed. Tdap Student must show proof of having had a Tdap immunization within the past ten years Must be renewed every ten years. Flu Shot Must have a flu shot by no later than October 31 of each year. Student must provide proof every year. Yearly. Varicella A titer showing immunity to the varicella (chicken pox) virus is preferred. Student may also show proof of the series of varicella shots. No renewal needed as long as there is proof of immunity. COVID While the COVID vaccination is no longer a requirem ent of most clinical facilities/agencies, the SON may be required to provide documentation if a student is vaccinated or not. Therefore , students must provide documentation of vaccination status to the SON. 17 SCHOOL OF NURSING STUDENT AND ALUMNI RECORDS The student transcript which lists credits and grades for all courses taken is the permanent record of each student's progression. This record is confidential and is not released except at the request o f the student. Transcripts are maintained by the Office of Registration and Records.

The College has established professionalism and ethics as two of i ts core values. Pharmacists, nurses, allied health care professionals, public health professionals, and pharmaceutical scientists must live u p to the high ideals of their profession. Their lives must be guided by the principles of honesty and integrity, i n order to ensure that the public can regard their words and actions as unquestionably trustworthy. To develop an understanding of and respect for these principles of honesty and integrity as applied to the academic work of p harmacy, nursing, allied science, and public health students, the College of Health Professions has developed this student conduct policy. This policy is applicable to anyone enrolled as a student in the College, including those in the pre - professional, professional, and graduate programs. This policy also applies to any student taking a course for credit in the College. Acceptance of this policy is required as a condition of admission to the College. Academic Standards The academic standards of the College of Health Professions differ from those of the University. Any student who fails to meet or exceed the University standards may be placed on University probation or suspension (see the current NDSU Catalog for university information on academic deficiencies). Semester Grade Point Average (All Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all undergraduate and professional students shall maintain a semester grade point average of 2.00 or above for each semester enrolled in the College of Health Professions . All graduate students are expected to maintain a 3.0 grade point average as well as any other academic policies outlined by the graduate school. Any student who fails to attain a semester GPA of 2.0 or above may be placed on College probation. Students who have been placed on academic probation for two (2) consecutive or three ( 3) non -consecutive semesters shall be suspended from enrollment in the College. After two suspensions, students will be terminated from the College. (Termination from the College does not prohibit the student from registering elsewhere in the University pr ovided the academic standards of the alternate college of registration have been met or exceeded.) A student who is suspended and desires readmission into the College must file a request for re -admittance with the Dean at least 60 days prior to the beginn ing of the semester in which readmission is sought. In addition, professional students must seek readmission to the professional programs in Pharmacy, Nursing, Allied Sciences, and Public Health through the Admissions Committee of their respective program. Minimum Grade Requirement (Professional Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all students enrolled in the professional programs of the College must complete all required courses within the College with a grade of \"C \" or above. S tudents are encouraged to refer to program -specific policies related to minimum grade requirements which can be found here. https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/healthprofessions/documents/College_of_Health_Professions_Policy_Manual_4.19.pdf Graduate students are expected to uphold policies and procedures consistent with the graduate school and to maintain a 3.0 grade point average. Students Enrolled in College Affiliated Educational Training Programs (Professional Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all students enrolled in College affiliated internships, clinical, or experiential training programs are also required to uphold the academic standards of that affiliate and will be subject to the terms of probation, suspension, and termination of the affiliated program. Students failing to meet affiliated program academic standards may also lead to termin ation from the College. Conduct Standards High standards of professional conduct are expected from all students, both to facilitate the learning of all students and to promote professional values. Individuals are expected to represent the College, professional p rogram, or profession in a positive, professional manner. Students conducting clinical experiences, rotations, and/or internships must also uphold the specific policies of the ir clinical site. 20 All students are held responsible for exhibiting the following professional attributes: honesty, integrity, accountability, confidentiality, and professional demeanor.

The scholarship ceremony honor s students receiving scholarships and donors who award scholarships. All students are welcome to attend and scholarship recipients are required to attend. Pinning Near graduation, senior classes have a pinning ceremony, which is an event centered on each student receiving his/her nursing pin. The NDSU Nursing pin is presented to each graduate of the program by the School of Nursing. A brief explanation of the history of pinning is given in the followin g paragraphs. The pinning ceremony, which is a separate celebration from receiving a diploma, is a time-honored nursing school tradition rich with symbolism. The pinning ceremony symbolizes the achievement of completing the educational requirements and mar ks the graduate's transition into the profession . This ceremony signifies initiation into the brotherhood and sisterhood of nurses. The history of this rite of passage can be traced back to the Crusades of the 12th century. During this time, the Knights of St. John, the Order of the Hospitaller, tended to injured Crusaders. When new monks were initiated into the order, they vowed to serve these sick soldiers in a ceremony where each monk was given a Maltese cross, the first badges given to those who served as nurses. In the 1860's, when Florence Nightingale was awarded the Red Cross of St. George in recognition for her service to the injured during the Crimean War, she shared this honor, by in turn presenting a medal of excellence to her brightest graduates. By 1916, the practice of pinning new graduates was standard throughout the U.S. Nursing Pins are a proud symbol and tradition shared by nurses across the country. These pins are one of the most visible signs of educational achievement in the nursing pro fession. The pin serves as a notice to the public that graduates are well educated and fully capable of accepting the responsibilities, privileges, and rights that come with the nursing profession. Regardless of where their new careers in nursing take the graduates, their pin will represent where they earned their professional education. The current NDSU nursing pin design is based on the NDSU seal and is in the NDSU school colors of green and gold. The pin bears the name of the university. Stylized she aves of wheat border the pin and are reminiscent of the university's land grant tradition. The lamp, symbol of nursing, is in the center of the pin with the flame representing knowledge. Above the lamp are the initials of the degree received, BSN. The pin was designed by the Nursing Student Council of 2005 -2006 with input from the nursing student body. The class of 2006 was the first class to wear the NDSU BSN pin. 33 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES Academic Advisors Students in the LPN to BSN and RN to BSN nursing program a re assigned a faculty advisor. It is strongly recommended that students meet with their advisor in person or via phone or Zoom on a regular basis to receive updated curricular information. Advisors help students learn how to complete the registration procedures and to assist students to remain on track to meet goals and to graduate in a timely manner . Students are responsible for the course and program selections which they make . However, an advisor is a valuable source for acquiring info rmation about the advisability of students ' choices. Orientation North Dakota State University (NDSU) provides orientation for all new undergraduate students, both entering freshmen and transfer students taking on -campus courses. Individuals entering NDSU for the first time as full -time students are expected to participate. The purpose of orientation is to familiarize new students with the philosophy, programs, and student services at NDSU. The orientation program is designed to introduce new studen ts to campus life through involvement with upper class student leaders for first -hand information. At the conclusion of the orientation program, students receive comprehensive registration assistance. Registration Prior to the start of classes each semes ter, students must register for courses according to the instructions published on the Office of Registration & Records' web page ( www.ndsu.edu/registrar ). New students have two opportunities for registration prior to fall semester. The first opportunity is in conjunction with the summer orientation program. The second opportunity is during the fall orientation, which is scheduled just prior to the beginning of classes in August. In either case the proc edure is similar. The methods of registration are published each semester on the Office of Registration & Records' web page ( www.ndsu.edu/registrar ) via the campus connection link. Registration for students cur rently enrolled at NDSU Students who are currently enrolled are encouraged to register early for their next semester. Early registration for the nex t semester is usually scheduled at the midpoint of the current semester. Students are informed of the date s for advising week and expected to make an appointment with their advisor. Students are encouraged to consult and become acquainted with their advisor and professors as well as Associate Dean and Directors in their major area. 34 GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS These requirements apply to all students who enter NDSU in pursuit of a baccalaureate/professional degree. Refer to www.ndsu.edu/registrar for a current and complete listing of General Education course offerings, policies and transfer procedures. Only courses approved by the General Education Committee and University Senate may fulfill category requirements. A student who has completed an associate of arts or an associate of science degree general education program in the United States or Canada at a regionally accredited institution and who transfers to NDSU or who pursues a second baccalaureate degree at NDSU is considered to have completed his or her lower -division general education requirements at NDSU.

CREDITS How many credits will I lose when I transfer to NDSU from another school? Ordinarily you shouldn't lose any. However, a \"D\" grade in any course may not transfer to the College of Health & Human Sciences . Some technical courses may not fit your degree program and in this case some extra work may be required. For evaluation of transfer credit see current NDSU Catalog . How many credits can I transfer from a junior or community college? All college -level credits from regionally accredited institutions transfer; however, not all may apply to the particular degree program you have selected. To obtain a baccalaureate degree you must complete at least 60 semester credits at a four -year college or university. At least the last 37 of these credits must be at the junior or senior level. (See current Catalog .) What are Common Course Numbers? Institutions i n the North Dakota University System have established common course numbers (CCN) for many courses to facilitate transfer of courses within the System. Under the CCN agreement, transfer students who have successfully completed CCN courses will not be requ ired to retake them. Course requirements will have been fulfilled; however, CCN courses will not fulfill residence requirements nor will 100 and 200 level courses fulfill upper -division requirements for graduation. How do I challenge a course? A student who is currently registered may seek credit by challenging a course. A course challenge usually consists of a special comprehensive examination; however, additional types of performance may be required for some courses. A course challenge is only permitt ed for courses in which the student has not received transfer credit or has no previous academic record. Prior registrations are allowable if course was dropped prior to the Record Drop deadline in a given term. Student must be registered at NDSU during th e semester in which you wish to challenge a course. Further, credits earned by course challenge will not satisfy requirements toward a graduate degree. Procedures for pursuing a course challenge include the following: 1. Obtain a Petition for Course Challenge form available online at https://www.ndsu.edu/onestop/student -forms 41 2. Obtain approval from the academic advisor, the instructor of the course, and the chair of the department offering the course. Clarify expectations of the challenge, e.g., examination only or examination plus other performance. Based on the nature of the course and content area, some courses may not be approved for challenge by the department. 3. Pay the course challenge fe e at Customer Account Services, Ceres Hall 302, after receiving approval for the challenge. (The fee is 50% of the regular credit tuition charge, not subject to tuition cap.) Student must present proof of payment, along with course challenge form, to the O ffice of Registration & Records or Bison Connection. 4. Arrange a mutually convenient date and time for the challenge with the instructor or department . 5. Upon receipt of the signed Petition for Course Challenge form and a grade change form from the department, courses and credits successfully challenged are listed on the student's academic transcript with a passing grade. Unsuccessful challenges are not recorded. What does advanced placement mean? Students from high schools that participate in the Advanced Pl acement Program may earn credit through examinations provided by the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB). The examinations are administered at the conclusion of a college -level course taught in participating high schools. The scores are forwarded, upon student request, to the college of choice. In accordance with North Dakota University System policy, a minimum score of three is required to receive credit for the examinations. A complete and current listing of AP examinations and their NDSU equi valent courses is available at www.ndsu.edu/registrar/placement. Is it possible to obtain college credits by taking examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board (CLEP and AP)? Yes. Students may demonstrate evidence of college -level achievement through the use of nationally standardized tests. Competency to write these examinations may have been gained through intensive preparation in high school, extensive reading in a partic ular field, or other types of formal or informal preparation. A student may not repeat by proficiency testing a course that has been previously taken or failed at NDSU or another accredited institution. Score reports must be sent directly to NDSU from th e awarding agency/board. School reports and student -issued grade reports are not considered official for purposes of awarding credit by examination. CLEP Examinations are computerized and administered as needed. To register for a CLEP Examination, contact the Counseling Center, Ceres 212, 231 -7671. DEGREES How do I petition for a waiver or substitution of a curriculum requirement? To petition, you must obtain a \"Request to Waive or Substitute Courses\" form under the link, \"Substitute/Waive a Course\" a t www.ndsu.edu/, you state exactly why you think you should have a waiver. The Committee will review your petition and you will be notified of their decision. (Petitions should be submitted only when special circumstances make it virtually impossible for you to meet the regular degree requirements.) Only departmental and college requirements may be waived. University requirements may not be waived. GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS Who must complete the General Education Requirements? The General Educati on Requirements apply to all students. A student who has completed an associate of arts or an associate of science degree general education program in the United States or Canada at a regionally accredited institution and who transfers to NDSU or who pursu es a second baccalaureate degree at NDSU is considered to have completed his or her lower -division general education requirements at NDSU. What are the General Education Requirements? The General Education Require ments are listed in the current NDSU Catalog. A list of the courses approved for the different categories is provided under General Education Requirements in this handbook and also under Campus Connection -Registration Information - www.ndsu.edu/bisonconnection/connect. General Education transfe r with the ND University System. Students who plan to transfer from one institution to another in the ND University System should check with Office of Registration & Records in Ceres 110 or One Stop in the Memorial Union. GRADES AND ACADEMIC STATUS What is the G.P.A.? Grade Point Average. For each credit of \"A\" you receive four (4) honor points; three (3) for each credit of \"B\"; two (2) for each credit of \"C\"; one (1) for each credit of \"D\"; and zero (0) for each credit taken in which a grade of \"F\" is received. The GPA is computed by dividing the total number of honor points earned at NDSU by the total number of credit hours in which honor points were recorded. For example, a person with a G.P.A. of 3.00 has a grade average 42 of \"B.\" The minimum GPA of 2.00 is required for graduation. Developmental courses do not count toward graduation requirements. What does a grade of Incomplete (I) mean? For specific information, refer to current NDSU Catalog . The College of Health Professions may have specific requirements for an Incomplete. See Administrative Office of the College, Sudro 123. What is meant by taking a course on Pass/Fail? Eligible students may elect to take a course for the grade of \"Pass\" instead of A, B, C, or D. If the course is not pass ed, a grade of F is recorded. The grade of \"Pass\" is not computed in the GPA; however, an F is reflected in it. Pass/Fail allows students to broaden their education by electing a course in which they fe el they have limited aptitude or ability without run ning the risk of lowering their GPA. Check specific requirements regarding which courses may be taken pass/fail with your advisor. Pass/fail option may not be used for courses taken to meet general education requirements. If I do not do well in a course , may I take it over again? Yes. The second grade, whether higher or lower , will replace the first grade in computing the GPA. Both grades are listed on your Permanent Record. To replace a grade for a course taken at NDSU, that course MUST be repeated at NDSU. The one exception is that NDSU students may register for a Tri-College course to repeat a course previously taken at NDSU. Will I receive mid -term grades? Mid-semester grades of a D or F are posted in Campus Connection so advisors can discus s student's success during advising week. What is a deficient student in the College of Health & Human Sciences ? Any student who, in any semester, fails to attain a grade point average of 2.00 is considered deficient. All students in the College of Health & Human Sciences must maintain a 2.00 each term to remain in good standing in the College. Our standards are higher than the University requirement. What happens if I'm classified as a deficient student by the University? The University may issue e ither an academic warning or an academic probation sanction. See the NDSU Catalog for details ( https://catalog.ndsu.edu/ ). MINORS How many credits are required for a Minor? The number of credits required for a m inor varies by departments. The minimum number of credits for a minor is 1 8. To determine the exact number of credits that you will need for a minor, check with your advisor , the department website or One Sto p. REGISTRATION Students will use the \"Campus Connection Student Portal\" via the NDSU Home Page in which to register for classes. Students will also use this portal for the following: account information, class list for the semester, course catalog of cla sses, drop/adds, financial aid informa tion, holds, schedule of classes for the semester, unofficial transcripts, and much more. Th e web address for this site is https://www.ndsu.edu/onestop/connect/ Do I need to see my advisor about my semester schedule? Yes, make an appointment with your advisor during advising week to plan your schedule of classes. Dates for advising and registration are published in the annual \"NDSU Academic Dates & Deadlines\" pocket calendar, the Office of Registra tion & Records web site (www.ndsu.edu/registrar) and \"The Spectrum,\" published twice per week when full semester classes are in session. WITHDRAWING TO ZERO CREDITS How do I withdraw to zero credits? If you find it necessary to withdraw to zero credits during any semester in which you are enrolled, you must file a completed \" Withdrawing to Zero Credits\" form, www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms . Process your withdrawal at Bison Connection in the Memorial Un ion, during regular business hours, Monday through Friday.

Withdrawals after this date are not processed without evidence of compell ing circumstances beyond the student's control. If you do not want to attend the next semester but are finishing the semester you are presently enrolled in, simply do not register for the next semester. OTHER QUESTIONS What if I think a course is of poor quality or an instructor is unfair? Talk with the instructor first. If the situation is not resolved, notify the department chair or the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs & Assessment.
