Illness and death. Civil unrest. Economic troubles. These are a few of the top anxieties [Statista](https://www.statista.com/chart/11551/americans-top-fears-of-2017/) reported that Americans commonly fear. They might have considered adding dental procedures to the list in general and root canals in particular. If you plug the words \"root canal horror story\" into your search engine of choice, you'll get plenty of results from people ready to share their most terrible experiences. It's no wonder that potential dental patients remain perpetually on the lookout for root canal alternatives. While root canals aren't always awful (which we'll discuss a little more in the following section), we will talk in this article about how to avoid a root canal naturally and through more traditional means. Alternatives to root canal treatment Any time that a hole or crack appears in the enamel of your tooth, it's a boon for bacteria but a bad thing for the soon-to-be dental patient. Why? It allows the bacteria to reach the tooth's soft, pulpy interior and begin to multiply. An infection soon follows, and once it has begun, there's no way for the body to remove it on its own. Unchecked, infected dental pulp can lead to: - Pain - Swelling - Abscess - Tooth loss - Joint issues - Cardiovascular issues (e.g., heart attack, stroke) - Sepsis - Death The standard treatment for dealing with such infections is a root canal, which is also known as an endodontic treatment. Designed to protect the tooth itself, a root canal involves cleaning out the interior area of the tooth, sterilizing it, and filling it with a cement-like material. Because dental-pulp infections often involve a lot of pain and some of that discomfort used to get magnified during treatment, people have come to fear root canals. Advances in techniques and anesthetics have made most root canals almost completely painless, but it's understandable why people would look for an easier or cheaper alternative to root canals. Following you'll find several root canal alternatives or complimentary treatments. Direct Pulp Capping Like most alternatives mentioned in this article, direct pulp capping requires specific conditions and scenarios in order to prove successful. Sometimes, enamel may wear away or a tooth may become damaged, which exposes the dental pulp beneath. However, infection doesn't always progress deeper into the tooth, and in these instances, dentists may recommend placing a cap of calcium hydroxide or MTA (mineral trioxide aggregate) over the opening to avoid having to perform a root canal. Indirect Pulp Capping Indirect pulp capping is functionally identical to direct pulp capping, the only difference being the condition of the tooth itself. In cases where indirect pulp capping is appropriate, the enamel exhibits a smaller amount of decay or damage, and the pulp hasn't yet been exposed. This procedure prevents further damage. Pulpotomy At first blush, a pulpotomy sounds a lot like a classical root canal. It involves the removal of inflamed tooth pulp. But unlike a root canal, a pulpotomy preserves the tooth's nerves, and the material placed within the tooth aids in healing rather than just the elimination of [infection](https://www.westenddental.com/blog/using-antibiotics-to-treat-tooth-infection/). Apicoectomy An apicoectomy is generally only necessary after a root canal has been performed, making it a complementary treatment rather than a proper replacement. The only procedure for which it's a true replacement is the extraction of the tooth. An apicoectomy involves exposing the very end of the affected tooth's root, all the way down to the bone, and filling it. It's generally considered more invasive than a root canal. Natural Remedies Natural remedies can greatly benefit dental patients, particularly when it comes to prevention. Brushing and flossing are both natural, and religiously practicing these disciplines can keep you from ever experiencing a root-canal infection. If the pulp in your tooth is already infected, though, the application of salt water, tea tree oil, or garlic may help. However, because the consequences of a tooth infection can become so severe, seek more conventional treatments if your condition worsens while using natural treatments. Ozone Gas High-speed drills aren't the only tools that reach into the innermost recesses of a tooth. Ozone can also permeate into those hidden crevasses. One benefit to ozone is that it will effectively kill bacteria. One downside is that it does nothing to prevent further infections because it can't seal up any decay or damage. At best, it delays the need for additional treatment. Calcium Hydroxide Similarly, a calcium-hydroxide solution can halt bacteria growth much like ozone. It also will dissolve any dead tissue, making its removal less uncomfortable. Unfortunately, calcium hydroxide is extremely toxic and requires extra care when applying. Endodontic Retreatment An endodontic retreatment is a fancy term for a simple concept. Essentially, it means that root canals don't always successfully remove all the infected material and dental surgeons must sometimes perform the treatment again. This should be considered an alternative to tooth extraction. Tooth Extraction Although many patients don't want to undergo it, tooth extraction often makes more sense than attempting to save the tooth. Perhaps it's too damaged or the decay has advanced beyond the point of no return. Either way, pulling a tooth doesn't mean that you'll have to live with a gap-toothed smile as evidenced by our next two options. A Bridge Denture If you remove your tooth rather than undergoing a root canal, you'll want something to cover up the unsightly gap that remains. A [dental bridge](https://www.westenddental.com/dental-restoration/dental-bridges/) is one relatively simple cosmetic option. [Crowns](https://www.westenddental.com/dental-restoration/dental-crowns/) designed to fit on neighboring teeth anchor a false tooth that fits neatly into the space where the old tooth once was. A Dental Implant [Dental implants](https://www.westenddental.com/dental-restoration/dental-implants/) go one step further than bridges. Instead of suspending a false tooth between two crowns, the surgeon sinks a metal post into the jaw itself. Afterward, a cosmetic tooth will be attached to it. Dental implants are permanent solutions to missing teeth. Why Should You Consider a Root Canal? Most of the alternatives to root canals listed above are simply cases where an alternate or complimentary treatment will work well for a specific diagnosis. Sometimes, though, you really just need a root canal or a tooth extraction. Perhaps there's extensive damage to the tooth's enamel or you just have a terrible infection. Attempting other kinds of treatment could lead to other health issues, and you don't want those. A sobering article entitled [\"Toothaches and Death\"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10686905/) that was published in Journal of the History of Dentistry recounts how mouth pain led to numerous deaths in history. It stated, \"Deaths from dental [abscesses](https://www.westenddental.com/blog/what-to-do-if-a-dental-abscess-bursts/) today are so rare, that it is difficult to fathom that only 200 years ago, this was a leading cause of death. When the London (England) Bills of Mortality began listing the causes of death in the early 1600's, 'teeth' were continually listed as the fifth or sixth leading cause of death.\" In short, oral infections are no joke, and you should deal with them promptly, even if they require a root canal.
