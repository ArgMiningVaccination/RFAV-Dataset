Introduction Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a group of exceptional native health and medical structures, prod-ucts, and practices that fall outside scienti c medicine andwere developed by humans over many decades. 1,2CAM is a context that goes beyond the health eld to reach broader levels of religion, society, and culture.3The United States National Institute of Health (NIH) classi es CAM into ve categories: natural products, ancient medical systems,Keywords complementary and alternative medicine students pharmacy medicine knowledge attitude use LibyaAbstract Introduction Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a growing branch of medicine that can improve the quality of life of many people. This study aimed to assess comparatively the knowledge, attitude, and use of CAM among graduation year pharmacy and medicine students at the University of Benghazi, Libya.Method A cross-sectional survey was conducted among graduation year pharmacy and medicine students at the University of Benghazi for 4 months. The study tool was aself-administered online questionnaire and consisted of four main sections: demo-graphic data, use, knowledge, and attitude toward CAM.Results Most of the study respondents were females, and most were from Benghazi city. CAM use among pharmacy students was signi cantly higher ( p-value\u00bc0.001), with ruguia being used modality (52.5%), followed by cupping-Al hijama and herbal medicine. Minor ailments and acute illnesses were the main medical conditions treated with CAM, and the unnecessary physician intervention was the topreason for practicing CAM among students. CAM knowledge and attitude weresigni cantly higher among pharmacy students ( p-value\u00bc0.000 and 0.001, respectively).Conclusion CAM was commonly practiced among the study participants. Their overall knowledge of CAM was limited, whereas their attitude toward it was positive, with pharmacy students having a better degree of both. article published online July 19, 2022DOI https://doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0042-1750084.

As CAM became an inevitable practice, evaluating its use, knowledge, and perception among people, especially health- care professionals, is paramount. For instance, herb -drug interactions could have serious clinical consequences; hence, healthcare professionals should be equipped with the proper CAM knowledge. This should help avoid the possibility of anyherb -drug interactions and advise their patients in the future. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies on CAM practice among students in Libya. Therefore, this study comparatively assesses the knowledge, attitude, and use of CAM among graduation year pharmacy and medicine students at the University of Benghazi, Libya. Methodology Design and Participants This is a comparative cross-sectional study conducted amonggraduation year pharmacy and medicine students at the University of Benghazi, Libya, one of the leading universitiesin the country. It was done using an online self-administered questionnaire constructed using Google docs forms. The link was shared in students 'Google classrooms for 4 months (Oct 2020 \u2014Jan 2021). Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria All senior students, either in pharmacy or medicine faculties, at the University of Benghazi, irrespective of sex, age, or area of residency, were included in this study. Students from otherdepartments or universities and those not willing to partici- pate were excluded from the study. Study Questionnaire The questionnaire was constructed by reviewing similar studies done previously in different countries.7,9,12To avoidany bias that could result from misunderstanding the ques- tions, the questionnaire was rst designed in English and then made available for participants in Arabic. The goal of the study, as well as the related topic terms, was introduced at the beginning of the questionnaire to ensure enoughunderstanding. The questionnaire consisted of four main sections. The rst part covered the demographic data, including age, gender, faculty, and area of residency. The second section was concerned with CAM practice and enquired about the u s eo fC A Mb yr e s p o n d e n t sa n dt h e i rf a m i l i e s ,t h et y p eo fCAM modality used, the medical conditions, and reasons for use. Only the commonly used CAM practices in Libya were mentioned, including ruguia, massage, nutritionalsupplements, cauterization, honey (homeopathy), cup- ping-Al hijama, aromatherapy-essential oil therapy, and herbal medicine. The third section assessed the CAMknowledge of respondents related to use and included ten questions scored as one point for each correct answer and zero point for each incorrect, and I do not knowanswers. The sources of CAM information on which stu- dents relied were also assessed in this section. The last part evaluated the attitude of respondents toward CAMthrough 10 statements and was scored using a 5-point Likert scale. A score of three, less than three, and more than three were considered neu tral, negative, and positive respectively. Statistical Analysis The collected data was entered, coded, treated, and analyzed using Microsoft Excel (version 13) and Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Statistic for Windows, Version 20. IBMCorporation, Armox, New York). The data were tested for normality using the Shapiro -Wilk test that proved the non- normal distribution of data. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages were done using Microsoft Excel, whereas other tests were done using SPSS. The associ-ation between independent variables, including the study major, with demographic data and CAM practice, was tested using Pearson 's chi-squared test. Additionally, the Mann - Whitney U-test was used for nonparametric data to compare the difference of the continuous variables, including knowl- edge and attitude. In contrast, the reliability of the question-naire was tested using Cronbach 'stest. Results Respondents 'Demographics The demographic data of respondents are presented in Table 1 . Of the 120 participants, 62 were pharmacy stu- dents, whereas 58 were medical students. The response rates were 41.3% and 40% for pharmacy and medicine students,respectively, while the reliability coef cient was 0.77. The majority of respondents were females (99, 82.5%) in total and nearly equally distributed in each respondent group repre-senting 50 (50.5%) and 49 (49.5%) for pharmacy and medi- cine students, respectively. Respondents were mainly from Benghazi City (108, 90%), and pharmacy students were Ibnosina Journal of Medicine and Biomedical Sc iences Vol. 15 No. 1/2023 \u00a9 2022.

T h eP r a c t i c eo ft h eR e s p o n d e n t s CAM Use Thendings of CAM use among respondents are illustrated in Table 1 . Overall, three-quarters of respondents (91, 75.8%) stated that their family had previously used CAM. In contrast, more than half of them (68, 56.7%) had personally used CAM therapies with a statistically signi cant difference ( p-value\u00bc 0.000) between those students who had used CAM and having a CAM user among family. Moreover, family use of CAM was higher among pharmacy students (51, 82.3%) as comparedwith medical students (40, 69%), but this difference was statistically insigni cant ( p-value\u00bc0.089). Furthermore, phar- macy students (44, 69%) practiced CAM more frequently thanmedicine students (24, 41.4%), with a statistically signi cant difference ( p-value\u00bc0.001) between the two groups. Generally, ruguia was the most commonly used modality among participants (63, 52.5%), followed by cupping-Al hijama and herbal medicine in equal percentages (59, 49.2%) each. On the other hand, the least used modalitywas cauterization (8, 6.7%). Medical Conditions and Reasons for Using CAM The respondents practiced CAM mainly for the management of minor ailments (47, 51.6%) and acute illnesses (46, 50.5%), and the least used it for chronic diseases (22, 24.2%). Thenonseriousness of the medical condition was found to be the primary reason for students to use CAM, whereas only (11, 9.3%) of respondents justi ed their use due to the high cost of evidence-based treatments ( Table 1 ). Knowledge Related to CAM Use and Sources of Information Knowledge of Respondents The median knowledge scores of pharmacy and medicine students were ve and three out of ten, respectively. It was evident that pharmacy students had a better level of CAM knowledge with a statistically signi cant difference ( p-val- ue\u00bc0.00) ( Fig. 1 ). Table 2 shows the results of CAM knowledge related to using among respondents. Almost three-quarters of pharmacy (46, 74.2%) and medicine students (43, 74.1%) were aware ofherbal medicine 's possible unsafety and side effects. For the rest of the questions, pharmacy students had better knowl- edge, especially regarding the following information; bloodlipid-lowering effect of garlic ( p-value\u00bc0.001), use of Alzheimer effect of medical students had a signi cantly better knowledge regarding the safety of ginseng in hypertensive patients ( p-value\u00bc0.001). Sources of CAM Information Generally, the Internet was the most common source of information (66, 55.9%) for all participants of this study,followed by other medical practitioners (64, 54.2%). Other sources of information were nearly equally used by both groups, except for the friends/colleagues source, which wasused by more than half of pharmacy students (32, 51.6%) but used only by 5 (8.9%) of medical students. Percentages for the use of each source are represented in Table 2 . T h eA t t i t u d eo fR e s p o n d e n t st o w a r dC A M Considering 50 as the total score, the median score of pharmacy students 'attitude toward CAM (42) was higher than that of medical students (39), and this difference was statically signi cant ( p-value \u00bc0.001) ( Fig. 2 ). Several questions assessing the respondents 'attitude toward CAM are represented in Table 3 . Pharmacy respon- dents generally had a more positive attitude toward most ofthe surveyed statements; medical students showed a non- signicant higher positivity toward the following two state- ments; the possible risks of CAM to the public ( p-value \u00bc 0.279) and disapproval CAM therapies ( p-value \u00bc0.820). Discussion Recently, the use of CAM to promote health and treat ill- nesses has gained increased global popularity.11Due to the insufcient data about this subject in Libya, the main objec- tive of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and use of CAM among senior year students of two faculties in one of the leading universities in the country. In thissurvey, more than half of the students reported using some CAM therapies previously, consistent with the ndings of similar studies conducted in Kuwait and Ghana. 13,14Howev- er, our nding was higher than that found among medical students in the United States (13%)15and pharmacy students in the United Kingdom (31.5%)10but lower than that ob- served among pharmacy students in Sierra Leone (72.7%)11 and university students of various disciplines in Australia(81.1%) 16 Green eld et al17suggested that students practice CAM more if another family member had already used it, which is consistent with the ndings of this study.

CAM has beenused in various diseases such as rheumatology problems, gastroenterological diseases, attention and hyperactivity problems, rhinosinusitis, psychiatric and neurological prob-lems, asthma, and gynecology problems. 18In this study, students mostly used CAM to treat minor ailments (e.g., skin problems) and acute illnesses (e.g., the common cold), which concurs with previous groups 'ndings.2,10 A systematic review of the potential factors in fluencing the usage of CAM worldwide revealed that the top three reasons were an expectation of CAM bene ts, dissatisfactionwith standard medicine, and the perceived CAM safety.19The study respondents gave various reasons to practice CAM; ofthose, the simplicity of their medical condition came rst, followed by their belief in the safety of CAM therapies and the ineffectiveness of standard therapy, consecutively. Ruguia spiritual healing headed the list of the most commonly used CAM modalities in this study, agreeing with previous studies conducted in Oman and Saudi Arabia. 20,21In contrast, an Australian study revealed that spiritual healing such as prayers and meditation were not as common as other practices such as relaxation techniques, massage therapy, and herbal medicine.16Additionally, aromatherapy and ho- meopathy were the most commonly used therapies in astudy conducted in the United Kingdom, 17whereas herbal medicine, which came second in this study, was the most prevalent in other studies.10,11 The signi cantly better degree of CAM knowledge shown by pharmacy students in this study compared with medical students is consistent with a similar study done amongKuwaiti students. 13This foreseen difference might be be- cause the faculty of medicine 's curriculum is focused on signicantly proven medicine only. On the contrary, in the pharmacy faculty, the department of pharmacognosy curric- ulum introduces modules covering a few aspects of CAM during which students are frequently introduced to medici-nal plants and their uses throughout the rst 3 years of study. This might be worthy of recommending introducing CAM to medical students and integrating them with modern medi-cine. CAM products are frequently handled, and this might represent a potential risk if not having the adequate amount of knowledge regarding the subject. Another reason whymedical students showed less knowledge might be that even though both groups of respondents depended on the Inter- net, a less credible source of information, medical studentsTable 2 (Continued ) I.

An almost equal and considerable percentage (74.2%) of respondents from both groups were aware of the possible occurrence of side effects by CAM products and therefore canbe considered more knowledgeable than other students in comparable studies. 7,22This somehow complies with the second most common reason for using CAM mentioned by 39% of respondents who stated that they use CAM products because they are natural and safe. On the other hand, this ismore consistent with the positive attitude that the respon- dents expressed toward the danger of CAM toward patients. Students showed the best knowledge regarding the effect ofcinnamon on blood sugar and cholesterol (70.8%), which is not a surprising response as cinnamon is a ubiquitous and frequently used herb in the Libyan culture. However, thepoor knowledge of the participants regarding fenugreek seeds (15%) was somehow unexpected as it is also a well- known and highly consumed herb in Libya. On the one hand, this study revealed that more than half of both pharmacy and medicine students considered the Inter- net and other medical practitioners as their familiar sourcesof information regarding CAM. This was inconsistent with other related studies done in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Sierra Leone. 9,12,13Students stated that they depend on more reliable and formal sources such as university curricula and journals. Overall, the two study groups demonstrated a positive attitude toward CAM, and there was a statistical difference between them according to their mean scores ( p-value \u00bc 0.001). Similarly, another study in Sierra Leone amongmedicine, pharmacy, and nursing students reported a posi- tive attitude, and there was a signi cant difference between medicine and pharmacy students.11Furthermore, a recent study in China found that medical students had a more positive attitude than nonmedical students, and the differ-ence was signi cant. 23However, a study in Pakistan showed no signi cant differences among pharmacy and nonphar- macy students in their attitudes toward CAM.7 In the current study, students exhibited an agreement toward the necessity of pharmacists and physicians beingaware of CAM methods that are common in their societies, and this was also shown by previous studies in Turkey, Kuwait, and Sierra Leone 11,13,24Moreover, the majority of students agreed that patients should inform or consult their doctors about their use of CAM and this nding is also supported by other studies from Kuwait, Oman, andIreland. 25Additionally, a large proportion of participants stated that pharmacists physicians should advise and pro- vide evidence-based information to patients about CAMmethods that are commonly used. A similar nding was also shown by a study conducted in the United Kingdom. 10A further study reported that more than half of the studentsstated they are not well quali ed to provide the proper advice on common CAM methods. 11Theoretically, it is dif - cult for healthcare professionals to know what advice toprovide without evidence and practice guidance available to support their decisions. 10 Regarding the need to include CAM courses in the school 's curriculum, previous comparative studies have supported this view from studies involving pharmacy and nursing students in Oman20and pharmacy and nonpharmacyTable 3 Attitude of respondents toward CAM Statements Scores (mean /C6SD) p-Value Pharmacy students (62) Medicine students (58) Most alternative medicine therapies are ef cacious 3.71 /C61.08 2.85 /C60.91 0.000 There should for CAM therapies 4.61 /C60.73 4.35 /C60.95 0.108 CAM can be harmful to the public health 3.6 /C61.23 3.86 /C61.05 0.279 Healthcare professionals should be able to advise their patients about commonly used CAM methods4.24/C60.99 3.74 /C61.07 0.004 Patients should inform/consult their doctors about their use of CAM4.65/C60.7 4.41 /C60.8 0.048 The use of CAM as an adjuvant to conventional therapy is of bene tt ot h ep a t i e n t3.94/C61.07 3.31 /C61 0.001 Pharmacists and physicians should be aware of CAM types in their countries4.44/C60.86 3.88 /C60.98 0.000 CAM therapies not tested in a scienti c manner should be discouraged3.95/C61.09 4 /C61.06 0.820 CAM should be taught as a separate course in the curriculum4/C61.07 3.36 /C61.18 0.002 CAM should be taught as a training course after graduation4/C60.96 3.6 /C61.01 0.017 Abbreviations: CAM, complementary SD, deviation.

Although pharmacy students exhibited a higher positive attitude than medical students in their beliefs that CAM usage should be discouraged due to the nonscienti cb a s i so f CAM, there was no statistical difference among them. Thisobservation was in contrast to a previous study in Pakistan. 7 On the other hand, medical students had a more positiveattitude than pharmacy students toward the following twostatements; CAM can be harmful, and CAM not tested clinically should be discouraged for use. These ndings are also shown by other students in Saudi Arabia andPakistan. 7,12However, many students in Sierra Leone and China disagreed that CAM can harm public health.11,23 This study is subject to some limitations. The rst is the relatively small sample size, and thereby, data were insuf - cient for a perfectly accurate statistical measurement. Fur- thermore, this survey was conducted at the University ofBenghazi only; hence, these results cannot be generalized to other universities in Libya. Moreover, the current ndings were based on students 'opinions, but CAM practitioners, who might have different views, were omitted. Additionally, the variables affecting students 'responses cannot be determined over time as this survey was a cross-sectional study. Finally, anonline self-administered questionnaire was used. Thus, the results might not represent the exact targeted sample. Conclusion This study showed that CAM was common among seniorpharmacy and medical students, especially with ruquia, cupping, and herbal medicine. Overall, the student 'sk n o w l - edge of CAM was considered limited, and their attitude toward it was positive, with pharmacy students displaying a better degree of both. These results suggest that CAMshould be included as an introductory module in the syllabus of medicine and other health-based science colleges and further improved for those students who already receive it.Moreover, educational programs to increase awareness about the possible uses, risks, and limitations of CAM should be implemented at different public and private healthcarefacilities for both patients and healthcare practitioners.
