Shamans also periodically educate physicians and hospital staff about their beliefs and practices. Key elements of the program include the following: Initial Orientation on Western Medicine Hmong shamans receive a 40-hour intensive orientation on Western medicine where they learn about Western biomedical practices, germ theory, and disease symptomatology; they also tour the hospital, including the operating room, emergency department, labor and delivery room, and laboratory and radiology departments. Once shamans complete the program, they can be called upon to visit Hmong patients at Mercy Medical Center Merced. Shamans are treated as clergy and have hospital badges. They also wear traditional embroidered Hmong jackets to distinguish them from hospital staff and volunteers. At present, 89 shamans have completed the program, one third of whom are women. Coordination of Shaman Visit When a Hmong patient or family member requests a visit from a Hmong shaman, the chaplain or bedside nurse works with a qualified interpreter to enumerate for the patient/family the list of ceremonies approved by the hospital (see below), and then contacts staff from the Healthy House program (which conducts the shaman orientation and oversees the \"Partners in Healing\" program; see Context section for more details) to schedule the visit. Ceremonies Hmong healing ceremonies, which typically last 10 or 15 minutes, involve traditional chants, \"soul calling,\" \"soul tying,\" and blessings that promote protection and healing. Ceremonies are conducted by the shaman in a low voice so as not to disrupt others. Approved ceremonies. The medical center has preapproved 9 ceremonies that can be conducted in the patient's hospital room, emergency department, or preoperative unit. The ceremonies are brief, quiet and do not require a private environment. Nonapproved ceremonies. If a shaman recommends a more extensive ceremony, the chaplain or nurse will contact Healthy House representatives, who then seek approval from physicians, nursing administrators, the hospital's Director of Mission Integration (who oversees the chaplaincy program), and/or other administrators as necessary. Respect for other patients. If the Hmong patient is sharing a room, the chaplain or nurse will describe the ceremony and its approximate length to the roommate and request his/her consent. If the roommate does not provide consent, the nurse will make arrangements to transport the Hmong patient to a private area for the ceremony. Documentation. The request for and provision of the ceremony is documented in the patient's chart. Education of Western Providers During the orientation sessions and in periodic meetings with physicians, shamans, with the help of an interpreter, teach Western providers about Hmong medicine and health beliefs. In addition, a shaman serves on the Mercy Hospital Advisory Board, providing periodic input on policy issues from the perspective of the Hmong community.
