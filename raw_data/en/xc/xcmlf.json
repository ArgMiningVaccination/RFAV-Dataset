She graduated from Bastyr University in 2008 and the Seattle School of Homeopathy in 2010 then was board certified in homeopathy by the Council of Homeopathic Certification (CHC) and the Homeopathic Academy of Naturopathic Physicians (HANP) in 2012. She also held teaching fellow and teaching assistant positions in the homeopathy department of Bastyr University from 2008-2010, taught homeopathy at Bastyr University from 2016-2017, and taught homeopathic clinical skills to homeopathic students in a learning clinic, called Saturday Clinic, from 2017-2019.](https://www.seattlehomeopathy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Jenna9.5.22.jpg) Dr. White practices \"wholistic\" medicine. While homeopathy provides the framework and deep healing that is central to her work, she also works with nutrition and supplementation, herbs and gemmotherapy, and lifestyle and psychotherapeutic counseling to rebuild and restore wellness. Her treatment is comprehensive and tailored to each person's needs. When treating with natural medicine, it's important to work toward finding the right combination to ignite a person's healing potential, just like finding the right key will ignite an engine of a car. Words from Jennifer White During appointments we discuss all the factors of health and dis-ease in your life and I deeply listen for patterns that are present. Time and care are given to understanding you and your condition and how the condition has affected you; equal time and care are given when analyzing the data to understand the dis-ease and develop treatment that will foster your health and stimulate your healing. Health is maintained by living a healthy lifestyle of eating well, drinking clean water, breathing clean air, movement, internal cleansing, stimulating the healing mechanisms within your body, and being connected to the people in your life, your immediate world around you, and your faith. My treatment addresses all these factors of health-care; when we can affect the physical body, mental body, emotional body and spiritual body all together, a deeper restoration of health ensues.
