In the U.S., there are 2 million Americans chronically infected, and liver cancer is one of the nation's deadliest cancers, growing rapidly every year. Now the good news.

To contribute to this Fund or to learn more about how the funds will be used, go to www.hepb.org/joanfund.HEpatitis B is a sErious livEr infEction tHat is a lEading causE of cirrHosis, livEr failurE, and livEr cancEr worldwidE. Approximately\u0007240\u0007million\u0007people\u0007are \u0007 chronically infected with the hepatitis B\u0007virus\u0007(HBV)\u0007and\u0007most\u0007do\u0007not\u0007have \u0007 specific symptoms. The infection may remain active indefinitely or it can resolve spontaneously or by antiviral therapy. Even in cases where the infection appears to have resolved, however, small amounts of virus are found in the liver. This is usually not a health problem unless\u0007the\u0007patient's\u0007immune\u0007system \u0007 becomes\u0007compromised.\u0007When\u0007this \u0007 happens, though, there may be a sudden increase in the growth of the virus that is accompanied by abnormal liver tests. This event is referred to as hepatitis B \"reactivation. \" Reactivation can be potentially serious and accompanied by fatigue, jaundice, need for hospitalization, liver failure and even death. The\u0007highest\u0007risk\u0007for\u0007HBV\u0007reactivation \u0007 occurs when a patient with active or past infection is placed on cancer chemotherapy or undergoes bone marrow transplantation. However, individuals treated for solid organ malignancies such as breast, colon, pancreatic, and thyroid cancer\u0007are\u0007also\u0007at\u0007increased\u0007risk. Another\u0007worrisome\u0007situation\u0007occurs \u0007 when biologically active drugs that suppress the immune system are used for a variety of rheumatic, people in\u0007the\u0007U.S.\u0007are\u0007taking\u0007TNF\u0007inhibitors.\u0007As \u0007 they\u0007can\u0007be\u0007remarkably\u0007effective,\u0007these \u0007 drugs are often used long term during which time the patient presumably remains\u0007at\u0007risk. \u0007 Many patients on TNF inhibitors also\u0007take\u00072 nd or even 3rd immune suppressive drugs which increases the risk\u0007of\u0007reactivation\u0007further.\u0007Reactivation \u0007 can be serious enough to lead to early discontinuation of the immune suppressive\u0007agent(s) \u0007 which can have serious negative effects. Liver specialists have become alarmed by the growing number of cases of HBV reactivation they see because it could have been prevented by HBV screening of patients\u0007prior\u0007to\u0007taking \u0007 immune suppressive drugs followed by the early use of prophylactic antiviral medication, which are very safe and effective in\u0007blocking\u0007the\u0007virus \u0007 and preventing reactivation in more than 85% of cases. The problem is that health providers who prescribe immune suppressive medication often do not test for H B V. For example, it has been estimated that only 30% of oncology doctors routinely screen their patients for HBV before starting cancer chemotherapy. Low rates of screening have been observed in other medical specialties\u0007-\u000760%\u0007for\u0007rheumatologists\u0007and \u0007 40-50%\u0007for\u0007dermatologists. \u0007 The medical society practice guidelines for these specialty providers do not recommend universal HBV screening of every patient (as has been long advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all international liver\u0007associations,\u0007and\u0007the\u0007American \u0007 Gastroenterology\u0007Association).\u0007Instead, \u0007 the practice guidelines either suppose with HBV or recommend targeted\u0007screening\u0007of\u0007patients\u0007with\u0007high-risk\u0007behavior\u0007(e.g.\u0007injecting\u0007drug\u0007use)\u0007or \u0007 birth\u0007in\u0007a\u0007high-risk\u0007region\u0007of\u0007the\u0007world. \u0007Targeted screening has been shown to miss the detection of active or past HBV infection in many instances. Thus,\u0007I\u0007recommend\u0007that\u0007you\u0007discuss \u0007 the need for HBV screening with your health provider or the provider who prescribes the immune suppressive treatment.\u0007 If\u0007the\u0007blood\u0007tests\u0007show\u0007an\u0007active\u0007 HBV infection or past infection, then you should be referred to a liver specialist who can decide whether antiviral therapy is indicated and for how long. asking aBout scrEEning BEforE starting c HEmotHErapy or immunE supprEssivE tHErapy will EmpowEr you to safEguard against HBv rEactivation and its many Harmful EffEcts.

Our new initiative aims to put a human face on hepatitis B to increase public awareness, decrease stigma and discrimination, and promote testing and treatment that will ultimately save lives. Nearly 20 individuals from across the U.S.\u0007have\u0007participated\u0007in\u0007two\u0007interactive \u0007 workshops\u0007facilitated\u0007by\u0007StoryCenter,\u0007a \u0007 nonprofit organization that pioneered the digital storytelling movement. Participants\u0007ranged\u0007from\u000721\u0007to\u000776\u0007years\u0007old \u0007 and each shared their stories that included being newly diagnosed, grieving the loss of a parent from liver cancer, facing the pain of stigma and discrimination, as well as finding the courage to be\u0007'bigger\u0007than\u0007their\u0007diagnosis.'Each story is a powerful reflection of the enormous impact that hepatitis B has on the lives of more than 240 million people around the world.\u0007In\u0007addition,\u0007each #justB storyteller will participate in further training to share their story publicly and become community advocates to end the silence around hepatitis B. The\u0007HBF's\u0007#justB Storytelling program was made possible by educational grants from Arbutus\u0007Biopharma,\u0007Dynavax\u0007Technologies,\u0007and \u0007 a private family foundation.

Urban et al. reported that half of the patients in a phase 2 trial of entry inhibitor Myrcludex B experienced >1 log10 decline in viremia in 24 weeks. The ability of an entry inhibitor to reduce viremia indicates that HBV infection is more dynamic than had been assumed, and curative therapies employing direct-acting\u0007inhibitors\u0007may\u0007take\u0007less\u0007time\u0007than \u0007 is widely believed.

(Penn\u0007State\u0007U.)\u0007reported efforts of a multi-group consortium to optimize and standardize methods for compelling evidence that HBV infection of hepatocytes does not activate innate immune response. However, studies\u0007from\u0007S.\u0007Urban's\u0007laboratory\u0007indicate \u0007 that HDV infection pharmacological STING in hepatocytes efficiently suppresses HBV replication , which could be meeting. 2017 HBV Meeting Registration Open!

A Vietnamese woman working in a hotel in Dubai is found to have hepatitis B and is fired, isolated, deported and banned from ever re-entering the country. A young college student in China is diagnosed with hepatitis B so the school moves her to an isolation room and she loses her friends; ultimately, she commits suicide. Two American students are accepted into medical school and their offers are rescinded when they test positive for hepatitis B on their physical entrance exams. A young man is given 24 hours to leave a U.S. military educational institution after he tests positive for hepatitis B. Discrimination is especially severe in some Middle Eastern countries. The young woman exiled from Dubai, wrote to the Hepatitis B Foundation for support: \" When I was 21, I had my internship in Dubai and needed to undergo a blood test. I was not aware of the rules in that country so when I tested positive, the hotel where I worked isolated me. I was going through a very hard time because I was completely alone in a foreign country. My work visa was canceled, they brought me to a place that looked like a jail, and I was deported with a lifetime ban. That was the most horrible memory in my life. I am still scared every time I think about it. Sometimes I cannot sleep at night, I keep blaming, cursing myself for having this kind of virus inside my body.\" In the U.S., progress has been made to end hepatitis B discrimination. In 2012, prompted by the Hepatitis B Foundation and the many stories of discrimination against healthcare students they were fielding, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) updated its guidelines for infected healthcare workers and students and clearly stated that, \"hepatitis B infection alone should not disqualify infected persons from the practice or study of surgery, dentistry, medicine, or allied health fields.\" The updated CDC guidelines were the cornerstone of a successful U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) settlement with a New Jersey medical school that rescinded their acceptance offers to two students who tested positive for hepatitis B on their physical exams. Because of the DOJ settlement, hepatitis B is now a protected condition under the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). But discrimination persists. The U.S. military prohibits people with hepatitis B from enlisting. Yet, since 2002 all recruits are vaccinated and protected against hepatitis B. Since most young people with chronic hepatitis B infections are healthy and able to perform all duties required by the military, there is no need for discrimination. The stories are heartbreaking, and despite many efforts by the Hepatitis B Foundation to work with Congressional champions to request that the Department of Defense update their policy, it's a tough, uphill battle. Hepatitis B-related discrimination is unethical, unnecessary and a violation of human rights. The stigma that perpetuates this discrimination springs from ignorance and impacts millions daily. With advances in the prevention and control of hepatitis B, there is no reason to deny people their dreams, education, careers, and income just because they happen to live with this disease.NONPROFIT ORG u.S.
