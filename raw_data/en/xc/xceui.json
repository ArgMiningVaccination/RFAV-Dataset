These can include using sunflower seed oil, taking an oatmeal bath, applying petroleum jelly, and more. Dry skin, also called xerosis, is skin that lacks moisture in its outer layer. If left untreated, dry skin can crack and become infected. Keeping dry skin moisturized is important, but some store-bought treatments can be expensive or ineffective. This article explores home remedies for dry skin and looks at the scientific evidence behind the claims. There are a variety of home remedies a person can use to relieve dry skin. Most of the treatments below can be used as moisturizers unless otherwise stated. The best way to use a moisturizer is to apply it liberally to damp skin after a bath and let it soak in. 1. Sunflower seed oil A [2013 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22995032) The same study found that olive oil actually damaged the skin's barrier, suggesting not all natural oils are suitable for use as moisturizers. 2. Coconut oil Another natural oil that works well to treat dry skin is [coconut oil](/articles/282857.php). A [2014 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15724344) As [2016 research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/) 3. Oatmeal bath Oatmeal is another natural ingredient that can help treat dry skin. Adding powdered oatmeal to a bath or using creams that contain oatmeal may help to relieve dry skin. A [2015 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25607907) 4. Drinking milk Milk could also offer relief from dry skin, but not when applied to the skin. [Research from 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25816721) The study found that a fat contained in milk, called phospholipid, improved the skin barrier in mice when added to their diet. More research is needed to see if drinking milk has the same effect on skin in humans. 5. Honey A [2012 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3611628/) Various studies have found honey to be: - moisturizing - healing - anti-inflammatory These are all qualities that suggest honey is an ideal at home treatment to relieve dry skin.

Aloe vera Aloe vera gel may help provide relief from dry skin, according to a [2003 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12548256) A person with dry skin on their hands or feet can apply aloe vera gel and cover the affected area with a sock or glove. People may prefer to do this before they go to bed and leave the gel on all night. If dry skin is on another area of the body, applying aloe vera gel liberally and allowing it to soak in may achieve a similar effect. Applying emollients and moisturizers regularly after bathing helps prevent dry skin. People can also prevent dry skin by avoiding things that may trigger dryness or irritation, including: - scratching their skin - excessive air conditioning - shaving using a blunt razor or without shaving gel - bathing or showering too often - rubbing skin too hard when towel drying - bathing or showering in water that is too hot - using lotions that contain alcohol - wearing clothes that rub the skin - frequent contact with detergents - sitting under direct heat from a heater or fire - staying outside in windy conditions without covering the skin If environmental factors or aging is not the cause of dry skin, a person may have an underlying skin condition. If a person suspects this is the case, then they should speak to a doctor. If home remedies and store-bought moisturizers do not alleviate the symptoms of dry skin, a person may also wish to speak to a pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments. It is important to keep skin moisturized and to treat dry skin as soon as possible.
