The SOUL MIND BODY MEDICINE BOOK is the one that outlines the healing process that you use to heal yourself or others. It is clearly written with photo illustrations of each technique and a clear description of each healing modality. I have had difficult with the language but hopefully will eventually get so I can pronounce the Chinese words necessary. the main thing every reader should know is that the techniques really work. This is a alternative medicine that you can do for your self and others. I was fortunate to get into the Voice of America Radio program on November 16,07 at 8:00 PM and was selected to work directly with Dr Sha and his advanced students. He gave me a copy of his most recent book on Soul Language and I will review it here as soon as I read it. Actually I plan to review each book here ASAP. If you wish to go directly listen with my personal transaction with Dr sha and his students you may go directly to Voice of America Radio. If you wish to purchase any of his books let me know and i will list them on ebay so you can purchase them with a buy it now,then I will send that money to the Soul Mind Body Institute. If you are ill and cannot afford to purchase a this book let me know and I will ask someone to gift you one. I will gift you one if I have a copy. Dr sha knows my funds are limited and he was very gracious letting me participate in his programs and has made sure I have his books for my studies. I also have a hang up when it comes to paying for healing. I will get into that in more detail later.All I know is that if you are ill you should consider this healing modality before running up a bunch of medical bills and expenses. Once you start on that Western model you may exhaust all your resources quickly and the stress of the loss will kill you if the disease you have doesn't first. I have seen this happen to folks again and again. I hate to tell you but Michael Moore and his film SICKO has pulled the rug of of this gaping wound in our medical care system and most of us will need to turn to these alternative medicines to survive. Dr Sha has worked with masses of Chinese people because they do not have enough Drs to go around. He has been extremely effective in saving lives in China and now else where in the World. My Brother in Law has just found out he has a pancreatic tumor his wife my sister has recently undergone treatment for tumors in her brain. I ask you all for your prayers or any information that you know will help them to heal. The Medical Drs are struggling with the answers and he has already been operated on to no avail. I am going to help him with this new knowledge from Dr Sha but I am not very skilled yet at healing and i got some Western Medicine hangups of myy own to over come before I can be confident in this new technique and technology as presented by Dr Sha. Please also rate this review so I can tell if I should continue writing reviews on this subject. You may wish to read my other reviews and Guides listed under my business name Mocassinman.My nickname is Woody,given name Clarence William Gillispie from Dublin Michigan. If you want to learn practical healing metho...ds, a little about Tao and a little about Chinese Medicine this is the book. Easy to understand methods that apply to everyone. Master She has a loving approach to healing as well as being a powerful Chinese Master. He's the real thing. I recommend all of his books.
