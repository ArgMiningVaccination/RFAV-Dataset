Vaccine components and PF4 form complexes on platelet surfaces to which VITT patient antibodies bind. Abstract SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 thrombocytopenia (VITT). Using biophysical techniques, mouse models, and analysis of VITT patient samples, we identified determinants of this vaccine-induced adverse reaction. Super-resolution microscopy visualized vaccine components forming antigenic complexes with platelet factor 4 (PF4) on platelet surfaces to which anti-PF4 antibodies obtained from VITT patients bound. PF4/vaccine complex formation was charge-driven and increased by addition of DNA. Proteomics identified substantial amounts of virus production-derived T-REx HEK293 proteins in the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing vaccine. Injected vaccine increased vascular leakage in mice, leading to systemic dissemination of vaccine components known to stimulate immune responses. Together, PF4/vaccine complex formation and the vaccine-stimulated proinflammatory milieu trigger a pronounced B-cell response that results in the formation of high-avidity anti-PF4 antibodies in VITT patients. The resulting high-titer anti-PF4 antibodies potently activated platelets in the presence of PF4 or DNA and polyphosphate polyanions. Anti-PF4 VITT patient antibodies also stimulated neutrophils extracellular traps (NETs) in a platelet PF4-dependent manner. Biomarkers of procoagulant NETs were elevated in VITT patient serum, and NETs were visualized in abundance by immunohistochemistry in cerebral vein thrombi obtained from VITT patients. Together, vaccine-induced PF4/adenovirus aggregates and proinflammatory reactions stimulate pathologic anti-PF4 antibody production that drives thrombosis in VITT. The data support a 2-step mechanism underlying VITT that resembles the pathogenesis of (autoimmune) heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Introduction Vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an important countermeasure to fight the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The European Medicines Agency has approved 2 adenoviral (AV) vector-based vaccines: recombinant chimpanzee AV [ChAdOx1-S] vector SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca [ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; Vaxzevria]; human AV type 26 vector encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. ChAdOx1-S is propagated using T-REx HEK293 cells, a transformed human embryonic kidney cell line. [1](javascript:;) Beginning in March 2021, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), splanchnic vein thrombosis, and other unusual severe thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia were reported in otherwise healthy individuals beginning 5 to 20 days following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. This novel with high-titer immunoglobulin G (IgG) class antibodies directed by PF4. [2,3](javascript:;) Pathologic anti-PF4 antibodies were infrequently found in CVST patients prior to VITT, suggesting that the vaccine-induced antibodies drive these thrombotic complications. [4](javascript:;) PF4 opsonizes negatively charged surfaces of microbial pathogens, facilitating binding of anti-PF4 antibodies. [5](javascript:;) This is likely an evolutionary ancient immune defense mechanism. [6-8](javascript:;) However, a misdirected strong anti-PF4 antibody response underlies disorder immune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT; caused by anti-PF4/heparin antibodies) and its most severe presentation, autoimmune HIT. [9-12](javascript:;) This latter subtype of HIT is characterized by the formation of high-avidity platelet-activating anti-PF4 antibodies that are reactive even in the absence of heparin. [13](javascript:;) HIT proceeds by a 2-step mechanism: initially, PF4/heparin complexes expose a neoantigen on PF4 that stimulates B cells to produce high-affinity anti-PF4/heparin antibodies in the presence of proinflammatory costimuli. Five to 10 days following heparin exposure, sufficient quantities of these antibodies are present to activate cellular Fc receptors on platelets, monocytes, and granulocytes, culminating in life-threatening thrombosis. Major risk factors for forming anti-PF4 antibodies and for developing HIT are inflammation and tissue trauma. Both disease states provide immunologic \"danger signals\" that increase the likelihood and intensity of forming an anti-PF4 immune response. [14,15](javascript:;) Marginal zone B cells mediate anti-PF4/heparin antibody production in HIT, and their activation depends on Notch-2 signaling. [16-18](javascript:;) Although anti-PF4/heparin antibodies develop commonly after heparin exposure, only a small subset of heparin-sensitized patients develop thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. Despite decades of research, comprehensive insight into the factors that predispose to adverse heparin-induced immune thrombotic events has remained enigmatic. [19](javascript:;) VITT closely mimics autoimmune HIT both clinically and serologically [20](javascript:;); however, the nature of neoantigens that trigger pathologic anti-PF4 antibodies, the \"danger signal(s)\" that prime for adverse immune reactions and prothrombotic mechanisms, remains to be established in VITT. Here, we identify key components of VITT immunopathogenesis. The data suggest that VITT proceeds via a 2-step mechanism: (1) Vaccine components, including the AV hexon protein, form complexes with PF4, leading to neoantigen exposure on PF4. Vaccine components also have the capability to trigger proinflammatory responses that are \"danger signals\" known to amplify anti-PF4 antibody production in autoimmune HIT. (2) Between days 5-20 postvaccination, anti-PF4 antibodies from VITT patients activate platelets in a PF4- and polyanion-dependent manner. Additionally, anti-PF4 antibodies activate granulocytes in the presence of platelets to release procoagulant neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that are found in abundance in CVSTs of VITT patients. Together, the data highlight similarities in VITT and HIT pathogenesis and identify strategies to interfere with VITT-driven thrombotic events. Methods Detailed description of antibodies, reagents, and additional methods can be found in supplemental Methods (available on the Blood Web site). 3D super-resolution microscopy For three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution microscopy imaging of platelets and immobilized ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, coverslips were mounted inversely in Mowiol (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) or Everspark buffer (Idylle Labs, Paris, France) for direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) localization microscopy. 3D super-resolution microscopy imaging was either performed at NIPOKA GmbH, Greifswald, Germany on a Nikon N-SIM E system (Nikon Instruments, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with 488 and 640 nm laser lines and a 100x 1.35NA silicon immersion objective, or on a system equipped with a 63x 1.4NA oil-immersion objective. Raw image stacks with 3 rotations and 5 shifts of the illumination grating were acquired and reconstructed as super-resolved 3D SIM datasets as described. [21](javascript:;) Reconstructed data were saved as .nd or .czi files and imported to FIJI [22](javascript:;) using the BioFormats importer. Chromatic aberration was corrected using analogous prepared reference slides coated with 100 nm Tetraspek beads diluted 1:2000 in ultrapure water. Data were analyzed using customized FIJI and NIS scripts. Full dSTORM super-resolution imaging methods are given in supplemental Methods. Dynamic light scattering All dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed in a fixed scattering angle Zetasizer Nano-S system (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, United Kingdom). The hydrodynamic diameter (nm) was measured at 25\u00b0C, and light scattering was detected at 173\u00b0 using 3 repeating measurements consisting of 12 runs. Experimental data were collected from 4 independent experimental replicates. For all DLS measurements, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was diluted ratio in catalog no. 9097.1; Carl Roth GmbH, Germany). Assessment of changes in the hydrodynamic diameter of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vector in the presence of PF4 was performed by incubating 10 \u00b5g/mL of human PF4 (Chromatec, Greifswald, Germany) with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vector at room temperature (RT) for 2 minutes before DLS measurements. Anti-PF4 mouse VITT sera, and control human IgG from a healthy individual were purified by Protein G affinity purification and were used at 5 \u00b5g/mL final concentration. Double-stranded annealed DNA 25-mer was used at 0.5 \u00b5g/mL. Dissociation of complexes formed between ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vector and added components was achieved by 100 IU/mL unfractionated heparin (UFH; Ratiopharm GmbH, Ulm, Germany). Transmission electron For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the vaccine was in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]; PF4-biotin) for at least 1 hour at RT. The sample was transferred to formvar-coated TEM grids (400 mesh; Plano GmbH, Germany), washed with PBS, and blocked with bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Samples mAb (B025/AD51, ab7428, 1:500; Abcam, Waltham, MA) for 1 hour at RT and detected with an anti-mouse gold conjugate secondary antibody (GMHL10, 10 nm, 1:50; BBI Solutions). Alternatively, for PF4-biotin staining, the same samples were labeled with a streptavidin-gold conjugate (10 nm, 1:10; Sigma) for 45 minutes at RT. All grids were stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid at pH 7.4 and analyzed with a Tecnai-Spirit (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. The same procedure was used for preparing control samples of vaccine alone and PF4-biotin. The vaccine was also incubated with heparin (100 IU/mL) for 30 minutes. After that, samples were transferred to formvar-coated TEM grids (400 mesh; Plano GmbH) and Composition of ChAdOx1 CoV-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 CoV-19 vaccine was analyzed electrophoresis methods are given in supplemental Methods). Platelet activation assay with washed platelets (PIPA test) Platelet activation and aggregation by VITT patient serum were tested as previously described. [2](javascript:;) In brief, washed platelets of at least 3 healthy donors were incubated in the absence or presence of either PF4 (10 mg/mL), DNA (ds 25-mer, 1 \u00b5g/mL), or EDTA (0.2 \u00b5M) and serum from VITT patients under stirring conditions. Therefore, 75 \u00b5L platelet suspension was mixed with 20 \u00b5L serum prior to stirring. The time to aggregation was measured up to 45 minutes. The test was determined to be positive if platelets aggregated within 30 minutes. Immunofluorescence staining and confocal imaging of cerebral sinus vein thrombus For visualization of NETs within cerebral sinus vein thrombi, 5 \u00b5m paraffin sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated prior to antigen retrieval using sodium citrate. Slides were blocked in 2% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 45 minutes at RT, followed by incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing 3 times with PBS, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies for 60 minutes at RT before further washing and quenching autofluorescence with 0.1% Sudan Black B in 70% ethanol for 25 minutes. Sections were washed again and covered with Dako fluorescence mounting medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). For visualization of NETs, 100 \u00b5m transverse vibratome sections of a cerebral sinus vein thrombus from a VITT patient and a nonvaccinated control patient were permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 minutes at RT, followed by blocking with 3% BSA in PBSTx for 2 hours. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed 3 times with PBSTx, and subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C before further washing and mounting in Dako fluorescence mounting medium. The following AlexaFluor-488 and 594 were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (all donkey, used in 1:200 dilution). Confocal tissue images represent maximum intensity projections of z stacks that were acquired using a Leica SP8 inverted confocal microscope with 10x HC PL APO CS and 63x HC PL APO Oil CS2 objectives and Leica LAS-X software. Results ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine constituents and VITT patient anti-PF4 IgG ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination is associated with delayed local and systemic reactions after the first administration indicating immunogenic reactions triggered by vaccine components. [23](javascript:;) We analyzed interactions of vaccine constituents with blood by biophysical techniques. 3D super-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy visualized platelets ( [Figure 1A](javascript:;), upper left panel), as well as between AV particles and PF4 ( [Figure 1A](javascript:;), lower left panel). These interactions led to complexes comprised of vaccine particles and PF4 to which VITT ( [Figure 1A](javascript:;), right panel). Quantification of the components of the particles revealed that 45% contained ternary complexes of PF4, AV hexon proteins, and anti-PF4 antibodies, whereas 50% were positive for PF4/AV hexon protein were recognized by VITT patient antibodies: Addition of PF4 (diameter 5 nm [24](javascript:;)) to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine increased the size of AV particles from 105.5 \u00b1 2.8 nm to 185.2 \u00b1 44.5 nm (mean diameter \u00b1 standard complexes to 288.4 \u00b1 10.4 nm and 288.5 \u00b1 13.9 nm, respectively. Adding DNA further increased the size of VITT patient antibody/PF4/ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 complexes dissociated 98.5% of complexes. As an indication of charge-driven complex formation of vaccine components with PF4, surface potential of the vaccine particles was negative (12 \u00b1 4.2 mV), and the addition of PF4, but not heparin, neutralized their negative charge (-5.2 and mV, respectively; [Figure 1D](javascript:;)). Consistent with DLS, TEM visualized AV particles and small amorphous structures contained in the vaccine ( [Figure 1E](javascript:;)). Larger aggregates formed upon incubation of the vaccine with PF4. The aggregates stained positive for AV hexon polypeptide and PF4 ( [Figure and derived anti-PF4 antibodies specifically detected PF4 alone or PF4 in a mixture with the vaccine; however, there was no detectable signal with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine alone. Similarly, anti-AV hexon protein antibodies stained the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine alone or in mixture with PF4; however, they did not bind to PF4 alone (supplemental Figure 2). The data reveal charge-driven complex formation of PF4 and AV hexon proteins, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination-induced mice and humans We hypothesized that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine induces a proinflammatory \"danger signal\" that promotes pathologic anti-PF4 antibody production in autoimmune HIT and possibly in VITT. [25,26](javascript:;) Accordingly, we sought to characterize the vaccine composition. Unexpectedly, we found 70-80 \u00b5g protein/mL in 4 independent ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine lots Silver staining of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine separated on SDS-PAGE showed numerous protein bands ( [Figure 2A](javascript:;)). Proteomics identified AV vector proteins (blue dots), virus production-derived T-REx HEK293 (human) proteins (gray dots) (some constituting membrane proteins [green dots]), and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (red dot) in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Approximately 43% to 60% of the protein content of the vaccine (15-24 \u00b5g per dose) was assigned to T-REx HEK293 cell origin ( [Figure 2B](javascript:;); supplemental [Close modal](javascript:;) We further analyzed the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine for small molecules by 1H-NMR spectrometry and identified EDTA (100 \u00b5M; [Figure 3A](javascript:;)). Leaky vessels are a hallmark of inflammation, and the Ca2+ chelator vaccine for inducing proinflammatory reactions in mice using the Miles edema model ( [Figure 3B](javascript:;)). Intradermally injected vaccine triggered leakage in dermal vessels that was quantified by Evans Blue tracer extravasation. Increase of vascular permeability appeared mostly mediated by EDTA in the vaccine, as intradermal injection of EDTA alone (100 \u00b5M) stimulated vascular leakage to a similar extent as the vaccine. Moreover, reconstituting the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and EDTA with Ca2+ prior intradermal injection prevented vaccine- and EDTA-triggered increases in permeability and vascular leakage (supplemental Figure 3). We assessed consequences of EDTA-induced local vascular leakage for dissemination of vaccine components in challenged mice. The vast majority of the intradermally-injected AV DNA remained at the injection site (>99.99% at 30 minutes postinjection, supplemental Figure 4). However, digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected ChAdOx1 nCoV-19-specific sequences in multiple tissues including the brain, as well as the spleen, where B cells are enriched in the splenic marginal zones [28,29](javascript:;) ( [Figure 3C](javascript:;)). [Close modal](javascript:;) Consistent with the dissemination of vaccine constituents in the mouse model, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination triggered systemic inflammatory reactions in humans. Out of 22 healthy, vaccinated health care workers, 12 reported adverse effects including fever, chills, and joint pain starting 6-12 hours after vaccination, usually resulting in 1 to 2 days of sick leave. A representative example of skin inflammation associated with high levels of D-Dimer (1,115 ng/mL) indicating proinflammatory reactions at days 1-2 after vaccination is shown in [Figure 3D](javascript:;). Taken together, the data are consistent with a model of neoantigen formation induced by vaccine constituents and PF4, which jointly stimulate pathologic anti-PF4 antibody formation facilitated by a vaccine-triggered inflammatory costimulus. Pathologic anti-PF4 antibodies activate platelets and neutrophils, leading to thrombosis We next analyzed for thrombotic reactions triggered by VITT patient anti-PF4 antibodies. Consistent with our previously published data, [2](javascript:;) all (14/14) sera of VITT patients analyzed, as well as their respective affinity-purified antibody fractions, showed strong reactivity toward immobilized PF4/heparin in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). a aggregation-based assay, addition of PF4 amplified platelet activation by VITT patient a 0.2 (1 \u00b5g/mL) increased VITT patient serum-initiated platelet activation, albeit to a extent compared with PF4. VITT patient serum/PF4-stimulated platelet aggregation was completely blockade using IV.3 antibody ( [Figure 4B](javascript:;)). Taken together, the data indicate function IgG/PF4 complexes antibodies of HIT patients activate neutrophils and are a major driver of thrombosis by the formation of procoagulant NETs (NETosis). [31](javascript:;) We tested pathologic anti-PF4 antibodies of VITT patients for their potency to trigger neutrophil activation and procoagulant NET formation in the presence of PF4 or platelets. Incubation of isolated human neutrophils and platelets with VITT patient serum induced NET formation ( [Figure 5A](javascript:;)) that was significantly increased by the addition of PF4 ( [Figure 5B,K](javascript:;)). In contrast, healthy control serum did trigger NET formation ( [Figure 5C,D,K](javascript:;)). Similar to VITT patient serum, 5E,K](javascript:;)). PF4 addition strongly enhanced PF4 virtually absent when neutrophils and platelets were coincubated in buffer, in the absence or presence of added PF4 ( [Figure 5G-H](javascript:;)). In the absence of platelets, VITT patient serum failed to induce NETosis even in the presence of added PF4, suggesting that in VITT platelets play a key role in triggering NET formation ( [Figure 5I-J](javascript:;)). [Close modal](javascript:;) Supporting a role 3 NET biomarkers: cell-free DNA, citrullinated histones, and MPO (marker for neutrophil activation), were elevated in VITT patient sera compared with healthy controls ( [Figure 6A-C](javascript:;)). CVST is a hallmark complication reported in many VITT patients. We analyzed the composition of cerebral sinus vein thrombi obtained by thrombectomy from 1 VITT patient or by autopsy from a second VITT patient, respectively. Histology of the thrombectomy-derived tissue showed regions with amorphous material, likely representing fibrin deposition surrounded by throughout [Figure 6D](javascript:;)). that these cell-rich areas contained abundant activated neutrophils and NETs. Antibodies against the NET biomarker thrombus. A highly similar NET staining pattern was observed in a cerebral sinus vein thrombus of a second VITT patient obtained at the time of autopsy, whereas cerebral sinus vein thrombus regions from a nonvaccinated control patient contained less neutrophils (supplemental Figure 5). Together, for the first time the data visualize NETs in VITT-induced cerebral sinus vein thrombosis, indicating a causal relationship of NET prothrombotic mechanisms and VITT. [Close modal](javascript:;) Discussion Based on a combination of biophysical imaging, mouse models, and analysis of VITT patient material, our study suggests a 2-step mechanism underlying VITT-driven thrombosis that is schematically shown in [Figure 7](javascript:;). VITT pathogenesis is reminiscent of autoimmune HIT pathology. Initially, neoantigens are generated by interaction of PF4 with vaccine components. As visualized by TEM, 3D super-resolution microscopy, and DLS, in reconstituted systems PF4 has the capacity to bind to vaccine constituents, leading to the formation of complexes that contain AV proteins ( [Figure 1](javascript:;); supplemental Figures 1 and 2). Although PF4/vaccine aggregates are exposed on platelet surfaces and recognized ex vivo by VITT patient anti-PF4 antibodies, the precise sequence of events occurring in vivo at injection sites or in blood requires additional studies. In humans, PF4 is enriched at the vessel wall and is locally released in high concentrations following platelet activation. [32,33](javascript:;) Consistent with our imaging data, previous studies have shown that coronaviruses have the capacity to activate platelets [34,35](javascript:;) and that AVs binding to platelets can lead to platelet-activation and release of PF4. [36](javascript:;) AV aggregates bind to platelet surfaces and are transported via the bloodstream to the spleen, where they are phagocytosed by macrophages, ultimately inducing a pronounced B-cell activation in the marginal zone and follicles in mice. [29](javascript:;) In line with the animal model findings, we visualized an interaction of AV-derived hexon proteins, PF4, and VITT patient-derived anti-PF4 by 3 independent techniques ( [Figure 1](javascript:;)). Our observations suggest that AV binding to PF4 likely induces conformational changes in PF4 and creates potential neoantigen(s). Consistent with the hypothesis that VITT antibodies target neoantigen(s) in PF4, VITT patient anti-PF4 antibodies bind to PF4 following immobilization on plastic surfaces. PF4 binding to surfaces is known to induce conformational changes. [37](javascript:;) Additionally, mutagenesis studies have shown not concept, as high-affinity anti-PF4 antibodies also cluster PF4, even in the absence of polyanions, and induce platelet activation in atypical HIT. [13](javascript:;) In addition to AV proteins, we found substantial amounts (43% to 60% by content) of nonviral proteins originating from the T-REx (RRID:CVCL_D585) human production cell line. [29](javascript:;) HEK293 cells lack tissue-specific gene expression signature and express an array of markers of renal progenitor, neuronal, and adrenal gland cells with undefined immunogenicity. [39](javascript:;) by intramuscular injection of 15-24 \u00b5g T-REx HEK293 proteins per vaccination dose remain to be established. In addition, vaccine protein contaminants have the potential to induce an acute inflammatory cosignal that enhances B-cell responses (immunologic \"danger signal\"). [15,40,41](javascript:;) Synergistically, disseminated viral proteins potently activate innate immune reactions supporting early inflammatory reactions following vaccination. [15,40,41](javascript:;) The inflammatory response provides a costimulus for anti-PF4 antibody production by preformed B cells in HIT. [8,14](javascript:;) Consistently, western blotting revealed that vaccination increased titers of preexisting antibodies that bind to an array of vaccine components separated by SDS-PAGE. Additionally, the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine contains EDTA, with the capacity for increasing capillary leakage at the inoculation site by a VE-cadherin-dependent pathway. [27](javascript:;) Disruption of the endothelial barrier facilitates dissemination of vaccine constituents into the circulation ( [Figure 3](javascript:;)). Alternatively, accidental intravenous injection may contribute to vaccine dissemination. [39](javascript:;) Furthermore, viruses can reach tissues distant from their infection site by invading endothelial cells and gaining access into the extravascular space. Viruses can also be transported across the vascular wall or be cotransported in infected immune cells such as neutrophils, which have the capacity to transmigrate through the endothelial barrier. [42](javascript:;) Systemic dissemination of vaccine components is not unique to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; consistent with our murine model data ( [Figure 3B](javascript:;)), another ChAdOx1 vector variant (with a hepatitis B vector insert) was detectable in multiple organs, including liver, heart, and lymph nodes, at days 2 and 29 after intramuscular injection in mice. [43](javascript:;) Similar to HIT pathology, [18](javascript:;) marginal zone B cells stimulated by PF4/vaccine neoantigens in the presence of inflammatory costimuli produce the pathogenic anti-PF4 antibodies underlying VITT. The detailed role of marginal zone B cells in anti-PF4 VITT antibody production and the mode of exposure of PF4/vaccine neoantigens ( [Figure 1A](javascript:;)) remains to be established in patients [39](javascript:;); however, in murine models an intravenous vaccine injection induces a pronounced B-cell immune response. [29](javascript:;) At day 5 to 20 postvaccination, pathologic anti-PF4 antibodies reach high titers and are capable of clustering PF4 on platelet surfaces activating Anti-PF4 mediated platelet is also a central mechanism for platelet activation in autoimmune HIT. [13](javascript:;) Cross-talk of PF4, activated platelets, and VITT anti-PF4 antibodies 5](javascript:;)). NETs are degraded by [44](javascript:;) DNA was NETs binds PF4. [45](javascript:;) The resulting PF4/DNA complexes create an additional target for anti-PF4 antibodies and increase the resistance of NETs to DNase-mediated degradation, further amplifying their procoagulant activity. [46](javascript:;) This sequence of events [31,46](javascript:;) culminates in massive Fc receptor-dependent activation of neutrophils, platelets, and, by analogy with autoimmune HIT, likely also monocytes and endothelial cells. [47](javascript:;) Consistent with our data in VITT patients, activated neutrophils and NETs contribute to venous thrombosis in HIT mouse models, and HIT antibodies selectively bind PF4-NET complexes. [46](javascript:;) The bimodal distribution of the neutrophil activation marker serum MPO observed in healthy controls ( [Figure 6C](javascript:;)) may reflect the impact of smoking and hormonal contraceptive use, both of which increase MPO enzyme levels. [48](javascript:;) Broadened reactivity of antibodies in a boosted immune response is the hallmark of other immune disorders besides VITT. Patients with severe COVID-19 often have anti-NET autoantibodies, which likely impair NET clearance and may potentiate SARS-CoV-2-mediated thromboinflammation. [49,50](javascript:;) Autoimmune HIT often to heparin-independent hyperreactivity. [9](javascript:;) Similarly, posttransfusion purpura reflects a strong alloimmune response that progresses to include platelet-autoreactive properties. [51](javascript:;) In this regard, the numerous cell culture-derived human proteins in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine ( [Figure 2](javascript:;)) we have identified raise concern. If such proteins express immunogenic structures (eg, a genetic polymorphism absent in the corresponding endogenous protein of the vaccinated individual), an alloimmune response with potential for autoreactivity in a susceptible vaccine recipient requires attention. Protein impurities and adverse immune reactions are not unique to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Xenogeneic antigens derived from the growth matrix used in the virus manufacturing process have been identified by mass spectrometry in swine influenza vaccines. [52,53](javascript:;) Bioprocess impurities, originating from the production cell line of a bovine-virus diarrhea vaccine-induced alloreactive antibodies causing feto-maternal incompatibility with severe thrombocytopenia in calves. [54](javascript:;) In humans, narcolepsy has been associated with Pandemrix influenza vaccine; however, the underlying immune mechanisms remain to be completely understood. [55,56](javascript:;) Our study has limitations; detailed specifications of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine are not publicly available, and we focused on identification of protein and some small molecule content without claiming completeness. Additionally, we have not investigated the specific roles of B cells or T cells in the VITT immune response, nor a potential contribution of the complement system that is known to contribute to immunogenicity and downstream thrombosis in HIT. [57-59](javascript:;) VITT is a rare adverse event with thrombosis occurring in 1 out of 30 000 to 50 000 vaccinated people. We currently can only speculate on the low incidence of VITT by drawing parallels to HIT, an adverse reaction that occurs only in a small subset of heparin-exposed individuals (1 to 100 to 1 in 1000 patients receiving UFH). VITT appears to share similarities with atypical HIT, as the latter is even more rare (<1 in 100 HIT cases), with similar approximate incidence (in the range of 1:100 000 cases) as VITT occurrence. Similar to current knowledge of HIT pathogenesis, definitive identification of risk factors for developing VITT remains challenging. Also in other adverse immune reactions, (eg, severe drug-dependent immune thrombocytopenia following treatment with antibiotics such as vancomycin), only a small fraction of treated individuals develop adverse effects, and underlying mechanisms have remained enigmatic. Furthermore, predominant localization of VITT-associated thrombi in cerebral sinus veins has remained puzzling. Preliminary findings based on systems biology and transcriptomics [60](javascript:;) indicate low DNASE1 expression in central nervous system endothelial cells that can potentially lead to increased half-life and persistent procoagulant activity of NETs. However, the hypothesis requires additional human subjects and experimental confirmation. Together, our data provide insight into the mechanisms by which the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 initiates immune responses, leading to pathogenic anti-PF4 antibodies that trigger downstream prothrombotic reactions. Our findings have implications for the development of AV vector vaccines with improved patient safety.
