I am here to help you take control of your health, and support you to identify the root causes of disease and imbalances. Natural healthcare is my passion and I have studied a variety of techniques including Herbal and nutritional supplements as well as Nutrition, which allows me to treat people in a truly holistic way. My holistic approach is scientifically backed and delivered with personalised care to integrate conventional medicine with complementary medicine such as homeopathy, nutrition and supplementation under the expert advice of a healthcare professional. The most rewarding and profound experience has been my qualification as a Homeopath, which has given me an ability to see the influence of suppressed emotions on our physical health. This helps me to understand in depth psychosomatic disorders where patients often feel misunderstood by conventional medicine. My practice in natural health and homeopathy is about placing the patient at the center of care, and empowering them to take charge of their wellbeing. I believe that every person is unique, and has a different way of healing themselves. My job is to help you understand your symptoms, how they might be related to specific imbalances in your body, and then work with you to find an effective treatment plan. As a holistic practitioner, I'm able to guide and support people in their journey to discover the best version of themselves. What is homeopathy?

I am a fully qualified and General Pharmaceutical Council registered pharmacist, offering an Integrated approach in health in Bath.

My aim is to bring complete balance to the body through natural treatment approaches including diet, supplements and herbal remedies. If you want to experience a better quality of life, then I can help. Homeopathy is a system that approaches health in a holistic way. Our bodies are constantly changing and adapting to our environment, food and thoughts - which is why it's crucial to understand how to listen to your body and work with it rather than against it. I specialise in supporting people with chronic diseases, where an altered immunity response and a chronic inflammatory state are the triggers. I create a complete treatment plan, tailored to your individual needs; for almost 2 hours I will gather information about about your lifestyle, eating habits, personality, sleep patterns and medical history that will help to form a complete picture of you and your health goals. I will then provide you with a plan that will include: I am a registered pharmacist with expertise in both in conventional medicine and natural integrative health, which allows me to understand possible interactions and advice with confidence the best and safest approach even for those already on conventional pharmacological treatments. I am a healthcare professional and I will not interfere with your treatment prescribed from your doctor as I'm aware of the importance of not interrupting any medical treatment without consulting the doctor first. Furthermore, when using pharmacological treatment we must be aware of possible interactions when prescribing dietary supplements. My medical background allows me to suggest with confidence the safest options for my patients. Thankfully, homeopathy will not conflict with any orthodox medicine and is absolutely safe to use both. I embrace the integrative medicine concept, where patients are able to get the best from both conventional and complementary treatments. People come to me for help a wide range of issues. Here are a few of the more common difficulties that can be supported through an integrative approach with homeopathy and natural supplements: I currently see patients via Skype. I'm happy to take advantage of the technology and nowadays more people prefer receiving a consultation from the comfort of their own home! The cost for the Natural Health treatment which comprises a homeopathic consultation, dietary and supplementation advice, is \u00a395 for 1,5 hours. \"I have been living with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome for 20 years. I have coped with managing symptoms for my flare ups with steroids but the symptoms were always there, and the last year were becoming more intense. I realized I needed a change in my lifestyle and I desperately wanted to improve my quality of life. I'm a mum of two young children and I had to be fit and well for them. Kiki has helped me to understand what was fueling my body's inflammation and gradually helped to intervene to my diet so I could feel more energized. The combination of the right supplements have really helped, so I have noticed that the flare ups of my illness were less and less frequent. Recently I also opted for a homeopathic approach which changed completely the way I face life and my illness. I felt empowered, and in charge of my life. I definitely recommend an holistic approach to whoever battles with self immune disease: it can absolutely improve quality of life!\" \u2014 Anna, Bath \"I started seeing Kiki when I decided that the skin complaint of my 7 years old son would not respond to traditional medicines such as steroid creams. He developed a rash at his face that seemed to appear every time he would get upset and it would last for few days. It started after we moved to another town and I felt that it might had something to do with his anxiety about his new school . Homeopathy has helped him enormously to settle down in our new environment and also helped with his outbursts of anger. The appearance of the rash became rare until it disappeared. Since then, I've seen her for the recurrent chest infections of my daughter and her suggestions have helped to boost her immune system so now she rarely catches a cold. I trust her advice as she always seems so knowledgeable about the best products the market and with great tips about children's health. The list goes on and on with the things she has helped my family. I am so grateful to have found her!\" \u2014 Heather, Bath \u00a9Natural "}
