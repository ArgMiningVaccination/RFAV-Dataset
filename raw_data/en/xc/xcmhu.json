This dichotomy however seems to have been overcome in recent times, as many eastern healing traditions have slowly and steadily percolated the health care system worldwide. This is especially true of mind-body therapies that focus on the health promotive intrinsic connections that exist between the human brain, mind, body, and individual behaviour. This includes techniques of meditation (mantra meditation, mindfulness meditation, and others), qi gong, tai chi, and yoga. This article appeared in the Annals of SBV 2014; 3 (1): 29-41. 2016 Lifestyle modification is a cornerstone of hypertension (HPT) treatment, yet most recommendations currently focus on diet and exercise and do not consider stress reduction strategies. Yoga is a spiritual path that may reduce blood pressure (BP) through reducing stress, increasing parasympathetic activation, and altering baro-receptor sensitivity; however, despite reviews on yoga and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and anxiety that suggest yoga may reduce BP, no comprehensive review has yet focused on yoga and HPT. A systematic review of all published studies on yoga and HPT was performed revealing 39 cohort studies, 30 nonrandom-ized, controlled trials (NRCTs), 48 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), and 3 case reports with durations ranging from 1 wk to 4 y and involving a total of 6693 subjects. Most studies reported that yoga effectively reduced BP in both normotensive and hypertensive populations. These studies suggest that yoga is an effective adjunct therapy for HPT and worthy of inclusion in clinical guidelines, yet the great heterogeneity of yoga practices and the variable quality of the research makes it difficult to recommend any specific yoga practice for HPT. Future research needs to focus on high quality clinical trials along with studies on the mechanisms of action of different yoga practices. (Altern Ther Health Med. 2014;20(2):32-59.) Souvenir of the International Day of Yoga 2015 Celebration at SBVU, Pondicherry.

Dissertation/thesis 2019 A THESIS OF COMPILATION OF RESEARCH PAPERS, ARTICLES & WORK DONE Submitted for Doctor of Science (Yoga) (Honoris Causa) By Yogacharya Dr. Ananda Balayogi Yogacharya Dr Ananda Balayogi Bhavanani, Director of the Centre for Yoga Therapy Education and Research (CYTER), and Professor of Yoga Therapy at the Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth, Pondicherry, was awarded the prestigious DSc (Yoga) award by the SVYASA Yoga University in Bangalore on the 12th January 2019. He received the DSc (Yoga) award from Dr. Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, and Michael Nobel co-founder and former Chairman of the Nobel Charitable Trust in presence of the Chancellor of SVYASA Yogashri Dr HR Nagendraji at the university campus during a glittering 16th convocation held on the birth anniversary of Swamy Vivekananda, the 12 January. Dr Ananda becomes only the second Pondicherrian to receive this coveted academic honur after his illustrious Yoga research guru, Prof Madanmohan who had received the award 8 years ago. Advances in mind-body medicine 2015 Yoga and breathing techniques have become increasingly popular in recent decades. Sudarshan Kriya (SK) is a type of rhythmic and controlled breathing that involves cyclic breathing in which long breaths are followed by medium and short breaths. Scientific research has been conducted to study the effects of SK on different physiological parameters. Various studies have shown that the technique is simple and cost effective and can be used as a complementary therapy, together with ongoing conventional treatments, to help people suffering from extreme levels of stress, anxiety, and other physical problems. Studies have demonstrated that SK can play an important role in promoting a healthy lifestyle by improving immunity, antioxidant status, hormonal status, and brain functioning. Through available scientific evidence and research, the current article aims to review the complementary role of rhythmic breathing (ie, SK) as a practical and effective tool to alleviate stress, improve health... Background and Objectives: Previous studies have suggested that yoga positively impacts lung function and quality of life (QoL). The present prospective two-arm, single-blinded and controlled study evaluated the effect of adjuvant yoga therapy on pulmonary function and QoL in patients of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Material and Methods: Seventy two COPD patients were recruited and randomized to yoga group who received adjuvant yoga therapy in addition to standard medical management and control group who received only medical management. Yoga therapy protocol included loosening exercises, postures, breathing techniques and relaxation. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1) and FEV1/FVC were measured using computerized pulmonary function test 'Trueflow (ndd)'. Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) was used to asses QoL. Changes in parameters were correlated with symptoms, activity, impacts and quality scores. Intra-group comparisons were done using Student's paired 't' test and intergroup comparisons using unpaired 't' test. Results: There was significant improvement (p < 0.001) in FVC and FEV1 after four weeks of adjuvant yoga therapy while controls showed decline in all parameters. QoL scores, namely: symptoms , activity , impacts and quality improved significantly in yoga group with no significant changes in controls. Significant correlation was found between pulmonary function and QoL in Yoga group. Conclusion: Significant improvements of lung function with adjuvant yoga therapy can be attributed to comprehensive yoga therapy package administered to participants resulting in decreased airway resistance and better lung compliance attributed to nonspecific broncho-protective / broncho-relaxing effect. Significant improvement in QoL scores can be attributed to improved vital capacity as well as enhanced self-confidence /self-reliance. We conclude that there is a positive and additive role of adjuvant therapy with standard medical management of COPD. Background: Alteration in biochemical profile has been observed in perimenopause due to change in the hormonal level. Regular practice of yoga has been found to be effective in improving serum lipid concentration, glycemic index and combat the oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of yoga on glycemic index, serum lipid profile, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), cortisol and antioxidant activity (AOA) in healthy perimenopausal women residing in the coastal region of Karnataka. Methodology: 111 women aged 40 to 60 years with perimenopausal symptoms were recruited considering inclusion and exclusion criteria set for the study. Our participants were checked for glycemic index, serum lipid profile, TSH, cortisol and AOA levels before and after 12-weeks of yoga intervention. Results: Yoga therapy intervention resulted in significant decrease (P=0.05) in fasting blood sugar, glycated hemoglobin (P=0.03), total cholesterol ratio concentration whereas high density lipoprotein (HDL), TSH and AOA was increased within the normal range after the intervention, though the change was not statistically significant. Cortisol showed no significant change after yoga therapy intervention. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that yoga helps in improving the glycemic index, serum lipid profile, TSH and AOA in perimenopausal women. Thus it can be effectively used to improve the quality of life in perimenopausal women. Keywords: Perimenopause, TSH, cortisol, AOA, yoga, Karnataka.
