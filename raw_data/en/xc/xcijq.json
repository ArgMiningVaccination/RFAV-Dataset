Background In May 2008 a letter from the OECD was sent to the Working Group of National Co-ordinators of the TG (WNT) and the Endocrine Disrupters Testing and Assessment Advisory Group (EDTA AG) requesting contributions for the development of a \"case study\" document that is expected to lead to a \"Report on Endocrine Disrupters Assessment in OECD Member Countries\". By this paper Denmark is submitting its contribution by providing an overview of different governmental programmes and a description of various initiatives listed according to the different levels in the conceptual framework, where possible. 2. Introduction During the last 15 years there has been a growing concern about endocrine disrupting substances in Denmark. In the beginning of the 90'es, it attracted a ttention that some industrial chemicals were able to mimic the effects of intrinsic oestrogenic compounds and in 1993 the Danish scientist, Niels Erik Skakkeb\u00e6k in cooperation with Richard Sharpe laun ched \"the oestrogen hypothesis\", arguing that the increasing incidence of reproductive abnormalities in the human male may be related to increased exposure to oestrogenic compounds in utero and this may be a result of exposure to industrial chemicals [1]. In the following years it was realised that some chemicals we re able to interfere with several intrinsic hormonal systems and affect the whole endocrine system and chemicals with these properties were referred to as endocrine disrupters. Endocrine disrupters have been on the political agenda in Denmark since the oestrogen hypothesis was launched. The constant political focus on the endocrine disrupters problem have led to several political initiatives, including research initiatives. 3. Governmental Programmes As a follow-up to intense public debate after the launch of the oestrogen hypothesis the Environmental Protection Agency (DK EPA) published a report in 1995 summarising the current knowledge on male reproductive disorders and environmental chemicals with oestrogenic effects [38]. In 1996, the DK EPA prepared a status on \"Chemical Substances with Estrogen-hormone-like Effects\" [14]. In 1997-2000 the Danish Council for Strategic Environmental Research supported 8 projects under the programme \"Hormone-mimicking Substances\". In 1996-2000, the Research Centre for Oestrogenic Substances was established under the Strategic Environmental Research Programme, a programme co-funded by 7 ministries in Denmark. Strategy for Human Health and the Environment (2003) In 2003 the Danish government published this strategy, which sets up aims and initiatives to prevent and limit negative environmental effects on human health. A cross-ministerial working group for health and environment was formed, and 10 focus areas were pointed out. One focus point was that the efforts towards endocrine disrupting substances should be strengthened [18] 1. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 18 The Danish National Strategy for the work with Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDC) A special grant on the state budget is dedicated the work on strengthening the scientific basis for managing the endocrine disrupter problem. In 2002 the first report on the Danish National Strategy for the work with EDCs was presented in Parliament, and status for the work has been reported in 2003, 2004 and 2007 [2]. Actions are prioritised in accordance with a 3-pronged strategy and the prioritised activities are very much in line with the EU strategy on Endocrine Disrupters from 1999. The 3 focus areas are: 1) Knowledge building and development of test methods 2) Investigations of cause and effect and preventive efforts 3) Regulation In order to use resources most efficiently the strategy is - as far as possible - to link and coordinate all activities and thereby obtaining synergy. The scientists involved in projects under this strategy are organised in an endocrine disrupters network which meet twice a year to report progress of the work to the Danish EPA. This informal discussion of resear ch progress between regulators, toxicologists, ecotoxicologists, endocrinologists, paediatricians and epidemiologists working with endocrine disruption in different organisms (fish, rats, mice and humans) has turned to be very fruitful both from a scientific and a regulatory point of view. Not only new evidence on likely causes and effects of exposure to individual EDCs both in wildlife and humans is being discussed at these meetings but considerable discussion also take place regarding issues like testguideline deve lopment within the OECD TGP & EDTA, effects of combined exposure to EDCs, exposure analysis concerning EDCs etc 1. Strategic Research 2003-2005 The Danish government started a strengthened research initiative in the area of endocrine disrupters in 2003. This initiative supported a number of research projects in 2003-2005, which were administered by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. The themes for the research projects were: Breast cancer, diseases in the male reproductive organs and reduced semen quality, diverging pubertal patterns, influences of chemicals, deformities of sexual organs in newborns and the effects of endocrine disrupters in the environment and in humans 1. Pesticides Research Programme With the aim to ensure a solid scientific basis for the administration of pesticides, a governmental programme for pesticides research has been running for the last 2 decades. Several projects related to endocrine disrupting effects of pesticides have been carried out through the years 2. Nordic co-operation, Nord-Utte In 1994 the Nordic Group for the Development for Test Methods (Nord-Utte) was established under the Nordic Chemicals Group under the auspices of the No rdic Council of Ministers. Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish and Danish representatives from the environmental protection agencies participate in the work. Nord-Utte aims at integrating the scientific and re gulatory work on testing of chemicals in the Nordic countries. Beyond contributions to the OECD test guideline programme Nord-Utte organises network meetings and support projects involved in the developmen t of test methods. One of the main priorities of the group has been the development of test methods for detection of endocrine disrupting substances [17] 1. EU Co-operation ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 19 One of the short-term activities in the European Strategy on Endocrine Disrupters is establishment of a priority list of substances for further evaluation of their role in endocrine disruption. DK EPA has prepared a proposal for ensuring a dynamic process for the EU priority list of substances with potential endocrine disrupting effects covering inclusion and exclusion of substances when new data are available. The proposal was presented at a Commission stakeholder meeting in October 2003. Centre for Endocrine Disrupters A Danish Centre for Endocrine Disrupters is established as a result of the negociations of the state budget for 2008. After an EU tender inviting for the management of the centre and co-ordination of research projects the Centre opened 1 December 2008. The Centre is formed as a network of scientists and relevant institutions working with knowledge building focusing on authorities preventive work and with a formal centre management placed at the Department of Grow th and Reproduction at the Copenhagen University Hospital. 4. Danish initiatives in relation to the OECD conceptual framework for testing and assessment of endocrine disrupting substances Criteria for assessment of endocrine disrupters have not yet been established within the chemicals regulation due to the lack of proper test methods. Therefore, one of the focus areas in the national strategy is development of test methods. Until test methods have been developed endocrine disrupters are identified case-by-case and in this work decisions based on preliminary indications are necessary. The above mentioned strategies and activities have resulted in a number of initiatives and projects related to the identification of endocrine disrupters and preventive measures. Until now these activities have mainly concentrated on knowledge building, however, as more and more evidence for harmful effects is obtained the work is turning towards regulatory initiatives. In the following these activities will be described in line with the national strategy and when possible presented according to the 5 levels in the OECD conceptual framework. From a general perspective it is important to stress that the OECD conceptual framework for testing and assessment of endocrine disrupters may be used differently with regard to testing for toxicological effects than for testing for ecotoxicological effects. In prin ciple, toxicological and ecotoxicological test methods are designed with particular reference to different protection purposes, as the use of ecotoxicological tests is aimed at protection on an ecosystem level (i.e. pr otection of a fish population) whereas toxicological tests are aimed at protection of a single species (man). Level 1 - Sorting and prioritisation based upon existing information Knowledge building and development of test methods: Inter-ministerial network In 2007 an inter-ministerial endocrine disrupter's network was established in order to co-ordinate the work on endocrine disrupters among relevant ministries. The Ministry of the Environment is responsible for the national strategy on endocrine disrupters and therefore, one important task for the network is to ensure that knowledge and new data is transferred and shared among authorities so relevant precautionary measures can be taken and furthermore, to set up an alert system between ministries in case immediate action is necessary. The network consists of representatives from the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, the Ministry of Health and Prevention, the Ministry of Employment and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation 1. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 20 Workshops A number of workshops with focus on endocrine disrupters and their effects have been arranged during the years that are funded or co-funded by the Ministries of the Environment and Health and Prevention. An international three day workshop about testicular cancer was held in August 2002. The ministries have also funded several three-days international conferences named \"Copenhagen Workshops on Endocrine disrupters, the 2nd: A possible role of mixed exposures for reproductive failures and malignancies\" in December 2002, the 3rd: on Environment, Reproductive Health and Fertility in January 2004, the 4th: Endocrine disrupters and consumer products: possibl e effects on human populations in May 2007 and the 5th : Ubiquitous endocrine disrupters and possible human health effects will take place in May 2009. Finally, a one-day national workshop: \"EDC's - how far are we?\" was arranged in December 2006 and a national workshop: \"Focus on recent Research in Endocrine Disruption\" was arranged in May 2008 and in addition a half-day workshop took place in December 2008 focusing on new Danish data on endocrine disrupters 1. Analyses of Substance Flows of Resorcinol and 4-nitrotoluene After publication of the 1 st step of the work with establishment of an EU priority list of substances for further evaluation of their role in endocrine disruption, substance flow analyses were conducted for two substances on the list, namely resorcinol and 4-nitrotoluene, in order to investigate if there is a risk related to consumer exposure. The analyses included an investigation of possible alternatives and a screening of effects on environment and health. No exposure of consumers or the environment were detected for 4- nitrotoluene. For resorcinol the use in hair colours was found to be potentially problematic and the report was forwarded to the European Commission as input to future evaluations of the use of the substance in hair colours [4, 5] 3. Survey of the use of 22 active ingredients in pesticides with endocrine disrupting properties in other products than pesticides As another follow-up to the publication of the 1 st step of the work with establishment of an EU priority list for potentially EDCs, it was investigated whether 22 active ingredients used as pesticides and listed on the priority list were used in other chemical products than pesticides. There was no widespread use of these substances in other chemical products than pesticides in Denmark. Other uses were already regulated or the ingredients were used in very small quantities [13] 2. Investigations of causes and effects and preventive efforts: Investigation of endocrine di sruption in freshwater fish Endocrine disruption was observed in freshwater fish in Danish water courses in 2001 [3]. These findings resulted in the establishment of a series of projects aimed at investigating the cause and extent of these findings [10, 11, 12, 24, 25]. Based on these studies, it was concluded that the observed endocrine disruption in freshwater fish most probably was caused by exposure to natural oestrogens and not synthetic oestrogens or oestrogenic substances. Further, it was concluded that the majority of Danish wastewater is treated sufficiently to reduce the amount of oestroge ns released the environment to a level which is considered of low significance. The projects have been followed up by more research-oriented activities aimed at studying the importance of oestrogens released to the environment when manure is us as fertiliser on farmland 1. Surveillance of the semen quality in young Danish men ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 21 Surveillance of the semen quality of young healthy Danish men was initiated in 1996, and since 2001 the project has been supported by the Danish EPA and the Ministry of Health. The investigations have shown that young Danish men living in Copenhagen have a relatively low semen quality, also when compared to similar countries as e.g. Finland. The research activity has also focused on the reason for the geographical differences 1. Surveys of chemicals in consumer products Since 2001 the Danish EPA has surveyed the exposure of consumers to chemicals from consumer products. The surveys have mainly included chemicals in toys, cosmetics, jewellery, furniture, household chemicals and hobby products, whereas pharmaceuticals, medical devices, foods and products which are in contact with food have not been included. The main focus has been on chemicals which could be sensitising, carcinogenic, persistent, bioaccumulative or toxic, but substances with endocrine disruptive effects have also been surveyed. Examples of surveys of exposure to endocrine disrupters are: \"phthalates in products consumer products\" and \"use of PVC and phthalates in Denmark in 2000 and 2001\". Furthermore, an investigation of 2-year old infants' exposure to chemicals is ongoing, and the result will be published in 2009. This project focuses especially on exposure to endocrine disrupters and sensitising substances 3. Regulation : Input to the EU priority list of substances for further evaluation The Danish EPA has requested the EU Commission to include parabens on the EU priority list on substances for further evaluation in their role of endocrine disruption, and has continuously pointed out the importance of updating the list. (Regulation of several classes of chemicals) Input to REACH In the REACH-process Denmark worked for inclusion of endocrine disrupters in the REACH regulation in the best possible way. One of the inputs to the REACH process was the Nordic discussion paper on if and how the OECD conceptual framework can be used fo r regulation of endocrine disrupting substances, which is described below under level 3. In the final REACH text, endocrine disrupters are covered by the authorization procedure by a case-by-case assessment. This means that if it can be justified that a substance may have endocrine disrupting properties leading to adverse effects, the substance can be banned generally, however, approval for certain uses can be granted if safe use can be documented. (Regulation of several classes of chemicals) National list of Undesired Substances In 1998 the Danish EPA published an advisory list of undesirable substances, that gave priority to 26 substances for which the authorities indicated interest in restricting use or completely banning in future. The list serves as guidance to companies that wish to engage proactively in voluntary phasing out undesired substances. The list has been updated three times, most recently in 2004. In 2004 those category 1 substances on the EU priority list of substances for further evaluation that were not already subjects to regulation or covered by an authorisation system for plant-protection products [6] were included in the list of undesired substances. In 2008 it was announced that all category 1 substances on the EU priority list will be included in the revised list of undesirable substances which is expected in 2009. (Regulation of several classes of chemicals) International regulation of endocrine disrupting compounds ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 22 A number of endocrine disrupting compounds have been subjects for international regulation - regionally as well as globally. Examples are regulation of certain brominated flame retardants (EU), organic tin compounds (EU, International Maritime Organization), nonylphenol and nonylphenolethoxylates (EU) and persistent organics pollutants like PCBs, DDT, dioxin and furans (EU and the Stockholm Convention). It is not possible to attribute information from certain le vels of the OECD conceptual framework for these substances as documentation for these regulations. Furthermore, these regulations have also referred to other inherent hazardous properties of the chemicals than endocrine disruptive properties. (Regulation of several classes of chemicals) Guidance to consumers Food for thought - facts about endocrine disrupting substances In 2002 the booklet \"Stof til eftertanke - fakta om hormonforstyrrende stoffer\" (in English: \"Food for thought - facts about endocrine disrupting substances \", only available in Danish) was published in a co- operation between the Danish Food Directorate, the Da nish EPA and the National Board of Health. The booklet informs about endocrine disrupters, which effects they might cause and how and where one can be exposed to them. It aims at all Danish consumers, but has a special focus on pregnant and parents with small children [7]. (Guidance mainly related to industrial existing chemicals) Good chemistry to pregnant and nursing mothers - 9 good habits In September 2006 the Ministry of the Environment launched the campaign \"Good chemistry to pregnant and nursing mothers - 9 good habits\". The campaign pointed out 9 easy ways to reduce the exposure of the mother and the baby to chemicals, including endocrine disrupters, in cosmetics, toys and baby products. It was a network campaign with a network of midwifes, doctors and nurses, who distributed the material and used it for dialogue with the pregnant and nursing mothers and new parents. The campaign was very successful. An evaluation showed that 2/3 of the respondents in the target group were aware of the campaign, 2/3 of these had obtained new knowledge. Fifty percent of the respondents who were aware about the campaign followed the advise beforehand, while 30-35% had changed their behaviour as a result of the campaign [8, 9]. (Guidance mainly related to industrial existing chemicals) Voluntary agreements - Voluntary agreement since 1987 between the Danish EPA and the trade organization SPT (soap, perfume and technical-chemical articles) about substitution of nonylphenol-ethoxylates in washing- and cleaning agents. (Voluntary programme for industrial existing chemicals) - Voluntary agreement from 1995 between the Dani sh EPA and the \"Dansk Plantev\u00e6rn\" (Danish Association of manufacturers and importers of pesticides) about removal of oestrogen-like additives in pesticide formulations. (Voluntary programme for pesticides) Level 2: In vitro assays providing data about endocrine mechanisms Knowledge building and development of test methods: Development of computer models ((Q)SARs) for endocrine disrupting effects The (Q)SAR-group at the National Food Institute have developed three computer models ((Q)SARs) for endocrine disrupting effects in in vitro assays. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 23 1) Oestrogen -receptor binding (in vitro). The training set uses data from METI (Japan). Data on 595 chemicals constitute the training set - the domain of the model within about 47,000 EINECS substances was 52%. Cross-validation results for the ((Q)SAR) m odel showed sensitivity, specificity and concordance to be 77 %, 87 % and 83 %, respectively. In the experimental method, human oestrogen receptor produced from Escherichia coli was used. The chemical substance is added to a system where RI-labelled oestrogen as reference hormone binds to the human oestrogen receptor. The chemical concentration that inhibits 50% of the binding of the reference hormone to the receptor is measured and defined as IC 50. As endpoint units, RBA (Relative Binding Affinity) between the IC 50 values of the chemical and a natural hormone (E2, etc.) when the IC 50 concentration of natural hormone is set at 100 was used [41-43, 45]. 2) Oestrogen reporter gene (in vitro). The training set was derived from METI (Japan). Data on 481 chemicals constitute the training set - the domain of the model within about 47,000 EINECS substances was 61%. Cross-validation results for the (Q)SAR- mode l showed sensitivity, specificity and concordance to be 46 %, 95 % and 81 %, respectively In the experimental method, the oestrogenic effect of chemicals was measured as an increase of the luminescence response induced by the synthetic oestrogen E2 in harvested MCF-7 cells. As endpoint units the increase in luminescence response was used as active/not active intersection point. The test identifies chemicals, which have influence on oestrogen receptor binding and transactivation of the receptor followed by oestrogen-dependent gene expression [41-43, 45]. 3) Androgen receptor antagonism (in vitro). The traini ng set contains data from own experimental testing and data from the literature. Data on 523 chemicals constitute the training set - the domain of the model within about 47,000 EINECS substances was 56%. Cross-validation results for the ((Q)SAR) model showed sensitivity, specificity and concordance to be 64 %, 84 % and 76 %, respectively. In the experimental method, the androgen receptor antagonism of chemicals was measured as the inhibition of the luminescence response induced by the synthetic androgen R1881 in harvested Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. As endpoint units, inhibition of luminescence response as active/not active intersection point was used. The activity is observed as an inhibition of the progress of androgen receptor binding and transactivation of the receptor followed by gene expression visualized by enzyme response [43-45] 1. Participation in OECD validation of an in vitro steroid synthesis assay (H295R ) Some compounds can modulate steroid hormone production or breakdown and cause endocrine disruption without acting as direct hormone mimics. The H295R cel l line is a human female adrenocortical carcinoma that produces many steroid hormones including progestins, androgens & oestrogens, glucocorticoids & mineral corticoids and steroidogenic enzymes (CYP11A, CYP11B, CYP17, CYP19, CYP21). The National Food Institute has participated in the two rounds of the pre- validation and the validation of this assay aimed to detect substances that influence the steroid synthesis. The results showed that absolute hormone levels may differ, but relative dose-response profiles are comparable for all model compounds tested across laboratories, that the assay can discern between strong, medium and weak inducers and inhibitors of T and E2 production as well as negative responses and that the H295R Steroidogenesis Assay is a rapid, economic and cost effective screen of chemicals for their potential to alter steroidogenesis. Thus, the work with this assay has taken important steps forward towards the development and adoption of a test guideline for the method in the OECD Test Guideline Programme. This project was supported by the Danish EPA and the Nordic co-operation Nord-Utte [17] 1. Development of in vitro assay to screen for effects on the thyroid receptor (T-screen assay) The T-screen assay has been established at the National Food Institute and many chemicals have been tested for effects on the proliferation of murine GH3 cells. The current experience shows difficulties by identification of positive chemicals in this assay and the future regulatory use of this assay seems to be limited1. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 24 Development of androgen receptor reporter gene assay (AR-assay) The androgen receptor reporter gene assay has been established at the National Food Institute and used with much success in order to detect anti-androgenic activity. Many of the potential anti-androgens found in this in vitro assay were subsequently shown to be anti-androgens in vivo1. Development of method to include metabolism in in vitro assays The National Food Institute has begun research and development concerning the metabolic capacity of commonly used in vitro assays as well as how to incorporate external metabolism in cellular assays1. Regulation : The OECD Conceptual Framework fo r Testing and Assessment of Endocrine Disrupters as a basis for regulation of substances with endocrine disrupting propertie s Denmark initiated and led this Nordic (Nord-Utte) project, investigating if and how the OECD conceptual framework can be used for regulation of endocrine disrupting substances. A number of proposals of how to use test results from the different levels of the conc eptual framework were put forward together with a number of proposals of how to enhance the existing test guidelines in order to assess endocrine disrupting effects [15]. The results were presented at EDTA8 in January 2005. Specific proposals for the use of the test results from level 2-5 in the conceptual framework as regulatory instruments in the EU can be found in the report, however, the conclusions for the regulatory use of test results from each level will be presented for each level below. The conclusion for the use of level 2 tests for regulatory purposes was that: \"positive in vitro test results indicate potential ED activity and a potential for ED effects in vivo. In vitro data can provide valuable mechanistic data that is useful for the design of further in vivo studies. The in vitro tests are relevant for effects in humans because many of these tests are based on human hormone receptors. Chemicals that bind to these receptors are therefore likely to cause effects in in vivo studies and on reproductive function in humans. Negative in vitro test results cannot be used to exclude potential EDC activity because of limitations such as inability or unknown capacity to metabolically activate toxicants and because EDC activity can occur through mechanism other than those tested in the in vitro test system. (Q)SAR models for ED activity and reproductive toxicity effects are under development but at present the use for priority setting and risk assessment is undecided\". (Regulation of several classes of chemicals) Level 3 - In vivo assays providing data ab out single endocrine mechanisms and effects Knowledge building and development of test methods: - Participation in the development of the Uterotrophic assay The Uterotrophic assay is an in vivo test method for detection of chemicals that have the potential to act like and interfere with the endogenous female sex hormone. The National Food Institute participated in the initial work towards validation of the uterotrophic assay in 1999-01 (phase one), the validation using weak oestrogens and a negative control in 2000-2 (phase two) and the OECD discussion on the progress of the work and the draft OECD test guideline in 2003-7. This work was supported by the Danish EPA 1. Participation in the development of the Hershberger assay ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 25 In 2000-2001, the National Food Institute participated in all three phases of the validation of the Hershberger assay, where two potent chemicals were te sted, i.e. AR-agonist testosterone propionate and the AR-antagonist Flutamide. In 2002-3, the Institute participated in phase two, where several weak agonists and antagonists were tested. In 2004-5, the Institute participated in phase thee of the OECD validation, where the purposes were to investigate the reproducibility of results by comparisons to the results in phase one and 2, the specificity by testing of negative compounds and compare data from Hershberger assay using adult castrated rats and immature male rats. During 2000-8, experts from the Institute also participated in the OECD discussion on the progress of the work and the various versions of the ring test reports and draft OECD test guidel ine. This work was supported by the Danish EPA 1. Assays to detect chemicals with effects on the thyroid To test whether a chemical disrupts the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis (HPT-axis), a limited number of screening assays are available. EDSTAC recomme nds the frog metamorphosis assay, the adult male assay (to detect anti-androgenic effects, full thyroid and reproductive hormone screen) and the Japanese quail has been proposed as an in vivo model for action on TH-binding proteins (Ishihara et al., 2003). None of these tests have yet been validated for guideline purposes, and there is only one vertebrate-based assay currently being evaluated namely the \"frog metamorphosis assay\" (Gray et al., 2002, EPA), but this assay in the OECD TGP do not address human health. The National Food Institute has worked with development of an in vivo thyroid assay in pregnant rats since 2004. The main endpoints are thyroxine (T4) levels in dams during pregnancy and lactation, T4 in pups on postnatal day 13 and growth and development of the pups before weaning. The main purpose with the work is to study if NOAELs from this model gives sufficient protection in relation to developmental neurotoxicity effects later in life (see further details under level 5). This work is supported by the Danish EPA 1. Participation in the Fish Screening Assay ring test In 2003 and 2004 Danish laboratories participated in the ring test of the Fish Screening Assay (FSA). The FSA utilizes adult fish (preferably zebra fish, thead minnow and Japanese medaka). The induction of vitellogenin is the major endpoint in the test. Thus, the test is mainly sensitive towards endocrine disrupting chemicals with an oestrogenic mode of ac tion. University of Southern Denmark (SDU) and DHI have contributed with research on the development of methods for immunochemical determination of vitellogenin concentrations in plasma of various fish species and whole body of zebra fish and dose- response relationships for various chemicals (i.e. parabens, alkylphenols, bisphenols A, chemical UV- filters, natural and synthetic oestrogens). Furthermore, different exposure routes (water, food, injection) in different fish species have been investigated and the results have been published. Both SDU and DHI have been actively involved during the experimental validation phase of the test proposal. This project was supported by the Danish EPA and the Nordic co-operation Nord-Utte [17] 1. Investigations of causes and effects and preventive efforts: The National Food Institute has investigated 5 currently used pesticides (prochloraz, simazine, deltamethrin, tribenuronmethyl, methiocarb) as single chemicals and mixture in the Hershberger Assay [46, 77, 81]. The results showed anti-androgenic effects and the mixture effects appeared additive. This work was supported by the Danish EPA. The test results for prochloraz have been used as part of the documentation for banning the use of prochloraz. (Governmental programme for pesticides and to be used for several classes of chemicals) Regulation: ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 26 - Nordic project on the possible use of the OECD Conceptual Framework as a basis for regulation of substances with endocrine disrupting properties, see level 2. The conclusion for the use of level 3 tests for regulatory purposes was: \"that the assays at level 3 provide an in vivo screening of potential endocrine disrupting activity of a substance. Except for the frog metamorphosis assay, the assays at level 3 provide information about the potency of the compound in vivo . Furthermore, the outcome of the assays indicates potential for adverse effects in the reproductive developmental studies at level 5. At present, it is uncertain to what extent the frog metamorphosis assay can be used for screening in relation to effects on humans\". Level 4 - In vivo assays providing data about multiple endocrine mechanisms and effects Knowledge building and development of test methods: Active commenting of the work for updating the 28-days study with regards to EDC properties (enhanced/updated TG407) The National Food Institute has participated in the OECD discussions on the validation results in relation to the revision of the 28-days repeated dose toxicity study (OECD TG 407) since 2005. The intention was to enhance the sensitivity of this assay for detection of endocrine disrupting chemicals. The validation results showed that the revised assay detected only potent EDCs, whereas weak EDCs, i.e. those causing effect only during development, were not detected. In addition, only one chemical with potent effects on thyroid hormones were included in the validation. Consequently, the National Food Institute found that the sensitivity of the enhanced/updated assay was problematic and hesitated to recommend further development into a guideline. As the updated assay, however, seems to detect potent anti-androgens and oestrogens further development was accepted if the first paragraphs in the revised guideline clearly states that a negative result in this assay cannot exclude endocrine effects. During 2007-8, the National Food Institute has commented on the OECD Guidance Document on histopathological effects. This work was supported by the Danish EPA 1. Enhancement of the prenatal developmental toxicity study (OECD TG 414) in order to detect effects on foetal steroidogenesis and anogenital distance The purpose of the project performed at the National Food Institute was to investigate whether implementation of assessment of testosterone levels and anogenital distance (AGD) in male foetuses would be useful for investigating endocrine disruptive e ffects in the OECD Test Guideline 414: \"Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study\". In 2004-2006 samples from male foetuses exposed to fourteen different substances were analysed [47-50, 54-55]. The results showed that it is feasible to include assessment of testosterone synthesis and anogenital distance (AGD) in the male foetuses in a TG 414 study design. This project was supported by the Danish EPA and the Nordic co-operation Nord-Utte [17] 1. Lead for development and validation of the Fish Sexual Development Test (FSDT) The FSDT utilizes the fact that the sexual development in fish is very sensitive to exposure to chemicals that interfere with the effect of the normal se x hormones. This makes the FSDT very sensitive to oestrogenic, androgenic, anti-oestrogenic, anti-andr ogenic and aromatase-inhi biting chemicals. The FSDT (earlier named the Fish Partial Life-Cycle Test) is a modified version of the OECD guideline 210 adopted in 1992 - the Fish Early-Life Stage Toxicity Test with added end-points for the detection of endocrine disrupters (secondary sex characteristics, vitellogen in (VTG) concentration and sex ratio) (OECD, 2005). The main idea behind this assay is that exposure to endocrine disrupters during the sensitive window during sexual development of the fish will alter the VTG concentration and sexual development based on the property of the hormone they are exposed to. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 27 The FSDT - with Denmark as lead country - was include d in the work plan of the OECD test guideline program in 2003. During autumn 2005 and early spring 2006 in-depth statistical evaluation of potential test designs was performed. The outcome was presented at the EDTA9 in 2006. The OECD fish drafting group agreed then on the statistical design and to carry through experimental validation of the test method. First round of the validation took place until summer 2007 and has successfully been completed. Phase 2 of the validation exercise is taking place during 2008. This project has been supported by the Danish EPA and the Nordic co-operation Nord-Utte [17] 1. Participation in the development of the Copepod Development and Reproduction Test At the moment there are no internationally harmonized (i.e. OECD) test methods for chronic effects on marine invertebrates even though they are an ecologically important and large group of organisms. These invertebrates serve as food for fish larvae and they need to be protected to secure transfer of energy from the primary producers to higher levels in the ecosystems. Therefore, the development of a test for reproduction and development of marine copepods was started in 2005, and has been included in the work plan of the OECD Test Guideline Programme. A couple of Danish labs have been involved in pre- validation work. This work was supported by the Danish EPA and the Nordic co-operation Nord-Utte [17]. Lead for development of an OECD TG on reproduction of springtails Springtails are important in soil, especially in temperate soils, where they are thought to be the most important group of arthropods. An ISO test guideline already exists for one of the springtail species, Folsomia candida . This test is already in use for pesticide evaluation within e.g. Europe and USA, and in certain cases for evaluating the potential problems related to application of sewage-sludge containing industrial chemicals on agricultural land. The springtail test includes an option between two test species: One asexually reproducing species and one sexually reproducing species. It also covers the reproductive capacity of the animals, will enable a detection of damage to the reproductive system which may be caused by compounds that modulate the arthropod sex hormone system. A draft OECD Springtail test guideline was pre-validated in 2004, and accepted for the work plan of the OECD TGP at the WNT-meeting in 2005. A draft TG proposal (with a ring test report annexe d) is shortly being circulated to OECD NCs for comments. This project has been supported by the Danish EPA and the Nordic co-operation Nord-Utte [17, 20] 1. Investigations of causes and effects and preventive efforts: Investigation of endocrine disruptive effects of nitrate and nitrite in vitro and of nitrate in vivo (after exposure in utero) The National Food Institute has studied in vitro effects of nitrite and nitrate in the steroid synthesis assay (H295R) and effects on anogenital distance and testos terone production in male rat foetuses from dams exposed to nitrate via drinking water (not published yet). This project has been supported by the Danish EPA 3. Regulation: Nordic project on the possible use of the OECD Conceptual Framework as a basis for regulation of substances with endocrine disrupting properties, see level 2. The conclusion for the use of level 4 tests for regulatory purposes was that: \"the assays at level 4 provide a thorough assessment of the potential endocrine disrupting effects of a substance in pubertal and young adults. Furthermore, level 4 provides information about the potency of a compound to be investigated at level 5. Effects on various endpoints included in the assays can either be considered as adverse or represent an effect on a mechanism relevant ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 28 for human e.g. changes in hormone levels. Therefore, these assays can be used to provide NO(A)ELs/LO(A)ELs to be used in human risk assessment until further studies are available. The intact male assay and the TG 407 may be more capable for detecting aromatase inhibitors and compounds affecting the steroid synthesis compared to the pubertal male assay. On the other hand, the two assays in intact young males may be less sensitive compared to the Uterotrophic and the Hershberger assay as well as the male and female pubertal assay\". Level 5 - In vivo assays providing adverse e ffects data from endocrine and other mechanisms Knowledge building and development of test methods: Enhancement of existing OECD guidelines for reproductive toxicity testing The National Food Institute has during many years studi ed a number of EDCs and their effects with the purpose of providing proposals for enhancing generation studies with respect to detection of endocrine disrupting effects. Input for this has been give n at OECDs EDTA meetings and in the OECD VMG Mammalian 1. Participation in the work for extending the 1-generation study The National Food Institute participates in the work on enhancing generation studies with respect to detection of endocrine disrupting effects, incl. the o ngoing development of the draft OECD test guideline for the Extended One-Generation study. There are indications that female mammary gland development is a sensitive endpoint for effects of EDCs and consequently, it has been proposed to include a placeholder for assessment of this effect in the draft OECD test guideline for the Extended One-Generation study 1. Effects on thyroid hormones during development and behavioural effects The National Food Institute studies the relationship between effects on thyroid hormones (thyroxine, T4) during pregnancy and lactation and behavioural effects in the offspring. In 2005-2006, propyl thiouracil was studied and the results showed that the effects on T4 during pregnancy and lactation were good and sufficiently sensitive predictors for effects on motor activity and learning effects in adult offspring [54]. In 2007-2008 mancozeb was studied. Mancozeb caused unexpected marked acute neurotoxicity in the dams at the doses used and consequently, the knowledge on the relationship between effects on thyroid hormones and behaviour in the offspring could not be expanded based on this study. In 2008, a study on the UV-filter octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) was started. OMC caused marked effects on thyroid hormones in both dams and offspring and decreased testes and prostate weight as well testosterone levels in the male offspring [52-53]. The behavioural testing is ongoi ng. This project is supported by the Danish EPA 1. Participation in the development of the OECD Te st Guideline 426 - Developmental Neurotoxicity Study A research group has since around 1993 (at the Institute for Occupational Health and since 1999 at the National Food Institute) developed methods for developmental neurotoxicity testing and participated in the development of the OECD Test Guideline 426 - De velopmental Neurotoxicity Study [60-74]. This guideline is relevant for EDCs, because hormones organize the sexual dimorphic development of the brain (sex hormones) and the general development of the brain (thyroid hormones). This project was supported by the Danish EPA, the Nordic co-operation Nord-Utte and others1. Participation in the development of the Fish Full Life Cycle Test In 1999 and 2000 the potential usefulness of zebra fish as test species in the 2-generation test in fish for detection of endocrine disrupting properties was investigated. The results supported the development of an ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 29 OECD DRP (lead by US) concerning a full life cycle te st on fish. This project was supported by the Danish EPA and the Nordic co-operation Nord-Utte [17, 19] 1. Investigations of causes and effects and preventive efforts: Mixture effects of similarly and dissimilarly acting EDCs Researchers at the National Food Institute have participated in the EU Strategic Research Framework programme project EDEN. During 2003-7, the Institute has investigated the effects of nine anti-androgens on sexual development and behaviour both as single chemicals and in combinations. Two mixture studies of respectively similarly and dissimilarly acting anti-a ndrogens has been performed [56-59]. The aim of the work was to investigate if mixture effects occur at NOAELS for the single chemicals and to assess whether such effects can be predicted based on dose-response studies for the single chemicals using dose-additivity modelling. From 2008, the National Food Institute participates in a new EU project CONTAMED where the aim is to study mixture effects after developmental exposure to 10-12 environmentally relevant EDCs at low doses. This project was supported by the Danish EPA and the EU 1. Effects of endocrine disrupting pesticides, phthalates and others The National Food Institute has investigated the effects of several endocrine disrupting pesticides, phthalates and others chemicals (e.g nonylphenol, di(2-ethylhexyl) adipate) on sexual differentiation of the reproductive system and the brain [56-59, 75-83]. Regulation: - Nordic project on the possible use of the OECD Conceptual Framework as a basis for regulation of substances with endocrine disrupting properties, see level 2. The conclusion for the use of level 5 tests for regulatory purposes was that: \"The reproductive toxicity studies provide adverse effect data and are especially useful for risk assessment as they indicate potential for effects in humans. The effects observed in reproductive toxicity studies may be due to other mechanism that endocrine effects, but the pattern of effects, e.g. decreased anogenital distance and malformations of reproductive organs in males, may indicate that endocrine effects are involved. Among the OECD test Guidelines for reproductive toxicity, exposure during all vulnerable periods of development is only performed in the two-generation study design. Late effects becoming manifest after weaning of the animals are partly covered in young adults, especially in relation to reproductive function and developmental neurotoxicity, but potentially important late effects are not assessed. Effects becoming manifest during ageing are not included in any guidelines for reproductive toxicity. A number of enhancements of the OECD Test Guidelines for reproductive toxicity for the detection of effects of EDCs seem re levant and lack of effects in reproductive toxicity studies can therefore at present not fully exclude the possibility for ED effects caused by chemicals tested negative\". ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 30 Attachment Cases The following cases illustrate that the regulatory initiatives towards endocrine disrupting compounds in many cases are influenced by exposure and not only effect or activity considerations. The cases also illustrate that assessments of the substances usually are based on weight of evidence, including information obtained by using non-test and test methods from several levels in the conceptual framework. One important outcome of all of the following cases has been contributions to the development of new or enhancement of relevant existing OECD test guidelines. Case 1: Azol fungicides The National Food Institute has investigated the effects of several commonly used azole fungicides (prochloraz, tebuconazole, propiconazole, assay and pre-and postnatal developmental toxicity studies 77, 83]. The studies showed that epoxiconazole, propiconazole, and tebuconazole, possess similar properties as the imidazole fungicide prochloraz regarding interactions with the ER, AR , and AhR, as well as effects on steroid hormone synthesis and the activity of the enzyme aromatase that converts testosterone to oestrogen. The three triazoles (tebuconazole, propiconazole, and epoxiconazole) turned out to be less potent than prochloraz in some of the assays. In order to investigate the effects on steroid synthesis, the H295R assay was established - a spinoff of this work was the participation in the validation of the assay for development in the OECD TGP. Furthermore, a bioassay (T-screen) for detecting binding and activation of the thyroid receptor (TR) was established and used to investigate the ability of prochloraz, epoxiconazole, propiconazole, and tebuconazole to be thyroid hormone agonists or antagonists. Convincing interactions with the TR were not found for either prochloraz or any of the triazole fungicides. Anti-androgenic effects of prochloraz, propiconazole and tebuconazole in vivo in young adult rats were studied using the Hershberger assay. None of the triazole fungicides, propiconazole or tebuconazole, had any androgen receptor blocking effect in vivo in the Hershberger assay at doses at or below 150 mg/kg bw/day. This is in contrast to prochloraz that induced anti-androgenic effects in this assay at doses between 50 and 150 mg/kg bw/day. Developmental effects of prochloraz, epoxiconazole and tebuconazole were investigated in rat offspring after exposure during pregnancy and lactation. Both prochloraz, epoxiconazole and tebuconazole caused an increased gestational length. This effect is probably related to the observed marked increases in plasma concentrations of progesterone in the mothers induced by these fungicides. Tebuconazole and epoxiconazole induced a high frequency of post-implantation loss, and epoxiconazole caused a marked increase in late and very late resorptions. Prochloraz and tebuconazole decreased the testosterone level in testis from the male fetuses and increased the number of nipples in the male pups, i.e anti-androgenic effects. Overall the results indicate that azole fungicides in ge neral have a similar profile of action in vitro but that the profile of action in vivo may differ. The common features for the tested azole fungicides are that they all increased gestational length and increased progesterone levels in the dams. Prochloraz and tebuconazol caused anti-androgenic effects in male offspring. The effects on steroid hormone synthesis in vitro, the lack of effect in the Hershberger assay (where effects on steroid synthesis is omitted by using testosterone supplemented castrated male rats) co mbined with the effects on reproductive developmental after perinatal exposure strongly indicate that one of the main responsible mechanisms may be disturbance of key- enzymes involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 31 The use of azoles within greenhouse production of or namental plants where the workers are highly exposed to this group of chemicals have been investigated during the last years. An epidemiological study showed elevated foreign oestrogen activity in the blood from female greenhouse workers compared to non- exposed women [39]. Also, preliminary results have shown increased incidences of impaired reproductive development in sons of female greenhouse workers from the island Funen [40]. The study was performed some years ago, and many of the investigated pesticides are not commercially available any longer. However, as azole fungicides are still approved for use in green houses these observations are concerning in the light of the endocrine disruptive properties of azole fungicides that have been shown in animal studies. As a consequence the DK EPA has now initiated several activities - first of all new risk assessments for the azole fungicides approved for green house use has been carried out, including new methods for exposure calculation at re-entry and appli cation of an extra safety factor. The DK EPA is also supporting a follow-up study that will include the same children now at their age of 7-10 years. Based on existing information and the outcome of the research mentioned above, stricter guidelines for handling azole fungicides in greenhouses have been established. (Governmental Programme and regulation of pesticides) Case 2: Mixture effects/combined exposure Studies indicate that incidences of disorders in the male reproductive system, including hypospadias in newborn boys, have risen during the last 50 years, but the impact of human exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals is largely unknown at present. Chemicals risk assessment is currently based on the no-observed- adverse-effect-levels (NOAELs) for effects of single compounds. Using this approach, single e ndocrine disrupting chemicals alone may appear to be present in human tissues at levels too low to cause concern for adverse reproductive effects. However, as several anti-androgenic chemicals ha ve been found as mixtures in humans, including children, the National Food Institute have investigated the ability of mixtures of anti-androgens to induce disruption of male sexu al differentiation after perinatal exposure in extensive dose- response studies. In the first mixture study on similarly acting anti-andr ogens (three AR-antagonists, vinclozolin, flutamide, and procymidone), the joint effects were essentially dose-additive for all endpoints. A combination of doses of each chemical that on its own did not produce significant effects induced marked mixture effects on anogenital distance (AGD,) nipple retention, the weight and histopathology of the seminal vesicles, and PBP C3 gene expression in the prostate, and caused marked dysgenesis of external reproductive organs on PND 16 [56-57]. Major events in the development of male external sex organs occur after postnatal day 16 during the pubertal period. Consequently, the frequencies of hypospadia and other external sexual malformations were recorded also in the young adult male rats. An additional aim was to examine if the antiandrogenic effects observed in the male pups were predictive of the external malformations (hypospadia) observable in the young adult male animals later in life. The mixture of 24.5 mg/kg/day vinclozolin, 0.77 in 60% of the male offspring, whereas the frequency after exposu re to the chemicals alone appeared similar to the untreated controls, i.e. 0% [58]. The second mixture study focused on the effects of four dissimilarly acting anti-androgens, and reproductive organ weights at P ND 16 were clearly affected in the mixture groups at dose levels where the individual chemicals alone caused no or only minor effects. The joint effects were equally well predicted by dose-addition or independent action. In addition, a very high frequency of external malformations such as hypospadias was seen for a mixture for which the individual compound ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 32 caused no significant effects. This mixture effect was worse than predicted based on dose-addition or independent action [59]. In conclusion, in vivo studies indicate that the joint effects of combined exposure to more anti-androgens in many cases can be predicted by dose-addition models and that marked effects can occur at doses below NOAELs for the single chemicals. The significance of these findings for human and environmental risk assessment should be emphasised, because they clearly indicate that risk assessment based on NOAELs for single antiandrogens alone might severely underestimate the risk for hypospadias and other adverse antiandrogenic effects. This work was part of the EU EDEN-project \"Endocrine Disrupters: Exploring Novel Endpoints, Exposure, Low Dose- and Mixture-Effects in Humans, Aquatic Wildlife and Laboratory Animal\" and was financially supported by the European Commission and the Danish EPA. As a follow-up to this work the DK EPA is hosting an expert workshop on combinat ion effects of endocrine disrupters with focus on regulatory aspects in January 2009. Furthermore, various Danish scientists continue research in this field e.g. in a new EU Cluster Project and also sponsored by the Danish EPA and the Nordic Council of Ministers. In 2006 the indications from animal studies regarding effects on the unborn child after combined exposures to endocrine disrupters together with a rising public awareness about these substances, lead to the campaign: \"Good chemistry to pregnant and nursing mothers - 9 good habits\". The campaign pointed out 9 easy ways to reduce the exposure of the mother and the baby to chemicals, including endocrine disrupters, in cosmetics, toys and baby products. Because of the indications and the awareness, Denmark is also working on the inclusion of combination effects of e ndocrine disrupters as an area of priority at the 5 th WHO Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health to be held in 2010. Furthermore, in the new European pesticides regulation, Denmark has promoted acceptance of establishment of cut-off criteria for non-inclusion of pesticides with certain especially concerning dangerous inherent properties, including endocrine disrupting properties. Case 3: Endocrine disruption in freshwater fish Endocrine disruption in fish was already in the late 1990'ies rather well investigated and the causal mechanisms were in contrast to other endocrine related effects rather well understood. This was the basis for establishing the Nordic work on developing an OECD test guideline for detection of endocrine disrupting effects of chemicals in Zebra fish in 1998. Since that time the work has been supported by the Danish EPA and the Nordic co-operation Nord-Utte [17, 19], and resulted in the development of the OECD test guideline proposal \"Fish Sexual Development Test\" (FSDT). In the FSDT, the endpoints are vitellogenin in male fish and change of the sex-ratio. The latter endpoint is directly relevant for risk assessment, whereas the former indicates a biological response to exposure. These endocrine related effects have been observed in exposed wild fish populations in Danish watercourses. After public debate a series of projects aiming at investigation of the cause and extent of these findings were initiated [3]. The first projects reviewed the methodologies available for measuring oestrogenic activity in vitro and for measuring the chemical substances causing the effects [10, 11]. Since the substances could originate from sewage treatment plants, a project was dedicated to investigate the degradation of oestrogens in sewage treatment plants [12]. These initial follow up projects were followed by a major project where the oestrogenic activity in effluents and surface water was monitored [24, 25]. Based on the data obtained in all these projects, it was concluded that the observed endocrine disruption in freshwater fish by far and most probably was caused by exposure to natural oestrogens (excreted to sewage by the female part of the population and to a minor extent by farm animals to manure and via agricultural run off to water courses) and not by exposure to synthetic oestrogens or othe r chemicals with oestrogenic activity. Furthermore, it ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 33 was concluded that the majority of Danish wastewater is treated sufficiently to reduce the amount of oestrogens released to the environment to a level which is considered of low significance. The projects has been followed up by more research-oriented activities aimed at studying the importance of oestrogens released to the environment when manure is used as fertiliser on farmland1. These studies have shown that oestrogens in cases of heavy rain may leach to drain-water from farm-land after up to 7 months after fertilising the agricultural fields with manure. The studies focused on the conditions in geographical regions with intense pig-farming (oestrogen rich manure from pregnant sows were used) and with soils where leaching have been shown to be influenced by preferential transport through soil-pores. The results may explain the findings of oestrogens in the previously mentioned surveys in cases where release of wastewater to the recipients can be excluded [86]. Case 4: Phthalates Use of phthalates, exposure of consumers and effects of phthalates in the environment in Denmark was investigated by the Danish EPA for the first time in 1984. The background for the investigation was indications of DEHP being carcinogenic and other phthalates being toxic to reproduction. Also, phthalates had been measured in the environment and had been shown to accumulate in aquatic organisms and sediments [37]. In 1993, phthalates were pointed out as a new group of problematic substances from waste treatment. Both the exposure and the effects contributed to the concern. Especially, DEHP had been observed in several environmental compartments, and human exposure was assumed, even though this had not been investigated. BBP and DBP were shown to be weak oestrogens in breast cancer cell lines, DEHP had been shown to be toxic to reproduction and induce damage to testes in animal studies and also DBP had been assessed as toxic to reproduction. Furthermore, DEHP was suspected to be carcinogenic, and DEP, BBP, DnOP, DINP, DIDP were proposed to be classified as dangerous for the environment. The investigations of phthalates were closely connected to discussions of the use of PVC [32]. In the EU programme for risk assessment of existing substances, a number of phthalates were prioritised [27]. The participation, completion and follow-up of these risk assessments have been of high priority in Denmark due to the concern arising from suspected exposure and effects. In 1996 the Danish EPA evaluated the human health effects of DEHP and other phthalates based on the available literature [26]. Also a review of environmental fate and effects of DEHP was performed [36]. Furthermore, environmental releases of DEHP from various types of polymers used for different purposes were monitored and estimated [84, 85]. Due to a nu mber of effects of DEHP on human health and the environment (chronic effects in the aquatic environment, decreased fertility and toxic effects on testes, oestrogenic and possible anti-androgenic effects in v itro and carcinogenicity), combined with the diffuse and widespread use of phthalates, an action plan to reduce and phase out the use of phthalates was published in 1999 [30] together with a strategy for decreasing use of PVC in Denmark [31]. The action plan focussed on the use of phthalates in soft PVC, which was estimated to cover 90% of the use of phthalates in Denmark. The aim was to reduce the use of phthalates with 50% during 10 years through a number of means: bans, taxes, grants, public green procurement and ecolabelling. Also increased knowledge about the effects and dispersal of phthalates and their alternatives was highly prioritised. At the same time the use of all phthalates in toys intended for children up to 3 years of age was banned. During the following years a number of projects focussing on alternatives to phthalates were published by the Danish EPA (Alternatives to soft PVC in the building i ndustry, in flexible PVC, in printing inks, paint and lacquer, glues, silicone products, rubber, molten metal) [33, 34, 35]. Also several surveys of the use of phthalates in cons umer products in Denmark were performed. Examples are: \"phthalates in products with PVC\" and \"Use of PVC and phthalates in Denmark year 2000 and 2001\" ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 34 [28, 29]. In 2003 the action plan was followed up by a st atus on the use of phthalates [21]. At that time DEHP and DBP had been classified in the EU as to xic to reproduction, and the status showed that the former use of DEHP consequently had decreased, whereas the consumption of DINP used as an alternative substance had increased. Also BBP and DIBP have in the EU been classified as toxic to reproduction. In 2007 a harmonized EU regulation banned 6 phthalates in toys intended for children up to 14 years of age (DEHP, DBP and BBP in all toys and DINP, DIDP and DNOP in toys if they can be put in the mouth). Denmark has maintained the ban of all phthalates in toys intended for children up to 3 years of age [22]. During the years the National Food Institute has conducted several experimental studies on different phthalates [47, 49, 50, 78, 80, 82] showing their endocrine activity and their endocrine disrupting properties. The DK EPA has used these studies as documentation for the reproductive effects of phthalates both within the EU programme for risk assessment of existing substances and in the subsequent restrictions of use of phthalates in consumer products. These studies have also contributed with important information in relation to the use of anogenital distance and nipple retention as new end-points for detect ion of endocrine disrupting effects and input for improvement of the TG 414 and the one-generation study.

SUMMARY Following the adoption by the Commission of a Comm unication to the Council and European Parliament on a \"Community Strategy for Endocrine Disrup ters\" in December 1999 (COM (1999)706), the Council invited the Commission to report regularly on the progress of the work. The first progress report was adopted in June 2001. A second progress report summarising the implementation of the Strategy during the period 2001-2003 was adopted in October 2004 (SEC (2004)1372). This is the third progress report on the implementation of the Strategy during the period 2004-2006. It describes the developments that have been made in terms of activities on prioritising substances for further investigation, stimulating research, agreeing test methods or adapting legislation. The \"Community Strategy for Endocrine Disrupters\" contains activities in the short, medium and long term. The short and medium term actions focus on gathering scientific data on \"candidate substances\" with a view to prioritising testing, guide research and monitoring efforts and to identify specific cases of consumer use and ecosystem exposure. The long-term actions focus on review and possible adaptation of policy and Community legislation. Considering that the \"endocrine disruption\" is not a toxicological endpoint per se, but it is a class of many mechanisms of action that may lead in different species to various types of effects which may result in adverse consequences on humans and ecosystems, the key shortterm action is the establishment of a priority list of substances for further evaluation of their endocrine disrupting effects. This prioritisation work started in the year 2000. A number of some 600 chemical substances (\"candidates\") have been screened, evaluated and a preliminary priority list was established. This work was completed at the end of 2006. The preliminary priority list of substances for further evaluation is not a negative list of substances but it is meant to provide a basis for gathering further data on endocrine disrupting effects of those substances and for their subsequent evaluation. The list was elaborated in a stepwise approach. Between 2000 and 2006 the Commission has contracted three studies on identification and evaluation of substances. In total 575 substances were investigated over the past six years as to their endocrine disrupting (ED) effects. In terms of prioritisation, it was found that, out of this number, 320 substances showed evidence or potential evidence for ED effects, while in total, 109 s ubstances were not retained in the priority list, either due to insufficient data on ED effects or insufficient scientific evidence. 147 substances have been excluded from the evaluation during the process as they were identified as double entries, mixtures or of doubtful relevance. An assessment of the legal status of the substances with evidence or potential evidence of endocrine disrupting effects showed, that the majority of them are already subject to a ban or restriction or are addressed under existing Community legislation, although for reasons not necessarily related to endocrine disruption. As regards medium-term actions, the Commission and Memb er States continue to participate in the OECD - Endocrine Disrupter Testing and Assessment Task Force (EDTA), which was set up in 1998 with the goal of developing agreed test methods for endocrine disrupters. The latest estimates are that agreed test methods for some environmental and human health effects will be finalised in 2007. Furthermore, addressing the medium term research and development objectives, endocrine disrupters were addressed under the 5th (FP5 - 1998-2001) and 6th (FP6 - 200 2-2006) EU Research Framework Programmes and ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 41 will also be addressed under the 7th Framework Programme of the European Community for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities (FP7 - 2007-2013). Regarding long term actions, relevant developments since 2004 were the adoption of the regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), formally adopted on 18 December 2006, the proposal for a directive setting environmental quality standards for priority substances under the water framework directive (2006) or the proposal for a regulation revising directive 91/414/EC on plant protection products (2006). ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 42 1. CONTEXT Endocrine Disrupters are a group of chemicals (natur al, synthetic, industrial chemicals or by-products) present in the environment and suspected to alter the functions of the endocrine system and, consequently, causing adverse health effects in an intact organism, or its offspring, or (sub) population. In wildlife, endocrine disrupters have clearly been shown to cause abnormalities and impaired reproductive performance in some species, and to be associated with changes in immunity, behaviour and skeletal deformities. In humans, endocrine disrupters have been suggested as being responsible for apparent changes seen in human health patterns over recent decades. These include declining sperm counts in some geographical regions, increased incidences in numbers of male children born with genital malformations and increased incidences of certain types of cancer that are known to be sensitive to hormones. More controversially, links have been suggested with impairment in neural development and sexual behaviour. In order to address the potential environmental and health impacts of endocrine disruption the Commission adopted a Communication to the Council and European Parliament on a \"Community Strategy for Endocrine Disrupters\" in December 1999. This Strategy sets out a number of actions relating to, inter alia , identification of substances, monitoring, research, international co-ordination and communication to the public. On 26 October 2000, the European Parliament adopted a Resolution on endocrine disrupters, emphasising the application of the precautionary principle and calling on the Commission to identify substances for immediate action. On 30 March 2000, the Environment Council adopte d \"Conclusions on the Commission Communication\" in which it stressed the precautionary principle, the need to develop quick and effective risk management strategies and the need for consistency with th e overall chemicals policy. The Council invited the Commission to report back on the progress of the work at regular intervals, and for the first time in early 2001. 2. PROGRESS ON SHORT-TERM ACTIONS As it is emphasized in the Opinion of the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) adopted in November 2005 1, \"endocrine disruption is not a toxicological endpoint per se, but is one class of the many mechanisms of action that may lead to various types of effects in different species, which may result in adverse consequences on humans and ecosystems\". The short-term actions have therefore focused on the need to gather up-to-date sc ientific information on endocrine disrupting effects and on the extent to which it is affecting people and wildlife. The work on identification and prioritisation of substances for further evaluation of their endocrine disrupting effects has continued and a preliminary priority list of the substances was established. 2.1. Establishment of a priority list of substances for further evaluation of their endocrine disrupting effects (see Attachment 1, Fig. 1) 2.1.1. Background Between the years 2000 and 2006 the Commission has contracted three studies on identification and evaluation of substances as to their endocrine disrupting effects. In June 2000, the study towards the establishment of a priority list of substances for further evaluation of their endocrine disrupting effects - preparation of a \"candidate list\" of substances as a basis for priority setting 2 (BKH-study), established a list 1 SCHER Opinion on \"Endocrine Disrupting a Non-animal Testing Approach\" (BUAV report-2004) 2 Study \"towards the establishment of a priority list of substances for further evaluation of their role in endocrinedisruption - preparation of a candidate list of substances as a basis for priority setting\" BKH, 2000 ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 43 of 553 candidate substances. Stakeholders, Member States and the Commission Scientific Committee on Toxicology, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE) were consulted on the approach and gave their input. Furthermore, a first list of 118 substances showing endocrine disrupting effects or potential endocrine disrupting effects was established. Out of these 118 substances indicating evidence or potential evidence of endocrine disrupting effects, 109 were already addressed under existing community legislation. In 2002, a follow up study \"on gathering info rmation on 435 substances with insufficient data\"3 (RPS-BKH-study) was carried out. It aimed on refi nement of the evaluation-methodology and on the investigation of the remaining 435 substances from the \"candidate list\" and also focused on candidate substances identified as High Production Volume Chem icals (HPVC), persistent in the environment and to which human- or wildlife-exposure could be expected. 204 substances were identified according to these criteria and their endocrine disrupting effects were evaluated. 147 of them were identified, showing either a clear evidence of endocrine disrupting effects or potential endocrine disrupting effects. For the substances that showed a clear evidence of endocrine disrupting effects, it was investigated if there is exposure concern for humans or wildlife. 84 of them showed high exposure concern, 5 showed medium and 4 substances showed low exposure concern. Out of 147 substances indicating evidence or potential evidence of endocrine disrupting effects, 129 were already addressed under existing community legislation. In the 2002 study, 172 candidate substances were reported as not yet evaluated, as they were supposed to be mainly Low Production Volume Chemicals (LPVC). 2.1.2 \"Study on enhancing the endocrine disrupter's pr iority list with a focus on low production volume chemicals\" (DHI -Study) In November 2005 the Commission, DG Environment, co ntracted \"DHI Water and Environment\" to carry out a further study 4, focusing on the remaining Low Pr oduction Volume Chemicals (LPVC). Commissioning this study, the Comm ission also took into account the recommendation from the former Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and Environment (CSTEE)5, where the committee stated that LPVC with high release in the environment or with high potency were not sufficiently covered in the previous work on the priority setting. Starting work, it turned out that 173 substances were left from the previous study and 22 substances were newly identified as candidates by stakeholders, therefore, in total 195 substances were identified for evaluation. After a first close look at the substances, it became obvious that many of them were neither LPVC nor HPVC, but they were produced in quantities lower then 10t/year. Furthermore, it turned out that 88 substances were of doubtful relevance as they were not listed in the existing chemicals database \"ESIS\" 6, an indication that they are not in use anymore, or not identified clearly by a single CAS N\u00b0. It was decided to exclude these 88, and thus, 107 substances remained for evaluation. As in the previous study, the evaluation of endocrine disrupting effects in humans or wildlife was based on the following screening criteria: persistency, production data, consumption/use patterns, environmental concentrations (range), evaluation of endocrine disrupting effects taking into consideration the relevance of the effects parameter, test reliability, dose-response relationship, endocrine disruption potency, endocrine disruption structure-activity relationships, comparison with systemic toxicity and evaluation of exposure concern to human and wildlife. The results of the evaluation were: out of 107 substances, 34 were showing 3 Study on \"gathering information on 435 substances with insufficient data\", RPS-BHK, November 2002. 4 Study on\" enhancing the endocrine disrupter priority list with a focus on low production volume chemicals\",DHI Water and Environment 2006 5 Opinion of the CSTEE on \"two study reports for en docrine disrupters by c-NSF and BKH Consulting Engineers\", November 6 ESIS: European chemical Substances Information System, DG JRC, European Chemicals Bureau ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 44 a clear evidence of endocrine disrupting effects in at least one intact organism (Category 1), 21 were showing some evidence, suggesting endocrine disruptin g potential (Category 2) and 52 substances showed insufficient data to decide on endocrine disrupting (ED) effects or there was no scientific basis for their inclusion in the priority list (Category 3a or 3b). Fo r results, see Attachment 2, Grouping of substances, Tables 1 - 5. Furthermore, for the 34 substances showing a clear evidence of endocrine disrupting effects, exposure concern to human or wildlife (Category 1) was evaluated. As only very few monitoring data sets were available for these substances, it was decided to base exposure evaluations on EUSES 7 calculations. EUSES is designed to be a decision support system fo r the evaluation of exposure of chemicals to man and the environment. Out of 34 substances, 12 substances showed high exposure concern, 16 substances showed medium and 6 substances showed low exposure concern. An assessment of the legal status of the DHI- evaluated substances with an evidence or potential evidence of endocrine disrupting effects showed, that 29 are already subject to a ban or restriction or are addressed under existing Community legislation, whereas 27 ar e not (see Attachment 2, Grouping of substances, Tables 1 - 3). During the DHI study, stakeholders, experts and Member States were involved at the very beginning, when input in terms of recent scientific data on the candidate substances in question as well as identification of further candidate substances was requested. Later on, they were involved again when the draft final report was subject to internet consultation during November 2006. Then, mainly experts replied, providing input on single substances evaluation as well as on the presentation of the report. Industry expressed its concern that the results of the evaluation of the substances could be misunderstood as full risk assessments. Moreover, industry expressed the concern that the priority list could be seen as a definitive list of substances and not as a list of substances for further evaluation of their endocrine disrupting effects. Industry also provided scientific data on some of the evaluated substances. All received comments were taken into account as far as possible. The final report of the DHI study is available on DG ENV's Endocrine Disrupters Website 8. 2.1.3. Preliminary priority list of substances for further evaluation of their endocrine disrupting effects The substances on the priority list are mainly man-made chemicals used in industry, agriculture and consumer products. Substances with a clear evidence of endocrine disrupting effects belong to many different groups of chemicals, e.g., alkylphenols and its derivatives, benzoates, chlorinated paraffines, phthalates, dioxins/furans, triazines or PCBs. The preliminary priority list of substances for further evaluation is not a negative list of substances but it is meant to provide a basis for gathering further data on endocrine disrupting effects of those substances and for their subsequent evaluation. The list now comprises in total 428 substances. Out of them, 194 showed a clear evidence of endocrine disrupting effects (Category 1), 125 showed a potential evidence of endocrine disrupting effects (Category 2), whereas 109 showed either no scientific basis for inclusion in the list or insufficient data to decide about (Category 3a or 3b). A database comprising all scientific information underlying the priority setting was established. It presents in a transparent manner the scientific data and references on human health, wildlife effects gathered in the three studies, as well as the categories in terms of priority concluded on that scientific basis. Compiling the database was one of the deliveries of the DHI - Study. The database is available on DG ENV's ndocrine Disrupters Website 9. 7 EUSES: European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances 8 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/endocrine/index_en.htm 9 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/endocrine/index_en.htm ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 45 For the future, it is planned to work on the database further by developing a methodology that makes the list iterative, meaning that substances can be included or released from it. The methodology to be developed needs to be broadly discussed with experts, Member States and stakeholders. The database will then serve as a \"dynamic working list\", ensuring that substances, where necessary, can continuously be fed into relevant legislation in order to manage risks properly. The assessment of the legal status of priority substances (Category 1 and Category 2) resulted in total in 269 substances that are already subject to a ban or restriction or addressed under existing Community legislation and 51 substances that are neither restricted nor being addressed. 3. PROGRESS ON MEDIUM-TERM ACTIONS As part of the medium-term actions, the Commission is supporting the development and validation of test methods by working closely with Member States to coordinate the European Union input to OECD. The medium-term actions also include research and development. 3.1. Identification and assessment of endocrine disrupters The availability of agreed test strategies/methods to identify and assess endocrine disrupting chemicals is a basic requirement for comprehensive legislative action aimed at protecting people and the environment from the potential dangers posed by these chemicals. The Commission participates in the OECD - Endocrine Disrupters Testing and Assessment Task Force (EDTA), which was set up in 1998 under the authority of the National Co-ordinators for the Test Guidelines Programme. The aim of the Task Force is to develop an internationally harmonised testing strategy as well as coordinating and overseeing the work of different sub-groups charged with developing new or revising existing test guidelines to assess the potential endocrine disrupting properties of chemicals. The Task Force met for the tenth time in spring 2007. The latest estimates are that agreed test methods for human health effects will be finalised in 2007. In particular, an in vivo test guideline for screening for estrogenic effects, uterotrophic assay, will be most probably available by the end of 2007. Other draft in vivo test guidelines like the Hershberger assay or revised test guideline 407 are under development and might be available from 2008 onwards. Test methods for environmental effects include fish screening assay, amphibian metamorphosis assay and some invertebrate tests (e.g. copepod test). The first agreed test guidelines are estimated to be available by 2008. Alternative non animal test methods for ED screening are also progressing under the auspices of the OECD. In particular, a draft OECD test guideline for agonist estrogenic assessment using an in vitro estrogen receptor (ER) transcriptional activation assay has been submitted by Japan and was peer reviewed earlier this year. The EC/JRC is collaborating with the US and Japan on the validation of (ER) binding assays, androgen receptor (AR) binding assays and steroidogenesis assays. An overview of the ED test methods that are currently in (pre)validation under the auspices of the OECD is set out in Attachment 3. 3.2. Research and development Under the Fifth Framework Programme (FP5, 1999-2001), over 60 million euros were spent on 23 projects dealing with endocrine disrupters. The final reports of most of these projects are available 10. As a direct 10 http://ec.europa.eu/research/quality-of-life/ka4/ka4_reports_en.html ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 46 response to the call to enhance research efforts by the European Commission's Strategy on endocrine disrupters, the CREDO cluster (Cluster of Research into Endocrine Disruption in Europe) was established11. It was launched in April 2003 and will last until 2007. Four projects with a total budget of approximately 20 million EUR participated in the cluster encompassing 63 laboratories in Europe. The cluster was co-ordinated by the EDEN project 12. CREDO has until now already greatly contributed to improving the knowledge about endocrine disruption. The projects funded under FP5 focused on a number of issues such as hazard and risk characterisation of various groups of endocrine disrupters; epidemiological approaches to exposure assessment including the use of biomarkers and birth cohorts; development of new methods and tests for analysis of toxicity; the role of genetic susceptibility in disease development; and investigation of mechanisms of disease development in various organs in 'real life' exposure situations (i.e., with low doses and multiple exposures). Endocrine-related reproductive effects were also widely studied, showing correlations especially between exposure to various chemicals and reproductive parameters in a variety of animal models and also in human studies. Furthermore, the projects observed neurobehavioural effects of some chemicals. In particular, elevated polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) serum concentration was correlated with poor sensomotor function in children. Finally, work on multiple effects of endocrine disrupters gave contradictory results with some research demonstrating no morphological effects, whil e others found effects, elaborated mechanisms and proposed risk assessment for non-reproductive organs in humans. The Sixth Research Framework Programme (FP6, 2002-2006), addressed different topics related to endocrine disruption. By the end of FP6, 10 projects with at least some relevance to the area of endocrine disrupters were funded, with EC contributions of around 50 million EUR in total. The adoption of the European Environment and Health Action Plan in 2004 has served as a stimulus for research, as one of the goals of this Action Plan is to understand health impacts of endocrine disrupters 13 in view of co-ordinating risk reduction measures, which is one of the recommendations of this Action Plan. The recently published mid-term review14 of the Action Plan has acknowledged significant progress in better identification of the mechanisms for co-ordinating risk reduction measures. It is, however, recognized that \"more work needs to be done in linking research on priority diseases to appropriate policy processes and information systems\". The projects supported under FP6 focus on the studies of health outcomes after exposure to chemicals with potential neuroimmune or endocrine mediated effects or develop test methods for their detection. Some projects have also addressed the issue in a context of integrated environment and health risk assessments. The integrated project REPROTECT 15, led by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) with 32 participating European groups, began in July 2004 with an EC contribution of 9.1 million EUR, and a total budget of 13.2 million EUR over 5 years. The aim is to validate a conceptual framework in the area of reproductive toxicity and to develop a substantial number of alternative test methods making use of advanced technologies. Within this project, six tests for assessing (anti)estrogenic and (anti)androgenic compounds have been optimised and are now being analysed for predictive power. Two of these tests are continuing validation under the auspices of the OECD. These in vitro tests could contribute to substantially reduce the number of animals that are currently required in reproductive toxicity testing. Furthermore, such methods have discrete advantages that go beyond reduced speed, cost and animal use, such as the possibility to use human cells and receptors. 11 http://www.credocluster.info/ 12 http://www.edenresearch.info 13 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/health/index_en.htm 14 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2007/com2007_0314en01.pdf 15 http://www.reprotect.eu ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 47 The CASCADE project has started in 2004 with an EC contribution of 14.4 million EUR during five years16. CASCADE brings 24 research groups from nine EU member states together in a network for durable coordination and integration of research on chemical residues in food, especially chemicals with endocrine disrupting properties. In addition, the following projects are of relevance to the field of endocrine disruption: NEWGENERIS 17 focusing on the role of exposure to genotoxic chemicals (including endocrine disrupters) in the development of childhood cancer and immune disorders, PHIME18 focusing on public health impact of long-term, lowlevel mixed element exposure in susceptible population strata, BIOCOP19 working on new technologies to screen multiple chemical contaminants in food and NOMIRACLE20 developing novel methods and tools to better evaluate chemical risks. INTARESE21 aims at producing a new integrated risk assessment framework, based on the full chain appro ach (causal chain spanning sources of pollution, releases into various media, dispersion and transport, exposure medium inhalation/dermal contact/ingestion, intake, uptake, dose, health effects and impacts). It includes household chemicals. Another two integrated projects, HEIMTSA and 2-FUN, which started in 2007, aim at further enhancing the full chain methodology and extending it to cover monetary valuation of health impacts from environmental stressors, including endocrine disruptin g chemicals, and the health impacts of combined exposure to them and other stressors. These projects are expected to develop computational tools for assessing the health impacts of Community policies linked to chemicals such as endocrine disrupters. Moreover, eight \"Specific Targeted Research Projects\" with EC contributions between 1-5 million EUR and a duration of up to four years, as well as a few Coordination Actions/Specific Support Actions were financed. The projects funded by FP6 related to endocrine disrupters are listed in the annex of the mid-term review report of the Environment and Health Action Plan published in June 2007 22. Funding of research on endocrine disrupters will continue in the Se venth Research Framework Programme (FP7, 2007-2013). Theme 6 'Environment' as an example, will include an \"Environment and Health\" activity which will fund, among others, research related to health impacts of chemicals including endocrine disrupters. In addition, the JRC has been developing toxicogenomic capabilities for studying the biological basis underlying endocrine disruption in the context of its work on human exposure to environmental stressors and health effects. The JRC also held an expert workshop on molecular modelling approaches for human hazard assessment of chemicals (2006) using endocrine disruption and metabolism as case studies (report in preparation). This workshop identified promising in si lico approaches for ED hazard assessment testing batteries which are now being followed up in the JRC led validation programme. A webpage on endocrine disrupter-related research was created by DG Research 23 and the JRC24 will soon host the database on endocrine disrupting chemicals developed under the DG ENV's contracted studies (part 2.1.3. above). 16 www.cascadenet.org www.phime.org 23 http://ec.europa.eu/research/endocrine/index_en.html 24 http://ecb.jrc.it ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 48 4. PROGRESS ON LONG-TERM ACTIONS The long-term actions include the review and adaptation of existing legislation, governing testing, assessment and use of chemicals and substances within the EU. 4.1. Legislative actions 4.1.1. Regulation (EC) N\u00b0 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) The Regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) 25 was formally adopted on 18 December 2006 by the Council of Environment Ministers following the vote in second reading of the European Parliament on 13 December 2006. REACH has entered into force on 1 June 2007. One of the key elements of REACH is an authorisation procedure for substances of very high concern. Substances of very high concern include those that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction (CMRs), categories 1 and 2. Furthermore, substances m eeting the regulation's criteria for being persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBTs) or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvBs) are also of very high concern. In addition, substances that are not c overed by the CMR-, PBT- or vPvB- criteria can be identified on a case-by-case basis when they are causing serious and irreversible effects to humans or the environment, which are equivalent to those of the CMRs, PBTs and vPvBs. These substances are then considered to be \"of equivalent concern\" and can also be subject to authorisation as far as they are proposed to be put on the \"candidate list\" for incl usion in Annex XIV prioritised for authorisation. Substances of \"equivalent concern\" include those having endocrine disrupting properties. The identification of the substances of very high concern starts on the initiative of the Commission or Member States and leads to the establishment of the candidate list. The \"endocrine disrupter priority list\" could be used as a reference material for this process. A guidance document on how Member States should choose and justify their proposals for substances of equivalent concern is currently being prepared by the European Chemicals Bureau 26. The authorisation procedure requires the Commission to give specific permission before a substance subject to authorisation could be used for a particular purpose, marketed as such or as a component of a product. Given that many of the serious human health effects which have so far been associated with endocrine disrupting chemicals are testicular cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, decrease in sperm quality, cryptorchidism and hypospadia, it is likely that many substances will fall under this authorisation procedure directly as a CMR substance. Furthermore, adverse effects on the endocrine system of wildlife species have been causally linked o certain persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances. Such substances would be subject to authorisation as a result of their PBT-properties. It should be noted that many of the priority substances are pesticides and by-products formed, for example, during combustion, and therefore they are not within the scope of REACH. The number of substances out of the endocrine disrupter priority list that could be expected to be identified, on a case-by-case basis, as substances of \"equivalent concern\" as defined in REACH, might potentially be a few dozen. 25 Regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals, establishing a European Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) N\u00b01488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEX, 93/67/EEC and 2000/21/EC 26 RIP-4.3: Guidance document on Inclusion of Substances in Annex XIV ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 49 4.1.2. Directive 2000/60/EC establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (Water Framework Directive) and Directive 2006/118/EC on the protection of groundwater against pollution and deterioration The Water Framework Directive (WFD) sets environmental objectives of good chemical status for surface waters and for the prevention of pollution of groundwater. For surface waters , the Directive provides for a two-tiered approach to control chemical pollution, which includes actions at national level and EU wide action. At the national level , Member States are required to identify chemical pollutants of significance for each of the water bodies (an indicative list of the main pollutants is included in the Annex VIII of the Directive), to set quality standards for the water, to establish emission control measures and to achieve these standards by 2015. A specific category includes those \"substances and preparations, or the breakdown products of such, which have proved to possess carcinogenic or mutagenic properties which may affect steroidgenic, thyroid, reproduction or other endocrinerelated functions in or via the aquatic environment\" (Annex VIII - Group 4). This means that there is an obligation for Member States to take action to prevent human exposure of endocrine disrupting substances via the aquatic environment. This action shall be coordinated in river basins, and a programme of measures shall be in place in 2009 and become operational in 2012. At the Community level, the WFD sets out a strategy against pollution of surface waters by chemical pollutants (Article 16). This strategy includes the identification of substances of particular concern at Community level, and the adoption of environmental quality standards and emission controls for such substances. The first list of 33 substances was adopted in 2001 (Decision 2455/2001/EC), and the Commission adopted a proposed Directive (COM (2006)397) setting environmental quality standards for these substances in 2006, as well as a related Communication (COM (2006)398). It should be noted that, out of these 33 substances, 21 are candidate endocrine disruptor substances for which an evidence or potential evidence of endocrine disrupting effects was found during the priority setting process in the years 2000-2003. The list of substances is to be reviewed every four years, and as further knowledge regarding endocrine disrupting properties is gathered, this information could be taken into account in the future prioritisation of substances for action at Community level. From the first priority list, certain substances can also be classified as \"priority hazardous\" and should be subject to complete phase-out of all emissions, losses and discharges during a 20-year timeframe. Endocrine disr upting effects could become an important factor for sorting substances or groups of substances into this group. Regarding groundwater, the new Groundwater Directive (developed under Article 17 of the WFD) was adopted on 12 December 2006 (Directive 2006/118/EC). It requests Member States to establish threshold values (groundwater standards for defining the gro undwater good chemical status) for all pollutants representing a risk to groundwater, taking a minimum list of pollutants (Annex III of the directive) into consideration. Although endocrine disrupters are not explicitly listed, in principle, they could be covered by this clause if Member States identified them and considered that they could represent a risk for the pollution of groundwater. This proposal also includes the requirement to identify and reverse a significant increasing trend in pollutant concentrations, which would implicitly cover endocrine disrupters if they have been identified as representing a pollution risk. Regarding prevention, direct and indirect inputs of pollutants are regulated both by the Water Framework Directive and the Groundwater Directive proposal (Article 6 of the proposal), thus ensuring a continuity of the protection regime of Directive 80/68/EEC which will be repealed in 2013. Along this principle, inputs of hazardous substances have to be prevented, while inputs of non-hazardous pollutants have to be limited to avoid groundwater pollution. 4.1.3. Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 50 Directive 91/414/EEC sets out a Community harmonise d framework for authorisation, use and control of plant protection products. In 1992, the European Commission started a Community-wide review process for all active ingredients used in plant protection products within the European Union. The review should make sure that active substances can be used safely regarding human health, the environment, ecotoxicology and residues in the food chain. It will be completed in 2008. The issue of possible endocrine disrupting properties of active substances used in plant protection products is not yet fully incorporated in the risk assessment procedures because of lack of harmonised and internationally-agreed test protocols. But the competent authorities in the EU have identified this gap and have highlighted the need for a test procedure which could confirm whether or not \"identified candidates\" are real endocrine disrupting substances. Work on this matter is ongoing at the OECD and it is foreseen that as soon as agreed test methodologies are endorsed, these would be integrated into the assessment procedures applied in the Community risk assessment. In the meantime, where substances are currently being evaluated and where there is a suspicion of endocrine disrupting potential of a substance, additional testing has been requested and performed, and the results assessed. Several substances have so far been tested according to a specific protocol called \"fish fu ll life cycle test\". The results of these tests have allowed competent authorities to resolve doubts about those substances. Apart from technical aspects that are expected to be solved in the near future, cons ideration of endocrine disrupting properties of active substances would receive greater priority in decision-making. The new proposal for a regulation revising Directive 91/414/EEC, which was adopted by the Commission in July 2006, includes provisions that prohibit the use of active substances that have been identified as endocrine disruptors, unless the exposure of humans to the active substance in a plant protection product, under realistic proposed conditions of use, is negligible. 4.1.4. Directive 98/8/EC concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market Within this Directive, active substances are being evaluated and authorised for biocidal applications after the risk for man and environment has been assessed. This assessment also takes into consideration the potential adverse effects that rise from exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals. Although a specific evaluation strategy for the assessment of endocrine disrupting effects is not explicitly described within this Directive, these adverse effects are taken into account when assessing risks associated with the use of the substances. These aspects are also taken into account in the specific \"PBT Working Group\" assessing the persistence, bioaccumulative and toxic properties of biocides. Like all other legislative actions, also Directive 98/8/EC will benefit from the final acceptance of the standardized testing methods at the OECD level. 4.1.5. Directive 96/22/EC concerning the prohibition on the use in stock-farming of certain substances having a hormonal or thyrostatic action and beta-agonists The use of substances having an oestrogenic, gestagenic or androgenic effect is restricted under Directive 96/22/EC concerning the prohibition on the use in stockf arming of certain substances having a hormonal or thyrostatic action and betaagonists, as amended by Directive 2003/74/EC . The Directive prohibits the use of substances having a hormonal action for growth promotion in farm animals and identifies precise circumstances under which they may be administered to food producing animals for other purposes.

French regulatory authorities do not currently assess the endocrine disrupters properties yet within any national chemicals regulation. However, France has two main government programmes to assess impact of general environmental factors on workers and general population. These programmes, the so-called PNSE (National En vironment and Health action Plan) and PST (Occupational and Health action Plan), are objective programs, which determine the main research axis in a defined time-scale. 2. PNSE (2004-2008) 1 cover the entire field of relationships between the environment and human health. One of the three major goals of this programme is to prevent environmental exposure associated diseases. Among the 45 actions, 2 actions concern the endocrine disrupter as action 11 to limited water and soils pollution caused by pesticides and other potentially dangerous substances including endocrine disrupters compounds and action 34 to reinforce and coordinate the calls for research projects to improve knowledge on the presence and effects of several kind of compounds (endocrine disrupters compounds are included) to facilitate public decision. 3. PST (2005-2009) is specifically dedicated to workers and completes PNSE. PST aims to improve professional risk prevention. Objective 1 of PST is to develop knowledge in professional domain, to coordinate the use of the means assigned to the research finalized in support with the public policies and coordinate the calls for research projects to improve knowledge on the presence and effects of several kinds of compounds to facilitate public decision (i.e. endocrine disrupters compounds, specifically the reprotoxic ones). Objective 4, according to REACH European Regulation, promotes the principle of substituti on of the most dangerous chemical substances: CMR, PBT, vPvB and endocrine disrupters. The programmes described below are included in these frameworks. Governmental Programme, Several classes of Ch emicals: Industrial Existing Chemicals and Pesticides. 4. According to the previously cited programmes, the French Ministry of Ecology and Sustainable Development (MEEDDAT) develops a programme specifically directed on the assessment of endocrine disrupters compounds: PNRPE. 5. The National Research Program into Endocrine Disrupters (PNRPE) was proposed by the Minister and launched in 2004 following the recommendations of the Prevention and Precaution Committee (CPP) based on an enquiry into endocrine disrupters (conclusions published in December 2003). This program aims to answer calls from public authorities and support fundamental and applied multidisciplinary research into screening methodologies, mechanisms for action, the search for effects biomarkers, the movement and transformati on of endocrine disrupters in the organism and the environment, the identification of dangers, the evaluation of risks, surveillance and connected socioeconomic aspects. The first Call for Research Proposals was launched in May 2005 and resulted in the selection of 7 structural projects. Abstracts of these projects are only available in French at http://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/-Projets-retenus,1917-.html , and the restitution of results should occur during autumn 2008. A new Call for Research was launched in June 2008 to continue efforts and respond to questions raised by the previous 7 projects. Finally in the framework of REACH procedure, the installation of the PNRPE is an important tool in the evaluation of the toxicity of several chemical pollutants as endocrine disrupters. 1 Summary available in English on Afsset website : http://www.afsset.fr/upload/bibliotheque/422558914315638390228017937553/2004_2008_pnse_abstract_en_260707.pdf ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 68 Strategy under development, Industrial Existing Chemicals: Methodology to build Toxicological Reference Values (VTR) based on reproduction and development toxic effects. 6. In France, parallel to the great programs, there are specific questions coming from the ministries to the Health Agencies: the so-called \"saisines\". According to action 21 of PNSE (\"to develop tools for better evaluating biological or chemical substa nces health hazards\"), the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (AFSSET) has taken a \"saisine\" to evaluate some Glycol Ethers, and in this framework, in order to improve expertise in France in this domain, AFSSET had established a national programme on VTR based on reproduction and development toxic effects. 7. VTR is a value making it possible to establish a quantitative and/or qualitative relationship between an exposure to a chemical substance and an adverse health effect on human (also known as reference doses (RFD), or minimal risk level (MRL)). VTR are used to build qualitative aims of the mediums of the environment, guidelines values, recommendations or standards. 8. AFSSET sets up an inter establishments task force Afssa, and UIC 2 in order to propose a reference methodology for the construction of VTR on reproduction and development for toxic substances and to identify which substances could be the priority in order to build such VTR. This concern, included in a European context, mainly aims at developing a critical analysis on the choice and the construction of VTR for the most alarming reprotoxic chemical substances. Two reports 3 has been published: - Identification of a list of toxic substances for reproduction and development, proposition of a hierarchy to analyze VTR, 2005. - Reference document to build a VTR based on reprotoxic effects, 2006. 9. Then, within the framework of the development me thod of construction of reprotoxic VTR, a pilot phase was carried out to \"test\" the methodology suggested by the task force on some model substances. For this purpose, AFSSET called upon several organizations of expertise to build, according to the reference document of the task force, the reprotoxic VTR of the following substances 4: This work, issued from a saisine in the framework of PNSE (action 21 and 24), details the development method of VTR based on reprotoxic effects, when well even a VTR numerically 2 Afssa : Agence Fran\u00e7aise de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Sanitaire Aliments et de Toxicovigilance ; Cnam : Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers ; CNRS : Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ; ENSP : Ecole Nationale de la Sant\u00e9 Publique ; Ineris : Institut National de l'environnement et des risques industriels ; INRS : Institut National de Recherc he et de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 ; Inserm : Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale ; InVS : Institut de Veille Sanitaire ; UIC : Union des Industries Chimiques. 3 Reports are available in French only, but a poster is available in English on AFSSET website : www.afsset.fr 4 Reports are available in French only on AFSSET website : www.afsset.fr ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 69 weaker exists or could be developed on non-reprot oxic effects. The construction of a VTR for a specific effect reprotoxic is justified by: - the description of effects on the development occurring for particular exposure times (short window of exposure); - the need for having an answer specific to the reprotoxic effects 11. France is aware that reprotoxic compounds are no t necessary endocrine disrupters; however, many of the substances tested interfere on endocrine-dependent system, which make them endocrine disrupters suspects. 12. In order to continue these topics, a new PNSE 2 is being established, and a new Reprotoxic VTR task force is being created. 13. In addition, some systems of surveillance concerning the interaction between reproduction and environment exist, with principally, a register (for congenital malformations, stillbirth...), an epidemiologic observatory of fertility in France or a record of health event (by CECOS which is the center of studies and conservation of eggs and sperm). ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 70 Appendix 4 Contribution from Germany ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 71 German contribution to the development of a Re port on Endocrine Disrupters Assessment in OECD Member Countries HUMAN HEALTH This section will be provided later ENVIRONMENT: Legal Background 2.1.1 REACH Article 57 (f) of EU Directive 1907/2006 REACH faci litates to submit endocrine disrupters to authorisation. For this, criteria and data necessary for proof are not specified in detail so far. In each individual case a decision is necessary whether the substance in question 'for which there is scientific evidence of probable serious effects to human health or the environment which give rise to an equivalent level of concern to those of other substances listed in the points (a) to (e)' (CMR, PBT, vPvB). 2.1.2 Biocides Directive 98/8/EC Concerning of Biocidal Products on the Market addresses endocrine effects in article 38: 'In those cases where the test appropriate to hazard identification in relation to a particular potential effect of an active substance or a substance of concern present in a biocidal product has been conducted but the results have not led to classification of the biocidal product then risk characterisation in relation to that effect shall not be necessary unless there are other reasonable grounds for concern. Such grounds may derive from the properties and effects of any active substance or substance of concern in the biocidal product, in particular: any indications of bioaccumulation potential, the persistence characteristics, the shape of the toxicity/time curve in ecotoxicity testing, indications of other adverse effects on the basis of toxicity studies (e.g. classification as a mutagen), data on structurally analogous substances, endocrine effects' Still the directive does not include special data requirements to clarify an endocrine mechanism. Therefore any request for studies on endocrine effects in the assessment of biocidal products - even with justified suspicion - is difficult. 2.1.3 Plant Production Products The current Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market makes not direct reference on endocrine disruption but indirectly via requirements of chronic studies such as a requirement of a fish full life cycl e test in certain cases. In the guidance documents on aquatic testing and terrestrial testing endocrine disruption is addressed without a testing strategy. The proposed EU regulation on the marketing of plant protection products however is supposed to address among others endocrine disruptors to be candidates for substitution. 2.1.4 Pharmaceuticals EU Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community C ode Relating to Medicinal Products for Human Use does not include any special assessment of endocrine eff ects. In the 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 dated 01.06.2006) includes a text passage that certain substances such as lipophilic compounds and potential endocrine ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 72 disrupters may need to be addressed irrespective of the quantity released into the environment (action value 10 ng/L predicted environmental concentration (PEC)). In EU Directive 2001/82/EC on the Community Code Re lating to Veterinary Medicinal Products hormonal effects are only directly addressed in Article 68 '1. Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that only persons empowered under their national legislation in force possess or have under their control veterinary medicinal products or substances which may be used as veterinary medicinal products that have anabolic, anti-infectious, anti-parasitic, anti-inflammatory, hormonal or psychotropic properties. In 'Guideline on the Environmental Impact A ssessment for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP/VICH/592/98-final dated 30.06.2000) hormones are excluded from an extended environment assessment in phase I when only single animals are treated. In phase II (CVMP/VICH/790/03-final dated October 2004) endocrine disruption is dealt with as other mechanisms and is not mentioned separately. Existing Concepts and developments Concerning the environmental assessment endocrine disruption can generally be assessed on a risk basis.. Except for REACH no testing strategy for endocrine disr uption in the regulatory substance assessment in Germany (EU) exist. A general screening for endocrin e disruption is not intended in any legal framework and case-by-case decisions on preliminary indication are necessary. Depending on the legislative background it is possible to require the respective studies from applicants to assess endocrine effects. To address this problem in Germany a workshop t ook pl ace on 'Characterization of endocrine mediated effects in fish' with representatives of academia, industry and administration. The workshop discussed besides others the issues of 1) What constitutes for environmental relevant substances (e.g. PPP, industrial chemicals) a suspicion for endocrine disruption? 2) Weight of evidence: According to which rules a decision for a fish screening assay (FSA) is made?; 3) Function of FSA: Clarifying the mode of action (moa)? Use of results in regulatory decision making? Definite test: (...) 6) Which test is suitable: full life cycle test (FLCT) or 2-generation-test (2-GT)? 20, Nr. 3, August 2008). So far available in German only. Funded by the German environmental research programme UFOPLAN, the R+D project 20467454/02 has been conducted to feed into German contributions to the OECD EDTA special activity of the Test Guidelines Programme. The project aimed specifically on further development and (pre)validation of a FLCT with the zebrafish ( Danio rerio), with particular view on identifying most relevant endpoints, and including a conceptual approach on how the FLCT can be applied as a definitive test for determining the toxicity of endocrine disrupting chemicals in fish. To achieve this objective, (1) existing data on relevant fish tests from literature according to specific ED-related mode-of-actions had been compiled and evaluated, (2) data gaps had been identified that might require the performance of FLCTs with substances showing specific ED-related mode-of-actions; (3) th ree FLC (2-generation) studies had been conducted with trenbolone, flutamide, and tamoxifene as test substances. The final project report is expected to be published by end of 2008. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 73 REACH The detailed technical guidance documents to REACH give for the first time in a regulatory relevant document a concrete instructions that can mainly be found as appendix R.7.8-5 page 102 in part R.7b5 of the guidance on information requirements and chemical safety assessment. The guidance document describes in principle a risk oriented procedure in three steps (1. Preliminary indication , 2. Indication of specific endocrine modes of action in intact aquatic organisms , 3. Characterisation of longterm adverse effects ). The third step has a special role when a causal link between endocrine effect and adverse population relevant effects are the basis for bringing a substance in authorization according to art. 57 (f). Biocides No concepts exist so far. Decision on testing for endocrine disruption are made on a case-by-case study. Because of missing legal background for data requirements (see 2.1.2) in most cases no further studies can be required even with justified suspicion. Plant Production Products According to the legal background chronic studies can be required and therefore studies to verify an existing endocrine effect of a plant production product (PPP). Still no general testing strategy or screening for endocrine disrupters in the PPP assessment exists. Therefore decisions on testing for endocrine disruption are made on a case-by-case basis (see case study on DMI-Fungizide point 2.3) taking into account mechanisms of the active agents, chemical structure and others. The status and concept so far developed to assess endocrine disruptors under the pesticide's regime is summarized in the paper \"Identification, Charac terization and Environmental Risk Assessment of Endocrine Mediated Adverse Effects of Plant Protection Products and their Active Ingredients in the German Authorization Procedure (Responsible authority: UBA, Federal Environment Agency)\", attached as Attachment 1. Pharmaceuticals No concepts exist. Because of available data on mechanisms of the active agent endocrine effects are more easily detected and further testing can be demanded than according to the legal background (see 2.1.4) Case Studies During the last 2 - 3 years the endocrine effects of DMI-fungicides were assessed in the framework of the plant protection product authorization. From that work resulted a project report on 'Characterisation of endocrine mediated impacts on fish. Relevant parameters for the development of a new OECD test method and the application in regulatory environmental risk assessment'. The report is available in German only but an English abstract exist: 'Scope of the study was the collection and comparison of existing experience with fish full life cycle studies on endocrine disrupting chemicals to derive general conclusions about endpoint sensitivity and help reducing uncertainties in the assessment. Characteris tic population relevant and indicative endpoints for relevant direct sexual endocrine Modes of Action (MoA) were identified and compared for sensitivity. The data base consisted of Full Life Cycle Tests (FLCT) and two-generation tests by the Fraunhofer IME and from literature. Based on the results, test data from the UBA regulatory data base were tried to classify. In the second part, biomarker data from Fish Screening Assays (FSA) were compared with the effect data from population relevant FLCT endpoints and assessed according to sensitivity and predictive potential to 5 URL: http://reach.jrc.it/docs/guidance _document/information_requirements_r7b_en.pdf?vers=30_07_08 ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 74 derive a proposal for a tiered test strategy for potentially endocrine disrupting chemicals. The most sensitive exposure period for interactions with the estrogen receptor (ER) is the sexual development phase. The most sensitive manifestation endpoint is the reduction of the fertilization rate, the sensitivity of juvenile growth and sex manifestation being very cl ose. The vitellogenin (VTG) measurement in a FSA is comparably sensitive. When using it as a lower tier test, a false negative result is not expected. Androgen receptor-(AR-) interactions have to be differentiated in the agonistic and antagonistic MoA. For both, VTG is not always a powerful biomarker. Fecundity is the most sensitive population relevant endpoint for the investigated AR antagonist; the most sensitive indica tive endpoint in the FSA and the two-generation test is the enhanced sexual steroid 11-keto-testosterone. Regarding the AR agonists, sexual development is the most sensitive exposure period, the sex ratio being the most sensitive endpoint. Sufficiently sensitive biomarkers were not identified. Sexual developmen t is also the most sensitive exposure period for aromatase inhibitors, becoming manifest in different endpoints with close sensitivity: the shift towards males in sex ratio, growth retardation or fecundity. VTG reduction was sensitive in the definitive tests as well as in the FSA. The investigated fish species we re principally comparably sensitive towards hormone receptor interaction. The manifestation of effects may differ, i.e., in Medaka and Fathead Minnow, ER agonists cause femalization, whereas arrested in their male protogyne development phase; zebrafish seem to be more sensitive to masculinisation by aromatase inhibition, whereas Fathead minnow seems to be more sensitive in a reduction of juvenile growth. Whether a two-generation test should be performed instead of a FLCT depends on the relevance of maternal effect transfer and could not be clarified due to a lack of comparable data. For using a shortened test procedure instead of a FLCT or two- generation test, precise information about the MoA is necessary as well as evidence on whether the shortened protocol is appropriate to cover the most sensitive exposure period and the most sensitive population relevant endpoint. Partial life cycle tests, such as short-term reproduction tests, thus can never be appropriate. The Fish Sexual Development Test (FSDT) could be the adequate test for AR agonists and aromatase inhibitors. The Early Life Stage or Juvenile Growth Test can be used for DMI-fungicides for a sufficiently safe extrapolation to FLCT results to perform a preliminary regulatory risk assessment.' Another expert report on the issue of the DMI-fungicides was commissioned by the 'Industrieverband Agrar - IVA (Industrial Association Agriculture) under the title 'Assessment of the safety of an extrapolation from growth data of Early Life Stag e- and Juvenile Growth Tests (OECD 210, 204, 215) to the NOEC of Fish Full Life Cycle Tests in the risk assessment of DMI-fungicides'. The expert report is attached as Attachment 2 to this document. GERMAN INDUSTRY The Verband der Chemischen Industrie e. V. (VCI - the German chemical industry association) is engaged in the political and technical discussion on endocrine disruption. For the proposals of the VCI for testing strategies (toxicological and ecotoxicological) it is referred to the documentation in the 'VCI overview on endocrine active substances' which is published on the VCI website (http://www.vci.de/default2~rub~0~tma~0~cmd~shd~docnr~116782~nd~.htm ). VCI also participated at the German workshop on the 'Characterization of endocrine mediated effects in fish'. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 75 Attachment 1 IDENTIFICATION, CHARACTERIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENT OF ENDOCRINE MEDIATED ADVERSE EFFECTS OF PLANT PROTECTION PRODUCTS AND THEIR ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN THE GERMAN AUTHORIZATION PROCEDURE (RESPONSIBLE AUTHORITY: UBA, FEDERAL ENVIRONMENT AGENCY) 1. Basically, UBA considers the risk-based procedure as established by EU Directive 91/414/EEG also applicable to those plant protection products and their active ingredients which provoke adverse effects in non-target organisms by a disturbance of the endocrine system (so called \"endocrine disrupters\"). 2. This perception is in line with the state of the science in ecotoxicology and compliant to e.g. the guidance document SANCO/4145/2000 associated to Directive 91/414/EEG: \"Endocrine disruption is to be viewed as one of the many existing modes of action of chemicals and thus can be assessed in the normal conceptual framework. The environmental assessment is based on the ecological relevance of the observed effects, independently on the mechanisms of action responsible for such effects. Therefore, the general procedure for risk assessment can also be used for endocrine disrupters.\" 3. However, the availability of adequate (i.e. endocrine specific) strategies for the testing and assessment of endocrine mediated effects in non-target organisms including the respective biological test procedures is an essential pre-requisite for any reliable risk assessment. At present, internationally agreed endocrine specific testing and assessment strategies are lacking for all relevant groups of non-target organisms in order (i) to systematically identify potential endocrine disrupters, (ii) to mechanistically characterize endocrine mediated effects and (iii) to reliably derive thresholds of no-concern and regulatory acceptable concentrations, respectively for endocrine mediated adverse effects of ecological relevance. The development and international validation of endocrine specific testing procedures for the derivation of qualitative and mechanistic information (screening assays) as well as testing protocols for a quantitative assessment of endocrine mediated effects on apical endpoints (e.g. growth, reproduction, sexual development) are just underway (cf. OECD activities). Moreover, endocrine specific data requirements are not explicitly laid down in Directive 91/414/EEG and the respective national legislation, too. 4. This shortcomings cause serious concern whether endocrine mediated adverse effects in non-target organisms can be adequately assessed based on the standard data requirements according to Directive 91/414/EEG. This uncertainty is especial ly critical for those groups of organism where only limited knowledge about the significance and functioning of endocrine systems is at hand and/or for which adequate testing protocols are not existing (terrestrial and aquatic arthropods, terrestrial and aquatic mollusks, amphibian, birds). 5. As a consequence, an all-encompassing and systematic endocrine specific assessment of plant protection products and their active ingredients is not feasible today, and supposedly will be not in the near future, too. Extrapolation from toxicological and clinical data derived for human health risk assessment is also of restricted relevance when assessing endocrine effects in other non-target organisms. 6. Therefore, the assessment of endocrine mediated effects within the national authorization procedure for plant protection products is case-by-case and based on a weight-of-evidence approach, respectively. If there is any indication for an endocrine disrupting potential of a particular substance (e.g. from toxicological data provided by a notifier or the open scientific literature), all available information are evaluated by UBA regarding their reproducibility, plausibility, significance and relevance. If the endocrine potential of the particular substance is established by weight-of-evidence and there is concern about non-acceptable harm to populations ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 76 of non-target organisms, the agency is asking the notifier for additional information. The information requested must be adequate to reliably derive thresholds of no-concern and regulatory acceptable concentrations, respectively for endocrine mediated adverse effects of ecological relevance. This may necessitate the notifier to conduct an endocrine specific non-standard study (e.g. with aquatic mollusks). 7. The development of endocrine-specific testing and assessment today is - on both national and international level - most advanced for fish. In December 2007 a workshop took place entitled Characterization of endocrine mediated effects in fish\" (translation from German). Experts from Germany representing industry, regulatory authorities and academia agreed on the basic design of an (national) testing and assessment strategy for endocrine effects in fish. The workshop protocol was just recently made available to the public (Sorry, accompanying paper in German language only. An English publication is underway.). However, further work is necessary for consolidation and refinement of the agreed strategy. For this reason, the implementation into national legislation is not realizable to date. 8. If high-quality data suitable for a quantitative ecological risk assessment for the potentially affected non-target organisms are at hand for a specific plant protection product or the active ingredient(s) identified to be an endocrine disrupter, the standard assessment factors according to Directive 91/414/EEG are appropriate for the risk assessment. Moreover, all risk mitigation measures generally available in Germany may be taken into account in such cases, too. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 77 Attachment 2 Expert Report Assessment of the safety of an extrapolation from growth data of Early Life Stage- and Juvenile Growth Tests (OECD 210, 204, 215) to the NOEC of Fish Full Life Cycle Tests in the risk assessment of DMI-fungicides Christoph Sch\u00e4fers Translation by Hans Schmallenberg-Grafschaft Schmallenberg, October 10, 2007 ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 78 1. Introduction Active ingredients of plant protection products of th e demethylase-inhibitor (DMI)-fungicide group show a potential for endocrine disruption based on the intended effect mechanism (inhibition of the ergosterol- biosynthesis in target fungus), because the inhibite d target enzyme is a cytochrome P-450 enzyme showing a high structure analogy to aromatase among others. Aromatase is a central enzyme of the steroid-biosynthesis in vertebrates and molluscs, which converts testosterone to 17-beta-estradiol, thus playing a determining role in the sex regulation and the expression of sexual physiological characteristics. The assumption that these substances may have an effect on the endocrine system of vertebrates was confirmed in long-term studies on mammals, birds and fish for several representatives of this group. For this reason, the German Registration Authorities regards all representatives of the DMI fungicide group as potential endocrine disruptors. Until this \"initial suspicion\" is addressed over the expected environmental concentration range using suitable studies, registrations have been blocked. During the last discussions between the authorities and IVA, it was agr eed that, under certain conditions registrations may continue until appropriate data have been submitted and reviewed, e.g. Full Life Cycle Test (FLCT). For this purpose, it is necessary to determine a criterion to allow for an interim registration. Therefore a suitable extrapolation factor is under discussion allowing the extrapolation of a FLCT NOEC from existing fish chronic studies (ELS etc). Considering such a factor would allow a preliminary assessment of the acceptable risk and take into account all relevant risk mitigation measures (minimum distance requirements). In an assessment by the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA), a factor of 5 was proposed. The robustness of this extrapolation factor shall be evaluated by the Fraunhofer IME as neutral instance based on all available data, and a modified factor shall be proposed, if sensible. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 79 2. Available data and definition of task UBA confidentially provided study reports of FLCTs that had already been assessed. Furthermore, company data were collected on a confidential basis consisting of data on acute and chronic fish toxicity (OECD 203, 204, 210, 215), on potential endocrine effect s (Fish Screening Assay (FSA); Fish Sexual Development Test (FSDT)) and on the bioconcentrat ion potential (OECD 305), besides FLCT-data. In addition, companies provided a literature evaluation on aromatase inhibition of various DMI-fungicides. The aim was to compare available endpoints from different studies for a large number of DMI-fungicides with as far as possible different physico-chemical prope rties and potencies, to ensure that the discussed extrapolation factor would cover a broad range of properties. In particular, the available fish studies were evaluated to: 1. identify the sensitive endpoints in the FLCT and to: - show the ratios between the sensitive population relevant endpoints (e.g. sex ratio, growth, reproduction) and the ratios to the indicative biomarker endpoints, such as secondary sex characteristics or vitellogenin (VTG), - discuss the robustness of different endpoints for endocrine mediated risks. 2. to compare the sensitive FLCT-data (cf. 1) with Early Life Stage- (ELS), Juvenile Growth- (JG), FSA- and FSDT-data in order to: - clarify, which factor would be sufficiently safe from a regulatory perspective to extrapolate from the NOEC of an ELS- or JG-test to the NOEC of a FLCT. 3. assess the influence of the tested fish species on the respective finding (cf. points 1 and 2). Trends are shown for endpoint specific differences and common features in sensitivity. 4. compare these data with the most sensitive ones of the other relevant ecotoxicological data (e.g. algae) to clarify, if the observed endocrine mediated effects are ultimately relevant in the risk assessment. Options, limits and minimal requirements to extrapolate to copounds with less information are evaluated. In addition to assessing the safety of the extrapolat ion factor applied to ELSNOECs in order to decide on the required studies concomitant to the authorization, further information is derived that could contribute to the development of a definitive test strategy for DMI-fungicides. Relations between sensitivities in in-vitro tests and FLCTs as well as between sensitivities and compound properties, like bioconcentration, are established in order to provide contributions to a clearer mechanistic overall picture and to increase the safety of future regulatory decisions. Whether a FSA can be a safe trigger or range-finder for a FLCT, or whether a FSDT can be a sufficient alternative to the FLCT for a given mode of action (MoA), cannot clearly be answered based on the data base available for this investigation. 3. Data handling For the compilation of the data in the following figu res, NOEC- and ECx-values of the various reported. FLCT data and some strongly deviating NOECs from ELS - or JG-tests were evaluated in detail. Not only the statistical significance, but also the dose-response relationship has been considered, as the evaluation was targeted towards a comparative evaluation of endpoint sensitivity and not towards a regulatory risk assessment. Where a reevaluation by UBA or the company existed, the more conservative value was used. In the following, figures are presented without the names of the substance. If substances have been ranked, this was done with decreasing sensitivity of the relevant endpoints. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 80 4. Results 4.1 Comparison of sensitive endpoints in the FLCT Data for 16 substances were submitted. Nine FLCT for 7 substances were considered. One study was excluded as there were too many uncertainties about the reliability of the NOECs. To compare intrinsic toxicities, time weighted average (TWA) concentrations were used for the studied life phase of the static FLCT with sediment. In all tests, reproduction and growth were assessed. Where data on sex ratio were missing, these were either assessed from the raw data (partly only stated as no evidence of...\"), or from a separate FSDT. Sex ratio was the most sensitive endpoint in 4 tests, growth in 3, and reproduction in 2 tests (Fig. 1). In both tests with reproduction as the most sensitive endpoint (different fish species), sex ratio has not been assessed directly. However, the NOEC for sex ratio determined at a later stage based on the raw data is identical to the NOEC for growth. The sensitivity of the population relevant endpoints sex ratio, growth and reproduction is essentially comparable; the differences in sensitivity of signific ant effects were within on e concentration step in 6 out of 9 tests for all 3 endpoints. Figure 1: Comparison of the sensitivity of the NOECs of various population relevant endpoints in Fish Full Life Cycle Tests. Ranking of the tests (1-9) by the degree of sensitivity Assessment of the Safety of an extrapolation from growth data of Early Life Stage- and Juvenile Growth Tests to Fish Full Life Cycle Tests of DMI-fungicides There are 3 exceptions: I n a s t a t i c s t u d y w i t h s e d i m e n t ( N r . 4 ) t o a s s e s s effects on different life stages after an initial peak exposure, the sex ratio was 5 times more sensitive than growth and 6 times more sensitive than reproduction. This ranking of sex ratio > growth > reproduction reflects the sustainability of effects set by a peak exposure, because with decreasing concentrations, the endpoint reproduction recovers first (because of the duration of involved physiological processes), followed by growth. A recovery of sex reversal, once induced, seems not possible in the studied species. In so far, these results don't contradict the situation in the 6 studies above; for a comparison of the intrinsic toxicities, only the sex ratio should be used. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 81 In study 1, the sex ratio in the controls was strongly biased towards females, while there were normal sex ratios in the test item concentrations and no concentration-responserelationship was visible. Effects on the control regarding growth and reproduction cannot be excluded. In so far, the study should be treated with caution. In study 6, reproduction was 8 times more sensitive than growth and sex ratio. A closer look at the study revealed that the low reproduction rate at the higher test concentrations did not allow a replication of the F1 and hence no statistical evaluation was possible. Consequently, the growth NOEC is only based on the adult F0; the study was not designed to evaluate sex ratio anyhow. For this reason, the differences in sensitivity of the endpoints appear less meaningful. The indicative endpoint VTG was only assessed in 3 studies, and its sensitivity always corresponded to the sex ratio, the most sensitive population relevant parameter. For another substance, a literature reference was considered, in which the VTG decrease was as sensitive as sex ratio, but 2 times less sensitive than the most sensitive endpoint growth. Overall, the FLCT data set is weak with regard to the determination of the sex ratio. A determination of VTG is not important for the determination of a decisive regulatory NOEC, but would be helpful for the identification of the relevant toxicological MoA. 4.2 Comparison of NOECs from FLCT with ELS- and JG-tests For all 16 substances, there are ELS studies (OECD 210) and/or growth data from prolonged fish or JG- tests available (OECD 204, OECD 215; not distingu ished as JG any longer in the following). A comparison of these NOECs with those of existing FLCTs for the 7 substances should elucidate, whether the extrapolation to the NOEC of the FLCT by the application of a factor of 5 would have been sufficiently safe for a regulatory decision. Figure 2: NOEC-data for growth from ELS- and JG-tests. Ranking of the substances (1-9) according to sensitivity. For 8 substances, growth-NOECs were determined in ELS- and prolonged- or JG-tests. In 6 cases, the results were almost similar (Fig. 2) and allow the conclusion that for the given MoA, both test methods are equivalent (with respect to the endpoint growth) fo r the derivation of a regulatory NOEC. In the 2 ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 82 remaining cases (substance 1, 8 and 10 in Fig. 2), the JG-test was remarkably less sensitive. Both cases represent older studies, in which the growth data were assessed in a 28 days OECD 204-test with rainbow trout. No information is given about the initial size and the increase in fish size, only the size at the end of exposure was compared resulting in no effect up to the NOEC in regard to lethal effects. These tests are not regarded as an adequate alternative to the OECD 215- or OECD 210-tests. Figure 3: Most sensitive NOECs from ELS- or JG-tests in comparison to the lowest endpoints of valid FLCTs- and the acute toxicity data. Ranking of substances according to the sensitivity in ELS/JG-tests. It is remarkable that the acute toxicities of the 16 substances studied are less scattered (1.5 orders of magnitude) than the chronic effects (3 orders of magnitude; Fig. 3). This means that the substances under investigation have very different acute to chronic ratios (ACR). In the context of substance regulation for unspecific acting substances, an extrapolation from the acute LC50 to the chronic NOEC by one order of magnitude is applied. A high ACR suggests a wide span between the sensitivity of the chronic endpoint and the general basal toxicity, and indicates a specific MoA. For the most sensitive substances 1-10, the ACRs are in the range of 125 to 760 (exception: substance 8 with 25) indicating a clear specific effect on fish, while for the substances 11-16, the ACR are never higher than 100, and in 5 cases even lower than 10. In this segment of the sequence, unspecific basal to xicity may possibly be expected in the concentration range of chronic effects. The comparison of the most sensitive population rele vant NOECs from FLCTs and the NOECs from ELS- and JG-tests show that for all substances in the more sensitive half of the sequence, the ELS/JG-NOEC is lower than or identical to the FLCT-NOEC. For substa nces with higher NOECs, there are less FLCT-data. Here is the only value with a higher sensitivity of the FLCT-NOEC: substance 14 with a factor of 5.1 has the only critical value (in regard to the aim of the present evaluation). A closer examination of the test results gave no indication of irregularities. However, it should be considered that the ACR is only 4 in relation to the ELS and about 20 to the FLCT. Because the most sensitive endpoint in the FLCT is growth, a more general MoA than aromatase inhibition might be the cause. In order to assess the safety of the extrapolation from ELS- or JG-NOECs to FLCT-NOECs, however, it is not sufficient to base it on the lowest value of the growth data only. The extrapolation should be possible with high statistical safety from each submitted ELS- or JGtest. For the present evaluation, all available NOECs from ELS- or JG-tests of the 7 substances with valid FLCTs were related to the most sensitive NOECs from FLCTs (Table 1). For substance 14 discussed above, it gets clear that the ratios for the ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 83 maximum and minimum values (11,5 and 5,1) both lie outside the 99,9%-confidence limit of the mean and therefore represent a special case also statistically . Even for this substance, the upper 99,9%-confidence limit still lies within the discussed factor of 5. Without this substance, a factor of 3 would be possible; although the extreme value which is based on a reliable study lies between 4 and 5. Table 1: Statistics of all NOEC-ratios of ELS- or JG-Tests in relation to FLCTs NOEC ELS or JG / NOEC FLCT NOEC ELS or JG / NOEC FLCT All seven substances Without substance Number of comparisons 16 14 Mean 2,2 1,4 Standard deviation of the population mean 11,5 4,6 Minimum of 2,12 99% confidence limit of mean 4,1 2,3 Upper 99,9% confidence limit of mean 4,6 2,5 Based on the data available so far, a factor of 5 applied to the most sensitive NOEC of ELS- or JG- tests is protective for a preliminary extrapolation to the NOEC of a FLCT. Especially for substances with a clear dominance of endocrine mediated effects, there is a high safety in this respect. Because a FLCT is regarded as the only test that covers all potential MoAs, the necessity to run such a test increases with increasing ACR. For the present MoA, the safety of the estimate seems to increase also by the use of the endpoint \"juvenile growth\". If the MoA aromatase inhibition\" is clearly dominant, it should be discussed whether the final risk assessment without the availability of an FLCT can be performed by applying an additional safety factor on a suitable growth-NOEC. If required by the submitter, the necessary risk mitigation measures might probably be reduced by submitting a higher-tier test (FLCT), provided the test results do allow this. 4.3 Comparison of NOECs from FLCT with FSA- and FSDT-data Fish Screening Assays (FSA, on the verge of implementation as OECD test method) are performed to confirm a suspicion derived from preliminary informat ion (MoA, toxicology, in vitro data) by an in vivo test. If this is the case, further test-tiers shall elucidate the potential for population relevant effects. This implies that the FSA allows to exit the test scheme in case of negative results. Therefore, false negative results should be excluded in view of the precautionary principle. From the viewpoint of risk assessment, it is also not desirable to have a too strong sensitivity (false positives); the FSA must have a predictive potential for effects in the FLCT. This can be elucidated by an effect specific comparison of the sensitivities between FSA and FLCT. Fish Sexual Development Tests (FSDT, at the time in the validation process of the OECD) are extended ELS-tests that expose the fish until sex development is completed, assessing sex ratio, histological endpoints and mostly also VTG, apart from the ELS endpoints. The feasibility of such tests in the risk assessment of endocrine active substances is being discussed controversially. The author regards the FSDT as not suitable for an intermediate tier between FSA and FLCT, because on the one hand it does not ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 84 contain the essential population relevant endpoints (e.g. reproduction), therefore, it is not sensitive and cannot trigger a FLCT on the other hand it covers the most sensitive phase (e.g. sexual development) as part of the FLCT and can, therefore, replace a FLCT. There remains only to be discussed whether the shortened test method in comparison to the FLCT can be used as a final-tier test or not. Up to now the data base is not sufficient to allow a solid comparison of the most sensitive endpoints from FLCTs with those of FSAs (partly with reproduction endpoints) or FSDTs. Only for 4 substances there is information on endocrine mediated effects from these specific tests. For 3 substances, VTG was assessed, sex ratio for 2 and reproduction for one substance. For 3 additional substances there exist FSA-results, but no FLCT-data. All NOECs or EC10s for VTG were within a factor of 2 to the NOECs of the sex ratio from FLCTs and matched the VTG-NOECs from FLCT, where available. Reproduction was included in one case yielding an identical NOEC consistent with the respective FL CT-NOEC (177 \u00b5g/L versus > 85 \u00b5g/L). In one FSDT, the NOEC of the sex ratio was the most sensitive endpoint as was the NOEC of the VTG. For another substance, the sex ratio had not been assessed in the FLCT. The FSDT resulted in a similar NOEC as the population relevant endpoints in the FLCT, but additionally it provided a remarkably more sensitive histological NOEC based on liver toxicity. This value was more sensitive than the FLCT-data, but close to the lowest NOEC for growth derived from ELS/JG-studies. Overall, it can be concluded that the existing FSA- and FSDT-data do not provide any evidence that they would not be predictive for a FLCT (FSA) or that they would not deliver equally sensitive results (FSDT). An extension of the data base is desirable. An exact comparison of FSA- and FLCT-data is not possible because FSAs normally were performed with only 3 concentrations using a wider spacing, and no NOEC or ECx was determined. It is regrettable that the classification of the FSA as a pure screening test makes it difficult for this type of test to generate data useful for the purpose of a risk assessment. Provided that sufficient sensitivity of the FSA can be confirmed, it s hould be discussed if the FSA can be used to either trigger a further test (which in the opinion of the author would represent the final tier) or to exit the testing scheme. The exit criterion could be the determination of a NOEC in the concentration range of e.g. 10 times below the acute LC50. 4.4 Comparison of different fish species Acute Tests If the substances are ranked according to their sensitivity in the ELS/JG-test, then rainbow trout is always the most sensitive species for the substances in the more sensitive half of the ranking. In the less sensitive half, it was 3 times the trout, 3 times the bluegill, once the golden orfe and once the sheepshead minnow. ELS/JG-Tests In the prolonged fish- or JG-tests, rainbow trout was us ed exclusively. ELS-tests were conducted with trout (7x) or fathead minnow (7x). There is one ELS-tes t with the sheepshead mi nnow, which showed only a slightly lower sensitivity than the trout for the same substance and test. FLCT Of the 9 FLCTs, four were conducted using fathead minnow, 3 using zebrafish, and 2 sheepshead minnow. Only for 2 substances, there are comparable data for fathead minnow and zebrafish basically indicating comparable sensitivity for both species. It seems that there is a difference in the expression of the effects between zebrafish and fathead minnow due to the sex development mechanism of zebrafish (conversion of the protogyn gonad in developing males, probably triggered by the ratio of the hormone titer). Zebrafish therefore react more sensitive to an aromatase inhibition than fathead minnow, and fathead evidently appears to dispose of a higher compensation potential for counter regulation. In turn fathead minnow, because of its bigger absolute growth potential, allows a higher accuracy of statistical discrimination of growth efects. This again applies for zebrafish in regard to reproduction parameters, due to its more homogeneous and proliferous egg production. These conclusions are based on test and assessment ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 85 experience of many years, but cannot be drawn from the limited number of studies in this evaluation. However, they don't contradict the findings of the present data. Most FLCTs with fathead minnow were performed in the US and represent older data, performed without endocrine focus. Therefore, a comparison is difficult. Because of the nature of the MoA under discussion, it appears that all population relevant endpoints are of comparable sensitivity. Therefore, no recommendation regarding the potential sensitivity of the species can be deduced. Practicability, effort and usability for modified test protocols are to be discussed elsewhere. The author does not regard himself as neutral in this respect. 4.5 Consideration of aromatase inhibition activity and BCF Due to its conservative evolution, the structure of the steroid biosynthesis enzymes can be regarded as being relatively similar within vertebrates. For this reason, the most sensitive (molar) population relevant data from FLCTs were plotted against the IC50 of hum an aromatase (Tr\u00f6sken et al., 2004) to elucidate the mechanistic background of the effects. In one case, the missing IC50-data could be estimated roughly from other published data. A significant correlation between the IC50 of human aromatase and relevant endpoints for fish populations is resulting (r=0.858; p<0.05), if the substance with the most sensitive aromatase inhibition is regarded as an outlier (Fig. 4). Because this substance has been described as being very potent also in rainbow trout microsoms, its relativ ely insensitive endocrine effect in the chronic fish test must be due to other reasons. Because the effects of a substance not only depend on its affinity towards the target but also on its availability, the lowest NOECs of endocrine mediated effects in long-term fish studies were plotted against the BCFs from studies according to OECD 305 (Fig. 5). The relation between high bioconcentration and sensitive effect is not significant, even if the substance discussed in the last paragraph is regarded as an outlier (a particularly high BCF with only medium effect). Figure 4: Lowest NOECs from Fish Fu ll Life Cycle Tests compared to the inhibition of human aromatase. Open rhombus: Potential outlier. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 86 Figure 5: Lowest NOECs from Fish Full Life Cycle Tests compared to BCF from OECD 305 studies. Open rhombi: BCF only determined for total radioactivity The possible reason for the weak correlation between BCF and NOEC may be due the fact that the BCF of 5 out of 7 substances was only given as total radioactivity. The true BCFvalue is lower, as the total radioactivity also includes all the breakdown products. Depending on the depuration rate in fish, the reduction of the BCF is substance-specific, resulting from the relation of uptake and depuration rate, which cannot be determined, if only the total radioactivity is given. This caveat applies also to the relation between NOECs of endocrine effects in fish long-term tests and the rectified accounting of the BCF and IC50 (Fig. 6). Between the highest and lowest NOEC be longing to the two true\" BCFs, the NOECs are in a clear dependency to the calculation factor particularly due to the aromatase inhibition, again with the exception of the outlier mentioned in the two previous chapters. Figure 6: Lowest NOECs from endocrine l ong-term tests with fish compared to the product of BCF and 1/IC50 aromatase inhibition. Open rhombi : BCF only determined for total radioactivity. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 87 4.6 Comparison with other relevant ecotoxicological endpoints A comparison with the other most sensitive ecotoxicological endpoints relevant for the assessment (algae, Daphnia, Lemna, Chironomus) should clarify, whether the observed endocrine mediated effects in fish are relevant for the regulatory effect assessment. For this purpose, data were provided for 11 of 16 substances (Fig. 7). Figure 7: Most sensitive regulative endpoints for the a ssessment of the chronic toxicity in aquatic organisms. Ranking of the substances (1-11) according to the sensitivity in the fish test. Chironomus endpoints always less sensitive than fish endpoints, therefore not indicated. For this MoA, no characteristic regularity of the relation between chronic fish toxicity and chronic endpoints for other aquatic organisms is apparent. If the different sensitivities of the fish NOECs of the individual substances are taken into account (Fig. 8) , it gets obvious that with NOECs higher than 100 \u00b5g/L, other endpoints clearly react more sensitive and thus the effects on fish are less relevant for the assessment. In the range 10 to 100 \u00b5g/L, in most cases a NOEC of another aquatic organism with comparable sensitivity exists. In this situation, the fish NOEC may represent the critical value due to the long generation time of fish and its reproductive potential to recover. Both fish NOECs, which are clearly more sensitive than all other aquatic endpoints, are lower than 15 \u00b5g/L. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 88 Figure 8: Factor of sensitivity between the most sens itive chronic NOECs from fish tests and those from tests with other aquatic organisms. 4.7 Recommendation for data requirements to a ssess the risk of DMI-fungicides to fish Preliminary risk assessment to clarify if the definitive risk assessment can be done as a post registration requirement Based on the available data, an extrapolation applying a factor of 1/5 to the NOECs of ELSor JG-data is sufficiently safe to estimate the NOEC of a FLCT fo r effects caused by aromatase inhibition. In the future, it should be granted that growth data are elaborated in prolonged fish test according to OECD 215. Definitive risk assessment A FLCT is still necessary for DMI-fungicides as final-tier test method, because different endpoints were identified as most sensitive ones in the available FLCT. An extrapolation from growth-NOECs to the NOECs of the final-tier tests by adding an additional safety factor is to be discussed. Indicative endpoints (e.g. VTG or hormone titer) may explain the mode of act ion and thus may be helpful to the reduction of the uncertainty of the regulation, but are not needed for the purpose of the deduction of the decisive NOECs for the regulation. The evidently close correlations between the endpoint sensitivities should allow to replace the FLCT by the FSDT in the mid-term, provided future studies will confirm the comparable sensitivity of data derived from FSDT. To decide whether it will be possib le in the future to assess the risk based on IC50- and BCF-data would require a re-assessment of the BCFs based on the parent compound.

The advisory body Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) established the Endocrine Disruptive Effect Subcommittee, an advisory body of the Minister, un der the Chemical Substances Council in 1999. The Subcommittee consists of specialists of biology, ecology, medical science and pharmacology, and has been held three or four times a year. In 2000, the Subcommittee publicized an interim report which collects information to develop testing methods of endocrine disrupting properties as well as existing data of chemical substances which had been concerned as substances having endocrine disrupting properties. In 2002, the Subcommittee addressed assessment result of hazard information on fifteen priority chemical substances. In 2006, the Subcommittee publicized an interim report on hazard assessment on human health effect of endocrine disrupters and action plan for future researches and studies. 2. Researches and studies METI, along with Chemicals Evaluation and Research In stitute (CERI), has started researches and studies regarding human health effect of endocrine disrupters since 2000. In early stage of the studies, hazard assessment was conducted to fifteen chemical substances which had been concerned as substances having endocrine disrupting properties, and it was concluded in above Subcommittee that no significant risk to human health was fund at Japan's present situation. METI has shifted main target of studies to contribution to the OECD Test Guideline Programme and has been conducting non animal and animal testing as below under the technical advice of the Subcommittee.

The advisory committee The Advisory Committee on Health Effects of Endocrine disruptive chemicals has been established since 1998. The committee is a private panel under the Director-General of the Pharmaceutical and Food Safety Bureau in the Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare (MHLW). The committee has consisted of epidemiologist, toxicologist, analyst, members of consumer representative and so force. Since 1998, the committee has been held 20 sessions with open to the public. The committee has compiled and published the interim report (1998), the 1st supplemental report of the interim report (2002) and the 2nd supplemental report of the interim report (2005). The committee addresses evaluation of risk of endocrine disrupters toward human health, necessity of prompt action to protect public health, risk communication with the general public and so force. The committee has mapped out the action plan regularly. The first action plan was established in 2002, and the second one was established in 2005. Various researches and studies have been conducted in accordance with these plans. The committee has described the framework of testing scheme on possible chemicals as endocrine disrupters. The framework consists two parts; one is in silico , in vitro and in vivo assay, the other is definitive test. The committee has drawn up the list of chemicals according to the prioritized by the result of the former part. To improve risk communication, MHLW has established the web site regarding endocrine disrupter chemicals in cooperate with the committee. In this homepage, MHLW has prepared FAQs, explanation about the committee's discussion and various statements submitted by the committee. 2. Researches and studies MHLW has provided Health and Labour Sciences Research Grants. Since 1996, MHLW has started new study field concerning health effect on human of e ndocrine disrupters. In this new study field, study regarding epidemiological research, exposure and effects of endocrine disrupters to the human body and test method to detect endocrine disruptors have been implemented. MHLW has also conducted screening test projects as a contracted research entrusted with National Institute of Health Sciences. In the project, Hershberger Bioassay and rodent Uterotrophic Bioassay has been conducted. MHLW has conducted these in vivo assays in order of priority by the result of in silico and in vitro assay. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 92 Ministry of the Environment 1. The advisory body (1) History The Japan Environment Agency (former Ministry of the Environment (MOE) (since 2000)) established \"The Exogenous Endocrine Disrupting Chemical Working Group\" to discuss the endocrine disrupting effects in the environment in March 1997. The WG was consisted with experts of biology, ecolo gy, medical science and pharmacology. This WG released an interim report in July 1997. MOE published the \"Strategic Programs on Environmental Endocrine Di sruptors98\" (SPEED '98.) in May 1998, based on the report from WG. For the further scientific discussion and implementation of SPEED '98, the \"Commission on Endocrine Disruptors\" was established in June 1998. MOE established a SPEED '98 Revision Working Group in 2003, composed of specialists, experts in the field, and representatives from consumer groups etc. This revision WG held meetings for two years.

Introduction 1-1. Background Ever since the endocrine disruptors (EDs) loomed large as an international issue in the late 1990s, the relevant government ministries including the Ministry of Environment has established \"Mid/Long Term Research Plan on Endocrine Disruptors\" and each ministry has conducted various research projects thereafter. Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs (marine ecosystem), Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (risk assessment & management, animal drugs, livestock products, seafood) Ministry of Environment (air, water, sediments, soil, biota etc.), Rural Development Administration (agricultural pesticides & farmland), Korea Food and Drug Administration (food and drug etc.) Projects have been promoted primarily focusing on the monitoring of endocrine disruptors in various environmental media due to the ambiguity of endocrine disruption and the international delay in the preparation of test guidelines on endocrine disruptors, and thus, there are limitations in the policy application. In particular, the individual \"Mid/Long Term Research Plan on Endocrine Disruptors\" among relevant ministries was insufficient in sharing research results and promoting joint research projects. As the various projects progressed on, the necessity for the revised plan that reflects the research achievement on endocrine disruptors as well as the necessity for the cooperation between the ministries was proposed. When the inter-ministerial conference held to discuss in details the cooperation plans among the relevant ministries, the ministries agreed to jointly revise 5-Year (2007-2011) Plan on Endocrine Disruptors (August 2005). Furthermore, considering the ambiguity of the effects of endocrine disruption and the international delay in the preparation of test guidelines on endocrine disruptors, it is necessary to review and revise the current mid-long term research plan of each ministry. Accordingly, the ministries made the next five y ear (2007~2011) research plan harmonized on endocrine disruptors by reviewing the results of research projects that have been conducted up to now. The plan will contribute to lead to the preparation of appropriate plans for the safety management of endocrine disruptors of each ministry. 2. Major Achievement of Mid-Long Term Research Projects 2-1. Field of Terrestrial Environment 2-1-1 Overall Summary The Ministry of Environment established \"Mid-Long Term Research Plan on Endocrine Disruptors\" in 1999 and has been promoting various research projects in accordance with this plan.

Conduct ecological effects on the pollution route and health effects of endocrine disruptors and figure out the exposure related variables. Select the hot spots for investigation based on the results of the monitoring on the terrestrial environment and conduct inter-ministerial joint monitoring that takes the food chain of organism species living in the wild into account. 3-1-2 Project Strategy Classification of research projects into Joint Research Projects and Independent Research Projects Joint research projects will be selected through the inter-ministerial policy committee and the research priority will be given to the substances of high public interest or the substances that has become social issues, and risk assessment will be conducted on these substances Search for the projects (Inquiry into Endocrine Disruption, Production and Supply of Joint Publicity Materials, Risk Assessment, etc.) among the detailed research projects that can benefit more from inter-ministry networking or joint project plans promote such projects as joint cooperation projects. As a strategic approach for the risk assessment of endocrine disruptors, divide the roles based on each ministry's area of work, and share information produced from research projects in risk assessment and management. Independent research projects will be conducted by establishing independent plans of each ministry. Preparation of Project Strategy Projects of 2007 were performed according to the research plans of each ministry and the details of the projects were discussed among the relevant ministries. Starting 2008, research projects shall be conducted more systematically through the selection of joint and independent projects based on the 5-Year Plan. Projects will be evaluated twice: self-evaluation by each ministry and evaluation on the achievements of inter-ministerial cooperation through the inter-ministry policy committee. The comprehensive evaluation of the ministries will be conducted once every three years through the policy committee and project results will be shared through workshops and symposiums. Researches on the clarification of ambiguity of endocrine disruption must carry out. The project strategy aims at the establishment of infra-structure for initial risk assessment and plans on advancing into the risk assessment and management by understanding the trends of international organizations such as OECD and the developed countries. On the specific chemicals that need risk assessment, the ministries such as Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs, Ministry of Environment, Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Korea Food and Drug Administration come together to agree on the comprehensive research project for carrying out the risk assessment on the whole process including exposure assessment and dose-response ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 102 relationship. The Ministry of Environment takes charge of inter-ministerial adjustment and arrangement on research details for the effective and efficient implementation of the project. Financial resource investment for the next five years (2007~2011) for the implementation actively secure the estimated budget according to the priorities in order to prevent the setback in the research plan from the reduction in research expenses. 3-1-3 Classification into Inter-Ministerial Collaboration Projects and Independent Projects Subjects such as risk assessment that can gain from the synergistic effects of inter-ministerial cooperation will be selected as the topics for joint projects and cooperative research (task force team formed if necessary) will be promoted. < Joint Projects & Independent Projects > Classification Details Research Subjects Joint Projects Selection of Joint Project through the Inter-Ministerial of Policy CommitteeAction Mechanism Risk Assessment, Education & Publicity Independent Projects Projects that are Suitable for the Responsibilities of Each Ministry but Avoids Duplication through Prior Consultation and Review Ministr y of Environment : air, water, soil, sediment, biota Ministry of Health and Welfares : food and drug Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs : marine ecosystem, etc. Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries : farmlands, livestock products, etc. Data sharing and strengthening of network system through the organization of relevant ministerial policy committee.

Inquiry into the mechanisms of endocrine disruption (Joint & Independent ) (Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs, Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Ministry of Environment,, Rural Developm ent Administration, and Korea Food and Drug Administration) Each ministry conducts independent projects, such as a research on action mechanism, according to the responsibilities of each ministry, and also conducts joint research by distributing screening tasks of suspected endocrine disruptors that have yet been assessed among the ministries based on the testing methods that have been internationally recognized up to now. Risk assessment research (Joint) (Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs, Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Mi nistry of Environment, Rural Development Administration, and Korea Food and Drug Administration) Ministries promote joint risk assessment research project based on the basic monitoring results of each ministry. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 104 International Cooperative Project (Joint & Independent) (Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs, Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Fo restry and Fisheries, Ministry of Environment, Rural Development Administration, and Ko rea Food and Drug Administration) Ministries will prepare joint cooperative plan for the areas that allow joint participation such as the participation in OECD Screening and testing method development, and the projects that will be performed independently by each ministry will remain independent. (e.g.. Korea-Japan Joint Research by the Ministry of Environment) Publicity and information sharing projects for the public ( Joint & Independent ) (Ministry of Environment, Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Rural Development Administration, Korea Food and Drug Administration) Publicity projects for the public will be conducted independently based on the work distribution among the ministries, and as for the joint projects, the ministries jointly will search for and carry out large-scale projects such as television program development and risk communication program development. Independent Projects Research on ecological effects will be conducted independently due to the differences in the living organisms (ex. Ministry of Environment \u00c6 inland fish species marine fish species Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries \u00c6 livestock products). Survey of emission source & toxicity reduction technology development Survey of emission source and the development of toxicity reduction technology on substances will be conducted independently since these projects will require specialized responsibilities of each ministry. Research on the environmental fate and transport Research on the fate and transport of endocrine disruptors in the environment will be conducted independently due to the differences in the interests and subjected media of each ministry. Research on analysis methods This type of research will be also conducted independently due to the difference in the media that are subjected to the research analysis.

Where the UK has strong suspicions about the endocrine disrupting activities of specific chemicals, our basic approach is to put them forward for a full risk assessment at the European level - so that where risks are identified, European-wide measures will be taken to control them. The UK has led such risk assessments for several chemicals that have featured prominently in discussions about endocrine disruption, including nonylphenol and bisphenol A. Human Health 2. The use of specific tests for endocrine disruption in the assessment of human health risks is quite different from that in the environmental arena. 3. For the assessment of the potential risks to human health, UK regulators do not generally recommend that specific tests are carried out for substances known or suspected to have endocrine disrupting potential. UK regulatory authorities require new chemicals to be tested using the standard toxicology test requirements established by the relevant UK or European authority for that class of chemical (i.e. high production volume chemical, pesticide, pharmaceutical, food additive etc). If standard toxicity tests reveal effects on an endocrine system, then the significance for human health would be assessed before a decision on approval or risk reduction measures is taken. Similarly, specific tests for endocrine disruption have not been used in the UK to assess whether chemical contaminants may have an endocrine disrupting effect, although this remains a possibility for the future. Specific tests for effects on the endocrine system may be useful for cl arifying a mechanism of an effect observed in a standard toxicology test. In practice, it is rare for the UK to commission toxicological testing of specific contaminants. Government research funds are limited and it is more likely for programmes of research on specific themes to be commissioned, rather than toxicity tests on specific chemicals. 4. The most likely use of specific tests for endocrine disruption is within industry, for screening of new candidate chemicals for endocrine testing effects prior to making a decision on whether to take them forward for standard toxicological testing. Plant Protection Products 5. Basically, the UK does not have a set procedure fo r testing for endocrine disrupting activity for chemicals in this category, but assessments conducted under Directive 91/414/EEC are based on information in the EU aquatic and terrestrial guidance documents SANCO/3268/2001 (rev 4) and SANCO/10329/2002 (rev2). 6. When considering a pesticide that has potential endocrine disrupting effects, the lead is usually provided by the mammalian toxicological assessment - that is, if the assessment for human health indicates that the active substance may have endocrine disrupting properties, then further ecotoxicological data may be requested. For example, when considering aquatic life we would consider requesting either a full fish life cycle study or a partial fish life cycle study. As regards other ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 115 areas - such as aquatic invertebrates, birds and terrestrial invertebrates - there is currently a lack of study protocols or guidelines to enable the potential to be determined appropriately. When interpreting any data that indicate a potential effect, it is necessary to consider the exposure profile; i.e. is the potential for endocrine disruption due to short or prolonged exposure? There is currently a lack of information on this and hence a precautionary approach tends to be taken that assumes that effects are the result of short exposures. Environmental Assessments 7. With regard to environmental assessments, the UK te nds to take a pragmatic approach to the testing of potential endocrine disrupting chemicals, so that non-standard data on endocrine effects are taken into account - if they can be credibly shown to link with an adverse health effect in an individual, which in turn may have a population level impact and as long as they appear to be scientifically reliable. For example, when setting draft EQSs for certain organophosphates recently under WFD Annex VIII, data on possible interference with fish olfactory membranes and consequent pheromonal triggering of sperm maturation were considered. Equally, experime ntal data on super-ovulating female gastropods were taken into consideration for the recent risk assessment of bisphenol-A, along with other data, though on a relative 'weight' basis. 8. The UK has tended to be wary of the direct use of biomarkers of endocrine disrupting activity, such as vitellogenin (VTG) induction and hormone imbalances, for risk assessment purposes because the mechanistic links with adverse health effects of population relevance have not yet been demonstrated. It is certainly the case, though, that some of these links are getting stronger 6 and this is an area of work of high priority. Similarly, for ovotestis in fish induced by endocrine disruption, there are data that provide evidence for a link with the production of gametes of poorer quality 7. 9. Whilst it would be unsound to claim that biomarkers of ED are now ready for critical use in risk assessment and as key evidence, they may be used in a supporting role (e.g. to validate apparent outliers); for example, if a fish life cycle test gave a very low NOEC which might otherwise be considered an outlier, VTG data showing effects at a similar concentration could be used as corroborative evidence when setting an EQS (or mo re strictly, in setting a PNEC). Additionally, biomarkers such as VTG can have animal welfare benefits in the sense of being used to guide test concentration selection and aid efficient test design8,9). 6 See, for example: Miller DH, to population-level effects: a LJ, Gutjahr-Gobell DB, and ).

In short, the UK supports the view expressed in VMG-eco, that the use of biomarkers in definitive apical tests (e.g. fish lifecycle tests) is likely to be desirable rather than compulsory - e.g. for use in the rare cases when a substance is being tested for ED-r elated hazards at Level 4 without knowledge of its mode of action from mammalian or in vitro studies. 11. However, where data are obtained from tests that have not been validated and internationally standardised, especially where there are difficulties in replicating the results, then disputes over interpretation can easily arise. This is a particular problem in assessments of potential endocrine disrupting chemicals, since there are as yet no EDC-sensitive OECD guidelines (apart from the mammalian uterotrophic assay), despite almost a decade of extensive effort including discussion, provision of extensive data sets, reports and even a series of directed studies to address standardisation issues. A fish life cycle test conducted to USEPA guidelines is the only occasion when we can be reasonably sure that endocrine effects will have been covered. For invertebrates, the only routinely used reproductive test is the Daphnia 21 day guideline, which is certainly not sensitive to several relevant modes of EDC action. 12. Such uncertainty creates costly difficulties for industry and regulators alike; the UK therefore fully supports the OECD in attempting to speed up the test validation process, on the basis of continuing sound science, and sees it as a high priority to work with partners to that end. One way forward may be to truncate the current validation criteria - for example, validation of fish life cycle tests might be limited to a single species and more use could be made of published data. There may also be no need to duplicate the validation of fecundity measurements if these have already been validated in partial lifecycle tests. 13. Further priorities for the UK are: a) ethical issues, such as the reduction of the numbers of fish tested via the efficient use of biomarkers, or the replacement of vertebrate test species by the use of mechanistically relevant alternative test species 10; b) to extend coverage to animal groups of intrinsic ecological and economic importance which currently lack suitable ED test s, such as molluscs (it being recognised that certain groups may initially require studies of fundamental physiology); and c) getting endpoints/tests accepted for EDCs with specific modes of action for the present guideline species.

ECETOC Technical Report number 102, 145 pp ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 117 Appendix 8 Contribution from the United States ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 118 Overview of U.S. EPA Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) For Contribution to OECD Case Study Document Final draft: Aug 14, 2008 I. Introduction In May 2008 a notice was sent from the OECD WNT - EDTA to the working group for a request for contributions for the development of a \"case study\" document that is expected to lead to a \"Report on Endocrine Disruptors Assessment in OECD Member Countries\". In response, the US EPA is submitting its contribution by providing an overview of its Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) which is a two-tiered system for screening and testing the potential interactions of pesticide and non-pesticide chemicals on the estrogen, androgen and thyroid (EAT) hormonal systems with application to human health, anim al wildlife and the environment. To address how the EPA expects to screen for potential endocrine disruptors, a discussion is presented herein with emphasis on the EDSP Tier-1 battery. Selective examples are presented to illustrate the potential to detect chemicals with estrogenic, androgenic and thyroidogenic activity. The in vitro and mammalian and non- mammalian in vivo screening assays were designed to cover agonistic and antagonistic effects involving the estrogen and androgen modes of action and respective steroidogenic pathways as well as the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroidal (HPT) axis. It will be emphasized how complimentary and corroborating evidence among assays within the Tier-1 battery can be used with a weight-of-evidence approach to determine whether or not a test chemical interacts with the endocrine system. If results from Tier 1 are positive, indicating a substance does exhibit the potential to interact with the E, A or T hormonal pathways, then more complex and definitive dose-response testing would likely be done in Tier 2 to further identify the po tential hazard and to assess adversity and risk to the public and the environment. II. Overview of EDSP A. Congressional mandate Passage of the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) in 1996 and subsequent amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and Federal Food, Dru g, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) required EPA to: develop a screening program, using appropriate validate d test systems and other scientifically relevant information, to determine whether certain substances may have an effect in humans that is similar to an effect produced by a naturally occurring estrogen, or other such endocrine effect as the Administrator may designate [21 U.S.C. 346a(p)]. In response to this mandate, the Agency established a multi-stakeholder federal advisory committee, the Endocrine Disruptor Screening and Testing Advisory Committee (EDSTAC) under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. App. 2, Sect ion 9(c). This committee was asked to provide advice to the Agency on how to design a screening and testing program for endocrine disrupting chemicals. In 1998, the EDSTAC published their final report, whic h included three fundamental recommendations as summarized below: 1) Expand the evaluation of additional modes of action beyond estrogen disruption to include test systems that detect androgen and thyroid disruption vi a the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroidal (HPT) axes. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 119 2) Expand the target population beyond humans to include animal wildlife. 3) Incorporate a two-tiered approach whereby Tier 1 would consist of a suite of complementary assays designed to be run together as a battery to effectively and efficiently screen substances for interactions with the estrogen, androgen and thyroid (EAT) hormonal systems. If, by weight-of-evidence, the results from the Tier-1 battery indicate that a test substance does exhibit the potential to interact with the E, A or T hormonal systems, then additional te sting would be required in Tier 2 with more comprehensive assays to further identify the potential hazard and assess risk through dose-response relationships. The EPA considered the recommendations from EDST AC, adopted the two-tiered testing strategy, and expanded the EDSP to include the androgen and thyroi d hormonal systems, as well as animal wildlife as reviewed in detail at the EDSP website: http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/oscpendo/ B. Assay validation The fundamental basis for assay validation is to es tablish relevance and reliability. In the context of the EDSP Tier-1 screening battery, relevance is the ability of an assay or endpoints within an assay to detect chemicals with the potential to interact with one or more of the EAT hormonal systems, whereas reliability is the reproducibility of those results within and between or among laboratories. Throughout the validation process of individual assays and in accord with the FACA, the EDSP sought guidance (e.g., protocol development, selection of known positive and negative test chemicals, and interpretation of results) from within the EPA (Office of Research and Development, ORD) and federal advisory committees such as the Endocrine Disrupter Meth ods Committee (EDMVAC) and FIFRA SAP from 2001 through 2007 that were open to the public for comment. The EPA has followed a five-stage assay validation pr ocess that included: 1) Test development, 2) Pre- validation, 3) Inter-laboratory validation, 4) Peer review and 5) regulatory acceptance as reviewed in detail at the EDSP website. http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/oscpendo/pubs/assayvalidation/status.htm C. Basis for assay selection for the Tier 1 screening battery The screening battery was designed to work as a whole. The basis for selecting a candidate assay to include in the battery involved: 1) the capacity of th at assay to detect estrogenic- and androgenic-mediated effects by various modes of action including receptor binding (agonist and antagonist) and activation/transcription, reproductive steroidogenesis, and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) feedback, and 2) the degree that in vitro and in vivo assays complemented one another in the battery as summarized in Table 1 below. In addition, rodent and amphibian in vivo assays were selected for the proposed battery based on their capacity to detect direct and indirect effects on thyroid function (hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroidal, HPT, feedback). Thus, the robustness of the proposed Tier-1 Screening Battery is based on the strengths of each individual assay and their complementary nature within the battery to detect effects on EAT hormonal function. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 120 Table 1: Suite of Assays in the EDSP Tier-1 Screening Battery In vitro Estrogen receptor (ER) binding - rat uterus or recombinant Estrogen receptor (hER ) transcriptional activation - Human cell line (HeLa-9903) Androgen receptor (AR) binding - rat prostate Steroidogenesis - Human cell line (H295R) Aromatase - Human recombinant In vivo Uterotrophic (rat) Hershberger (rat) Pubertal female (rat) Pubertal male (rat) Amphibian metamorphosis (frog) Fish short-term reproduction The endocrine modes of action and complimentary assays expected to detect effects on the E, A or T hormonal systems are indicated: 1) Estrogenicity or anti-estrogenicity - acting agonistically by potentiating or antagonistically by attenuating the estrogen signal as determined by the combined results of the in vitro estrogen receptor binding and transcriptional activation assays and in vivo pubertal - potentiating or antagonistically by attenuating the androgen signal as determined by the combined results of the in vitro androgen receptor binding assay and in vivo Hershberger, pubertal male and fish short-term reproduction assays. 3) Steroidogenic effects - altering steroidogenic processes by inducing or inhibiting enzymes involved in gonadal steroidogenesis as de termined by the combined results of the in vitro steroidogenesis and aromastase assays and in vivo pubertal female and and fish short-term reproduction assays. 4) Hypothalamic/pituitary/gonadal effects (HPG) - interference with the hypothalamic-pituitary regulation of gonadal steroidogenesis and gametogenesis as determined by the combined results of the in vivo pubertal female and male and fish short-term reproduction assays. 5) Hypothalamic/pituitary/thyroid effects (HPT) - altering processes directly involved in thyroid hormone receptor interactions and indirectly involved in thyroid function as determined by the combined results of in vivo pubertal female and male and amphibian metamorphosis assays. In vitro and in vivo assays are included in the Tier-1 screening battery to cover multiple modes of action and provide corroborating information among assays within the battery that will support a weight- of-evidence approach. The degree of complimentary actions among assays in the battery is summarized in Table 2. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 121 Table 2. Modes of Action and Degree of Complimentary Action among Assays in the EDSP Tier-1 Screening Battery. Battery Amphibian Metamorphosis Fish Short-term Reproduction (male & female) 1Estrogen and Androgen Receptor binding 2Estrogen and Androgen 3Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal or -thyroidal axis When all Tier-1 assays are performed and all assays are negative within the battery, it may be concluded that the test substance will not likely interact with EAT hormonal processes. If results from Tier 1 indicate that a substance does exhibit the potential to interact with E, A or T function, then more complex and definitive dose-response testing would be done in Tier 2. D. SAP peer review of EDSP Tier-1 screening battery EPA's Tier-1 battery was reviewed by the FIFRA SAP. The SAP was charged with commenting on whether the proposed battery composition of assays fulfills its purpose to identify the potential of a test chemical to interact with the E, A or T hormonal systems. The final SAP report to the Agency can be found at the SAP website http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/sap/meetings/2008/march/minutes2008-03-25.pdf . ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 122 The SAP discussed assays individually and as a battery and concluded: 1) Chemicals testing positive in the battery of Tier-1 assays would be identified as potential estrogenic, androgenic and thyroid hormone active substances. 2) The ability to identify endocrine active substances is enhanced in the Tier 1 battery because the tests provide adequate replication and redundancy. 3) It was clear that the inclusion of apical assays of amphibian metamorphosis and fish short-term reproduction were important to detect endocrine active substances that may operate by mechanisms of action yet to be discovered. 4) The 15-day adult male assay proposed during some public comments would not be an appropriate substitute for the male and female pubertal assays because the pubertal assays provide for differences between the sexes and provide the only approach to testing for organizational effects during development. Thus, the SAP found the proposed EDSP Tier-1 battery of assays in Table 1 adequate for screening chemicals to detect effects on the E, A or T hormonal systems. III. Dynamics of the EDSP Tier-1 Screening Battery A. Assays for detection of compounds that affect the estrogen signaling pathway The earliest concern for endocrine disruptors was related to environmental chemicals that could bind to the estrogen receptor and thereby interfere with the estrogenic signaling pathway. Hence, it was this concern that led to the statutory requirement in the FQPA to screen pesticide chemicals for estrogenic effects and is, therefore, the first mode of action that the EPA and EDSTAC considered in designing a battery for the EDSP. Estrogen is important for reproductive function in both males and females, including sexual differentiation of the brain and development of secondary female sex characteristics. In addition, estrogen is involved in the structural and functional development of other bodily systems across genders and for maintaining overall homeostasis. Five assays within the EDSP Tier-1 screening battery are capable of detecting whether or not a chemical affects estrogen receptor function. Together these assays are expected to detect chemicals with estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activity and include: 1) estrogen receptor (ER) binding, 2) ER transcriptional activation, 3) uterotrophic, 4) pubertal female, and 5) fish short-term reproduction assays. Of the five assays, the two in vitro assays (ER binding and transcriptional activation) identify the ability of the test chemical to interact with the estrogen receptor, thus providing mechanistic information about how the chemical interacts at the cellular level. The three in vivo assays provide confirmatory evidence for the effects of the chemical following in vivo exposure via subcutaneous injection, oral gavage, and aquatic medium, respectively. The uterotrophic assay has been shown to detect weak estrogens with subcutaneous treatment, while the female pubertal assay can detect both estrogen agonists and antagonists by examining the age at vaginal opening (VO) in addition to other estrogen-dependent endpoints. While many chemicals are active via the subcutaneous route, in some instances, oral exposure is more effective because of differences in absorption and metabolism. The different routes of exposure associated with the uterotrophic, female pubertal and fish short-term reproduction assays add robustness to the Tier-1 battery and may offer guidance when designing EDSP Tier-2 test s. Interpreting the results of the subset of estrogenic/anti-estrogenic assays within the battery is accomplished by examining the results of all the assays, as the sum of all of the datasets in a weight-o f-evidence approach is far greater than the information provided by any one assay alone. A brief description as well as the value of each of the five assays for detection of compounds that can potentially affect the estrogen signaling pathway is provided. In addition, examples with positive test chemicals involving the following assays and this MOA are presented in Section IV. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 123 1. ER Binding Assay The ER receptor binding assay utilizing rat uterine cytosol (RUC) is a rapid in vitro assay that measures the affinity of a test chemical to bind to the estrogen receptor (or ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor in the case of the human recombinant ER binding assays). It is a mechanistic assay that measures ligand-receptor interactions. It cannot distinguish between agonists, antagonists, or chemicals that have mixed agonist/antagonist activity or functional consequences of the interaction. Yet, the technical simplicity and high-throughput format are conducive for screening large numbers of chemicals. Thus, the assay is a valuable tool for identifying chemicals that can compete with endogenous estrogen for ER binding. The practical use of this assay and its relevance to in vivo effects is well documented in the scientific literature. The assay has been standardiz ed and examined with a number of positive and negative test compounds. Inter-laboratory validation of the ER binding assay will be completed and results submitted for peer review in late 2008. A protocol is expected to be available at the EDSP website in early 2009. 2. ER Transcriptional Activation Assay The ER transcriptional activation (ERTA) assay is a method to detect the interaction and response of a chemical on the estrogen receptor. ERTA assays are based upon the expression of a reporter gene induced by a chemical following the ligand-receptor binding and subsequent transcriptional activation. As part of the Endocrine Disruption Testing and Assessment Task Force activity under the OECD Test Guidelines Program, Chemicals Evaluation and Research Institute (CERI) of Japan developed and validated a stably transfected transactivation assay with ER using the hER-HeLa-9903 (HeLa) cell line. This assay complements the ER binding assay as it can identify ER agonists. Thus, this assay is included in the battery as a more contemporary and functional approach to detect ER agonists. 3. Uterotrophic Assay The uterotrophic assay is an in vivo assay that primarily evaluates the ability of a chemical to elicit uterine changes consistent with the effects of estrogen agonists. The assay is conducted using adult ovariectomized females but may be conducted with sexually immature intact female rats in which endogenous estrogens are minimal. An increase in uterine weight in response to estrogen-induced water imbibition and hypertrophy is the principle endpoint. By using a subcutaneous (sc) route of exposure, the uterotrophic assay contributes information on a specific estrogen-related biological response that precludes any first-pass liver metabolism. Thus, data from the uterotrophic assay can complement the in vitro ER assays where metabolic activity is either non-detectable (ER binding) or minimal (ERTA assay) or has first pass through the liver as in the in vivo female pubertal assay, which involves oral exposure. For example, chemicals that are estrogenic ( e.g., bisphenol A) would be positive in the ER binding, ERTA, and uterotrophic assays, whereas chemicals that need to be metabolized in order to be estrogenic ( e.g., methoxychlor) may be weak or likely missed in ER binding, ERTA and uterotrophic assays, but positive in the female 4. Pubertal Female Assay The pubertal female assay an in vivo assay that is sensitive to estrogens and anti-estrogens. It is the only bioaassay currently validated that can detect estrogen receptor agonists. For example, chemicals with estrogenic activity (e.g., methoxychlor, nonylphenol, and octylphenol) hasten the age of vaginal opening (VO) and onset of puberty. When tamoxifen a selec tive estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with mixed agonist/antagonist activity was examined, VO was hastened in response to the tamoxifen-induced estrogenic effects which was substantiated by increased organ weight changes of the uterus and vagina. Estrogenic effects also accelerate the age at first estrus and can induce vaginal cornification. Although ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 124 there is a paucity of data describing the effects of known anti-estrogenic compounds in the pubertal female assay because few, if any, environmental anti-estrogens have been identified, the presumptive response to an anti-estrogen would be a delay in VO and onset of puberty. Since the age of VO can also be delayed by an effect on the HPG-axis, change in the time to VO is not necessarily diagnostic for specific ER effects. Nonetheless, when used in combination with the in vitro ER binding, ERTA and uterotrophic assays, the distinction between an ER mechanism and other HPG mechanisms is readily apparent. Although knowing the MOA of a particular chemical-induced response is not a criteria for Tier 1, any information gained in this area may be used in designing a strategy for further testing in the EDSP Tier 2. The female pubertal assay can contribute information on specific estrogen-related biological responses for which absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) are fully taken into account and is crucial to the identification of anti-estrogens and SERMs (e.g., tamoxifen) since oral gavage is the route of exposure. 5. Fish Short-Term Reproduction Assay The fish short-term reproduction assay with fath ead minnows is designed to detect changes in spawning, morphology, and specific biochemical endpoints that reflect disturbances in the HPG axis in response to estrogen agonists and antagonists. Collectively, the endpoints allow for inferences with regard to possible endocrine disturbances involving the estrogen hormonal pathway and, thus, provide guidance for further testing in the EDSP Tier 2. Vitellogenin is an egg yolk protein in which production is primarily controlled through estrogen-receptor interactions. There are commercially available immunoassay kits specific to the fathead minnow that have made vitellogenin production readily measurable; hence, it is a well-established endpoint. Induction of vitellogenin in male fish is an extremely sensitive and specific indication of ER agonists since males have very low circulating concentrations of endogenous estrogen. Reproductively active females have moderate circulating concentrations of vitellogenin, which can be decreased by ER antagonists. Estrogens and anti-estrogens can also affect egg production in the fish assay. Changes in fecundity combined with alterations in gonadal histopathology provide a good indication of reproductive health and have been demonstrated to be sensitive to estrogenic and anti-estrogenic exposures. B. Assays for detection of compounds that affect the androgen signaling pathway. Androgens are critical for sexual differentiation and development of secondary sex characteristics in the male, as well as for a wide variety of functions in both males and females. To date, a number of environmental chemicals have been shown to act as a ndrogens or anti-androgens. Four assays within the EDSP Tier-1 screening battery are capable of detecting whether or not a chemical affects androgen receptor function. Together these assays are expected to detect chemicals with androgenic and anti- androgenic activity and include: 1) AR binding, 2) Hershberger, 3) pubertal male and 4) fish short-term reproduction assays. The in vitro AR binding assay provides mechanistic information on the cellular (nuclear) mode of action. The three in vivo assays provide confirmatory evidence for the effects of a chemical on the reproductive system. Specifically, the Hershberger assay is diagnostic for both androgenic and anti- androgenic activity. The male pubertal and fish reproduction assays reflect changes in AR regulation but, due to their apical nature, are also sensitive to chemicals that may affect other modes of action involved in HPG function. Again, interpreting results of these assa ys within the battery is accomplished by examining the results of all assays, as the sum of all of the datasets in a weight-of-evidence approach is far greater than the information provided by any one assay alone. A brief description as well as the value of each of the four assays for detection of compounds that can potentially affect the androgen signaling pathway is ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 125 provided. In addition, an example with a positive test chemical involving the following assays and this MOA is presented in Section IV. 1. AR Binding Assay The androgen receptor binding assay (AR binding), utilizing rat prostate cytosol, is a rapid in vitro assay that measures the affinity of a test chemical to bind to the androgen receptor. It is a mechanistic assay that measures only ligand-receptor interactions. As with the ER binding assay, its technical simplicity and high-throughput format are conducive for screening large numbers of chemicals. Thus, the assay is a valuable tool for identifying chemicals that can compete with the endogenous ligand. While the AR binding assay detects both agonists an d antagonists, it cannot distinguish between the two. Thus, it can be used in conjunction with the Hershberger assay which can distinguish agonists from antagonists. 2. The Hershberger assay is a short-term in vivo screen that evaluates the ability of a chemical to elicit biological activities consistent with either androgen agonists or antagonists by utilizing changes in the weights of five androgen-dependent tissues: 1) ventral prostate, 2) seminal (LABC) muscle, 4) Co wper's glands, and 5) glans penis. Specifically, an increase in tissue weights is diagnostic of androgenic activity. In contrast, an anti-androgenic chemical will block any increase in tissue weights when co-administered with an androgen such as testosterone propionate. The Hershberger contributes to the battery by providing information on a specific androgen-related biological response and, being an in vivo assay, integrates ADME into the responses. The assay has been used to identify the anti-androgenic effects of several chemicals including vinclozolin and flutamide. 3. Pubertal Male Assay The male pubertal assay is an in vivo test sensitive to disruptions by chemicals that act as androgens or anti-androgens or interfere with androgen synthesis. Importantly, as an in vivo assay, it can detect chemicals which require metabolism in order to interact with the AR. For example, chemicals such as vinclozolin delay the age of preputial separation (i.e., onset of puberty) and decrease the growth of androgen dependent tissues. The male pubertal assay is reproducible and sensitive for chemicals which alter androgenic hormone action and provides useful confirmatory information for AR agonists and antagonists which are detected in the in vitro AR receptor assay. 4. Fish Short-Term Reproduction Assay Secondary sex characteristics of fathead minnows are endpoints that are affected by androgenic/anti- androgenic substances. Specifically, females will develop external male secondary sex characteristics (nuptial tubercles) when exposed to an AR agonist. This endpoint is not only specific for this mode of action, but very sensitive in that females typically do not express these characteristics. In contrast, AR antagonists decrease the expression of male secondary sex characteristics in male fathead minnows. Changes in secondary sex characteristics in fathead minnows are biologically relevant, unique and robust. Inter-laboratory comparisons of these endpoints have been reproducible. Androgens and anti-androgens also effectively inhibit egg production in the fish assay with concurrent alterations in gonadal histopathology. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 126 C. Assays for detection of compounds that affect reproductive steroidogenesis A number of environmental compounds have been shown to interfere with the synthesis of estrogens (e.g., estradiol) and androgens ( e.g., testosterone). In this regard, a number of in vitro assays for steroidogenesis were considered for the battery with the decision to include the H295R cell line as it offers the potential to identify chemicals that induce or inhibit estradiol and testosterone synthesis. In addition, since many environmental compounds are known to inhibit aromatase and the conversion of androgen substrates to estrogen, the decision was made to validate a human recombinant aromatase assay. A combination of in vitro and in vivo assays is expected to provide sufficient information for making informed decisions as to whether or not a compound interferes with the production of estrogens and androgens and include: 1) steroidogenesis, 2) aromatase 3) pubertal female, 4) pubertal male and 5) fish short-term reproduction assays. A brief description as well as the value of each of the five assays for detection of compounds that can potentially affect steroidogenesis is provided. In addition, an example with a positive test chemical involving the following assays and this MOA is presented in Section IV. 1. Steroidogenesis (H295R) Assay H295R is a human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line that possesses all of the key enzymes throughout the steroidogenic pathways. Several studies have shown that these enzymes and their mRNA and intermediate and end products can all be readily measured in a high-throughput format. For the purposes of the EDSP Tier-1 screening battery, the measurement of estradiol and testosterone produced with or without the test compound are the key endpoints. Consid ering that the H295R cell 's ability to metabolize xenobiotics is apparently low, the assay provides a straightforward, inexpensive and specific way to detect chemicals that affect steroid hormone synthesis either by inhibiting the enzymes in the pathway, leading to decreased production of one or more of the endpoints hormones, or inducing the production of enzymes, leading to increased production of one or more of the endpoint hormones. While other assays in the battery can detect the adverse effects of chemicals that interfere with steroid hormone synthesis, they can not identify the specific component of the pathway that was altered. The H295R steroidogenesis assay has been standardized and examined with a number of positive and negative test compounds. Inter-laboratory validation has been completed and results have been submitted for peer review. The protocol is expected to be available at the EDSP website in late 2008. 2. Aromatase (human recombinant) Assay The human recombinant aromatase assay is an inexpensive, rapid method to detect chemicals that inhibit aromatase activity and thus block the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Together, the aromatase steroidogeneisis assays are complimentary within the Tier-1 battery and are the only assays that have been shown to be sensitive enough to detect th e activity of xenobiotics that weakly inhibit aromatase and estrogen synthesis. 3. Pubertal Female and Pubertal Male Assays Changes in the numerous hormone-dependent endpoints in the male and female pubertal assays will detect the effects of a chemical that interferes with endogenous steroid hormone production by the testes and ovaries, respectively. Together, the pubertal male and steroidogenesis assays provide diagnostic information necessary to discern impaired estrogen and androgen production. The male pubertal assay has also been shown to detect chemicals that affect steroidogenesis prior to the formation of estrogen (e.g. , ketoconazole). The female pubertal assay will detect effects of altered aromatase activity. For example, inhibition of aromatase activity by fadrazole altered estrogen-dependent endpoints. Although both the male and female pubertal protocols have the capacity to readily detect compounds that affect steroidogenesis, the proper diagnosis for a steroidogen ic mode of action can only be made with supporting ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 127 in vitro data. It has also been shown that measurement of androgen hormone levels enhances the sensitivity of the male pubertal assay to detect chemicals that block androgen synthesis by the testes. 4. Fish Short-Term Reproduction Assay Interference in the steroid synthesis pathways is detected by several endpoints in the fish assay. Proliferation of interstitial cells (Leydig cells) in the male testes, reduction of circulating concentrations of steroids, decreased plasma vitellogenin in females, and impaired reproduction would all signal potential steroid synthesis modulation. D. Assays for detection of chemicals that affect the HPG axis The EDSTAC determined that evaluating the effect of environmental chemicals on the hypothalamic- pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG) was also important. To address this issue, the battery includes the male and female pubertal assays and the fish short-term reproduction assay, which includes both male and female fish. The hypothalamic-pituitary regulation of reproductive development and function is sensitive to a number of environmental compounds, as there are a variety of target mechanisms that can be affected. It is well known that many pharmaceuticals can interfere with hypothalamic regulation of gonadal function and ultimately gonadal hormone and gamete production. Similarly, environmental compounds such as dithiocarbamates, formamidines, chlorotriazines, am ong others, have been found to interfere with endocrine function by altering the hypothalamic regulation of pituitary hormone synthesis and secretion. By this mode of action, it has been shown that ma ny of these same chemicals can interfere with reproductive development and aging. Although it is not necessary to know the underlying MOA of a particular response affecting EAT during the screening process, the EDSP Tier-1 battery is designed to use the combined results of the in vivo tests included in the battery to determine deductively that the HPG axis was altered. For example, if a chemical is found to delay preputial separation and vaginal opening in both male and female rats, respectively, but that ER or AR binding or steroidogenes is were not altered, it would be concluded that the delay in puberty is attributed to impaired hypothalamic-pituitary function. This is the profile produced by compounds that act on the central nervous system such as dithiocarbamate thiram (impairs when assessed in the male and pubertal assays. Pharmaceuticals such as bromocriptine, pimozide and haloperidol, which alter dopaminergic receptor function, have also been evaluated in the pubertal assays. In every case, these compounds that act on the central nervous system were found to alter normal pubertal development. The fish short-term reproduction assay with fa thead minnows is designed to detect changes in spawning, morphology and specific biochemical endpoints that reflect alterations axis, including (anti-) estrogen and (anti-) androgen pathways. Again, the combined results of the in vivo assay included in the battery are to determine deductively that the HPG axis was altered. An example of the type of exercise that will be needed to differentiate an effect on the HPG axis versus other potential modes of action is shown in Table 4. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 128 Table 4: Profiles Diagnostic for Various Modes of Action (MOA) in the Tier-1 Screening Battery Following Chemical Exposure. Assay Was an effect detected? ER Binding Yes No No No AR Binding No Yes No No Steroidogenesis No No Yes No Male Pubertal No Yes Yes Yes Female Pubertal Yes No Yes Yes Fish Yes Yes Yes Yes Likely MOA: ER AR Steroidogenesis HPG E. Assays for detection of chemicals that affect the HPT axis In addition to identifying environmental compounds that have the potential to alter the hormonal regulation of reproductive function involving the estrogen and androgen hormonal pathways, certain assays included in the proposed Tier-1 screening battery will al so provide relevant information about the potential of a chemical to interfere with thyroid function. Thyroid hormones are essential for normal development and maintenance of physiological functions in vertebrates. Delivery of thyroid hormones to tissues and cells is highly regulated during early development and in the adult and is governed by complex physiological processes involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, including peripheral organs/tissues. Environmental factors, such as the presence of specific toxicants, can perturb this system at various points of regulation, inducing a variety of responses that can be detected with thyroid-related endpoints in the in vivo assays. Three assays have been designed for this purpose: 1) pubertal female, 2) pubertal male and 3) amphibian metamorphosis. A brief description as well as the value of each of the three assays for detection of compounds that can potentially interfere with thyroid development and function is provided. In addition, an example with a positive test chemical involving the following assays and this MOA is presented in Section IV. 1. Pubertal Male and Female Assays The pubertal male and female assays include multiple endpoints that can detect an interaction of a test chemical with the thyroid hormone system, includi ng serum TSH and T4concentrations, thyroid organ weight and histology, and liver weight. Both the male and the female assays have been shown to detect thyrotoxicants that act by various mechanisms that interfere with the synthesis and elimination of thyroid hormones. While the male and female pubertal assays include the same thyroid endpoints, examining the thyroid axis in both sexes provides the opportunity to detect gender differences in response to treatment. It is not clear whether the male or the female is more sensitive to toxicants that interfere with the thyroid axis at this early age. However, the male pubertal assay may be more robust than the female because the male is treated slightly longer. It has been shown in prevalidation studies that the male may be more sensitive to chemicals that induce hepatic clearance of thyroid hormones based on the response to lower dose levels. In the male assay, a food restriction study showed that a re duction in terminal weight of 9% or greater relative to controls could result in a decrease in circulating T4 concentrations. This effect will need to be considered when interpreting the battery for the thyr oid MOA. Together, the complimentary results among the in vivo assays are expected to assist with interpretation of the data, as one change in a single endpoint will not be interpreted as a positive result if the other assays find no effect involving the HPT axis. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 129 2. Amphibian Metamorphosis Assay The amphibian metamorphosis assay (AMA) is a screening assay intended to identify substances which interfere with the normal function of the HPT axis. The AMA represents a generalized vertebrate model to the extent that it is based on the cons erved structure and function of thyroid systems among species. The AMA provides a well studied, thyroid dependent process which responds to substances active along the HPT axis, and it is the only assay for the Tier-1 battery that assesses thyroid activity in a species undergoing morphological development. The AMA is based on the principle that the dramatic morphological changes that occur during post-embryonic development are dependent upon the normal functioning of the HPT axis, and that interference with these processes leads to measurable effects. During tadpole metamorphosis, thyroid hormone (TH) influences virtually every tissue in the animal's body initiating diverse morphological, physiological and biochemical changes that include cell proliferation, differentiation and death. The result is de novo organ formation, organ loss, and extensive tissue remodeling. Given the dependence of metamorphosis on TH, and the strict biochemical control under which these processes occur, the timing and character of these processes can serve as endpoints representative of thyroid axis function and, as such, are exploited in the AMA. Additionally, although post-embryonic development appears quite different in mammals and most amphibians (direct development versus metamorphosis), there is a high level of evolutionary conservation of the thyroid system among vertebrates and the underlying cellular and molecular pathways that control these processes are similar, if not identical. The evolutionarily conserved nature of the vertebrate thyroid system enhances the ability to use an amphibian, particularly Anurans , as a general model for evaluating HPT axis interference such that the results can be extrapolated to other vertebrate species. The primary endpoints in the AMA are developmental stage, hindlimb length, and thyroid histology. Each endpoint can be affected by chemicals that interact with the HPT axis. For example, antagonists of thyroid production, iodination and action, such as perchlorate and methimazole, will delay development and induce diagnostic lesions in the thyroid gland. Thyroid agonists ( e.g., native thyroid hormone) will accelerate development. Additionally, unlike the mammalian assays that have been developed to detect interactions along the HPT axis, the AMA has the ability to detect chemicals that act on peripheral tissues. For example, inhibition of monodeiodinases that transform T4 to T3 can cause asynchronous development, detected by an inability to assign a developmental stage to a tadpole. Knowledge of this mechanism is important because, in this case, development can be affected without concomitant effects on thyroid histology or circulating thyroid hormone. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 130 IV. Case examples with known test chemicals that interact with the EAT hormonal systems This section illustrates how the dynamics of the EDSP Tier-1 screening battery can perform through the use of selective examples with test chem icals known to interact with the E, A or T hormonal pathways. The examples comprise a group of individual assays that were designed to cover specific modes of action (MOA) within the battery as discussed in Section III. An overview of the results is presented as part of a validation process that was conduct by th e EPA and OECD for individual screening assays. A detailed account of the EPA validation process and results for each assay can be found at the EDSP website. http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/oscpendo/pubs/assayvalidation/status.htm A. Estrogen MOA and complimentary Tier-1 assays : 1) estrogen receptor (ER) binding, 2) ER transcriptional activation (ER TA), 3) uterotrophic, 4) pubertal female, and 5) fish short-term reproduction. 1. Methoxychlor - a pesticide in which the parent compound is a weak binder compared to the metabolites ER Binding assay Ki = 65 \u00b1 9 uM ER TA assay (hER-HeLa-9903) PC max = 33.4 \u00b1 0.2% Table 1. Methoxychlor binds in a positive manner to the estrogen receptor as shown by the inhibition constant (K i). Methoxychlor failed to achieve a PC 50; therefore, PC max was given. The PC max indicates that methoxychlor was approximately 33% as effective as the positive control in activating transcription. Uterotrophic assay Uterine wt Fold change Methoxychlor Ethynyl Estradiol mg/kg/day ug/kg/day Figure 1. Results averaged over three contract laboratories using ovariectomized rats following subcutaneous injection with methoxychlor. Relative to the vehicle control (0 mg/kg/day) which equals 1 fold change in uterine weight methoxychlor is not different (P>0.05) at 20 mg/kg/day (gray bar) but is different (P<0.05) at 100 to 800 mg/kg/day (red bars). Si milarly, the positive control is different (P<0.05) from vehicle control at 0.3 and 1.0 ug/kg/day (green bars). 00.511.522.533.5 20 100 250 500 800 EE- 0.3EE- 1.0 ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 131 Pubertal female assay End point Methoxychlor dose level (mg/kg/day) 0 12.5 25 50 Age at VO (d) 31.9 *Different (P<0.05) from vehicle control. Table 2. Methoxychlor exposure via oral gavage induced early onset of puberty as indicated by a significant reduction in age and body weight (BW) at the time of vaginal opening (VO) beginning at 12.5 mg/kg/day. In addition, age at first estrus and percent of regular cycles were significantly reduced beginning at 12.5 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day, respectively. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 132 Fish short-term reproduction assay Figure 2. Methoxychlor induced vitellogenin production and inhibited testosterone production in males and estradiol production in females at 3.56 \u00b5g/L. Females Males 0 5 10 GSI 0 2 4 0 4 8 E2 133 Fish short-term reproduction 3. Methoxychlor significantly reduced egg production at 3.56 \u00b5g/L from 20.5 to 8.3 eggs/female/day versus control. Methoxychlor summary - The relatively weak but positive response of native methoxychlor in the in vitro ER assays and in vivo uterotrophic assay was corroborated by the relatively strong positive response of apparent methoxychlor metabolite (s) in the in vivo female pubertal and fish reproduction assays. Hence, the combined positive responses among all assays provides a strong weight of evidence that methoxychlor interacts with the estrogen hormonal path way in an agonistic way. Consequently, further testing would be triggered in the EDSP Tier 2. 2. Bisphenol A - an industrial compound primarily used in the production of polycarbonate plastics which is estrogenic in vitro with mixed results in vivo . ER binding assay Full binding curve, %RBA = 0.2 ER TA assay (hER-HeLa-9903) Log PC 50 = -6.14 Table 3.

Relative to the vehicle control (0 mg/kg/day) which equals 1 fold change in uterine weight bisphenol A is not different (P>0.05) at 10 mg/kg/day (gray bar) but is different (P<0.05) at 100 to 800 mg/kg/day (red bars). Si milarly, the positive control is different (P<0.05) from vehicle control at 0.3 and 1.0 ug/kg/day (green bars). Pubertal female assay End point Bisphenol A dose level (mg/kg/day) 0 400 600 Age at (d) 34.4 34.3 *Different (P<0.05) from vehicle control. Table 4. Results following bisphenol A exposure via oral gavage were considered negative. The only effect observed was a significant reduction in body we ight (BW) beginning at 400 mg/kg/day and BW at the time of vaginal opening (VO) at 600 mg/kg/day. 00.511.522.533.5 10 100 300 600 800 5. Bisphenol A (BPA) impaired egg production at the high dose and induced vitellogenin in males at both dose levels. Bisphenol A summary - The effects of BPA in the in vitro ER assays and in vivo uterotrophic and fish reproduction assays were complimentarily positive. Unlike the subcutaneous and aquatic routes of exposure for the uterotrophic and fish assays, respectively, the oral route of exposure and first-pass metabolism of BPA in the pubertal female assay apparently led to a negative response. The combined results demonstrate the strength of the EDSP Tier 1 screening battery by incorporating both in vitro and in vivo assays with different routes of exposure and taxa to minimize false negatives. Thus, a positive response in a majority of the assays provides sufficient weight of evidence to indicate BPA interacts with the estrogen hormonal pathway in an agonistic way. Consequently, further testing would be triggered in the EDSP Tier 2. B. Androgen MOA and complimentary Tier-1 assays: 1) AR binding, 2) Hershberger, 3) pubertal male and 4) fish short-term reproduction. 1. Vinclozolin - a pesticide that has anti-androgenic effects. AR binding assay Equivocal Table 5 . Vinclozolin was listed as equivocal in the AR binding assay using rat prostate cytosol because it gave a partial binding curve that did not cross the 50% binding threshold. The partial curve may have been observed because the highest concentration at which it was tested was 10-4 M, rather than the limit dose of 10-3 M. 05,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 30,000 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 012345678910 11 12 1 14 15 1 17 18 1 20 21 Bisphenol A Control 64 640 * Eggs spawned Days from ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 136 Hershberger assay Vinclozolin dose level (mg/kg/day) End point 0 3 10 30 100 VP (mg) 131 (34) 120 (21)* 104 (25)* 78 (21)* 69 (34)* SV (mg) 348 344 (30) 271 (30)* 187 (36)* 69 (34)* LABC (mg) 506 (21) 485 (25) 445 (20)* 374 (20)* 256 (23)* GP (mg) 80 (13) 78 (12) 75 (9)* 70 (10)* 57 (12)* Cow (mg) 30 (27) 29 (29) 25 (30)* 20 (25) 12 (38)* *Different (P<0.05) from vehicle control. Table 6. Vinclozolin exposure via oral gavage using gonadoectomized rats resulted in a significant reduction in weight of the ventral prostrate at 3 to 100 mg/kg/day and, for all other end points, a significant reduction in organ weight began at 10 mg/kg/day. Pubertal male assay End point Vinclozolin dose level (mg/kg/day) 0 30 100 Age at PPS \u00b1 0.7 43.8 \u00b1 7. Vinclozolin exposure via oral gavage delayed onset of puberty as indicated by a significant increase in age and body weight (BW) at the time of preputial separation (PPS) beginning at 30 mg/kg/day. In addition, seminal vesicles (SV), levator ani/bulbocavernosus muscle epididymides were significantly decreased at 100 mg/kg/day. Testes weight was significantly increased at 30 mg/kg/day. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 137 Fish short-term reproduction assay Dose levels (ug/L) at ug/L Gonad increased at 255 ug/L Tubercles decreased ug/L Reference Martinovic et al. 2008. ET&C 27(2):478-488 Table 8. Vinclozolin reduced egg production and increased oocyte atresia at all test concentrations ( 60, 255, and 450 \u00b5g/L) and reduced male SSC at the highest test concentration. Vinclozolin summary - The positive response among the in vivo Hershberger, male pubertal and fish reproduction assays compliment one another despite a lack of a corroborating response in the in vitro AR assay. Unlike the in vivo assays, the AR in vitro assay does not have the capacity for metabolism, which apparently led to the equivocal response. The combined results again demonstrate the strength of the EDSP Tier-1 screening battery by incorporating both in vitro and in vivo assays to minimize false negatives. Thus, positive responses among the in vivo assays provides a greater weight of evidence over the equivocal response in the in vitro assay to indicate vinclozolin interacts with the androgen hormonal pathway in an antagonistic way. Consequently, furt her testing would be triggered in the EDSP Tier 2. C. Steroidogenesis MOA and complimentary Tier-1 assays: 1) steroidogenesis, 2) aromatase 3) pubertal female, 4) pubertal male and 5) fish short-term reproduction. 1. Ketoconazole - a pesticide and pharmaceutical that alters steroidogenic enzymes resulting in enhanced progesterone and reduced estrogen androgen production. Steroidogenesis assay (Recombinant human aromatase) Full binding curve, Log IC 50 = -7.16 Table 9. Ketoconzaole inhibited the production of both testosterone and estradiol production >90% relative to vehicle control in the H295R assay. It also produced a full inhibition curve in the recombinant aromatase assay. This is consistent with a chemical that is a non-specific P450 inhibitor as it inhibits enzymes upstream and downstream of testosterone. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 138 Pubertal female assay End point Ketoconazole dose level (mg/kg/day) 0 50 100 Age at 92 at first estrus (d) 33.5 \u00b1 0.8 33.3 \u00b1 0.6 35.1 \u00b1 0.8 Regular (%) 93 control and **numerically different from vehicle control.

In addition, seminal vesicles (SV) were significantly decreased beginning at 50 mg/kg/day. Fish short-term reproduction assay End point Ketoconazole dose level (\u00b5g/L) 0 400 Testicular histopathology Interstitial areas contain small aggregates of Leydig cells which have wispy, pale cytoplasm. Relative to controls, aggregates of Leydig cells are larger, tending to fill and expand the interstitial space. Grade 2 (mild) severity. Table 12. Ketoconazole induces Leydig cell proliferation in male testes at 400 \u00b5g/L. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 139 Ketoconazole summary - Alterations in ovarian and testicular morphology in the in vivo female and male pubertal and fish reproduction assays as well as delayed puberty in the male pubertal assay were corroborated by results in the in vitro steroidogenesis and aromatase assays. Hence, the positive responses among all in vitro and in vivo assays provide a strong weight of evidence to indicate ketoconazole likely interferes in the steroidogenic pathway. Consequently , further testing would be triggered in the EDSP Tier 2. D. Thyroid MOA and complimentary Tier-1 assays: 1) pubertal female, 2) pubertal male and 3) amphibian metamorphosis. 1.

ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 141 Perchlorate summary - Alterations in thyroid gland weight, histomorphology and associated hormones in the in vivo female and male pubertal and amphibian metamorphosis assays provides a strong weight of evidence that perchlorate interferes in thyroid development and function. Consequently, further testing would be triggered in the EDSP Tier 2. E. Interpretation of the results of the EDSP Tier-1 screening battery A science-based approach to interpretation of the results of the battery will generally follow the principles recommended by EDSTAC. The major principles include: 1. Interpretation of the battery will be considered in light of the results of all assays in the battery, using a weight-of-evidence approach, taking into consideration in vitro/in vivo discrepancies (if any), metabolism, and route of exposure. 2. When all screening assays are performed and all assays are negative, it may be concluded that the chemical will not likely interact with EAT hormonal processes included in the battery. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 142 United States Environmental Protection Agency's Research Program on Endocrine Disruptors In 1994, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) made the decision, as a result of increasing public health and ecological concerns, to integrate and expand its ongoing efforts into a consolidated Endocrine Disruptors Research Program (EDRP). To better understand the state of the science at the time and to identify the key science questions that needed to be addressed, USEPA held two international workshops in 1995 and efforts began to develop a national research plan. In 1996, several events took place that shaped the USEPA's priorities from both a research and a programmatic perspective: 1) USEPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) iden tified endocrine disruptors as one of its top six research priorities. This was based upon recognition of: a) the potential scope of the problem , b) the possibility of serious effects on the health of populations , c) the persistence of some endocrine-disrupting agents in the environment , and d) the widespread global concern about the fate and transport over national borders. 2) Through enactment of the Food Quality Protection Act and amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act, the US Congress directed USEPA to screen pesticides and drinking water contaminants, respectively, for their potential estrog enic or other endocrine activity in humans, using validated studies. In order to meet the Congressional mandates, a number of scientific questions needed to be addressed through research. USEPA's research program and the development and implementation of the mandated Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP), which is described elsewhere in this document, therefore, have been on parallel highly interactive tracks for almost 13 years. ORD's Endocrine Disruptors Research Plan was published in 1998 11. Since then, ORD has developed a Multi-Year Plan for Endocrine Disruptors that identifies the specific science questions that will be addressed over the next five to ten years. This document is updated every few years to take into account the current state of the science and the updated strategic directions of the program (www.epa.gov/ord/npd/pdfs/Draft-EDCs-MYP-091407.pdf). In the Multi-Year Plan , ORD has identified three Long-Term Goals (LTGs) that will provide the Agency: 1) the methods it needs to implement EDSP, 2) scientific underpinnings to be able to interp ret data from EDSP and incorporate them into risk assessments and Agency decisions, and 3) an improved understanding of the impacts of endocrine disruptors on humans and wildlife. The highest priority for the USEPA EDRP has been the development of protocols for the assays critical to the Agency's EDSP. Over the last thirteen years the program has conducted much of the underlying research, developed and standardized protocols, prepared background materials for transfer, briefed Agency advisory committees, participated on international committees on harmonization of protocols, and/or participated in validation of approximately 19 different in vitro and in vivo assays for the development and implementation of the Agency's two tiered EDSP. The focus of these activities has been on estrogenic-, androgenic-, and thyroid-mediated mechanisms using mammalian, fish, amphibian, and invertebrate models. Collectively this part of the EDRP has lead to the development of protocols critical to the success of the Agency in fulfilling its Congress ional mandates to develop and implement a screening and testing program. (See section on Overview of EDSP elsewhere in this document for details). As data begin to be submitted to the Agency through the EDSP, the USEPA needs to be able to interpret the findings and integrate them into assessments. There are a number of scientific uncertainties for which research is still needed, and, thus, is continually being addressed through the EDRP. For example, research has been addressing the following science areas and is continuing to focus on: Understanding of how endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) elicit toxicity through receptor-based interactions, membrane receptors, enzyme alterations, and other non-nuclear receptor-based pathways, particularly at the low end of the dose-response curve which is especially relevant to evaluating effects 11 www.epa.gov/ord/htm/documents/ORD-EDR-Feb1998.pdf ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 143 at ambient environmental levels of exposure. This body of research will lead to improved methods to interpret data and, thus, develop improved risk assessments. Determining the degree to which the effects of EDCs with defined mechanisms/modes of action (MOAs) can be extrapolated across classes of vertebrates. This research is needed to: 1) reduce the uncertainty associated with extrapolating effects of chemicals across species, and 2) understand the degree to which quantitative extrapolation is defensible/possible and comparative toxicological studies using chemicals with well-defined MOAs are necessary. Of significance, the development of approaches to evaluate and conduct inter-species extrapolation research should ultimately help reduce uncertainties in both human health and ecological risk assessments and reduce the number of animals needed for testing. Developing approaches to assess exposures to mixtures of EDCs . The current Agency default for predicting the effects of mixtures is to assume dose addition. There is a critical need to determine if this assumption accurately predicts the empirical effects of mixtures of endocrine disruptors, with similar and with different mechanisms of action. Furthermore, it is critical to develop approaches to facilitate incorporation of these data into risk assessments. Determining the critical factors th at account for exposures during deve lopment resulting in toxicities occurring later in life (e.g., windows of vulnerability, developmental tissue dosimetry, modes of action). Development is a period when hormone-mediated changes in gene expression can have permanent consequences that may not be apparent until later in life because functional changes do not occur until puberty or adulthood and during which extraordinary changes occur. Developing biomarkers and the next generation of assays for screening chemicals for their potential endocrine disruption. There is a need to take advantage of the tremendous growth in the development of newer molecular approaches and develop predictive biomarkers and the next generation of assays for possible use in subsequent rounds of EDSP. The main advantage of these assays is that they often take less time to evaluate chemicals for their ability to interact with the endocrine system, cost less than other more conventional assays and test, and reduce (and in some cases eliminate) the use of whole animals. These latter elements are consistent with the recently issued National Academy of Sciences report on recommendations for a new testing paradigm in Toxicity Testing in the 21 st Century (www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11970#toc). What are the major sources and environmental fa tes of EDCs? How can unreasonable risks be managed? There is a need to develop chemical and molecular indicators of exposure on the highest priority endocrine-active chemicals. There are a number of existing risk management tools that possibly could be applied to reduce exposures to EDCs. If technologies exist that can be applied to major sources of exposure, the impact could potentially be a major reduction of EDCs released to the environment. The USEPA is focusing on applying its efforts to identify the key factors that influence human exposures to EDCs and major sources of EDCs entering the environment, such as from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), and drinking water treatment plants and is developing tools for risk reduction and mitigation strategies related to these sources. One of the biggest unanswered questions regarding EDCs is to what extent do they impact humans, wildlife and the environment. USEPA research, therefore, is: Determining the extent to which human development/reproduction is being adversely affected by exposure to EDCs. Given that development and reproduction appear to be highly sensitive endpoints in laboratory animal and wildlife studies and that there are reported alterations in particular endpoints (e.g., hypospadias, cryptorchidism, sperm quality), if any adverse effects are to be found, then evaluating these ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 144 endpoints in humans appears to be logical. Through a multi-US Federal Agency solicitation for proposals, 12 epidemiologic studies were funded, collectively. Characterizing the occurrence and effects of endocrine active compounds in complex environmental media and developing management approa ches to mitigate unreasonable risks. It is important to understand the extent of EDC exposures and the factors influencing the source-to-exposure-to-dose relationships in order to develop effective risk management strategies. Gaining improved understanding regarding the fate and transport processes, the interactions of EDCs from the source to the receptor, and collecting high quality exposure data for the develo pment of multimedia, multi-pathway models are critical for ecological and human health risk assessments. Appl ication of biological indicators of exposure to the study of components of mixtures offers the potential to validate and refine these models. The USEPA is applying the methods, models, and tools that it and other organizations have been developing to characterize releases from WWTPs, drinking water plants, and CAFOs and to develop management approaches that would mitig ate any unreasonable risks. Over the last thirteen years, the USEPA EDRP has provided critical data that have improved risk assessments within EPA and other organizations, have resulted in a suite of assays that have been validated for use in implementing EDRP, and are producing info rmation that is helping the scientific community better understand the impact that EDCs are having on the environment. The USEPA EDRP has been reviewed by external peer review panels composed of experts in the field (www.epa.gov/osp/bosc/pdf/edc0504rpt.pdr and www.epa.gov.osp/bosc/pdf.edcmc0804rpt.pdf ) who found the program to have significant leadership in EDC research.\" USEPA's EDRP and EDSP have integrated their efforts to help the Agency achieve a long term outcome of reducing or preventing risk to humans and wildlife from exposure to endocrine disruptors. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 145 United States Environmental Protection Agency's Research Program on Computational Toxicology As Related to Endocrine Di sruptors and Other Chemicals As part of its Computational Toxicology Research Program, USEPA is carrying out a large-scale experiment, called ToxCast, to test a high throughput screening (HTS) in vitro approach to identify potential toxicity. The aims of ToxCast are to screen the backlog of thousands of untested environmental contaminants using a battery of in vitro assays, and to prioritize chemicals for further testing based on bioactivity associated with pathways leading to toxicity. Phase I of ToxCast is testing 309 unique chemicals (320 including replicates), most of which had extensive animal toxicity testing, in order to develop initial predictive approaches that can be used in later large-scale screening phases. These Phase I chemicals are mostly pesticidal active ingredients, plus a number of high production volume industrial chemicals. The toxicity data for these chemicals is contained within the ToxRefDB relational database, facilitating the building of predictive models and comparisons within and across chemical classes. Information on ToxCast and ToxRef can be found at www.epa.gov/ncct . ToxCast Phase I chemical library is being run against 470 separate assays derived from 9 separate assay technologies, all run in concentration response format and, in some cases, with multiple time points. These include cell-free biochemical assays of receptor binding and enzyme transcription factor activity assays, cell-imaging assays and real-time cellular impedance measurements. Among the assays are four that evaluate the androgen signalling pathway, five that relate to estrogen signalling, four to thyroid signalling, and one to aromatase activity. Comparisons between ToxCast endocrine profiling and the results from Tier 1 EDSP battery will be made as those results are obtained, as there are approximately 55 of the EDSP priority chemicals contained with the ToxCast Phase 1 chemical library. ToxCast is part of a research collaboration between the USEPA, the National Toxicology Program, the National Institute of Health (NIH) Chemical Genomic Center, and a number of other organizations, screening thousands of environmental contaminants and pharmaceutical compounds to identify mechanisms and pathways leading to human toxicity. In addition, USEPA is work ing through the OECD's Toxicogenomics Advisory Committee to facilitate international cooperation re lated to high throughput molecular screening.

Atrazine inhibits the pulsatile release of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus which in turn suppresses the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary. Understanding of atrazine's neuroendocrine mode of action (MoA) in laboratory animals (rats) was used to address issues about human relevance that had consequences on risk management decisions about public health . \u00be MoA for the rat mammary gland tumors was considered not to be relevant to humans given that the LH suppression was affecting a reproductive aging process unique to the rat. \u00be MoA and atrazine's effect on LH and consequent effects on development and reproduction in the rat was assumed to be relevant to humans given the homology of the hypothalamic-pituitary control on normal reproductive development and function.

(http://www.who.int/ipcs/methods/ harmonization/areas/cancer_mode.pdf ) An endocrine key event in atrazine's MoA, LH suppression, was used as the basis of the dose response assessment (NOAEL = 1.8 mg/kg bw per day; LOAE L 3.65 mg/kg bw per day from a 6 month dietary rat study). Basing the point of departure and derivation of the reference dose (RfD) on LH suppression would protect for the down stream LH dependent effects on reproduction and development. The understanding of atrazine's neuroendocrine mode of action served as the basis for grouping certain chloro-s-triazine pesticides by a common mechanism of toxicity and served as the basis for a cumulative risk assessment.

Illustrates the importance of well designed studies across taxa and careful interpretation of literature studies. \u00be Fish Four fish life-cycle tests are available on freshwater fish; two of the studies resulted in reduced growth, one resulted in loss of equilibrium (b ehavioral effect), and one resulted in reduced survival. None of these effects were interpreted as indicative of effects on endocrine-mediated processes. For example, in a 20-day exposure of largemouth bass ( Micropterus salmoides ) to formulated atrazine at 100 ug/L, female bass exhibited significantly higher plasma estradiol and vitellogenin concentrations compared to controls while male bass exhibited significantly lower plasma 11- ketotestosterone concentrations. Results from this study were highly variable and their utility in risk assessment is uncertain. All of the regulatory endpoints used for evaluating risk of atrazine to aquatic animals were below the 100 ug/L value from the largemouth bass study and the 2003 IRED noted that potential adverse effects on non-target aquatic organisms including their populations and communties are likely to be greatest when atrazine concentrations in water equal or exceed approximately 10 to 20 ug/L on a recurrent basis or over a prolonged period of time. As such, the use of these more sensitive endpoints is likely protective of any potential effect of atrazine on fish at higher concentrations. \u00be Avians Two avian reproduction studies are available on atrazine. both bobwhite resulted in reduced egg production (NOAEC=225 mg/kg diet). In quail, there was wan increase in the number of defective eggs and a reduction in embryo viability while in mallards there was a reduction in egg hatchability. These results can be due to a number of factors and can not be clearly concluded as endocrine related. References: 1.

Negative findings were observed in the in vitro ER and AR binding assays and for the rat uterotrophic assay (except for a high dose result). However, a delay in female and male puberty was found in the EDSP Tier 1 rat pubertal assays which would be expected given atrazine's abi lity to suppress the pituitary LH surge which plays a role in sexual maturation. Positive results were also found in the in vitro steroidogenesis H295R assay. Although it has been reported that atrazine induces CY P19 or aromatase activity (an enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens) in certain human cell lines (Sanderson, 2000), in vivo results indicated no support for any atrazine-induced change in this enzyme's activity or gene expression in the rat's brain, testes or adipose tissue (Modic, that atrazine disrupts adrenal steroidgenesis in rats which may be related to the small increase in serum estrone and estradiol observed in the juvenile male (Stoker et al., 2000; Laws, 2006 and 2007 abstracts). This atrazine-induced adrenal response and possible subsequent increase in adrenal steroidogenesis, and peripheral conversion of androgen to estrone occurs at higher doses of atrazine than that required to decrease pituitary LH secretion, the regulatory endpoint in the EPA human health risk assessment. Thus, the suppression of LH represents the most sensitive and biologically plausible end point to protect human health from the potential neuroendocrine effects of atrazine. The overall results from the EDSP Tier 1 fish assay indicated that atrazine exposure had no statistically significant effects on assay endpoints. The only noteworthy findings were subtle changes in testicular histology, which included a significant decrease in the semeniferous tubule diameter in the high exposure group and an increased numb er of sperm at devel opmental stage 2A. Other noteworthy but not statistically significant trends were slight decreases in fecundity and E2 levels in females and T and 11-KT in males. References: 1. USEPA.

Considers the role of metabolites in the risk assessment. Ethylene thiourea (ETU) is metabolite and environmental degradate of mancozeb. Some of the thyroid toxicity of the parent compound may be attributed to ETU, since it is also known to disrupt thyroid hormone homeostasis. Thyroid endpoints were used for deriving the chronic RfD as well as endpoints for non-dietary exposures (incidental oral, dermal, and inhalation) (EPA, 2005). For example, The chronic dietary assessment is based on thyroid toxicity (LOAEL = 30.9 mg/kg/day based on thyroid toxicity). Incidental Oral exposure assessment (any duration; 1 day to 6 months) is based on decreased thyroxine ( LOAEL = Inhalation Exposures(any duration; 1 day to 6 months) is based on thyroid hyperplasia and decreased thyroxine (females) (LOAEL = 0.326 mg/L) based from a subchronic rat inhalation, study on thyroid hyperplasia and decreased thyroxine (females) Understanding the mode of action of thyroid disruption can be used to address issues about human relevance during different lifestages which can have consequences on risk management decisions about public health . Mancozeb produces rat thyroid follicular cell tumors. Rats are known to be substantially more sensitive than humans to the development of thyroid follicular cell tumors in response to thyroid hormone imbalance (e.g., IARC, 1999) Meek et al., 2003). Compounds that act by this mode of action are not likely to be carcinogenic to humans at doses that do not alter thyroid hormone homeostasis. Altered thyroid hormones may lead to neurodevelopmental effects in the young. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 150 Critical data need would be a comparative thyroid toxicity study in young and adult rats due to concern for thyroid imbalance and neurodevelopmental effects. WHO's International Programme for Chemical Safety's Human Relevance Framework provides a valuable analytical and harmonized approach to establish the human relevance of animal MoAs. Examples of other case studies on a thyroid disrupting mode of action for cancer and noncancer outcomes can be found at: (http://www.who.int/ipcs/methods/harmonization/areas/cancer_mode.pdf ), Meek B. et al, (2003), Crofton and Zoeller (2005), Zoeller and Crofton (2005). Ecological Risk Assessment Birds Three avian reproduction studies are available on mancozeb. In the two bobwhite quail ( Colinus platyrhynchos ) study, the weight of 14-day old surviving birds was reduced at the lowest adverse effect concentration. In one of the quail studies, additional adverse affects were observe d, including hatchling weight reduction and % decline in the 14-day old survivors. In the duck study, additional adverse affects observed at the LOAEC exposure concentration of 125 ppm ai in cluded reductions in the following: egg production; early and late embryo viability; hatchability; and offspring weight at hatch. These results can be due to a number of factors and can not be clearly concluded as endocrine related. Amphibians The role of a major metabolite considered in the endangered species risk assessment. In the California Red Legged Frog (CRLF) Risk Assessmen t for mancozeb, it was assumed that chronic exposure EECs and toxicity are mainly related to ethylenethiourea (ETU), the major degradate of mancozeb. The endpoint determined from a chronic freshwater invertebrate toxicity test conducted with ETU was used to assess potential indirect effects to the CRL via reduction of prey items (freshwater invertebrates). ETU adversely affected growth and reproduction of Daphnia magna at 4.1 ppm. Adult length, survival, and fecundity (mean number of young per adult per reproductive day) were significantly reduced at the 4.1ppm treatment level. The thyroid effects found in the mammalian (rat) studies indicate a potential endocrine effect for both human and ecological systems. A critical data need would be the amphibian morphogenesis assay to evaluate the sensitivity of wildlife to thyroid disruption. Mancozeb\" metabolite ETU has been evaluated in the EDSP Tier 1 Amphibian Metamorphosis Assay (see below). Fish A freshwater fish early life-stage study conducted on fathead minnow ( Pimephales promelas) is available on mancozeb. Survival and lack of growth effects were observed at a LOAEC of 2.19 ppb. This was not the endpoint used in the CRLF risk assessment. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 151 Results from the US Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) Assay Development and Validation Program ETU, which is a thyroid synthesis inhibitor, was found to alter metamorphic development and thyroid gland histology in the EDSP Tier 1 amphibian assay using X laevis (see http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/oscpendo/pubs/assayvalidation/status.htm.).

Considers the role of metabolites in the risk assessment including the establishment of food tolerances. \u00be Vinclozolin and two of its metabolites bind and inhibit the function of the androgen receptor. \u00be The two metabolites occur in mammals, plants, a nd soil and are responsible for much of the anti- androgenic activity attributable to vinclozolin. Differentiates life stage responses to vinclozolin's anti-androgen effect. \u00be Chronic exposure of adult animals leads to Leydig cell tumors and short term exposures during critical developmental periods could potentially lead to, for example, male reproductive tract malformations. \u0083 Acute dietary pesticide risk assessment was based on the most sensitive developmental effect noted following in utero exposure, ( e.g., decreased prostate weight, weight reduction in other sex organs, nipple/areolas development, and decreased ano-genital distance in male rats). Evaluates the human relevance of the laboratory animal findings. \u00be Antiandrogenic effects are expected in humans because the androgen receptor is widely conserved across species. \u00be The IPCS/ILSI Human Relevance Mode of Acti on/Human Relevance Framework Approach is a valuable tool for establishing modes of action and evaluating species differences. See http://www.who.int/ipcs/methods/harmonization/areas/cancer_mode.pdf \u0083 As discussed in Kavlock and Cummings, (Critical Reviews in Toxicology, 35 :721-726, 2005) there are data that show it is likely the vinclozolin will be metabolized in humans to its two more active metabolites, and as demonstrated in vitro , and that the two metabolites can bind to recombinant human androgen receptor (AR) and block the AR binding to the DNA response element. Ecological Risk Assessment Illustrates the importance of considering multiple lines of evidence across taxa. \u00be Adverse reproductive effects to mammalian and avian species resulting from exposure to vinclozolin and/or its metabolites appear related to its anti-androgenic activity found in vitro and in vivo studies. Identifies important information gaps in better characterizing the adverse consequences of vinclozolin's anti-androgenic activity in certain taxa . The lack of a full life cycle reproductive study in fish and an aquatic invertebrate life cycle study are considered important data needs because of reproductive effects found in other taxa. \u00be For example, in a modified fathead minnow ( Pimephales promelas ) were exposed for 112 conditions to 0.12 mg total vinclozolin residues/L [vinclozolin, metabolite B (acid), and metabolite E F 0-generation t he number of spawns/female was statistically-reduced and the number of eggs/spawn was notably higher in the vinclozolin treatment group. In the F 1-generation hatch survival was statistically-reduced both at ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 153 the start and end of hatch compared to controls. Because only one concentration was tested, the study could not be used to define a NOAEC and/or LOAEC. Results from the US Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) Assay Development and Validation Program Results observed in the EDSP Tier 1 studies (found at http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/oscpendo/pubs/assayvalidation/status.htm .) confirm vinclozolin's anti- androgen activity. The EPA risk assessment described above is consistent with the findings from the EDSP Tier 1 assays. In the EDSP Tier 1 fish study, male secondary sex characteristics, testicular degeneration, and male gonad weight and GSI were the most robust and sensitive endpoints which would be consistent with vinclozolin's activity as an AR antagonist. Vinc lozolin was also positive in the rat Hershberger assay which is designed to detect androgen antagonists and agonists. In the rat male pubertal assay, vinclozolin showed a profile expected for an anti-androgen ( e.g., delayed puberty, testicular histopathology, and epididymis weight as well as increases testosterone at higher doses). ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 154 Appendix 9 Contribution from BIAC ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 155 BIAC Perspective on a Globally Harmonized Approac h for the Evaluation of Endocrine Activity of Chemical Substances December 2008 1. The chemical industry is committed to providing chemicals that can be manufactured, transported, used and disposed of safely. The industry is also committed to making health, safety, environment and resource conservation critical considerations for all new and existing products and processes. In alignment with Responsible Care\u00ae, the member companies of chemical industry associations seek to understand risks posed by products throughout their life-cycle and to have systems in place to manage those risks effectively and appropriately in line with the shared re sponsibility with downstream users. Consistent with that commitment to Responsible Care\u00ae, the chemical industry recognizes the public's concerns that exposure to small levels of man-made and naturally occurring chemicals in the environment may pose a risk to humans and wildlife. 2. The chemical industry will continue to work together with government, the scientific community and other stakeholders to better understand the science related to the endocrine disruption issue. Through ongoing participation in the OECD EDTA, industry has contributed, and will continue to contribute, to the development, standardization and validation of new and revised OECD endocrine screens and tests. Internationally harmonized OECD Test Guidelines based on scientifically validated test methods must form the core foundation for screening substances for the potential to interact with components of the endocrine system and for such substances which have such a potential, for testing these materials to understand the dose-response relationship for production of adverse effects. 3. The chemical industry supports the development of internationally harmonised procedures to prioritise substances efficiently, to screen for endocrine activity, to test for adverse effects and to evaluate substances in the framework of a coherent chemicals policy. These procedures should provide for a tiered, hierarchical scientific framework in which validated screening assays are used to identify substances with endocrine activity and prioritise substances for further, more definitive testing. Definitive testing, using validated, harmonised protocols, is necessary to identify adverse effects caused by alterations to endocrine system function. Using a tiered approach, results from definitive tests must outweigh or supersede results from screening assays in guiding policy and management in both the public and private sectors. Definitive tests are necessary for hazard and risk characterization. 4. For hazard characterization, the chemical industry supports the development of a \"weight of evidence\" evaluation process that consists of a comprehensive, objective, transparent and balanced interpretation of the totality of scientific evidence regarding hormonal activity and adverse effects that might result from an endocrine mechanism. A defensible hazard characterization for hormonally active chemicals requires not only summarizing toxicological screening and testing data (hazard identification), but also requires an objective weight of evidence evaluation of whether the effects produced are adverse and whether adverse effects are due to a hormonal activity of the chemical. 5. The chemical industry supports the development of a globally harmonized approach concerning the interpretation of endocrine screening data, integration of screening data with definitive testing data and use of such data in prioritization, hazard characterization and risk assessment. Screening assays are to be used to prioritize substances for subsequent definitive testing. The results of definitive tests will provide data on adverse effects and dose response for use in hazard characterization and risk assessment. To perform risk assessments based on screening results would be an ina ppropriate use of the data. As the OECD finalizes test method validation and adopts endocrine Test Guidelines, there is a pressing need for a globally ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 156 harmonized evaluative processes and framework because such assays will soon be deployed in the U.S. as part of the EPA's Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program and in Europe as part of REACH. Consistent interpretations of the same data from the same endocrine-specific Test Guidelines and consistent use of such information in hazard assessment are needed to uphold OECD's Mutual Acceptance of Data. 6. The chemical industry supports the development of overarching guidance, applicable to all OECD member countries to ensure uniform and consistent description of the results of endocrine screening assays as well as the appropriate application of a weight of evidence framework for use of screening and definitive testing results in hazard characterization and risk assessment. (For specifics on weight of evidence see Attachment 1 CEFIC EMSG weight of evidence paper). 7. A tiered, hierarchical scientific framework for Endocrine screening and testing provides the most efficient and effective approach to evaluating substances. In this hierarchical framework, OECD validated, internationally harmonized test guidelines are used to screen substances identifying those with the potential to interact with one or more components of the endo crine system, and prioritizing for further definitive testing. Definitive testing, using validated, harmonized protocols, is necessary to identify adverse effects caused by alterations to endocrine system function. Using a tiered approach, results from definitive tests must outweigh or supersede results from screening assays in policy and risk management. Results from in vitro and in vivo screening assays only indicate that a substance interacts with a component of the endocrine system through one mechanism. Such screening results do not provide evidence on whether that substance will cause adverse biological effects. The in vitro and in vivo screening assays do not represent either the biological complexity of the intact endocrine system of an organism or evaluate adverse effects. If results from screening assays suggest the potential for endocrine activity, longer term in vivo studies are necessary. In this case exposures will be evaluated in the complete and intact endocrine system encompassing critical life stages and processes. In addition, assessments will include measurements of adverse effects, in order to fully characterize dose response of the potential endocrine mediated adverse health effects upon the endocrine system and in other tissues or organs. 8. Experience has shown that arraying toxicity tests in a tiered framework, provides scientific rigour and flexibility to account for differing chemical toxicities and to address specific concerns associated with existing or anticipated exposures to specific chemicals. In this manner tiered testing focuses efforts to collect data where it is most needed, to promote screening of the greatest number of prioritized chemicals (or classes of chemicals) and, where indicated by specific toxicity results, to indicate which substances pose a particular concern and points to the specific, more complex, test that should be considered. Where scientifically supported, the use of chemical categories can also increase efficiencies in providing knowledge of potential biological activities of chemical substances. 9. The chemical industry agrees that chemicals should continue to be tested for adverse health effects of concern under chemical regulation laws, the OECD hi gh production volume chemical testing programme, REACH and pursuant to product stewardship activities of individual companies even as the development, standardization and validation of harmonized OECD test guidelines of screens and tests for endocrine activity proceeds. 10. The chemical industry has and will continue to co ntributing funding and expertise to national and international efforts to develop and validate in vitro and in vivo screening assays necessary to identify and prioritize chemicals that may interact with the endocrine system in humans and wildlife. The chemical industry has been and will continue to participate in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Endocrine Disrupter Testing and Assessment (EDTA) efforts to develop and validate endocrine screens and tests. The chemical industry members urge governments to take advantage of the OECD Task Force on EDTA's on-going efforts to standardise and validate the globally harmonised test guidelines prior to initiating new, routine screening and testing procedures for endocrine disruption. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 157 11. The chemical industry recognizes the benefits of international cooperation among all stakeholders in the validation of screening and testing methods to most efficiently use existing resources, to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, to minimize the use of laboratory animals, and to help ensure mutual acceptance of data that is essential for international harmonization. 12. The chemical industry agrees that further research and understanding provide a sound basis for more effective public policy. Additional research is necessary to increase our scientific understanding and determine if there are possible adverse effects in humans and wildlife via hormone-mediated processes from exposure to chemicals in the environment. As has been stated in the comprehensive International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry publication on endocrine disruption, J. Miyamoto and J. Burger (2003), \"It is too early to reach firm conclusions about whether human populations are seriously at risk from potential exposures to EAS, and further vigilance is clearly required. However, it is somewhat reassuring that after substantial research in the past decade, there have been no conclusive findings of low level environmental exposures to EAS causing human disease.\" 13. The chemical industry, on a global basis, coordinates the research of its members to maximize efficiency and effectiveness and prevent duplication of effort, in part through the Long-range Research Initiative (LRI). Working with academic and resear ch institutions and governments, LRI members in Europe, North America and Asia sponsor basic research on the potential of chemicals to interact with and affect the hormone system and cause adverse effects. LRI members have pledged to conduct research through an open and transparent process at institutions selected through a competitive peer-reviewed process. The results of this research will be made available to the public and acted upon by industry in a timely manner. 14. A tiered, hierarchical scientific framework is needed for screening and testing (Table 1). Validated screening assays are used to identify substances wi th endocrine activity and prioritise substances for further, more definitive testing. Definitive testing, using validated, harmonized protocols, is necessary to identify adverse effects caused by alterations to endocrine system function. Using a tiered approach, results from definitive tests must outweigh or supersede results from screening assays in guiding policy and management in both the public and private sectors. For discussion, three tiers are suggested. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 158 Table 1.

Such instances could include, for example, substances with low potency, minimal human exposure likely intermediates or substances manufactured in closed system, and limited potential for environmental release. This would serve to focus the more extensive testing only on substances that have high exposure potential. 15. Proposed OECD Stage 1: Initial Assessment The purpose of the proposed OECD Stage 1: Initial Assessment (Table 2) is to rapidly assess the universe of substances in order to recognize those substances where scientifically relevant data exist to permit more rapid prioritization and assessment. The OECD Stage 1: Initial Assessment will permit one to: Recognize those substances (a) where pertinent data do not exist and (b) have some likelihood of exhibiting the mode(s) of action, e.g., binding to the oestrogen or androgen receptors, that lead to the particular hazard(s), e.g., reproductive and developmental effects, targeted by the assessment. These substances should then be prioritized. Recognize those substances which do not take part or are very unlikely to take part in the mode(s) of action(s) that lead to the particular hazard(s) targeted by the assessment. This reduces the overall effort and size of the assessment program. These substances can be reconsidered should new and compelling information emerge ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 161 Table 2.

Molecular screening results All relevant studies All relevant studies ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 162 16. Review of available toxicological information is an important step. Current toxicology testing protocols provide much information about potential endocrine mediated toxicity. Endpoints indicating endocrine-mediated toxicities are present in current testing guidelines or are being developed: Endocrine-mediated cancer mechanisms are well known, and endpoints for these mechanisms are included in current cancer bioassays, Multigenerational and reproductive studies are de signed to examine all relevant windows of sensitivity; in utero , lactational and pubertal as well as periods of functional reproductive capacity in adults, Work is in progress via the OECD Endocrine Di sruptor Testing and Assessment Task Force to review and where appropriate change/introduce screening and testing protocols. 17. For priority setting purposes, the totality of scientific evidence regarding hormonal activity and adverse effects that might result from an endocrine mechanism should be considered. This should include: assessment of existing regulatory actions; existing data on adverse effects; the presence or absence of response in different taxa; the nature and magnitude of positive responses in relation to the relevance & reliability of the assays; dose response (or lack thereof); repeatability; relative potency; and coherence of responses across assays in relation to the postulated mode of action. In cases where the weight of evidence indicates no, or at most very low, hormonal potency and there is little or no likelihood of release to the environment or potential for exposure, then such substances should be given a very low priority for further investigations. 18. Structure activity relationships ((Q)SARs) and molecular screening methods, where the model predictions can be validated, would permit the rapid assessment of specific, targeted mode(s) of action. For example, a relevant property for an oestrogenic mode of action is to bind to an oestrogen receptor. The volume and nature of the oestrogen-binding site determines a substance's ability to bind to the receptor and the actual binding affinity. (Q)SARs and molecular screening assays can then assist in the prioritization of substances with predictions of binding affinity and can also indicate a large number of substances where binding to an oestrogen receptor is highly unlikely. 19. Prioritization should include an integrated evaluation of several attributes such as: the possible potency of the substance as indicated by initial structural activity assessments; production volumes; the amount of environmental releases and the environmental levels indicated by monitoring; environmental properties such as long-range transport, persistence and bioaccumulation; use as related to the number of persons exposed, the relevance of the route of exposure, the intensity and duration of exposure, and possibility for disproportionate exposure in subpopulations; and weight of evidence evaluation of existing data. 20. Proposed OECD Stage 2: Screening. The purpose of the Proposed OECD Stage 2 Screening is to efficiently and effectively develop information as to whether a substance has the potential to interact with one or more components of the endocrine system. Most often OECD Stage 2: Screening assays are based on a particular mode of action especially ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 163 leading to relevant biological responses. A positive mechanistic response warrants further evaluation and, if necessary, testing to characterize relevant hazard(s), if any, connected with the mode of action. 21. The proposed OECD Stage 2: Screening (Table 3) is subdivided into in vitro assays and in vivo assays as these assays are not equivalent. Both economy and animal welfare considerations argue that in vitro assays be employed both to accommodate a significant number of compounds and to avoid undue delays in assessing substances. For flexibility, the option to proceed directly to in vivo assays should not be precluded, nor should in vitro assay results be required if in vivo results are available. In vivo assays incorporate i) substance-specific complexities that cannot be obtained from in vitro assays, including absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, and ii) reflect the complex and dynamic homeostasis and operation of the intact endocrine system. Therefore, in vivo results would supersede in vitro results as noted by the Veldhoven workshop (SET AC Europe 1997). Examples of in vitro assays for an oestrogen mode of action include: oestrogen receptor-binding assays, yeast strains containing a hormone receptor and a hormone responsive reporter gene, or mammalian cell lines naturally expressing the oestrogen receptor that are transfected with a reporter gene controlled by an oestrogen receptor.1 An example of an in vivo screening assay is the uterotrophic assay for an oestrogen mode of action. The assay is based on the growth and weight increase response of the uterine target organ, can be conducted in 3 days, and uses a minimum number of animals. The response of the uterine target-organ is highly relevant for the oestrogen mode of action. 1 Mammalian cell lines transfected with both a receptor and a reporter gene may have patent protection and their use therefore may be restricted.

Proposed OECD Stage 2: Screening Assays to Evaluate the Potential of Substances to Interact with One or More Components of the Endocrine System * Remark: Depending on the situation a TG-407 would suff ice to establish a NOAEL in selected instances. Such instances could include, for example, substances with low potency, minimal human exposure likely intermediates or substances manufactured in clos ed system, and limited potential for environmental release. This would serve to focus the more extensive testing only on substances that have high exposure potential. 22. The principles for the consideration of assays into the screening level of the tiered framework are: Individual assays should be selected and the protocols designed to provide the necessary information in a resource efficient manner. That is, in addition to having the capacity to address the anticipated number of substances, the assays themselves should be simple, rapid, and economical.

The assay technique(s) should be within the competence and qualifications of the necessary laboratory resources. As the results from assays comprising the proposed OECD Stage 2: Screening provide only mechanistic information and not evidence for adverse effects, such results should not be used for classification or regulation. In accordance with the Weybridge definitions (EC 1996), OECD Stage 2: Screening stage results do not indicate that a compound is an 'endocrine disruptor.' The TG407 has some utility as both a screening assay and definitive test. The TG407 has played a major role in the OECD SIDS battery as one of the leading repeat dose toxicity studies for commodity chemicals. The validation of the TG407 showed that only substances with strong or moderate endocrine activity were detected, especially as for weakly active substances, the overall study outcome was governed by general toxicity. In this respect, the TG 407 is a method evaluating some endocrine specific endpoints as well as apical endpoints, adverse effects and dose response, and can therefore be used in certain instances for hazard identification and characterization. As such, the TG407 would fall within the proposed OECD Stage3: Definitive Testing. However, as described in the newly i ssued TG407 OECD Test Guideline, there are some strengths and limitations inherent in employing the TG407 as either a screening assay in the proposed OECD Stage 2: Screening step or as a test for adverse effects in the proposed OECD Stage3: Definitive Test step. In a comparison of TG407 to higher tier studies, with regard to the observed overall (i.e., irrespective of the type of toxicity) No Adverse Effect Levels, the difference in sensitivity is usually not more than a factor of 10 (Gelbke et al ., 2007). Depending on the exposure situation a TG 407 may suffice for the proposed OECD Stage3: Definitive Testing for human health hazard characterization in selected instances. Such instances could include, for example, substances with low potency, confined intermediates, minimal human exposure, and limited potential for environmental release. Reliance on the TG407 in such cases for human health hazard characterization would serve to focus the more extensive testing only on substances that have high exposure potential 23. The screening assays comprising Stage 2: Screening focus on detecting estrogenic, androgenic and thyroid modes of action. To effectively screen chemicals with unknown endocrine activity, evaluation would consist of laboratory studies of the chemical in the complete battery of assays that comprise the proposed Stage 2: Screening step. If information from existing assays or functionally equivalent test methods is available that allows one to reach a scientifically sound conclusion regarding the activity of the substance with respect to one or more of the modes of action encompassed in the proposed Stage 2: Screening step, then those assays for such modes of action would not necessarily need to be run for such a substance. 24. A weight of evidence process needs to be implemented in order to integrate results across the complement of assays that comprise the proposed OECD Stage 2: Screening step. . Substances which are positive based on overall consideration of the weig ht of evidence in OECD Stage 2: Screening are considered to be high priority candidates for further evaluation in definitive tests (OECD Stage 3: Definitive Testing). However, there is not an automati c triggering. Instead, a weight of evidence approach (see Attachment 1, CEFIC EMSG Weight of Evidence paper) should be used to evaluate results of screening battery. Prior to initiating additional work, it is appropriate to consider the potential for human exposure and potential for entrance into the environment. The weight of evidence evaluation should include: the presence or absence of response in different taxa; the nature and magnitude of positive responses in relation to the relevance and reliability of the assays; dose response (or lack thereof); relative potency; and coherence of responses across assays in relation to the postulated mode of action. In additi on, as indicated above, in cases where the weight of evidence (derived from consideration of results of ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 166 validated screening assays) indicates at most very low potency and there is little or no likelihood of release to the environment or potential for exposure, then such substances should be given a very low priority for further investigation in definitive tests. Existing inform ation and data from standard toxicity studies (e.g., Repeat Dose Study (TG 407 and TG 408), Developmental Toxicity Study (TG 414; TG 421/422), Chronic Toxicity Study (TG 452 and 453)) should be reviewed as part of the weight of evidence evaluati on. Results from these studies can provide important information on dose response and adverse effects on endpoints of potential concern. The term 'potential endocrine disruptor' could be easily misinterpreted, and generally use of this term should be avoided. From a scientific perspective, it is important to determine the overall weight of evidence of the performance of a substance in the screening assays/battery, as described above. 25. Proposed OECD Stage 3: Definitive Testing The purposes of the proposed OECD Stage 3: Definitiv e Testing are to accurately and effectively identify and characterize the hazard(s) from chemicals. The tests comprising the proposed OECD Stage 3: Definitive Testing has been specifically developed to assess reproductive and developmental toxicity. The results obtained should be assessed relative to target site toxicity, and the endpoints evaluated include both endocrine and non-endocrine toxic endpoints. The array of tests included in Table 4 should be viewed as a matrix of available options, and not as a sequential list of assays and tests. It would not be necessary to conduct all tests, but instead, from this matrix, the appropriate test could be selected. In the interests of flexibility and minimizing animal and resources, for example the enhanced repeat dose study and the shorter-scope reproduction/developmental tests would not be required in cases where a longer scope test is already available or planned.

A defensible hazard characterization for hormonally active chemicals requires not only summarizing toxicological screening and testing data (hazard identification), but also requires an objective evaluation of whether the effects produced are adverse and whether adverse effects are due to a hormonal activity of the chemical. Hazard characterization is based on overa ll consideration of the weight of evidence. This includes consideration of the proposed OECD Stage 2 Screens and proposed OECD Stage 3 Definitive Tests, and results from standard toxicity st udies (e.g., Repeat Dose Study (TG 407/408), Reproduction/Developmental Toxicity Study (TG 414/421/422), Chronic Toxicity Study (TG 452/453) etc). Such an evaluation provides the context for considering adverse effects across organ systems and modes of action and for comparing NOAELs. However, hazard identification is insufficient to characterize risks. 27. Risk characterization requires integration of scientific data and knowledge of hazard, dose-response and exposure, as well as an evaluation of the foundations of the hazard data, inferences drawn from the data, and inherent uncertainties. In cases of low potency and low or negligible actual and potential exposures, test methods such as the Repeat Dose Study (TG 407) or the Reproduction/Developmental Toxicity Screening Tests (TG 421/422) could be used to provide dose-response data of effects on apical endpoints. This would serve to focus the more extensive testing only on substances that have high production volume and the highest potential for human and ecological exposures. In all cases, results from Stage 3: Definitive Testing outweighs or supe rsedes results from Stage 2: Screening. 28. In developing the OECD framework for evaluating endocrine activity, all have recognized the need to employ the OECD must use standardized, validated and internationally harmonized test methods, and this has been the foundation of the OECD EDTA and WNT wo rk over the past 10 years. In considering the screens and tests for evaluating endocrine activity, the OECD EDTA determined that certain types of studies were not standardized and lacked adequate data for a validation determination. Hence, the OECD EDTA formed the validation management groups to coor dinate the necessary laboratory studies to achieve standardized and validated test methods. Considerable progress has been made in this regard, due to the efforts of industry, government, academia and laboratories. 29. Research laboratory studies using novel test me thods, non-standardized, and not yet validated methods and / or non-standard test species generally lack the quality criteria that typically encompassed in studies employed using OECD Test Guidelines and Good Labor atory Practices, and thus such novel methods or non-standard test species must be evaluated with due caution for regulatory purposes. As basic research of endocrine mechanisms advance, new and novel scientific methods have, and will continue to be reported. These new and novel types of studies are significantly different from laboratory studies using standardized and validated techniques. For example, they may lack appropriate documentation for reliability of the test method performance or unambiguous interpretation of the relevance of the endpoints evaluated. Thus, such novel research studies should not be used for regulatory action, but should trigger further research and/or method validation efforts. 30. Validation of a test method is a required prerequisite for it to be considered for regulatory use. For a new or revised test method to be considered validated for regulatory purposes it should meet the criteria specified by OECD GD 34 (2005) and/or ICCVAM (1997)). For validation, the extent of a test method's variability and reproducibility within and across laboratories must have been demonstrated, and sufficient data provided to permit assessment of the method's range and limitation of application. 31. The issues of GLP, quality assurance and quality control have important international dimensions, as recognized by OECD. Under Mutual Acceptance of Data, regulatory authorities in OECD member countries can rely on safety test data developed abroad, thus eliminating duplicative testing, and this serves to both enhance laboratory animal welfare and to create testing efficiencies while at the same time assuring high quality scientific information is developed for regulatory and product stewardship purposes. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 169 Screening and testing of substances using validated test methods yields greater confidence in results compared to studies performed using non-validated methods. The requirement across OECD member countries of mutual acceptance of data is based on the foundation that evaluations of chemicals are based on test data of sufficient quality, rigour and reproducibility. 32. As scientific methods advance, regulatory bodies will continue to be challenged to review and interpret new and novel methods and studies with non-standard species. The responsible standard when dealing with results from such studie s, whose findings may be especially influential, is the standard which is embodied in the scientific method - hypothesis form ulation, hypothesis testi ng through experimentation, and independent replication. The OECD EDTA Framework should endorse and integrate this responsible standard concept into the OECD globally harmonized ap proach for evaluation of the endocrine activity of chemical substances 33. New and novel methods, and studies with non-stan dard species, may provide important scientific information. Recognizing this fact, we suggest the fo llowing course of action for addressing such study reports. The first order task should be a thorough review of the study report. This would entail independent review of the methods and procedures and review of the data. The study documentation should be sufficient to permit independent verification/calculation of results, and the methods should be sufficiently described to permit replication of the stu dy procedures by other laboratories. Following this review, it is recommended that an additional laboratory replicate the study. Then, if the findings are shown to be reproducible, then two courses of action would be advised: A) The new or novel test method could be subjected to standardization and validation within the OECD TG program (EDTA) or within a similar formal program sponsored by a national government or recognized scientific organization (e.g., ISO, ASTM), provided that such a method is viewed as necessary to augment or replace one or more existing test methods in the screening and testing battery. International harmonization should also be an objective, to promote mutual acceptance of data and to optimise utilization of laboratory animals. To the extent possible, in a manner similar to that of the OECD EDTA, it is beneficial for lead organizations to undertake a certain amount of standardization and pre-validation work, and for information to be shared across sectors (government, industry, academic and other scientific researchers). Organization & conduct of the formal test method validation effort should be conducted within the existing processes of the relevant competent authorities; or B) The substance of concern could be evaluated in one of the wide variety of existing validated test method using standardized OECD TG methods and species (or similarly validated scientific methods, for example those promulgated by ISO, ASTM, US EPA). Results of this study would then be evaluated within the tiered hierarchical OECD EDTA Framework. In general, this would be the preferred course of action. 34. While review of the totality of relevant scientif ic information is needed for robust regulatory decision making, in regulatory reviews the weight afforded to results from standardized and validated test methods and laboratory studies conducted under GLP generally exceeds the weight given to novel and non- validated, non-GLP studies. Until such time as either course A or B in paragraph 33 is completed, it would be imprudent to initiate extreme risk management actions based upon a report of a new, novel or non- validated test method. Experience has shown that it is inappropriate to automatically accept novel and new research reports for regulatory purposes. At times, even peer review by scientific journals won't suffice to screen out flawed studies, a fact that should counsel against overly enthusiastic acceptance of any single study - especially one whose results are both extraordinary and groundbreaking. If the results of single studies seem especially important special care should be taken to verify the quality of such studies. It is also important to consider the scope of peer review. For the vast majority of scientific journal publications, peer reviewers in fact do not examine th e detailed laboratory study records. Instead, this ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 170 system relies on the submitting author's summarization of experimental procedures and results. If the results of single studies seem especially important special care should be taken to verify the quality of such studies. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 171 REFERENCES J. Miyamoto and J.

CEFIC EMSG Paper: Towards the Establishment of a Weight of Evidence Approach to Prioritizing Action in Relation to Endocrine Disruption SUMMARY Large uncertainty still remains about actual risk posed by endocrine disrupting substances and the scientific assessments that should be included when developing risk management options. The position of CEFIC is that a weight of evidence approach using the most credible scientific data should be used in making decisions. A number of publications describe how to evaluate data quality and their use in hazard and risk assessment (e.g. Ref. 1 & 2). This document builds on this earlier work and summarises the key elements of a procedure to evaluate the balance of scientific evidence in relation to the potential of a substance to cause adverse effects through disruption of the endocrine system. It addresses the issues of data relevance, quality and significance - using a weight of evidence approach to indicate whether, and what action needs to be taken in order to assess the hazards and risks of a substance. It has been developed specifically to enhance the prioritisation process and output of the EU DG Environment project: \"Towards a Priority List of Substances for Further Evaluation of their Role in Endocrine Disruption.\" The procedure includes: A data collection step that covers a search of the published literature and an extension of the search into unpublished literature, particularly to gather data used for regulatory purposes. An evaluation step that considers: 1. What endpoint has been measured and the relevance of that endpoint to the effects of potential endocrine disruption mechanisms. 2. The repeatability, reliability and quality of a particular study and its protocol, together with the extent of peer review. 3. The significance (or 'weight') of the data based on the assessments under 1 & 2 above. 4. Whether there is sufficient coherence of the data to draw conclusions (balance of the 'weight of evidence') 5. What further evidence is required, including a prioritised action identification step leading to risk assessment in accordance with the existing, or any future coherent chemicals regulatory framework. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 173 INTRODUCTION The European Commission has completed the initial stages of a project through DG Environment to prepare a \"Priority List of Substances for Further Ev aluation of their Role in Endocrine Disruption.\" This exercise required the evaluation of toxicological data in order to achieve a prioritisation rating, but the Chemical Industry believes that the approach taken to create the initial list was too superficial to add meaningfully to the debate and that the list may be misinterpreted. The process to develop the list used an \"evidence of suspicion\" approach in which the presumption of endocrine toxicity may be based upon as little as a single data point. Studies showing consistently that there is no evidence of endocrine toxicity have been ignored, irrespective of quality, since they do not add to the strength of suspicion. Furthermore, the 'List' adds nothing to the debate beca use it fails to identify and incorporate the priority actions required to assess ED hazards and risks properly. It also fails to present a strategy for assessing all other substances for which there is little or no data to judge the ED hazard. It is merely another list of often poorly founded suspicions that, because of its apparent 'official' status and pseudo-scientific analysis, may be misinterpreted as a 'Definitive List of Endocrine Disrupters'. Failure to take all available data into consideration could well lead to economically dama ging de-selection of products without protecting human health or the environment. Despite these well founded concerns, the European Chemical Industry accepts the political desire to develop a list of priority substances for further evaluation of their role in endocrine disruption but believes that the interests of both public and environmental heal th would be better served if the 'List' was to be more 'action' orientated and based on sound scientific principles. Through this document, CEFIC offers an approach that weighs both the relevance and reliability of evidence in the balance using scientifically based criter ia to identify the priority actions required for each substance under suspicion and indeed, any other substance that may come under review - truly providing a priority action plan towards risk assessment with in the processes laid down under existing community regulations. We have termed this approach as the 'W eight of Evidence Approach' and it fits between an initial step to define a group of chemicals requiring evaluation and later steps to fill data gaps and undertake risk assessment. This is shown graphically in Figure 1 on the next page. At a European Union meeting in Weybridge (Ref. 3), the following definitions were agreed: \"An endocrine disrupter is an exogenous substance that causes adverse health effects in an intact organism, or its progeny, consequent to changes in endocrine function.\" \"A potential endocrine disrupter is a substance that possesses properties that might be expected to lead to endocrine disruption in an intact organism.\" These definitions have gained wide acceptance in the international arena, have been adopted by the International Programme for Chemical Safety (IPCS) and consequently, have been used as the basis for this set of proposals. In agreement with the aim of the European Commi ssion project, the procedure developed works towards prioritising actions required for the further assessment of substances in relation to their potential endocrine disrupting activity. In this context, the phrase 'consequent to' is interpreted to mean demonstration of a causal link between mechanistic activity and adverse health effects. It specifically addresses six potential mechanisms - agonistic and antagonistic effects on the oestrogen, androgen and thyroid systems. However, where relevant, it also makes provision for reporting non- endocrine adverse effects so that risks from other sources are not ignored.

It consists of the two basic tasks shown below: 2.1 Collecting the data. 2.2 An evaluation step that considers: 2.21 What endpoint has been measured and the relevance of that endpoint to the effects of potential endocrine disruption mechanisms (Data Relevance) . 2.22 The repeatability, reliability and quality of a particular study and its protocol, together with the extent of peer review (Study Repeatability) . 2.23 The significance (or 'weight') of a data set based on the assessments under 2.21 & 2.22 above (Data Significance) . 2.24 Whether there is sufficient coherence of the data to draw conclusions (balance of the 'weight of evidence'), what further evidence is required to take action and what that action should be. (Coherence, Gaps and Framework for Further Action) . Expert judgement is required at each stage and it is important to record the basis of decisions to aid transparency (See Section 3). It should be emphasised that none of these proposals are new. Such an approach is well accepted and documented in peer reviewed journals (e.g. Refs. 1, 2 and 4). 2.1 Data Collection In order to ensure that as many data as possible are included in the assessment, an extensive search of all relevant databases is required. This should capture any data available in SIDS, IUCLID and other relevant databases, as well as in the published literature. Criteria for the search and organisation of the search results should be based on expert judgement, and developed on a case-by-case basis, details of which should be recorded. (See Section 3). The literatu re search should, as a minimum, include those commercially available databases listed in Annex 1. Consideration should also be given to seeking unpublished literature, particularly data used for regulatory purposes - but only where the quality can be assessed under Section 2.23. 2.2 Data Evaluation 2.21 Data Relevance There are various assays, measures and toxicological endpoints that are claimed by different sources to be relevant to the assessment of endocrine disruption. In reality, this field is still in an early stage of development and there is uncertainty regarding the sign ificance of many of the findings, especially the relevance of in vitro assays and short-term screening assays to toxicological effects. A weight of evidence approach should be able to differentiate between various toxicological endpoints in relation to their relevance to mechanistic evidence and observed effects. For the approach described here, endpoint relevance has been weighted to enable a hierarchy which can differentiate between: Observed adverse health effects with mechanistic support to establish causal linkage Observed adverse health effects with limited understanding of mechanism ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 176 Biomarker of exposure Mechanistic potential with no observed effect Substances should only be considered endocrine disrupters if they cause \"adverse health effects in an intact organism, or its progeny, consequent to changes in endocrine function\" (Ref. 3). Hence, it is inappropriate to assess a substance as an endocrine disrupter on the basis of mechanistic in vitro assays alone and the approach has been designed to reflect this. Similarly, many current testing criteria exist for the in vivo determination of adverse effects on reproduction and/or development without providing evidence of mechanistic cause. Under these circumstances, a negative result may be sufficient to demonstrate that a substance is not en endocrine disrupter, but a positive result may need further testing to distinguish the mechanistic cause. Nonetheless, those with a financial interest in the substance may feel that it is more prudent and efficient to proceed directly towards risk assessment - rather than undertake additional testing - on the conservative assumption of an endocrine cause. For non-standard protocol endpoints, the assessment of endpoint relevance would in many instances be a subjective decision which should be based on sound expert judgement. If such a judgement proves impossible, then the data should be treated as being of 'low significance' (See Section 2.23) until such time that additional research is able to clarify the releva nce to risk for species known to be exposed to the substance in question. In all instances, the relevance rating would need to be clearly documented with appropriate justification. Adverse effects identified but thought to be of non-endocrine origin should be reported for further assessment by the relevant Competent Authorities. Assessing Relevance of In vivo Data The most relevant data for reaching an evaluation of endocrine toxicity is found from repeat dose toxicity and/or reproductive toxicity studies which include measurements and observations associated with endocrine toxicity. Other types of in vivo studies, including screening assays such as the uterotrophic and Hersberger assays do provide relevant information, and data from such studies should be included in the any weight of evidence review. It must be remembered that, positive results in screening assays are not conclusive evidence of adverse health effects and are of lower relevance than the repeat dose studies in making a judgement about endocrine disruption. Nevertheless in vivo screening assays do serve a useful purpose by indicating potential for harm and should be regarded as \"indicative studies\" leading to actions as indicated in Figure 2. A summary of the relevance of in vivo studies is shown in Table 1 Table 1: Relevance of In Vivo Assays High relevance endpoint(s) in a multi-generation test or other repeat dose toxicology test that is specifically controlled by the endocrine system, or parallel dose-responsive changes in hormone levels in the presence of consequent toxicological effects (mammalian only) negative data from a short term/screening assay specifically controlled by the endocrine system Medium relevance endpoint in a multi-generation test, or other repeat dose standard toxicology test, which may be influenced by the endocrine system, but is also known to be affected by other factors, e.g. water quality, environmental stress, toxicity etc.; or endpoint in a short-term/screening assay specifically controlled by the endocrine system; or ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 177 changes in hormone levels in the absence of any toxicological effects (mammalian only) Low relevance evidence indicates that the endpoint is not controlled by the endocrine system. Positive results of adverse effects should be reported for further risk assessment. Assessing the Relevance of In vitro Data The purpose of in vitro testing is basically to identify intrinsic endocrine modulation potential and determine potency relative to a reference hormone. For example, \"can a substance bind to a receptor?\" and \"what amount is required to produce an equivalent response to a natural hormone such as oestrogen?\". As the predictive ability of in vitro tests to detect effects in animals is, at best, uncertain it must be recognised that results from in vivo assays are more relevant for judging whether or not a substance will cause endocrine toxicity. Despite such limitations, in vitro tests can be reliable for detecting potential endocrine modulating activity per se and therefore are a useful tool in the overall context of endocrine toxicity testing. A number of in vitro screening systems are available which involve the interaction of chemicals with vertebrate steroid receptors. Although the number of in vitro assays for taxa other than mammals is limited, receptors, such as for oestrogen, androgen, and thyroid, and their essential roles are conserved across vertebrates. The endocrine systems of invertebrates are poorly understood. The role of oestrogen and other vertebrate hormones, if any, in invertebrates is unclear, and will not be further discussed here. It is recommended that the data review incorporates all available in vitro data, and that for the purposes of assessing the relevance of in vitro endpoints, attention should be focused on both a hierarchy of information and the quality of the particular measurement system: whether the assay is designed to indicate simple receptor binding potential or the more indicative receptor binding coupled with transcriptional activation. whether the assay is a cellular or subcellular assa y, which would be indicative of whether or not the endocrine receptor was likely to be exposed to metabolites of the parent compound. whether the assay examines relevant endocrine parameters such as steroid metabolism. On the basis of the above discussion, a hierarchy of in vitro endpoint relevance is proposed in Table 2. Table 2: Relevance of In Vitro Assays High relevance endpoint is based upon receptor binding potential coupled with transcriptional activation, whole cell or subcellular assay; or receptor binding potential in a whole cell assay assessment of steroid metabolism in a whole cell assay Medium relevance endpoint is based on receptor binding activity in a subcellular assay, or endpoint is based on cell growth or other endpoint not a direct measurement of receptor mediated activity endpoint of steroid metabolism in a subcellular assay Low relevance not applicable ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 178 It should be noted that the hierarchy is solely for the relevance of the endpoint, and is not indicative of the final weighting applied to the result. The weight of the evidence procedure is described in Section 2.23. 2.22 Study Repeatability An assessment of study repeatability takes into account: The extent to which protocols have been validated and the limits within which conclusions can be drawn The extent to which the toxicological endpoints are understood The extent of the historical database and the confidence that this provides Basic experimental design - adequacy controls; suitability of concentration range Exposure data - purity of test material, verification of exposure concentrations Test species - suitability, general health, environmental conditions Analysis of results - statistical validity of observed effects Transparency of the study report It is essentially, an assessment of the confidence one might have in being able to repeat the study and reproduce the results. Traditionally, toxicity work has been evaluated agai nst compliance with internationally recognised and validated standard protocols (e.g. ASTM, ISO, OECD). Such studies can be repeated with a high level of confidence. Evaluation of protocols for the determination of endocrine disruption is difficult, since standard protocols are not currently available for this specific area. Nonetheless, many of these standard tests shed light on the adverse effects likely to result from endocrine disruption and their results can be relied upon to provide useful evidence. Other, perhaps more novel protocols may produce endocrine-specific information, but their reliability needs careful evaluation. Proposed criteria for reported data are listed in Annex 2, and have been selected as criteria which are indicative of work which has been undertaken to a good standard of scientific practice. It is proposed that tests carried out in accordance with these criteria form a suitable basis for assessing substances, when combined with a weighting based on the relevance of the endpoint, as previously described in Section 2.21 On this basis, it is proposed that the hierarchy for st udy repeatability should be ranked as follows in Table 3: ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 179 Table 3: Hierarchy of Repeatability High Confidence of repeatability All criteria for the experimental design and conditions, and for reporting transparency are met full details of experimental method available and these indicate that studies have been carried out to an acceptable standard Medium Confidence of repeatability The main criteria for the experimental design and conditions, and for reporting transparency (see bolded points of attached Annex 2) are met some details of the experimental method are available which indicate that studies have been carried out to an acceptable standard Low Confidence of repeatability Insufficient information is available for the experimental design and conditions to determine reporting reliability Unreliable Analysis of the experimental design and conditions indicate that the study may be unreliable or not reported transparently. 2.23 Data Significance The final task in establishing the 'weight' that should be ascribed to any set of data takes into account both the 'Relevance' and 'Repeatability' of the data as evaluated in Sections 2.21 & 2.22. In effect, the 'weight' is measured as the level of significance that can be ascribed to a data set in reaching conclusions about endocrine disruption. As discussed above in vivo data from repeat dose/long term animal studies are the most important in hazard assessment. While in vitro information and data from in vivo screening studies are useful in making judgments about the presumption of hazard they are not currently linked directly to, or are predictive of adverse/toxicological effects associated with endocrine disruption. For these reasons in vivo data from repeat and chronic* st udies examining functional endpoints such as growth, reproduction and development dur ing critical life-stages are considered more significant in assessing the potential for adverse effects and making risk management decision than in vitro data. The latter can only provide information about one or two steps in a chain of events that may, or may not lead to health probl ems. At best, such results can be taken as being only 'Indicative'. * In this paper, the term 'chronic' is used for all studies of 28 days exposure or longer and reproductive investigations. This paper proposes 4 levels of significance that might be ascribed to a data set: High Significance Indicative Significance Low Significance Unusable These terms are used to calibrate the level of significance that can be placed on in vivo and in vitro data as described below: ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 180 Assessing The significance of In Vivo Evidence Table 4 displays the evaluation of 'Significance' for in vivo data and is based on the following basic principles: As tests for chronic effects are the most relevant, if the effects are of High Relevance, studies of Medium and High Reliability should be considered as of High Significance. As the overall significance of screening tests is lower than chronic tests, in vivo screening endpoints of High Relevance from studies of Medium and High Reliab ility should be considered as only of Indicative Significance. If the effects from a chronic study are of Medium Relevance, studies of Medium and High Reliability should also be considered as only of Indicative Significance. Screening studies of only Medium Relevance, but of Medium and High Reliability should be considered as of Low Significance and used merely as supporting information. Data from studies considered as of Low Reliability or as Unreliable should be considered as Unusable. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 181 Table 4: In vivo Data Significance Study Repeatability Endpoint Relevance Unreliable Low Medium High Chronic High Unusable Unusable High High test Medium Unusable Unusable Indicative Indicative Relevance Low Unusable Unusable Positive effects to be reported Positive effects to be reported Screening test High Unusable Unusable Indicative Indicative Relevance Medium Unusable Unusable Low Low Assessing The Significance of In Vitro Evidence Table 5 is based on the following basic principles for assessing the significance of in vitro studies; No in vitro study can be considered as being of High Significance. At best it can be only 'Indicative' of mechanistic potential. However, a negative result of 'Indicative Significance' would be sufficient to be definitive. Only studies meeting both a high reliability and a high relevance should be assessed as being of 'Indicative significance'. Studies with a medium reliability and a high relevance, or vice versa should be assigned a 'Low significance' - for support purposes only. Data from unreliable studies or those with low reliability should be considered as unusable. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 182 Table 5: In vitro Data Significance Study Reliability Endpoint Relevance Unreliable Low Medium High Receptor High Unusable Unusable Low Indicative Relevance Medium Unusable Unusable Unusable Low Metabolic High Unusable Unusable Low Indicative Relevance Medium Unusable Unusable Unusable Low Use of Significance Assessments Assessments of Significance are used in the process sh own in Figure 2 (to be found on the next page*). It shows a 2-step process to be applied to each mechanism and is based on the premise that only evidence of 'In Vivo High Significance' can be considered as being definitive in the 1st step. Any other in vivo data must be considered alongside in vitro data in the 2nd step as 'indicative' or as 'supporting' evidence only. It is only necessary to proceed to the 2nd step if the 1st step is inconclusive. * Underlying Premises and Assumptions for Figures 2 and 3 can be found in Table 6.

All evidence of less th an 'high significance - in vivo ' is considered as of 'screening value only' or as 'unusable'. If sufficient is known about appropriate dose ranges, then dose/response testing could be implemented immediately after screening, thus reducing the overall amount of animal testing required. The scheme assumes that OECD Tier 1 tests for the 6 mechanisms above will be available soon forscreening and that enhancements for multi-generati on testing to cover the relevant end-points will have been agreed and validated as an OECD Tier 2 Test soon after. Priority is shown in colour: Red for 'high priority' ; Blue for 'medium priority' ; Green for 'no further action'. 2.24 Coherence, Gaps and Framework For Further Action Once all relevant data have been evaluated for significance to all 6 mechanisms in accordance with the procedure outlined in Section 2.23, it should be possible to assign each substance to one of the right hand boxes in Figure 2 and to identify gaps in knowledge that need to be filled. Simplistically, if all of the data fall into one of the boxes described in Figure 2, the substance could be actioned as proposed in Figure 3 (see next page). For example, if all high significance chronic data fall into the top-right box of Figure 2, then taking this forward into Figure 3, the procedure proposes that there is no need for further action and the substance should be removed from the 'List of Priority Actions'. Alternatively, should all data available fall into the second box, then again, going forward to Figure 3, the recommendation is for urgent risk assessment. In the event that High Significance - in vivo dose response data covering the relevant end-points associated with all six mechanisms exists already, then it would be possible to jump directly to risk assessment without undertaking further testing. However, whilst th is may be sufficient to assess the risk, it may leave some ambiguity about the mechanism. Those with an economic interest in the substance should judge whether additional mechanistic evidence can provide added value. In the event that the available data can only shed li ght on some of the mechanisms, then it is recommended that gaps are filled initially using the OECD Tier 1 tests. This will then allow the Tier 2 tests to be designed to cover all the mechanisms of concern without unnecessary test complexity. In practice, many substances may be positive for some mechanisms and negative for others - leading to the actions shown. Furthermore, the data may not be coherent - even for studies that are considered to be of ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 185 high significance. Clearly, if there is only one 'odd' study among many of similar significance, then one would be able to draw a conclusion based on the 'bal ance of the weight of evidence'. However, if the balance is neutral or close to neutral, then it will be necessary to undertake additional high quality studies for one or more mechanism to draw definite conclusions.

Exclusion criteria should be incorporated into this record to explain why individual references were not considered for further examination. Decisions taken under Sections 2.21, 2.22 & 2.23 should be recorded and justified. Actions should be recorded for substances in accordance with Figure 3. The report would, of necessity, incorporate an extensive list of all data considered, coupled with an explanation, as described in Tables 1-5 and Fi gures 2 & 3, as to how the final conclusions and recommendations for action were obtained. CONCLUSIONS The European Chemical Industry recommends that the weight of evidence approach is included in the process to identify a Priority Action List. This will ensure decisions are made on a complete evaluation of information rather than on a partial assessment, such as the 'evidence of suspicion' approach, which really does little more than count \"positive\" studies. The inclusion of the weight of evidence approach introduces scientific rigour into the process for developing a Priority Action List. The actions proposed are specific and truly prioritised in terms of urgency. Furthermore, it provides a platform for evaluating a much larger group of chemicals for which little or nothing is known at the moment. While the procedure can be applied immediately to existing data, it will quickly become clear from the resulting analysis that there are many data gaps. Furthermore, there is a need to conduct research which will aid better assessment and management of endocrine disrupting chemicals. An important component of this research is in the area of testing methodology and the Commission is most strongly urged to provide much needed support for the OECD testing initiative. While improvements and enhancements of testing protocols will build a better understanding of endocrine toxicity it is nonetheless expected that endocrine disrupting chemicals can be addressed adequately within the current risk assessment/management framework with only minor adjustments to include any new knowledge or enhancements of testing protocols.

Basic experimental design There should be a minimum of three (usually five) test concentrations, ideally with one at a concentration expected to cause no response. Intervals between test concentrations should be less than one order of magnitude. Suitable controls should be included as well as the test concentrations, including a carrier control if a carrier solvent is used in the tests. All controls and treatments should be replicated. Top dose should show slight cytotoxicity 2. Other aspects of test procedure Source and/or purity of test material should be specified. 3. Analysis of results For a positive response, the results should norma lly show a concentration dependent response. Results should be analysed for confidence limits or statistical significance, and data presented to allow verification. Tests meeting all the above criteria have a high reliability. Tests meeting the criteria with bolded bullet points have a medium reliability. All other tests merit a low reliability or are unusable. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 190 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS OF RELIABLE in vivo LABORATORY STUDIES 1. Basic experimental design Top dose should be a maximum tolerated dose level for mammalian tests There should be a minimum of two (usually three) test concentrations for mammalian studies, and typically 3 to 5 concentrations in non-mammalian studies, ideally with one at a concentration expected to cause no effects. Suitable controls should be included as well as the test concentrations, including a carrier control if a carrier solvent is used in the tests. All controls and treatments should preferably be replicated for screening assays (necessity of this requirement may be assessed based upon complexity of the experiment, and may be considered extraneous, based upon expert judgement). Toxicity to the intact organism (animal) and any organ being used as an endpoint should be assessed 2. Measured concentrations Exposure concentrations should be analysed 3. Maintenance of test concentrations (non-mammalian studies only) Test concentrations should be maintained at reasonably constant levels. Flow-through aquatic studies are usually better at main taining test concentrations than static studies due to the regular replenishment of test substance(s). 4. Other aspects of test procedure The stocking density, or animal numbers, should be appropriate. The test should incorporate an appropriate feeding regime (where necessary). Extraneous sources of stress should be minimised ie. noise, lighting, vibrations. The test organism should be defined, and of a suitable age, sex and health. Use of incompatible materials in the test apparatus should be avoided. (If concentrations are analysed and control mortalities reported, this becomes less important). Purity and source of test material should be specified. 5. Peripheral data Peripheral test data should be measured and reported ie. for aquatic studies, pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature and preferably hardness, type of water. Analysis of diet(s) for potentially relevant contaminants (eg. PCBs). 6. Analysis of results Results should be analysed in the context of both concurrent and historical control data. ENV/JM/MONO(2010)3 191 Ideally the results should show a concentration dependent effect and the results should be analysed for confidence limits or statistical significance. Tests meeting all the above criteria have a high reliability. Tests meeting the criteria with bolded bullet points have a medium reliability. All other tests merit a low reliability or are unusable.

Prioritizing Chemicals for Endocrine Disruptor Tier 1 Screening: Effects EDSTAC recommended the use of measured or predicted receptor binding and/or transcriptional activation data derived through in vitro assays/High Throughput Screening (HTPS) and (Q)SARs, respectively. SAB/SAP in 1999 concurred, however, concluded that HTPS and (Q)SARs were not sufficiently developed at that time -encouraged continued research. As part of US EPA's computational toxicology and endocrine disruptor research programs, the Office of Research and Development (ORD), in collaboration with OPP and OSCP, has been developing in vitro assays, HTPS applications, and (Q)SARs. Priority Setting: First Chemicals to be Screened Selection based on potential human exposure. -Pesticide active ingredients: presence in food and water, residential use, and occupational contact. -High Production Volume inert ingredients detected in human and environmental monitoring. Selected chemicals found in multiple exposure pathways. Issued the final list of chemicals for initial screening 15 April 2009. -58 Pesticide active ingredients. -9 High Production Volume / pesticide inert ingredients. NOT a list of \"known\" or \"likely\" endocrine disruptors. 19 Future Prioritization for EDSP Tier 1 Screening Pesticide active ingredients - current plan is to use EPA's schedule for re-evaluat ing registered active ingredients in the Registration Review program, consistent with EDSTAC and SAB/SAP recommendations (http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/registration_review/) Inert ingredients and other chemicals - develop in vitro and in silico tools that are integrated with exposure-based metrics30-Sep-2009 6 21Evaluation for Relevant lC lC lC lC l C l C lO H O H O H C l C lO H C lC lC lC l C lC O H C2Cl 3C l C lC C l C lO H O H C l C lO HC lC lC lC lC lC lC l C l C lO H O H C l C lO H C lC lC lC l C lC l C lC lC lC lC l O H C l C lO H O H O H C l C lO H C l C lO H O H C l C lO H C lC lC lC l C lC l C lC lC lC lC l O H C l C lO HIn Vitro Profiling: Molecular interactions, Cellular ResponsesExisting Knowledge , exposure use, toxicity data, SAR, QSAR Efficient Focused In Vivo Testing Research: Learn and Refin ePriority Setting Process A (Q)SAR-Based System to Predict ER Binding Affinity Application for use in a prioritization scheme in the context of EDSTAC and SAB/SAP recommendations.

Mechanisms of action can take decades or more to elucidate. \u00beStill debate over how TBT causes imposex. \u00beDo not want a definition in legal text which would mean regulators having to prove an endocrine disrupting mec hanism of action - and that the effects seen were a direct consequence of this.2 Inclusion of the term 'adverse' effects in definition is not appropriate \u00beIn EU, REACH regulates chemicals with ED properties if evidence of probable serious effects. - pesticides with ED properties will be regulated if may cause adverse effects. \u00beTherefore, inappropriate to have a definition which would mean a chemical was only defined as an EDC if a higher level of proof was available to show it definitely caused adverse effects. Barrier to action if have to prove an EDC causes 'adverse' effects. \u00beDoes it mean adverse effects in humans and wildlife. If so, how to extrapolate with certainty from lab tests? \u00beIf it means adverse effects in lab animal - could preclude regulating on basis of in-vitro tests or on the basis of oestrogenicity identified in a uterotrophic assay - as some suggest increased wt of uterus is not 'adverse'. \u00beIf definition is too restrictive - it will effectively mean that no chemical is ever identified as an EDC. Issue 2: Use of non-OECD tests \u00beScientific knowledge develops all the time. Non-OECD test results must be considered. \u00beIndependent test results should undergo scientific peer review and be published.Regulators should decide how to weight such studies. \u00beShould not be necessary in all cases to repeat - nor to subject the method to a validation procedure - nor to evaluate the substance in an existing OECD test method. \u00beIndustry should bear responsib ility for assessing safety of their chemicals - but may be problems with bias. Need independent scientists & Government laboratories Issue 3: Identify sensitive species for use in tests \u00beImposex in wild - but st ill no OECD agreed TG. \u00beOECD now has mollusc draft Detailed Review Paper. \u00bePrioritise partial life cycle test with Potamopyrgus antipodarum. Optimisation and validation of SOP now! \u00beOther mollusc species need to be worked on. \u00beUrge Governments & industry to support this work.3 Issue 4: Address the complexity of the endocrine system \u00beCould current testing be done better ? \u00beNeed to move beyond attempts to validate a handful of narrowly focused assays. \u00beConsider a comprehensive assay - looking at all tissues and organs. Examined by experts in that part of the endocrine system. .. do not 'waste' the life of these laboratory animals, - but ensure TGs make best use of the animals that have to be sacrificed to identify harmful chemicals. Issue 5: If test on animals ... If Extended 1- Gen reproductive toxicity test is to be conducted... \u00beIt should be mandatory to include endpoints for developmental neurotoxicity immunotoxicity. \u00beAlso - include development. \u00beWhy not? Cost ? Or an unexpressed wish to avoid getting information which could identify chemicals with such worrying effects? Issue 6: Proposed testing batteries should make explicit their limitations \u00beOnly by making it more explicit where the known gaps are - will there be the necessary impetus to fill such gaps. \u00beExisting screens and tests are sufficient to say some chemicals have endocrine disrupting properties, but not sufficient to ensure a chemical is not an EDC.4 Issue 7: Take account of new insights \u00beHormones work at low concentrations \u00beSystem already 'off the base-line' \u00beLow dose effects may not be predicted by high dose testing \u00beNon monotonic 'inverted-U' or 'U' dose-response curves for EDCs do \u00beLUPRON - for prostate cancer and endometriosis TAMOXIFEN -for breast cancer.
