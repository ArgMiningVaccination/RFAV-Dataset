It goes back to indications given by Rudolf Steiner, and is one of the remedies for typical illnesses. It consists of the plants primula, onopordum and hyoscyamus, which undergo a special preparation: digestion is a pharmaceutical process employing the mild warmth of 98.6\u00b0 F, the mean temperature of the human blood. Primula veris (cowslip) supports the anabolic process of the heart through its sulfuric nature and has mild cardiac stimulating properties. Through this spring plant, the cosmic life force is gathered and led via the periphery into the living blood of the organism. Its point of therapeutic action is the periphery of the vascular system and the large surface area in the capillaries. Hyoscyamus (henbane) acts as a mediator between Primula veris and onopordon. This mid-summer plant's large, rhythmically undulating leaves show a strongly rhythmic structure. Rhythm, the swinging back and forth between two poles, is the uniting element between the capillaries at the periphery and the heart at the center; thus, it harmonizes the region of the arterial vasculature. Onopordum (Scotch thistle) supports the catabolic processes in the heart and stimulates its activity. This later summer plant overcomes the forces of the Earth through the forces of silica active in the thistle family and evident in the thorns. Onopordum's field of action extends to the heart, the deepest center point of the circulation, where the blood which has fallen away from the cosmic, etheric forces has to be renewed. Cardiodoron really addresses the interaction of the heart and the circulatory system, (e.g. the center and periphery). It's indicated for orthostatic circulatory disorders especially in pregnancy, puberty, Parkinson's disease, exhaustion during and following stress, particularly for inner restlessness, and vegetative dystonia with palpitations, cardiac arrhythmia, sleep disorders due to inner restlessness in the heart area and palpitations.
