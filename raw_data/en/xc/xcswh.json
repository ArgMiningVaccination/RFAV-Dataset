Chlorine or other chemical solutions once used cannot again be used for bactericidal treatment on any succeeding day. 3. Exposure in a steam cabinet equipped with an indicating thermometer, located in the coldest zon e, at a temperature of at least 180\u00b0F for at least 15 minutes, or to a temperature of not less than 200\u00b0F for 20 minutes. 4. Exposure to a properly designed oven or hot air cabinet equipped with an indicating thermometer, located in the coldest zone of hot air, at a temperature of at least 180\u00b0F for not less than 20minutes. 5.

In machine washing multi -use eating and drinking utensils are to be stacked in racks or trays so as to avoid over crowding and so as to permit the wash and rinse waters to reach all surfaces of each utensil. 3. Dishwashing machi nes must be kept clean.

The parts are to be readily accessible for inspection and clea ning. 23 4. The water in the wash tank shall be changed during operation as often as is necessary to keep it reasonably clean. An effective concentration of detergent in the wash water must be maintained at all times. 5. Where an installation does not provid e water at a temperature of 180\u00b0F in the rinse compartment of a dishwashing machine, a thermostatically controlled booster heater shall be provided to insure rinsing at the required temperature, or other method of sanitizing approved by the Chicago Departm ent of Public Health. 6.

Additional visit may become necessary if circumstances suggest variations from normal. These guidelines represent a consensus by the Committee on Practice and Ambulatory Medicine in consultation with the membership of the American Academy of Pediatrics through the Chapter Presidents. The committee emphasizes the great importance of continuity of care in comprehensive health supervision and the need to avoid fragmentation of care. A prenatal visit by the parents for a nticipatory guidance and pertinent medical history is strongly recommended. Health Supervision should begin with medical care of the newborn in the hospital.
