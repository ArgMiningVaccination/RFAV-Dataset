This knowledge is integrated with existing facts and theories in an instructional program for undergraduate, graduate and Extension audiences in a manner that builds human capital, fosters economic viability and improves the quality of life and the environment for our state, national and international clientele. Undergraduates can major in Animal or Poultry Science with emphasis in business, production systems, natural science, international agriculture or natural resources.

Recent Submissions - [The Potential Negative Effects of FGF-23 peptide Vaccination on the Hatchability of Fertilized Eggs](/handle/1793/78533)(2018-06-12)In Ren et al. (2018), fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) peptide vaccination increased eggshell quality of Single Comb White Leghorn laying hens. Increasing eggshell strength may have considerable benefits for egg ... - [Inactivity-induced phrenic motor facilitation is associated with decreased phrenic burstto- burst variability](/handle/1793/67889)(2012)Reduced respiratory neural activity in ventilated rats elicits rebound increases in phrenic discharge upon neural activity restoration, a plasticity called inactivity-induced phrenic motor facilitation (iPMF). We specialization of obligate (Cynomys spp.). Indeed, the extirpation of ferrets from the wild was attributed to the decline of prairie ... - [Light emitting diode effects on color stability of frozen beef](/handle/1793/48520)(2010)Effects of meat exposure to light (light emitting diode, LED; fluorescent) on color stability of air-bloomed and pure oxygen-bloomed fresh frozen beef steaks were determined. (CIE a*, C*) and reflectance ... - [Validation of the Combs-Goeser in vitro procedure to test if it improves repeatability and precision of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility measurements to allow improved near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy precise and accurate estimates of NDF digestibility (NDFD) are needed to better predict forage energy utilization by dairy cattle. Currently, NDFD measurement accuracy and repeatability are weak due to two ... - [Efficiency of dietary calcium use for skeletal growth and mineralization in young pigs fed diets with various phosphorus concentrations](/handle/1793/7959)(2007)Nutrient efficiencies are generally greater for animals fed diets with marginal deficiencies. In a preliminary study, however, Ca efficiency was lower in pigs fed diets with a marginal Ca deficiency (J Bone Miner Re 20:S193). ... - [Effects of white yolk concentration on maturation, fertilization, and blastocyst development of bovine embryos produced in vitro](/handle/1793/6695)(2004)Most in vitro embryo production (IVP) systems use some form of bovine sera in media. The most commonly used sera in maturation of bovine oocytes is fetal calf serum. A potential problem arising from "}
