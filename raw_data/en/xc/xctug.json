Supplements and revisions were made in the following Qin Dynasty ( 221-206 BC) and Han Dynasty (206 BC- 220 AD). This documentary heritage was further edited by the Imperial Bureau of Revising Medical Works of the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127), which was established in 2 nd year of Jiayou reign (1057) of the Renzong Emperor of the Northern Song Dynasty by His Royal order.

Since then this documentary heritage has b een preserved among other rare books in the Library without change of custody. Its authenticity is unquestionable. 4.2 World Significance, uniqueness and irreplaceability a) World Significance Huang Di Nei Jing is the most seminal and representative me dical work in written form for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). It summarizes the Chinese medical achieveme nts of thousands of years by incorporating theories, concepts and clinical experi ence into a coherent framework with standardized terminology that facilitate s understanding and continuous development. More im portantly it articulates a treasure of ancient knowledge on the natural way to health with detailed practical advice on preventive medicine, ways of preserving good health and methods of diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Compiled some 2,200 years ago, it laid down the foundation and inspired further development of TCM not only in China but also in its neighbouring countries and beyond. This documentary heritage is held as the provenance and origin of traditional medicine for Japanese Kampo medicine, traditional Korean medicine, Vietnamese medicine as well as the source of the more recent alternative medicine and therapy in the West. As early as the 6th to 10th Century, students from Korea, Japan and the Arab countries were sent to China to study science and technol ogy including medical sciences. Huang Di Nei Jing was their principle text, which was brought back to their countries for further dissemination. Huang Di Nei Jing has wide and far-reaching influence on th e research, development and application of TCM, contributing particularly to the maintenance of health and providing alternative treatment for different diseases. Since the middle of the last century, the book has been translated into many foreign languages, including English. It is considered the common spiritual wealth of mankind. The theoretical system of preventive medicine of TMC including th e visceral manifestations, channels and collaterals, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnostics and differentia tion of syndromes, the therapeutic methods and principles represented by acupuncture-moxibustion as we ll the use of herbal medicine based on this documentary heritage are recognized and applied in guiding TCM and its related practices all over the world. 5b) Uniqueness Huang Di Nei Jing is the earliest and the most comprehensive written work of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and a major classic of Taoist theory and life style dated back to some 2200 years ago. It is also the first medical text comprising innovative medical theory and practices and using standardized terminology that are still applicable. It departs from the old shamanistics beliefs that disease is caused by demonic influences but instead closely relates to diet, emotion, life style, environment, age and heredity. In short this documentary heritage has been regarded as the fundamental doctrinal source for TCM to this day. It has inspired research and study not only in TCM in Eastern Asian countries but also affects the grow th of alternative medicine and therapy in other parts of the world. The version nominated for inscription in the Memory of the World Register was printed in 1339. Its unique layout and classification reflects the ancient literary style and advance techniques in paper- making, bookbinding and woodblock printing of Chin a at the time. Further it is the only well- preserved authoritative version comprising the full set of documents still legible in spite of its age. c) Inreplaceability The original copy of Huang Di Nei Jing did not survive nor the version revised and edited by the Bureau of Revising Medical Works of the Northern Song Dynasty. Its best-preserved and most authoritative version is the one carved and printed in 1339 by the Hu's Gulin Sanctum, which is identical with the version revised by the Bureau of Revising Medical Works. The copy submitted for inscription in the Memory of the World Register is the authentic, the best preserved and most complete version of Huang Di Nei Jing extant. 4.3 Significance in time, place, people, form and style a) Time and Place Huang Di Nei Jing is the summary of medical theory and pr actices of China during the crucial historical periods which witnessed the establishmen t of traditional medical system in China and followed by its neighbouring countries and regions. This documentary heritage, traced back to some 2200 years ago, is the earliest, most systematic, and mo st complete ancient medical book of china. It is also the mother text of Traditional Chinese Medi cine that moulded the development of medical theories and practices in other East Asian count ries such as Japan, Korea and Vietnam. The medical model, theoretical system , treatment and therapy described in Huang Di Nei Jing are still applied in TMC today. They are also taken as usef ul references by conventio nal medicine. Moreover, the theory of preventive medicine an d health preservation put forth by Huang Di Nei Jing have become the subjects for research and development of modern medicine promoted by the World Health Organization. b) People Huang Di Nei Jing was compiled and revised by numerous Chinese physicians some 2200 years ago. Yellow Emperor (Huangdi) was held in the hi ghest regard as the pioneer and outstanding representative of Chinese ancien t science and technology and Oriental civilization. The name Huang Di Nei Jing (Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon) reflects the value and authority attached to the book. The 2 nd century BC was the critical time during which ancient Chinese civilization flourished with important progress made in arts, philosophy, me teorology, medicine, ge ography, phenology and agriculture. Huang Di Nei Jing expounds the concept of health with the philosophic thinking of Taoism and Confucianism. It reveals the ways of thinking, goals, living habits and customs of the 6society at the time; offering understanding not only in medical achievement but also many aspects of social and cultural development. This documentary heritage has been passed down successively through the carriers of bamboo slips, silk scrolls and paper and was officially blockprin ted by the government of the Song Dynasty between the 9th and 10th centuries AD. Since then it was re vised and edited, and reprinted over 50 times. It was also introduced to many Asian countries including Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. For example, it was stated at the earliest medical decree \"Dabao decree\" (701 AD) of Japan that Ling Shu (Miraculous Pivot) and Huang Di Zhen Jing (Yellow Emperor's Acupuncture Canon ) should be taken as the required textbook for all medical students. This do cumentary heritage has also been frequently and extensively cited in Japanese works such as Su Wen Yao Yu (Essential Phrases of Plain Questions) in 9 volumes, Ling Shu Yao Yu (Essential Phrases of Miraculous Pivot) in 8 volumes noted by TAKENAKA TUUAN in 1699, and the 12-volume Huang Di Nei Jing Jiang Yi (Explanation of Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon) written by KITAMURA KOUSOU in 1854. Su Wen Shi ( Records of Plain Questions) in 8 volumes and Ling Shu Shao Shi (Record of Miraculous Pivot Consciousness) in 6 volumes written by TANB A MOTOYASU in 1806 and Su Wen Shao Shi (The Continuous Records of Plain Questions) in 4 volumes compiled by TANBA MOTOKATA, the son of TANBA MOTOYASU, in 1846 are particularly well elaborated and explored. In 1091, Korea sent envoys to China and bro ught back several ancient medical works. Su Wen of Huang Di Nei Jing was listed as a compulsory textbook in their medical institutions in the year 1136. A large number of their medical works such as Xiang Yao Ji Cheng Fang (Collection of Formulry of Home Medicines) in 1433, Yi Fang Lei Ju (Classified Collection of Prescription) in 1445, and Dong Ui Bo Gam (Precious Mirror of Oriental Medicine) in 1613 all cited texts from Huang Di Nei Jing . As far as Vietnam is concerned, Hai Shang Yi Zong Xin Ling Quan Zhi ( Comprehension of Medical Tenet on the Sea) , written by Li Youzhuo and published dur ing the period of 1879-1885, is a large comprehensive medical book which includes the abridged annotation of Huang Di Nei Jing. In modern times, Huang Di Nei Jing also attracted the attention of th e medical circles of Europe and United States. In 1949, Dr. I. Veith (U.S.A) translated 34 chapters of Su Wen into English and published them under the title of Huang Di Nei Jing (Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon). Content of Huang Di Nei Jing was translated or quoted by European or American authors in many works, such as Alfred Forke from Britain in his book Zhong Guo Ren De Shi Jie Guan Tian Wen Yu Zhou He Wu Li Zhe Xue De Li Lun (The Theory of World View, Astronomy, Universe, and Physical Philosophy of the Chinese People) of 1925, in 1934 by the American William R. Morse in his book Zhong Guo Yi Xue (Chinese Medicine), and in 1925 by Percy M. Dawson in Su Wen-Zhong Guo Yi Xue Ji Chu (Plain Questions, the Fundamentals of Chinese medicine). In 2003, Dr. Paul Unchuld, Professor and Director of the Institute for the History of Medicine at Munich University published his famous work, Huang Di Nei Jing Su Wen : Nature, Knowledge, Imagery in an Ancient Chinese Medical Text, which gives a comprehensive survey and analysis of the conten t and influence of this milestone Chinese medical classic. Huang Di Nei Jing provides innovative theories and practices for many aspects of medicine, hygiene and health-care. It is an important text for researchers and physicians from different parts of the world and its influence is across time and territories. Anyone who learns, practises or receives treatment from traditional Chinese medicine has benefited from the wisdom of this remarkable classic. c) Subject and Theme Huang Di Nei Jing documents the medical accomplishment of China before the 2nd century BC. Based on the theoretical basis of Yin-Yang, Qi an d the Five Elements (or phases), it provides a comprehensive and systematic summary of the rela tionship between physical and mental activities and the pathological changes in the human body; coveri ng a wide scope of internal medicine, surgery, gynaecology, paediatrics a nd infectious diseases. 7Huang Di Nei Jing is the first medical text which departs from the old shamanistics beliefs that disease is caused by demonic influences. It expounds the concept of health with the philosophic thinking of Taoism and Confucianism. It sees diseases closely related to diet, emotion, life style, environment, age and heredity. Emphasis is placed on the unity of man and nature, and the holistic idea of body and mind. Accordingly, human activities should be in conf ormity with the regular changes of the nature, including climatic changes of the 4 seasons, alterna tion of day and night, and the cyclic phases of the moon. At the same time, emotions should be adjusted and desires restrained with ethnical considerations given that high moral value is an essential element of self-control to minimize the consumptive injuries brought to the body and mind. The book discusses the principles and prescribes methods of diagnosis and treatment of diseases in the realms of the visceral organs (Zang and Fu), channels and collaterals, pathogenesis, diagnostics, acupuncture and moxibustion, herbal medicine, etc. A large number of 'modern' diseases such as malaria, gout, diabetes, coronary heart disease, rheumatic arthritis, cerebrovascular problems are mentioned in the book with detailed analyses and treatment methods. Before Huang Di Nei Jing , there is no comprehensive written work on Chinese medical theory but primarily practical treatment and applications ha nded down by words of mouth or acquired through practical experience. Huang Di Nei Jing therefore could be seen as the pioneer which aims to combine medical theory and practices within a wider cosm ogonic framework in establishing a coherent system for medical science. As a result, this documentary heritage beco mes the cornerstone for Traditional Chinese Medicine and the standard for future learni ng. Its theories and practices have guided not only the development of traditional medicine in China, its neighbouring countries and beyond for centuries, it also has huge influence on the growth of alternative medicine and holistic therapy worldwide. Apart from offering a better understanding of the roots of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Huang Di Nei Jing reflects the dominant values and social goal s of ancient Chinese society. The book is invaluable to those who are interested in learning abou t the cultural and intellectual past of China. d) Form and style i) Form The nominated copy is printed on ancient Chinese pape r in the size of 20.4 cm \u00d7 12.4 cm with 14 lines in each page carrying 24 characters per line.

It is also an outstanding and rare example showing the ancient woodblock printing techni que in China dated 13th and 14th century. ii) Style The book is written in an interlocution pattern, w ith Yellow Emperor raises questions on medical issues and his sage physicians Qibo and Leigong answer by explaining medical theories and principles with illustrations of clinical experience and prac tices.
