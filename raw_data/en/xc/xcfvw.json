A B S T R A C T Background Mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) are serious diseases that can lead to potentially fatal illness, disability and death. Ho wever, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resu ltant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persist s, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness. Objectives T o assess the effectiveness and adverse effects associated wit h the MMR vaccine in children up to 15 years of age. Search methods For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Co ntrolled T rials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group' s Specialised Register, PubMed (July 2004 to May week 2, 2011) and Embase.com (July 2004 to May 2011). Selection criteria We used comparative prospective or retrospective trials asses sing the effects of the MMR vaccine compared to placebo, do nothing or a combination of measles, mumps and rubella antigens on healt hy individuals up to 15 years of age. Data collection and analysis T wo review authors independently extracted data and assesse d methodological quality of the included studies. One review a uthor arbitrated in case of disagreement. Main results We included ve randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one control led clinical trial (CCT), 27 cohort studies, 17 case-control studies , ve time-series trials, one case cross-over trial, two ecological stu dies, six self controlled case series studies involving in all about 14,700,000 children and assessing effectiveness and safety of MMR vaccine. Based on the available evidence, one MMR vaccine dose is at least 95% effective in preventing clinical measles and 92% effective i n preventing secondary cases among household contacts. Effectiveness of at least one dose of MMR in preventing clinical mumps in children is estimated to be between 69% and 81% for the vaccine prepared with Jeryl Lynn mumps strain and between 70% a nd 75% for the vaccine containing the Urabe strain. Vaccination 1 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.with MMR containing the Urabe strain has demonstrated to be 73 % effective in preventing secondary mumps cases. Effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR in preventing laboratory-conrmed m umps cases in children and adolescents was estimated to be betwe en 64% to 66% for one dose and 83% to 88% for two vaccine doses. We did not identify any studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR in preventing rubella. The highest risk of association with aseptic meningitis was o bserved within the third week after Urabe -containing MMR (risk ratio (RR) 14.28; 95% condence interval (CI) from 7.93 t o 25.71) and within the third (RR 22.5; 95% CI 11.8 to 42.9) or fth (RR 15.6; 95% CI 10.3 to 24.2) weeks after immunis ation with the vaccine prepared with the Leningrad-Zagreb stra in. A signicant risk of association with febrile seizures and MMR exposure during the two previous weeks (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15) was assessed in one large person-time cohort study invol ving 537,171 children aged between three months and ve year o f age. Increased risk of febrile seizure has also been observed in chi ldren aged between 12 to 23 months (relative incidence (RI) 4.09; 95% CI 3.1 to 5.33) and children aged 12 to 35 months (RI 5.68; 95% CI 2.3 1 to 13.97) within six to 11 days after exposure to MMR vaccine. An increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six week s after MMR immunisation in children aged 12 to 23 months was assessed in one case-control study (RR 6.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 30.1) and in one small self controlled case series (incidence rate ratio (IRR ) 5.38; 95% CI 2.72 to 10.62). Increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR exposure was also assesse d in one other case-control study involving 2311 children and adoles cents between one month and 18 years (odds ratio (OR) 2.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7). Exposure to the MMR vaccine was unlikely to be associa ted with autism, asthma, leukaemia, hay fever, type 1 diabet es, gait disturbance, Crohn's disease, demyelinating diseases , bacterial or viral infections. Authors' conclusions The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studi es, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate. Th e evidence of adverse events following immunisation with the M MR vaccine cannot be separated from its role in preventing the ta rget diseases. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Using the combined vaccine for protection of children again st measles, mumps and rubella Measles, very dangerous inf ectious diseases which cause severe morbidity, disability and death in low-income countries. Based on the evidence provided by three cohort studies (3104 par ticipants), vaccination with one dose of MMR vaccine is at least 95% effective in preventing clinical measles among preschool childr en; in schoolchildren and adolescents at least one dose of MMR va ccine was 98% effective in preventing laboratory-conrmed measles ca ses; one or two MMR doses were respectively 92% and 95% effectiv e in preventing secondary measles cases. At least one dose of MMR vaccine is effective in preventing clinica l mumps among children and adolescents when prepared with Jery l Lynn strains (vaccine effectiveness = 69% to 81%, one cohort and on e case-control study, 1656 participants), as well as when prepare d with Urabe strain (vaccine effectiveness = 70% to 75%, one cohort a nd one case-control study, 1964 participants). Effectiveness aga inst laboratory-conrmed mumps in children and adolescents was esti mated to be between 64% to 66% for one and 83% to 88% for two doses of Jeryl Lynn MMR 1664 participa nts) and 87% for Urabe-containing MMR (one cohort study, 48 participants). Vaccination with Urabe MMR confers protection aga inst secondary mumps infection (vaccine effectiveness = 73%, one cohort study, 147 participants). We identied no studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR va ccine against clinical or laboratory-conrmed rubella. Results from two very large case series studies involving abo ut 1,500,000 children who were given the MMR vaccine containing Urabe or Leningrad-Zagreb strains show this vaccine to be associ ated with aseptic meningitis; whereas administration of th e vaccine containing Moraten, Jeryl Lynn, Wistar RA, RIT 4385 strains i s associated with febrile convulsion in children aged below ve years (one person-time cohort study, 537,171 participants; two self co ntrolled case series studies, 1001 participants). The MMR vaccin e could also be associated with idiopathic thrombocytopaenic pu rpura (two case-controls, 2450 participants, one self controlled case series, 63 participants). We could assess no signicant association between MMR immunisa tion and the following conditions: autism, asthma, leukaemi a, hay fever, type 1 diabetes, gait disturbance, Crohn's disease, d emyelinating diseases, or bacterial or viral infections. The methodological quality of many of the included studies made it difcult to gene ralise their results. 2 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The glossary of study designs is available in the full-text re view. B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) are serious diseases that can lead to potentially fatal illnesses, disabilities and deat h. MMR are particularly prevalent in low-income countries where vaccinatio n programmes are inconsistent and the mortality rate from dise ase is high. However, in high-income countries MMR are now rare, due to large-scale vaccination programmes. Description of the intervention The single component live attenuated vaccines of MMR have been licensed in the USA since the 1960s ( Plotkin 1999a ;Plotkin 1999b ;Redd 1999 ). These single vaccines have been shown to be highly effective at reducing the morbidity and mortality ra tes associated with these childhood illnesses. At least ve MMR vaccines are known. 1. T riviraten Berna is a live virus vaccine containing 1000 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious doses) of Edmonston- Zagreb (EZ 19) measles strain, 5000 TCID50 of Rubini strain and 1000 TCID50 of Wistar RA 27/3 rubella strain propagated on human diploid cells. The product contains lactose (14 mg), human albumin (8.8 mg), sodium bicarbonate (0.3 mg), medium 199 (5.7 mg) and distilled water as solvent. 2. M-M-R by Merck is a live virus vaccine. It is a sterile lyophilised preparation of 1000 TCID50 Enders' attenuated Edmonston mumps 20000 TCID50 Jeryl Lynn strain propagated culture; and rubella 1000 TCID50 Wistar RA 27/3 propagated on human diploid lung broblasts. The growt h medium is medium 199 (5.7 mg) used with neomycin as stabiliser. 3. Morupar by Chiron is a live virus vaccine. It contains a sterile lyophilised preparation of 1000 TCID50 of Schwarz measles strain propagated in chick embryo cell culture; 1000 TCID50 Wistar RA 27/3 rubella strain broblasts; and 5000 TCID50 Urabe AM 9 mumps propagated in chick embryo cell culture, with neomycin as stabiliser. 4. Priorix vaccine, Glaxo SmithKline Beecham (GSK), is a lyophilised mixed preparation of the attenuated Schwarz mea sles cell Wistar RA 27/3 rubella strain of viruses. These are separate ly obtained by propagation either in chick embryo tissue cultures (mumps and measles) or MRC5 human diploid cells (rubella). The vaccine also contains residual amounts of neomycin (25 \u00b5g per dose). 5. T rimovax by Pasteur-Merieux Serums and contains live Urabe and Wistar RA 27/3 rubella strain, 1000TCID50. How the intervention might work No national health policy recommends that the MMR vaccine be given as three separate vaccines. Combined live attenuated MM R vaccine was introduced in the USA in the 1970s ( Redd 1999 ; Schwarz 1975 ). MMR is included in the World Health Orga- nization's Expanded Programme on Immunisation and it is used in over 50 European countries, the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand; in total, over 90 countries around the world use the MMR vaccine. Accepted recommendations are that the rst dose should be administered on or after the rst birthday and the second dose of MMR at least 28 days later. In many European countries the second dose is administered at four to 10 years of age. Vaccination with MMR provides signicant improvement in the efciency of paediatric immunisation through the administra tion of three vaccines in a single injection, which is important in red uc- ing costs while increasing immunisation coverage against the t hree diseases ( Makino 1990 ). The incidence of MMR worldwide has been signicantly reduced by MMR vaccination ( WHO 1999 ). Single-component measles vaccine (MV) is actually used in nearly all African WHO member states (44 out of 47 states); in the main cases vaccination schedules prescribe a single-dose administrat ion at nine months of age. In only four African countries (Algeria, Lesotho, Republic of South Africa, Swaziland) a second MV dose is administered at 18 months or at six years of age (Algeria) ( WHO 2011 ). The administration of the rst dose of measles-contain- ing vaccine at nine months of age is recommended in countries with ongoing transmission and with high risk of measles mort al- ity among infants, in order to ensure adequate protection. Th e introduction of a second measles-containing vaccine dose to the immunisation schedule is recommended only when a coverage of at least 80% for the rst dose of measles-containing vaccine has been reached for three consecutive years. It should be administ ered 3 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.at 15 to 18 months of age ( WHO 2009 ). Altogether, besides 44 African WHO member countries, an additional 24 countries have exclusively used MV in their vaccination schedule (among others the Russian Federation). Eleven countries have a single-dose M V administration at nine months of age (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Djibouti, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Nepal , So- malia, Sri Lanka, Timor Leste, Vanuatu and Vietnam). The capability of MMR mass immunisation to eliminate the tar- geted disease has been demonstrated in a number of countries. The USA is the largest country to have ended endemic measles trans - mission ( Strebel 2004 ), with interruption of indigenous transmis- sion in 1993 ( Watson 1998 ). In Finland, a national programme launched in 1982 reached measles elimination in 1996 and in 199 9 the country was documented as free of indigenous mumps and rubella ( Peltola 2000 ). These experiences demonstrate the possi- bility of achieving interruption of transmission in large ge ographic areas and suggest the feasibility of global eradication of me asles. Therefore, it would be ethically unacceptable to conduct placebo- controlled trials to assess vaccine effects. Current research on the effectiveness of MMR vaccines focuses on comparison of vaccine strains and optimising protection by modifying the immunisa tion schedules; these topics are outside the scope of the present rev iew. A retrospective study ( Kreidl 2003 ) reported data about MMR vaccination coverage for local areas in South Tyrol (North-East Italy) and reported cases of measles in the same areas. In all a reas with complete vaccination coverage below 50%, an incidence of at least 333 cases per 100,000 was observed; whereas a very low incidence of the disease was registered in those areas where th e highest immunisation coverage was achieved, despite their hi gher population density. After the introduction of MMR vaccine in England in October 1988, the annual incidence of mumps declined sharply. The an- nual incidence rate fell from 160/100,000 in 1989 to 17/100,00 0 in 1995 ( Gay 1997 ). One retrospective observational study, which seemed to show a n unexpectedly low clinical effectiveness ( Vandermeulen 2004 ) was carried out on 1825 children aged between 15 months and 11 years. It examined the incidence of mumps in seven kindergarte ns and primary schools in Belgium during a mumps outbreak. This was assessed using questionnaires completed by parents and f ol- lowing evaluation of the reported data according to the Center s for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ( CDC 1997 ) case deni- tion. On average, 91.8% of the children had received at least on e dose of MMR vaccine at any time before the outbreak occurred. In this group (N = 1641) mumps was diagnosed in 85 children whereas 20 out of the 139 non-immunised children developed mumps (45 children from both groups were excluded from the analysis because they had a history of mumps prior to the out- break). The components of monovalent vaccine containing MMR viruses, and subsequently combined MMR vaccine, are described below (Makino 1990 ;Plotkin 1999b ). Numerous attenuated measlesvaccines, mostly derived from the Edmonston strain, are curren tly produced worldwide. Four vaccines containing non-Edmonston derived strains are also in use, including Leningrad-16, Shan ghai- 191, CAM-70 and TD97. In most cases the virus is cultured in chick embryo cells. However, a few vaccines are attenuated in human diploid cells. The majority of vaccines contain small dose s of antibiotics (for example 25 \u00b5g of neomycin per dose) but some do not. Sorbitol and gelatin are used as stabilisers ( Schwarz 1975 ). More used throughout the world ( Redd 1999 ). Most vaccines also contain neomycin (25 \u00b5g of per dose). The Jeryl Lynn strain is widely used. Several manufacturers in Japan an d Europe produce a live mumps vaccine containing the Urabe Am9 virus strain. Concerns about vaccine-associated meningitis hav e prompted some countries to stop using MMR with the mumps Urabe strain. Often the viruses are cultured in chick embryo - broblasts (as with the Jeryl Lynn and Urabe strain-containing v ac- cines) but quail and human embryo broblasts are also used for some vaccines. Most rubella vaccines used throughout the world contain the RA 27/3 virus strain ( Plotkin 1965 ). The only exceptions are vac- cines produced in Japan which use different virus strains: Mats uba, DCRB 19, Takahashi and TO- 336 are all produced using rabbit kidney cells; and Matsuura is produced using quail embryo bro b- lasts. The RA 27/3 strain is used most often because of consis- tent immunogenicity, induction of resistance to re-infection an d its low rate of side effects ( Plotkin 1973 ). The live virus produces viraemia and pharyngeal excretion, but both are of and are non-communicable ( Plotkin 1999a ). Why it is important to do this review Despite its worldwide use, no systematic reviews studying t he ef- fectiveness and safety of MMR vaccines are available. O B J E C T I V E S 1.

We also searched the following sources for unpublished, prosp ec- tively registered trials: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ and http:/ /www.controlled-trials.com/ . In addition, we contacted vaccine manufacturers, companies that market vaccines, the leading or corresponding authors of studies evaluated and researchers o r ex- perts in the eld, where appropriate, to identify any unpubl ished studies. We imposed no language restrictions. For safety trials, we assessed bibliographies of all releva nt articles and any published reviews for additional studies. We impose d no language restrictions. Data collection and analysis See Appendix 1 for study design denitions (based on: Farrington 2004 ;Jefferson 1999 ;Last 2001 ). Selection of studies T wo review authors (MGD, CDP) independently applied the in- clusion criteria to all identied and retrieved articles. A thi rd re- view author (VD) arbitrated in case of disagreements about el igi- bility of a study. Data extraction and management Three review authors (AR, MGD, CDP) independently per- formed data extraction using a data extraction form (Appendix 4 ). One review author (VD) checked data extractions and arbitrated in case of disagreements.Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Three review authors (AR, MGD, CDP) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. We assess ed the quality of RCTs and quasi-RCTs using the criteria adapted from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011 ). We assessed the quality of non-RCTs in relation to the presence of potential confounders which could make inter- pretation of the results difcult. However, because there was insuf- cient empirical evidence to demonstrate the validity of the no n- randomised quality assessment screens, these studies were u sed for the purposes of qualitative analysis only. We evaluated the quality of case-control (prospective and retro- spective) and cohort studies using the appropriate Newcastle-O t- tawa Scales (NOS) ( Wells 2000 ). We applied quality control as- sessment grids, based on those developed by The University o f York, NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination ( Khan 2001 ), to historical controlled trials (HCTs), interrupted time-serie s and case cross-over studies and ecological studies (see Appendix 4). We used a classication and methodological quality checklist (unpub - lished) for case-only design studies, especially developed by CP Farrington and TO Jefferson and adapted from a paper by CP Farrington ( Farrington 2004 ). Measures of treatment effect This is a descriptive review. Unit of analysis issues This is a descriptive review. Dealing with missing data We did not use any strategies to impute missing outcome data. Assessment of heterogeneity We rstly assessed included studies for clinical homogeneity. As we found diversity of exposure, outcomes and length of follow - up, we decided against pooling data and carried out a descriptiv e review. Assessment of reporting biases Not performed. Data synthesis We classied and discussed included studies according to the type of outcomes for which they provided evidence, i.e. effectivenes s, 6 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration.

R E S U L T S Description of studies See:Characteristics of included studies ;Characteristics of excluded studies ;Characteristics of studies awaiting classication . Results of the search We updated the searches in May 2011 and identied 3371 articles for screening. We identied and retrieved 96 papers after rev iewing the titles and abstracts. Out of these, we included 33 in the upd ate. Our original searches identied 4889 articles for screening, a large number of studies because of the deliberately broad search des ign. After screening, we retrieved 139 studies possibly fulllin g our inclusion criteria; 108 studies did not meet all inclusion crite ria and were excluded, while 31 were included in this review. In thi s 2011 update, we included a total of 64 studies. Included studies We included the following studies. Five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) ( Bloom 1975 ; Edees 1991 ;Lerman 1981 ;Peltola 1975 1989 ; Fombonne 2001 2000 Fombonne 2006 ;Freeman 1993 ;Honda 2005 ). One case cross-over trial ( Park 2004 ). T wo ecological studies ( Jonville-Bera 1996 ;Seagroatt 2005 ). Six self controlled case series ( France 2008 ;Miller 2005 ; Miller 2007 ;Stowe 2009 ;Taylor 1999 ;Ward 2007 ). One study ( Freeman 1993 ) had a mixed RCT and time-series design and we classied it as the latter because adverse event d ata comparison was carried out on outcomes in children before and after vaccination. We classied studies reported as 'eld tria ls' or 'controlled trials' as cohort studies when randomisation was not mentioned. T welve studies included effectiveness data against measles o r mumps diseases: seven cohorts ( 1975 ;Edees 1975 ); one CCT ( Ceyhan 2001 ); 10 cohort studies ( Beck ;Benjamin 1992 ;Dunlop 1989 ;Makino 1990 ;Weibel ) and one time-series study ( Freeman 1993 ). Important safety harms had been investigated in 35 studies: nine cohort studies ( Ahlgren 2004 2005 Mrozek-Budzyn ;Ray ;Smeeth ); time-series da Cunha 2002 ;Dourado 2000 ;Fombonne 2006 ;Honda 2005 ); one case cross-over trial ( Park 2004 ); two ecological stud- ies (Jonville-Bera 1996 ;Seagroatt 2005 ) and seven self controlled case series ( France 2008 ;Makela 2002 ;Miller 2005 ;Miller 2007 ; Stowe 2009 ;Taylor 1999 ;Ward 2007 ). Excluded studies Out of the 96 papers identied and retrieved for this update, we excluded 50 because they were not comparative, considered vaccines other than MMR, or did not present original data. (See Characteristics of excluded studies table for detailed information regarding reasons for exclusion). We classied a further 13 stu dies as pending, as some important details were not available in t he papers (see Characteristics of studies awaiting classication table). Risk of bias in included studies 7 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Studies evaluating vaccine effectiveness Out of the 12 cohorts and case-control studies assessing effectiv e- ness of MMR vaccines in preventing measles or mumps, only three had a moderate bias risk. The remaining nine were characterise d by poor methodological quality due to poor reporting or miss- ing information about comparability between exposed or non-e x- posed groups; the composition of MMR vaccine is sometimes not reported ( Table 1 Table 2 andTable 3 ). Studies evaluating short-term side effects Seventeen trials reported on short-term side effects: ve RCT s; one CCT; 10 cohort studies and one time-series study ( Table 4 ). We assessed the risk of bias in the RCTs and CCT to be of low risk of bias in two trials ( Lerman 1981 ;Peltola 1986 ); moderate/ unknown risk of bias in two trials ( Ceyhan 2001 ;Edees 1991 ); and high risk of bias in two trials ( Bloom 1975 ;Schwarz 1975 ). Allocation Out of the ve RCTs and one CCT assessing short-term side ef- fects, only two studies ( Lerman 1981 ;Peltola 1986 ) had adequate concealment. Blinding Out of the ve RCTs and one CCT assessing short-term side ef- fects, three were two ( Bloom 1975 ;Ceyhan 2001 ) were not blinded. Incomplete outcome data In the Ceyhan 2001 andLerman 1981 trials, the selection of paediatric practices involved in the recruitment of children wa s not explained and the number and assessment of non-responder s were not reported. Similarly in the Edees 1991 trial there are few details on the refusal and response rate during the recruitme nt phase and a lack of demographic information from the two UK areas where the trial was conducted. We considered the Ceyhan 2001 andEdees 1991 trials to have a moderate risk of detection bias affecting the outcomes. Selective reporting In the two trials we assessed as being at high risk of reportin g bias (Bloom 1975 ;Schwarz 1975 ), we reported adverse effects for only 60% and 39% of participants, respectively. Other potential sources of bias Not known.Cohort studies Low risk of bias: no studies. Moderate/unknown risk of bias: two studies ( Benjamin 1992 ;Robertson 1988 ). High risk of bias: eight studies ( Beck 1989 ;Dunlop 1989 ; Makino ;Miller 2010 ;Stokes 1971 ;Swartz 1974 ;Weibel 1980 ). There was a lack of adequate description of exposure (vaccine content and schedules) in all cohort studies. Another recurring problem was the failure of any study to provide descriptions o f all outcomes monitored. A lack of clarity in reporting and systemat ic bias made comparability across studies and quantitative synt hesis of data impossible. Time-series studies The only time-series study ( Freeman 1993 ) was evaluated to be affected by a high degree of risk of bias. The number of complete d weekly diaries varied over the eight-week study period, with no indication of whether the losses occurred pre or postvaccination . In addition, there was an overall attrition rate of 33%. Studies evaluating safety harms The association between MMR and serious harms was investigat ed in 35 studies (nine cohorts, 12 case-control studies, four time- series studies, one case-cross over, two ecological studies, sev en self controlled case series). Results of risk of bias assessment in t he following is split by study design. Cohort studies Low risk of bias: two studies ( Hviid 2004 ;Vestergaard 2008 ;Madsen 2001 the number and possible impact of bias was so high that interpretation of the results was difcult. The co hort study of Uchiyama 2007 was potentially affected by a different type of bias, considering that the participants were from a pri vate clinic and that denitions of applied Autistic Spectrum Disor - ders (ASD) diagnosis and of methods used for ASD regression as - certainment were not clearly reported. Estimates from McKeever 2004 (although signicant) are strongly affected by ascertainment bias, as children who are not taken to the doctor are less likely to be vaccinated and also have fewer opportunities to have diagno ses of allergic diseases recorded. 8 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Case-control studies Low risk of bias: two studies ( Black 1997 ;Davis 2001 ). Moderate/unknown risk of bias: eight studies ( 2003 ; Bremner 2005 ;Bremner 2007 ;DeStefano 2004 2005 ; Mrozek-Budzyn ;Ray 2006 ;Smeeth 2009b ;Bertuola 2010 ). InBlack 1997 there was a moderate likelihood of selection bias because of missing cases and their records (up to 27%) but the study and its methods were well reported. Lack of clarity over the vaccine exposure status of the controls made the results of t he Black 2003 study difcult to interpret. In Bertuola 2010 , cases and controls were apparently not matched. Ascertainment of exposu re was performed only with questionnaires to parents. Investi gators were probably not blinded to the case or control status of the pa r- ticipants. In Ma 2005 , refusal to participate in the study or inabil- ity to locate the participants and controls could have introduced a moderate risk of selection bias. Exclusion of participants wit hout completed questionnaires and of those who did not attend the sixth grade at school within the study area could have introduce d a relevant selection bias in the Ahlgren 2009b case-control study. Time-series studies Low risk of bias: no studies. Moderate/unknown risk of bias: three studies ( da Cunha 2002 ;Dourado 2000 ;Honda ). of bias: one study ( Fombonne 2006 ). Limited error could have been introduced by using population d ata from a prior census (as estimation of the denominator) in Dourado 2000 , so as by using the number of doses administered (as opposed to supplied) in the mass vaccination programme. Assessment of Pervasive Development Disorders (PDD) cases in Fombonne 2006 was made on the basis of administrative codes only: diagnosis could have been imprecise and did not allow us to consider PDD subtypes or regression. Case cross-over studies Low risk of bias: no studies. Moderate/unknown risk of bias in one study ( Park 2004 ). High risk of bias: no studies. InPark 2004 there was a moderate likelihood of selection bias due to missing cases and their records (up to 27%). Ecological studies Low risk of bias: no studies. Moderate/unknown risk of bias: one study ( Jonville-Bera 1996 ). High risk of bias: one study ( Seagroatt 2005 ).Self controlled case series studies Low risk of bias: two studies ( France 2008 ;Ward 2007 ). Moderate/unknown risk of bias: four studies ( 2002 ; Miller 2005 ;Miller 2007 ;Taylor 1999 ). High risk of bias: one study ( Stowe 2009 ). The study by Makela 2002 was weakened by the loss of 14% of the original birth cohorts and the effects of the rather long - term follow-up. What the impact of either of these factors was in terms of confounders is open to debate. It should be taken into account that autism does not often involve hospitalisation an d data about outpatients visits were not available. The long f ollow- up for autism could be due to the lack of a properly constructed causal hypothesis. Again, the study of Taylor 1999 demonstrates the difculties of drawing inferences in the absence of a non- exposed population or a clearly dened causal hypothesis. The exclusive use of discharge diagnoses for identication of cases in Miller 2007 could have introduced a noteworthy selection bias. Effects of interventions Studies reporting effectiveness ndings Eight cohorts and ve case-control studies investigated effecti ve- ness outcomes. Measles Evidence from cohort studies Effectiveness against measles was investigated in three coho rt stud- ies (Marin 2006 ;Marolla 1998 ;Ong 2007 ). One cohort study ( Marolla 1998 ) evaluated the effectiveness of MMR vaccination in preventing clinical cases of measles in chil- dren aged 18 to 90 months from several local health agencies in Rome, Italy (n = 2745). Vaccination was performed with three dif- ferent commercial MMR vaccines, two containing both Schwarz strain (Pluserix and Morupar) and one other prepared with Ed- monston-Zagreb strain (T riviraten). Vaccines effectiveness wa s calculated by using the following formula [1-(measles incidence among vaccinated/measles incidence among unvaccinated) x 100]. Effectiveness (one dose) was estimated to be 97% (95% condence interval (CI) 88 to 99) in the Morupar study arm, whereas no measles cases were found among Pluserix recipients. Effective ness was comparably high (95%; 95% CI 90 to 98) when T riviraten was administered. One other cohort study ( Ong 2007 ) investigated the effective- ness of MMR immunisation (composition not reported by au- thors) in children aged between eight and 14 years in prevent- ing measles cases with laboratory conrmation. T wo laborator y- 9 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.conrmed measles cases occurred among the 171 vaccinated chil- dren (one dose), whereas seven were observed in the unvaccinated group (n = 13). Vaccine effectiveness (VE = 97%) was calculated inOrenstein 1985 , [(attack rate among unvaccinated-attack rate among vaccinated/attack rate among unvaccinated) x 100]. Effectiveness of MMR vaccination in preventing secondary measles cases was assessed in the Marin 2006 study. Vaccination with one or two doses of MMR vaccine (composition unknown) was highly effective in preventing secondary cases among contact s. Estimate VE ( Orenstein 1985 ) was 92% (95% CI 67 to 98) after one dose and 95% (95% CI 82 to 98) after two doses. Mumps Effectiveness of the MMR vaccine against clinical mumps disease was assessed in ve cohort and ve case-control studies. Evidence from cohort studies In three cohort studies ( Marolla 1998 ;Ong 2005 ;Schlegel 1999 ) occurrence of clinical mumps cases during outbreaks was retro- spectively evaluated by comparing the incidence of disease amon g children who had been immunised with MMR vaccines contain- ing different mumps strains (Jeryl Lynn, Urabe, Rubini) wit h that observed among non-immunised children. InOng 2005 , carried out in childcare centres and primary schools in Singapore (n = 5072, aged ve to 12) and Schlegel 1999 , per- formed on children (n = 163, aged ve to 13 years) from a small rural village in Switzerland, preventive effectiveness for Jeryl Lynn, Urabe or Rubini strains was compared with no immunisation. Preventive effectiveness estimates ( Orenstein 1985 ) for at least one dose of the Jeryl Lynn strain-containing MMR vaccine were similar in both studies, with statistically relevant signi cance: VE 80.7%; 95% CI (95% CI ( Schlegel 1999 ). Effectiveness of MMR Urabe vaccine (at least one dose) has been estimated to be highly effective (VE 87%; 95% CI 76 to 94) in Schlegel 1999 , whereas the estimate from the Ong 2005 study did not reach statistical relevance (VE 54%; 95% CI -16.2 to 81.7). The Rubini strain-containing MMR vaccine was highly ineffective in preventing clinical mumps cases in the Ong 2005 study (VE - 55.3%; 95% CI -121.8 to -8.8); the estimate from the Schlegel 1999 study was not statistically relevant (VE -4%; 95% CI 218 to 15). InMarolla 1998 effectiveness against mumps was similar for both Urabe-containing MMR vaccines (VE 75%; 95% CI 65 to 83 for Pluserix and VE 73%; 95% CI 59 to 82 for Morupar). The Rubini strain was much less effective (VE 23%; 95% CI 6 to 37). The cohort of Lopez Hernandez 2000 estimated MMR vacci- nation effectiveness in preventing clinical mumps on male chil- dren aged between three and 15 years, attending a scholastic i nsti- tute in Granada, Spain during an outbreak. Occurrence of clinicalmumps cases was compared between children who received at least one dose of MMR vaccine (investigators were not able to deter- mine the vaccine composition) and those who did not receive the MMR vaccine. The effectiveness estimate was 49% (P = 0.047) (Orenstein 1985 ). One other ( investigated the occur- rence of clinical mumps in MMR vaccinated and non-vaccinated household contacts aged up to 16 years (secondary cases) of pri- mary mumps cases (with clinical or laboratory conrmation). Urabe-containing MMR vaccine showed a protective effect against secondary case onset in comparison with no vaccination: vaccine effectiveness as ([1-(attack rate in vaccinated/attack rate in not vaccinated)] x 100) was 73.1%; 95% CI 41.8 to 87.6. Protection afforded by both Jeryl Lynn and Rubini-containing MMR vac- cines was instead not statistically relevant (VE 61.6%; 95% CI - 0.9 to 85.4 and VE 6.3%; 95% CI -45.9 to 39.8, respectively). Evidence from case-control studies Five case-control studies assessed the effectiveness of MMR against Harling 2005 ) assessed effectiveness of immunisation with one or two doses of Jeryl Lynn-containing MMR vaccine in the prevention of clinical and laboratory-con- rmed mumps cases. Cases (n = 156) and controls (n = 175) were children and adolescents (aged one to 18 years) living in a relig ious community in North-East London, where a mumps outbreak was observed (June 1998 to May 1999). Effectiveness estimates (ex- pressed as VE = [(1-Odds Ratio) x 100] for one or two doses were similar against clinical (VE 69%; 95% CI 41 to 84) and labora- tory-conrmed mumps (VE 65%; 95% CI 25 to 84). T wo doses were more effective (VE 88%; 95% CI 62 to 96) than one (VE 64%; 95% CI 40 to 78) against clinical mumps. The following three case-control studies used surveillance sys tems with the aim of identifying mumps cases in the study populatio n. Goncalves 1998 assessed the effectiveness of at least one dose of MMR vaccines prepared with either the Urabe or Rubini strain in prevention of clinical mumps cases during an epidemic on a pop- ulation of children and adolescents (189 cases and 378 controls, aged 15 months to 16 years). Signicant protection was conferred by the Urabe strain-containing MMR vaccine [1-Odds Ra- tio (OR)] x 100 = 70%; 95% CI 25 to 88), and not by the Rubini strain-containing MMR (VE 1%; 95% CI -108 to 53). InGiovanetti 2002 eld effectiveness of MMR vaccination (at least one dose, unknown composition) in preventing clinical mumps on a population of children and adolescents (139 cases and controls) was 53.7% (95% CI 20.3 to 73.0 ; InCastilla 2009a , epidemiological conrmation ( Table 3 ), occurring during an outbreak in the Navarre region (Northern Spain) be- tween August 2006 and June 2008 in children and adolescents 10 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.(241 cases and 1205 matched controls). Vaccine effectiveness of MMR vaccine prepared with Jeryl Lynn mumps strain (VE = [1- OR] x 100), calculated by means of conditional logistic regressi on analysis, was 72% (95% CI 39% to 87%, = 66% (95% CI 25% to 85%, P = 0.0075) dose and 83% (95% CI 54% to 94%, P = 0.0005) for two doses. The au- thors hypothesised a higher risk of having mumps when the rs t MMR dose is administered after the 36th month of age (OR 3.11; 95% CI 1.15 to 8.43, P = 0.0254) or when the two MMR doses are administered more than 36 months apart (OR 10.19; 95% CI 1.47 to 70.73, P = 0.0189). Mackenzie 2006 attempted to estimate effectiveness of MMR vac- cination against virological-conrmed mumps on pupils (aged 13 to 17 years) attending a boarding school in Scotland (20 cases and 40 matched controls). The numerical size of the study was not large enough to reach statistical relevance (OR for any MMR dose = 0.66; 95% CI 0.22 to 2.00). Rubella We found no studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR vaccine against clinical rubella. Short-term side effects CCTs and MMR (Ceyhan and rubella vaccines ( Lerman 1981 (Bloom 1975 ;Lerman 1981 ;Peltola 1986 ;Schwarz 1975 ). One trial ( Peltola 1986 ) carried out in twins, reported a possible pro- tective effect of the MMR vaccine with a lower incidence of respi- ratory symptoms, nausea and vomiting, and no difference in th e incidence of other unintended side effects compared with placebo , with the exception of irritability. Another trial concluded th at there was no increased clinical reactivity with a MMR vaccine contain- ing two strains of rubella ( Lerman 1981 ). The trial by Edees concluded that there was no signicant differ - ence between the numbers of children developing symptoms afte r MMR or measles vaccination ( Edees 1991 ). The trials by Bloom and Schwarz concluded that the incidence of raised temperature, rash, lymphadenopathy, coryza, rhinitis, cough, local reactio ns or limb and joint symptoms were not signicantly different from placebo ( Bloom 1975 ;Schwarz 1975 ). All RCTs and CCTs reported a wide range of outcomes and used different terms, often with no denition. For example, body temperature higher than 38 \u00b0C was measured or reported in 16 ways. When reported, different temperature increments, recor d- ing methods, observation periods and incidence made compar- isons between trials and pooling of data impossible ( Table 5 ).Cohort studies Occurrence of short-term side effects was assessed in 10 cohort studies altogether. They compared the MMR vaccine with sin- gle measles vaccine ( Dunlop ), placebo ( Beck 1989 ) or no intervention (Benjamin 1992 ;Sharma 2010 ;Stokes 1971 ). The study by Benjamin found that the MMR vaccine was associ- ated with an increased risk of episodes of joint and limb sympt oms in girls less than ve years of age ( Benjamin 1992 ). There was no difference in the incidence of common outcomes such as fever, rash, cough, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, mya l- gia and anorexia between the rubella ). T wo studies (Miller 1989 ;Robertson 1988 ) found that symptoms were sim- ilar following MMR and measles vaccination except for a higher incidence of parotitis following MMR vaccination ( Miller 1989 ). Makino reported a higher incidence of diarrhoea in the MMR vaccines arm compared to the single measles or rubella vaccines arms ( Makino 1990 ). The studies by Beck and Stokes reported no difference in the incidence of rash and lymphadenopathy be- tween MMR vaccination and placebo ( Beck 1989 ) or do nothing (Stokes 1971 ). However, Stokes 1971 reported an increase in the incidence of fever in the period Day 5 to Day 12 postvaccination butBeck 1989 reported no difference. Considering the cohort of Sharma 2010 only within the subgroup of younger children (16 to 24 months of age), fever during the 42 days postvaccination had been reported more frequently among individuals immunised with MMR than among unvaccinated in- dividuals. This trend appeared to be different when the olde r popu- lation was considered; fever had been reported with slightly higher frequency among unvaccinated children. Time-series In the Freeman 1993 study, conducted by 22 family physicians, occurrence of common symptoms following MMR immunisation (type not described) was assessed by means of weekly diaries in par- ticipants immunised at 13 and 15 months of age, comparing their incidence during the four weeks before with that observed four weeks after immunisation. The incidence of rash, lymphadenop a- thy and nasal discharge was found to be higher after exposure t o MMR immunisation. Severe harms Possible association of MMR immunisation with severe harms h as been tested in several observational studies. 11 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Neurological diseases 1. Encephalitis - encephalopathy Association between MMR immunisation and occurrence of en- cephalopathies was investigated in three studies: one case-con - trol study ( Ray 2006 ) and two self controlled case series studies (Makela 2002 ;Ward 2007 ). The case-control study of Ray 2006 tested if hospitalisations due to encephalopathy, Reyes syndrome or encephalitis ( Table 6 ) oc- curring in children aged zero to six years could be linked to MMR vaccine administration. Different time intervals between MM R exposure and date of hospitalisation have been considered: s even to 14 days, zero to 14 days, zero to 30 days, zero to 60 days and zero to 90 days. Four hundred and fty-two cases together with their 1280 matched controls were included in the analysis. In no ne of the considered time intervals was exposure to the MMR vaccine statistically different among the cases and controls. Makela 2002 was based on a surveillance study by the National Public Health Institute that began after the introduction of MMR vaccination in Finland for children aged 14 to 18 months and six years (1982). Participants aged one to seven years (n = 535,544) who received the MMR II vaccine between November 1982 and June 1986 were considered in the study (this population corre- sponds to 86% of all children scheduled for MMR vaccination in Finland). Risk association was evaluated by comparing the numb er of hospitalisations for encephalitis or encephalopathy (see Table 6for outcome denition) within three months after vaccination with those occurring during the subsequent seven three-month intervals. Out of the 199 hospitalisations for encephalitis or en- cephalopathy, nine occurred within three months after MMR vac- cination, 110 occurred more than three months after vaccination (88 in an interval between three and 24 months), whereas 80 oc- curred before the vaccine was administered. T rial authors stat ed that no hospitalisation excess for encephalitis or encephalop athy was observed during the three months post-immunisation (P = 0.28). InWard 2007 , in order to evaluate the association between en- cephalitis (see Table 6 for case denitions) and MMR vaccination, cases (n = 107) diagnosed at the age of 12 to 35 months were considered (children aged 12 to 15 months were scheduled for MMR vaccination in Britain and Ireland). The risk period for en- cephalitis was considered to be the time between 15 and 35 days following MMR immunisation. The incidence of disease within the risk period was compared with that outside it (the control pe - riod). The incidence of encephalitis in the risk period (15 to 35 days) was not statistically different from that of the control period (relative incidence = 1.34 ; 95% CI 0.52 to 3.47). This estimate does not change in the presence or absence of primary HHV-6 or HHV-7 infections.2. Aseptic meningitis The association of the MMR vaccine with aseptic meningitis was evaluated in the following studies. Case-control studies InBlack 1997 , MMR vaccination within dened intervals before the index date (zero to 14 days, zero to 30 days, eight to 14 days ) was assessed in cases and controls to assess its association wit h aseptic meningitis (see Table 7 for outcome denitions). Exposure to the MMR vaccine was not statistically different between cases and controls in any of the considered time intervals. Cross-over studies InPark 2004 the risk association of MMR vaccination with aseptic meningitis (see Table 7 for outcome denitions) has been evaluated by means of a cross-over design. Thirty-nine participants aged 1 3 to 29 months of both sexes were included. Risk estimation was calculated considering whether MMR vaccine exposure occurred during a time window of 42 days before disease onset or before (from 43 to 365 days before): 11 out of the 39 participants receive d MMR vaccination during the risk period and 28 outside of it. Mantel-Haenszel OR estimate indicates a positive association (3.0; 95% CI 1.5 to 6.1). Self-controlled case-series study In the study of Makela 2002 , risk association of (Enders-Edmonston, Jeryl Lynn ,Wistar RA 27/3) was assessed as for encephalitis, by comparing the number of ho spi- talisations within three months after vaccination with those occur- ring during the subsequent seven three-month intervals. T en hos- pitalisations for aseptic meningitis occurred within three m onths after MMR immunisation, whereas there were 110 thereafter (5 4 between three and 24 months) and 41 were vaccinated after hos- pitalisation. No signicant increase in aseptic meningitis w as ob- served during the three months following immunisation (P = 0.57). Time-series studies Dourado 2000 compared the incidence of aseptic meningitis hos- pitalisation (see Table 7 for denitions) before and after a mass im- munisation campaign (Pluserix) carried out in Salvador city (Sta te of Bahia, NE Brazil, population about 2.2 million in 1996) an d having as target population children aged one to 11 years (452, 334 based on the 1996 census). The incidence of aseptic meningitis hospitalisation was signicantly higher during the third (18 cases 12 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.risk ratio (RR) 14.28; 95% CI 7.93 to 25.71), fourth (15 cases RR 11.90; 95% CI 6.38 to 22.19), fth (nine cases, RR 7.14; 95% CI 3.38 to 15.08) and sixth (four cases, RR 3.17; 95% CI 1.12 to 9.02) weeks following the start of the immunisation campai gn when compared with that observed during the 23 pre-immunisa- tion weeks (reference period). Risk association was moreover es - timated by case series method, including in analysis only the 3 7 aseptic meningitis cases with known vaccination status and dat e occurring during the epidemiological weeks 36 to 39 (about 15 to 35 days after immunisation). Authors attributed 32 of the 3 7 cases to be due to Urabe-containing MMR vaccine Pluserix (one in about 14,000 doses). The study of da Cunha 2002 had an analogous design and was car- ried out in two other Brazilian states, Mato Grosso (MT) and Ma to Grosso do Sul (MS). As before, the target population were childr en aged one to 11 years (estimated 580,587 in MS and 473,718 in MT). The incidence of aseptic meningitis in MS became signi- cantly higher than in the pre-immunisation time from two weeks after the start of the campaign (four cases, RR 5.6; 95% CI 1.3 to 14.1), which peaked at three weeks (16 cases, RR 22.5; 95% CI 11.8 to 42.9) and four weeks after the start of the campaign (15 cases, RR 21.1; 95% CI 11.0 to 40.7) and returned to the average after week 39. A similar trend was observed in MT , whe re the incidence of cases became signicantly higher during the thir d week (40) after the start of the campaign (ve cases, RR 2.6; 95% CI 1.1 to 6.5) which peaked in week 42 (30 cases, RR 15.6; 95% CI 10.3 to 24.2) and week 43 (23 cases, RR 12.0; 95% CI 7.6 to 19.4) and returned to the average from week 46 onwards. 3. Febrile seizure Person-time cohort studies The study of Vestergaard 2004 is a person-time cohort assessing the risk of febrile seizure ( Table 8 ) after the introduction of routine MMR vaccination in Denmark in 1987. The study population consisted of the birth cohorts 1991 to 1998 (n = 537,171). Glob- ally, the risk of febrile seizure was signicantly higher amo ng the vaccinated (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15). When different time frames after vaccination are considered, the RR was at the highe st point within two weeks after immunisation (RR 2.75; 95% CI 2.55 to 2.97), did not differ signicantly in weeks three to six and became slightly less than one in weeks seven, eight, nine to 26 and 27 to 52. The RR was not different to the unvaccinated after week 53. For evaluation of long-term prognosis, the number of recurrent episodes of febrile seizure and the cases of epileps y ob- served in children who received MMR vaccination within 14 days before their rst febrile seizure episode and in those who we re vac- cinated more than 14 days before their rst febrile seizure ep isode, were compared with those who were not vaccinated at the time of their rst febrile seizure episode. A signicant risk asso ciationwas found only for recurrent febrile seizure episodes in child ren who were immunised with MMR within 14 days before the rst episode (RR 1.19; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.41, adjusted for age, calenda r period, age at rst febrile seizure and current vaccination sta tus). Self controlled case series study InWard 2007 (already described in the section 'Encephalitis - en- cephalopathy'), the risk of severe illness with fever and convu lsion following MMR immunisation was also investigated. The consi d- ered risk period was the time between six and 11 days followin g immunisation. As before, disease incidence within the risk pe riod was compared with that outside it (the control period). Episodes of severe illness with fever and convulsion were more frequent w ithin six to 11 days after MMR immunisation (relative incidence (RI) 5.68; 95% CI 2.31 to 13.97). InMiller 2007 children aged 12 to 23 months (n = 894) with a discharge diagnosis of febrile convulsion ( Table 8 ) and who re- ceived one MMR vaccine dose were included in the analysis. The incidence of disease during two \"at risk\" periods (between six t o 11 and 15 to 35 days after immunisation) was compared with that determined for the background period. During the time betwee n six and 11 days following MMR vaccination (of all types) a sig- nicantly higher relative incidence (RI) of febrile convulsion h ad been observed (RI 4.09; 95% CI 3.1 to 5.33). On the contrary, RI of febrile convulsions did not differ signicantly from the ba ck- ground period during the 15 to 35 days following MMR immu- nisation (RI 1.13; 95% analysed Table 9 ). Considering all MMR vaccine types, the risk incidence remains higher in the six to 11 days following vaccina- tion (RI 4.27; 95% CI 3.17 to 5.76), whereas the time between 15 to 35 days following vaccination it remains of borderline si g- nicance (RI 1.33; studies InBlack 2003 cases (n = 23) and matched controls (n = 116) were selected within data contained in the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Relative risk of developing idiopathic thro m- bocytopaenic purpura (ITP) (see Table 10 ) within six weeks af- ter MMR immunisation was estimated to be 6.3 (95% CI 1.3 to 30.1) with an estimate attributable risk of 1 case/25,000 dos es. Risk would be not statistically different from reference grou ps for the time between 7 and 26 weeks after vaccination. Also Bertuola 2010 tested the association between acute immune thrombocytopaenia (AIT) and MMR vaccination by means of a case-control design in children and adolescents (aged one month 13 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.to 18 years). The risk estimate was calculated considering the ex - posure to the MMR vaccine (strain composition not reported) during the six weeks preceding hospitalisation in cases and con - trols (see denitions Table 10 ). Fourteen out of the 387 cases and 27 out of the 1924 controls received the MMR vaccine within six weeks before hospitalisation (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7, adjus ted for age and use of drugs by multiple logistic regression). Self controlled case series and risk interval studies The study by France 2008 is based on data contained in the Vac- cines Safety Datalink project for the years 1991 to 2000, coveri ng eight managed care organisations (MCO) across the USA. By con- sulting the database, 63 cases aged 12 to 23 months who met the denition ( Table 10 ) could be identied. The 42 days following immunisation was considered as the exposed period, whereas t he time before and after this was considered the not exposed peri od, with the exclusion of a six-week time interval before vaccinatio n. T wenty cases had been classied as exposed and 43 as not exposed . The incidence rate ratio (IRR) between the exposed and unexpose d time was calculated by using two different analytical methods: the self controlled case series (SCCS) and the \"risk interval\" (i .e. person-time cohort) method. By the SCCS method, conditional Poisson regression was used to calculate the IRR, controlled by age and excluding xed covariate from the model (gender, MCO, MMR dose number). By the \"risk interval\" method, the Poisson regression model controlled for age, MMR dose number, MCO site and gender was used to calculate IRR. Estimates were respe c- tively 5.38 (95% CI 10.62) and 3.94 (95% CI 2.01 to 7.69). Considering the analysis included only children aged 12 to 15 months (the age at which about 80% of MMR vaccinations were administered), the IRR estimates were 7.06 (95% CI 1.95 to 25.88) and to 25.03) for SCCS and \"risk time\", respectively. The attributable risk was estimated to be about 1 ITP case per 40,000 administered MMR doses. Ecological studies The evidence of association between MMR, or any of its compo- nent vaccines, and the onset of thrombocytopenic purpura (TP) was also assessed in one ecological study ( Jonville-Bera 1996 ). The study concluded that the evidence favoured an association but in all cases TP appeared to be a benign, self limiting condition no t distinguishable from its idiopathic counterpart or from TP o ccur- ring after natural infection with measles, mumps or rubella. The study discussed the weakness of relying on the passive report ing system for the identication of cases and acknowledged a possib le under-reporting of cases of TP . AutismCohort studies Three retrospective cohort studies investigated the risk of a utism and pervasive development disorders (PDD) 9 ). The study by Madsen 2002 was conducted in Denmark and in- cluded all Danish children born between January 1991 and De- cember 1998. The authors linked vaccination data reported in th e National Board of Health with a diagnosis of autism ( Table 9 ) from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register. After adjustm ent for confounders, the RR for autism is 0.92 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.24) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.07) for other autistic spectrum disorder s. No association between age at vaccination, time since vaccination or date of vaccination and development of autism was found. The retrospective cohort study by Fombonne 2001 tested several causal hypotheses and mechanisms of association between expo- sure to MMR vaccination and pervasive development disorders (PDDs, Table 9 ). The population was made up of three cohorts of participants; one was of older children acting as the control (pre-MMR vaccination introduction). The authors concluded that there was no evidence that PDDs had become more frequent, the mean age at parental concern had not moved closer to the date of exposure to MMR vaccination, there was no evidence that regres- sion with autism had become more common, parents of autistic children with regression did not become concerned about their child in a different time frame from that of children without re - gression and children with regressive autism did not have dif ferent proles or severity to those in the control group. Nor was ther e evidence that regressive autism was associated with inflammat ory bowel disorders. The retrospective cohort study by Uchiyama 2007 assessed the association between exposure to MMR vaccination and regressio n in autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). Participants were childre n with an ASD diagnosis ( Table 9 ) from a private paediatric psychi- atric clinic located in Yokohama city, Japan (Yokohama Psycho- Developmental Clinic, YPCD), that has become recognised as a centre for ASD. For study purposes, cases of ASD in patients bor n between 1976 and 1999 were considered (n = 904). They were classied according to the chance of having received the MMR vaccine as follows. 1. Pre-MMR vaccine generation: born between January 1976 and December 1984, n = 113. 2. MMR vaccine generation: born between January 1985 and December 1991, n = 292. 3. Post-MMR vaccine generation with an age of one to three years old after 1993 when the MMR vaccination programme was terminated, n = 499. For 325 out of the 904 identied ASD cases, a regression in ASD could be assessed. Data were analysed in different ways. Within the MMR vaccine generation group, OR estimates were calculated considering the cases of deterioration observed in ch il- dren who received the MMR vaccine from the MCH handbook 14 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.(15/54) and the number of regression observed among participa nts who did not receive the MMR vaccine (45/132), after exclusion of those with unknown vaccination status (89). Authors reported an OR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.52, P = 0.49) in patients who received the MMR vaccine versus no MMR vaccination in the MMR period. Furthermore, the OR estimate was calculated considering as the control group (not MMR vaccinated) also both pre- and post- MMR generation groups. Estimates were again not signicant (OR 0.626; 95% CI 0.323 to 1.200). Comparison of regression cases observed within the MMR generation group (independent from documented vaccination status) with that observed in pre- MMR, post-MMR and pre- plus post-MMR groups did not pro- vide statistically signicant OR estimates. Case-control studies The risk of an association between the MMR vaccine and autism was investigated in three case-control studies ( DeStefano 2004 ; Mrozek-Budzyn 2010 ;Smeeth 2004 ). The study by Smeeth 2004 assessed the association between ex- posure to the MMR vaccine and the onset of autism and other PDDs ( Table 9 ). The study was based on data from the UK's Gen- eral Practice Research Database (GPRD) which was set up on 1 June 1987. The authors concluded that their study added to the evidence that MMR vaccination was not associated with an in- creased risk of PDDs. The OR for the association between MMR vaccination and PDDs was 0.78 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.97) for the non-practice matched control group and 0.86 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.09) for the practice matched control group. The ndings were similar when analysis was restricted to children with a diagno sis of autism only, to MMR vaccination before their third birthday , or to the period prior to media coverage of the hypothesis link ing MMR vaccination with autism. DeStefano 2004 compared the distribution of ages at rst MMR vaccination in children with autism (cases, Table 9 ) and controls, divided into three age strata: up to 18, 24 and 36 months. The authors concluded that there was no signicant difference betwe en cases and controls in the age at rst vaccination up to 18 months (adjusted OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.38) and 24 months (adjusted OR 1.01; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.67); but more cases received MMR vaccination before 36 months (adjusted OR 1.23; 95% CI 0.64 to 2.36; unadjusted OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.14), possibly reflecting the immunisation needs of children in a surveillance programme. In the study by Mrozek-Budzyn 2010 cases of autism in children aged between two and 15 years were identied by means of gen- eral practitioners' records from Ma opolska Province in southern Poland ( Table 9 ). For each case, two controls matching for birth year, gender and practice were selected. A total of 92 cases with childhood or atypical autism and 192 matched controls were in- cluded. Estimate OR were calculated considering vaccine exposure(MMR or monovalent measles) before autism diagnosis or befor e symptoms onset separately in univariate and multivariate a nalysis (this latter balanced for mother age 35 years, gestation time 38 weeks, medication during pregnancy, perinatal injuries and ve- minute Apgar score). In multivariate analysis, administrati on of MMR vaccine before the diagnosis was associated with a relevant reduced risk of autism (OR 0.17; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.52; P = 0.002); this association was not conrmed when exposure before symp- tom onset was considered (OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.15 to 1.16). Risk of autism was signicantly lower for MMR vaccinated children when compared with children immunised with single component measles vaccine, both before diagnosis (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.99) and symptom onset (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.91). Time-series studies Fombonne 2006 analysed the trend of pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) prevalence in cohorts born from 1987 to 1998 attending a school board in the south and west parts of Montrea l (n = 27,749 on 1 October 2003). The relationship between PDD prevalence trends and MMR vaccination coverage through each birth cohort was assessed. Children with PDDs (n = 180) were identied from a special list that was lled with data of childr en identied by code 51 (autism) and by code 50 (autism spectrum disorder) to allow the schools to receive incremental funding. The authors reported that while a signicant trend toward a decrea se in MMR uptake through birth cohorts from 1988 to 1998 ( X2 for trend = 80.7; df= 1; P < 0.001) could be assessed, a signicant increase in rates of PDDs from 1987 to 1998 was found (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.16; P < 0.001). By comparing the rate of increase in PDDs prevalence between the one-dose and two-dose period, no statistically signicant differences were detected . A Japanese study ( Honda 2005 ) assessed the trend of autistic spec- trum disorders (ASDs) incidence among birth cohorts from 1988 to 1996 (Yokohama city, Central Japan) up to seven years of age , in relation to the decline of MMR vaccination coverage in the same birth cohorts, i.e. before and after termination of MMR vaccina - tion programmes in children (1993). Through examination of ris k factor analysis with conditional regression, a signicant incr ease in cumulative incidence of all ASDs through birth cohorts from 1988 to 1996 has been observed ( 2= 45.17, df = 8, P < 0.0001). This trend was different before and after the 1992 birth cohor t: considering the 1996 birth cohort as a reference, incidence of all ASDs was signicantly lower until 1992 and was not different a f- ter 1993. A signicant increased incidence could be assessed also when outcomes denition of childhood autism ( 2= 31.86, df = ASD ( 2= 19.25, df = 8, P = 0.01) were considered. The authors concluded that causal hypothesis invol v- ing the MMR vaccine as a risk factor was not supported by the evidence because the ASD incidence continued to increase even if the MMR vaccination programme was terminated. 15 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Self controlled case series In the study by Makela 2002 , already described in the section relative to neurological diseases (see above), an attempt to ev alu- ate the association between MMR vaccination and hospitalisati on for autism was made ( Table 9 ). Unlike encephalitis and aseptic meningitis, instead of a risk period, changes in the overall n umber of hospitalisations for autism after MMR vaccination, includi ng only the rst hospital visit during the study period, were con sid- ered. Times between immunisation and hospitalisation obse hospitalisations for autism following MMR im- munisation were very wide (range three days to 12 years and ve months), their numbers remained relatively steady during th e rst three years and then decreased gradually. No cluster interval s from vaccination could be identied. Authors concluded that there was no evidence of association, but did not report statistical data sup- porting this conclusion. One other self controlled case series study ( Taylor 1999 ) assessed clustering of cases of autism by post-exposure periods in a cohor t of 498 (with 293 conrmed cases) children. The authors reported a signicant increase in onset of parental concern at six months po st- vaccination, but no signicant clustering of interval to diagno sis or regression was found within any of the considered time peri ods (two, four, six, 12, 24 months). Asthma Cohort studies The cohort study by McKeever 2004 used an historical birth co- hort of children (1988 to 1999) consisting of 29,238 children of both sexes aged between 0 and 11 years and identied through t he West Midlands General Practice Research Database (GPRD), to investigate the association between MMR and diphtheria, pol io, pertussis and tetanus (DPPT) vaccination and asthma or eczema (Table 11 ). Incident diagnoses of asthma/wheeze and eczema (Table 11 ) were identied using the relevant Oxford Medical In- formation System (OMIS, derived from ICD-8) and Read codes (a hierarchical code used in GP practices in England). Association with MMR vaccine exposure and risk of asthma and eczema has been assessed by univariate analysis. Correspondent crude h azard ratios (HR) were 3.51 (95% CI 2.42 to 5.11) and 4.61 (95% to 6.74) for asthma and eczema, respectively. Stratifyin g for GP consultation frequency in the rst 18 months, HR estimates remain signicant only for the subgroup with lower consulting frequency (zero to six times in the rst 18 months) and not for the other subgroups (seven to 10 times, 11 to 16 times and more than 16 times): HR 7.18 (95% CI 2.95 to 17.49) for association between MMR vaccination and asthma; HR 10.4 (95% CI 4.61 to 23.29) for association between MMR vaccination eczema, respectively.One other cohort study ( DeStefano from the Vac- cine Safety Datalink (VSD) project in order to detect a possible as- sociation between asthma and some infant vaccines, among which was MMR ( Table 11 ). For the study, a population of children who were enrolled in four Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs ) from birth until at least 18 months of age (to a maximum of six years) between 1991 and 1997 was considered (n = 167,240). Asthma cases (n = 18,407) were identied by reviewing comput- erised databases maintained at each HMO (see Table 11 for case denition). Ascertainment of vaccine exposure was performed by using computerised immunisation tracking systems maintaine d by each of the HMOs. Out of the 167,240 included participants 12,426 were not immunised with the MMR vaccine. Proportional hazard regression does not show a signicant association betw een asthma and MMR vaccination (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04). Person-time cohort studies Association between asthma hospitalisation, anti-asthma me dica- tions ( Table 11 ) and MMR vaccine exposure was tested on Danish birth cohorts from 1991 to 2003 in the Hviid 2008 study, by using the Danish Civil Registration System. Each participant record ed in the register had an identication number, that allowed a li nk to data contained in other national registers (Danish National H os- pital Register, Danish Prescription Drug Database and Natio nal Board of Health). MMR vaccination status was considered as a time-varying variable and individuals could contribute to per son- time as both unvaccinated and vaccinated participants. MMR vac- cination is protective against all asthma hospitalisation (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.73 to 0.78); the protective effect of vaccination was greater in younger children (no more signicant when the vac- cine was administered after 18 months of age), in those with the longest time spent at the hospital (18 days to one year), in girl s, in low birth-weight children, in children with one older sibling a nd in those living in rural areas. The vaccination was also protect ive against hospitalisation for severe asthma (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0. 49 to 0.82), even if estimates were not signicant within the foll owing stratications: age three or four fully immunised chil dren; hospitalisation propensity; male sex; weight bel ow g or above 4000 g; birth order >/= three; birth in the capital or in a rural area. T otal use of anti-asthma medications was less freq uent among participants immunised with MMR (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.91 to 0.92). No reduction in use (all medications) was observed for participants vaccinated at ages between 23 and 26 months (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01) or at 27 months or later (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.03). Considering single classes of medication in the unstratied study population, these data were conrme d with the exception for systemic b2-agonists, for which reductio n in use could not be observed (RR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.02). Considering only the rst use of any anti-asthma medication in the unstratied population, the RR was 0.93; 95% CI 0.92 to 0.94. 16 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Leukaemia The case-control study of Ma 2005 was realised within the North- ern California Childhood Leukaemia Study (NCCLS) and as- sessed whether vaccination with MMR (and other vaccines) plays a role in the aetiology of leukaemia. In NCCLS (active since 1995 ) incident cases of newly diagnosed leukaemia in children aged be - tween 0 and 14 years and ascertained from major paediatric clin ical centres within 72 hours after diagnosis were collected ( Table 12 ). Analyses had been carried out for both total leukaemia cases an d control (323 and 409, respectively) and for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) subset (282 cases and 360 controls). Consider- ing leukaemia as case denition, OR estimates for any MMR dose before the reference date in all populations was 1.06 (95% CI 0. 69 to 1.63). Considering ALL as case denition the OR estimate for any MMR dose before the reference date in all populations was 0.87 (95% CI 0.55 to 1.37). Hay fever T ( Bremner 2005 ;Bremner 2007 ) inves- tigated the risk of hay fever in MMR-vaccinated children in the UK (using the same data source). Bremner 2005 focused particular attention on the timing of MMR vaccination to identify a critical period for MMR immunisation and hay fever risk (see Table 13 for denition). The nested case- control study was conducted within two large databases, the Gen - eral Practice Database (GPRD) and Doctors' Independent Net- work (DIN) and involved 7098 hay fever cases and controls. After performing a conditional logistic regression the authors re ported that infants who received MMR vaccination did not have a greater or lesser risk of developing hay fever than unvaccinated childr en. MMR unvaccinated children compared with vaccinated in month 14 (base group) had an OR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.08). A reduced risk of hay fever was noted after completing MMR after two years of age (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.80). Bremner 2007 specically investigated if exposure to MMR vacci- nation during the rst grass pollen season of life influences t he risk of hay fever more than any other time of the year. The study was conducted within GPRD and DIN Databases and involved 7098 hay fever cases matched with controls. The risk of later hay feve r following exposure to MMR vaccine within the rst grass pollen season of life was not statistically different from that obse rved when MMR administration occurred outside of it (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.18; P = 0.38). T ype 1 diabetes Hviid 2004 was a retrospective cohort study carried out in Den- mark aiming to evaluate if there was an association between chi ld- hood vaccinations and the onset of type 1 diabetes. A cohort of children born from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2000 from the Danish Civil Registration System was individuated. The Dan- ish Civil Registration System identied with a unique numbe r allpeople living in Denmark. This number made it possible to ob- tain linked information on vaccination, diagnosis of type 1 di a- betes ( Table 14 ), the presence or absence of siblings with type 1 diabetes and potential confounding factors. The vaccination da ta were obtained from the National Board of Health, where the Ge n- eral Practitioners reported data. The results of this study d o not sustain the hypothesis that there is a link between vaccinatio ns and type 1 diabetes (measles, mumps and rubella (all children): rate ratio 1.14; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.45). Gait disturbance Association between MMR vaccination and gait disturbance was assessed by means of a self controlled case series study ( Miller 2005 ) and considered as cases hospital admissions or general practice consultations in children within the Thames regions of Englan d. Hospital admission cases were obtained from hospital comput- erised records for the period April 1995 to June 2001, consider ed those relative to children aged 12 to 24 months with ICD-10 diag - noses related to acute R26, R27 , were validated by reviewing hospita l case notes and grouped into ve categories ( Table 15 ). Vaccination history of cases was obtained from immunisation records. In al l, 127 cases with available immunisation status were identied . Out of these, 65 belonged to category 4 (i.e. non-ataxic, non-viral or i- gin) and were excluded from analysis. No cases corresponding to category 1 denition were found. Relative incidence (RI) within and outside post-vaccination time risk (0 to 30 and 31 to 60 days) was calculated after age stratication in one-month intervals. RI estimates for pooled two, three and ve categories were not st a- tistically relevant (RI 0.83; 95% CI 0.24 to 2.84 for 0 to 30 days risk time and RI 0.20; 95% CI 0.03 to 1.47 for 31 to 60 days risk time). As gait disturbance does not require hospitalisation, autho rs car- ried out a further analysis based on cases observed in General Prac- tices using the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) as the source, and considered children aged 12 to 24 months, born be- tween 1988 and 1997. Read and OXMIS codes indicating a possi- ble consult for gait disturbance were identied in GPRD by map- ping ICD-9 codes 'gait', - ordination', 'mobility' and 'movement'. Diagnoses ouped into six categories ( Table 15 ). Vaccination history was obtained from prescription records. In all, 1398 children with diagnose s A- F and known immunisation history were included. Since, in the authors' opinion, a vaccine-specic effect would appear one week after immunisation (an excess of B and C diagnoses was observed on vaccination day) the risk period zero to day ve was separate ly considered. In any other considered risk periods (six to 30, 31 t o 60 and six to 60 days after MMR immunisation) RI did not have a statistically relevant increased incidence. Early administr ation of thiomersal-containing DTP/DT vaccine did not influence this estimate. 17 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Crohn's disease and inflammatory bowel disease T wo studies ( Davis 2001 ;Seagroatt 2005 ) considered the hypoth- esis of an association between MMR vaccination and Crohn's dis- ease (CD) or inflammatory bowel disease and ulcerative colitis (Table 16 ). One case-control study ( Davis 2001 ) was conducted in the United States using data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) to eva l- uate if MMR and measles-containing vaccines increased the risk for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Medical records were re- viewed and cases were classied according to the type of disease (CD, ulcerative colitis/proctitis or IBD). The authors concluded that exposure to the MMR vaccine was not associated with an in- crease risk of CD (OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.08 to ulcerative colitis One ) investigated a possible as- sociation between the MMR vaccine and CD. Using English na- tional data on emergency admissions, the authors compared ad- missions for CD in populations with a vaccination coverage of 84% with populations with a MMR vaccination coverage of 7%. The estimated rate ratio for the MMR vaccination pro- gramme was 0.95 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.08). Even if age-specic rates of emergency admission for CD increased during the time con- sidered in the study (April 1991 to March 2003), this trend seems not to have been influenced by the introduction of the MMR vac- cine. The introduction of the MMR vaccination programme in England did not increase the risk of CD. Demyelinating diseases The possible association between the MMR vaccine and demyeli- nating diseases was assessed in two studies, using the same p opu- lation data set. Ahlgren 2009a is a cohort study carried out in the Gothenburg area (Swedish west coast, 731,592 residents on 31 December 2000). Cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated syndro me (CIS) in participants born between 1959 and 1990 with onset at ages between 10 and 39 years before July 1984 among Gothen- burg residents were considered, corresponding to a total of 5. 9 million person-years of observation ( Table 17 ). The incidence of probable or denite MS (Poser criteria) and CIS (372 and 162 cases, respectively) was analysed in corresponding measles, m umps and rubella vaccination programmes, by selecting four birth co- horts corresponding to the rst years of a specic vaccination pr o- gramme. Birth cohorts 1962 to 1966 (102 MS cases): administration of the monovalent rubella vaccine to 12-year old girls in 1974. Birth cohorts 1970 to 1973 (62 MS cases): administration of the MMR vaccine at 12 years of age (1982). Birth cohorts 1974 to 1978 (37 MS cases): administration of monovalent measles vaccine in pre-school children. (It was already introduced in 1971, thus adequate coverage was reachedonly for those born in 1974 and onwards). About 90% of subjects from these birth cohorts received the MMR vaccine at 12 years of age. Born between July 1981 and June 1984 (ve MS cases): administration of the MMR vaccine at 18 months and at 12 years of age. The incidence of MS and CIS within each birth cohort was com- pared to that calculated for the preceding ones, including that o f 1959 to 1961, corresponding to the pre-vaccine era. No signi- cant changes in age and gender-specic incidence of MS between selected and preceding selected cohorts has been observed. Authors use the same population incidence data in order to asse ss an association between MMR exposure and MS onset by means of a case-control design ( Ahlgren 2009b ). Similar to the cohort study, case denitions included MS or CIS according to Poser's criteria, residence in Gothenburg, birth date between 1959 an d 1986, and disease onset from the age of 10 years onwards. For analysis of vaccine exposure, only cases and controls who attend ed the sixth grade in school (12 years) within the study area, for w hom CHSH records were available (206 cases and 888 controls) were included. Estimates (OR) were calculated by using a logistic mod el including sex and year of birth, using MMR vaccine exposure as a dependent variable. Exposure to the MMR vaccine (in all) was not statistically different among cases and controls (OR 1.13; 95% C I 0.62 to 2.05). Bacterial and viral infections The incidence of viral and bacterial infection following MMR ad- ministration was investigated by means of a self controlled ca se se- ries design by Stowe 2009 . Episodes of hospitalisation for bacterial or viral infections occurring in children aged between 12 and 23 months, were identied by consultation of computerised hospi tal admission records from North, East and South London, Essex, East Anglia, Sussex and Kent using ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes and covering the time between 1 April 1995 and 1 May 2005 (2077 admission in 2025 children). Bacterial infections were characterised as lobar pneumonia or i n- vasive bacterial infection, whereas those of viral aetiology were en- cephalitis/meningitis, herpes, pneumonia, varicella cellaneous virus ( Table 18 ). Admissions were linked to date of MMR (and meningococcal) immunisation resulting from records held on child health systems. 'At risk' time periods were consi dered the intervals of 0 to 30, 31 to 60 and 61 to 90 days after immuni- sation. Admissions for lobar pneumonia were less frequent i n the time between 0 and 30 days after MMR immunisation (RI 0.65; 95% CI 0.48 95% CI 0.64 to 0.93). No signicant differences were found comparing incidence of invasive bacterial diseases i n risk periods with that of background period. Regarding viral infec- tions, a signicantly lower incidence of varicella zoster in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.to 0.99). However, RI estimates were not statistically releva nt for the 31 to 60, 61 to 90 and the whole 0 to 90 days risk periods. On the contrary, the risk of hospitalisation due to herpes inf ection was higher in the risk time interval between 31 and 60 days aft er MMR vaccine administration (RI 1.69; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.70) but this risk was not signicant considering the other risk per iods. Hospitalisation risk for encephalitis/meningitis, viral p neumonia and miscellaneous viral infections, did not reach statistical s ignif- icance in any of the considered risk time intervals. No signican t risk of both bacterial and viral infection has been detected fol low- ing concomitant administration of MMR and meningococcal C vaccine. D I S C U S S I O N Summary of main results MMR vaccination would be highly effective ( 95%) in prevent- ing clinical measles cases in preschool children and estimates we re similar for each of the two measles strains with which participa nts had been immunised (Schwarz or Edmonston-Zagreb, one cohort study, n = 2745). The MMR vaccine (unspecied composition) is also about 98% effective in preventing laboratory-conrmed cas es in children and adolescents (one cohort study, n = 184). Effec- tiveness in preventing secondary measles cases among househo ld contacts was 92% for one and 95% for two vaccine doses (one cohort study, n = 175). Effectiveness of at least one dose of a Jeryl Lynn-containing MM R vaccine in preventing clinical mumps cases in children and adoles- cents has been estimated between 69% and 81% (one cohort and one case-control study, n = 1656). Effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn con- taining MMR in preventing laboratory-conrmed mumps cases in children and adolescents was estimated to be between 64% to 66% for one and 83% to 88% for two vaccine doses (two case-control studies, n = 1664). At least one dose of Urabe strain-containing MMR is 70% to 75% effective in preventing clinical mumps (one cohort and one case-control study, n = 1964) and 87% effective against laboratory-conrmed mumps (this last estimate was pro - vided from only one small cohort study with high bias risk, n = 4 8). Vaccination with MMR prepared with Urabe strain has demon- strated to be 73% effective in preventing secondary mumps cases (one cohort study, n = 147). In any case, there was an acceptably high effectiveness of the vaccine prepared only with Urabe or Je ryl Lynn strain but not so for that containing Rubini strain. We found no studies assessing effectiveness of MMR against rubella. Association with Leningrad-Zagreb mumps strains on the basis of two very large time-series studies with moderate risk of bias and carried out on about 1,500,000 children aged one to11 years, assessing a signicant increased risk in the time bet ween one and 10 weeks after immunisation, peaking within the thir d or fth week. Association was not signicant for vaccines prepared with mumps Jeryl Lynn strains, as it results from one cohort an d one self controlled case series studies. Due to the results of a well conducted, very large person-time cohort study involving 537,171 children between three months and ve year of age, febrile seizure (as rst or as recurrent epi sode) has been found to be associated with MMR vaccine (prepared with Moraten, Jeryl Lynn and Wistar RA) within two weeks afte r administration in preschool Danish children. In children aged 12 to 23 months, association with febrile convu l- sion six to 11 days after immunisation, would have been asses sed for MMR containing both Jeryl Lynn or RIT 4385 mumps strains in a self controlled case series study with moderate bias risk (n = 894). Increased risk of severe illness with fever and convulsions in chil- dren aged 12 to 35 months within six to 11 days after MMR expo- sure was assessed in one further self controlled case series st udy in which the vaccine strain composition was not reported (n = 107). Association with acute or idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpu ra within six weeks from immunisation was assessed in four stud ies (two case-controls, n = 2450, one self controlled case series, n = 63 ) but vaccine composition was not described in any of the studies. Based on the identied studies, no signicant association coul d be assessed between MMR immunisation and the following condi- tions: autism, asthma, leukaemia, hay fever, type 1 diabete s, gait disturbance, Crohn's disease, demyelinating diseases, bact erial or viral infections. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence External validity of included studies was also low. Descripti ons of the study populations, response rates (particularly in non -ran- domised studies), vaccine content and exposure (all important indicators of generalisability) were poorly and inconsisten tly re- ported. In addition, inadequate and inconsistent descriptio ns of reported outcomes (a well-known problem ( Kohl 2001 )), variable observation periods and selective reporting of results contr ibuted to our decision not to attempt pooling data by study design. Quality of the evidence We found problematic internal validity in some included stud ies and the biases present in the studies (selection, performance, attri- tion, detection and reporting) influenced our condence in their ndings. The most common type of bias was selection bias. We analysed reasons presented by the papers to justify missing data. Despite accepting as 'adequate' explanations such as 'non-resp onse 19 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.to questionnaire' and 'medical records unavailable', not all reports offered adequate explanations for missing data. Potential biases in the review process There are some weaknesses in our review. The age limit of part ic- ipants, although substantially justied by public health co ncerns about the effects of vaccination on the developing child, did lea d us to exclude some studies only on this basis. Additionally, t he methodological quality tools used to assess the ecological, ti me- series and case-only designs have not to our knowledge been em- pirically tested. We believe this to have had minimal impact on our ndings given the size and nature of the biases present in the design and reporting of the included studies. The range of differing study designs used by authors is partl y a re- flection on the lack of control children not exposed to MMR, due to the population nature of vaccination programmes. As MMR vaccine is universally recommended, recent studies are constrai ned by the lack of a non-exposed control group. This is a methodolog- ically difculty which is likely to be encountered in all compara- tive studies of established childhood vaccines. We were unable to include a majority of the retrieved studies because a comparabl e, clearly-dened control group or risk period was not available. The exclusion may be a limitation of our review or may reflect a more fundamental methodological dilemma: how to carry out mean- ingful studies in the absence of a representative population not exposed to a vaccine that is universally used in public health p ro- grammes. Whichever view is chosen, we believe that meaningful inferences from individual studies lacking a non-exposed contr ol group are difcult to make. The hypothesis that secondary vaccine failure (waning immunity ) could occur and increase over the years after the last immunisa- tion, has been considered in some studies but it needs to be bet ter elucidated. T wo studies ( Briss 1994 ;Hersh 1991 ) carried out in the USA during mumps epidemics on high school student pop- ulations having high vaccination coverage (over 97% received at least one mumps-containing vaccine dose before the outbreak), showed that risk of acquiring mumps was higher in participants who were vaccinated at least three ( Briss 1994 ) or ve years ( Hersh 1991 ) before the outbreak, than in those who were more recently vaccinated, thus this estimate was not statistically relevant . Linear regression analysis demonstrated no signicant trend for in creas- ing mumps attack rates by years, since last vaccination neither a f- ter one nor after two mumps-containing vaccine doses ( Schaffzin 2007 ). A Belgian study carried out on pupils from seven kinder- gartens and primary schools in Bruges city (age range three to 12 years) during a mumps epidemic in 1995 to 1996 ( Vandermeulen 2004 ) estimated that odds of developing mumps increased 27% per one-year increase, from one year after the last MMR immuni- sation onwards. A case-cohort study ( Cortese 2008 ) carried out at a University in Kansas (USA) during the 2006 outbreak showed that case patients were more likely than their roommates with outmumps to have received the second MMR dose more than 10 years before (odds ratio (OR) 2.50; 95% condence interval (CI) 1.28 to 5.00). Waning immunity may be secondary to a lack of natural exposure ( Cortese 2008 ;Dayan 2008a ). The group with the highest mumps incidence during the 2006 outbreak in the USA were college-age youths (18 to 24 years) born during the 1980s, when the spread of mumps was so low that many of them were never exposed to the disease. They probably received a se c- ond dose in the early 1990s, when opportunities for booster s hots against exposure to wild viruses became increasingly rare ( Dayan 2008a ). Moreover, the risk of the contracting mumps virus from abroad should be considered, because in several countries, mum ps vaccination was not routinely administered ( Cohen 2007 ;Dayan 2008a ). Apart from waning immunity it must be taken in account that mumps strains used in vaccine preparation differed phylo geni- cally from those isolated Dayan 2008a ;Dayan 2008b ). These facts could explain, at least in part, the vaccine failure observed during some mumps outbreaks. Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews Currently, this is the only review covering both effectivenes s and sa- fety issues of MMR vaccines. In agreement with results from oth er studies and reviews a signicant association between autism a nd MMR exposure was not found. The study of Wakeeld ( Wakeeld 1998 ), linking MMR vaccination with autism, has been recently fully retracted ( The Editors of The Lancet 2010 ) as Dr. Wakeeld has been found guilty of ethical, medical and scientic miscondu ct in the publication of the paper; many other authors have more- over demonstrated that his data were fraudulent ( Flaherty 2011 ). A formal retraction of the interpretation that there was a caus al link between MMR vaccine and autism has already been issued in year 2004 by 10 out of the 12 original co-authors ( Murch 2004 ). At that time (1998) an excessive and unjustied media coverage of this small study had disastrous consequences ( Flaherty 2011 ; Hilton 2007 ;Oft 2003 ;Smith 2008 ), such as distrust of pub- lic health vaccination programmes, suspicion about vaccine safe ty, with a consequential signicant decrease in MMR-vaccine cover- age and re-emergence of measles in the UK. A U T H O R S ' C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR vaccine supports current policies of mass immunisation aimed at globa l measles eradication and in order to reduce morbidity and morta lity associated with mumps and rubella. 20 Vaccines for mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Implications for research The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre and post-marketing, need to be improved and standardised denitions of adverse events should be adopte d. More evidence assessing whether the protective effect of MMR could wane with the time since immunisation should be addressed.

However, the authors co ncluded that they \"could nd no comparative studies assessing the effe ctiveness of MMR that tted [their] inclusion criteria as all had serological outcomes\" and then continued to discuss only studies of MMR vaccin e safety. The review and discussion of the safety of these vaccin es accurately reflects the literature; rather this letter is about the conclusions regarding vaccine effectiveness. The authors' conclusion that no comparative studies exist abou t the effectiveness of MMR vaccines do not seem to be borne out by other reviews of the literature. Using the stated inclusion cr iteria, one can nd several studies of the effectiveness of MMR vaccine against individual diseases (measles, mumps or rubella) usi ng cohort and case-control methods. Numerous retrospective stud ies have also documented the effectiveness of measles-containing vaccine s (vs. MMR vaccine) for preventing measles. A partial list of art icles found in PubMed using the criteria (measles OR mumps OR rubella ) AND \"vaccine efcacy\", screened for articles including calculation of clinical vaccine efcacy, follows this feedback. The authors also restricted their search to articles appearing in 1966 and later; given that measles vaccines were developed a nd used in clinical trials in the late 1950s and 1960s, the authors should strongly consider repeating their search for all years ? or, at a minimum, from 1954 to the present, given that measles virus was rst is olated in 1954. The authors fail to note that the effectiveness of measles, mu mps and rubella vaccines were documented individually before t heir combination into MMR vaccine, and that the serological correlate s of protection are well dened for protection against measles and rubella virus infections. These serological correlates of pro tection are now used to compare various vaccine virus strains and combinations. I would strongly suggest that this review be revised so that i t includes a discussion of articles that assess the efcacy of MMR v accines or the individual vaccines included in MMR vaccines against their ta rget diseases using any appropriate methodology. The autho rs could then compare the efcacy of the individual vaccines with that of th e combined vaccine. If they choose not to include any of the articles 150 Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review ) Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.found that demonstrate clinical vaccine efcacy, it would be helpf ul if the authors could provide a clear justication for doing so . At the very least, the title and introduction should be changed so that it is clear that the review is of studies of the safety of th e vaccines, not their efcacy. Thank you for your consideration of these comments Reply Dear Dr. Perry, Many thanks for the attention paid to our MMR vaccines review. W e have read with interest you observation, we must though call your attention to the fact that for Cochrane Reviews inclusion cr iteria are established rigorously from an experienced team o f specialists with the aim to made comparisons so homogeneous as possible an d to consider preferably those outcomes that have direct implica tions for decision making in Public Health. For this reason the eval uation of evidences based only on serological parameters is de batable or at least not overall accepted at the rate of their indirect natur e. It shouldn't be forgotten that our review was also performed in order to provide some responses to an important specic que stion in Public Health regarding the suspected association of MMR va ccine with serious diseases. As reported in the conclusions, vacci ne efcacy is in any case out of the question, since we consider as impo rtant point of evidence the fact that in many countries eradicati on of the targeted diseases could be achieved by means of mass immu nisation programs. We agree that studies in which single MMR antigens are tested co uld contribute some evidence, but in this review the only MMR in comparison with placebo or not intervention was considered. Ef fectiveness or efcacy of measles vaccine has been already review ed by other authors (e.g. 1, 2, 3 ; all present in DARE). Many studies out of those indicated by you in the list, report r esults of a single component vaccines and are for this reason not includible. In some of them MMR is tested, but all appear results of survey s and consequently their design is markedly affected from diff erent types of biases which would preclude in any case their inclusion i n the analysis. T o complete background information about efca cy of MMR vaccines (or of different strain combinations), we may comment briefly on the evidence from these and other similar reports in occasion of the next update of the review.
