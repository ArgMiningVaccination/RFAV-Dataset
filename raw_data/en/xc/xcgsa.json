LovelySkin Customer Verified Purchase Repeat buyer been using this product for probably 5 years can't be without it.. I always buy it from lovely skin because I can always use my after purchase they always send you a thank you card with a redeemable discount code and free shipping so.. Plus lots of goodies ig samples Laurenv2003 Verified Purchase I've been using this supplement for just under a month now. On a positive note, it doesn't upset my stomach like a lot of other supplements with similar ingredients tend to do. As far as noticeable changes re skin and body cleansing, I think it's probably too soon to notice those things. It's maybe possible that my skin has been a bit clearer this past week?? Maybe it's beginning to have some beneficial long-term effects! We shall see! Will continue to buy on auto-delivery. whimsicallady Verified Purchase I have oily acne prone skin. This helps my skin stay clear especially when I'm not eating \"perfect\"... definitely helps! spaflam Verified Purchase My last greens supplement had me taking 6 pills per day. This is just 2 pills per day - slightly different make up of greens but not irritating on my stomach. Definitely re-purchasing this. LovelySkin Customer Verified Purchase The Best Vitamins for clear healthy skin. My skin cleared up (after using this product religiously with HUM Skin Heroes) in about six weeks. Its wonderful and I cannot be without it. LovelySkin Customer Verified Purchase I'm sure it has healthy stuff in it but I didn't notice any visible difference in my skin. I won't continue to repurchase this one. goldie Verified Purchase IF U WANT GOOD INSIDES, THIS IS THE CAPSULE FOR U, CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE, NOT TO GET GROSS, BUT CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN BOWELS, ETC. DOC EVEN GAVE IT THUMBS UP. LovelySkin Customer Verified Purchase I really wanted a spirulina and chlorella supplement. This was so much better than other options, that required 5-6 capsules per serving. It's quick and easy and my skin looks so much better. DF Verified Purchase I almost finished 2 bottles but no changes. It doesn't bother my stomach like other brands but it doesn't work for my skin at all. Disappointing. LovelySkin Customer Verified Purchase This product does exactly what it says. The vegan and natural ingredients are gentle on my skin and other than clearer skin, I have had no allergic reactions like I have to other supplements. I get small whiteheads from time to time but my acne now is very manageable. ZoeWelch LovelySkin Employee This cleared up my acne that would form around my chin area. These supplements definitely helped balance the PH level of my skin, and the additional detoxing of the liver and lympathic system are great benefits! B70 Verified Purchase I've been using this one for a few weeks and I can't really tell any difference. Not sure that I'm supposed to, but I love the ingredients and replaced this one with my old supplemental just because I like the HUM line more. I do know that if I stop using this for a long period of time my face will break out. Pamela Verified Purchase I can't say enough good things about this product. This is loaded with good stuff and helps keep me regular. |Mon - Fri||9 - 5 p.m. CT| "}
