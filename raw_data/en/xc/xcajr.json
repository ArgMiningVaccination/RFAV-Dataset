Arch Dis Child 2002; 87:22-25 Aims: To determine the likelihood of finding an antivaccination site on the world wide web and to characterise their explicit claims and rhetorical appeals. Methods: Using \"vaccination\" and \"immunisation\", examining the first 10 sites displayed on seven leading search engines. Detailed examination of content of 100 antivaccination sites found on Google.Results: 43% of websites were antivaccination (all of the first 10 on Google). Main rhetorical appeals involve themes of the scientific veracity of antivaccination argument; rapport with parents seeking toprotect their children from harm; and alleged collusion between doctors, the pharmaceutical industry,and government to deny vaccine harm.Conclusions: There is a high probability that parents will encounter elaborate antivaccination mate- rial on the world wide web. Factual refutational strategies alone are unlikely to counter the highly rhe-torical appeals that shape these sites. Campaigns by those opposed to immunisation have beenfollowed by falling immunisation rates and outbreaksof vaccine preventable disease. 1The internet has provided antivaccinationists with unprecedented opportuni-ties for exposure. In the USA, 55% of adults with internetaccess use it to seek health related information. 2 For all its benets, the internet has great potential to disseminate health information that is incorrect and poten-tially dangerous. 3T o date, all studies on health information on the internet have assessed content against a priori standardsof evidence, and have not considered the rhetorical subtextsand wider social discourses in which this information isembedded. 45 We examined the content of 100 antivaccination websites, considering not only the explicit claims made about vaccina-tion, but also the ways these claims are framed to maximisetheir appeal and influence. METHODS On 23 July 2001 we entered the term \"vaccination\" and\"immunisation OR immunization\" into seven leading searchengines and examined the rst 10 sites delivered by each toestimate the probability of a person seeking information onimmunisation quickly encountering a site expressing opposi-tion to vaccines. Next, using the term \"vaccination\" on the Google search engine, 845 separate sites were returned, of which 44 werefound to contain content encouraging vaccine refusal oremphasising the dangers of vaccines. Further sites linked tothis original cohort of 44 were methodically identied in orderof discovery until 100 sites had been located (see Appendix 1,available on ADC web site: www.archdischild.com). Sites were then reviewed and their explicit claims and rhetorical appealsnoted and categorised, drawing on previous work by theauthors (see box 1). 4 RESULTS Across all seven sites, 43% of hits using \"vaccination\" returnedantivaccination sites (100% on Google) (table 1). The term\"vaccination\" was more likely to result in an antivaccinationwebsite than the terms \"immunisation or immunization\". Of the 100 sites examined, just over half represented groups or individuals concerned exclusively with opposition to vacci-nation with the remainder being alternative health, civilrights, and parenting sites containing antivaccination mate-rial. Tables 2 and 3 show the proportion of these 100 antivac-cination sites which utilised particular rhetorical appeals andwhich made various explicit claims about vaccines. Rhetorical appeals Evidence of authority and scientific rigour Antivaccination groups sought to present themselves as legitimate authorities with scientic credibility: about one infour websites implied ofcial status at national or inter-national level. A majority of sites propounded the scienticvalidity of their claims by referencing from extensive literaturedominated by self published works and the alternative medi-cine press. Allegedly damning research was often quoted, butwithout citation of its source. Referencing was frequentlyincomplete and often indiscriminate, including letters to edi-tors of newspapers and television interviews. Researchpublished in indexed medical journals was also quoted; how-ever, the conclusions drawn were often inconsistent withthose of the authors. Overall this produced a spectre of theexistence of masses of data on the dangers of vaccination. Over half of all sites cited rank breaking doctors speaking out against vaccination. Implied division within the medicalcommunity reinforced the notion of a \"debate\" amongauthorities. One third of sites promoted themselves as sourcesof non-partisan information on both sides of the immunisa-tion \"debate\". Despite these claims a mere 15% contained any information supportive of vaccination. Only a third of siteshad links to such sites. Emotive appeals \"This lovable, extremely alert baby had never produced such a blood-curdling scream as she did at the momentthe shot was given ... four hours later, Lee Ann wasdead\" (http://www.van.org.uk/index1.htm) Almost all sites featured the adversarial notion of \"us versus them\" whereby parents and antivaccinationists stood against the depersonalised \"them\" of doctors, health bodies, govern-ments, and pharmaceutical companies. Doctors were pre-sented as either willing conspirators cashing in on the vaccine\"fraud\", or pawns manipulated by the shadowy vaccine com-bine; parents' love and compassion whose intuition about vac-cination harms was considered a stronger force than cold,analytical science. Accounts of children said to be maimed orkilled by vaccines were prominent.

Many sites asserted that infectious disease was a consequence of lifestyle, not microorganisms. Evidence of conspiracy, search for truth \"[is immunisation] really designed for prevention or cure or is it planned for increasing diseases and dependencyon treatments and medicines?\" (http://home.iae.nl/users/lightnet/health/vaccination.htm)Nearly all sites referred to the antivaccination struggle as a search for truth against a background of cover up and denial.Antivaccinationists portrayed themselves as crusaders exca-vating hidden truths. The vaccination hoax was a vehicle forthe generation of limitless prot and which would produceepidemics of chronic illness, requiring billions of dollars worthof drugs and medical care. T o many groups, compulsory vacci-nation represented the beginning of the slippery slopetowards totalitarianism.Box 1 Rhetorical appeals and explicit claims Rhetorical appeals Authoritative and scientific Quasi official: organisations with names implying authority or official status \"Scientific\" references\": referenced information from established medical journals, alternative health litera- ture, published works by antivaccination \"experts\", etc Both to present \"both sides\" of the vaccina- tion debate for readers to appraise Actually present both sides: present arguments for and against vaccination Links to provaccination groups: links to government or health agencies promoting vaccination Emotive appeals Personal testimony: contain personal accounts of illness said to be caused by vaccination or persecutioncaused by antivaccination beliefs Responsible parenting: the decision not to vaccinate is in the best interests of children, and parents who refuseare acting responsibly and lovingly in accordance withparental instincts Us versus them: antivaccinationists are caring and con- cerned friends and allies of parents, together pittedagainst the collusive interests of uncaring doctors andgovernment Back to nature: \"natural\" methods of preventing disease are more desirable than the \"artificial\" practiceof vaccination, and a natural lifestyle makes vaccinationunnecessary Conspiracy/search for truth Cover up: information about vaccination is being wilfully distorted, suppressed, or otherwise withheldfrom the public Excavation of the facts: sites present allegedly reliable but hitherto neglected or hidden information thatcounters accepted wisdom about the benefits, safety,and efficacy of vaccines Free and informed choice: an informed decision about vaccination can only be made by parents in the absenceof coercion by medical authorities, and only afterbecoming familiar with the facts as presented by antivacci-nationists Foolish doctors: medical orthodoxy is ill informed and outdated against the enlightened and compassionateantivaccinationists.

Decreases in infectious disease were solely a result of social changes such asbetter sanitation. Vaccines were demonised as pollutants,alleged to cause numerous idiopathic disorders, usually ofchildren, such as sudden infant death syndrome or autism,and other feared diseases including cancer and AIDS. Vaccineswere also responsible for the rise in social \"disorders\", such asfalling literacy and violent behaviour. Being unnatural, vaccinations deranged the function of the immune system. The natural immunity provided by infectionwas considered superior. Many sites urged parents tointentionally expose their children to infectious diseasesalleging health benets. Many sites proposed that complementary health offered options for disease prevention superior to that of vaccination. DISCUSSION Anyone searching for vaccination information on the internetwill rapidly encounter florid antivaccination material. Withmany such sites masquerading as ofcial scientic sites, someweb users may not question the veracity of such material. Other researchers have criticised antivaccination websites for factual inaccuracies, 6and have examined some of the characteristics of antivaccination sites.7 The antivaccination message on the internet is far more unbridled than in other media.4For this reason the internet represents a greater potential for the public to make uninformed decisions about vaccination. Refutations based solely on \"the facts\" fail to address the core appeals that attract people to antivaccination sentimentin the rst place. 8Any response to antivaccination rhetoric must also acknowledge the wider social discourses fromwhich those arguments generate their appeal. 4 Much of the appeal of antivaccination argument lies in the genuine pain of those touched by the tragedy of childhood death or illness. Where medicine is impotent to provide a cul-prit for many idiopathic disorders, antivaccinationists can llthe void, providing answers and solidarity for parents who feelabandoned by medical authorities. A questioning of authorityand scepticism regarding the motivations of doctors and gov-ernments pervades antivaccination literature. Along with alternative health and natural parenting, antivaccination sites represent a return to an idealised, natu-ral existence. Accordingly the antivaccination message hasinltrated these movements. Concerns about immunisation reveal an individualistic ide- ology that reveres personal rights and freedoms. In a genera-tion which has rarely seen these diseases rst hand the risk ofadverse reaction seems more immediate than the biggerpicture of disease prevention. Response to the problem T o defuse conspiratorial claims the public should be madeaware of efforts to address the issue of vaccine safety throughmore active surveillance of adverse events and studies investi-gating hypothesised links between vaccination and seriouschronic diseases. 91 0 Since antivaccination websites share many of the character- istics we have described, the themes identied in this article might act as a tool for parents to discern whether the source istrustworthy. The checklist might include: Highly emotive content Conspiratorial claims Privately published material, newspapers articles, etc given as sources of information Claims to have privileged information unknown to medicalauthorities. Where refuting antivaccination arguments on the basis of fact alone is insufcient, it may be possible to use similarly emotive tactics to promote immunisation. Emphasis could begiven to images and stories of children harmed by vaccinepreventable illnesses (see, for example, http://www.immunize.org/stories/unprot.htm). .....................

POSTCARD FROM DOWN UNDER ............................................................... Cycling with myth Australia My family and friends know me as a keen cyclist and, true to form, one of my rstpurchases in Brisbane was a bicycle. Those of you who have bought a bike\u2014and thesurveys would suggest that this is signicantlymore than those of you regularly use one\u2014know that the bicycle is only the half of it, withthe accessories costing as much again. Cer-tainly in the UK you need the lights and lock,and, unless you plan to be a fair weatherpeddler, you'll need some waterproofs. Thesecan seem expensive until you compare themwith the cost of a minor service for a car. In Brisbane there are two other important things to buy before you leave the bike shop.The rst is the water bottle, which you need ifyou intend to go more than about 100 metres.The 20 ice cubes topped up with refrigeratedwater in my bottle each morning melt in lessthan two kilometres of travel. The second purchase is the cycle helmet. Many health advocates in the UK are enviousof the now nearly country wide Australianlaws regarding cycle helmet use, while healthadvocates in Australia are plainly puzzled bythe sort of pro/anti helmet debate taking placein the pages of the BMJ in December 2000. Some Myths and Truths Myth number one: All Australian cyclistswear cycle helmets. Truth: It seems to dependwho you are and where you are. Although youcan be ned for failure to wear, there is stillapparently a rite of passage where a scoff-lawteenage lad will brandish his helmet free headas a mark of maturity or badge of honour.I've only seen one person stopped andcautioned in two years on the roads and bikepaths. Myth number two: Y ou've just got to get them wearing the helmet. Truth: Y ou actuallyhave to get them wearing the helmet properly.I don't understand why, if someone is going togo to the fairly minor discomfort of wearing ahelmet, they wouldn't do up the strap. Or whythey'd wear the strap so loose it could doubleas a medallion. Or why they'd wear the helmetat a jaunty angle, exposing their forehead\u2014and frontal lobes\u2014to the world. The law herestates that the helmet should be properlyxed for good reason; however, this too ispoorly policed. Myth number three: Helmet laws reduce the number of cyclists, as a consequence ofthe negative publicity about cycle safetyduring helmet campaigns, and thus reducethe net health of the population. Truth: Tricky;very tricky. I'd have to say, though, that if this is true then Brisbane must have looked morelike Beijing prior to the introduction of thelaw. The problem is with the denominator\u2014the number of people cycling before the lawwas introduced. Moreover, are the reductionsin cycling demonstrated by some studieswithin a couple of years of the introduction ofthe law sustained after a settling-in period?Are there secular trends or other events whichalso influence cycling? As a purely subjectiveobservation, it is an unusual Saturday morn-ing when I see fewer than three or four hun-dred cyclists while I'm out on a pre-eighto'clock ride beside the river. Myth number four: Helmets increase risk taking behaviour. Truth: I have no idea, butthen I don't see why helmets should be anydifferent from any other safety measure likeanti-lock braking, seat belts, or crumplezones, so I'd have to defer to the experts.Again, very difcult to measure the denomi-nator. The other pertinent question here is\"What is risk taking behaviour?\" This is lesseasy to dene than it rst appears, especially ifyou would agree that we don't want childrento grow up having never experienced any-thing with the slightest whiff of risk about it. There are two other excellent reasons to wear a helmet on Brisbane streets. The rst isthat a sun visor can come in very handy in acity where sunburn is a serious considerationat 7 am. The second is the magpies. Thesevicious, sharp clawed birds nest in spring andregard anyone coming within 50 metres oftheir nest as an invader, upon whom to swoopand attack. The combination of startle\u2014causing wobble\u2014and the occasional scratchfrom a claw can be very challenging to some-one with a \"live and let live\" outlook on life.Half a kilometre of my path to work is agauntlet I ride daily; on a good day I'm onlystuck twice. I took local advice and paintedeyes on my helmet\u2014there is now a magpiewith a white paint circle on his wings after hedive bombed my still-drying helmet. Health messages are sometimes simple, like \"Don't smoke, you'll get sick and maybe die\".Others are much more complex, like \"We'dlike you to cycle because it is good for you, andgood for the environment. However, you placeyourself at higher risk of head injury, so we'dlike you to wear a helmet too.\" The challenge isto get this across clearly and effectively. Maybewe should import some Australian magpies tohelp tip the balance.
