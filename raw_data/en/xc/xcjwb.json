TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions around vaccine hesitancy 1 Executive summary Introduction and background We are living in an interconnected world, where social media ha ve become part of the everyday life of many individuals around the globe. People use social media to stay connected to friends and family, to share personal information, views or beliefs, or to seek information and gather other peoples' advice about certain topics, including health. T hese new communication technologies have also facilitated the recent spread of unsubstantiated negative information about vaccination online, influencing individuals' views about vaccination, their levels of confidence in differe nt vaccines and their willingness to be vaccinated or to vaccinate their children. The online spread of rumours surrounding vaccination, including adverse events following v accination , has contributed to the growth of vaccine hesitancy and in some cases ma y have contributed to disease outbreaks in unvaccinated populations. However, s ocial media also constitute an opportunity to spread positive messages about the benefits of vaccination and to restore trust in vaccination. Listening, monitoring and analysing social media conversations concerning v accination could help us to understand low vaccination acceptance and provide valuable information to counteract the spread of rumours and misinformation. In this report, social media ha ve been defined as not just a means of communication, but also a space in which people socialise. Social media are therefore seen as online environment s or platforms that see 'interaction ' as a main purpose. T his study focusses on social networking sites and content communities, which can be seen as more relevant in the context of vaccination. Aims The aim of this research project is to map, analyse and summarise knowledge and research on social media and vaccination. The key objectives were to identify preferences for using different social media platforms as a source of information on vaccination and the influence that social media have on individuals' perceptions of vaccination; to identify different social media monitoring methods or tools in the context of vaccination and their st rengths and weaknesses; to review how social media monitoring methods and information gathered from monitoring can be used to inform communication strategies, and to identify the uses, benefits and limitations of social media as an intervention tool around vaccination (i.e. to determine how effective social media are as a tool for increasing vaccination uptake). Methods In order to address th ese objectives , a systematic scoping review was commissioned by ECDC and conducted by researchers at the Vaccine Con fidence ProjectTM[1]. A comprehensive search strategy was developed, reviewed by librarians, and adapted to different databases to identify peer -reviewed and grey literature published since 2000. Two reviewers independently screened all articles by title and abstract and then by full text , based on a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. All disagreements were resolved by discussion. The articles i ncluded were divided into three groups: a) preferences for using different social media platforms as a source of information on vaccination and the influence that social media have on individuals' perceptions of vacci nation, b) social media monitoring and c) social media interventions. Data extraction was performed by four reviewers and followed by a descriptive analysis and synthesis. Results The systematic scoping review identified 115 articles: 13 on individuals' preferences for using social media as a source for vaccination information and any influence on perceptions of vaccination; 85 on social media monitoring, 15 on social media interventions, one on both social media monitoring and social media interventions, and one on both social media interventions and individuals' preferences for using social media as a source for vaccination information and any influence on perceptions of vaccination. Preferences for using different social media platforms as a source of i nformation on vaccination and the influence that social media have on individuals' perceptions of vaccination The 14 studies included in this category found that social media platforms were commonly used as a source of information for vaccination but that most of the time consulting social media had a negative influence on vaccine uptake. Population groups in different countries were found to use social media in a variety of ways, with some groups experiencing more positive influences from social media. Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 2 Social media monitoring The majority of the articles on social media monitoring were published between 2015 and 2018, and are based on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. Most of the studies were based on social media monitoring in relation to vaccination general ly, while some studies monitor ed particular vaccinations , including human papillomavirus (HPV) and measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination. The majority of studies involved conduct ing a manual search to identify social media posts on vaccination, using the search tools available within the social media networks. The second most commonly used method for identifying posts was the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs - software allowi ng two applications to talk to each other), followed by automatic monitoring systems using commercial software. Most of the keywords used to search for social media posts related to vaccination or vaccine - preventable diseases, with some studies also including negative keywords, for example side effects. While many studies only used a small number of keywords, other studies also used hashtags or longer sentences or questions. Only a very small number of studies analysed the locations of posts, mean ing that most of the studies were not limited to one country only. In most cases, geo -localisation was performed manually, for instance by screening user profiles, since Global Positioning System (GPS) information is not often available. Furthermore, most of the st udies looked at social media on a continuous basis, extracting data over a period of 1 -3 hours and for up to 16 years. Studies that were conducted at one specific point in time were mostly studies where a manual search had been carried out for the data. Sentiment analysis 1 was performed in almost all studies included in this review, with most of them conducting manual coding of data into either positive vs. negative or pro -vaccination vs anti -vaccination sentiments. Those that used automated systems to code sentiments mostly analysed Twitter using different tools to establish sentiments. Some studies also included other types of content analysis, such as qualitative thematic analyses. Finally, around half of the studies also analysed reach to understand how social media information is shared. The studies visualised data in different ways. Some studies provided recommendations for health authorities and health professionals on how to use social media monitoring, in particular to start communicating on social media platforms a nd to use social media monitoring findings to inform the development of intervention and communication strategies. Social media interventions Three types of interventions were identified: social media as a source of information about vac cination; online group discussions and interactive websites. Most of these interventions were developed and implemented by researchers in Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan and the United States. T hree studies evaluated existing interventions. The ef fects of the interventions varied and no strong impact was identified overall . This may be due to the methodological challenge of linking the specific effects and influence of social media to actual behaviour. Studies measured the effect of social media in terventions on knowledge and attitudes concerning vaccination, risk perception and concerns, intentions of being vaccinated and vaccine uptake. Discussion While social media usage has been associated with a negative impact on public views and behaviour co ncerning vaccination, it also presents many opportunities. More evidence is needed on which interventions using social media to address vaccine hesitancy are effective in different contexts. Furthermore, while many studies have been conducted on social media monitoring around vaccination, they have used different methodologies (e.g. use of manual tools to retrieve data compared to APIs or automated software; manual v ersus automated sentiment analyses) to obtain and analyse data, and these have not been eval uated. There is a need to evaluate different methodological approaches to better understand what works best and to eventually provide standardised research approaches to monitor and analyse social media. Furthermore, while the general data protection regulation (GDPR) may limit social media monitoring to publicly available dat a, this also highlight s the need for more control over what happens with data collected online. It would be helpful if a code of conduct for ethical use o f social media information could be developed to ensure that those reporting on social media monitoring results adhere to fair and responsible values. Social media monitoring is highly dependent on what platforms have to offer in terms of APIs, geo -location data, and sentiment analysis. To reduce the number of manual searches and analyses, and thereby improve the quality of social media monitoring, easier ways of accessing data should be developed, whether through APIs or through computational software. Health authorities and researchers should also reflect on the consequences for research of the constant fluidity of online information, particularly since several platforms have decided to remove anti - vaccination content. 1 The process of computationally identifying and categoris ing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral (Lexico Dictionary, Oxford University Press) TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 3 Finally, the purpose and value of s ocial media monitoring should be clearly defined. While some health authorities and researchers may try to use social media as a proxy for what the public thinks about vaccination, the reality is often much more complex. It is unclear whether social media users are representative of the general public. Social media monitoring should therefore be seen as a way of capturing the essence and the movement of online discourse around vaccination in order to better understand how it can influence public perceptions and decision - making around vaccination. Such evidence could then inform the development of targeted interventions to restore public confidence in vaccination. Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 4 1 Introduction Vaccine hesitancy is increasingly being recognised as a growing problem globall y. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledged that it constitutes one of the ten biggest threats to global health [2]. Confidence in vaccination is complex and influenced by an array of individual, social, and structural factors; it can also vary depending on the vaccines and the disease s they prevent. While highly context -depende nt on the one hand, there are growing global networks promoting vaccine hesitancy, connecting across countries and languages \u2014aided by online translation tools and social media [3]. Vaccine refusers are a loud minority and such clustering can interfere with the immunisation uptake required for herd protection , risking an increase in the burden of disease [4]. Recent measles outbreaks across Europe [5-8] demonstrate the consequences of non- vaccination and confirm recent findings that Europe is the region in the world with the least confidence in the safety and effectiveness of vaccination [9]. Continuous advancements in communication technologies such as social media have contributed to the unmediated spread of concerns about safety and adverse events following vaccination . New communication technologies allow sentiments, rumours and beliefs about vaccination to quickly diffuse among networks across the world, influencing individuals and groups online as they assess risk s and benefits of vaccinati on [10-12]. A number of studies have reviewed websites and social media for information on vaccination and found that it is of variable quality, with a predomina nce of negative or incorrect content that influence s perceptions about the risks and benefits of vaccines [13-16]. However, social media ha ve great potential to contribute positively to health communication by allowing direct interactions with individuals; enhanced availability, accessibility, and customisation of information; and individual and policy advocacy op portunities. The monitoring and measuring of content posted and shared on social media also provides an opportunity to listen to online discourses and develop targeted, audience -focused communications. There are some limitations to using social media for h ealth communication, relating to quality, confidentiality, reliability, transparency, sponsorship and privacy concerns [17,18] . Engaging on social media can also be resource- and time- intensive for institutions, requiring radical c hanges in communication strategies to focus on direct engagement with the public and provid e fast and targeted responses. Social media and new communication technologies are also rapidly evolving, and require constant adaptations to new platforms, tools and interactions between individuals. Due to these limitations, and the important shift in communication strategies that social media require, public health communities focussed on vaccination uptake and confidence have been slow and inconsistent to proactiv ely engage with and invest in social media for monitoring opinion, communicating evidence- based information and/or countering misinformation. In the absence of a savvy, strong and sustained public health presence, pseudoscience, confusing information and public rumour have fuelled strong anti -vaccine sentiment and influenced vaccination decision- making through social media in countries across the world [19,20] . There are growing efforts in the field of public health and academia to better understand what is happening on social media and how they can be used to increase vaccine confidence and mitigate concerns. ECDC commissioned the Vaccine Confidence ProjectTM (VCP) [1] to conduct a scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions around vaccination. This research project stems from the necessity to synthesise all quality research produced to inform how social media monit oring methods and analysis can be used to understand and respond to public discourse about vaccination on social media and to understand the uses, benefits and limitations of using social media as an intervention tool around vaccination. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 5 2 Background Social media ha ve been defined as ' a group of internet -based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of user generated content ' [21]. Web 2.0 refers to the new way in which software dev elopers and end- users started using the World Wide Web, where content and applications are continuously modified by all users[21] . However, when defining social media, any given description is simply one of many and each discipline contributes its own perspective on th e nature of social media. For this scoping review, we understand social media as not just a means of communication, but also a space w here people socialise. Prior to social media, conversations were either private or public, through broadcasting media. So cial media now allow the dissemination of conversations and opinions within a vast network without mediation, which has contributed to the positioning of social media as a key tool to support people's freedom of speech and expression around the world. Howe ver, this unbounded freedom to create and share content with users around the world also comes with major hazards, as it also facilitates the spread of unverified misinformation. This has been framed as the 'postmodern Pandora's box' of the internet; whereby data circulate unbounded, shared and re- shared regardless of quality [22]. Virtual and in -person social interactions are deeply entwined and any definition that tries to separate both risks inconsistency [23]. As social media are not merely a tool but a social environment in which people operate, much is s aid about the various social platforms and how they account for different social spaces. However, social media should not be seen primarily as the platforms upon which people post, but as the content posted on these platforms. Social media users directly i nfluence what social media are and what they will become - as seen in the recent decisions by certain social media platforms to censor content and change algorithms to promote or reject certain content. This also explains why social media will always be a continuously evolving environment. Recent research on social lives online show s that it is the people using social media who create what social media mean and represent rather than developers or social media platform s themselves. At the same time, research indicates the inability to understand any one social media platform in isolation. The different digital platforms must be seen as relative to each other, as people use the range of available possibilities to select specific platforms or media for particul ar genres of social interaction [23]. Social media and vaccination This new boundless information ecosystem has shaped the nature of conversations about vaccination and related concerns. Dominant and singular narratives such as ' vaccines are good' are rejected, and instead vaccine- decisions are considered ' vaccine by vaccine, disease by disease, case by case' [22]. In this context, facts from authorities and experts are suspect and non -linear dialogue (dialogue that can flow in multiple ways rather than only chronologically), is the norm [24- 26]. Largescale analyses have highlighted the importance of these social networks and trust relationships in influencing vaccine decisions [27]. As Leask et al. highlight, ' a patient's trust in the source of information may be more important than what is in the information ' [28]. Rather than consulting a single, authori tative source of information, it is more common for participants to want a variety of opinions [29] . At the same time that information is important for risk assessment and decision -making, sentiments about vaccinat ion can strongly affect individual and group vaccination decisions [30]. New digital media, social media in particular, have allowed new levels of transmission of sentiments concerning vaccines [31], with negative vaccine sentiment posts being the most liked and engaged with [32]. The rise of internet -mediated communication has also had a sign ificant impact on how fast rumours and unsubstantiated concerns can spread, feeding into the abovementioned negative vaccine sentiments travelling transnationally [30]. The amplification of risk and risk perception through social media, has led some countries and health authorities to start using social media to counter misinformation, mitigate anxiety and rebuild public trust [33]. Ireland and Denmark have recently managed to rebuild public trust in h uman papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinatio n by adopting a strategy that had social media at its core to engage parents via YouTube and Facebook . Both countries took into consideration how information about HPV vaccination was consumed online by parents and developed their strategies accordingly [33,34] . Another central advantage of using social media within the scope of public health policy is the possibility to listen, in real time, to the concerns of populations and pick up signals at a very ear ly stage. At the same time, vaccination discourses on social media need to be understood within a digital ecosystem, as users tend to be influenced by and u se a range of social media platforms to express their feelings and beliefs. This digital ecosystem r elates to a virtual environment where a community of interacting platforms is continuously growing and evolv ing which speaks to the importance of conducting social media monitoring and the valuable insights it can bring. As there are many ways of defining social media, for this scoping review we attempt to understand them within the environment of public health policy and the impacts that they can have within this field. With regard to vaccination, we understand that it is pivotal to look at the social interaction processes that may be weigh ing into decision -Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 6 making and risk assessment. Kaplan et al. classify social media into blogs, collaborative projects (e.g. Wikipedia), social networking sites (e.g. Facebook), content communities (e.g. YouTube), virtual social worlds (e.g. Second Life), and virtual game worlds (e.g. World of Warcraft) [21]. Since we define social media in this report as online environments with a strong interaction component as their main purpose , we have made the methodological decision to focus on social networking sites and content communities. We have chosen to exclude online platforms that did not have social interactions as their main purpose, even though they had some scope for user interacti on (e.g. blogs and websites with comments section s). TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 7 3 Goals and objectives The aim of this scoping review was to systematically map, analyse and summarise knowledge and research on social media and vaccination and to identify examples of how informatio n collected can inform communication and interventions to address vaccine hesitancy. We provide an overview of how social media monitoring and analysis of vaccination can support those working in public health agencies and immunisation programmes by looking at the type of social media data to collect, how social media data can be analysed and interpreted, and wha t types of intervention can be developed based on data collected to increase vaccine confidence and increase vaccination. The specific objectives of the systematic scoping review were to: identify individuals' preferences for using different social media platforms as a source of information on vaccin ation and the influence that social media has on individuals' perceptions of vaccination; identify different so cial media monitoring methods and tools in the context of vaccination and their strengths and weaknesses; review how social media monitoring met hods and information gathered from the monitoring can be used to inform communication strategies; identify the uses, benefits and limitations of social media as an intervention tool in relation to vaccination (i.e. how effective social media is as an inter vention tool for increasing vaccination). Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 8 4. Review methods Systematic scoping reviews are a relatively new method f or mapping existing literature in a given field. Systematic scoping reviews have been used to ' clarify working definitions and conceptual boundaries of a topic or field' and have been particularly useful as an exploration tool for large, complex and heterogeneous topics usually not suitable for systematic literature reviews [35,36] . While systematic literature reviews are often focused on establishing the effectiveness of interventions, systematic scoping reviews take a broader approach and aim to map international literature or to identify how research has been conducted [35]. For these reasons, it was decided to conduct a systematic scoping review to address the aims of this study and to summarise methodologies that have been used to monitor social media in relation to vaccination. The methodology used to conduct this study , as described below , was based on the work provided by Arksey et. al. and further developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute [35-37]. 4.1. Search strategy and database search Librarians at ECDC developed the search strategy , balancing feasibility and comprehensiveness and including a mix of social media and vaccine keywords. The search strategy was developed for use in Embase, and adapted for use in PubMed, and Scopus by ECDC and in Medline, PsycINFO, PubPsych, Open Grey (grey literature), and Web of Science (grey literature) by the VCP and is available in Annex 8.1 . Librarians at ECDC peer -reviewed the final search strategies for all databases. One researcher from the VCP conducted the search in all databases in December 2018 and exported all articles into Endnote. Duplicates were then removed in accord ance with guidelines provided by ECDC. 4.2. Screening and selection of articles Two reviewers independently sc reened articles included in the Endnote file by title and abstract, according to a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria: Table 1 . Inclusion and exclusion criteria for screening of articles Inclusion criteria Exclusion Study settings: no restrictions Not about vaccines, or not about human vaccines (i.e. vaccines for animals) Research topics: articles were included if they studied the following topics: methods of social media monitoring around vaccination, use of social media monitoring to address vaccine hesitancy, use of social media interventions to address vaccine hesitancy (knowledge, hesitancy, confidence, awareness or coverage) Articles with studies focusing on: Other types of media (not social media) or online resources Articles that only use social media to recruit study participants Publication years: From 2000 (incl.), to include all studies conducted on social media monitoring Publication types: Conference abstracts, editorials, commentaries, letters to the editors Location: global Types of studies Efficacy trials, pre -clinical trial research Safety research Serologic investigations, immunogenicity studies Health economic studies Languages: The VCP extracted data from and analysed articles in English, Spanish, and Italian. Vaccines: Human vaccines Study design: quantitative and qualitative studies, observational and interventional studies In this review, social media included: social networking sites and content communities (e.g. LinkedIn, Instagram, forums, or Pinterest). After articles w ere selected through title and abstract screening, the two reviewers proceeded to full text screening to confirm the final list of included studies. All disagreements between the reviewers were resolved by discussion. A summary of the search and selection process are provided with a PRISMA chart (see Figure 1) . TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 9 4.3. Data extraction and analysis During the full text article selection, articles were divided into three categories corresponding to the various objectives described above: articles describing individuals' preferences for using different social media platforms as a source of information on vaccination and the influence that social media have on individuals' perceptions of vaccination, social media monitoring articles and articles describing social media interventions to address vaccine hesitancy. Three researchers from the VCP extracted data in to an Excel spreadsheet for these three categories of articles, as per the information presented in Table 1. Table 2 .

Limitations Author/reference Year of publication and study Country of study Aims/purpose of study Study population and sample size Setting Vaccine Type of social media Methodology Intervention type and details Duration of intervention Outcomes and details Key findings Limitations Four researchers then summarised, charted and analysed the data extracted. The analysis of the included articles was mainly descriptive (see more details on the analysis conducted for each of the three types of articles below), as articles were heterogeneous and presented highly diverse purposes, methodologies and study outcomes. Preferences for use of social media platforms as a source of information on vaccination and the influence that social media have on individuals' perceptions of vaccination Articles about individual preferences regarding social media were analysed by looki ng at the use of social media to gain or share information on vaccines and the possible influence of social media on vaccine attitudes and/or uptake. Results were not ed, and the proportion of participants either using social media or being influenced by social media were listed for each study and then described in the report. Media monitoring analysis When analysing the media monitoring articles t he key focus was to describe methodologies used in different studies to monitor social media and their evaluation (if applicable). The researchers therefore provided a descriptive analysis of the type of data collection tools used to gather data from socia l media, the keywords and search strategies used (including duration of search), and the various analytical methods (sentiment or content analysis, analysis of spread, reach and interaction, and geo -location of data). Data was first extracted to an Excel s preadsheet in accord ance with the categories in Table 1; this allowed reviewers to compare results across all studies, list and identify the frequency of different methods used for social media monitoring in different studies, and identify common themes. T wo reviewers met to discuss the extraction spreadsheet, the themes identified an d the findings of this review. Suggestions from the studies o n how social media monitoring can inform vaccination communication strategies were also included. Intervention ar ticles For the intervention articles, the data w ere first categorised by type of intervention. T he VCP then recorded results for various study outcomes to provide a clear overview of the effects of the various interventions. For qualitative studies, a list of key themes was compiled and analysed. Some descriptive information was also provided, such as the number of studies reporting different types of interventions or conducted with different population groups; the names of social media platforms used most frequently by different population groups; or the methods used for monitoring social media platforms around vaccination. Some analyses were also common to all three categories, such as the types of social media described, the type of vaccines studied, and the number of articles published over time, to reflect how much attention the topic has received in recent years. Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 10 5. Review results The search across all databases generated 15 435 articles, from which 7 539 duplicates were excluded (see Figure 1 for PR ISMA chart). The remaining 7 896 unique articles were screened by title and abstract using the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed above. A total of 7 628 articles were excluded, leaving 268 articles for full text review. From these, 153 articles were excluded ( see annexes detailing reasons for exclusion) for the following reasons: article on media but not social media monitoring (n=96), no data provided in the article (n=19), about websites or mobile apps but not social media (n=26), conference abstracts or editorials/letters to the editors (n=6), article containing data already published in another included article (n=1), article not looking at vaccination (n=1). Additionally, the full text of four articles on social media monitoring w as not accessible, even after making enquiries with multiple libraries. At the end of the screening process, a total of 115 articles was included for analysis: 13 articles looking at individuals' preferences for using social media as a source for vaccination information and the influence that social me dia have on individuals' perceptions of vaccination , 85 articles on social media monitoring, 15 articles on social media as an intervention tool around vaccination, one article that looked at both an intervention an d individuals' preferences for using s ocial media as a source for vaccination information, one article that combined social media monitoring and a social media intervention.

Annex 8.2 provides an overview of the studies relating to the use of social media to gain or share information about vaccines and the possible influence of social media on vaccine attitudes and/or uptake. 5.1.1 Preferences regarding the use of s ocial media as a source of information on vaccination Several studies pointed to social media as a source of health -related information : Five out of seven parents in one US study US cited social media as a common resource for information [38]. Another study in the US found that 62% of adults questioned used Facebook t o find information on the influenza vaccine , compared to 15% for Twitter [39]. In a survey of undergraduate students in Seoul, South Korea 30% of the respondents cited social media as a source for information on HPV [40]. In the UK, a study found that in a group of 626 parents who used the Internet to find information about vaccinations , 13% used Facebook or Twitter and 6% used discussion forums [41]. Another study in the UK focused on pregnant women using social media and fo und that 21% of the participants used social media to find information on vaccinations during their pregnancy, with Facebook and WhatsApp being the most popular platforms [42]. Limited use of social media as a source of information A Canadian study found that 68% of participating medical students had never us ed social networking sites such as Facebook or MySpace to obtain health -related information [43]. Similarly, university student participants in a study in Northern Irelan d reported social media to be their least preferred source of information on awareness of meningitis and vaccines [44]. A dissertation fr om the US reported that although 66% of parents had seen information about HPV vaccination on social media, only 4% had actively used social media as their main source of information about HPV vaccination (a lower percentage than those using information fr om friends and government health organisations) [45]. A US study found that 11% of parents who had heard HPV vaccine stories found them on social media and these accounts were more likely to be negative 'stories of harm' than content through other information channels [46]. Regard ing overall use of social media, a study conducted among medical students in Canada found that while 66% of participants sometimes or often used YouTube, 24% reported sometimes looking for health -related information on the platform, and only 2% reported always doi ng so [43]. Furthermore, 42% reported using YouTube for health purposes, including educational purposes, but 17% were uncertain about the platform's trustworthines s and 36% reported minimal trust in health content provided on YouTube [43]. Willingness to share information on social media None of the female students in one s tudy on a university campus in the United States shared HPV information on Facebook, 71% of them were willing to do so in the future [47]. One Spanish study also looked at the willingness of medical students to use /follow /participate in Facebook pages promoting influenza vaccination. They found that 63% of students would accept an invitation to follow a Facebook page with formal or technical content on the healthcare worker infl uenza vaccination campaign , while 65% would accept an invitation to follow a Facebook page that communicate d the same information informally (such as animations or offbeat news) [48]. In all, 19% of the students would actively participate in a 'technical' Facebook page , compared to 28% of students who would actively participate in an 'informal' Facebook page [48]. Key messages Preferences regarding the use of social media as a source of information on vaccination : Between 4 and 62% of various study populations in different countries use social media as a source of information on vaccination, with results varying by type of social media platform. Overall Facebook was the most common social media resource for information on vaccination. Social media u sers' perceptions of vaccination: Most studies suggest a negative relationship between social media use and vaccination uptake and attitudes, which could sometimes be explained by the important presence of negative content concerning vaccination online. Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 12 5.1.2 Social media as a n influence on perceptions of vaccination Several studies considered not only individuals' preferences for social media use but also how this usage influenced their perception s of vaccination, such as their attitudes and/or uptake of vaccination. Most of these studies suggested a negative relationship between various social media use and vaccination uptake, while others suggested the potential for the positive influence of soci al media on vaccination uptake. Seven of these specifically referred to Facebook, four referred to Twitter and seven did not specify a social media network or platform. Negative relationship between social media and vaccination attitude and/or uptake: A study in the UK that asked pregnant or recently pregnant women how they searched for information on vaccinations during pregnancy found that 12% of participants believed the information they found on social media influenced their vaccination decisions [42]. This influence manifested in a significantly negative relatio nship in relation to pertussis vaccination, with women who used social media to gather information being 58% less likely to receive this vaccination during pregnancy [42]. Another study in the UK reported that parents who used social media , such as discussion forums and Facebook or Twitter , were more likely to report that they had come across some material that made them doubt vaccinations (31% of parents who used discussion rooms and 23% of parents who used Facebook or Twitter versus 8% of all participating parents) [41]. Similarly, three studies in the US found social media had a neg ative influence on parents' perceptions of vaccines [49] [45]. In one of these studies, 10% of the participating parents and guardians felt that social media increased their sentiments of fear around the HPV vaccination [45] . Another study about the HPV vaccine conducted in Seoul reported that undergraduate students felt the information t hey obtain ed about the vaccine via social media increased their perception of barriers to receiving it [40]. In the UK, a study considered social media as one of the various intervention strategies used to increase influenza vaccine uptake in heal thcare workers over the course of four years. The researchers in this study reported a significantly reduced vaccination uptake when using promotions on Facebook (22%) and Twitter (24%) as an intervention, although no reflection on the reason for these res ults was provided [50]. In India, a study was conducted to assess the influence o n trust of a large measles- rubella vaccination campaign in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. This study found that most parents who rejected th e vaccine for their children also placed higher levels of trust in social media platforms, including WhatsApp[51] . Positive relationship between social media and vaccination attitude and/or uptake A study on vaccines during pregnancy in the UK found that women who used W hatsApp and LinkedIn were more likely to receive both the influenza and pertussis vaccines while pregnant [42]. A study in the US found that participants who used Facebook or Twitter as sources of health information were more likely to be vaccinated [39]. Participants from another study in the United States proposed using social media to circulate positive messaging about the HPV vaccine [38]. 5.2 Social media monitoring There is a growing body of literature describing social media monitoring methods. For this report the results of the social media monitoring are organised into three major phases (see Figure 2): 1- preparation , 2- data extraction and 3 - data analysis. Figure 2 . Social media monitoring phases TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 13 Articles on social media monitoring in this review were therefore reviewed in accord ance with t he following three phases: 1. Preparation : Characteristics of the studies in this report - purpose of social media monitoring and p latforms monitored Ethics approval 2. Data extraction : Data extraction tools Period of monitoring Search strategies Visualisation of data 3. Data analysis: Geo-localisation Reach Trends, content and sentiments 5.2.1 Preparation Study characteristics A total of 86 articles monitored and analysed social media in relation to vaccination (see Annex 8.3 for a table summarising the characteristics and methods used in these articles). While the first study was published in 2006, only a very small number of studies were published between 2006 and 2014. In 2015, the number of published articles about social media monitoring increased substantially, with 83% of all articles identified in this review published since 2015. Nine studies were published in 2015 (11%), 14 in 2016 (16%), 25 in 2017 (29%) and 21 in 2018 (24%). As the search was conducted in December 2018, only two articles, available ahead of print, were identified for 2019. Purpose of social media monitoring It is imp ortant to establish the purpose of analysing social media information on vaccination as this will influence how and which data are collected. For the majority of studies (55/86, 64%) the goal was to increase understanding of how vaccination is portrayed on social media, through online discourse, sentiment or the way in which information is produced, engaged with and shared. Other aims included monitoring the reaction after an outbreak, monitoring the impact of a campaign or intervention or a vaccination programme, monitoring misinformation or monitoring public concerns and questions. Key messages In 2015, the number of articles published on social media monitoring increased substantially, with 83% of all articles identified in this review published sinc e 2015. The large increase in the number of articles from 2015 was mostly attributed to an increase in studies conducted on Twitter. Purpose The purpose of analysing information about vaccination online will influence how and which data are collected. Dif ferent purposes were identified: increasing understanding of how vaccination is portrayed on social media through online discourse, sentiment or how information is produced, shared and engaged with; monitoring the reaction after an outbreak; monitoring th e impact of a campaign or intervention or a vaccination programme; monitoring misinformation; monitoring public concerns and questions in general or over time. Types of social media A large majority of studies focused on Twitter, followed by YouTube, Facebook and various online forums. Ethics The questions relating to ethics approval to perform social media monitoring research are growing. In addition, a number of studies raised the issue of posts not being publically available. Out of the 86 articles on social media monitoring, only 13 (15%) explicitly mentioned having received approval from an institutional ethics review board. S ome of the other studies considered that they were exempt from institutional/ethical review as their studies did not direct ly involve human subjects or because social media analysis only included publically available data. Other researchers believe that anonymization is not enough and they urge that other solutions should be found due to the fact that private data can easily b e revealed. Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 14 Type of social media monitored A large majority of studies focused on Twitter (n=42) [30,52- 92], followed by YouTube various online forums (n=9) [114- 122]. The forums included in the studies reviewed in this report were babytree (China), Iltalehti and KaksPlus (Finland), Mothering.com (UK), and Mumsnet (UK). Additionally, five studies either used multiple forums from the same country identified by a Google search, forums specifically designed for a particular event or study, or failed to name the forum analysed. Other type s of social media monitored additional seven studies monitored a mix of social media networks, including Digg, Hyves, Facebook, unspecified forums, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube[128- 134]. A description of all the different social media platforms monitored across the 86 studies is provided in Table 3 . Table 3 . Description of the social media platforms identified in the scoping review Digg Platform allowing users to post, save and share news stories and to vote content up or down. Facebook Platform used for social networking, allowing users to create profiles with personal information about themselves, and to post, interact, comment or share messages, photos, videos and other media content with other members (friends or followers). The platform also allows groups and professional pages to be cre ated, with comments, likes and shares of these posts across both personal profiles and group/pages (depending on privacy settings). Forums Type of social media platforms allowing users to write content in message boards or online discussion sites/threads. The forums included in the studies reviewed in this report were babytree (China), Iltalehti and KaksPlus (Finland), Mothering.com (UK), and Mumsnet (UK). Hyves Platform used for social networking, allowing users to interact with other members (Dutch equivalent of Facebook, discontinued in 2013). LinkedIn Platform used for professional networking and for posting jobs and/or curricul um vitae or sharing content in the form of short messages, images, videos or links. Pinterest Platform for posting, interacting with and sharing images/articles, referred to as pins, as well as videos and other media content. Reddit Platform for posting links, text messages, videos and images . These are then voted up or down and discussed by other members. Twitter Platform for posting, interacting with and sharing short messages (tweets) of maximum 280 characters, video and/or links. Weibo Platform for posting, interacting with and sharing short messages (Chinese equivalent of Twitter). YouTube Platform for postin g, interacting with and sharing videos and blog posts. Figure 3 shows the number of articles identified by year and by type of social media (excluding the two 2019 articles). It indicates that the large increase in the number of articles from 2015 was mostly attributed to an increase in studies conducted on Twitter (n=37, 54% of all articles published between 2015 and 2018), and to a smaller extent Facebook (n=10, 15%). Articles about less commonly studied types of social media (Pinterest, Weibo, Reddit, a nd Yahoo! Answers) were all published after 2015. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 15 Figure 3 . Number of articles published by type of social media and by year until 2018 Note: Forum refers to the different forums included in the articles covered by this report: babytree (China), Iltalehti and KaksPlus (Finland), Mothering.com (UK), and Mumsnet (UK) Type of vaccine monitored Most of the articles identified in this review looked at vaccines in (Figure 4). Additionally, five studies monitored social media in relation to the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic [30,76,114,120,128] and four studies looked at seasonal influenz a [67,71,124,134] . Other vaccines monitored on social media included polio looked both at polio and HPV vaccination [53]. Figure 4 . Number of articles published by type of vaccine Countries monitored A large proportion of studies did not restrict monitoring to one specific country and therefore contained global results (n=41) [52-57,59,62 -65,67,70 -75,77,78,80,81,84,86,9 0,92-95,97,99- 105,110,125,126] (Figure 5). However, some of these studies have restricted their search to specific languages such as English or Spanish, which may therefore provide skewed results towards particular regions of the world. Fifteen studies were conducted specifically with data coming from the United States (US) [30,45,58,61,66,68,83,85,87,88,91,96,107,129,130] , seven from Italy [32,60,89,98,106,118,133] , three from the Netherlands [69,131,134] and three from the United Kingdom (UK) [76,116,122] . Other countries specifically monitored included Romania (n=1) [117]. Four studies looked at data from multiple countries, including Australia, the US, Canada, and the UK [82,111,121,132] . 051015202530 2006 2007 2008 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018NUMBER OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED YEARForum Youtube scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 16 Figure 5 . Number of articles published by country monitored Ethics approval - public v ersus private data The issue of posts not being publically available was raised in nine studies, either as a pre -defined exclusion criterion or as a limitation [45,53,69,80,87,108,111,121,133] . This could be linked to certain ethical issues. Out of the 86 articles on socia l media monitoring, only 13 (15%) explicitly mentioned having received approval from an institutional ethics review board in Australia, Canada, Israel, Romania, the UK and the US [45,58,62- 64,76,82,92,105,108,109,113,117] . Additionally, one study did not mention whe ther they had received ethics approval, but stated ' guidelines from the Institutional Review Board have been considered and applied to protect the identity of forum users' [115] . Nine studies also specifically stated that they were exempt from institutional/ethical review as their studies did not directly involve human subjects or because social media analysis only included publically available data [56,57,70,74,86,94,95,99,104] . The authors of a study that obtained ethical approval, conducted on Facebook in Israel, further explained that as they anonymised their data, participant consent was not required as conversations on the Internet happen in public fora , where ' subjects would expect to be observed by strangers' [108] . However, anonymi sation was not enough for the authors of a global study conducted on Twitter, who were keen for other solutions to be found . They explain ed that private data c ould easily be revealed 'through the integrative analysis of multiple datasets ' and that revealing the identity of social network contributors who may have wishe d for it to be kept secret was feasible (the study did not mention seeking ethical approval) [80]. Finally, Tangherlini et al, who analysed comments on forums in the US and Canada (but did not mention seeking ethi cal approval) raised the growing challenge of accessing data on social media, as corporations are constantly reducing access to data [121] . scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 17 5.2.2 Data extraction Data extraction t ools In order to collec t data from social media on the subject of vaccination, the studies in this review used: Manual browser searches on web browsers such as Firefox, and Google Chrome. Browser searches are performed from within social media platforms - e.g. the basic or adva nced search bar usually found at the top of the page on Twitter, YouTube or Facebook . Social media APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). The term ' API' refers to a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. When Twitter is used, the Twitter application connects to the Internet and sends data (e.g. the text or images posted with a tweet) to a server . The server then retrieves th e data, interprets it , performs the necessary actions and sends it back to the Twitter application on a user's phone, web browser or a researcher's database, which is then interpreted and shown to the user in a readable format . APIs work across all social media platforms to pull and interpret data from servers storing in formation for Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit and many more. Automatic monitoring (commercial software). These can be automated web platforms that are free, open source (open to development from other developers), or commercial (where access is allowed via a subscription pricing structure); Use of both manual searches and APIs. Use of both automatic software and APIs. Figure 6 shows the number of software tools used within each category. Figure 6 . Number of studies by type of so cial media monitoring tools used Notes to the figure: API - Social media Application Programming Interfaces Manual - Manual browser searches on web browsers Automatic or commercial tool - Automated web platforms . Manual browser searches A total of 3 6 studies used web -based manual tools. Studies that used manual browser search functions within social media platforms tended to collect less data than those accessing the automatic Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or software. Some of the limitations of manual browser searches are described in Table 4. 35202461 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 NUMBER OF ARTICLES PUBLISHEDAPI and Manual API and Automatic API Automatic or commercial tool ManualKey messages Studies that used manual browser search functions within social media platforms tended to collect less data than those accessing the automatic Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or other software. A large number of studies used the Twitter API to co llect data due to the ease of access given by the Twitter platform to its data stream compared to other platforms. Studies used a range of commercial software, with the majority accessing paid -for periodical and historical Twitter data. Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 18 Table 4. Different manual browser searches and their limitations mentioned by the studies using the tool Social media tool Limitations YouTube search browser [32,93 -103] Despite the use of a variety of search terms being seen as a strength of the study, only the top 50 hits according to relevance were chosen to be analysed (this is in the context of the three million videos posted on the topic of vaccines currently on YouTube at the time of the project) [96] Facebook search tool [45,104,105,108,109,112,113] Due to the time intensity that assessing each Facebook site required, it was impractical to analyse each site in detail. Another limitation mentioned was that the focus of the assessment was on the most recent posts. The nature of posts on Facebook sites may change as new information regarding vaccines reaches the general public, such as during flu season or when school starts, and parents must turn in their child's vaccination records. During the short time for the data collection, there was no major news related to vaccines that had recently been reaching the general public. Finally, the authors did not gather data regarding individual users and cannot determine whe ther activity on the site centred on several engaged users or was spread among site membership [104] A small limitation to using a Hypertext PreProcessor (PHP) script supplied by Facebook as an add -on to the basic Facebook search tool as the script served to only collect each post's first 25 comments - this me ant that not all comments for every post were analysed. However, it was not considered a strong limitation since each post or comment was analysed as an individual unit. From the sampling frame, a sample of 2 289 items were randomly selected using a 'rando mise numbers' command. This was considered a representative sample of the initial sampling frame. This study was made before the data protection ethics and protocols linked to the 2018 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules came into place [135] , although all the data were anonymised and available for scientific use, the authors acknowledged that this methodology may give ris e to ethical concerns, given that identifiable comments made by people on public Facebook pages are scrutinised. Nevertheless, at the time of the study (2016), according to the Codes of Ethics and Conduct of Internet Research [136] , if an observation of public behaviour takes place in public fora where subjects would expect to be observed by strangers (such as a n open Facebook discussion), explicit individual consent is not required. If this search was made today, however, the analysis of potential identifiable user posts on Facebook would be limited [109] . Luisi (2018) [45], found that the Facebook search feature does not al low users to organise results by date or engagement (e.g. likes/comments). This limits flexibility in data collection. Technology also limited the ability to archive Facebook posts. When loading the search results, one would have to scroll down to make the area printable. Scrolling down too far would cause internet browsers to crash. Moreover , this study only collected public Facebook content in an effort to only analyse content that would be available to any Facebook user, because access to private social media feeds is not possible without specific participant consent. Suragh et al. (2018) [112] , found that a limitation of just using the Facebook browser search tool was the inability to examine entire social networks, which means that the fraction represented by the study data of what actually exists is unknown. The study was also limited to the information included in the online reports, with potential biases and errors in reporting. Lastly, there was the challenge of conducting searches in different countries. The findings from the Google and Facebook searches were dependent upon the geograph ic location of the reviewer and this reflected on targeting 'popular ' findings according to the search location and specific algorithms used by these companies. This limitation could have also been a result of the study methodology, which only included reports found in the first three pages for Google and top 20 posts for Facebook. It is possible that if larger search samples (Google produced hundreds of thousands of URL (Uniform Resource Locator) links per search term) were analysed, both reviewers would have found exactly the same results. Facebook results were dependent o n the date and time of the search (e.g. the highest placed posts found on one day were not the same as those found the next day) therefore searches had to be completed in one sitting and some of the URL links identified in Facebook did not work. The study used standardised search terms but other reports of cluster immunisation may probably have been found by including additional search terms and expanding to different languages, countries and regions. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 19 Social media tool Limitations Forum search tools [116] . In one study by Skea (2006) [116] relatin g to internet forum discussion on the measles - mumps -rubella (MMR) vaccine, one limitation found was that the 617 messages analysed were those posted to only one website, which meant that participants were probably not demographically representative of the wider population. In addition , a higher proportion of participants in the for a had refused MMR vaccine than in the general population. All these factors raised legitimate questions whether it is appropriate to generalise from the study's findings to the wider parent population, and whether and how insights from this study should inform future communications on MMR vaccine or vaccination more generally. Pinterest search tool [125] A study by Guidry et al. (2015) found that a limitation of using the m anual browser search was that Pinterest does not list its pins chronologically and does not list an exact time stamp for each pin. The authors found that this made using a more conventional content analysis sampling method , such as a constructed two- week t ime period , virtually impossible. In addition to the various web-based manual tools mentioned in the table above, three other studies used the Google Search too l[117,118,128] , three used a combination of the Twitter and Facebook search tools [113,130,133] , two studies used manual HTML (Hyper Text Markup) extraction [121,122] , one study used the Yahoo! Answers search engine [123] , and one study used the basic Twitter search tool [86]. Social media APIs Thirty -one studies sampled their data directly from their target social media platform's API. There was a strong focus on the Twitter API, which pushes focus on Twitter and neglects data on other social media platforms. The results of the scoping review found that Twitter does not provide a full reflection of all social media discussion, or indeed general discussion of vaccines overall. There is a need for a broader understanding of discussion s on other platforms, and how they may influence vaccine uptake. Some of the limitations of social media APIs are described below . Table 5 . Social media APIs and their l imitations mentioned by the studies using the tool Social media APIs Limitations Twitter API [30,54,57,59,61,63 - 67,69,71,74,80,82- 84,91,92] One study [69] used a combination of two Twitter APIs. This was because they found that general Streaming Twitter API did not provide an easy way to retrieve complete conversations (many of which were partially truncated/cut -off, due to some accounts being protected/private). Multiple replies to the same tweet can also occur, which the study's data retrieval method may not have detected. To retrieve a more complete sample of conversations on Twitter they used a combination of checking for replies to tweets within their user group and screen scraping from the Twitter browser page itself. It was found that data collected through the relevant keywords and accessed via the basic API stream acc ounted for only a quarter of the total number of results. This is, in itself, a highly interesting result: a search using keywords would miss 75% of the relevant tweets. One possible way to avoid t his would be to gain access to the Twitter Firehose or all tweets via a subscription -based and automated service - however, this may be cost -prohibitive to some studies. In one study[83] , one of the limitations of using the Twitter API was determined by looking at the scope of open debate on social med ia analysis, and whether social media discussions are a valid and accurate proxy for the rationales of the population at large. This applies both in terms of users' demographics and the potential for fake users (or automated bots) to spam social networks or post fake and polarising content. There was also a need to be aware of the (limited, but needed) amount of technical supervision required when analysing the sentiment and geolocation of tweets - the system requires computational capacity and server admin istration, as well as the creation of machine learning classifiers to annotate large amounts of social media data (i.e. tweets, images, posts, or comments) . Facebook API [106,107,110] In one stud y[111] , one of the limitations acknowledged was that the research conducted was limited by the combined public/private nature of Facebook. While p ublic Facebook pages do provide a wealth of network information, the authors were unable to gather information about how information shared from anti- vaccination pages disseminates through private Facebook pages or personal social media networks. Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 20 Automa tic monitoring or commercial software Twenty -six studies used automatic, commercial software to monitor social media with the majority accessing paid- for periodical and historical Twitter data (see Appendix 8.4 for a list and details of the automated tools and commercial software used in the studies in this review). Automatic monitoring or commercial software extract large amounts of data at one time . Costs can be high and there is a need for sufficient human resources to analyse the data captured. Period o f monitoring All studies sampled data from different social media platforms over varying periods of time . Below is a summary of the different ty pes of timed data collection in relation to the monitoring tools used and the amount of data collected. Single point in time Nine studies sampled data over a single point in time. It was found that these specific studies used a manual form of data collecti on. Three studies used the YouTube browser search tool [95,102,137] . Three studies used the search tools within forums that the y drew data from [114,115,119] . Two studies used the basic Facebook search function [104,105] . One study sampled data using the Pinterest browser search tool [125] . Continuous period of time Seventy -five studies were carried ou t over a continuous period of time. Months Thirty studies were conducted over a period of 1 20 months [30,52,62- 65,68,69,73,74,76,78- 80,85,88- 90,93,107- 109,113,120,123,127,128,131,132,134] . The studies were performed using a combination of API and automatic searches. Years Thirty -five studies were carried out within a one year and 16 -year time -span [32,53- 57,59,61,66,67,71,75,77,82- 84,86,87,91,96,98,99,106,110,111,116- 118,122,124,126,129,130,133] . The longest period of data collection was by a study that covered 237 112 Italian Facebook posts i n Facebook groups during a 16-year period, with the aim of understanding the linguistic and psychological features of the language used to talk about vaccinations on social media [106] . Overall, studies that were conducted over a period of years were done with a combination of API and automatic searches. Two more studies with large datasets retrieved 6 288,653 vaccine images on Twitter directly from the Twitter API over one year and eight months [59], and 1 448 010 tweets and data over seven years via the Twitter API [55]. Two studies collected data covering a period of ten years, using Facebook [45] and YouTube [98]. In the first study, 6 537 posts were collected using the Facebook browser search tool, with the aim of studying likes and parent/guardian perceptions, as well as social medi a representations of the HPV vaccine [45] . In the second study, the YouT ube browser search tool was used to sample 560 Italian videos over a period of ten years, with the aim of analysing any connections with discussions o n the reputed vaccine/autism link or links between vaccines and other serious medical conditions in childr en [98]. The largest collection of posts from a mixed study, using an automatic tool, was a study on Crimson Hexagon looking at a mixture of 58 078 Facebook posts and 82 993 tweets - to examine Facebook and Twitter discussions of vaccination in relation to measles during a period of several widely publicised outbreaks over a 7.5 year period [129] . Key messages The aim and resources available dictate the time period chosen for monitoring, whether in retrospect at a single point in time or over a continuous period. Regardless of the data collection period, studies with the highest number of results consistently came from the use of social media APIs or automatic data sampling. Yahoo! Answers API provided the largest sample size from a single platform over a sampling period of five years (16 million messages). Crimson Hexagon was the automatic platform that provided the largest mixed sample size, with a mixture of 58 078 Facebook post s and 82 993 tweets. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 21 Search strategies List of keywords used for social media monitoring Seventy -one articles provided a list of keywords used to mon itor social media (see Annex 8.5 for the full list). From these 71, only 10 specifically mentioned an extensive search strategy, with Boolean operators to link keywords (e.g. and, or) or truncations to identify words with different endings (e.g. vaccin*) [52,54,68,69,76,77,91,126,129,132] . Many studies only used a small number of keywords to monitor social media: 13 studies used only one keyword (e.g. vaccination, measles, MMR) [32,57,62,73,81,85,103,104,116,120,124,127,131] , eight studies used two keywords (e.g. HPV and vaccination, vaccination and immunisation) [56,69,70,86,94,95,101,115] and five studies used three keywords (e.g. vaccine, vaccines or vaccination) [54,93,110,118,132] . Studies looking specifically for negative content in relation to vaccination included keywords related to safety or risk, specific side effects, or certain conspiracy theories or celebrities. Most of the 71 studies were conducted on Twitter (n=10), YouTube (n=6) and forums (n=4). Three of these studies mentioned the small number of keywords as a limitation [32,56,96] . Most keywords can be classified as: words related to vaccines or vaccination (including the generic names and brand names of specific vaccines) vaccine -preventable diseases types of side effects anti-vaccination related keywords references to certain controversies and names. The keywords most commonly used across all studies are shown in Figure 7 . Figure 7 . Keywords most commonly used across all studies (>4 use) Use of hashtags Ten studies also included hashtags in their keywords when searching Twitter [55,56,60,70,74,75,81,86,87,129] . While some of these studies used generic vaccination keywords (#hpv, #vaccine, #vaccination), others searched for more specific hashtags social media discussions (#cdcwhistleblower, #b1less, #hearus, #iovaccino, #vaccineswork). One study, con ducted in the United States, explained that those specific hashtags were chosen because they were use d by journalists in articles covering anti -vaccination beliefs on Twitter [87]. Use of questions While some studies used simple keywords or hashtags to conduct searches, others used questions. For example, a study conduc ted on YouTube concerning HPV used the keywords 'should I get the HPV vaccine ' or 'what can go wrong with the HPV vaccine ' [99]. These keywords were selected based on a modified Delphi procedure, where investigators asked for and reviewed terms provided by non -medical and medical colleagues as well as patient representatives and practitioners. One of the two studies conducted on Yahoo! Answers typed in questions such as 'what is papillomavirus ' and 'what is the effectiveness and safety of HPV vaccines ' to collect results [123]. 31 2221 161514131110876 5 5 5 5 5 5 5Key messages Social media monitoring studies often u sed a small number of keywords related to vaccination and/or vaccine -preventable diseases. Studies looking specifically for negative content around vaccination included keywords related to safety or risk, specific side effects, or certain conspiracy theories or celebrities. Questions, phrases and/or h ashtags (e.g. #vaccine) were used in different search es. The use of three categories of keywords - relevant, semi -relevant and non -relevant - was found to increase precision in a search. Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 22 Use of phrases A search on Facebook looked for various phrases about mass psychogenic illnesses related to vaccination, including 'mass hysteria after vaccine ' and 'fainting in school children after vaccine ' [112] . These terms were developed after consultations with safety experts at WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and then pilot tested. Exclude data Two studies also used keywords to exclude data. A study conducted on Twitter in the US used words such as 'malware, caffeine, heroin and needle exchange ' to exclude irrelevant results [68]. A Dutch study, als o conducted on Twitter, used words such as ' blood tests or travel vaccinations' [69]. Use of languages Twenty -four studies specified using English keywords or excluding results not published in English [30,45,52,56,64,65,70,71,74,82,84- 86,90,93- 96,99,101,104,110,112,128] . Seven of those discussed th e decision as a limitation in their discussion [56,71,86,90,99,112,128] . Fifteen studies used keywords in languages other than English: six studies used Italian keywords [32,60,89,98,118,133] , five used Spanish keywords [79,97,100,102,123] , two used Dutch keywords [69,131] , one used Chinese keywords [115] , and one used keywords in Hebrew [108] . Another seven studies focused on social media posts in other languages, without necessarily using keywords in other languages. Four studies, conducted in Italy [106] , Israel [109] , Canada [113] and Spain [114] did not provide the keywords but directly extrac ted data from Facebook groups in Italian, Hebrew and Canadian French/English, and from YouTube videos in Spanish or Catalan. A Romanian study analysing online forums did not specify the language of the keywords used, but explained that only Romanian discus sion forums were included [117] . Another study used keywords in English but also included in their analysis tweets identified in other languages [67]. Finally, one study developed a keyword strategy ( 'pentavalent OR pentavac OR quinvaxem ') with the purpose of retrieving messages from multiple national discussions [54]. However, the authors acknowledged that their search terms did not include all brand names, which could have limited re sults from a number of countries. Evaluation of keywords Only two studies evaluated their keywords: one conducted on Twitter in the Netherlands [69], and the other on Twitter and Reddit in Canada, the UK and the US [132] . The Dutch study used three lists of keywords (in Dutch): relevant (HPV AND vaccination), semi -relevant (HPV OR vaccination), and non -relevant keywords (words related to other ty pes of injections an d other meanings of the search keywords). These keywords were generated manually by the authors a nd by using a quick scan of initial search results. They found that using such a system allows good precision. Semi - relevant keywords were particularly useful, as 66% of tweets by users from the target group were found to be relevant. On average, 59% of tweets occurring before and later in the conversations were relevant [69]. The study conducted on Twitter and Reddit used two sets of keywords: one for vaccines (vaccine OR vaccines or MMR) and the other one to look for discussi ons around the vaccine -autism link ((vaccine OR vaccines OR MMR) and autism). The average precision and recall estimate s were 95% and 92% , respectively [132] . However, t he authors mentioned that their keywords might not have sufficiently considered differences in cultures and norms. Visualisation of data The most commonly used form of data visualisation was created with Microsoft Office Software (e.g. Excel or Word), with the table being the most frequently used f ormat ; 75 studies used this format to represent were used to visualise data . The most commonly used form of data visualisation was created with Microsoft Office Software (e.g. Excel or Word), with the table being the most frequently used format . Visualisation of social media monitoring results is a developing field. There is a great deal of variation in interpreting and presenting the results in order to communicate clearly and to have an impact on policy. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 23 Other visual representations of data identified were: bar charts (32 studies) [30,45,53,54,57,59,60,66,67,75- 77,79,84,88- (27 calculus diagrams ( six studies) [30,60,89,91,121,126] pie charts ( area charts ( two studies) [60,126] dendrograms (diagrams representing a tree) (two [84,126] proportional ( one study) [54] treemap ( whisker graph ( one study) [66] box graph ( study) [66]. Six studies used screensho ts to visualise their findings [45,73,78,111,113,125] . Two were screenshots from the basic Facebook search browser [45,113] . One was from the automated Top sy tool [73], one was from Facebook data taken from the automated Social -Media Lab [111] , while one was from the automated VaccineWatch software [78]. One study used screenshots from Pinterest [125] and one study used a story gram (creation software unknown) [121] . Thirteen studies used social network charts [52,62,68,76,81,82,84,85,88,110,111,121,126] - these were created using the Gephi software package [138] . Visualisation of social media monitoring results is a developing fie ld. There is a great deal of variation in the interpret ation and present ation of the results in order to communicate clearly and have an impact on policy. 5.2.3 Data analysis Once extracted the data were analysed in different ways (see Appendix 8.3 for more information on each of the studies aims) . This included : calculating the number of posts available over a period of time; detailed content analysis to identify the frequency of particular concerns or conspiracies relating to vaccination ; qualitative t hematic analysis ; language and discourse analysis; comparing social media posts to disease incidence or outbreak cases. The most common type of analysis looked at sentiments expressed towards vaccination (70% of studies, 60/86). Geo-localisation Manually extracting location information Some studies collected meta -data on location information (if available) or by manually screening for locations within posts [65,82,132] . McNeil et al . filtered their data using location -specific search terms (United Kingdom, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, etc.) to screen Twitter users' profile pages [76] . Manual methods do not always provide enough information, as Dunn et al. explain in their study: ' accurate location information can be found in only a small proportion of tweets that have coordinates stored in the metadata of the tweet (geo -tags)', which corresponds to only 1% of twee ts [66]. Automated mechanisms to retrieve location information All the studies that used automated mechanism s to retrieve location information were conducted on Twitter and were either global studies [53,54,67,80] or studies focusing on the US [66,87,91] . Four of these studies used various types of software (Carmen, Geodict, Nominatim, GeoSocial Gauge) to extract l ocation information from tweets or user profile pages but did not provide detailed information about the software [66,67,80,91] . Key messages Only a small number of studies extracted and analysed location data from social media. Country -specific social media monitoring was difficult due to the very small proportion of tweets, posts, videos or profile pages with geo -location tags enabled or with public information on location. Dictionary of terms for geographical entities may be used to automatically identify mentions of countries or cities . Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 24 In their study, Bahk et al. described the ' Vaccine Sentimeter ', a tool that facilitates media monitoring for vaccination. Their tool allows results to be filtered by location and to display articles geogra phically. Posts are automatically tagged for location (if available) using HealthMap technology, followed by human curation to validate and correct the automated tags [53]. Becker et al. used a dictionary of terms for geographical entities of count ries, GeoNames, to automatically identify mentions of countries (or cities) in tweets. For countries and cities with the same names (e.g. Bali is both a city in India and an island in Indonesia), the result with the largest population was selected, which m ay have led to some misallocations. However, t he authors explain that this mechanism does not distinguish between country mentions that are related to the vaccines being discussed and those that are not [54]. Tomeny et al. used a tool to define geographical entities [87]. As their study was focused on the US, they used the Office of Management and Budget's Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical areas. The tool categorises areas into metro (>50 000) and micro areas and a list of counties. Tweets were geo -located based on these entities by using the Twitter Global Positioning Syst ems (GPS) coordinates (if available) or the user's self -disclosed location in their profile page. While only 1% of tweets identified had GPS coordinates, 63% provided self -disclosed locations on users' profiles. The authors then used the Census Reporter's API to resolve city names to the correct micro or metro areas. An external validity check was also performed by manually locating 560 random user profiles and found that 531 profiles (95%) of locations had been correctly identified [87]. Trends, content and sentiment Categories of sentiments used and definitions Sixty studies (70%) provided some type of sentiment coding and analysis, two of which did not specify the categories used to code sentiments [119,120] (Figure 8). Key messages The sentiments most commonly used by researchers to categorise content relating to vaccination in social media were ' neutral ', 'negative' , and ' positive '. Only a small number of studies used more complex sentiments (e.g. sarcasm, humour or hesitancy). Manual sentiment analysis : The majority of studies manually coded sentiments based on a thematic analysis. Limitations of manual sentiment analysis : time -consuming, requires 2 -4 trained coders and codebooks, highly subjective, difficult to code sarcasm, slang or hyperbole. Advanta ges of manual sentiment analysis : no computational skills needed, easy to conduct . Automated sentiment analysis: The studies using automated systems were mostly conducted on Twitter. They used machine learning, based on a sample of manually -coded data. Lightside was identified as an accurate and valid algorithm to code sentiments. Other non -evaluated algorithms included Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Na\u00efve Bayes, Brightview Classifier and Topsy. Limitations of automated sentiment analysis : prone to bias as relying on manual coding to train algorithms requires strong computational skills, and it is difficult to code sarcasm or irony . Advantages of automated sentiment analysis: more accurate and less time -intensive than manual coding. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 25 Figure 8 . Sentiment codes used across all studies With the exception of a few studies that only searched for negative or anti -vaccination sentiments [61,65,92] , studies generally used a set of codes to characterise different types of sentiments in their data. The most co mmonly used set of sentiments across all studies was ' positive, negative or neutral ', or similar (e.g. positive or negative). Thirty -two studies used these exact three sentiments to classify their data, 21 manually coding the data [32,45,54,58,68,69,72,73,79,86,93,96,98- 102,112,113,116,127] , and 10 using automated coding [30,53,63,64,66,74,75,83,89,106] . One study also used a combination of manual and automated coding, using a sentiment score for the automated coding (from 0 -100)[70]. The other most commonly used types of sentiments were ' pro-vaccine, anti -vaccine, neutral ', which were used in 20 studies. Other combinations of these sentiments included ' pro-vaccination and anti -vaccination ', or simply ' pro and anti '. Thirteen of these studies used manual coding [52,56,57,61,69,90,103- 105,110,114,125,133] and seven automated coding [62,77,87,88,91,92,129] . Some studies used different types of sentiment categorisations. Two studies conducted on YouTube used the words ' encouraging, discouraging or neutral ' [94,95] . Two studies, one on YouTube [97] and one on Twitter [60] used the terms for/in favour of vaccination, against/not in favour of vaccination, or neutral. A study conducted on Reddit used the terms affirmative and negative [126] . Huang et al., used the question 'does this message indicate that someone received or intended to receive a flu vaccine? ' (yes/no) to code sentiments on Twitter using an automated system [67]. Only two studies used a more comprehensive and thorough list of sentiments, including humour/sarcasm, concern, relief, and minimised risk. One of these was conduc ted in Dutch on Twitter, Facebook and for a [131] and the other was conducted on Twitter in Spain [79]. One study, used WHO's SAGE determinants of vaccine hesitancy framework to design a list of initial codes and sentiments that was then reviewed after testing it on a few posts [113] . Two studies coded sentiments as binary variables (positive vs. negative), while another two studies combined positive and neutral sentiments in the analysis [54,127] . One study conducted on Twitter explained that 0.1% of the 1 154 156 tweets identified were coded (1 151), by selecting the first tweet with a random number ge nerator and then coding every 1000th tweet [62]. In summary, t he codes most commonly used to characterise sentiments were neutral (n=37), negative (n=33), positive (n=31), anti -vaccine or (n=20) . Twenty -six studies (43%) provided definitions of the different codes used for the sentiment analysis (Table 6). 37 33 31 20 20 6 3 22 1 1 111 1 11 1 11 1Neutral, no opinion Negative Positive Pro-vaccination, pro-vaccine Anti-vaccination, anti-vaccine Ambiguous, unclear Hesitant, doubt Discouraging Encouraging Anger Anxiety Concern Humor/sarcasm Minimised risk Personal experiences Question Relief Sceptical Affirmative Received or intended to receive flu vaccine? FrustrationSystematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 26 Table 6 . List of codes, definitions and counts for sentiment analysis used in the identified studies Category Definition Negative Negative sentiments, attitudes or arguments against vaccination [32,65,68,74,91,99 - 101,113,125,127] Concerns about safety, efficacy, cost, resistance due to cultural or emotional issues, progra mme suspension or other types of concerns [54,63,65,96,99,112,113] Posts that would lead readers to be less inclined toward vaccination [53] Source of the post judged unreliable [116] .

TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 27 Four studies used the Health Belief Model to facilitate content analysis, whether qualitative or quantitative [45,82,96,125] . Five studies described a qualitative thematic analysis of the content of social media, with an inductive or deductive identification of codes and themes [71,108,109,119,134] . An additional seven studies focused their qualitative analysis on language and discourse anal ysis [76,78,107,115- 117,130] . Twenty -one studies co ded the content in a quantitative manner, with a pre- defined codebook used to ascertain the absence or presence of themes in the data [45,52,56,72- 74,79,85,86,93- 96,99 - 101,103,106,113,118,125] . Four studies used supervised machine learning to code content on social media, including: analysis of image sharing; measuring proportion of vaccine concerns; text -based analysis by comparing percentage of words within different categories; and developing a method for story aggregation [59,82,105,121] . Four studies compared social media posts to disease incidence or outbreaks [66,124,129,131] . One study analysed content differences between ' human' tweets and those coming from bots [57] . Methods used for coding and analysing sentiments From the 60 studies that coded sentiments in social media, 40 (67%) used a manual coding system and 19 (32%) used an automated system. One study used both a manual and automated system [54]. Almost all of the studies that used an automated system were conducted on Twitter (n=16, 84%). Studies where sentiments were coded manually most commonly analysed Twitter (n=14, 35%) as well as and for 9) . Figure 9 . Number of studies using manual or automated sentiment coding, by social media Manual sentiment coding Many studies explained that manual coding was conducted based on a thematic or content analysis of sentiments [32,45,56- 58,72,73,79,86,96,113,116,131,133] . Reviewers were provided with training, definitions of codes, and codebooks to code the data . While most articles simply coded the social media posts (tweets on Twitter, pages/posts on Facebook, videos on YouTube, etc.), a small number of articl es coded specific parts of the data: YouTube: in addition to coding videos on YouTube, two studies also coded comments related to those videos [93,98] . Facebook: while one study mentioned focusing on comments related t o a specific post [105] , another study looked for s entiments on pages, groups and places [104] , and anothe r one obtained sentiments from main objectives of the pages or groups, the title, content of the introductory description, and messages posted by the group creator [133] . Twitter: Three articles also discussed how they coded sentiments on Twitter: one looked at the title, headline and source or domain of tweets [68], another one used the verbs, adverbs and adjectives within Tweets [72] and the last one used both Inlink sites and Twitter profile pages [90]. Three studies also coded the sentiments of hashtags used on Twitter, for example coding #vaccineswork as positive and #killingusslowly, #cdcfraud or #vaxxedthemovie as negative [52,61,86] . One study also explained coding the hashtag #antivaxxers as positive and #provaxxers as negative, to reflect the fact that social media users against vaccination do not usually talk about themselves as antivaxxers or vice-versa [52]. Pinterest: the only study conducted on Pinterest coded sentiments from images, captions and links [125] . 1 1 02461214 0 0 1 1 0 1 016 024681012141618 Pinterest Weibo Reddit Mix Forums Facebook YouTube TwitterNUMBER OF ARTICLES PUBLISHEDManual AutomatedSystematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 28 Reviewers to code the data Fourteen studies used two reviewers to independently code the data [45,56,62,69,70,73,79,96,97,99,104,110,125,131] , with one study specifying that the two reviewers were blinded to the research quest ion [96]. Ten studies used three reviewers to code the data [32,72,86,101,105,112,113,127] [68,102] , with one study mentioning that the third reviewer was unaware of the study hypothesis [105] . In some of studies that used two or three reviewers, the second or third reviewer sometimes just analysed a small sample of the dataset to establish the reliability of the coding fram e. Some studies explained disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus instead [45,57,69,104,105, 113,131] . One study used four reviewers (with the fourth one consulted only for discrepancies) [57]. One PhD dissertation used only one reviewer [116] . Fourteen studies did not specify how many reviewers manually coded the data. Interrater reliability of the coding Twenty -three of the 40 articles that manually coded sentiments in social media tested interrater reliability to identify the extent to which the codes correctly represented the sentiments measured. Twelve studies used Cohen's Kappa score to test interrater reliability, and obtained resulted between 0.31 - 1.0 [56,62,69,73,79,93,94,102,105,110,127,131] . Two studies used Krippendorff's alpha and obtained scores of 0.65 and 0.67 [45,96] . One study used Scott's Pi, and obtained a measure of 0.84 [125] . Eight studies did not specify which methods were used to calculate i nterrater reliability, but stated researchers reached 80 100% agreement on coding [32,68,70,95,97,99,101,113] . Limitations of manual sentiment coding Studies that used manual coding of sen timent described limitations such as the analysis resulting from a subjective coding and the difficulties of manually ascribing sentiments to posts or tweets [69,93,131] . The difficulty of coding sarcasm, slang and hyperboles was also discussed [52,58,68] . Manual coding was also described a s labour intensive, which could reduce the number of posts analysed [56]. Automated sentiment coding Fifteen studies, all of them conducted on Twitter, discussed the use of leverage or supervised machine learning to code sentiments in their datasets [53,60,63- 65,67,74,75,77,83,88,89,91,92,106] . Five studies described how they trained the machine to learn how to code different sentiments, by first manually coding a range of tweets (between 693 and 8 261 tweets) [65,74,75,89,92] . Four other studies used Amazon Mechanical Turk to train the machine in sentiment coding [67,77,83,91] . In one study, in which Amazon Mechanical Turk was used to code a random sample of 10 000 tweets, the authors rejected coding from three annotators as their agreement was below 60% [67]. One study also manually coded tweets after the computer -assisted coding to refine the classification results and randomly selected tweets to validate model classifications after each round of coding [75]. Two studies used topic modelling to code Tweets and Reddit posts [83,126] . The studies used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an unsupervised machine -learning algorithm that automatically determines topics in a text. One o f the two studies explains that LDA ' assumes words in documents co -locate near other words (possibly across documents) because they are related, and the algorithm collects and reports groups of such related words, with the groups representing topics' [83]. One study conducted on Twitter evaluated three standard classification algorithms to automatically predict sentiments based on manually rated tweets: Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy and a Dynamic Language Model classifier [30]. In the end, the authors selected Naive Bayes f or their study, using the Natural Language Toolkit. One study conducted on Twitter used Lightside, an open -source platform that performs feature- extraction [87]. This study first trained the algorithm on 2 000 manually coded tweets, coded independently by two reviewers, before using Lightside to automatically code the r est of the tweets. The model was evaluated and judged as accurate and valid by the authors [87]. A study conducted on Facebook and Twitter used BrightView classifier, provided by Crimson Hexagon to code sentiments [129] . BrightView is a ' supervised learning algorit hm based on stacked regression analysis of simplified numerical representation of text ' [129] . To train the algorithm, some of the investigators manually coded a random sample of tweets and posts before and after the automated coding. Finally, one study used Topsy to analyse sentiments in tweets. Topsy was software (bought by Apple in 2015) that used natural language processing to establish a sentiment score ranging from 0 (negative) to 100 (positi ve) [70]. Limitations of automated sentiment coding Some studies discussed the limitations of automated machine learning systems for sentiment analysis of social media. Three studies discussed the difficulties for models to handle sarcasm and irony [60,89, 126] and one explained that slang and abbreviations may make it more difficult for machine learning sys tems to correctly identify sentiments [70]. This study also mentioned that when URL are shared in tweets they are not coded, however they include important contextual information that may help the sentiment analysis [70]. Three studies also mentioned that automated systems still rely on manual annotation of some part of the data to train the system, which is prone to biases [53,70,126] . TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 29 Reach analysis Forty-nine studies measured potential social media reach by examining i nteractions of diffe rent social network communities in order to understand how information can spread and be shared on social media. Twenty -five studies measured the conversational discourse and sentiment in comments to posts on vaccines [32,45,55,71,72,93,96,98- 100,103- 105,107- 113,117,120,121,125,126] . Five studies included the number of followers that posters had on different social media platforms, while two of these specifically looked a t how the number of followers a user had affected the amount of retweets, and tone of sentiment in relation to those retweets [30,65,82,86,92] . Nineteen studies mentioned the amount of retweets that key posts received [56,59,65,67,69- 71,73,74,76,79,80,82,84,87,88,129,131,132] , with seven of these studies analysing the effect of retweets on reach and influence in more detail [56,59,65,69,70,74,76,79,80,88,129,131] . The following is a brief overview of some of the studies that assessed the impact of followers and retweets on vaccine discussion across different types of social network communitie s, and the effect t his had on overall sentiment towards vacci nation . One study investigated how two types of communities interacted with each other within conversations on health and its relation to vaccines [88]. From a retweet network , of 660 892 tweets published by 269 623 users - the study compared ' structural community ' with another ' opinion group ' and used community detection algorithms and auto -tagging to measure the inter action, sentiment and influence that retweets had in conversations between the two communities. Another study focussed on shared concerns relating to the HPV vaccine [82] across different countries. One study looked at communication patterns revealed through retweeting [80] . They assessed the impact of various sources of information, contrasting diverse types of authoritative content (e.g. health organisations and o fficial news organisations) and grassroots campaign arguments (with the anti - vaccination community views serving as a prototypical example). One study analysed the content and source of the most popular tweets relating to the controversial death of a child in Spain - an unvaccinated child who contracted and later died from diphtheria [79]. Another study analysed both tweets and retweets together to compare the weekly number of online social media messages with the weekly number of reported measles cases in a Dutch measles outbreak [131] . One study looked at a combination of 83 551 tweets or retweets from 30 621 users [65]. The study defined social connections as the sets of users that followed, or were followed by the users that tweeted about HPV vaccines. One study specifically looked at the content of two vaccine- related Twitter datasets, with a focus on retweets and their frequency, and possible influence of retweet frequency on sentiment [56] . 5.3 Using social media monitoring to inform vaccination communication strategies Key messages Studies examined the i nteractions of different social network communities to try to understand how information can spread and be shared on social media and how it can impact overall sentiment towards vaccination. The m ajority of studies measured: the conversational discourse and sentiment in comments the number of followers that posters had on different social media platforms the amount of retweets that key posts received. Key messages Some studies recommended that health authorities, governments and/or healthcare professionals start monitoring social media to detect increases in online activity, shifts in sentiments, or other signals that may influence vaccination uptake or confidence in real time. Some studies also ackno wledged that social media monitoring could help health authorities anticipate, understand and respond to public questions and concerns. Results from the monitoring also led some studies to discuss the need for health authorities to increase their presence, and their popularity on social media. Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 30 None of the studies formally evaluated how social media monitoring methods and information gathered from monitoring can be used to inform communication strategies. However, some studies provided recommendations and suggestions as part of their discussions and data interpretation. Detect increases in online activity, shifts in sentiments, or other signals A first set of studies recommended that health authorities, governments and/or healthcare professionals start monitoring social media to detect increases in online activity, shifts in sentiments, or other signals that may have an influence on vaccination uptake or confidence in real time [53,64,75,87,88,112,118,128] . A specific recom mendation from Kang et al. is that social media monitoring should also incorporate a semantic network analysis of sentiments to improve understanding of the scope and the variability of public attitudes and beliefs [68]. Two studies recommended identifying the platforms people use to gather information on vaccines or those where misinformation or low -quality evidence is shared [56,66] . Seeman et al. also explained that social media monitoring is not only about identifying content and that health authorities should also measure engagement 2 to detect more popular content and better understand how it is shared [128] . Two studies explained that social media monitoring can be used to examine the effectiveness of vaccine promotion strategies and the impact of positive information on vaccination [64,88] . Another study also stressed the importance of flagging anti -vaccine websites [128] . One study also desc ribed social media monitoring as an importan t source of information for adverse- events following immunisation surveillance , particularly anxiety -related reactions [112] . Anticipate, understand and respond to public questions and concerns Some studies also acknowledged that social media monitoring could help health authorities anticipate, und erstand and respond to public questions and concerns [32,53,68,82,109,112,113,120,125,131] . Seven studies concluded that real -time informatio n about w hich topics or issues the public is discussing on social media would enable health authorities to develop tailored, targeted, cost -effective and responsive public engagement or communication strategies, for example by informing press releases and vaccinati on campaigns, or by directing responses to online content more effectively [53,66, 96,117,118,130,133] . More specifically, health authorities should seek inspiration from highly shared information to guide the development of improved messaging using visual designs, features and language formatting [128] . Two studies raised the possibility of producing spatio -temporal indicators from social media monitoring which could allow public health organisations to better target their health information campaigns to reach those who have concerns about vaccination, for example using an interactive map that would pro duce notifications when there is an increase in concern about vaccination in certain areas [84,87] . Two st udies also discussed the usefulness of social media monitoring during infectious disease outbreaks as it may allow health authorities to create adaptive messages during different stages of the crisis, respond to specific concerns on social media and provide rapid responses carefully planned in advance [85,120] . Finally Seeman et al. referred to the use of counter -marketing strategies, which they defined as a way to 'proactively identify and expos e misinformation and anecdotal evidence ' and engage 'in publicly viewable web discussions with authors of anti -vaccine postings' [128] . They argue this type of communication shows constructive and transparent engagement and provokes dialogue rather than shutting down dissent [128] . Increase presence, and popularity on social media Results from the social media monitoring studies also led some authors to discuss the need for health authorities to increase their presence, and their popularity on social media [32,66,90,94,106,109,125,127] , with one study discuss ing the ethical implications of non -engagement [113] . A few suggestions were made for health authorities wishing to increase their presence on social media and these ar e summarised in Table 7 . 2 Engagement of users in social media can be measured by analysing comments, shares, likes, retweets, mentions, clicks and saves. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 31 Table 7. Suggestions for increasing presence on social media identified in scoping review studies Messages Address issues related to vaccine hesitancy (safety of vaccines, effectiveness, benefits, etc.) as well as enhancing public trust in relevant scientific institutions in order to lower institutional distrust [68] Provide precise infor mation without too much detail [106] Use lay terms and appropriate language [112] Use more narrative styles of communication, discuss the protective effects of vaccines, describe the lives saved through vaccines [74,125] Share messages of empowerment [130] , be respectful [119] Communicate evidence -based information [112] Aim to enhance public understanding of science and the scientific methods and emphasise the importance of scientific informa tion [90,105] Immunise users against the critical arguments they are likely to encounter in the online platform they are entering [118] Share new research by sharing media articles rather than publications to engage the general public [74] Avoid using the name of brands in messaging which could lead to more negative reactions [75] Avoid downplaying negative sentiments, for example by saying side effects are minimal [75] . Use of emotions The use of emotions is controversial. While some authors advise that communication should be emotional and cognitive [94] and that it should elicit emotions such as anxiety, fear, regret and blame [117] , others recommend not to use anxiety or anger and avoid fear [106] . One study also explains that fear can be used if balanced properly but should be avoided w ith certain audiences [130] . Emotion -filled arenas call for new rhetorical strategies to complement logical arguments [120] Be careful with unclear, hostile, inaccurate messages from pro -vaccination so urces [105] Be non -judgemental and transparent [113] . Mechanisms Provide online dialogues including hosting real- time Q&A sessions [127] Create twitter chats [74] Adapt messages - deliver more persuasive messages on weekends instead of the middle of the week as negative opinions are more prevalent on these days [64] Ensure sufficient resources are available for regular communication [120] . Reach and engagement Enable public health in stitutions to become skilled influencers [32] Decide whether using individuals or organisations will have a higher impact [120] Use key opinion leaders on social media to disseminate messages which could reach users who would not normally follow the social media accounts of health agencies [56,75] Use hashtags, mentions and links to increase dissemination an d reach and to appear in searches and avoid echo -chamber effects where people only hear from their own circles [74,75] Non expert sources may be more important than expert sources when reaching parents in online for a [115] Prioritise parents with children aged two years and under , as they are highly motivated to participate in discussions, eager and responsive [115] Capitalise on awareness days to raise engagement and interest [74] If possible use consistent, lon g-term activity of communications, rather than only media or event - driven episodic messaging [124] . Responding to social media posts Correct misinformation on platforms (advocates and medical professionals) [58] [82,109,112,113] Develop systems to instantly detect anti -vaccine tweets and directly reply with counter messages [87] Answer questions using the same social media platform where t he question was asked [124] If faced with bots or trolls, emphasise that the credibility of the source is dubious and that users exposed to such con tent may be more likely to encounter malware [57] . In addition to th ese suggestions and tips, Nicholson et al. provided seven key recommendations as to how advocates of immunisation, such as vaccination programme managers , public health institutions, or healthcare professionals may engage in social media, particularly for a with a large group of fence -sitters seeking information [119] (see Box 1 below). Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 32 Box 1. Recommendations for health professionals and other advocates of immunisation on how to best participate in online discussion forums about immunisation [119] Resolve questions of whether to actively engage. There is often a dilemma about whether to respond to posts on forums, which are often monopolised by vocal opponents of immunisation. Here the concern is that participation in the discussion legitimises and even amplifies anti -vaccine arguments. The absence of vaccine advocates may create a void into which misinformation could reign uncontested. Prepare . Engage a group of vaccine advocates; agree on the most important messages; and who will advance them. Ensure sufficient numbers of designated experts and advocates who are able to type quickly and are available to respond for the duration of the discussion, or arrange 'shifts'. Diversify the support base . Ensure that each participating advocate is able to address various issues including vaccinology, disea se outcomes, primary care practice, and consumers and professionals who can identify with people experiencing specific outcomes, but who support immunisation. Set the agenda . Vaccine advocates should lead the discussion and avoid the traditionally defensiv e mode in which debates operate. Introduce messages known to positively influence behaviour . Promote messages that appeal to the core parental values of protecting children from diseases and facilitating the telling of stories around disease impact. M essages known to increase intention to immunise include emphasising potential regret of not vaccinating in a non- confrontational way; appealing to altruism in terms of protecting the vulnerable; and the ' band- wagon ' phenomenon where learning that others are vaccinating makes a parent more likely to want to do so. Social media's advantages include the capacity to role model positive health behaviour. Those who have immunised could be asked what factors influenced their decision, which allows wavering parents to see potential advantages of immunisation that they may not have considered. Do not oversell the product . It is important to acknowledge that vaccines can produce common minor side effects and rare but serious reactions. Promotional messages that also acknow ledge the side effects of immunisation paradoxically lead to lower risk perceptions. Giving information on what is known about vaccine risk defines the boundaries between fact and fiction and signals that the person conveying the information is knowledgeable and balanced, increasing their trustworthiness. Do not attack the opposition . Compassion and respect should underscore vaccine advocacy. Direct attacks of the opposition often result in vitriolic debates played out before ambivalent audiences who will often make their decisions via an assessment of source credibility. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 33 5.4 Uses, benefits and limitations of social media as an intervention tool in relation to vaccination A total of 17 articles describing social media as an intervention tool in relation to vaccination were identified in this review. The articles were divided into three categories of intervention, as described below . Interventions using social m edia as a source of information The use of online group discussions to engage the public The development of websites with an interactive component . Annex 8.6 provides an overview of the studies on social media as an intervention tool in relation to vaccination , including a short description of the intervention and outcomes/results. 5.4.1 Interventions using s ocial media as a source of information Ten articles, published between 2012 and 2019 , described how social media could be used to provide information about vaccination to the public, thereby aiming to address vaccine hesitancy [43,139- 147]. Of these, five interventions used Facebook, one used an online forum, one used YouTube and three used a mix of social media tools (Twitter, Facebook a nd Vine; Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and Facebook and Instagram). Most of the studies were conducted in the United States (n=4), with other studies conducted in Germany (n=2), Canada (n=2), Italy (n=1), and globally (n=1). Three interventions addressed vaccinatio n in general, five focused on HPV vaccina tion and two on influenza vaccination. Exposure to messages and video contests A qualitative study found that exposure to messages and video contests (participants submitted videos where they were asked to finish the sentence 'I received the HPV vaccine so that I have time to... ') about HPV vaccination on Facebook, Twitter, and Vine seem to increase uptake of HPV vaccination among some participants[147] . None of the quantitative studies assessing the impact of social media information in relation to vaccination , vaccination uptake or willingness to get vaccinated found a significant effect [144,145] . Impact of advertisements One study, looking at the impact of advertisements relating to HPV vaccination posted on Facebook (including cues f or action to motivate adolescents to seek vaccination), found that out of 155 110 adolescents reached and 2 106 engaged with the messages (e.g. liked or shared posts), only 152 had received at least one dose of HPV vaccine (significance not measured) [143] . Key messages Information on social media None of the quantitative stu dies found that providing information on social media regarding vaccination significantly increased uptake or willingness to get vaccinated, which may reflect the methodological challenges of establishing a causal link between vaccine behaviour and social media exposure. Information supporting vaccination on Facebook in the US was found to significantly decrease perceived barriers to HPV vaccination, decrease perceptions of risk, and increase knowledge about the HPV vaccine . The content matters: loss- framed messages on Facebook were associated with a significantly higher intention of getting vaccinated than gain -framed messages. Narratives containing information about vaccine adverse events corresponded to decreasing intention of getting vaccinated . Online group discussions A Facebook -assisted teaching method increased knowledge and intention of getting vaccinated . Parents and friends were found to have a strong influence on vaccination decision- making, whether they shared their views online or in person . When comparing factual information to personal experiences in for a, no difference was found in the number of responses to each type of post, but responses to personal experiences were more emotional . Interactive websites Interactive websites with a space for parents to contribute with content and discuss concerns were found to significantly reduce parental concerns around vaccination but no impact was found on vaccine -related attitudes or vaccine uptake. A survey in the US found that 50% of parents who accepted, delayed or refused vaccines would use interactive websites if available. Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 34 Differences between gain -framing (i.e. health benefits fr om getting the HPV vaccine) and loss -framing (i.e. negative consequences of not getting the HPV vaccine) messages [142] . One study found that participants exposed to a loss -framed message on Facebook had a significantly higher intention of getting vaccinated than those in the gain- framing condition (p<0.05). This same study also found that participants exposed to Facebook messages perceived lower barriers to getting vaccinated against HPV than those exposed to a newspaper message (p<0.05), but also perceived the severity of HPV to be lower (p<0.05). No significant effect was found on the perception of benefits of vaccination [142]. Impact of pro -vaccination or anti -vaccination comments on risk perception One study conducted in Germany on Facebook found that readers exposed to the post and comments supporting vaccination had a lower perception of r isk than readers exposed to comments opposing vaccination. The study also found that participants who read the post with likes had more positive attitudes towards influenza vaccination than those who read the version of the post without any likes [145] . Source credibility Another study cond ucted in Germany attempted to discern the impact of source credibility on resulting vaccination perception [140]. These researchers found that, irrespective of the source, narratives containing information about vaccine adverse events corresponded with decreased in tentions o f getting vaccinated [140]. Impact of s ocial media on knowledge of the HPV vaccine A study conducted in the United States found that participants with greater exposure to Facebook post notifications were more likely to have a higher level of knowledge about HPV and the vaccine, but were no more likely to be vaccinated [144] . A Canadian study that used social media as one tool in an education campaign on HPV vaccination and cervical cancer concluded that social media did not have a significant impact on HPV vaccination uptake in university students [146] . Another study in Canada found that the rhetoric -style of a video (whether evidence- based or anecdotal) did not have an impact on medical students' responses to informational questions about seasonal influenza and vaccines [43]. A qualitative study in the United States found that a large majority of the 18 university students in their study exposed to messages on Facebook, Twitter and Vine had heard of HPV vaccination following the campaig n and most of them believed the vaccine was successful at preventing cervical cancer [147] . Use of existing national or international so cial media platforms developed t o respond to vaccine hesitancy One study looked at Vaccines Today, a website with various associated social media channels (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) developed to provide factual information about vaccination [139] . The study found that their most popular content was a post on their Facebook account ' how measles can change a life' (average reading time: 7 minutes 16 seconds, views: 233 996) and an animation video on YouTube showing how herd protection works (53 000 views). The second study described an Italian Facebook campaign by the Italian Alliance of Vaccination Strategies, designed to share information about vaccination three times a week using short messages (with images) selected by health professionals and scientific communication experts [141] . The study looked at the number of likes on each of the posts, and found that Facebook event pages were the most popular type of communications, followed by press releases and scientific publications. Press releases were the most shared types of posts, followed by scientific publications and institutional documents. Facebook users were found to like and share more posts on Fridays. 5.4.2 Use of online group discussions to engage the publi c The impact of engaging the public in online group discussions on vaccine uptake and confidence w as analysed in three articles - one study was conducted in Taiwan [148] , one in the Netherlands [149] , and one in Germany [150] . The three studies aimed to observe effects of online group discussion o n behaviour and attitudes about vaccination. The Taiwanese study found that participants receiving a Facebook -assisted teaching method were more likely to have the intention to be vaccinated than others who received traditional teaching instructions [148] . Knowledge concerning vaccination was significantly higher in the intervention group than the control group. The Dutch study asked parents to share opinions in an online group discussion about vaccinating their daught ers [149] . The results show that parents online had a similar influence to that of friends and offline peers. Nonetheless, family members appear to have the strongest influence, suggesting that social media interventions might need to concentrate on family members rather th an individual decision -makers. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 35 The German study compared the use of factual information and personal experience in an Internet forum post on the subsequent nature and volume of responses [150]. The researchers found that while personal experience posts did not result in significantly more responses, the responses were more emotional in nature [150] . 5.4.3 Development of websites with an interactive component Four articles reported on w ebsites with built -in interactive, social- media like components and its effects on vaccine attitudes and beliefs, detailed below. Two articles report on the same study, conducted in the Uni ted States between September 2013 and 2016 [151,152] . Both studies are based on a single site randomi sed controlled trial testing the effects of interactive websites. Despite reporting on the same study, both articles had different outcomes: in one study, interventions were associated with significant reductions in parental concerns surrounding vaccination - nonetheless no change was observed in vaccine- related attitudes. In the second article, infants with parents who had received the intervention were twice as likely to have received MMR vaccination than infants with parents in the control group, although this was not significant. A third article reports on an interactive website developed by the Italian health authority to inform the population in relation to vaccination safety and benefit s [153] . The website was intended for the Italian population in general and for healthcare workers. It used Twitter to advertise its use and drive traffic to the website. Most visits to the website we re from populations in Rome and Milan. The website remained one of the top results in Google after only one month of intervention, indicating a high number of visits and the potential of such initiatives. One article aimed to create a web- based tool to pr ovide evidence -based information where parents can contribute with content and discuss concerns with other parents and vaccine experts [154] . Based on a manual medical record review, a set of surveys was sent randomly to parents in the US who accepted vaccines, parents who delayed vaccination and parents who refused vaccination. Fifty percent of parents in all three vaccine groups reported they would use the web -based tool more often. The overall results from this study suggest that the web tool may represent an effective intervention tool to help parents make informed vaccination decision s for their children. Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 36 6. Discussion This report provides the results from a systematic scoping review, conducted with the following objectives: to identify preferences for using social media as a source for vaccination information and the influence that social media have on individuals' perceptions of vaccination; to identify different social media monitoring methods and tools in monitoring vaccination and assess their strengths and weaknesses; to review how social media monitoring methods and information gathered from the monitoring can be used to inform communication strategies; to identify the uses, benefits and limitations of using social media as an intervention tool in relation to vaccination (i.e. how effective social media are as an intervention tool for increasing vaccination). An extensive database search led to the inclusion of 115 articles: 13 on the use of social media, 85 on social media monitoring, 15 on interventions, one with both social media monitoring and a social media intervention, and one with both an intervention and an analysis of social media users' opinions about social media. The results from these three categories are summarised and discussed in detail below. 6.1 Use of social media for vaccination information In this systematic scoping review, social media w ere identified as a common source of information on vaccination . However , the way in which this information is c onveyed and consumed was found to vary according to the social media platform used, countries and specific populations. This finding resonates with a global study on social media usage, which found that social media dynamics were dependent on the local social dynamics. This study concluded that, in fact, users shape social media platform dynamics rather than the other way around [23]. Individuals commonly use social media to look for health information, and more importantly, are often exposed to information about vaccination online without necessarily looking for it. Summary of the key findings on the use of social media for vaccination information and the influence on perceptions The types of social media platforms and their use vary by country and by population group (e.g. pregnant women 's consumption of vaccine infor mation on social media was found to be different from the general population). There is a need to have an understanding of who may influence decision making, for example one study included in this review found that family members often have the strongest i nfluence on vaccination- decision making, highlighting the importance of communication and interventions target ing entire families and possible influencers rather than solely at the main decision -makers [149] . Social media interventions to address vaccine hesitancy should t arget specific populations. Public health authorities should first seek to understand what platforms their local populations use (e.g. parents, versus adolescents, v ersus pregnant women), as well as the local context in which individuals use social media, before developing social media communication strategies. The negative relationship between the extent of social media usage a nd views about vaccination should certainly be evaluated further , especially as social media are an important communication channe l in public health. These findings may reflect the fact that information on social media has traditionally been more negative concerning vaccination: as users are more often exposed to negative information and views concerning vaccination online, they them selves become more hesitant to vaccinate [13,22] . 6.2 Methodologies to monitor social media in relation to vaccination This scoping review found a large number of studies published on social media monitoring and analysis around vaccination, with significant increase in the number of articles published since 2015. This increase exposes a growing academic interest in the field of social media in health, particularly within the context of ' fake news' and 'post-factual societies ' [155] . The large number of studies analysing social media relating to vaccination may also represent a n acknowledgement of the contribution of social media to growing vaccine hesitancy and a need to better understand how users communicate about vaccination on social media and how information about vaccination spreads between and within online social networ ks [156] . However, social media monitoring still represents a new methodological approach for h ealth research, with a lack of standardised methodology f or collect ing and analys ing data. While the large number of articles identified via the scoping review provided sufficient evidence to summarise methods (e.g. tools for retrieving social media data, or methods for sentiment and location) that have been used to monitor social media, almost none of the articles TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 37 evaluated the precision and accuracy of their monitoring and analysis methodologies. Lack of evaluation and standardisation is reflected in the fact that articles published on social media monitoring are extremely varied in style, methodology, and complexity. Social media monitoring constitutes a new research methodology, with many challenges for defining methodologies but also opportunities for public health. A discussion of the findings from the social media monitoring studies is presented below based on the three social media monitoring phases - 1) preparation 2) data extraction and 3) data analysis. 1) Preparation Purpose of social media monito ring The purpose of social media monitoring in relation to vaccination dictates the platform/s to be monitored, period of monitoring, analysis and messaging to be conducted. Representativeness Generally, the aim of social media monitoring studies was to provide a better understanding of how the population thinks and talks about vaccination, thereby requiring representativeness to be able to generali se the analys is results to whole populations. Studies where the objectives are to obtain an overview of the use of social media and perceptions of vaccination tend to position social media monitoring as an alternative to surveys or qualitative interviews in obtaining data on vaccination beliefs and opinions, without acknowledging that the notion of representativeness radic ally changes with social media. There are limitations on t he lack of representativeness of social media populations. There is evidence that social media users, especially those discussing vaccination, tend to represent particular population groups (e.g. younger, often female individuals) [87]. In this way, social media monitoring cannot be used as a research tool to increase representativeness and access entire populations, but it can be a research methodology for s tudying a new type of population. Social media users could be considered as a n ew independent population group, and the field of social media monitoring could be seen as an opportunity to understand what information social media users are exposed to and how information about vaccination is shared and spread online. However, social me dia monitoring comes with challenges in terms of representativeness, as access to data is often limited due to inaccessible private content, the challenge of studying all social media platforms at once, or limitations imposed by automated software. Redefin ing social media monitoring for vaccination as studying a new type of population may prove valuable for public health , recognising that social media offer opportunities that go beyond updating existing research methodologies. Social media monitoring opens the door to more dynamic research that continuously evolves and responds to a constantly evolving world. Twitter bias One of the main reasons why there has been such a bias towards the use of Twitter in a majority of studies within this review may be that Twitter provides the most openly available API, both for free and paid access for developers and researchers. There is a need to apply caution to results collected solely from Twitter. S tudies using these freely collected tweets only represent a small 1% sample of all tweets posted and are therefore not representative of all posts on vaccine hesitancy [157] . Accessing the free Twitter API also involves issues related to periodical collection - the API itself is restricted to intermittent collection points, so that Twitter's servers are not overloaded with requests. This means that any collections are limited to pockets of time and do not represent continuous data collection. Therefore ev en with access to a 1% sample over a period of seven days, there will be gaps in the stream of tweets collected, as Twitter moderates collection times - meaning that even the 1% sample is truncated [158] . Furthermore, population groups are known to access different types of social media platforms, and a focus on Twitter may overlook the concerns of younger individuals, such as teenagers, who more commonly use Instagram or Snapchat [159] . Ethical considerations around social m edia monitoring It is worth noting that most studies included in this report did not seek ethics approval, as it is often considered that information on social media is public (unless otherwise stated, for instance in private profiles on Facebook). The argument is that social media users who make their data public do not constitute human research subjects, who would be defined as ' living individuals about whom an investigator obtains data through interaction with the individual or identifiable private infor mation ' [160] . Even though researchers in previous studies may not have been legally compelled to obtain full social media eth ics approval, the lack of guidance on good ethical conduct when using social media information can be considered a cause for concern. Issues of confidentiality and anonymi sation of data still arise, as some studies included in this review published screenshots of users' data that included users' profile names. Another issue relates to data coming from minors, which should be considered more carefully, even when publicly available [160] . While these concerns should not unduly hinder the development of social media monitoring as a research field, they should however highlight th at there is a need for guidelines to ensure ethical conduct, respect for social media users, and therefore the importance of submitting research proposals on social media monitoring to ethics boards for approval. While some guidelines have been published on ethical conduct regarding studies recruiting participa nts online, such as those from the British Psychological Society [136] , there is still a large gap regardin g social media monitoring. Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 38 Recent controversies with regard to the exploitation of users' data in the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal, and the public outcry of users feeling unnerved about being monitored and manipulated, have indeed opened up di scussions and initiatives for legislation concerning the ethics of handling user data from social media in both corporate mark eting and research [161] . Facebook announced a number of API changes designed to better protect user information between 2017 and 2019. As a result, t hese restrictions, along with GDPR laws, pose further limitations on the research that can be conducted on social media platforms [162,163] . General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) The overall aim of the recen tly implemented GDPR is to increase people's control over their own personal data and 'to protect all EU citizens from privacy and data breaches in an increasingly data -driven world' [164] . For companies, organisations and researchers this means obtaining consent to use and retain customers' personal data; while granting more rights to t he 'data subject' to be informed and to control how their personal data are used. In light of this , digital analytics companies have had to legally adopt the GDPR into data access policies in order to harvest social media data where there is automated acce ss to social media APIs, such as the Twitter Firehose, and the Instagram API . Moreover, social media platforms themselves have had to adapt how data are shared with third parties [135] . Such recent policy changes may in turn change the way that researchers who used automated software to sample social media, will have to anonymise data in the future. They may also restrict which sections of social media platforms (e.g. public Facebook pages v ersus private groups) are available for research [165] . There have also been steps within the research community to devise ways of anonymising user data in social media research, by differentiating research use of these data from marketing analytics, and devising ways to make sure academic use falls both within GDPR and wider ethical guidelines [135] . 2) Data extraction Complexity of monitoring social media on different platforms over long periods of time This scoping review has found that information on vaccination is available across different social media platforms, and that diffe rent methods and formats of communication are currently being used to post, share and spread information about vaccination online (e.g. tweets, Facebook and forum posts and comments, images, followers, videos and Pinterest clippings). This makes it hard to have a standardised way of collecting and analysing data, or to obtain a continuous sample of what people are discussing or sharing with regard to vaccine hesitancy. The majority of studies that had the largest datasets, collected over longer time period s, tended to be those that had access to the API of a social platform such as Twitter, or to automated data collection and media monitoring tools. Studies with smaller samples experienced more limitations and used less sophisticated keyword searches, often relying on manual data collection, and were thus constrained by time, resources, and the limitations of the browser tools being used within the social media platforms. It was found that the studies using browser search tools within the social media platf orms they were analysing had smaller samples that were less representative of the overall population they were studying, while the periods of collection were shorter. The use of browser search tools in general can limit the size and time period of data collected, as these search tools are built for basic searches by the platform 's users, who use them on a smaller scale for general search queries, rather than more detailed comprehensive data retrieval and analysis. More intensive use of social media APIs re quires a strong knowledge of programming, analytics and data harvesting. The use of automated software for media monitoring through commercial social media analytics platforms offer s access to such data, however these can be cost -prohibitive, or do not giv e public health organisations and researchers the kind of data that they require. This is because most automated digital analytics platforms are built with corporate marketing analysis and branded content in mind - and thus not able to directly tackle, ann otate or analyse research questions through a social sciences or public health lens [157] . Once harvested, the data need to be cleaned and analysed in a way that answers public health questions, rather than those linked to brand marketing (e.g. brand strength, brand influencers, and brand trends) or product trends [157] [166]. In recent years t here have been increasing opportunities for academics to work in partnership with data analytics companies to forge a better understanding of how to look at social media images and text from a social sciences and public policy perspective [167] . While manual searches using browser -based tools within soc ial media platforms have been found to yield smaller sample sizes over shorter periods of time, it might be assumed that studies that have used the paid version of the Twitter API (the 'firehose') via automated monitoring, have a more representative sample. This is because access to paid data has been found to offer researchers an array of tweet s/posts, user s, and more data for analysis, usually with access to all historical and current tweets. However, there are still issues with the relative openness of the paid access to Twitter, Facebook or YouTube APIs, which themselves are still proprietary, and do not advertise the mechanisms behind collection or output of data. Thus, public health organisations and researchers do not know the full detail s of commerci al API sample data, or indeed what percentage of ' all' data they are given. Th us, the commercial/automated API acts as a ' blackbox ' filter that may not yield representative data [168,169] . Therefore, not only does the commercial API preclude analysis as to the representativeness of the sample but it also prevents public health officials and researchers from fully comparing studies over time, as the AP I sampling algorithm itself will change. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 39 Studies of social media may often fail to use standardised methods that permit interpretation beyond individual studies. In developing methods to analys e social media data, researchers have not drawn on a coherent body of agreed- upon methodologies. Rather, analysis of the literature shows that methodological choices differ considerably from one paper to another, and the validity of the chosen methodologies often cannot be adequately demonstrated [170]. This may be due to the ever -changing landscape of social media platforms, in terms of the structuring, formatting and access to data. Thus, while there is no standardisati on of methods for conducting social media monitoring, it has been found that studies tend to try a little bit of everything - creating an amalgamation of research methods and analyses. There are c urrently no standards for the right sample size per social network, no recomme nded time period for different types of analysis per platform, and no recommendations for studying outside or within the extremes of positive or negative views (which are not always representative of the general population). There is also currently no gene ral standardisation of which specific API tools or analytical classifiers should be used for good overall analysis of network discourse, interaction or trends, within the academic or commercial data analytics sphere. However, despite all of these drawbacks , this review has found that the fast -evolving nature of different social media platforms, the cross -over of shared data, boundaries to privacy, and public policy surrounding public discourse on vaccine hesitancy and disease outbreaks , may necessitate a mo re methodologically diverse approach to keep up with ever -changing developments. It may also be ap propriate for methodologies to remain flexible , as the nature and access to social media discourse on vaccines and public health changes . Changes in platform content In terms of data flows, as concerns grow about the presence of anti -vaccine sentiments on social media and the effect this has on real -world vaccine uptake, social media platforms are beginning to l isten to requests from public bodies and are gradu ally alter ing their content. One such platform is Pinterest, which has recently taken anti -vaccine items off its platform [171]. Facebook and YouTube have also pledged to remove anti -vaccine videos from their platforms [172]. YouTube has taken revenue -generating a ds off anti -vaccine videos, in a pledge to de -monetise anti -vaccine groups [173]. Facebook has additionally banned anti -vaccine ads targeting specific groups [174] , while Twitter has included a 'Know the Facts ' box for users searching for anti -vaccination tweets [175], and Instagram is using AI to filter anti -vaccine content via an information box directing users to information on vaccines [176] . These actions from social platforms may change what users see and what researchers study in terms of sentiment and vaccine sentiment. Anti -vaccine groups may migrate from platforms that no longer monetise or make it eas y for them to share information, to other platforms from which it may be harder to gather data or analyse, as is possible with Twitter and Facebook APIs. As platfor ms such as Pinterest, YouTube and Facebook chang e due to political pressure, and begin to mod erate the sharing of anti -vaccine and far-right content on their platforms , certain discussion s may potential ly become even more diversified and complex as a result of the way in which they are shared, engaged and enacted upon within the ever -changing land scape of the internet and social media [177] . The importance of search queries and the choice of keywords Overall, studies with platforms such as Pinterest or YouTube used simpler monit oring methods (i.e. using the browser search tools) due to restrictions in accessing these platforms' APIs compar ed to Twitter. For example, Pinterest necessitates manual sample collection because no API is publicly available to collect pins by either keyw ord or account handle [125]. In studies using browser search tools, the keyw ord search queries were much more simplistic, with just one to three keywords used, which means that the quality of the data output may be less stringent than data accessed using more rigorous Boolean search queries when accessing data from the Twitter API . The small number of studies looking at other social media platforms compared to t he large bias towards Twitter may again be because Twitter has made its API more easily available, and the data output more rigorous . This makes it an attractive, if not necessarily more representative sample of conversation around vaccine hesitancy across social media. Poor keyword searches can result in data that are not necessa rily representative of the real conversations on the social network being studied. There has been a recent call to better standardise practices of keyword search terms in health research on social media, so that the quality of the data query matches the quality of the data that the platforms give out, and therefore the resulting study [178] . However, there should be enough flexibility t o acknowledge the constantly evolving, context -specific nature of social media. It is important to ensure that research questions are also grounded within non -digital empirical research and public health frameworks, so that any social media research around vaccines also demonstrates an awareness of the wider social milieu, and is not unduly skewed or restricted in scope by the constraints of the social platforms or devices used [179] . Visualisation of data The lack of methodological standardisation discussed above also constitutes a problem in terms of visualisation of data. Studies using sophisticated APIs to retrieve data can also benefit from sophisticated tools to analyse data , such as comprehensive social network analysis charts showing key conversation clusters, influential groups, and scatter plots of influence over time. The less sophisticated the keywords search or tool of analysis, the less detailed and informative the data visualisation may be , with simpler diagrams and tables able to show data for smaller data samples, but these may not necessarily be as representative. Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 40 3) Data analysis The challenge of obtaining location inform ation Another challenge posed by social media monitoring is the geographical scope of data. Most of the studies identified in this review were either conducted globally or chose not to restrict data to a specific country. One of the challenges is for socia l media APIs and other monitoring tools to provide easier ways o f locating tweets, without infringing on the privacy rights users have chosen. Until this is resolved, social media monitoring with a national or regional scope will remain extremely difficult to conduct. It is di fficult to obtain geo -location data from social media. Many users may decide to keep their location private, which means some studies had to resort to consulting the users' profile pages or other manual techniques to identify locations (raising ethical considerations). Other studies restricted resu lts by language, generally by using language -specific keywords. As the specific nature of vaccine hesitancy is country - and context -specific, and should be addressed as such, the difficulty in obtaining national social media data on vaccination will also pose challenges when using social media information to inform vaccination interventions and communication strategies. Analysing complex sentiments The difficulty of assessing sentiment in the context of public health remains a key problem in almost all arti cles, where it was found necessary to code social media data so that they could be analysed beyond the basic negative or positive sentiment of marketing analysis. There is a difficulty in coding sentiments such as sarcasm and hesitancy, whether using manua l or automated coding [66]. When multiple researchers are used, manual coding and analysis of sentiments, especially complex ones, is often prone to subjectivity biases, and can be extremely time-consuming. However, s etting -up automate d algorithms to analyse data through machine learning requires advanced computing and programmatic skills. Coding of images The coding of images on platforms such as P interest and Instagram also poses a challenge with automated coding of sentiment, as image coding algorithms are still in their infancy, and not always readily available on a large scale outside of Google's DeepMind, expensive facial recognition packages or image search. APIs for visual social media platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat are restrictive or even non -existent, even though those platforms are increasingly being used, particularly by younger individuals. Studies analysing videos, for example on YouTube are also more time -intensive and time- costly for researchers, as each video ne eds to be watched and annotated. This may change now that as of 2018, YouTube allows the download of transcripts (where available), and these transcripts can in turn be put into automated software to analyse sentiment [180] . Methodologically, over the last 10 years, it has been challenging to study vast amounts of visual social media data concerning vaccine hesitancy - studies have focused on examining text [181] . However, while the process of studying large amounts of video and images has previously been labour -intensi ve, with the need to use human coding of images t o discern themes and subjects, th e progress of image recognition and AI technology over recent years has meant that conducting rich content analysis studies of big data from images or videos is becoming more prevalent [182] . There will be new insights into public health discourse coming from new and continuing research in the field of multimodal sentiment analysis using video, images, and captioned text analysis [183- 186]. Summary of the key findings on social media monitoring There is a growing research interest in social media monitoring concerning vaccination, acknowledging the role of social media in vaccine hesitancy. Social media monitoring is a new area of research methodology, which can help national health authorities understand how information about vaccination is shared and spread online. Social media monitoring should take into account important ethical considerations in terms of access to public and private data, the use of human research subjects, and confidentiality and anonymity (particularly for vulnerable populations). At present, there are no standardised methods for monitoring and analysing social media in relation to vaccination, and more tools need to be evaluated. Social media can easily be monitored manually by researchers or health authorities but this can be time- consuming, and the results can be o f limited accuracy or completeness, limit ing analysis to small non - representative samples. Automated softw are can provide better results but it requires highly technical computational skills and can be expensive. Most automated analyses are limited to Twitter, which creates an unbalanced representation of online content. Researchers and health authorities sho uld pay attention to the platforms used specifically by their population of interest. Vaccine hesitancy is context - and country -specific and social media monitoring should be conducted to reflect this. However, there is still a lack of methods for obtain ing location information on social media. Sentiment analysis is an important tool for analysing social media content concerning vaccination but is prone to subjectivity biases, especially when conducted manually. While it should go further than simple negati ve/positive categorisation of sentiments to reflect the complexity of sentiments around vaccination, it can be difficult to code sentiments, such as sarcasm or hope. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 41 Social media monitoring has public health implications. It can be used to detect increases in online activity, shifts in sentiments or other signals of decreasing confidence in vaccination; as a tool for health authorities to increase their presence and popularity on social media; and finally as a real -time listening tool to anticipate, underst and and respond to public questions and concerns. Social media monitoring should be seen as a constantly evolving area of research methodology , to reflect the continuous growth of the social media environment, and the constant shift of users and content to newer platforms. Suggestions for future research Evaluation of the different social media monitoring tools (e.g. methods for coding and analysing sentiments could be compared, to identify those offering more valid and reliable results. ) This would allow researchers to develop a gold standard or best practice guide on how to conduct media monitoring for health research . Visualis ation of s ocial media analytics in public health. A growing body of research , both within this review and withi n social sciences in general, is concerned with developing innovative solutions to the data visualisation problem, looking at both the visualisation of social media discourse and the research field of visual analytics itself . This may have a more cohesive effect on the visualisation of data over time [187] . Development and improvement of m ethod s for geo -locating tweets. Improvement of the understanding of complex themes such as hesitancy, promotional content and discouraging content and development of measurement methods for risk p erception, or patterns of change in sentiment over time [188] . This is particularly important for discussions concerning v accination, which can elicit complex sentiments. Coding of more complex sentiments on social media to be able to u nderstand the nuances in sentiments with a view to providing better respon ses to vaccine hesitancy. 6.3 Review how social media monitoring methods and information gathered from monitoring can be used to inform communication s trategies The studies from the scoping review did not formally evaluate how social media monitoring methods and information gathered can be used to inform communication strategies. H owever , based on various findings, some studies recommended that health au thorities, governments and/o r healthcare professionals can monitor social media in order to detect increases in online activity, shifts in sentiments, or other signals that may have an influence on vaccination uptake or confidence in real time. The studies also recognised that social media monitoring could help health authorities anticipate, understand and respond to public questions and concerns. For example, a study was conducted by the European Medicines Agency in 2015 to monitor online discourses around HPV vaccination in Europe ahead of the release of new safety data [189] . Findings from the study were used to identify common public concerns and question s concerning HPV vaccination, which were then addressed during a press conference. The stud y demonstrated the utility of media monitoring to support communication preparedness. In addition, there are benefits that health authorities could gain from increasing their presence, and their popularity on social media , such as an increase in public tru st and recognition . There is, however, a need for public health risk communicators, researchers and officials to be aware that not all posts are necessarily made by humans, and that sophisticated automated bots and human trolls (posters of polarising content) are actively involved in online public health discourse. Research and algorithmic approaches have found that it is not easy to identify sophisticated bots or trolls, especially as some post both pro - and anti - vaccination narratives, consistent with a s trategy of promoting political discord [ 57]. Summary of key findings on how social media monitoring methods and i nformation gathered from the monitoring can be used to inform communication strategies Monitoring can be a useful listening tool for public health institutes to gain a broad understanding of prevailing issues of interest and concerns in certain communities and to detect key themes or questions concerning v accination among the population. Continuous monitoring can be used to investigate how public concerns change over time and how questions about vaccines have tended to change with periodical consistency, e nabling health authorities to develop tailored, targeted, cost -effective and responsive public engagement. Consistent, long -term communication activity may be more beneficial than reactive or event -driven public health communication, a finding that may be useful for planning policy around public health interventions to increase vaccine confidence. Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 42 Other beneficial uses of monitoring to support health authorities in developing communication strategies include: semantic network analysis of sentiments; identifying the platforms people use to gather information about vaccines; measuring engagement to detect more popular content and better understand how it is shared; examin ing the effectiveness of vaccine promotion strategies; flagging anti -vaccine website s; information on adverse- events following immunisation surveillance ; producing spatio -temporal indicators to determine where and when concerns are growing; during vaccine -preventable disease outbreaks, c reating adaptive message s at different stages of the crisis. Suggestions for future research More detailed evaluations of how social media monitoring methods and information gathered from monitoring have informed different communication strategies Detailed sharing of practices and country experiences of utilising social media monitoring and analysis in forming communication messages and strategies. 6.4 Understanding the uses, benefits and limitations of using social media as an intervention around vaccination Three types of intervention using social media to address vaccination have been identified through this systematic scoping review - interventions that use social media as a communication channel to share information with the public ; interventions that engage the public using online group discussions and interventions that use interactive websites with an integrated social media component to provide information and engage users. Effect of s ocial media interventions on vaccine uptake None of the interventions summarised in this scoping review were fou nd to significantly increase vaccine uptake. However , we should be careful when interpret ing this finding. First of all, it is very rare to be able to point to an intervention and say with precision that an individual was vaccinated specifically because of that intervention (or its social media component). Furthermore, the results from this review may not specifically reflect the benefits and limitations of social media as a communication channel since they are dependent on the type of content and messaging strategies used in these interventions and the fact that social media are only one of many channel s for communicat ing with the public . This demonstrates the complexity of establishing the benefits and limitations of social media as a tool for address ing vaccination, and the importance of other factors that may influence vaccine uptake when communicating (such as targeted messaging, choice of language, style and framing of messages, engagement of users, or source of information. ) One study showed that loss- framed messages on Facebook were associated with a significantly higher intention to get vaccinated than gain -framed messages [142] . Another study showed that whenever adverse events are mentioned in a narrative manner, intentions to vaccinate decrease - no matter whether the information comes from pro - or anti -vaccination sources [140] . These results highlight t he fact that social media should not be seen as a magic bullet for addressing vaccine hesitancy but s hould be used as part of a broader communication strategy that acknowledges the influence of these other factors. If used adequately, social media ha ve been seen to successfully mitigate vaccine hesitancy. For example, Denmark's and Ireland's successful strateg ies of using social media platforms to engage with vaccine- hesitant parents and restore confidence in HPV vaccination eventually led to an increas e in HPV vaccine coverage [33,34] . Effect of s ocial media interventions on a ttitudinal change The impact of social media interventions on a ttitudinal change seemed easier to verify than on vaccine uptake . Some interventions conducted with the aim of providing information about vaccination on Facebook in the US were found to significantly increase knowledge in relation to the HPV vaccine, while decreasing perceived barriers to HPV vaccination and perception s of risk [142- 144]. Facebook -assisted teaching methods were also found to increase knowledge and intentions to be vaccinated in Taiwan [148] . A randomised- controlled trial in the US found that interactive websites with a space for parents to contribute with content and discuss concerns significantly reduced parental concerns concerning vaccination - although no impact was found on vaccine -related attitudes [151] . Many of the metrics that measure user engagement should be analysed carefully, as stated by the concept of 'vanity metrics' where positive feedback (such as views and likes) do es not necessarily reflect the real performance of a social media strategy. Much of the data attached to social media are not intrinsically useful for furthering the aims of specific campaigns. While numbers may look appealing (e.g. a large number of likes and viewers), it is hard to say how they might be linked to particular behaviour. More detailed evaluations and surveys are needed to confirm those results. Outcomes of social media interventions and their content messaging were found to vary by nationality and local culture and it is therefore difficul t to summarise the benefits and limitations of using social media as an intervention tool in relation to vaccination . Furthermore, local cultures and politics filter through an international TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy 43 arena where geography does not explicitly matter. Hence, local co ncerns and politics about vaccines exist offline and then encounter each other in various fora which are completely location- agnostic. That may pose challenges when considering country -specific interventions; knowing how specific campaigns targeted specifi c geographies or handled this challenge would be particularly interesting. Another reason why this scoping review cannot identify the benefits and limitations of social media interventions to address vaccine hesitancy is the lack of standardised approach, the different methodologi es used and the range of research questions. While this richness in research contributes greatly to the understanding of how vaccine hesitancy and confidence can be addressed, the downside is that it makes it difficult to compare a nd establish common ground for interventions. Summary of the key findings on social media interventions to address vaccine hesitancy Although no social media intervention was found to significantly increase vaccine uptake , it may be difficult to accurately link an individual's vaccination status to a specific component of an intervention. This is particularly true as social media are only the channel for communication and other factors, such as the content or style of messages (loss-framed vs gain -framed messages, narratives vs. scientific facts) also influence beliefs and behaviour. Social media interventions were found to positively influence attitudes related to vaccination, including knowledge, perceived barriers and risk perceptions. Results vary by country and population group and it would be very helpful if national health authorities that have used social media to respond to vaccine confidence evaluated the impact of their interventions and shared their findings . Suggestions for future research More detailed evaluations and surveys are needed to see how metrics, such as number of likes and viewers, might inform specific strategies and drive particular behaviour. Further research is needed on different types of communication strategies and how they influence vaccine uptake, such as targeted messaging, choice of language, style and framing of messages, engagement of users, or the source of the information . More studies are needed to confirm the effects of social media interventions in differ ent contexts and there should be more sharing of experience across different countries. 6.5 Limitations of this systematic scoping literature review The findings from this systematic scoping review should not be discussed without mentioning some study limitations. While an extensive search strategy was used to identify articles - screening multiple databases and using a comprehensive set of keywords - the search was only conducted using English keywords. This could have influenced the finding that most arti cles use English keywords to monitor social media. Articles in Spanish and Italian were included for analysis, and although no articles were found in other languages, a more comprehensive search using keywords in other languages could have identified a lar ger number of articles. In order to strengthen the selection process, two reviewers independently screened all articles by title and abstract, and then by full text. However, it is important to note that data extraction was conducted by four researchers, w ho divided the 115 articles among themselves. Although they used the same data extraction sheet, this could have led to some inconsistencies in data extraction. While the search for interventions and social media monitoring strategies was conducted in a systematic manner that should have identified all articles published on these topics, some articles may have been missed on social media users' preferences and vaccination information sources. It is possible that articles which did not specifically mention social media as a finding in their abstract might have been overlooked and excluded from the study. The number of articles included in th e report for this category should therefore be treated with caution. Finally, the use of social media to address vacci ne hesitancy (whether in the form of social media monitoring or interventions developed to communicate using social media) is still relatively new. Many experiences and real -life cases have not been published in publically available peer -reviewed journals or reports, and could therefore not be included in this review. The review may therefore not represent all the methods and interventions that have been developed to monitor social media and address vaccine hesitancy. Systematic scoping review on social media monitoring methods and interventions relating to vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 44 7. Conclusions and the way forward As social media are becoming part of everyday life, exposure to online information about vaccination, often negative, is becoming more common . This has been shown to contribute to a decrease in public confidence in vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy is now see n by many national and international immunisation specialists as a major threat to public health. The increasing use of social media by individuals to find information about vaccination, together with the ever - growing volume of information against vaccina tion available on social media should constitute a call for action. Vaccine hesitancy cannot be addressed unless we are better able to understand the role that social media play in vaccine decision -making, the type of information that social media users ar e exposed to and the way in which t his information is spread and shared across the world. This review has found that while many studies have been conducted with the aim of analysing online content relating to vaccination, the methodologies used are extrem ely varied. As a minimum, it is recommended that health authorities, health professionals or others with an interest in monitoring social media around vaccination collect data relating to the sentiments and content of social media posts, the reach and infl uence of these posts, and if available, geo -location data. Even though automated systems (whether for collect ing or analys ing data) require some computational skills and have certain limitations , such as access to certain platforms, they provide the most robust data and are less time- intensive than manual systems. Different APIs or other software may be used and will be particularly helpful for ongoing continuous surveillance systems used to detect signals of decreasing confidence in vaccination. Sentiment analyses, whether conducted using a manual or automated system, should also aim to move beyond a positive v ersus negative model to truly reflect the content and emotions of social media posts. Decisions around sample sizes and periods of data collection mo nitored will be highly dependent on the resources available and health authorities should therefore consider the recruitment of staff dedicated to these new types of surveillance systems. Research into the platforms used by local populations in different c ountries should inform the decision to monitor specific social media platforms. F or example, monitoring Instagram or Snapchat will be more beneficial to understand how adolescents share information concerning vaccination. More evaluation of social media m onitoring and analysis techniques, from data collection to content and sentiment analyses, is still needed in order to inform the development of validated standardised approaches. In the context of GDPR and discussions around the privacy of online informat ion, an ethical code of conduct relating to media monitoring should also be developed to ensure the respect and anonymity of social media users. It is crucial that health authorities and immunisation manager s start incorporating social media monitoring as part of their traditional vaccination surveillance strategies - and not only after a confidence crisis occurs. While a gold standard of evaluated and effective methodologies to monitor social media may be useful for health authorities, it is also importan t that automated software , facilitating more accurate and comprehensive social media monitoring and analysis, is made more accessible and user -friendly, to allow health authorities or those without computational skills to perform media monitoring. Finally , the purpose and value of social media monitoring should be clearly defined - by both researchers and immunisation specialists. While some may try to use social media as a proxy for what the public thinks about vaccination, the reality is often much more complex. Social media monitoring should therefore be seen as a way of capturing the essence and the movement of online discourse around vaccination in order to better understand how it can influence public perceptions and decision -making concerning vaccina tion. Such evidence could then inform the development of targeted interventions to maintain or restore public confidence in vaccination. The purpose of thi s review was to analyse the social media monitoring techniques and interventions. A potential next s tep could be to conduct a deeper analysis of the key themes retrieved from the results of the studies addressing social media monitoring of vaccination and how these results can further support public health institutes with monitoring and communication related to vaccine hesitancy.

Description of studies that consider the preferences for using social media platforms as a source of information and influence on perceptions of vaccination Reference Study aim(s) Study details Using social media to gain/share information about vaccines Social media influencing vaccine attitudes and/or uptake Ahmed 2018 [39] Examine the rel ationship between social media use and vaccine uptake and determine if there are differences by social media platform. Social media type : Facebook, Twitter Vaccine : Influenza Country : United States With regard to social media use, the study found that Face book was a more popular platform (62% of participants) than Twitter (15%) to find information on the influenza vaccine. This study considered the relationship between social media use and vaccine uptake. Researchers found that individuals who used Facebook or Twitter as sources of health information were more likely to be vaccinated than those who did not use Facebook or Twitter as a source of health information. However, the analysed data also revealed that Twitter users were less likely to be vaccinated t han non -Twitter users. Campbell 2017[41] Understand p arents' opinion on vaccines and vaccine - preventable diseases, their vaccination experiences and what affects their vaccination decisions Social media type : Facebook, Twitter, Discussion forums Vaccine : General childhood vaccines Country : United Kingdom This study found 34% of parents used the Internet to find information about immunisations. Within this group (626 parents), 13% used Facebook or Twitter and 6% used discussion for. This study found that parents who used chat rooms/discussion fora to find i nformation about immunisation were more likely to report that they had seen or read something that made them doubt vaccinations (31% of parents who used chat rooms/discussion forums versus 8% of all parents). This was also true for parents who used Faceboo k or Twitter (23%). Dilley 2018 [38] Develop a compreh ensive assessment of HPV vaccination in Alabama, with the goal to make recommendations for tailored multilevel interventions Social media type : N/A Vaccine : HPV Country : United States Multiple study participants (5 of 7 parents) cited social media as a com mon resource for information. The study found misinformation on social media to be a significant barrier to getting vaccinated, but also suggested social media as a potential facilitator by providing an avenue to propagate positive messaging about the HPV vaccine. Edelstein 2014[50] Ascertain what strategies the National Health Service (NHS) trusts in England have used to increase influenza vaccine uptake in their HCWs between 2008/2009 and 2011/2012 and to identify which specific interventions were associated with an increased vaccine uptake overall and by staff group, in order to inform future HCW vaccination strategies. Social media type : Facebook, Twitter Vaccine : Influenza Country : United Kingdom The study reported an increase in the use of social media interventions on Facebook and Twitter to increase vaccine promotion. In this study, use of Facebook and Twitter were associated with a significantly reduced uptake of vaccines (22% and 24%).

Social media type : N/A Vaccine : Influenza, Pertussis Country : United Kingdom This study focused on pregnant women using social networking sites to make decisions on vaccinations during pregnancy. 21% of the participating women reported using social media to find information on vaccinations during pregnancy, with Facebook and WhatsApp being the most used platforms. 12% of the partic ipants reported that the information they gathered from social media influenced their vaccination decisions. The study found that women who used social media to gather information on vaccinations during pregnancy were 58% less likely to receive the pertuss is vaccination during their pregnancy. No significant relationship was found between social media usage and the influenza vaccination during pregnancy. However, the study also found some platforms for social media were not necessarily associated with a dec reased vaccination uptake - for example, women who used WhatsApp and LinkedIn were statistically more likely to receive the pertussis and influenza vaccines in pregnancy. Hwang 2018 [49] Investigate the associations between evaluations of health information sources, pare ntal perceptions of childhood vaccination benefits, and the m aintenance of vaccination sched ules for children (incorporates social media as a health information source) Social media type : N/A Vaccine : General childhood vaccines Country : United States n/a This study found that using social media as a source for health information was negatively associated with parents' perceptions of the benefits of vaccines. Kim 2018 [40] Examine the relationships between multidimensional health beliefs and HPV vaccine acceptance, and what information sources effectively foster HPV vaccination -related health beliefs. Social media type : Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Vaccine : HPV Country : South Korea The study surveyed undergraduate students in Seoul, South Korea found that 30% of the participants cited social media as a source of HPV information. The findings from this study showed that hearing about HPV and/or the HPV vaccine on social media increased participants' perception of barriers relating to social norms and talking about HPV/the vaccine. Luisi 2018 [45] Explore how Kansan parents/guardians of HPV vaccine -eligible children perceive the vaccine in the conte xts of the health belief model and the social amplification of risk framework , parent/guardian engagement with HPV vaccine -related information, and Facebook representations by general users and the Centers fo r Disease Control and Prevention during the vaccine's first decade on the market. Social media type : Facebook Vaccine : HPV Country : United States In this study 4% of respondents reported that social media was their main source for learning about the HPV va ccine. Additionally, 63% of respondents reported that they had seen some information about the HPV vaccine on social media. Out of the 50 parents and guardians that participated in the study, 28% reported searching for information on the HPV vaccine on soc ial media and 28% reported posting or sharing information about the HPV vaccine on social media. Approximately 10% of the participating parents and guardians (n = 50) felt that social media increased the fear they have of their children having the HPV vaccine. Margolis 2019[46] Understand expo sure to HPV vaccine -related stories . Social media type : N/A Vaccine : HPV Country : United States This study found that 11% of parents who heard HPV vaccine stories came across them on social media.

Social media type : Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube Vaccine : Any vaccine Country : Worldwide Target population : online users Online platform (Vaccines Today) for discussing vaccines and vaccination to improve vaccine uptake by providing factual information about vaccination. Project features a website and several social media channels t argeting the general public, launched in March 2011. In social media interactions, replies are made with information that would be of value to observers who are making decisions about vaccination. The article found that two categories of content were the most popular: storytelling approaches and answers to questions posed by readers. The most popular content of the website was published on Facebook: \"How measles can change a life\" was written by a parent whose son developed subacute sclerosing panencephali tis several years after measles infection in his first year. The article - which is relatively long compared with other content on the site - was read for more than seven minutes, which is long enough to digest the article in full (07:16, 233,996 views). T he authors considered that articles widely read were more successful. The most -viewed video on YouTube was an animation showing how herd immunity works (53,000 views). Haase 2015 [140] Assess the potential moderating effect of statistic and narrative source credibility on the biasing effect of narrative information regarding the perception of vaccination risks. Social media type : Online forum Vaccine : Any vaccine Country : Germany Target population : online users Researchers aimed to understand if the credibility of the source of a forum post influenced the readers' perception of vaccination risk. They did this by presenting identical narratives, but with different introductory texts (one from a neutral online health forum and the other from a known anti -vaccination website). Researchers found that narratives discussing vaccine adverse events decreased intentions to get vaccinated and increased perceptions of vaccination risk. This bias occurred irrespective of whether the post was read on the neutral online health forum or the anti -vaccination website. La Torre 2014[141] Pilot a project with the aim of informing healthcare workers and the general population about vaccination through Facebook and present results of one year of activity.

Information materials chosen by health professionals and scientific communication experts published three times a week. Short and regular messages with breaks of one day approximately between publications. News with images were chosen more often. Likes: Events were the most popular type of news, followed by press releases, and scientific publications. Institutional Videos and documents are forms of communication less considered or appreciated by users. The day of the week in which users were most likely to be attracted by the contents of the links was Friday. Shares : Press releases were the communication form most shared by Facebook users, followed by scientific publications and institutional documents. No sharing of video links.

Social media type : Facebook Vaccine : HPV Country : United States Target population : 142 college students Participants exposed to four scenarios: 1 - a gain -framed message on a fake look -alike Facebook page, 2 - a loss -framed message on a fake look -alike Facebook page; or 3 - a gain -framed message on a fake look -alike New York Times website or a 4 - loss-framed message on a fake look -alike New York Times website. Gain-framed me ssage: health benefits from getting the HPV vaccine (e.g. prevention of cervical cancer or genital warts) Loss-framed message: negative consequences of not getting the HPV vaccine (e.g. getting cervical cancer or genital warts). Perceived severity of HPV : Participants who viewed the Facebook page perceived a lower severity than those who saw the online newspaper (p<0.05) Perceived benefits of getting vaccinated : No statistically significant medium effect between newspaper and Facebook (p=.94) Perceived barriers to getting vaccinated : Participants who viewed the Facebook page perceived lower barriers than those who saw the newspaper (p<.05) Willingness to get vaccinated : Participants who viewed the loss -framed message on Facebook mostly exhibited a higher level of behavioural intention to get vaccinated than those in the gain -framing condition (p<.05). Mohanty 2018[143] Assess the campaign reach, engagement, and HPV vaccine uptake among Philadelphia adolescents through the 3forME campaign. Social media type : Facebook Vaccine : HPV Country : United States Target population : 155,110 adolescents (13 -18) reached Advertisements from 3forME displayed on the right side of the Facebook login page with varied themes, images and text. Link provided to the 3forME Facebook page and website. Messages addressed perceived susce ptibility of HPV disease, severity of HPV infection, and benefits of getting vaccinated. The pages were designed as cues to actions to motivate adolescents to seek the HPV vaccine. Uptake of HPV vaccination : On average, each advertising campaign reached 15 5,110 adolescents and engaged 2106 adolescents. The advertising campaigns that focused on HPV disease risk and local resources were the most successful in engaging adolescents. Overall, 3400 adolescents became fans of the campaign and 176 doses of HPV vaccine were administered to 152 adolescents, out of which 63 received the three doses. Ortiz 2018 [144] Describe the formative research, execution, and evaluation of a social media health intervention to improve adolescents' knowledge ab out and vaccination against HPV. Social media type : Facebook Vaccine : HPV Country : United States Target population : 108 adolescents (13 -18) A Facebook page, \"About your Health\", with information about HPV vaccination and notifications received each time a new message was posted on the page. Maintained by local healthcare providers. 24 health facts (11 about HPV) were posted throughout a three -month period (with images and links to credible websites). Topics included virus susceptibility, virus severity, vaccine benefits, vaccine barriers and self -efficacy. Knowledge : Participants who reported receiving notifications for each new Facebook post were significantly more likely to have an increase in their HPV and vaccine knowledge but not in their vaccination ra tes. Peter 2014 [145] Investigate the potential of online discussions on social network sites to convey health messages and to affect people's judgements regarding health issues. Social media type : Facebook Vaccine : Influenza Country : Germany Target population : 577 adults Facebook page that featured a fictitious person who posted an article from an online magazine about influenza vaccination. The post was followed by five comments about this issue. In one version (pro vaccination version), four of the five comments stated a positive attitude toward flu vaccination, and one comment reported a negative attitude. In the other version (contra vaccination version), this relationship was reversed (four negative and one positive comment). Furthermore, in one version, one of the comments that represented the opi nion of the majority (e.g., a positive comment in the pro vaccination version) was also liked by five other users. In the second version, the single minority comment was liked by five other users. In the third version, no comment was liked. Finally, the po st itself was liked by 24 users. Perceived flu vaccination rate : No effect found from being exposed to user comments in favour of flu vaccination. No significant interaction of comment likes or post likes. Risk perception : Significant effect of the interac tion effect between the exemplars and the evaluation of the stimulus: with a positive stimulus evaluation, the readers of a version with comments supporting vaccination expressed a marginally lower perception of risk than readers of comments opposing vacci nation. For participants with a negative stimulus evaluation, the exact opposite was found. No significant interaction of comment or post likes. Personal attitude and behavioural intention : No main effect of exemplars on personal attitude, but an almost si gnificant effect on behavioural intentions. Readers of comments in favour of vaccination expressed slightly greater intention to be vaccinated than did readers of comments against vaccination. This interaction effect was more pronounced for personal attitu des toward flu vaccination. No significant interaction of comment likes except for the three- way interaction with regard to personal attitude. A significant main effect for post likes emerged with regard to personal attitude: individuals who read a stimulu s version with post likes had a more positive attitude toward flu vaccination than did participants who saw a version without post likes.

Social media type : Facebook and Instagram Vaccine : HPV Country : Canada Target population : 151 This project aimed to use an education campaign on HPV and cervical cancer to increase HPV vaccine uptake at two university campuses in Canada. Pha se II of the project included the education campaign through social media, email communication, information booths and individual solicitation. The precise use of social media in the education campaign is unclear. A Facebook event had 535 invitations, 23 attendees, and 6 shares. Four people posted pictures on Facebook that generated 106 likes. One picture on Instagram generated 45 likes. Robichaud 2012[43] Examine the prior attitudes of first year medical students to seasonal influenza immun isation (their risk -benefit calculation, their sense of vulnerability to seasonal influenza, their overall attitudes towards immuni sation and their immuni sation history) and assess the impact of the most popular vaccine -critical YouTube videos on their attitudes towards seasonal influenza vaccine. Social media type : YouTube Vaccine: Influenza Country : Canada Target population : 41 medical students This study randomly assigned medical students to watch one of two YouTube videos with different rhetorical styles (evidence - based versus anecdotal) and measured any change in attitudes and behaviours before and after watching the video. The study did not find a significant difference in the responses to the questions asked before and after watching the videos. Sundstrom 2018[147] Describe the development, implementation and evaluation of a theory -based cervical cancer prevention communication campaign for college -age women. Social media type : Facebook, Twitter, and Vine Vaccine : HPV Country : United States Target population : 18 university female students Messages communicated about perceived threats, benefits and safety of HPV vaccine. The main campaign message, \"It's my time\", encouraged the cons ideration of HPV vaccination and regular screening, and reminded individuals that it is not too late to receive the HPV vaccine. Messages were delivered through mass media and social media (Facebook, Twitter and Vine). Twitter and Facebook were updated dai ly with relevant news articles, pictures and facts and messages included the hashtag #MyTime. A video contest was also prepared on Vine, where participants had to submit a video that finished the sentence: \"I received the HPV vaccine so that I have time to ...\" Uptake of HPV vaccination : Despite widespread coverage in the media, the messaging does not seem to have effectively changed behaviour given the limited knowledge seen in focus groups. Among participants, 63% had heard of the campaign. Following the campaign, 93% had heard of the HPV vaccine and 74% believed the HPV vaccine was successful at preventing cervical cancer. Online group discussions Kimmerle 2014[150] Examine in what way the particular type of contribution (i.e. factual information vs personal experiences) has an impact on the subsequent communication in health -related Internet f orums. Social media type : Internet Forum Vaccine : Measles Country : Germany (although unclear whether the forums are German) Target population : The users of 28 various Internet forums This study compared the differences between using factual information versus personal experience in a post on health- related Internet forums. The researchers observed how each condition of the initial post affected subsequent communication on the forum. They considered the number of responses each post received and how emotional the language/content of the posts were. There was no statistically significant increase in the number of responses on the personal experience posts as compared to the factual post. However, responses to the personal experience post were significantly more emotional than responses to the factual information post.

Target population : 1,200 female students (15 -17) screening and HPV vaccination and cervical cancer prevention The lecturer, a nursing teacher, initiated the discussion with the question: What is an HPV vaccine? This was followed by a brief introduction of the HPV vaccine and the CCPE lecture commenced. The lecture concluded with a brief summary and discussion, reflecting on the importance of cervical cancer prevention. Six -hour discussion sessions were offered either with Facebook -assisted or in -person dis cussions after class. two weeks after the Facebook teachi ng method) and 1.847 (measured eight weeks after the Facebook teaching method) times more likely to have the intention to be vaccinated compared with students who received traditional teaching instruction. Under the condition of receiving the vaccine free of charge, this figure was 2.531 times higher. A comparison of change across groups indicates that knowledge improvement scores in the experimental group were 2.942 points greater than those in the control group. Attitude improvement scores in the experimental group were 3.888 points greater than those in the control group. Under the condition of the vaccine being an out- of-pocket expense, the experimental group's improvement scores were 2.284 times greater than those in the control group. Langley 2015[149] Develop kno wledge about whether and which interventions can be used online to actively support offline vaccination behaviour once negative information has been spread via online social media. Social media type : Online discussion forums Vaccine : HPV Country : Netherlan ds Target population : 184 parents of daughters who would be invited to get their HPV vaccination Parents took part in discussion forums, where they were exposed to the following conditions: Participants randomly assigned to the conditions of a 2 (source pe er vs governmental organisation) x4 (influence strategy: source credibility, self -belief, direct challenge, indirect challenge) between -subjects design. Online discussion group to discuss raising adolescents and related issues. Parents were asked to log in on a specified date and time and to be available to participate in the experiment for 50 minutes. Some messages were sent by the study team to look like they came from peers or government officials and w ere followed by a pro-vaccination comment with different persuasion strategies. Personal attitude and behavioural intention: The manipulation of peer vs government spokesperson shows no direct relationship to the participants' intention or valence with respec t to the vaccination. The influence of the different cues to action is negligible. Other parents online had similar influence to that of friends and offline peers whom the respondents know well. Opinions relating to the vaccination within the nuclear fami ly have the strongest relationships, suggesting that influences via social media may need to concentrate not just on one decision- maker but on members of the nuclear family. No effect of the experimental manipulations of the different cues to action on vac cination decision. Interactive websites Daley 2018 [151] Test the impact of a website with a social media component on vaccine attitudes and beliefs. Social media type : Website with built-in interactive component Vaccine : Non-specific Country : United States Target population : 1,052 parents (during pregnancy and early childhood). Internet -based platform with vaccine information and interactive social media components 3 arms: 1 - vaccine social media (VSM) arm, access to website with vaccine information and in teractive social media components; 2 Vaccine information (VI) arm (website without social media), and 3 - usual care (UC) arm To reflect how a Web -based resource would be used in practice, individuals in the VSM and VI arms were given access to the Web site but were not required to visit it. Social media format: blog, discussion forum, chat room. New blogs posts added by the research team every month covering timely or controversial issues such as new vaccine safety research, recent vaccine- preventable dise ase outbreaks, changes in policies (either text or audio). Ask a question portal available as well to direct questions to experts (vaccine safety researcher, paediatric infectious diseases specialist, general paediatrician, risk communication specialist) - responses provided within 2 days. Online chat sessions held each month to engage in conversations with vaccine experts and between participants. Monthly newsletters to encourage website use. Among 542 participants in the VSM study arm, 189 (35%) visited the study website at least once, with a mean of 1.9 visits (SD = 1.8) and a range of one to 15 visits. Personal attitude and behavioural intention: Interventions were associated with significant improvements in attitudes regarding vaccination benefits co mpared to usual care among vaccine -hesitant parents. Interventions were associated with significant reductions in parental concerns about vaccination risks compared to usual care among hesitant parents. Perceived self -efficacy also improved, although a s ignificant change was only observed when comparing VI. No significant differences were observed when comparing the VSM versus VI study arms. Change in attitudes over time among parents who were not vaccine hesitant at baseline: The VSM and VI interventions were not associated with any significant changes in vaccine -related attitudes compared to usual care.

Infants in the VSM arm had a lower mean rank for days undervaccinated than infants in the UC arm (p=.02). Mean ranks did not differ significantly between the VI and UC arms or the VSM and VI arms. The proportion of infants up -to-date at the end of follow -up were 92.5, 91.3, and 86.6 for the VSM, VI, and UC arms, respectively. Infants in the VSM arm were more likely to be up -to-date at age 200 days than infants in the UC arm (OR 1.92; 95% CI, 1.07- 3.47). Up -to-date status did not differ significantly between the VI and UC arms or the VSM and VI arms. For the MMR sub analysis, there were 71% of infants with at least 489 days of continuous follow -up. The proportion of infants who received MMR by the end of follow -up were 95.6, 95.5, and 91.8 for the VSM, VI, and UC arms, respectively. Although none of the study arm comparisons were statis tically significant, infants in the VSM and VI arms were 2 times more likely to have received MMR than infants in the UC arm. Ferro 2014 [153] Evaluate the activity of the Societa Italiana di Igiene's web project to address misinformation online regarding vaccination. Social media type : Website with built-in interactive component Vaccine : Non-specific Country : Italy Target population : Online users The Societa Italiana di Igiene (Italian Society of Hygiene) created a web project to address misinformation online regarding vaccination, particularly among healthcare professionals. This compri ses of a series of information tools including scientific articles, educational information, video and multimedia presentations, a forum, a periodic letter and a Twitter account. A website (www.vaccinarsi.org) was developed specifically to counterbalance, with credible and proved information, the diffuse misinformation about vaccines online. The exhibition and structuring of the website contains a first level with easy, accessible information and a second level, exposing information with more depth. A third level comprises of user's direct interaction with the website. The website content comprises of multimedia presentations, informative videos, informational support and scientific articles. The website was visited 27.173 times. From those, 25% returned to the website. The average visit to the website is 10.000 hits per month. Most visits are from Italy, with 6000 visits from Milan and 5000 visits from Rome. Other than desktops, smartphones and tables are the most common devices to access the webpage. Differ ent sections of the website have different access rates, and the initial pages had 9000 hits, and page 'against misinformation' had 1460 visits. The website had, since the first month, a considerable number of visit and this can be due to Search Engine Opt imizer (SEO) and an advertising campaign online. The fact that the website remains as one of the first search results on Google means it is a very sought for website. The results from first month are encouraging and denote the importance of similar initiat ives. Shoup 2015 [154] Describe a process for designing, building, and evaluating a theory -driven social media intervention tool to help reduce parental concerns about vaccination. Social media type : Website with built-in interactive component Vaccine : Non-specific Country : United States Target population : 443 pregnant mothers and parents of children younger than 4 years The objective was to create a web -based tool that provides evidence- based informa tion in an interactive environment where parents can contribute content and discuss concerns with other parents and vaccine experts. To gauge interest from target population of parents, authors developed, pilot -tested, and mailed a survey to assess their h ypothetical trust in and use of a social media web -based tool for vaccine and health information. A manual medical record review was then conducted on the children to determine if parents had delayed or refused vaccination for personal, nonmedical reasons. Surveys were subsequently sent by mail to a random sample of parents who accepted vaccines (n = 500), all parents who delayed vaccines (n = 227), and all parents who refused vaccines (n = 127). Parents who delay vaccines, in particular, are the primary ta rget population for the intervention. Approximately 50% of parents in all three vaccine behaviour groups reported that they would use the web -based tool often. More than 60% of parents who delay or accept vaccines reported that they would trust the information about vaccines presented on the t ool. Regardless of their vaccine decisions, a high proportion of parents reported that they would use the tool to ask questions, to receive current vaccine information, and to review the childhood vaccination schedule. Approximately 50% of parents who dela y vaccines also said they would discuss their experiences and vaccine concerns using the web -based tool. In the sub -analysis comparing survey responders to non - responders, there were no significant differences in age, income, or home clinic. Overall, thes e results suggested that websites with built -in interactive components may represent an effective intervention tool to help parents make informed vaccination decisions for their children.
