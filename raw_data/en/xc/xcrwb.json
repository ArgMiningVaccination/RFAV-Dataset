VISION Reimagining health, education and discovery to create unparalleled value. VALUES Put People First | By being service-minded, respectful and embracing diversity Be Bold & Think Differently | By being innovative, courageous and solution-oriented Do the Right Thing | By being safety-focused and having integrity and accountabilityWelcome to the 2022 Jefferson Health - East Region Nursing Annual Report. As the COVID-19 pandemic's strength decreases, we are hopefully looking at the pandemic through our \"rear-view windows.\" It brings me joy to reflect on how we have weathered this storm and thrived. 2022 became the year of nursing stabilization - filling our open positions and retaining our excellent nursing staff. It was also the year to submit our American Nurses Credentialing Center's (ANCC) Magnet\u00ae document. In the midst of the pandemic, our nursing staff remained focused on nurse-sensitive quality and patient satisfaction. That focus resulted in our ability to submit our documents to ANCC. Our first Magnet designation was in 2018; we are seeking re-designation in 2023. The Magnet model is a program that ANCC uses to promote nursing excellence, innovation, and quality. The Magnet model comprises five primary - and mandatory - standards the ANCC uses to determine whether a facility can receive this prestigious status. They are: Transformational Leadership Structural Empowerment, Exemplary Professional Practice, New Knowledge, Innovation and Improvements and Empirical Outcomes. Why is Magnet status important? Magnet is the gold standard in recognizing Nursing Excellence and the multi-disciplinary teams that care for our patients. Magnet organizations retain nurses because they allow nurses to have a say in how they practice. Being a Magnet hospital means that there are strong relationships with peers and other inter-professional teams. Our Annual Report is filled with stories and evidence of nursing excellence. These stories are about YOU! The report highlights great nursing initiatives and the high level of engagement you have displayed in the midst of a pandemic. Thank you for another great year, and thank you for focusing on patient care while caring for yourself and your colleagues. Sincerely, Helene M. Burns, DNP, RN, NEA-BC Regional Senior Vice President & Chief Nursing OfficerA Message from the Chief Nursing Officer Jefferson Health-New Jersey | 2022 Nursing Annual Report 3Jefferson Health-New Jersey | 2022 Nursing Annual Report 5 Dear Jefferson Nurses and Patient Care Teams, As the world resettles from the latest phase of the pandemic, hospitals and health systems have faced significant challenges including staffing, employee wellbeing, financial health and recovery. I have witnessed firsthand what the Jefferson nursing community can accomplish, and I am confident that we will overcome these challenges together as we focus on these areas moving forward. Amidst these difficulties, I'd like to take a moment to recognize some accomplishments. In January, we launched the first ever system-wide Nursing Professional Governance structure. The model has four councils, three of which are chaired by clinical nurses and have majority clinical nurse representation. The fourth is a leader council that includes nurse managers and directors from across the system. We have enhanced key parts of our nursing workforce optimization by expanding the Jefferson Health flexible RN \"S.E.A.L.\" team, launching the Virtual Nurse and Nurse Emeritus (retired RN corps) Programs to support key clinical needs including new nurse transition. We continue strong partnership with the Jefferson College of Nursing and other academic partners to assure a strong future nursing workforce and opportunities to grow and further develop our existing nursing teams. In September, Joe Cacchione, MD joined us as our new enterprise CEO. In his first several weeks, Joe joined me and other leaders to kick off the annual ANCC Magnet Conference, held here in Philadelphia. Ten thousand nurses joined us to learn and celebrate excellence in professional nursing practice. One of the key highlights of the conference was getting to meet Ernest Grant, the immediate past president of the American Nurses Association. Dynamic changes will continue to be a part of our collective reality. This requires a strong culture and health work environment focus. Thank you for all that you continue to do for our patients, families and one another. As a community of nurses, you truly embody the characteristics of our Jefferson Health professional practice model through your expertise, integrity, advocacy and innovation. With kindness & gratitude, Kate FitzPatrick, DNP, RN, NEA-BC, FAAN Executive Vice President Connelly Foundation Chief Nurse Executive Officer Jefferson HealthA Message from the Chief Nurse Executive Officer The Magnet model is a program the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) uses to promote excellence, innovation and quality within the nursing field. The Magnet model comprises five primary standards the ANCC uses to determine whether a facility can receive Magnet status. Organizations seeking ANCC approval need all five elements present at their facility to achieve Magnet status. There are the five key elements of the Magnet model: Transformational Leadership, Structural Empowerment, Exemplary Professional Practice, New Knowledge, Innovation and Improvements and Empirical Outcomes. Why is Magnet Important? Magnet is the gold standard in the recognition of NURSING EXCELLENCE. It includes all of our nursing team - PCTs, EVS, Unit Secretaries and any other people who help us provide care to our patients. Magnet organizations retain nurses because they allow nurses to have a say in how they practice. Being a Magnet hospital means that there are really good relationships with peers and other inter-professional teams. Magnet Re-designation 2023 Magnet hospitals provide opportunities for professional growth - HOW? ~Council participation, such as Shared Governance ~Presenting projects/posters at conferences ~ Participating in the CAP ladder program, where you can be incentivized to be involved at work ~ Having a mentor assist you in your professional growth as a chair or co-chair of a council. Magnet nurses are more engaged and are subsequently HAPPIER and more satisfied with being a nurse. The Magnet visit will focus on clarifying, validating and amplifying all of the stories we wrote about in our application. These stories were about YOU! It highlights the great initiatives and the high level of engagement you displayed over the last 4 years! Magnet Conference 2022: More than 7,000 nurses and nursing executives from top hospitals celebrate Magnet Recognition and gathered to share evidence-based practices at the ANCC National Magnet Conference\u00ae. Jefferson Health New Jersey was well represented at this Jefferson Health-New Jersey | 2022 Nursing Annual Report 6year's annual conference. Magnet is the official annual conference of the prestigious Magnet Recognition Program and the conference serves as both a celebration of accomplishment for newly designated Magnet organizations and a showcase of best nursing practices for the Magnet community. Empirical outcomes are measured by data which validates the processes put in place to improve outcomes. Despite the difficulties associated with the pandemic, our nurses successfully met the Magnet criteria for our National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI) outcomes for inpatient and ambulatory units, as well as our patient satisfaction data in inpatient and ambulatory units. Our performance is evaluated by comparing ourselves to appropriate national benchmarks. There were 4 inpatient indicators: Falls with injury Hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPI) stages 2 and above Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) There were 2 ambulatory indicators: Falls with injury Surgical Errors (Adverse outcomes of care: wrong site, side, patient, procedure, implant, or device)There were 4 inpatient satisfaction categories: Courtesy and Respect Care Coordination Patient Education Careful Listening There were 4 ambulatory satisfaction categories: Courtesy and Respect Responsiveness Patient Education Careful Listening Along with the measures above, the Jefferson Health - East Region met the Magnet standards for Nurse Satisfaction under the following 4 categories: Professional Development (Access) RN-to-RN Teamwork & Collaboration (RN-RN Interactions) Leadership Access & Responsiveness (Nurse Participation in Hospital Affairs) Adequacy of Resources & Staffing Jefferson Health-New Jersey | 2022 Nursing Annual Report 76 Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals | 2021 Nursing Annual Report TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP Examples of Transformational Leaders Heather Croce, BSN, Clinical Coordinator, 3W Stratford \"You absolutely cannot mention '3-West' without mentioning Heather. This is a leader who leads even when she is not around. First, when you walk onto the unit you are immediately greeted with warmth. Second, she is always available to answer our questions. It can get extremely chaotic on the floor and as a new graduate nurse, we just don't have all the answers. When in doubt, just walk to the front of the unit, knock on the decorated door and give her a quick rundown and she will have an answer. Even when she is in a meeting, you can still get an answer! This action alone demonstrates that patient care always comes first with Heather. The best part about Heather is that you don't just get a straightforward answer. Instead, you get a 'therapist,' a 'patient advocate' and a 'timid bodyguard.' Yes, I said it, a timid bodyguard. The greatest part for me is that she encourages me to think in the right direction in terms of patient care and helps me to advocate for my patient. She questions me to make me redirect my thought process in a non-intimidating way where I feel comfortable and not vulnerable. By redirecting my thought process, I am able to critically think so I can meet Jefferson's core value of improving lives. Her leadership style is extremely important because it transcends downwards. We now have new nurses on the floor, and I try my best to engage with them the way Heather does with me. No matter what the situation is, I try my best to immediately stand by another nurse's side to help them and provide ideas that could improve the lives of the patient.\" Patrick Hughes, RN 3-W (Cohort 5 Nurse Residency Graduate). TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP Transformational Leadership: This refers to the ability to adjust to changing demands within the health care industry by updating an organization's behaviors, values and processes when necessary. Examples of Transformational Programs Jefferson Health Nursing & Jefferson College of Nursing Jointly Offer Senior Nursing Student Capstone Program The Capstone Program was a new enterprise initiative that included 486 senior nursing students being placed at one of Jefferson's 18 hospitals. Seventy-seven of the Jefferson College of Nursing students did their Capstone within the Jefferson Health - East Region. A Capstone is an intensive 3-week opportunity for a nursing student to pair with a clinical nurse and work the same hours side by side. Alternative Nursing Emergency Response Documentation We implemented an Alternative Nursing Emergency Response Documentation order set in early 2022 to help streamline Epic documentation during COVID surges. This was a temporary action that supported nurses during the COVID surges and helped reduce the burden of documentation.Jefferson Health-New Jersey | 2022 Nursing Annual Report 9said she saw an instant spark in me and she has continued to put me into different roles to help me grow professionally.\" Robyn Mahon, BSN, RN (Cherry Hill Story from the WT NICU Neonatal hypoglycemia is a common problem estimated to affect 15-30% of newborns. Of infants with hypoglycemia, approximately 10% require neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) management. Hypoglycemia is believed to be a natural phenomenon occurring in the hours after birth with little effect on overall infant wellbeing. In late 2018 and early 2019, Julia Burke, MSN, RNC-OB, C-EFM, Nursing Professional Development Specialist, noted that all term newborns exhibiting asymptomatic hypoglycemia were consistently being transferred out of the post-partum unit to the NICU for treatment. The Women's and Children's (WT LDRP) team (including nursing and physicians) applied an evidence-based protocol to positively impact quality outcomes and patient experience on their units. The protocol's objective was to help reduce unnecessary patient transfers to the NICU as they related to asymptomatic hypoglycemia; thus, resulting in a reduction in average length of stay (ALOS). Julia evaluated the current practices in the post-partum unit, identified Evidence- Based Practices, and helped to form a team of physicians and nurses to develop a new nurse-driven process using dextrose gel to treat newborns who present with asymptomatic hypoglycemia. During the post-intervention timeframe, the Women's and Children's department ALOS for term newborns experiencing asymptomatic hypoglycemia averaged 3.3 days. This represents a 30% reduction and a successful project.TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP Donna Cybulski, MSN, CCRN \"Donna epitomizes a transformational leader. She inspires her staff daily by trusting and believing in them. From the day she became our new manager, the energy and excitement she brought was beyond anything I can explain. She joined us in the midst of COVID and stuck with us the entire way. She has worked side by side with us delivering patient care. When we were short staffed and full of very ill ICU patients, Donna did not hesitate to work night shift and take an assignment. When we were all in a dark place from the stress of the new virus, she was the light that got us through the day. Donna has inspired her staff to step out of their comfort zones and supports them with anything they need. Our team strives for excellence every day. The Cherry Hill C3 floor encompasses Jefferson's Mission, Vision, and Values in every encounter. Donna inspires the TEAM to live the professional practice model (PPM) and reminds us how we enact these behaviors day to day without even recognizing it. This is all because Donna empowers us to make the right choices and to always put the patient first. She also knows the strengths of each staff member. She knows who can be put into certain situations and she trusts us to do the job. She has personally helped me grow as a nurse. I started on the IMC end of C3 and transitioned into the ICU. From the moment I trained, Donna Jefferson Health-New Jersey | 2022 Nursing Annual Report 10STRUCTURAL EMPOWERMENTStructural Empowerment: Encompasses organizational structure, personnel policies and programs, professional development, community outreach, recognition and promotion of a positive nursing image. It includes our Professional Governance Structure which promotes shared decision-making between the bedside nurses and nurse leaders, leading to the best clinical outcomes for our patients Recognition as Part of Our Culture Recognition should be part of every unit's culture. It shows staff that their achievements and efforts are valued and is a fundamental human need and an essential prerequisite to personal and professional development. Meaningful recognition involves genuinely acknowledging what a person did and how their actions made a difference in the lives of others. Don't ever underestimate the power recognition holds on staff retention and engagement! Outcomes associated from receiving meaningful recognition last longer and have deeper interpersonal impact on a recipient. Evidence supports that through recognition, we can elevate one's perceptions of self-confidence and esteem, optimism, hope, and resilience. Employee recognition is key to building a high-performing community that embraces achievements in positive, visible ways. Stories of extraordinary nursing don't always involve the \"big stuff\" like saving a life. Instead, patient, family, and peer perceptions of extraordinary nursing often encompass what we nurses perceive as the \"little things.\" Visit Recognition and Gratitude under COVID-19 Guidance for some of these ways to recognize your peers. Safe Practice Council and Its Policy Review Retreat Standards and Administrative Manuals In June 2022, the Safe Practice Council devoted their Retreat to policy review/revision. Led by Council Chair Dawn Scott, BSN, RN, and Council Facilitator Gwen Heaney-Cutts, MSN, RN, the day began with a \"How To\" presentation that provided an overarching review of policy intricacies, such as examining content for accuracy, clinical responsibilities, and procedural steps/flow. The use of key words and explanations along with up-to-date references were also areas of focus. Co-led by clinical nurses and nursing professional development specialists, the Informatics)/Holly Curcio (CH NPDS), actively reviewed and revised policies. Using Elsevier Clinical Skills, the online procedure manual, as a tool allowed for several policies to be retired due to the content being the same. Subsequently, workgroups shared their progress and recommendation to the members present. The successful Retreat yielded a review of 21 Nursing policies.Helene Burns, DNP, RN, NEA-BC, Senior Vice President & Chief Nursing Officer, held a Workout this past year. Both nurse leaders and clinical nurses were asked to participate. As a result of the feedback from the clinical nurses, Recognition boxes were given to each leader. Included in the recognition box was a \"Recognition Preference\" form for team members to use. The information provided helped assist the manager in personalizing recognition. A daily huddle form was also distributed that included a spot for daily recognition discussions. Twenty-five Jefferson \"Thank You\" cards, a pen and meal tickets were also provided to each unit manager.

The award is given to nurses who have provided exceptional care and have made a significant impact on the lives of their patients and their families. The award was created by the family of J. Patrick Barnes, who died of complications of the autoimmune disease ITP. The Barnes family was inspired to create the award to recognize the nurses who had provided such compassionate care to Patrick during his illness. The acronym DAISY stands for Diseases Attacking the Immune System. The DAISY Award honors a registered nurse quarterly who exemplifies exceptional qualities and attributes that reflect the kind of professionalism and skills valued at Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals. Once a year, advanced practice nurses and nurse managers are also recognized with DAISY Awards. To acknowledge the importance of teamwork, Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals also offers the DAISY Team Award, created by our nursing team in 2012 and now an official award administered by the DAISY Foundation. This award recognizes the importance of collaboration by honoring the work of two or more people, led by a nurse, who identify and meet patients' and/or patients' family's needs by going above and beyond the traditional nursing role. The Daisy award is a way to recognize nurses who have made a positive impact on patients and families, and the critical role nurses play in the healthcare system. It also helps to create a culture of excellence and compassion in healthcare organizations.

Examples include, but are not limited to, mentoring a new nurse, helping hands on a nursing unit, assisting with an educational offering, assistance with admission, discharge, patient teaching, and mentoring new nurse leaders. Remember to Take Time to 'Take 5' Working in healthcare is not easy. The fast pace and long irregular hours can be stressful. Self-care is important for those who care for others. Please take advantage of the respite rooms - a tranquil space where staff can take a few minutes to refresh, regroup and reflect. Everyone should incorporate breaks into their workday.Jefferson Health-New Jersey | 2022 Nursing Annual Report 25Jefferson Health-New Jersey | 2022 Nursing Annual Report 26 The Jefferson Health S.E.A.L.

Seventy-seven students learned at Jefferson Health - East Region. This was an intensive three-week opportunity for a nursing student to pair with a clinical nurse. Thanks to all of our clinical preceptors! RN Clinical Skills Sessions - Back to the Basics 2022 Based off of the Nursing Clinical Needs Assessment, the RN Clinical Skills Session was born. The results gave the Professional Development Specialists an action plan to develop a skills session that would meet the needs of the clinical nurses. Headed up by Christine Savini, MSN, RN, CMSRN, CPPS, CNL, who supports Medical Surgical Telemetry nurses, Resource RNs and all Per Diem Nurses, a hands-on skills session was created. With the assistance of her professional development peers, these sessions were greatly received by our clinical nurses. The sessions were fun and interactive while still reinforcing skills. Using our PPM: Partnering with Patients and Families 1. Tent Cards Clinicians and healthcare staff work tirelessly to care for their patients in an increasingly complex and stressful environment. However, sometimes the structure of the system in which they work does not meet the needs of the patients. Effective communication is one of the foundations of good nursing care. In January 2022, Helene Burns, DNP, RN, NEA-BC, Senior Vice President & Chief Nursing Officer, received an email from the son of Patient X relaying some concerns regarding the care his mother received when she was a patient on MS1 WT. Helene and Nurse Manager Vibette Robles, MSN, RN, immediately reached out to speak to the son and Patient X. They both expressed frustration with feeling as though no staff had advocated for her in regards to the care she was being provided or the provision of information being shared with her about her medical condition. Their feedback was that, if needed, there was no information in the patient room that provided them with a method to contact leadership. A discussion was held on how to create a process for patients to have a method of contacting leadership when they have concerns about the nursing care they received. With input from Patient X, it was agreed on the idea of tent cards, which would be placed in each patient's room and include the unit supervisor's phone number as the immediate contact for the patient. Jefferson Health-New Jersey | 2022 Nursing Annual Report 32EXEMPLARY PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE 2. \"Ask Me Three\" Inter-professional Education - COPD Education on MS3 WT Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive condition causing both pulmonary and systemic consequences. Clinical practice guidelines recommend a multi-component approach for managing COPD, including oral and inhaled medication adherence. This is associated with reduced healthcare utilization and readmission rates for COPD patients. However, non-adherence to medication regimens poses a significant barrier to optimal management. Multiple devices, poor awareness and understanding of the nature of COPD, and confusion about prescribed medication regimes were identified as negatively influencing compliance with COPD medications. Alexandria Gleason, BSN, RN, clinical nurse MS3 WT, and Christopher Carey, BSN, RN, clinical nurse MS3 WT, worked with Leslie Beck, MSN, RN, NPD-BC, Nursing Professional Development Specialist, on creating an evidence-based project related to COPD patients. Alexandria and Christopher worked on educating their peers about the \"Ask Me Three\" tool. This tool was introduced to the patient along with the patient education booklet upon admission to the unit. When nurses reviewed the admission education and the plan of care associated with COPD, they were able to easily incorporate the \"Ask Me Three\" education tool into their admission discussions, as well as a review of the COPD booklet. The \"Ask Me Three\" tool included 3 questions: What is my main problem? Explanation by RN of what COPD is and types of COPD What do I need to do? Smoking cessation with an explanation of the two types of inhaled COPD medications (maintenance and rescue), including inhalers and nebulizers, and how to recognize triggers. Why is it important for me to do this? Stay healthy and avoid readmission. By the end of this project, MS3 WT had outcome results showing a 51.2% reduction in 30-day readmission rates for their COPD patents. Jefferson Health-New Jersey | 2022 Nursing Annual Report 33NEW KNOWLEDGE, INNOVATIONS & IMPROVEMENTS New Knowledge, Innovations & Improvements: Our organization promotes the application of evidence and the creation of new evidence to contribute to the science of nursing. Organizations with Magnet status need to use evidence-based practices and research when implementing clinical and operational processes. This ensures the nursing staff uses only the most appropriate and safest practices when working with patients and can help them obtain new knowledge in the field. Culture of Safety Initiative on CH C5 and B3/Falls and Falls with Injury Prevention Bundle Case Study from a patient on C5 who was sitting up in a chair on day shift for about 5 hours. The RN addressed the patient around 8:30 p.m. and left to get meds. Patient stood up and fell (unwitnessed) Chair alarm not hooked up to wall to alarm in hallway Led to a fall fracture of femur and wrist This is only one example of a patient who was hurt while under our care and supervision. With an increase in falls across the Jefferson Health - East Region, a new process had to be implemented. It was piloted under the guidance of Kristina Johnston, MSN, RN, CMSRN, NE-BC, nurse manager of C5, B3 and the room at Cherry Hill. Kristi implemented \"Roving Fall Rounds\" that focus on ensuring that all patient-specific fall interventions are continually in place. Rounds are done at bedside handoff with additional rounds at 12 p.m., 3 p.m., 12 a.m. and 3 a.m. Roving Fall Rounds include making sure the proper signage is displayed, yellow arm bands are on the patient, all alarms are correctly used, appropriate side rails are in place, the bed is in the lowest position, an AVA sitter is ordered if needed, non-skid footwear are on the patient, the room is clutter free, personal items are within reach of the patient and the TIPS tool is up to date. LOS Project With the support and leadership of Diane Juliano, DNP, MBA, RN, NEA-BC, FACHE, our practice for decreasing a patient's length of stay (LOS) has been adopted throughout the enterprise as a \"Best Practice.\" Throughout Jefferson Health, we have an opportunity to reduce a patient's LOS in the hospital, which is also referred to as \"excess days.\" By doing so, we can improve the care that we provide our patients, reduce costs to support fiscal responsibility, and reduce the workload for our staff. A foundational element for the reduction of a patient's LOS includes the Plan of Care (POC) Rounds. The purpose of daily POC Rounds is to provide a forum for care teams to proactively collaborate on the patient's care plan and mitigate barriers for patients. POC Rounds also facilitate clear communication across the care continuum for efficient patient progression. How can you help? Participate in the Plan of Care Rounds at your hospital. Have focused conversations about what the patient needs to progress their care and plan for a safe discharge. Escalate barriers to care and/or obstacles to discharge. Plan for the discharge. If the discharge will be on the weekend, start planning for it on Thursday so patients can really go home on the weekend. Document in the Epic Plan of Care Report, Clinical/Provider Milestones, and in Cerner, in a meaningful and valuable way with the purpose to communicate needed information about your patient. Help turn over the bed so that another patient can be admitted if that is their appropriate patient level of care.
