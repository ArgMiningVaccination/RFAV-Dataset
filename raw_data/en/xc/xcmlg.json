On one hand, the disease doesn't need to know your name or your life story - it appears all the same, without warning or sympathy. On the other hand, the [ cancer ](https://www.bannerhealth.com/healthcareblog/teach-me/wilms-tumor-causes-symptoms-diagnosis-and-treatment)is simultaneously personalized to your body. You may experience different or more severe side effects that others with the same disease or treatment may never experience. The job of a cancer specialist is to interpret and decipher these reactions and help manage them. \"Your experience with [cancer](https://www.bannerhealth.com/healthcareblog/teach-me/what-you-should-know-about-gallbladder-cancer) and [ treatment ](https://www.bannerhealth.com/services/cancer/cancer-type/anal-cancer/treatment-and-support)will have its own twists and turns,\" said [Donato Dumlao](https://doctors.bannerhealth.com/provider/Donato+Dumlao/451988), MD, a palliative medicine specialist at [Banner MD Anderson Cancer Center at Banner Gateway Medical Center](https://www.bannerhealth.com/locations/gilbert/banner-md-anderson-cancer-center-gilbert), in Gilbert, AZ. \"As part of the Supportive and Palliative Cancer Care team, our team plays a [key role](https://www.bannerhealth.com/services/cancer/programs-care/supportive-care) during the cancer journey.

It's important that you maintain regular, honest communication with your oncologist in order to manage your side effects effectively. Side Effects of Chemotherapy [Chemotherapy](https://www.mdanderson.org/treatment-options/chemotherapy.html) is a proven, time-tested procedure. By oral, or more often by [ intravenous (IV), administration](https://www.bannerhealth.com/healthcareblog/advise-me/how-you-can-get-a-good-nights-sleep-with-a-port), the patient is treated with a medication that targets cancerous growth with powerful drugs that kill and control the growth of cancer cells.

Using methods that can be focused down to a square inch of your body or smaller, radiation is used to eradicate cancerous growth. More than half of cancer patients will undergo some form of radiation treatment. The side effects of radiation therapy will depend on the area of the body you are targeting as well as the dosage you are prescribed. As with other treatments, most side effects will be acute, but could lead to some chronic issues.
