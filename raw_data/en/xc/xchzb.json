It is assumed that the existing health system will be leveraged, and only additional resources are included - defined as financial costs . Importantly, the costs of health worker salaries are excluded from the estimates . Total financial costs - including country, regional, and global level costs - amount to US$ 2.018 billion, equivalent to US$ 1.66 per dose supplied and US$ 3.70 per person vaccinated with two doses (after accounting for vaccine wastage). Technical assist ance and global and regional costs amount to 15% of total costs. In -country outreach and fixed site delivery comprises 57% of total cost s. In-country , up-front costs , such as cold chain installation and training, comprise 2 8% of the total. 2 Introduction Delivery of COVID -19 vaccine s will pose unique challenges due to the urgency of achieving population immunity , targeting of non-traditional population groups , and administration of novel vaccines . Information on costs of vaccine delivery is essential for effective planning , budgeting and fundraising for the vaccine pillar of the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator1. A multi -organizational working group was established in early September 2020 with the task of estimating the costs of delivering COVID -19 vaccine s in the 92 A dvance Market Commitment (AMC) countries. The first , rapid estimates generated by the group were disseminated at the end of September 2020 . This document describes upda ted cost estimates based on feedback received. The new estimates are based on more thorough approximations of unit costs for some of the cost categories and inclusion of global and regional activities a s well as technical assistance . The differences between the previous and the updated estimates are explained in section 4.6. The most important explanation for higher total costs compared to the previous estimates is an increase in the number of doses expected to be delivered in the 92 AMC economies during 2021 . The cost estimates have been developed to facilitate planning , budgeting and fundraising at global level . Costs of COVID -19 vaccine delivery vary between countries due to price differences, diverse health system structures and divergent vaccine delivery strategies. The costs per dose estimates in this document are broad , benchmark values, which should not be u sed for detailed planning and budgeting in individual countries . A COVID -19 vaccine introduction and deployment costing tool has been developed for planning and budgeting within countries2. 1 https://www.who.int/initiatives/act -accelerator 2 COVID -19 vaccine introduction and deployment costing (CVIC): https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/10665337553 3 COVID -19 vaccination s cenario The aim was to estimate the incremental costs of delivering COVID -19 vaccine s to health care workers (HCWs) , elderly and other groups , amounting to up to 20% of the population in the 92 AMC countries. Delivery costs are defined as costs associated with administering the vaccine exclusive of vaccine supplies3. In our analysis, syringe s and safety boxes were also excluded , as these will be bundled with COVID -19 vaccine s. The costs estimated represent the additional health sector expenses needed for vaccine deliver y when existing health system s components are leveraged , and c osts are valued in financial terms. The viewpoint is the public health sector . Hence, resources already in place in the health system, such as health worker salaries, are not included . Costs of hiring additional health workers are not included either. Capital costs are not annualized , but the full costs allocated to year 2021 . The estimates exclude costs of potential oversight and assurance of external funding, which may be necessitated in countries with weaker delivery systems or in fragile settings . The scenario costed is summarized in Table 1. A vaccine that requires 2-8\u00b0 cold storage was assumed . The c osts of implementing ultra cold chain are not included, but have been estimated in a separate analysis for a relatively smal l target population , given that these vaccines will only comprise a small proportion of the overall COVAX facility portfolio of vaccines. A total of two billion vaccine doses have been secured for COVAX participating countries for delivery during 20214. Of these, 1,319 mill ion doses are expected to be allocated to the 92 AMC countries, including 50 million doses for a humanitarian buffer and 50 million doses for a contingency buffer. The remaining doses will be allocated to self -financing countries (Figure 1). Delivery of th e 100 million buffer doses are excluded from the cost analysis. Hence, costs of delivering a total of 1,219 billion vaccine doses to the 92 AMC countries are estimated.

The costs of deliver ing vaccines in low - and middle -income countries: Findings from a systematic review. Vaccine X. of 2 billion Covid -19 vaccine doses from COVAX It was assume d that countries w ill first prioritize vaccina tion of HCWs and subsequently the elderly, defined as people above 65 years . The subsequent target group was assumed to be people between 50 and 64 years , followed by the population less than 50 years of age . These are simplifying assumptions based broadly on the SAGE values allocation framework5. Preliminary insights from COVAX vaccine request forms show that w hile almost all countries list HCWs as the initial target population , 20 out of 82 countries subsequently prioritize groups such as the police , security force s or government officials over elderly and those with co -morbidities6. It was assumed that HCWs would be reached through fixed site delivery while the elderly would be reached via outreach services. As HCWs are already based at health facilities, fixed site delivery is considered the most sensible strategy for reaching this group . Outreach services was deemed the most feasible delivery strategy for reach ing the elderly because there will be no registration systems available in most settings to notify people about how to attend vaccination services . Coverage rates were assumed as 90% for HCWs and 80% for the other target groups. The number of core HCWs in each of the 92 countries were derived from the WHO National Health Workforce Accounts (NHWA)7. In this database, core HCWs consist of medical doct ors, nursing personnel, midwifery, dentists and pharmacists. The number of core HCWs in the 92 countries is around 14.9 million people , ranging from 0.25% of the population in Gavi eligible countries to 0.54% in non - Gavi eligible AMC countries . It should be noted that community health workers are not included 5 WHO SAGE values framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID -19 vaccination, 14 - eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y 6 Preliminary insights from COVAX vaccine request forms show that while almost all countries list HCWs as the initial target population, 20 out of 82 countries subsequently prioritized groups such as the police, security forces or government officials over elderly and those with co - morbidities (Source: Presentation to C OVAX Core Coordination Meeting (CCM) on 16th December 2020 7 https://apps.who.int/nhwaportal/Home/Welcome?ReturnUrl=%2Fnhwaportal%2FHome%2FIndex in the database, so the numbers of HCWs targeted for COVID -19 vaccination is likely an underestimate. This could lead to overestimation of costs because HCWs are likely less costly to vaccin ate than other population groups because they are easier to locate. The total population of the 92 economies is almost 4 billion people (Table 2). Table 2: Size of population groups in the 92 AMC economies (2021) Core HCWs People 65+ People 50 -64 years Population 100% 4 Assumptions and methods for cost estimates Costs of COVID -19 vaccine delivery for the 92 AMC countries were estimated at global, regional and country levels. While m ost costs will be incurred within countries during deployment preparations and for administering the vaccine , important activities are necessary at global and regional levels. Global and regional activities included were : Technical Assistance Innovations (smart vaccination certificates, traceability soluti ons, real -time monitoring, digital micro -planning, digital tools for safety monitoring ) Pharmacovigilance activities at regional and global levels Post-introduction evaluations 4.1 Country -level delivery costs A total of 1 3 cost categories were included for country -level delivery costs (Table 3). Syringes and safety boxes will be bundled with the COVID -19 vaccine s, so these were not included in the delivery cost estimates . Unit costs were scaled to total costs by either mult iplying by number of vaccine doses, number of health facilities in the respective country , or assuming total costs per country (Table 3 ). The number of health facilities per country were gathered from either the Global Health Observatory database8 or from Gavi applications for the Cold Chain Equipment Optimization Platform (CCEOP ). When comparing with local knowledge , it was apparent that both data source s seemed to underestimate the number of health facilities. We therefore used the source with the highest number of health facilities for a country . 8 Global Health Observatory indicator views, https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.imr Table 3: Cost s categories included in delivery cost estimates Cost category Scaling factor 1 Planning and coordination Country 2 Training Facility 3 Social mobilization Facility and country 4 Cold chain equipment (2 -8\u00b0) Dose 5 Cold chain recurrent Dose 6 Pharmacovigilance Facility and country 7 Vaccination certificates Dose 8 Protective Personal Equipment (PPE) for health care workers Dose 9 Hand hygiene for health care workers and vaccine recipients Facility and d ose 10 Vaccine transport Dose 11 Waste management Dose 12 Per diem for outreach service delivery and supervision Dose 13 Transportation for outreach service s Dose An important data source for unit costs was the Immunization Delivery Cost Catalogue (IDCC)9. This database stores resources on vaccine delivery costs in low- and middle -income countries (LMICs ) from a large , systematic review of published and unpublished studies available since 2005. Data from IDCC were complemented with information from vaccination campaign budgets and H uman Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine introduction budgets. Cold chain equipment costs were deriv ed from the PATH Installed Base and Forecast Model. All costs were inflated to 2020 values. Unit costs assumptions for each of the categories are seen in Table 4. Details of data sources and assumptions for each of the cost categories are included in Annex 1. As an example, transportation costs for outreach will decrease with the number of doses delivered in an outreach session. Since many data points were derived from studies and budgets campaigns targeting infants, where sometimes as many as 100-200 doses could be delivered on a given day, the number of doses delivered were adjusted to reflect the most likely number of doses administered when targeting health care workers and the elderly. It was assumed that 50 doses would be delivered per ses sion at fixed sites and 30 doses per outreach session. Fixed costs are defined as items that do not vary substantially by the number of doses delivered, such as planning and coordination. Variable costs vary with the number of vaccine doses delivered. Unit costs vary between countries because of different salary levels and prices of goods, while the costs of tradable goods, such as cold chain equipment, are generally relatively similar across countries. Unit costs related to non -tradeable items were adjust ed in the analysis as follows. Four cost categories were adjusted according to purchasing power parity (PPP): (i) training, (ii) vaccine transport, (iii) per diems and (iv) transportation for outreach. The methodology developed by Portnoy and colleagues fo r adjusting unit costs for PPP was used10. For social media listening, country -specific salaries were used to adjust the estimates. Country -specific water tariffs for costs of infection prevention and control were used. 9 http://immunizationeconomics.org/ican -idcc 10 Portnoy A, Vaughan K, C, Resch SC, Brenzel L, Menzies NA.

Estimates listed are median values across the data source s (details given in Annex 1) 4.2 Technical Assistance Due to the urgency and complexity of COVID -19 vaccine roll-out, substantial technical assistance (TA) will be required in all 92 AMC economies . TA will be provided by several different organizations, including WHO, UNICEF, USAID and Centers for Disease Control. Financing for TA is needed at global, regional and country levels. The 13 vaccine delivery c ost categories are closely interlinked, and TA is needed for all aspects of vaccine delivery . Planning and coordination should ensure that all activities and commodities are delivered coherent ly and in the right order. The vaccine can for instance not be administered until staff has been train ed and the cold chain is in place. For commodity cost c ategories, such as cold chain and PPE, TA is ne eded for installment and in -country logistics. Costs of TA was approximated as an additional percentage of delivery costs for each of the categories. Twenty percent of costs was assumed for activities that req uire updated or new systems and procedures : Planning and coordination, cold chain, training , social mobilization, pharmacovigi lance, vaccine transport , and waste management. Ten percent was assumed for categories that largely consist of recurrent commodities: Vaccination certificates, PPE, and hand hygiene. Five percent was assumed for costs that are largely transactional: C old chain recurrent, per diem and transportation for outreach. 4.3 Global and regional level costs 4.3.1 Pharmacovigilance Since all CO VID-19 vaccines are novel vaccines that have never been used in humans on a large scale, strong pharmacovigilance will be imperative. The WHO COVID -19 pharmacovigilance working group recommends that there should be a safety committee in each WHO region tha t meets frequently to assess all available data, both from routine safety surveillance and from studies. Members of these committees should be trained, and they should be paid for their time and expertise. The committees should be in place for at least one year after vaccine introduction. At global level, it is desirable that country representatives are engaged during the pre -qualification stage of the various COVID -19 vaccines. The aim is to transfer expertise in pharmacovigilance to stakeholders in LMICs. The approximate, annual costs for ensuring strong engagement in pharmacovigilance amount to US$ 2.4 million (Table 5).

Costs of implementing the innovations over the next three years were approximated by the respective COVAX innovation working groups. Total costs were estimate d at US$ 77.9 million , with US$ 33.6 needed in 2021.

A post-implementation evaluation taskforce with emphasis on LMICs has been established under the leadership of the WHO. The aim of the taskforce is to co -ordinate ongoing and planned evaluation activities and make linkages between focus areas. Approximate costs for the stud y topics represented in the taskforce are seen in Table 7. It is not recommended that all countries undertake safety studies, but at least one study should be undertaken in each WHO subregion. It is for instance necessary to e valuate the safety of using the vaccine in children and during pregnancy. For programmatic evaluations, it is expected that countries will conduct an early, rapid version of the post -introduction evaluation (PIE) that only addresses specific areas of conc ern (such as ultra cold chain or how to access certain target populations) and in addition also undertake a full PIE 6 - 12 months after introduction. Total costs of post introduction evaluations amou nt to approximately US$ 13.4 million.

This is equivalent to 8.52% of the population in India and 17% of the population in the remaining 91 economies. The population reached is less than 20% as targeted by COVAX due to the assumption of 10% vaccine wastage. Core HCWs comprise 2.5% of the population reached , people aged 65 years and older comprise 32%, and people between 50 and 64 years comprise 42% . The demographic composition determines whether there are doses left for vaccinating the population less than 50 years. The following 16 countries have a relatively old population compared to the other countries and will not have vaccin es left for vaccinating people less than 50 years: El Salvador, Fiji, Grenada, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Moldova, Morocco, Myanmar, North Korea , Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent, Sri Lanka , Tunisia, Ukraine and Vietnam . Table 8: Number of people predicted to be vaccinated with two doses of COVID -19 vaccine during 2021 (coverage) HCWs People 65+ People 50 -64 years Population d elivery costs Total , country -level costs of delivering 1, 219 million doses were estimate d at US$ 1.722 billion (Table 9). This is equivalent to US$ 1.41 per dose supplied and US$ 3.15 per person vaccinated with two doses (after accounting for wastage) . Upfront costs for activities and investments that need to be in place before vaccination can start total US$ 576 million . Three cost categories comprise 63% of total costs : per diem for outreach (3 3%), social mobilization (18%) and transportation for outreach (1 2%).

Table 11: Global and regional level costs (US$) Activity Costs in 2021 Total c osts (three years) Percent of Total costs Total financial costs - including country, regional, and global level costs - amount to US$ 2.018 billion, equivalent to US$ 1.6 6 per dose supplied and US$ 3. 70 per person vaccinated with two doses (Table 12) (after accounting for wastage) . The costs per dose supplied was calculated by dividing total costs with total number of doses supplied (1.219 billion doses). The costs per person vaccinated with two doses were estimated by dividing total costs by 546,281,265 people vaccinated . Hence, t he number of doses delivered are 1,092,562,529. The difference between doses supplied and doses delivered is explained by the assumed 10% vaccine wastage rate. Technical assista nce and g lobal and regional costs amount to 15% of total costs . In-country outreach and fixed site delivery comprise s 57% of total costs and in-country up-front costs comprise 28% of the total (Table 13 and Figure 3).

COVID -19 vaccine will however be delivered to different population groups and in different manners than the s tudies and budgets of which the approximations are based upon . Moreover, d elivery strategies are uncertain and expected to vary between countries. There are thus substantial uncertainties and the unit cost estimates should be viewed as broad approximation s with wide confidence intervals . To improve the evidence on costs , it will be important to gather data alongside vaccine introductions in countries represent ing different settings. Only financial costs have been estimated. This is especially a limitation regarding the costs of human resources because salary costs are not included. It is likely that counties will need to recruit additional staff to be able to adm inister the large volume of vaccines and these costs are not included. 5.7 Comparison with previous estimates In the preliminary analysis distributed at the end of September 2020, total costs were estimate d at US$ 1.5 billion for delivering 1,050 billion dose s, equiva lent to US$ 1.41 per dose delivered and US$ 3.02 per person vaccinated with two doses . The costs have now increased to US$ 2 billion. In the present, updated analysis, t he number of doses predicted to be delivered in 2021 has according to COVAX plans and predictions increased to 1,219 million doses . This increase drives the rise in the global cost estimate. Costs per dose in the update d analysis is US$ 1.6 6 compared to the previous US$ 1.41 per dose . The increase is explained by the inclusi on of regional and global costs in the form of technical assistance, innovations, pharmacovigilance and post -delivery evaluations. The costs per dose of in -country delivery has not changed - it remained at US$ 1.41 per dose despite changes in data and assumptions. Annex 1: Assumptions and data sources for country -level delivery cost categor ies A. Planning and coordination Given the higher expected costs of COVID -19 vaccine introduction compared to previous new vaccine introductions, we relied on planning and coordination costs from an analysis of Gavi Technical Assistance for national HPV vaccine introduction in seven count ries during 2019: Solomon Islands , and Zambia. Specifically, we assumed the median value across these seven countries as the default assumption, and the maximum value across the seven countries as the assu mption for countries with a population size greater than 10 million or with major conflict zones. AMC countries with a population size less than 10 million categorized with major conflict zones are Central African Republic, Eritrea, Guinea -Bissau and West Bank and Gaza (Table A4) . Table A 4: Planning and co -ordination costs for COVID -19 vaccine introduction Activity Default per country >10 million people or c onflict country Planning & coordination US$ 590,000 US$ 800,000 B. Training Due to the pandemic, health worker training in preparation for COVID -19 vaccine introduction is expected to partly rely on virtual methods. The WHO has prepared a comprehensive curriculum with training materials that can be delivered either online or by an instructor as part of in -person training. If training is delivered in person, numbers may have to be restricted to ensure social distancing. Virtual training is likely less expensive than in -person training since health workers do not have to travel to the traini ng venue, and there are no expenses for rental of conference rooms, refreshments, etc. Costs of virtual training mainly consist of establish ing online system s at the national level and ensuring that health workers have access to computers and/or smart phon es. However, national coordination costs may increase. Since there is not yet any data available on methods used for health worker training, w e based costs on previous new vaccine introduction s even though these were solely using in-person training. This could be an over -estimate of training costs for COVID -19 vaccine. However, since the vaccine will target a new population group and since introduction needs to take place at unprecedented speed, training of staff is an essential activity and it is imperati ve that the budget is adequate . The estimates will be updated when more information on training modalities and its costs become available. Cost data were gathered from vaccination campaign s and new vaccine introduction budgets (Table A5). Example budget i tems were per diem, transport, refreshments, and venue rentals. The costs of training were converted from national (or subnational) amounts to per facility estimates, assuming that training costs would scale with the number of facilities in a given country . The number of health facilities per country was derived from the Global Health Observatory or taken from the respective article. The cost per facility ranged from US$0. 49 based on a new vaccine introduction study in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to US$ 4,640 per facility in Solomon Islands. No correlation could be identified between cost and size of the country, the size of the campaign, type of vaccine or region. Therefore, a crude median across all available data was used, reducing the impact of outliers an d resulting in a median of US$ 63 per health facility. This value was used as a scaling factor for extrapolation of existing data to all 92 countries. The costs include training at all levels; not just in health facilities.

Social mobilization The costs of social mobilization activities include three components: 1. Behavioral and social data collection 2. Social listening 3. Social mobilization activities associated with prior 'new vaccine introductions' As components (1) and (2) were not costed in prior analyses of new vaccine introductions, we gathered information from experts at WHO, UNICEF, BMGF , Common Thread and Johns Hopkins University . For behavioral and social data collection, the WHO recommends a sample size of 400 people for the immunization survey instrument that is currently being pilot tested at a likely cost of US$ 80 per interview. Hence, we assumed a cost of U S$ 30,000 per country on average as the default assumption. For countries with a population size greater than 10 million or with major conflict zones, we assumed a cost of $100,000, as either a larger sample size or higher cost per interview would be expec ted. Countries with a population size less than 10 million categorized with major conflict zones are Central African Republic , Eritrea , Guinea -Bissau and West Bank and Gaza. For social listening, following consultation with the Johns Hopkins Center for Com munication Programs, we assumed that one monitoring and evaluation (M&E) level officer would be required to monitor social media , off line media, data from helplines and other community feedback mechanism, analy ze data and produce reports, which would syst ematically feed into the programme to inform communication strategies, advocacy agenda and programme response . Two M&E level officers were assumed required in countries with a population size greater than ten million or with major conflict zones . Health care worker wages were estimated as multiples of GDP using estimation from a paper by Serie et al14 that reports salaries for three groups ; medical doctors, n urses and midwives, and other health care workers. W e used an average of the multiple for the latter two groups. Social mobilization for supporting new vaccine introduction include social mapping at community level to identif y priority population to be vaccinated, influencers, and their profiles; production and dissemination of message content, mass media and print material; community engagement activities , such as dialogue at community level, interpersonal communication at household level through social mobilisers and CSO engagement, mobilization of youth g roups, men and women group, community based organization and religious leaders . This also includes capacity building of frontline workers on social and behavior change communication and costs for monitoring and supervision of communication and community en gagement activities. We utilized estimates from the Immunization Delivery Cost Catalogue11,12,13 and Gavi's analysis on technical assistance for seven countries introducing HPV vaccine in 2019: Solomon Islands , and Zambia . We doubled the costs of mass media dissemination (TV/radio ads) and community advocacy/sensitization as recommended by the COVID -19 vaccine Social Mobilization working group. We assumed that these costs scaled 11 Ngabo F, et al. (2015). A cost comparison of introducing and delivering pneumococcal, rotavirus and human papillomavirus vaccines in Rwanda.

Cold chain equipment The PATH Installed Base and Forecast model includes country -specific data on spare capacity in national, regional and district cold stores as well as in health facilities. Capacity is measured in liters. The data on cold chain capacity has been gathered from Gavi CCEOP applications and from WHO/UNICEF databases. Data from district cold stores or health facilities are available from 48 countries (predominantly Gavi -eligible) while national and regional level storage capacity data are only available from 35 and 36 countries, respectively. Capa city data from the Gavi eligible countries show that the biggest needs are at national and regional levels. Due to recent CCEOP investments, most Gavi eligible countries have enough spare capacity in district cold stores and in health facilities. Capacity data from non-Gavi eligible AMC countries is more limited, particularly at the district and health facility levels. For countries where capacity data is a vailable, cold chain costs are estimated based on the difference between existing capacity and required capacity. For Gavi eligible countries with no capacity data available and for the non -Gavi eligible AMC countries, it was assumed that there is no spare capacity at the national and regional level s, and therefore full expansion is needed to accommodate COVID -19 vaccine introduction. National and regional levels will be the main storage hubs for COVID -19 vaccines and so it was assumed that countries will need the full expansion of capacity at these lev els. We assumed that only a certain proportion of district level stores will be equipped with new cold chain equipment. This proportion is currently assumed to be 20%. We assume d that no countries need to add capacity at facility level in order to store COVID -19 vaccines. It was assumed that there should be a 25% reserve capacity in 2 -8\u00b0C refrigerators. Two ice pack freezers were assumed per region. For the 20% of districts with assumed expansion, we assumed one ice pack freezer per store. The types of equ ipment assumed to be purchased to ensure cold chain expansion is summarized in Table A7. Unit prices from the COVAX cold chain equipment application form was used. An average was taken across unit prices and service bundle costs for the different brands of equipment. 14 Serje J, Bertram MY, Brindley C, Lauer JA.

Cost Eff Resour Alloc. 2018 Mar 9;16:10 The need for cold chain expansion depends on the frequency of vaccine deliveries; the more annual deliveries, the less need for cold chain expansion. The annual number of shipments from vaccine manufacturer to country was assumed to be four. Similarly, fou r, annual deliveries were assumed from national to regional levels.

Pharmacovigilance surveillance The WHO has issued guidelines for establishing safety surveillance systems in countries using COVID -19 vaccines15. The minimum requirements for all countries are: a) All facilities must have an adverse event reporting form. This can either be a paper format or digital (costs of digital is included in the global/regional innovation costs) b) Training of f acility staff in adverse event assessment and reporting c) System to enable facilities to report adverse events to national level d) National database to capture adverse event data reported by facilities e) Continuous data entry into the national database f) Regular analysis of adverse event data g) Communication strategy for reacting to real and perceived adverse events h) Website for publishing data i) National AEFI committee Costs of establishing the system include recruitment of staff and training. Each country needs to have a core number of people responsible for pharmacovigilance. Training material that can be used by countries has been developed by WHO. A standard database format capturing adverse event reporting has also been developed by WHO and distributed to approximately 100 countries. The Roll Back Malaria Initiative recommended in 2008 that a national pharmacovigilance programme for anti -malarial drugs should cost between US$ 150,000 and US$ 250,000 for start - up with recurrent costs of around US$ 50,000 per year16,17. In 2019 USD, this amounts to around $205,500 to $3 42,600 for start -up and $ 68,500 in recurrent costs per year, which is the assumption we used for COVID -19 vaccine in each country .

On a per facility, the median for all seven countries analysed amounted to US$ 58.82 annually , which equal US$ 78.80 in 2019 values (Table A 8). For comparison, Table A 9 shows data extracted from IDCC and campaign budgets on AEFI management or surveillance as part of routine immunization services or vaccination campaigns. Over 50% of AEFI surveillance costs during the measles -rubella Sierra Leone campaign were incurred at district level, the vast majority of which were for per diems and travel allowances .

Vaccination certificates Unit costs of providing vaccination cards to beneficiaries were extracted from the sources listed in Table A 10. Each of the campaigns included incurred costs or budgeted for providing a record of vaccination (in the form of a small card) to beneficiaries or for children to show to their parents. In the Mozambique OCV campaign, a vaccination card was issued during the first round of immunization and had to be presented before receiving a dose in the second round. Prior to the OCV campaign in B angladesh, a census was conducted, and a bar -coded card was issued to eligible participants which was to be taken to the vaccination site. The median of all data points was US$ 0.03 per dose .

Personal protective equipment In areas with widespread community transmission of COVID -19, or in areas where transmission is not well known or surveillance systems are weak, the WHO recommends extended use of medical masks during vaccination shifts18,19. Masks should be replaced as soon as they become damp. The use of gloves is only recommended if the skin of the beneficiary is not intact, which is the same recommendation as in settings without community transmission. The cost of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers were estimated using the methodology by Moi and colleagues20. Data on session and vaccination team sizes were derived from immunization costing studies in Indonesia and Tanzania. In Indonesia, around 20 -30 children were usually covered in each outreach session by a team of 3 -4 staff. In Tanzania, the team size was similar, but the session size was generally larger (30 -40 children). Therefore, the sessio n size 18 WHO, UNICEF (2020).

For fixed sites, the session size was assumed 50 beneficiaries per session . Vaccination teams were assumed to consist of 5 staff. The following quantities of commodities were assumed: One mask per half day session (or two masks if the session took a full day) for each health worker on the vaccination team One biohazard waste bag per session (for used masks) Gloves not included . Unit prices were gathered from the Emergency Globa l Supplies Catalogue (COVID -19)21. The price of one medical mask was USD 0.3 1 and the price of one biohazard bag was USD 0.1 7. Cost of international shipment of the commodities were not included. Estimates of costs per dose delivered are seen in Table A 11.

Hand hygiene It is recommended that hand sanitizer and handwashing stations with soap and water are available for use by recipients and their companions at all vaccination sites, and that health workers perform hand hygiene between administering each vaccine. The following q uantities were assumed: 3 ml hand sanitizer before and after each vaccination for the beneficiary and the vaccinator each. Hence , a total of 12 ml of hand sanitizer per beneficiary. A simple hand washing station (2 x 60 L buckets with taps ) to bring to outreach sites. Buckets assumed to have a useful life of six months . Beneficiary and vaccinator would wash their hands both before and after vaccination (4 x each beneficiary). Volume of water required for each handwash 0.25 liters Quantity of soap a t outreach sites aligned with the assumptions for hand sanitizer at 12ml per beneficiary Water usage was calculated following the method by Tan -Torres Edejer et al22. Costs were differentiated between sites that have access to piped water and areas that do not. The proportion of health facilities with access to running water was extracted from the WHO UNICEF JMP database23. For areas without piped water, water needs to be transported to the sites. It was assumed that if a facility had access to piped water, the outreach sites they serve would also have access, and if a facility did not have access to piped water, neither would the outreach sites.

Sharp w aste management To minimize risk to the communities, each vaccination team should practi ce on -site waste segregation and implement reverse logistics, where health care waste is taken back to the facility by the vaccination team to be dispose d of properly along with other hazardous wastes27. Data on the c osts of sharp waste management was taken from a study by Griffiths et al published in 201128. Costs were inflated to 2020 values, giving a costs per dose of US$ 0. 044. K.

Per diem costs were extrac ted from data in the Immunization Delivery Cost Catalogue (IDCC) as well as campaign bud gets. The c ost per dose of per diems was considerably less during vaccination campaigns compared to outreach sessions due to the larger number of vaccinations given during campaigns . Outreach sessions in Indonesia and Tanzania generally reach around 20-40 children, while a large campaign can reach up to 200 children per day. To gather information on the size of outreach sessions, literature on vaccination programs targeting the elderly (mainly PCV and influenza) in LMICs were reviewed. However, very f ew countries deliver such vaccines through outreach services. For the few countries that did, no detailed information could be found on the session size. Given the limited supply , COVID -19 vaccines would need to be carefully distributed in a targeted mann er to reach elderly and vulnerable populations, and session size s would likely be relatively small. Campaigns usually target 100 -200 children per day, and cost data for these studies were adjusted to assume a reduced target of 30 persons per day. Table A15 shows unit cost s for each data source . The median of the data points from campaign budg ets, outreach services , and IDCC campaign costing studies (adjusted to outreach session size) was US$ 1.39 per dose.

Transportation for service delivery & supervision When conducting vaccination activities that are not within walking distance of the facility, travel expenses will be incurred. Costs related to travel for the delivery of a COVID -19 vaccine (transport, fuel and vehicle maintenance) were included in this cost category and full costs (e.g. the capital cost of vehicl es already owned by governments ) were excluded where possible . Unit costs for this category were extracted from sources as detailed in Table A 16. An analysis was conducted to adjust OPV campaign , campaign budget data and IDCC campaign costing study transport costs per dose for a reduced target of 30 persons per day . The median of the data points from the outreach services , campaign budgets and IDCC campaign costing studies (adjusted to outreach session size where required) was $0. 49 per do se.
