Apogee - clear and bright weather - generally not good planting time other than potatoes NOTES COMPOSTING Composting on a farm is of utmost importance. It is the very definition of \"renewable resource\" turning by -product or waste product into vitally important soil supporting material. Compost improves tilth, biological activity; it acts as a buf fer against over or under fertilization etc. in the soil. The return on investment of energy put towards the creation and maintenance of compost piles on the farm is one of the best available to farmers and gardeners. With a very basic understanding of t his living mass, any individual can be successful at composting and this can play a key component in the consistent improvement of soil conditions over the years. Learning Objectives The learner will: Understand the various roles of compost on a farm Have a basic understanding of the processes involved in decomposition Learn how to make a good compost pile and proper application methods Understand the definition and importance of quality \"tilth\" in soil Compost Compost is the action and end result of decomposing organic materials in their raw form turning into a vitally important soil amendment that improves the overall quality and tilth of soil Compost can be produced through the act of decomposing plant matter as well as decomposing animal manure Roles of Compost on a Farm Recycles waste material on site Adds large amounts of humus to soil Increases soil fertility and stabilizes elements such as nitrogen Hugely increases biological activity in soil Improves soil structure and ability to r etain water or create percolation of water through soil Creates outlet for potentially harmful excess of raw manure in animal based agriculture Compost is a wonderful example of alchemy, changing waste material into vitally important materials. Decomposit ion Two types of decomposition: Aerobic decomposition is the breakdown of raw materials in which oxygen is present. This is the type of decomposition that is relevant for composting. Anaerobic decomposition is the breakdown of raw materials in the absence of oxygen and can be identified by a distinct foul smell and a generally \"slimy\" feel. Organisms involved in aerobic decomposition Bacteria Breakdown of carbonaceous material Heat pile by CO2 respiration Actinomycetes bind aggregates in pile through fun gal like \"gray\" growth Fungi Performs more complex decomposition roles such as the breakdown of cellulose Binds free particulates together improving overall soil structure Breaks down woody particulates in compost pile Macro -organisms These organisms i nclude earthworms, beneficial nematodes, fermentation mites, and springtails. Most macro -organisms feed on earlier inhabitants of the compost pile. They're beneficial in their support of the food chain inside the compost pile. They produce castings, which contribute to the overall fertility of the soil. They aerate the compost mix, which introduces more oxygen, which in turn helps the pile finish faster and decompose more thoroughly. Components of a Good Compost Pile Carbon to nitrogen ratio is important to overall viability and health of pile. Initial ratio should be approximately 25:1 by weight. Moisture in pile should be equivalent to a moist sponge. A good rule of thumb should be the fist crumble test. One should be able to grab a fist full of compost and squeeze it into a ball that holds its form but crumbles under slight pressure. Dimensions of the pile are important. Optimal size is 6'x6'x6'. This creates conditions that are most manageable and appropriate for a hot compost pile. Optimal temperature should be between 130\u00b0F to 150\u00b0F. Anything over 150\u00b0F can begin to kill beneficial microbes. The compost pile should be covered in most conditions. This will prevent excess water from leaching out good nutrients and possibly having negative runoff. It will also retain moisture in times of no rain and excessive heat, cutting down on the need to introduce water to the pile. The compost pile should be turned regularly using one of many different available means. Turning the pile redistributes heat, biological activity, and moisture content. Turning a pile can finish compost up to 10 times faster than letting a pile sit unturned. Application of Compost Five to seven tons of compost per acre is a generally acceptable rate of application for field dispersal. Intensive garden situations can use up to 10 tons per acre. When developing a new garden or field, compost should be integrated into the top 18 inches of soil. For a developed field, compost integration should be no deeper than eight inches. Compost should b e applied in the spring prior to planting, midseason as an amendment side dress, and in fall prior to cover cropping. Glossary of definitions: Tilth: the state of aggregation of soil and its condition for supporting plant growth. (this refers to the gener al overall suitable nature of a soil's capacity to grow and sustain cultivated plant life) Humus: a brown or black complex variable material resulting from partial decomposition of plant or animal matter and forming the organic portion of soil Assessment/ Review Name several roles of compost on the farm. What types of organisms help the decomposition process? Why is it important to turn a compost pile on a regular basis? NOTES COVER CROPS Learning Objectives The learner will: Be introduced to various types of cover crops and their specific applications. Be able to identify various benefits of cover crop application. Why Use Cover Crops? The role of cover crops in organic farm ing systems: Cover crops are one of the primary fertility and soil management tools available to the organic farmer, and are an important strategy for preventing nutrient and soil loss from a field. They are crops grown primarily for soil or ecosystem impr ovement rather than cash and can provide a variety of services, from increased nitrogen (N) input, to soil protection, to weed and disease suppression. However, they can also have negative consequences if they are managed incorrectly or the wrong species a re chosen. Cover crop, green manure, and catch crop refer to different primary functions of the crops planted. Cover crop: Mainly used to prevent soil erosion by covering soil with living plants Green manure: Crop grown mainly to be turned under for soil i mprovement Catch crop: Used to \"catch\" nutrients left after harvest of a cash crop and prevent leaching These are not mutually exclusive functions. For example, a fall -planted cereal + legume crop that is incorporated the following spring can serve as a c over crop, green manure, and catch crop. However, different species and mixes may perform one function better than another. Perennial Cover Crops Perennial cover crops are most often planted in pastures and orchards. Often perennial cover crops require ir rigation. Perennial cover crops have multiple purposes and benefits. o Providing forage o Holding soil/preventing runoff and erosion o Retaining moisture in soil/drought tolerance o Fixing nutrients through root system o Preventing leaching of nutrients from runoff o Smothering weeds o Cycling nutrients up from subsoil o Penetrating hard subsoil o Improving soil structure Self-Seeding Annual Cover Crops Self-seeding annual cover crops are most often planted in fallow fields and in orchards. Often annual cover crops do not n eed to be irrigated. Annual cover crops have similar purposes and benefits as the list above. But the seed cycle makes it an ideal option for western climates with a dry summer. Green Manure Green manure is a term for an annual crop sown for the purpose of incorporating the back into the soil. The green manure crop can be fall, spring, or summer sown, and irrigated or not. Green manure has benefits similar to those of other cover crops, but when the crop is incorporated into the soil the following additio nal benefits are realized: o Trapping nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) in the soil that were fixed from atmosphere via root systems o Adding tons of carbon (organic matter) to the soil. This builds humus, a biological soil network that is the key to unlocking nutrients in the soil. (Addition of organic matter is also beneficial to soil structure, water holding capacity, air circulation, and friability.) How to Choose a Cover Crop a) Identify what you want the cover crop to do: Provide nitrogen Increase soil organic matter (SOM) and improve nutrient availability by increasing soil biological activity Scavenge nutrients left in the soil after the cash crop and prevent loss by leaching Prevent soil erosion Improve soil structure Improve drainage Protect water qu ality Provide mulch to conserve soil moisture Provide habitat for beneficial insects and spiders Suppress weeds Suppress soil borne pests and diseases b) Identify the cover crop planting niche Define timing of critical field operations for cash crop produ ction Winter cover crops Summer cover crops c) Select cover crop species or mix to meet the goals and requirements from steps 1 and 2 I. Examples - Field Activity Tour various cover crops, identify components (nutrient fixing plants, scaffold plants, carbon source plants), and dig holes to expose soil profile. Perennial - alfalfa, some clovers, rye, fescue, orchard grass, birdsfoot trefoil Self-seeding clovers, sub -clovers, medic, rye Green manure o Cold weather - peas, oats, fava beans, vetch (vulnerable at seedling below 20 F), rye, triticale o Warm weather - buckwheat, black -eyed peas, cow peas, sudan grass Assessment/Review What are the three basic types of cover crops? What are the specific benefits of each type of cover crop application? NOTES CROP ROTATION Learning Objectives The learner will: Understand various benefits of a system of crop rotation. Examine two popular rotational designs. Crop Rotation Overview Crop rotation is the practice of growing a wide variety of crops in a sequential system throughout the field with the intention of avoiding a buildup of disease and pests associated with mono -cropping. Crop rotation also promotes good soil health by alternating crops with different nutrient needs, therefore avoiding depletion of any on e necessary element present in the soil. Crop rotation can also benefit overall soil structure by alternating deep and shallow rooting plants, breaking up subsoil and reducing the effects of plow pan. The practice of crop rotation is ancient in its use, an d is widely recognized as a cornerstone of good agricultural practice. Importance of Legumes in Crop Rotation Legumes are plants in the family Fabaceae and are described as nitrogen fixing\" plants. Legumes collect nitrogen from the air and fix it on the root systems in the form of nodules. Legumes are a great crop to alternate with heavier feeding plants such as corn. The legumes return nitrogen to the soil after the plant is harvested or dies back. Legumes fix nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship w ith bacteria known as rhizobia that is naturally occurring in soil but often introduced in the form of an inoculant by the farmer planting the legume. Two types of legumes that are farmed are forages and grain. Common forages are: alfalfa, vetch, and clove rs. Common grains are: Beans, lentils and peas. Benefits of Crop Rotation Crop rotation can increase yields by15 -20% when compared to monoculture. Increases the overall biomass of the soil Improves weed suppression by maintaining better soil health and p roviding living leguminous mulches. Provides valuable fodder for livestock while enriching the soil. Popular Rotational Designs The Corn Belt system on large farms: Apply manure, grow corn, follow with soybeans, apply manure, grow corn, and follow with s everal plantings of alfalfa. In this rotation, legumes fix nitrogen in the soil before the heavy feeder crop (corn, in this example.) Specific plant pest cycles are interrupted. Specific plant disease is similarly suppressed. In this crop rotation, alfalfa cultivation also serves to smother weeds. Manure is applied before the heaviest feeder. Livestock feed is grown for use on farm or for sale. Intensive vegetable rotational system: This eight year rotational cycle can be adapted to many growing regions. Sw eet corn followed by tubers followed by squash, followed by root crops then beans followed by tomatoes, followed by peas then Brassicas. This style has been most recently made popular by Eliot Coleman and is benefited by the following relationships. o Potato es follow sweet corn...because research has shown corn to be one of the preceding crops that most benefit the yield of potatoes. o Sweet Corn follows the cabbage family because, in contrast to many other crops, corn shows no yield decline when following a crop of brassicas. Secondly, the cabbage family can be undersown to a leguminous green manure which, when turned under the following spring, provides the most ideal growing conditions for sweet corn. o The Cabbage Family follows peas because the pea crop is fini shed and the ground is cleared [early] allowing a vigorous green manure crop to be established. o Peas follow tomatoes because they need an early seedbed, and tomatoes can be undersown to a non -winter -hardy green manure crop that provides soil protection over winter with no decomposition and regrowth problems in the spring. o Tomatoes follow beans in the rotation because this places them 4 years away from their close cousin, the potato. o Beans follow root crops because they are not known to be subject to the detrimental effect that certain root crops such as carrots and beets may exert in the following year. o Root Crops follow squash (and potatoes) because those two are good cleaning\" crops (they can be kept weed -free relatively easily), thus there are fewer weeds to contend with in the root crops, which are among the most difficult to keep cleanly cultivated. Second, squash has been shown to be a beneficial preceding crop for roots. o Squash is grown after potatoes in order to have the two cleaning\" crops back to back prior to the root crops, thus reducing weed problems in the root crops Assessment/Review Why is it important to have a solid understanding of characteristics of specific crops and the relationships between specific crops in order to design an effective crop rotation system? What is the importance of legumes in a rotational cycle of planting? Besides general soil/plant health, what are some specific benefits to rotating crops? What are the three basic types of cover crops? What are the specific benefits o f each type of cover crop application? NOTES Community Supported Agriculture The term \"Community Supported Agriculture\", he reafter referred to as \" CSA\", refers to various types of arrangements that enable consumers to buy a portion of a farm or its crops for a given season. Payment for a s hare of the crop is done in advance, and the crop yield is delivered gradually, as harvested. CSAs started in Japan in 1965. Housewives concerned with pesticides and overly processed foods, made arrangements with local farmers to have access to purchase their crops directly. Learner Outcomes The learner will: Look at various models for co mmunity supported agriculture Understand benefits enjoyed by the consumer and producer Examine sp ecial considerations for success as a CSA Theory behind CSAs Participation in a CSA offers consume rs and producers certain personal, economic, ecological, and community benefits. Benefits to the Consumer Access to high quality, fresh food - health benefits are well documented. Food from a know n source is safer, assurance of good farm practices. Support sustainable agriculture \u00be Support genetic diversity - produce sold fresh and local does not have to be bred for storage and shipping charact eristics, can be br ed for flavo r and nutrition. \u00be Assurance of no geneti cally modified crops \u00be Assurance of organic growing methods - supports long term health of soils, farm systems, and ecosy stems that sustain o ur lives Consumer is able to build a relationshi p with farm and farmer. Connection and access to local food supply is a basic human right. Food dollars stay local. This strengthens the local economy, which is beneficial for several reasons: \u00be Fosters independence an d self -determination \u00be Promotes community co hesion and common vision \u00be Makes community more immune to crises, less affected by economic swings. Local food is not shipped long distances - enormous savings on fuel cost and environmental impact of shipping Benefits to the Farmer Crops can be pre-sold. Helps in maki ng economic and field plans for the year No middle man, farmers get better than wholesale price for crops Connection to community Provides a model that enables small farm s to co mpete in a market dominated by industrial agriculture. CSA Models and Methods Member /Farmer relationships: The details of the member/farmer relationship vary according to the specific CSA program. \u00be In some CS As, members buy land collec tively and hire a farmer to grow the crops. In this model, members split all costs and split the harvest. \u00be In other CS As, the farmer owns land , recruits members to buy portion of crops at a set share price for the up coming season. In this model, the farmer is in charge of a ll crops, distribution and fina nces. This is the most common CSA model in the U.S. \u00be Various hybrids of these two mode ls for organizing a CSA are also possible. Distribu tion \u00be Member h arvest Farm pick up \u00be Farm stand/market pick up \u00be In town pick up, often at member's home or business \u00be Home deliv ery Growing the crops \u00be Single farm - responsible for all crops. Organization and understanding of succession cropping is v ital. \u00be Cooperative - coordination of crops grown among several farms. Requires a farmer to act as coordinator. Advantage of crop specialization and reduced risk of crop failure. Setting the price and sizing the box \u00be CSAs that operate on member owned land establish share price based on one investor's fraction of the total cost of land, labor, and materials. \u00be CSAs that operate on farmer owned land can be \"produce driven.\" In this model, the share price reflects amou nt of produce supplied to a member. Price per share remains same regardless of number of members. The size of box is largely pre-determined. Th e member is paying for what produce they receive. What produce goes into the box is a function of what is being harvested, plus the total value of a box in a given week. \u00be CSAs that operate on farmer owned land can also be \"need driven.\" In this mod el, the share price is determined by dividing income that the farm needs for the season by th e number of members. The more members, the lower the share cost. Box size varies more; whatever is harvested on the farm goes into the box without much emphasis on the dollar value of any given box. Special considerations in growing for a CSA Variety \u00be Crop selection should be s easonally oriented. This assures that at least 8 crops are available on any given wee k, and insures variety in every box and over the course of the season. \u00be Spring/e arly summer - broccoli, cabba ge, cauliflower, kale, lettuce and salad greens, chard, green garlic or spring onions, radish, beets, carrots, spinach, Asian greens, peas, fava be ans, cherries, strawberries, etc. \u00be Mid-summer - above crops plus: summer squash, to matoes, peppers, eggplant, onions, garlic, lettuce and sa lad greens, basil, parsley, potatoes, berries, peaches, plums, green bean s, cucumber, corn, etc. \u00be Late summer and fall - above crops plus : winter squash, leeks, parsnips, melons, pumpkins, dry bean s, apples, pears, etc. Quantity \u00be Quantity is a n important consideration in order to assure that there is enough produce to go to all members. \u00be Plant prov en varieties that are a ppropriate for farm 's climate and environment \u00be Proper planning - plant more than enough for all members - consider planting extra to comp ensate for crop losses due to weather, pests, etc. \u00be Succession planting - required for stea dy supply of several crops. For example, to have a continuous supply of an important crop like lettuce over a 20-w eek period, the farmer must make several successive sowings. To do this, the farmer must understand th e role of light, soil temperature, ambient temperature, and all other e nvironmental factors in raising the crop. A lettuce crop seeded on March 1 may take 75 days to reach maturity, but a crop seeded J une 1 may only take 55 days. Member co nsiderations \u00be Membership goal - enough to meet fi nancial needs of farm, but not so many as to exceed farm's productive capacity \u00be Members' tastes - do they want stap le items or gourmet? Standard varieties or heirlooms? Impact on farm land \u00be Is the land able to support a variet y of crops without sacrificing soil fertility? \u00be Are crops grown appropria te for env ironment? Adding value \u00be Aside fro m the fresh produce, most people join a CSA because they also desire some sort of cl oser connection to the fa rmer and the land that supplies their food. \u00be Newsletters can provide regular updates on farm and CSA ne ws. A newsletter can include interviews with producers, articles on sustainable agriculture, etc \u00be Recipes can be included in produce b oxes. Recipes give suggestions on storing, preparing, and eati ng the wealth of produce. This can include ideas about how to use unfamiliar vegetables and new ideas for old standard s. \u00be CSAs sometimes o ffer \"farm days\" that allow members to visit the farm, meet the farmer and crew, see fields and crops, etc. Assessment/Review Describe the range of mo dels for CSA programs. What benefits of a CSA program appeal to you the most as a consumer? What benefits of a CSA program app eal to you the most as a producer? DIRECT SEEDING Learning Objectives The learner will: Gain a solid understanding of direct sowing, and in doing so create the best environment for seeds to thrive. What Crops Should Be Direct Sown and Why? Root nature of direct sown crops: often tap roote d Intended density of crop: Direct -sown crops require sowing at high density and eventual thinning Scale of production: Many crops are direct sown on a large scale to avoid additional production costs Exceptions: Many, if not all crops, including tap -roote d crops, may be transplanted if sown and transplanted in clusters Review Optimal Environmental Considerations for Seed Germination Soil Moisture Degree of secondary cultivation Soil temperature Preparation of bed Incorporation of green manure crop (discu ss) Subsoiling (discuss) Forming bed, addition and incorporation of amendments - activity/demonstration. Use tractor and rototiller. Discuss that seed size dictates fineness of soil needed to direct seed. Base amendments on needs of crop. Seeding Methods o Seeder - choose correct plate for seed, troubleshooting, gauging success o Hand - slower but more accurate, inappropriate for larger scale Determining depth of seed - rule of thumb Covering seed - with soil or sand - discuss pros and cons Subsequent Irriga tion - frequent and sufficient enough to ensure good germination - critical at seedling stage in hot weather. Thinning - when plants reach appropriate size, thin to desired spacing - based on desired size at harvest. Demonstrate/practice thinning. NOTES ENTOMOLOGY Learning Objectives The learner will: Gain a basic understanding of the balance of insects on the farm/garden (pests and beneficial insects.) Be able to identify a number of common pests and suggest methods of control. Be able to identify seve ral beneficial insects and discuss how they interact with crops and insect pests. Harmful Pests Corn Earworm Range: From the lower half of Canada stretching to the extreme southern latitudes of southern America Host plants: Mostly corn and tomatoes. Occa sionally found on some bean varieties. Appearance/Habits: Winters in soil as pupa. Brownish green moth emerges in spring. The moth then lays several thousand eggs on hosts. Several generations are possible in a season. Larvae burrow into cob through silk l eaving tunnel of excrement in path. Control: Planting marigold near corn is helpful. Mineral oil applied to browning silk at tip of ear is helpful. (one dropper per plant maximum) Squash Bugs Range: Common throughout the US from Central America to Canad a. Host Plants: Squash bugs attack all vining plants, congregating enthusiastically on squash and pumpkins. Appearance/Habits: Dark brown, sometimes light spotted brown. Hard shell. Three to four inches long. There are five nymph stages before the adults a ppear in eight weeks. Leaves eaten by squash bugs begin to wilt, blacken, and die. Smaller week plants may be have 40 percent die off rate. Control: Companion planting with radishes, nasturtiums and marigolds is beneficial. Striped/Spotted Cucumber Beetle Range: Native to United States and from Mexico to Canada. Host Plants: The striped cucumber beetle is a voracious pest of all the members of the cucurbit family. The spotted cucumber beetle is a much more general feeder effecting up to 250 different vegeta bles, flowers, weeds and grasses. Appearance/Habits: Striped cucumber beetle: Yellow beetle with three black stripes down back. Spotted cucumber beetle: Greenish yellow back with twelve pronounced black spots. Cucumber beetles affect the garden host plants in numerous harmful ways. They feed on all portions of the host. They can carry cucumber wilt as well as mosaic virus. Control: Protect transplanted starts with Remay. Straw mulch can slow spread of adults considerably. Predators of cucumber beetles inclu de braconid wasps, nematodes, and soldier beetles. Cabbage Worm Range: Imported worm/moth arrived on this continent in the late 1800's and can be found throughout the US. Host Plant: Specializes in members of the cabbage and mustard family but can als o be found in other brassicas and some lettuce. Appearance/Habits: Springtime when temperature becomes warm enough pupa hatch into white butterfly with three or four black spots on their wings. Butterflies lay yellow oval shaped eggs hatching into soft gre en caterpillars. Caterpillars eat large uneven holes in foliage. They feed for roughly three weeks and pupate. There can be as many as five generations in a season. Control: Companion plant with tomatoes, onion, garlic, and other alliums. Remay can be effective if used early on in the season. Encourage Braconid wasps by planting strawberries near possible host plants or around gardens. Aphids Range: There are many different species of aphids that can be found throughout the United States Host Plants: Ap hids can be found attacking and colonizing on an incredible number of plants. The real garden danger arrives in the form of communicable diseases the aphids can bring to your garden. Appearance/Habits: Aphids will come in a variety of colors ranging from g reen, brown, red, yellow, to black. They are generally a wingless soft -bodied insect that colonizes a garden when a few winged aphids land on a suitable host and quickly deposit a number of wingless young on the tender edible part of plants. The young feed on plant sap, maturing in about 10 days, and are ready to produce the next generation. This process repeats until plants become so stressed and weak that winged aphids are reproduced, fly off in search of a new host, and the process repeats. Effected plan ts decline in overall health until becoming very weak and covered in sticky aphid colonies until eventually die. Large aphid colonies in your gardens will also encourage an unwanted ant population as ants show up to \"farm\" aphids excretion as a food source . Protecting the aphid colony from natural predators. Control: Ladybugs and lacewings are the natural predators of aphids but the aphids breeding is so vigorous it generally can out compete the predators. Removing and destroying effected plants is importan t in control of the general population in your garden. Colorado Potato Beetle Range: The Colorado Potato Beetle is a native pest in the United States and began its destructive reign as the Great Plains east of the Rockies fell under heavy cultivation in the 20's. It has now spread to all parts of the USA east of the Rockies as well as some other isolated pockets. Host Plants: Potato plants are a favorite of these voracious larvae, but the CPB will enjoy a wide variety of plants in the nightshade family s uch as tomato, peppers, and eggplants. Appearance/Habits: Colorado Potato Beetles are large wide beetles growing to \u00bd \" in size. Adults are yellow and black striped hard shell beetles. They will lay an egg mass of yellowish orange eggs on the underside of the host foliage. After the hatch, a large deep red larva will emerge and can very easily skeletonize a plant in little time. Control: Aggressive hand picking of larvae is EXTREMELY important for control of spread as well as health of infested plants. Once larvae emerge and are established on plant a dusting of wheat germ will be ingested causing bloat resulting in death. Cutworm Range: There are many species of cutworms ranging throughout the majority of the USA. Host Plants: Cutworms will attack a wide variety of garden plants, and because of the great variety of cutworm species, each specie has a group of favorite hosts. Appearance/Habits: Cutworms generally appear as a plump caterpillar that can vary greatly in color. They can appear solid or variegat ed in color, often a greenish black with some stripes. When in moth form they generally are brownish black. They are often recognizable curled up around the base of plants laying in the soil. Cutworms can do severe damage to crops in a variety of ways: The y can chew through the stalk of a plant leaving the entire plant toppled from the base. They can climb, eating the fruits and stems, they can burrow, chewing on the root structure, and with Army cutworms they will chew the growth tip of plants before movin g on to the next available target. Control: By turning the soil over in the fall after intense cutworm pressure you can expose the larvae, or you can deeply bury any pupae. Thorough cultivation in the spring after the plants emerge and frequent cultivation s through out the season will expose cutworms to predators. Dig around base of plant destroyed by cutworm to find worms responsible. Planting sunflowers as a trap crop around the garden will attract cutworms and expose them for disposal. Wood ashes around the base of plants may be strong deterrent. Flea Beetle Range: Flea Beetles range throughout the United States. Host Plants: Flea Beetles will chose various host plants depending on what variety of beetle is present. Pressure on plants in the Brassicae family can become especially tough as spring turns to the hot summer of Oregon and weed host plants dry up and leave the irrigated garden plants extremely attractive to flea beetles. Appearance/Habits: Flea Beetles are generally very small shiny black hopp ing beetles that will jump for safety when approached by the farmer. Its this characteristic that makes Flea Beetles an extremely challenging garden pest to deal with. There plant damage is easily recognizable by the hundreds of small irregular holes chewe d through the foliage of weakened plants. It often looks like tiny shotgun peppering on the leaves. Control: Because of the challenge in catching and killing flea beetles without the use of pesticides, the organic farmer has the best opportunity to avoid h eavy infestation by applying a good regimen of diversification, crop rotation, and adequate watering. Under watered plants are more susceptible to heavy populations. There has been some effective control using bug vacuum systems. Early use of Remay may hel p the spread and heavy pressure. Beneficial and Predatory Allies Lady Beetle (Lady Bug) Prey/Habits: The Lady Bug feasts on many small soft -bodied insects such as aphids and spider mites. A single Lady Bug can consume up to 500 aphids a day. They often a re most valuable for the farmer or gardener when contained which is why they are often employed in a greenhouse type situation. The larvae of ladybugs are strictly predators, but the adults will sometime feed on pollens and nectars. They are not harmful to plants. Lady Beetles born in the summer time may only live a few weeks to a month however over wintering Lady Beetles can survive up to ten months. The Lady Beetles sold in stores are generally of the variety Hippodamia Convergens or the convergent Lady B ug. The problem with this variety is they have a tendency to flee the sight. Another drawback is that they are generally incapable of laying eggs. Appearance: The larvae are black and longer than the adults with speckled yellow or orange dots on there back . The adults are shiny and generally red with some black spotting on there back. Lacewings Prey: Lacewings feed primarily on caterpillars, small beetles, soft insects such as aphids, and some larvae. Both larvae and adults are predatory, and use t here modified jaws to suck the liquid inners out of their prey. Habits: Lacewings will mate and lay their eggs on any surface like windows, sides of homes etc. They will molt several times before spinning a silk cocoon and disappearing to pupate. They will emerge relatively quickly and can go through multiple generations in a season Appearance: Lacewings are generally a green -bodied long insect with two pairs of wings. Their wings are covered with a lacey veining pattern that is quite delicate. They have la rge compound eyes next to long antennae. Trichogamma Wasps Prey: Trichogamma Wasps are amazing predators as they parasitize other insects egg masses. They are known to attack over 150 different insect species such as cabbage loopers, hornworms, cutworm s, as well as many different moth larvae. Habits: Adult wasps seek out eggs following odor. The parent wasp then deposits her egg inside the host egg. Once the wasp hatches, it begins to consume the contents of the egg. The larva then pupates, and eventual ly chews out of the egg as adult and flies off to locate next host egg. Appearance: One of the smallest insects on the planet, they look just like larger wasps but are not much bigger than the head of a pin. Wasps have two pair of wings and the females are equipped with a stinger. This is used for probing possible host eggs. Praying Mantis Prey: The Mantis will eat just about anything that suits its appetite, feasting largely on any insects that happen by. They have been known to eat birds. The mantis wi ll either stay absolutely still and wait for its prey to walk by, or it will slowly and purposefully creep towards its prey. It will then strike out with its folded forelegs, grasping or even impaling its prey. These beneficial garden friends do not differ entiate between allies and pests in the garden. Habits: The mantis is a strange creature with stranger habits. When the mantis mates, the female will often kill the male in the throws of passion. The male can continue to have fruitful intercourse for sever al minutes after he loses his head. The mantis often sways back and forth when it moves possibly simulating the wind -influenced movements of the tree or foliage it's hiding on. Appearance: The mantis is a large insect, measuring from a centimeter being the smallest variety, to the largest being six inches. Most mantises are green or greenish/brown, however tropical mantis can be pink. They have swiveling heads that can turn a full 180 degrees, and their main defense against larger predators is their camoufl age. Some mantises have hollow bodies that they use as an echolocation chamber to \"hear\" bat frequencies and therefore avoid being eaten by hurling themselves to the ground. Tachinid Fly Prey: The tachinid fly will parasitize grasshoppers, beetles, larv ae, caterpillars etc. They will often take on large hosts such as the tomato hornworm. Some not all species are host specific, only preying on there chosen diet. Habits: The female tachinid fly will lay her eggs on the host insect skin, however sometimes t he eggs will be injected into the body of the host. The larvae then hatch and feed on host insect. Sometimes the host ingests the fly's eggs only to have the fly destroy the host upon hatching. Adults enjoy pollen and nectar as well, and can serve duel pur pose in the garden as pollinators. Appearance: This large fly often will be seen with a blue metallic abdomen. There are over 1400 North American species in the family Tachinidae. Adults have incredibly distinct bristles on the end of their abdomens. They are a similar size to the common housefly but can occasionally resemble bees. Soldier Beetle Prey: Soldier Beetles enjoy aphids, beetle larvae, caterpillars, moth larvae, and many other common pests. Adults and larvae soldier beetles are both predatory Habits: growing nectar rich flowers in the garden can attract some soldier beetles. Adult females lay their eggs in the soil, and larvae emerge shortly there after and begin to feed. Adults will often relax and wait by a good source of pollen, feeding on po llen and nectars until a good prey comes along. The adults will the take advantage of the prey insect that has landed to do the same. Appearance: Soldier Beetles, (a.k.a. leatherwings), get their name from the soft uniform like clothed appearance of their wings. They're about half an inch in length and generally have a yellow or reddish underbody with brown or black wings. Larvae are velvety in nature with large protrusions from their heads.

Purpose of maintaining farm records The practice is required by National Orga nic Practices for or ganic certification Records serve as documentation of th e farm's standards and practices Records aid future planning - (amounts pl anted, varieties pref erred, marketability of particular crop) Records enable comparison and tracking of farm's progress - (yields, soil fertility, crop rotations) Required Records Daily Log The daily log details any farm activity. It provides a basis fo r the year's master plan - (Details from daily log can be used to create a field map showing what crops were grown where. This is nece ssary for tracking crop rotations.)

Must include farm name and organic certification number, date, to whom sold, item sold, amount of item, price per unit, and total price Complaint Log If there is a complaint about the farm, this log records th e nature of that complaint and what action was taken by the farm. How to Keep Records With so many other important jobs to balance, farm record keeping is often overlooked. It must be added to the list of necessary farm chores. Ideally, records are kept daily during the main growing season (Mar-Oct), and weekly in the off-season (Nov-Feb). Different records should be kept in their own binders, in a safe and consistent place, with an easy to use form. It may work well to assign the job of recordkeeping to one person on the farm.

Gain exposure to common myths and underlying truths related to GMOs. History of GMOs Genetic modificati on refers to technology that makes it possible to manipulate the genes of living organisms to change the characteristics of that organism. Combining multiple genes from different living organisms is referred to as recombinant DNA technology. Resulting prod ucts are said to be transgenic or genetically engineered. First commercial GMO food crop was FlavrSavr tomatoes by Calgene released in 1992. FDA recognized the FlavrSavr as a food and therefore decreed it did not need to be labeled. Released in 1994, the t omato did poorly and was gone by 1997. Radically changed direction of GMOs GMOs Around the World Transgenic crops are now grown in 42 countries on 6 continents. Currently over 1 billion acres of land contain GMO crops. 2/3 of that acreage is in USA. Principal crops being herbicide/insecticide resistant soybeans, cotton, corn, and canola. 70% of products on grocery shelves in USA contain GMO ingredients. Over 125 crops are currently registered in biotech database. GMOs, WTO, USA, and the World The WTO (W orld Trade Organization) ruled the EU (European Union) broke trade rules with their de facto moratorium on the import and use of biotech products. Ban effectively denies access of US corn and corn products for sale in Europe. Case brought before WTO by USA , Canada, and Argentina. Controversies Surrounding Biotech Proponents claim less use of pesticide, however studies show that GMO crops are been sprayed with up to 5 times the herbicide and insecticide than used on traditional crops. Loose gene syndrome, GMO crops have accidentally cross -pollinated with non - engineered crops resulting in loss of control of patented genes. This has been referred to as \"loose gene syndrome.\" Companies such as Monsanto have sued small farmers over \"escaped\" genes when their ge nes have turned up in other crops. Genetic escapees are polluting the gene pool, rendering many non GMO crop seed sterile. The result is a major threat to natural genetic diversity that has developed over a long period and is fundamentally necessary to lon g term genetic viability. Terminator genes implanted in genetic make up make seed sterile after one generation therefore making it impossible for farmers to save seeds. Seed saving is one of the longest standing and most important practices in sustainable agriculture. Because GMO genes are patented it makes it illegal for farmers to save seed, or liable for lawsuits if GMO genes drift into their fields and plants. The USDA has shown no restraint in pushing biotech as they have reviewed 5000 requests for fie ld trials and not turned one down. Common GMO Myths Perpetuated by Industry GMO food will feed the hungry of the world . Truth: GMO foods destroy diversity, sustainable agriculture, and make developing countries dependent on receiving seed from USA every year, taking more money away from local farmers and local economies and sending profits overseas. GMOs are safe for our food source . Truth: The technology is so new that we have no way of understanding the radical long -term impacts of genetically altering living organisms. The public has been used as guinea pigs for a dangerous experiment. Doctors say problems such as allergies and other complications can and will take years to develop. GMO products reduce the need for chemicals on the farm . Truth: An overw helming number of GMO crops require the use of heavy chemicals such as the widely used Round -Up Ready line of crops produced by Monsanto. The company not only benefits from the seed profit, but from the worlds most widely used herbicide Round -Up manufactur ed by Monsanto. GMO foods can make products more nutritious, long lasting, and more appealing . Truth: The creation of GMO food products has nothing to do with food quality or ability to withstand shipping and distribution. Foods have been modified to withs tand heavy herbicidal spraying, or to produce their own insecticides. GMO products are just the logical next step in plant and organism breeding that has been happening since the beginning of agriculture . Truth: Genetic modification crosses genes that woul d never interact in nature, such as the crossing of spider genes with milk goats to produce large amounts of spider silk in goat milk to be used for body armor and industrial applications. Macro -organisms These organisms include earthworms, beneficial ne matodes, fermentation mites, and springtails. Most macro -organisms feed on earlier inhabitants of the compost pile. They're beneficial in their support of the food chain inside the compost pile. They produce castings, which contribute to the overall fertil ity of the soil. They aerate the compost mix, which introduces more oxygen, which in turn helps the pile finish faster and decompose more thoroughly. Assessment/Review What are GMOs and why are they a significant concern to the consumer and the small - scale organic farmer? What in your opinion is the most dangerous myth perpetuated by the biotech industry? NOTES GOAT HUSBANDRY/MILKING Goats are amazing animals; their ability to contribute to the functionality of a farm is outstanding. They provide an incredible food source in milk and meat potential, endless amounts of quality compostable manure, field and woodl ot management, and hours of hilarious entertainment and frustration. When deciding the role an animal system will play on any new farm, there are very important factors to take into consideration. These factors include but are not limited to: Infrastruc ture available or needed, the willingness of the farmer or rancher to devote large amounts of time to integrated animal systems, the desired output of the animals (food, manure etc.), and the long term responsibilities associated with care of livestock. E very farmer has a different relationship with herd care, and animal treatment. Often a good way of judging the quality of a developed animal system is to look at the amount of coercive behavior required by the farmer or rancher to get the animals to do th ere requested jobs, whether it be moving from pen to pasture or participating in the milking cycle. When a farmer or rancher has to deal with large amounts of frustration with animals it is always a failure of human system design, not livestock behavior. Learning Objectives The learner will: Understand the scope of general concerns involved in raising animals on the farm by learning some of the specific concerns related to goat husbandry. Be able to describe the basics of ruminant digestion. Review the pr ocess of gestation and birthing in goats. Learn and discuss the processes of raising kids and milking goats. Housing and Bedding Needs There are two basic types of housing: stalls in which the goats have individual pens and housing where all the goats hav e a communal living and bedding area. When selecting a style of housing, one must consider the welfare of the goats as well as preserving efficiency for the goat farmer. Shelter from wind Good ventilation Clean dry bedding Accessibility to clean water Contamination free feeders Shelter from precipitation Feeding and Nutrients Overview of ruminants Goats have four stomachs Large numbers of protozoa and digestive bacterium live in the rumen. Their job is to breakdown protein, starch, fats and cellulose thr ough a process of fermentation. Rumen occupies eighty percent of stomach space in a mature doe. Goats are browsers, and need to eat with head drawn in so food enters the slit in the esophagus and moves towards the rumen. Goats then regurgitate masticated f ood and chew their cud during times of rest. Proper feed rations Goats must have quality roughage such as alfalfa or grass hay. Concentrated grain rations are required for milking does due to heavy protein output. Proper mineral intake is extremely import ant for pregnant and lactating does. The proper feed ration for milking does ration should be sixteen to seventeen percent protein. Twelve percent protein is sufficient for a dry doe or a buck. Feed goats a minimum of one pound of grain ration for health m aintenance, and one - pound ration for each 2.5 pounds of milk. Make sure goats have free choice minerals at all times. Basic Needs and Feeding Systems Goats should never feed off the ground due to the risk of feed contamination with fecal worm load and unh ealthy coccidiosis load. Water should be clean and free of phytoplankton (algae caused by sunlight and organic matter) and zooplankton (algae caused by fecal contamination) Water kept slightly warmed will encourage increased consumption and therefore benef it overall health. Feed and feeders should be free of mold and mildew. This is very important. The Pregnant Doe Average gestation for a goat is 146 to 155 days. Goats can be bred when they are 60 to 75 percent of their adult body weight. Twins are the mo st common at around 65% of the time, but triplets and singles also occur regularly. Quads and quints are rare, but do occur. Signs of approaching birth: Goats should be checked regularly for signs of kidding 140 days from breeding. Signs include, hollow f lanks, discomfort, nervousness, widening of the space between the pin bones, and rapid filling of udder. Kidding 90% percent of goat births go unassisted Many different kid presentations are possible. The normal being front legs first with the nose restin g on the hoofs. Stages of kidding: Colorless discharge changing to thick and white when delivery is immanent. The goat may paw her bedding, lie down and get up restlessly. She will lie stretched out flat pushing with her hind legs against the floor or wal l. Water bag will appear and in most cases burst revealing legs and/or nose. Doe will generally rest at this point for a moment and then birth kid with several strong pushes. Following kids will be born at varying intervals with no exact time passing betwe en each birth. The afterbirth will be passed for each kid and a double afterbirth for identical twins. Post kidding First time fresheners often need assistance in helping their kids to stand and begin nursing. Kids sometimes need help cleaning the mucu s out of their nose and mouth. Kids should begin nursing within the first ten minutes. Kids born during cold spells should be dried and encouraged to drink as soon as possible. Dip umbilical cord in weak solution of Betadyne to prevent bacteria from travel ing up cord. Complications and remedies: If kid is stuck at the shoulders during birth and the goat is exhausted and not making progress pull down on hoofs away from birth canal. If kid is born listless and unresponsive a mixture of colostrum and strong b lack coffee may be given as well as a vitamin sucrose mixture. This may stimulate body heat and encourage nursing. It is important that the mixture be delivered to the stomach via tube so young kid does not aspirate and asphyxiate. Kids born during extrem e cold should be warmed up by the assistance of goat keeper. It is very important that all kids born are drinking colostrum within a few minutes of being born. Raising Kids There are many different ways to raise kids; your kid -raising program is dependen t on your end goal and style of management Kids should be fed their mother's colostrum for at least seven days. Separate the kids from their mothers after that first week. This will allow you to feed kids based on their individual needs therefore assuring consistent growth. The first week kids should be bottle -fed every six hours receiving four to eight ounces per feeding. The second week, twelve ounces eight hours apart. By the third week each kid can receive one quart of milk twice a day. These amounts ar e all dependent on the size and appetite of the kid, when the kids stomach is tight, the kids is full. The kids can have free choice of good hay and water once they are a month old. Kids should be weaned when they are two and a half to three times their bi rth weight. This generally occurs at around two months. Standard procedure for kids in a dairy herd: All males should be castrated as soon as possible or when testicles drop (usually around seven to ten days.) The easiest way is by use of the elastrato r, which applies a tight band around testicles and sack to cut off blood flow, and causes sack and testis to fall off. All kids in the dairy herd should be disbudded when appropriate. A dairy herd with horns will cause added expense and labor as adults due to accidental injury. Disbudding is done using a disbudding iron, when the nubs of horns become evident on the head. The disbudding iron is applied in a circular fashion around the nub until a distinct copper ring appears. Then the top of the nub is scrap ed off using a hot edge of the disbudding iron. It is important when disbudding for the first time that there is an experienced goat keeper at hand, due to the danger in applying the iron incorrectly. Disbudding can be done with one person and a disbudding box or with several people working together to immobilize the kid. Many goat keepers give their kids injections of essential trace nutrients and or vaccines just following birth but this should be done only after consulting your veterinarian. Milking Goat should be milked consistently at twelve -hour intervals. Variation of routine will result in loss of milk production. Milking equipment used can be as simple or complex as the dairy farmer chooses. The milking stand is a very important piece of equipme nt for farmer and doe. The milk stand must be comfortable for both human and goat and must provide feeding and confinement for doe. The milk receiving equipment can be a stainless steel pail or an automatic milking machine. Most farmers will begin with han d milking and graduate to a machine milking as needed. Proper stool height is essential to developing good milking posture for the farmer. Step by step milking procedure: Bring doe into the milking parlor from the loafing pen and secure in the milk stand . Provide food. Wash the udder with a warm water bath and then spray down using a weak iodine solution. Use a fresh towel for each goat. Dry udders and milk the first stream from each teat through strip cup. Strip cup identifies any abnormalities in milk that would be early signs of bad health such as mastitis. Completely milk goat out on both halves of udders taking special care that the udder is completely stripped of milk. Massage or stimulate udders to ensure thorough milking. Dip teats in dip cup to p revent bacteria from traveling up milk canal. Release and return goat to the herd. Milk Handling Good milk handling procedures are essential to producing a quality tasting, safe and healthy dairy product Strain milk through specially designed inline milk filters. Cool milk down to 35 degrees Fahrenheit within thirty to forty -five minutes of leaving the udder. Rinse milking equipment with cold water followed by warm water and an anti -bacterial alkaline soap. Air dry all equipment inverted on rack. Store al l equipment upside down. Diseases and Common Ailments of the Goat Bloat Symptoms - tightly inflated flanks, extreme discomfort, collapse and eventual death. Cause - Over eating of lush wet grass or clover, breaking into food bin, over eating of anything unsuitable or foreign. Remedies - Feed eight ounces of vegetable oil for adult or two ounces for kids. Massage flanks. Walk goats about continually until symptoms subside. CAE (caprine arthritis encephalitis) Symptoms - Swollen knees and joints and uneven development of one of the sides of the udder and loss of appetite. Cause - A viral infection caused by contagious contact by other CAE positive goats. Remedies - Pasteurizing all milk and colostrum fed to kids, blood testing of goats in herd. There is no k nown cure for CAE. Hoof Rot Symptoms - Lameness in foot or feet, pungent stinking order in hoof, black soft deterioration of inner ridge of hoof. Cause - Prolonged exposure to wet ground or pasture, hoof trimming negligence. Remedies - Regular exercise on dry ground, proper and regular trimming of hoofs. Internal Parasites Goat herd should be on regular worming schedule as advised by local veterinarian in your region. Mastitis Symptoms - Hardening of udder, clotting and blood streaking in milk, fever, and tenderness in udder. Cause - Bacterial exposure, poor hygienic conditions. Remedies - Correct management, overall health, treatable with injectable antibiotics and intra-udder injectable. Lice Symptoms - Weakness, anemia, listlessness in kids, emaciation. Cause - Exposure to domesticated fowl, poor living conditions. Remedies - topical and inject able parasite controls designed specially for use in blood sucking ways. (These are only a few examples of the more common diseases and afflictions encountered by goat farmers. Most goat husbandry books have a complete list of common goat disease symptoms, causes and cures.) Assessment and Review Describe the basics of ruminant digestion. Describe the signs of impending birth and the stages of kidding. Discuss ba sic milking procedure. Name a common ailment of the goat, describe symptoms and suggest a remedy.

What are the basic needs to be provided for in any greenhouse? Resources OBC Northwest Nursery and Greenhouse supplies http://www.obcnw.com/greenhouses.php NOTES HEDGEROWS A hedgerow is a densely planted pattern of trees or shrubs used to create a protective barrier around a field of crops. Learning Objectives The learner will: Identify multiple purposes for hedgerows on the farm Recognize factors influencing hedg erow design Learn the basics of plant selection, planting, and caring for hedgerows. Functions of Hedgerows Physical barrier - to humans or livestock Visual barrier - aesthetically pleasing Wind barrier - block wind, thus decreasing evapotranspiration in fields Create shade - creates niches in field for shade tolerant plants; stops evaporation of water from soil Temperature regulation - vegetation tends to moderate climate extremes Create habitat - habitat for pollinating insects, birds and small critters Create food source - fruits and nuts Create usable material - fuel wood, fencing material, weaving material, posts Prevent erosion - root mass holds soil and blocks runoff Design Factors influencing layout and species selection of hedgerows Environmenta l Factors o Climate - (average high and low temperatures, precipitation) o Soil type - (composition and fertility) o Prevailing wind direction o Aspect -(e.g. north facing slope for fruit trees to avoid early bloom) Site Factors o Location of roads, fields, building s, waterways, etc. Goals of Designer o What purpose(s) will the hedgerow achieve? Opportunities o Create edge - An edge exists where two systems meet and overlap. (i.e. where a forest meets a meadow.) Maximum biological activity takes place along edges. The de signer emphasizes this effect by planting a curving hedge because a curving line has more linear distance between two fixed points than a straight line. o Pathways - The paths between hedgerows can be either clean cultivated, meaning bare-earth with vegetati on either hoed or tilled; or paths can have vegetative cover which is managed to fix nutrients, choke weeds, hold soil, and provide mulching material. (i.e. buckwheat, clover, fescue.) o Special plants - Certain nitrogen -fixing shrubs can be planted amongst fruit and nut trees to provide nitrogen to the trees. (i.e. ceanothus, pea shrubs, eleagnus) Planting Stock If from a nursery, plants should be grown in a similar climate. Plants can come from the nursery in a variety of forms: potted, balled and burlap, and bare root (most common) Home sourced plants can be grown from seed, transplants or cuttings and are especially good because they come from the same climate and ecosystem in which they will live. Planting Choose a time to plant that is appropriate fo r species and region Scalp surrounding area clean of any competing vegetation Make a hole large enough not to impinge roots Trim off broken roots Plant to proper depth (avoid creating a basin for the trees to be submerged in if the rainy season is long. Use appropriate soil amendments. Too much can coddle the tree and the roots will remain in the planting hole and not venture out into native soil. Pat soil around roots until firm but not compacted Water in thoroughly Care and Maintenance Protection o Use fe ncing to protect from deer, beavers, etc. o Line the planting hole with poultry netting before planting to protect from gophers, moles, and voles. o Paint tree trunks of fruit and nut species with white latex paint diluted 50% with water to protect from sun, c old, and borers Mulching o Retains moisture in the soil o Smothers weeds o Moderates soil temperature Pruning o Prune fruit and nut species o Follow specific instructions for type of tree o Pruning is critical in the first few years to maximize tree health and product ivity Irrigation - if required o Determine irrigation schedule ( see \"Irrigation\" chapter ) o Ensure schedule is adequate by observation Annual fertilization o Fertilize during period of dormancy o Foliar spraying is acceptable in the spring Thinning o If hedgerow becomes too crowded, thin out selected trees to create spaces for others Assessment/Review How many distinct functions of hedgerows can you identify? What are some care and maintenance nee ds of hedgerows? Resources Gaia's Garden - Toby Hemenway NOTES HISTORY OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE Learning Objectives The learner will: Gain an understanding of the history of agriculture, both globally and nationally. Develop a context with which to engage in agricultural training. Become familiar with patterns of irre sponsible agricultural practices through case studies of historical events. History of Agriculture Humans as Hunters and Gathers o Humans, as in our genus Homo, existed 2 million years ago. o Humans lived as hunters and gatherers from then until approximate ly 12,000 years ago, when we developed agriculture. o While hunting, fishing, and gathering in the wild, humans had a limited impact on the environment. o Such humans did not have the idea that products of nature could be private property. o Populations were sma ller and land base was larger. Food sources were dependable. Science and Anthropology have proven that although disease and violence were issues during that time, hunger was not. Early Agriculture and the Domestication of Plants o If our history extended over a period of 24 hours, agriculture became a practice in the last 5 minutes. o As populations grew, wild plants and animals were taxed, humans depended more on farming and herding, which, in turn, allowed for increased population. o 12,000 years ago, Agric ulture was independently and simultaneously adopted in the Middle East, China, Mesoamerica, and Peru. o Factors that contributed to the adoption of Agriculture \u0000 12,000 years ago there was a warming trend in each of these regions. \u0000 Decrease in large mammals suc h as mammoths and bison. o Areas agriculture spread to and the native origin of many of our domesticated plant and animal species. \u0000 Southwest Asia - soft wheats, lentils, chickpeas, many vegetables and cows. \u0000 Southeast Asia - barley, oats, millets, soybeans, c abbage, plum/cherry/peach trees. \u0000 Mediterranean - hard wheats, peas, olives, sheep and Goats. \u0000 The Americas - maize, potatoes, beans, tobacco. Civilization and Surplus o Over the last 12,000 years, agriculture has enriched our lives. It has brought us our fav orite foods, beverages, and culinary traditions. It has allowed for fibers, textiles and clothes. It has brought us into domesticated relations with animals. It has fed the inventions of tools, the freedom to specialize, the pride of tending the earth, and the art and culture of civilization. o Agriculture created surplus. Surplus allowed for some individuals to spend time doing specialized activities that gave birth to industry, art, and culture. o The sedentary life made possible by agriculture created more complex social relationships that gave birth to more complicated societies. The Power of Trade o Archaeological sites offer proof of trade. o Humans began to desire special tools, fibers, or foods. Surplus allowed for trade within one society or between neighboring societies. This desire to trade motivated the valuing of land and increase in production. o Control of land and agricultural surplus becomes key to wealth and power. Humans begin to manipulate nature on a larger scale without concern for conseq uences. o Genesis I:26: \"then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that cree peth upon the earth.'\" History of Agriculture in the United States of America Colonization, Land Use, and Settlement o First residents are ancestors of Native Americans. Their presence dates back 14,000 years. They lived as hunters and gatherers, and prac ticed subsistence agriculture. o Most settlers were not farmers and relied on assistance from native peoples. o Colonial power inflicted genocide on native peoples and appropriated over 1 billion acres. o 1775 - 1855, 73.5 million acres given away to men who e nlisted and served in the army and navy. In fact, free land was their incentive. o Generally land is sold to timber companies, railroads, speculators, developers, and ranchers. o 1840's - After pressure to liberalize the distribution of public lands, reformer s attempted to pass homestead legislation: made connection between industry/urban development and diminishing self -sufficiency and demanded land be given to urban residents for free as a means alleviating bad economic conditions of urban factory workers. This didn't pass, eastern industrialists opposed it because it would have deprived them of a work force, western landowners opposed it because they felt it would depreciate land values, and southern planters opposed it thinking it would limit the potential expanse of slave -based agriculture. o 1870's - Acts, encourage cutting of forests, planting of plains, and irrigation of desert. No ecological awareness. o Abundant and cheep land, scarce labor, no markets made pioneer farmers invest mainly in the short te rm: building infrastructure and clearing forest rather than soil or food/animal production. Improved land was more marketable than food. Deforestation and Desertification o Forests covered half of U.S. land, grasses covered 4/10ths. o First century began wit h clearing of over 300 million acres of forest and plowing up over 300 million acres of native grassland. Human Exploitation/Labor o Indentured servants \u0000 Mostly European immigrants working in exchange for their passage from Europe. \u0000 Average contract was 5 -7 years. Many were not fulfilled. o Slavery \u0000 4,000,000 slaves by late 1800's. \u0000 One slave per 10 acres. Regional Specialization \u0000 Corn - Midwest: Illinois, Ohio, Missouri, and Indiana - leading corn producing states in the union. Grown for: the family, feed for workers (often transported to the South), and feed for livestock. Some used for whisky. Pork, 1860 -- hogs used to run wild. Now fenced and fattened on corn, hogs gave cities like Cincinnati the name 'Porkopolis.' A new industry was born: growing corn, feeding it to hogs, and then slaughtering and processing for shipping. Beef, 1850's - Completion of the railroad brought an end to cattle drives, which birthed a new industry of farmers (in Ohio first) fattening their cows off corn. Barbed wire invented in 1880. \u0000 South - cotton \u0000 Deep South, coastal area - rice \u0000 Northeast - dairy, vegetable, horse - more local demand because of urban population Farm Prosperity, 1885 -1930 o Frontier settlement era is over. o Dryland farming is growing in Great Plains. o Increased immigration increases farm output. o Government funded R & D, credit, cooperative marketing The New Deal o The Agricultural Adjustment Act \u0000 The first farm bill \u0000 Paid farmers to reduce crop area \u0000 Decreased surplus \u0000 Raised prices \u0000 Deemed illegal but lead to . . . o The Agricultural Readjustment Act \u0000 Price supports for major storage crops to maintain sufficient supply \u0000 Beginning of farm subsidies: Corn, wheat, rice, cotton, and tobacco World War II o High demand & high prices for food o Food rationing o Off-farm employment Begin ning of Commercial Agriculture After WW II: 1950 -1970 o In one generation, the workforce involved in agriculture declined by half o The value of agricultural products increased by 40% o Modern era of convenience o G.I.

Assessment/Review Consider the context in which you are choosing to become a farmer. How has the historical information learned affected your interest in small and sustainable farming operations? Discuss relevance of historical examples of poor agricultural practices and how to apply lessons learned. IRRIGATION Learning Objectives The learner will: Understand reasons for irrigation Learn to recognize the effects of water stress Learn methods of determining the proper frequency of irrigation Examine various system designs and delivery methods and inves tigate specific advantages and disadvantages. Why Irrigate? Maintain and moderate best temperature for plant life Gives structure and support to plant - water molecules in tissue Unlocks biological and chemical processes in the soil that support plant gr owth Plants use water to form oxygen and carbohydrates Irrigation protects crops from frost Effects of Water Stress Water stressed plants have lower immunity to pests and disease Decreased yield. Plants are particularly sensitive at these stages o Flowerin g stage o Fruit/yield set o Seedling o Fruit ripening Terms and Definitions GPM (gallons per minute) - A measurement of flow (volume of water from given source in one minute) PSI (pounds per square inch) - A measurement of water pressure (the force that water exerts on a given area) o (e.g. Water coming out of a pipe can be expressed both in terms of rate of flow and the force applied to that flow, as in 35 GPM @ 50 PSI.) Velocity - Rate at which water moves through a pipe system. As velocity increases, pressure decreases. Velocity should be 5ft/sec or less. (Use table to determine.) Evaporation - Loss of water from soil to atmosphere Transpiration - Loss of water from plant to atmosphere Evapotranspiration (ET) - Evaporation plus transpiration Evapotranspiration rate (ETo) - Measurement of ET in inches/day Hygroscopic Water - Water held too tightly in soil to be available to plants Capillary Water - Water that is held in pore spaces of soil; available to plants Gravitational Water - Water draining from soil; not a vailable to plants Capillary Action - Movement of water in soil from wet to dry areas Percolation - Movement of gravitational water down through soil Permanent Wilting Point - Boundary between capillary water and hygroscopic water. Plant begins to sustain damage and will die if water is not applied. Field Capacity - Boundary between gravitational water and capillary water (upper limit for soil moisture available to plant) Available Water - Amount of water available to plants Frequency of Irrigation Soil T est Method Manual test - Soil is felt and observed at the root zone of the plant. Water is applied when soil is at 50% -75% of field capacity (depends on crop specifics). Charts are available as a guide to this method, but judgment is largely based on site -specific experience. Mechanical test - Tensiometer Soil Budget Method Calculate site ETo o Get from local extension office o Measure time for one inch of water to evaporate from a pan. Replace water as it evaporates from field capacity using measured amounts from an irrigation system. Example/Exercise: If local ETo is .4in/day, how much water needs to be applied in a week? o Formula is PR = (96.3xGPM)/(SxL) o PR = precipitation rate measured in in/hr o 96.3 = constant o GPM = gallon per minute water flow in measured a rea o S = in -line spacing of sprinklers or emitters in feet o L = lateral spacing of sprinklers or emitters in feet Factors Affecting Irrigation Frequency Climate As temperature increases, ETo increases As wind increases, ETo increases As humidity increases, ETo decreases As precipitation increases, ETo decreases Soil Type (see charts) Coarse - sand - drains quickly, increase frequency of irrigation Medium - loam - drains moderately Fine - clay - drains slowly, decrease frequency of irrigation Slope (see ch arts) The steeper the slope, the less water the soil can absorb before run -off. Crop Specifics Water loving or drought tolerant Germinating direct seeded crops Dry down during ripening Perennials Irrigation Systems Design Considerations Determine Source Pond or other open source (gravity feed or pump) Well Determine GPM and PSI at delivery point Flow test with bucket and stopwatch PSI test with gauge Determine pipe size using tables Determine delivery method based on GPM, PSI, and field requirements Drip or Micro For row crops, typically T -tape coming from 1/2\" to 1\" manifold, with filters and pressure regulators. o Advantages Good for limited water source Efficient direct delivery of water to root zone Fewer Weeds o Disadvantages Maintenance on filters Limited life Overhead Sprinkler Buried PVC (A system in which sprinklers come directly from a buried PVC via a vertical riser) Must be designed correctly and buried deep enough to avoid cultivation o Advantages More ambient cooling Longer life o Disadvantages Less efficient Can promote mold/disease Takes higher flow Aluminum Hand Line (Pipe and sprinklers are all above ground and are supplied with water from a riser valve coming off of the main system at the top of the row or field) Requires less buried PVC. -20'-30' pieces are moved as needed. Have impact heads. Connect to fittings at top of field or row. Flood Sheet of water over established vegetation. Best for pasture or cover crop.

What are the benefits of organizing & activism? PLANT PATHOGENS Learning Objectives The learner will: Become familiar with various types of plant pathogens or disease agents. Examine various methods of disease management. Plant Pathogen Overview A plant pathogen is any harmful introduced infectious agent, organism, or condition that reduces a plant's overall vitality, inhibits its growth, or limits the ability of the plant to survive and reproduce. Pathogens can be delivered in a multitude of different ways. These include: bacteria, fungi, viruses, n ematodes, oomycetes, and abiotic toxicities. There are several different factors that need to be present in order to create an outbreak of disease on the farm. The pathogen must be present. There must be suitable host plants around. And there must be favor able environmental conditions for the growth and development of that particular plant pathogen. Disease Agents Bacteria: These single cell organisms absorb the nutrition from their host plant and thrive by killing the plant and living off of their decomp osing organic matter. This is often described as a saprophytic relationship. Bacterial pathogens cause blights, rots, and wilts. Fungi: Fungal pathogens are spread by many different environmental conditions such as wind water, seeds, human and other non -human vectors. (A vector is a host capable of transferring a particular pathogen.) Fungi that are capable of regenerating spores during the growing season and re -infecting plants are known as polycyclic. Fungi that must wait for next season are monocyclic. Viruses: Viruses are pieces of genetic material (RNA/DNA) and disturb the plants by mimicking naturally occurring genetic abnormalities. There are more than 700 plant viruses known. Viruses can be spread by tractors or equipment, tainted seed, or by a trave ling vector. Nematodes: Nematodes are both a pathogen and a vector. Nematodes are microscopic worms and are one of the most abundant phyla with over 20,000 different species. A nematode either infects a plant by injecting a needle like mouth into the plant or it actually enters the plant with its entire body. The nematode's saliva is the infecting agent and disturbs the metabolic process of the plant and causes disease and death. Abiotic: This refers to deficiencies in the soil or surrounding environment th at cause a debilitating illness that is harmful or fatal to the plant. Oomycetes: These organisms act much like a fungi, however they have a very different evolutionary history. They have mobile spores and can be primarily spread by both wind and water. Ve ctors can also spread them. An example of an oomycetes is \"downy mildew\" also known as \"damping off.\" Disease Management Plants often have developed natural defenses against pathogens. Some plants have developed disease tolerance. Some plants have develo ped disease resistance. Plants that are disease resistant will exhibit characteristics that actually repel certain harmful disease known to attack that particular plant. Plants that are disease tolerant can live with a problem pathogen but survive without any substantial reduction in yield or overall health. Proper greenhouse management can be extremely helpful in the control of outbreak and spread of pathogens. Disinfecting all soil trays and propagating mediums greatly reduces the incidence of pathogens. A solid approach to crop rotation will also limit the spread and overall effect of certain diseases. This is a result of diversity increasing overall vitality, limiting host species, and reducing environmental conditions needed for disease to flourish and spread in similar varieties or families of plants. Recognizing pre -existing factors that may contribute to pathogen outbreak is an important aspect of disease control. An example would be being vigilant and wary of downy mildew in a very wet or coastal env ironment. In some organic situations, chemical control of disease is necessary and allowed by organic standards. Effected host plants can be physically removed or treated with such elements as copper, sulfur, or neem. It is always recommended that you cons ult with an expert before using or adding any amendment to your fields to help control disease. Overall plant vitality is probably the single most important element for fighting and combating disease in your garden or field. Pathogens have the tendency to attack weak or stressed plants in the garden. If a disease establishes itself using the weaker plants it can often jump to the stronger crops. Therefore, maintaining conditions favorable to general plant vitality can significantly reduce the occurrence of disease. Removing harvested plants quickly and composting effectively will reduce instance of pathogens as well. Assessment/Review What is a vector? What are several types of pathogens and how do they affect the plant? What essential disease prevention m ethods should be used on the farm to reduce the risk of pathogens?

Producers wanting to slaughter their own birds, up to 20,000 per year, must build a state-licensed and -approved facility. (Contrary to what you may have heard, our state doesn't recognize USDA's 1 ,000 bird exemption, only the 20,000 bird exemption). o This might change. Lauren Gwin is working with the Oregon Department of Agriculture on a proposal to allow poultry producers to slaughter up to 1,000 birds (any poultry) per year on their farm, for on -farm fresh sales only. Exact requirement are still being discussed, but producers would likely be required to keep sales records and a customer list. o Marketing Eggs: Direct vs. Retail o Designations: certified organic, free -range, free -nested, cage free Meat Assessment/Review What role can chickens play in an agricultural ecosystem?

Damerow, G. 1994, Books, North Adams, MA.344 pp. Walla Walla, WA Murray McMurray, Webster City, IA NOTES SEEDS Learning Objectives The learner will: Understand the basics of seeds, including botany, pollination, breeding and saving. Basic Botany Nomenclature (Family ->Genus ->Species ->Variety) Ex. > \"Scarlet species (i.e. Zucchini ( Cucurita pepo ) will cross with with buttercup squash ( C.maxima ) but rarely across species barriers mules) parts (Pistil/ Stamen/ Anther/ Style/ petals /sepals / ovary) seed producers Biennials include carrots, beets, parsley, cabbage family, kale, onions, leeks, Swiss chard Monecious Dioecious (i.e. spinach) - Brassicas, onions, carrots, parsley - chard, spinach, oaks, Self-Pollinated - Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, lettuce, beans, peas Extra -floral nectarines - plants entice pollinators with the sweet stuff! Cross Pollinated Crops - need isolation from one another (usually a minimum of \u00bd mile) Self Pollinated Crops - less or no isolation requirements Timed Isolation - planting times are staggered to avoid overlapping flowering (work well with corn) Inbreeding Depression - minimum population sizes are needs with the cross -pollinated crops to avoid \"bottlenecking\" the genetic diversity of the population. Generally 120 plants are required, an exception is the cucurbits, where you only need 10 plants. Inbreeding depression is the result of too small of a population = reduced vigor, smaller yields, more susceptible to pests and disease. Hybrid - refers to a crossing of two separate varieties. An F1 hybrid is generally when two uniform inbred lines are crossed. The resulting generation is the F1 (for f irst filial), and then next season would be the F2 and so forth. Heterosis - is the term to describe hybrid vigor which results from broadening the genetic base (the opposite of inbreeding depression) Grex - a hybrid with many parents Strain cross - crossing two strains of the same variety Advantages to saving your own seed - save money, seed security, and possible to select for adaptation to disease, pests, climate and soils; provide nectar source for pollinators and beneficial insects. Fun, Learning and seed to share! Wet Processed vs. Dry Processed seeds - Wet processed include tomatoes, melons, eggplant, squash, cucumbers, peppers. Most all others are harvested when seedpods are dry. NOTES SOIL SCIENCE The understanding of basic soil science is important for many different reasons on the farm. It offers long -term farm security and viability through proper management of any farms most valuable resource, soil. It also plays a larger role in the health of a watershed or regional eco - system by combating erosion or nutrient pollution in our streams and rivers. Individuals who study and pay close attention to there soils structure and content will see far better results in cultivation and yield and will better be able to address negative issues encountered while growing on, and managing farmland. Learning Objectives The learner will understand the following basics through in -field study: Understand how soils form Understand soil characteristic s and how they effect crop growth Learn why and how to take soil samples, what to test for and what to do with the results Learn how to manage for healthy soil ecosystems, increased fertility, and sustainable crop production How Soils Form ClORPT Concept : Climate, Organisms, Relief, Parent Material, Time Soil Toposequence: Moving from the ridge top to valley bottom, soil characteristics vary greatly. Soil Characteristics Soil Components: Minerals (45%), Air and Water (25% each), and Organic Matter (usually 2 - 5%) Soil Texture: Sand, silt, & clay, the soil triangle, and associated properties: o Sandy soils - low water and nutrient holding capacity, droughty o Clay soils - high water and nutrient holding capacity, but low permeability, poor tilth Soil Nutri ent Profile: major and minor nutrients, trace elements Cation Exchange Capacity: capacity of negatively charged humus and clay particles (colloids) to hold cations (Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium - also sodium & ammonia) - importance o Albrecht system PH (and its relation to CEC - if your bases are balanced, pH will take care of itself) Soil Biotic Community We know that an acre of soil can support or produce 2000 lbs of beef (cow / calf pair), 5 sheep, and lots of chickens, for example, but we rarely consi der the extent of the soil fauna living underground: 1 acre of topsoil contains approximately 900 pounds of earthworms, 2,400 pounds of fungi, 1,500 pounds of bacteria, 133 pounds of Protozoa, 890 pounds of arthropods and algae, and small mammals. Earthwor ms - air & water penetration, high -nutrient castings, secretion of plant growth stimulant, natural soil tiller. Arthropods - sow bugs, centipedes, slugs, snails, and springtails: primary decomposers. Bacteria - make plant growth hormones, make nutrients an d minerals available to plants, fix atmospheric nitrogen, fight root diseases, and detoxify soils. Fungi - break down OM and release nutrients available to plants, produce plant hormones and antibiotics, mycorrhizal associations. Actinomycetes - threadlike bacteria that look like fungi: decompose OM, produce root disease -fighting antibiotics, and produce a sweet, \"earthy\" smell. Algae - upper \u00bd inch, fix nitrogen and enhance soil structure by producing biologic glues. Protozoa - free-living organisms that s wim in soil water, eating bacteria and speeding up the nutrient cycle. Nematodes - eat decaying plant litter, bacteria, algae, protozoa, and other nematodes - only a few species harmful to plants. Key to managing for a healthy soil community: build soil o rganic matter Soil Organic Matter Carbon Cycle: role of C (CO2) and how to manage it. Humus, Humic Acid (organic compounds containing displaceable hydrogen), Humate (the salt of a humic acid, where hydrogen has been displaced by cations such as potassium , calcium, and magnesium) Managing SOM: cover crops, field rotations, compost and compost tea applications, etc. Tillage systems Nitrogen Cycle: role of N, and how to manage it. Soil Testing and Assessment What to test, how to test, when to test: texture , major nutrients, minors and trace, pH, CEC, soil biotic community. o Conventional o Emphasis on Mineral Analysis: Albrecht System o Soil Biotic Communities o USDA Soil Quality Test Assessment/Review How is soil formed? What are some important soil characterist ics? Explain cation exchange capacity and how to improve it. Describe a cropping system that improves soil organic matter and enhances the soil biotic community. NOTES TRANSPLANTING Learning Objectives The learner will: Gain a solid understanding of proper transplanting techniques, and in doing so create the best environment for transplanted starts to thrive. Why are Certain Crops Transplanted? Greenhouse advantage o Grea ter climate control o Greater season extension o Intensive rather than extensive management of seedlings o Rapid crop successions Root nature of transplanted crops May allow for greater control over specific density of crops Assess Plant, Soil, and Environment al Conditions Prior to Transplanting Assess the compatibility of the following environmental conditions and seedling maturity with the planned tasks. Seedling development necessary for successful transplanting o Shoot development o Root development Seedling pr e-treatments necessary for successful transplanting o Soil/mix moisture Cell-grown seedlings at field capacity Flat-grown seedlings at 50% -75% of field capacity Transition from Greenhouse to Field o Hardening -off period: Hardening off reduces amount of stress for start by gradually increasing amount of exposure to outside elements. Hardening off should start at least 15 days prior to acceptable field transplant date. Move starts to cold frame two weeks before they are ready to enter the field, cover off in the day and on at night Leave the starts exposed to the elements for a half hour to an hour longer each consecutive day. Finally, leave them exposed all day and all night the final three days. Soil conditions favorable for successful transplanting Optimal phys ical environmental conditions favorable for successful transplanting of flat - grown seedlings o Low light levels o Low temperature o Low wind speed o High humidity Transplanting Starts Starts should be thoroughly watered before being transplanted. This great ly reduces shock. Using a weak fish emulsion solution just prior to transplant will also encourage plants to take off quickly. Keep starts in shaded area until they enter the ground. When pulling apart individual soil blocks or removing starts from trays, carefully separate the intertwined root growth, causing as little trauma as possible, while still remaining efficient. Do not expose tender root systems to direct sunlight (as little as fifteen seconds of exposure can kill off roots). Using your hand or a planting tool create the right depth and size hole in the bed or row being planted. Some farmers will sprinkle a little organic fertilizer in the hole just prior to planting. This should be done only if the quality of the soil requires that extra boost. Gently tease the roots before planting the start; this encourages new outward growth of the roots. Take special care to insure the top of the soil block or cell being planted is covered with native field soil; this greatly reduces the natural drying out proc ess during the beginning of the plants field life. Some farmers apply a gentle amount of pressure to the base of transplants after planting; others allow the natural \"watering -in\" process to settle the soil around the new transplant. What works for one may not work for another, and much of that has to do with the style of irrigation being used. An overhead irrigation system is going settle the soil around the plant much better than a drip system. Using our drip system at Boones Farm we've found applying a gentle amount of pressure encourages the pooling of water around the base of the start. Always water in a new start. This is the highest preventative measure you can take against shock. The best time to transplant any start is in the cool of the evening. Th is allows the plant a nice buffer to become acquainted with its new surroundings before dealing with a hot sun. NOTES WATER HARVEST THROUG H KEYLINE DESIGN Learning Objectives The learner will... Understand the basics of keyline design. Review opportunities for different types of water storage and water delivery systems. Purposes of Keyline Design Maximize water resourc es through systems designed to catch, direct, and store water in ponds and soil Use gravity to move water Provide a system of whole farm design, including all roads and surfaces that drain water Background History: P.A. Yoemans of New South Wales, Austra lia developed the keyline method to stretch water resources available on his ranch in its arid climate. The practice became a model for sustainable agriculture. Important definitions: o Keypoint - any point in a watershed where the slope changes by 5% or mor e o Keyline - the contour line which would intersect a keypoint Theory: Keypoints are typically places where water tends to collect. This point may be a spring, a point of increased stream flow, or simply underground water nearer the surface. The keypoint an d keyline serve as points to harvest water into catchment systems or soils in the desired area. Water Storage in Ponds, Reservoirs and Tanks Placement Pond should be designed so that the elevation of its maximum water level is slightly below the elevatio n of the water source. Typically, a drop in elevation of 1 vertical foot for every 100 -300 horizontal feet is used. Pond should be placed out on a ridge, away from the drainage in a watershed. Ponds placed in -stream will always blow out. Ponds placed out o n the slope maximize the amount of land available to be gravity irrigated by keeping water higher on the landscape. Sources of Catchment All road surfaces inwaled to direct water into catchment system Spring or stream flow captured in pipe and delivered w ith gravity to system Rainfall: slopes carry water to system Increase catch area: using small gently sloping ditches, direct water shed from adjacent slopes to the catchment system Lining Earth lined : best for ponds that can be kept full. Clay or bentonit e seals will crack when exposed to long periods of sun and dry. Plastic liner : good for ponds where water resources are scarce Delivery Systems Siphon : using suction to pull water through a pipe over the dam wall and to an irrigation system at the head of a field below Lock pipe : draining water from the bottom of the pond to field via a pipe buried beneath the dam wall. Pump : using solar, gas, or electricity to power a pump to pull water out of the pond and to the field. Considerations Local codes and req uirements Need for engineer in pond design Careful, professional construction of all systems H2O Storage in Soil 1) Soil contouring via swales A swale is a ditch laid out on contour so that it holds water instead of drains water. The long -term effect of a swale is the same as that of an unlined pond - to create an underground stored lens of water, which deep -rooted plants are able to tap. 2) Soil cultivation All fields laid out on contour to minimize erosion and maximize water storage capacity Soil is ri pped with subsoil or chisel plow (a \"keyline plow\" is a specific type of subsoil plow) on contour, slowing the flow of water off of a slope, encouraging water to seep into rips. Benefits of contour/subsoil cultivation: Increases water holding cap acity of soil Breaks up hardpan and loosens clay soil Encourages formation of topsoil Retains soil structure - passive tillage does not invert soil Enables better root growth of crops Lifts rocks out of soil Aerates soil Mulch Regulates soil tempera ture Reduces water evaporation from soil surface Smothers weeds Assessment/Review What are a keyline and a keypoint? What are the three basic water storage methods discussed in this section? What practices can increase the soil's ability to store water? Resources Water for Every Farm by P.A. Yeoman's NOTES WEED MANAGEMENT Pre-Assessment Questions What is a weed? How are weeds dispersed? What are some benefits of weeds in a cropping system? What are some of the characteristics of weeds that allow them to compete so well in cropping systems? Why control weeds? Definition -What is a weed? A weed is any plant, native or non -native, that interferes with crop production by doing more harm than good and has a habit of encroaching where it is not wanted. Weed Problems Crop competition and its effect on crop yield an d quality o Nutrient competition o Light competition o Water competition Interference with harvesting operations o Example: Weed roots such as bindweed wrap around sub -soil blades used for undercutting root crops during harvest Weed Benefits Enhance soil structure Improve soil tilth Cycle nutrients Provide habitat for beneficial insects Improve soil water infiltration Weed Prevention Strategies Improve soil tilth, aeration, water infiltration, and fertility to optimize crop growth and minimize weed pressure Thorou ghly clean equipment before moving it from one farm or location to another Do not allow weeds to form seed heads and/or perennial rooting structures in the cropping system. Thoroughly compost all imported animal manures to insure destruction of viable weed seed Filter surface irrigation water to avoid importing weed seeds Work with neighbors to eliminate or minimize the potential for spread of noxious and problematic weeds from adjacent lands Identification Tour fields and identify most common weeds (star thistle, pigweed, purslane, chicory, wild lettuce, grasses, etc.) Pull or dig selected weeds and examine root system Management through Manual Cultivation Demonstrate and practice proper techniques with various tools - wheel hoe, stirrup hoe, collinear h oe, and Mexican hoe. Discuss need for follow -up cultivation. o Benefits - eliminates weeds, stirs soil and breaks crust (allows for easier penetration of air and water) NOTES FARMING ON THE WILD SIDE Learning Objectives The learner will: Learn about the different approaches to ecological farming and give examples Understand ecological processes underlying ecological farming approaches Understand attributes of natural systems f arming, agroforestry systems, and wild farming approaches Ecological Farming Systems Farming in Nature's Image: Natural Systems Farming o Home Gardens/Forest Gardens o Land Institute & Perennial Polyculture o Rotational/Mixed Species Grazing Systems (Savory & others) Agroforestry/Silvopastorialism/Agrosilvopastorialism o Agroforestry: growing herbaceous crops and trees together o Silvopastorialism: raising livestock and tree crops together o Agrosilvopastorialism: livestock, crops and trees o Agroforestry System Attri butes Deep nutrient cycling Enhanced wildlife/livestock habitat Increased biotic diversity Increased crop diversity o Examples: Windbreaks/hedgerows Live fences Alley cropping Field/Pasture Trees (Acacia albida, Oregon white oak) Taungya Forest Gardens Wild Farming: Biodiversity on Farms and Ranches o Importance of biodiversity o Wild Farming Practices Water Conservation Soil Conservation Soil Fertility Management Livestock Management o Biodiversity: Incorporating Natural Areas on the Farm Practices Riparian Areas Woodlands Hedgerows Beetle Banks Field Margins o Biodiversity Within Farmed Areas Cover Crops Intercropping Strip Cropping Insectaries & Pest Strips Low or no till Alternate Mowing Ecological Processes in Healthy Agroecosystems Nutrient Cycling (deeper, b alanced cycles) Hydrology (enhanced infiltration, soil moisture storage) Energetics (enhanced capture of solar and water inputs) Soil Conservation and Building Predator - Prey Relationships (beneficial insects, birds and mammals for pest control) Disturban ce (herbivory) Assessment/Review How would you mimic a prairie in an agroecosystem?

Receive an introduction to production aids relative to winter farming. Climate Crop possibilities vary widely with climate, but genera lly there are crops that are well suited to winter production in most cold climates (i.e. cabbage family, roots, and greens.) Maritime Pacific Northwest climate o Good for winter crops, ground generally does not freeze o Cool and moist means no irrigation requ ired, but promotes rot and disease o Production aids are beneficial Colder climates o Winter harvest possible with production aides. (see \" Production Aids \" section of this chapter.) Winter Harvest Means Summer Planting The key to fall/winter harvest is to se ed crop in the summer to achieve adequate growth by the end of October. Decreasing levels of light in fall will slow plant growth to near dormancy. Growth resumes in late winter when the light levels increase. Due to the seasonal lack of light and growth, vegetables harvested from November through March must be mature by the end of October. (The exception is over -wintered crops - see \" Over -Wintered Crops \" section of this chapter.) Growth resumes in late winter when most plants will start to flower. If green s become bitter or roots become woody, crops are past their harvest window. Lots of space required. No succession planting is possible after this harvest because the soil is too wet, (or even frozen in northern interior climate zones.) Over -Wintered Cro ps Planted in late summer for a spring harvest. (An exception to this would be garlic that should be planted in the fall for a summer harvest.) Successfully over -wintered crops achieve enough growth by the end of October to survive the cold, possible snow, and lots of rain. Growth resumes in late winter and crop reaches maturity in spring. Production Aids Season Extension using farming techniques and/or structures to increase soil temperature or shield crop from extreme weather, which enables steady crop growth, extends later into fall and begins earlier in spring. o December and January - lowest light but warmth will aid slower growth o Nov, Feb, March - more light and higher outdoor temps mean slightly faster growth Warm and sheltered spot o South facing slope o Windbreak Mulches o Straw moderates soil temperature; prevents freezing o Plastic raises soil temperature Low covers o Remay or plastic over wire hoops to create a tunnel over a row crop Cold frames o Low wood frame with glass or plastic over top Walk -in tunnels o Plastic over hoops, tall enough to work in Greenhouses o Permanent, framed skeleton with glass or plastic for roof Storage Crops Grown in Summer, harvested in Fall, stored for Winter use o Potatoes - Store @ 35 degrees and high humidity o Winter Squash - Store @ 50-55 degrees and dry o Onions and Garlic - Store @ 40 degrees and dry Assessment/Review Can you differentiate between the planting and growth schedules of Fall/Winter harvest crops and over -wintered crops? Name several ways of extending the season by using production aids. What crops are generally well suited to winter production in most climates? Resources: Four Season Harvest by Elliot Coleman NOTES DIRECT SEEDING (Field Exercise) First, discuss what crops to direct seed and why. I. Preparation of bed A. Incorporation of green manure crop (discuss) B. Subsoiling (discuss) C. Forming bed, addition and incorporation of amendments - activity/demonstration. Use tractor and rototiller. Discuss that seed size dictates fineness of soil needed to direct seed. Base amendments on needs of crop. II. Seeding A. Methods 1. Seeder - choose correct plate for seed, troubleshooting, gauging success 2. Hand - slower but more accurate, inappropriate for larger scale B. Determining depth of seed - rule of thumb C. Covering seed - with soil or sand - discuss pros and cons III. Subsequent A. Irrigation - frequent and sufficient enough to ensure good germination - critical at seedling stage in hot weather. B. Thinning - when plants reach appropriate size, thin to desi red spacing - based on desired size at harvest. Demons trate/practice thinning. Harvest/post -harvest handling and Food Safety Learning Objectives The learner will: Understand the importance of attentive harvest, packing, storage and transportation to providing quality product. Understanding how management practices affect post -harvest condition. Understanding how food safety practices begin in the field and carry through harvest & post -harvest handling. Provide resource access. Harvesting Demonstration Roots - carrots, beets, radish, parsnips, etc. Use digging fork or shovel to l oosen soil, if necessary. Pull roots, using wooden baskets for container. Should be set in shade until washed. If this will be more than an hour and it's a hot day, remove greens from the roots to prevent dehydration. Fruits - nightshades, cucurbitae, etc. Determine which will be harvested based on ripeness. For nightshades, gently pull, or snip, the fruit from the plant. For cucurbitae, cut at stem with knife. Skin of fruits is more sensitive, so a lined wooden basket or a plastic container is used. Should store in shade until washing or boxing. Greens - lettuce, spinach, broccoli. Determine which plants to harvest based on maturity. Demonstrate proper use of harvest knife for cutting heads. Also demonstrate picking or cutting technique if only leaves are h arvested. Quick cooling of greens is essential. Keep out of sun and wash as soon as possible. Decision Making for Harvest Type of produce being harvested: Care should be taken to understand the ability of any given item to hold up post harvest in the fie ld. There are some that can endure a lot of stress and go to market looking great and others such as lettuce that need utmost sensitivity. Time until sale: Leafy produce should be harvested and cooled just prior to distribution or market (unless refrigerat ion is available). Some produce like winter squash or garlic can be processed and stored for months prior to distribution. Weather conditions outside: The time of day a certain item is harvested, and the time that item sits in the field after harvest can d iffer greatly depending on the weather outside. If the temp is 50 degrees, under an overcast sky, your urgency is greatly reduced. Beans and other produce, which should be dry upon harvest, should not be harvested in the rain or first thing in the morning when dew is present. Cold Storage/Cool Pack resource availability: If refrigeration is available on site, taking the \"field heat\" out of an item is often enough cooling before going into reefer storage. If there is no onsite reefer, top icing wax boxes is often necessary to keep produce in prime condition before delivery. Field durability: Some items hold up just fine under the sun for a brief time. Other items like greens and lettuce should be shaded immediately after harvest and hydro -cooled as soon as po ssible. Specific Handling Procedures Based on Type of Produce Greens and Lettuces should not spend any significant time in the field or without adequate shade. They should generally be harvested first, and cooled in cold water/ice bath immediately after leaving the field. Lettuces and greens should be inspected and cleaned before entering bath. Green beans should be harvested before mid -day heat is present. Beans cannot be hydro -cooled (cold bath) because of rust due to excessive moisture, therefore, should be cooled in reefer as soon as they are harvested to preserve crispness. Beets and Carrots should be forked, followed by simultaneous washing and hydro -cooling. Pull off any ugly greens of carrots; be slightly less critical of beets due to the fact tha t there greens are so widely enjoyed. They should be bunched and stored below forty degrees. Carrots do well in bins or perforated bags in cold storage. Broccoli and Cauliflower should be iced and or hydro -cooled immediately following harvest. Special care should be taken to insure green caterpillars are not present under the \"trees\". Cucumbers should be hydro -cooled immediately and washed down to remove any \"spike\" that may be present. Cucumbers can be stored in lugs or flats with lids and should be kept c ool between forty and fifty degrees. Eggplants should be handled with delicate care following harvest. The skin shows rough treatment and punctures with ease. Eggplants should be sold as soon as possible. Tomatoes can be harvested at any time of the day, a nd should be packed gently into a box immediately following. Egg crate packaging is the best for avoiding tomato damage and layers should not be stacked more than four high in a box. Large heirloom varieties have a tendency to be VERY delicate and should b e handled appropriately. Green tomatoes gleaned from vine before frost can be wrapped individually in newspaper and stored in a cool area inside a wax box. They will slowly ripen and provide you with tomatoes from your garden long after the last plants out side have died off. Salad Mix is generally placed in cold -water bath after harvest. This keeps temperature down while providing the farmer a good opportunity to thoroughly mix the salad for good uniformity. It is during this time in which you can pick out weeds and ugly leaves. Following the washing and mixing the salad should be thoroughly spun dried. It is important that the mix is relatively dried before being bagged, excessive moisture can lead to rot. Perforated bags are helpful. Melons can be harveste d at your leisure although a melon harvested in the cool of morning will have a better texture down the road than a melon harvested in the deep heat. They should be stored around 45 degrees and can last for a couple of weeks. Potatoes can be harvested anyt ime of the day but should be handled carefully afterwards. It is now the accepted method of post harvest handling of tubers to either not wash them at all or give them the lightest of dustings. This reduces the chance of disturbing or tearing their skin an d thus greatly reducing there storage time. Potatoes can be stored in jute bags or bins. Store in a cool dark place for optimal length of storage. Onions/Garlic generally need some curing after harvest. This provides an opportunity to dry the stem, making it possible to clip then store the produce. Garlic is often cured by hanging it in bunched of ten to twenty in a relatively cool dark space. Onions can be cured by laying them out on mesh wire with decent airflow above and below them. This insures good eve n drying of the stem and will provide the neck a good closure. This is important to promote good storability. Food Safety Key production considerations: Water & irrigation Soil amendments - manure Equipment cleaning Key harvest considerations : Food co ntact surfaces Soil contact Tools Water used during harvest Transportation Containers Cooling Key processing considerations : Wash water Personal health & hygiene Effective sanitation practices for facility, equipment, utensils Key storage considerations : Temperature/proper cooling Moisture/respiration Packaging Food Safety Issues : Why have on -farm practices become a focus?

Why are food safety considerations and regulations increasing? MILKING (Field Exercise) The purpose of this field exercise is to learn and experience the proper way to set up, and perform milking responsibilities in a way that is beneficial and efficient for the producer, as well as comfortable and healthful for the herd. Milking Parlor A proper milk parlor should contain milk stands with feeders, a reserve of mixed grain for feeding, stainless tables for milk equipment, stools at an ergonomically proper height for milking, goat sanitizing supplies, running water for hand washing, a complete line of milking equipment, and a lidded trash can for waste disposal. Th e milk parlor should have a sloped concrete drain fl oor, washable walls, screen doors, and good ventilation. Th e milk parlor should be far enough away and enclosed from goat housing to insure against dirt or fecal cross contamination. Pre-Milking Procedures G oat(s) are brought into milking parlor and immediately climb onto milk stand. Goats are fed in grain dishes attached to milk stand. If l ong hair is present on goat's belly or inside of upper legs, goat should be thoroughly shaved. Goat 's belly and udders are then rubbed down with warm wa ter. This accomplishes two simultaneous goals: First being removal of dirt, loose hairs, and any other fine particulate th at could potentially fall into milk pail during milking. The second function is that warm water stimulates milk moveme nt to the bottom of the udder and makes milking the goat thoroughly much easier. The goat is quickly dried using one paper towel. Go at belly and udders are then sprayed down with diluted io dine solution; teats are washed and dried first, followed by remainder of udder, then the rest of belly. (It is during this stage of cleaning the udders that a thorough inspection of the entire udder and teats takes place. Any abnormality should be noted and dealt with promptly. Possible abnormalities could be bumps or other external anomalies on the udder and teats.) Milking Properly The first stream of milk from each teat is deposited in strip cup. Strip cup is simple al uminum receptacle with a fine screen designed to trap any fluid abnormalities in milk. These abnormalities could be lumps or stringiness in milk, which would indicate possible early detection of mastitis. Milk ing begins at this point. The milker should hold the teats in the space between thumb and pointer finger. Prope r milking should involve the filling of teats followed by \"inching \" or squeezing the top of the teat so upon use of finger rolling, milk does not flow upward back into the udder. M ilk should be \"rolled\" out of the teat, alternating both hands to find a rhythm that is comfortable for both milker and goat. It's very important that the farmer doing the milking does no t grab above the point where the teat meets the udder. This is due to the fact that the cells inside the teat are able to handle intense pressure without the worry of cellular rupture, and cells at the base of the udder are more susceptible to rupture leading to infection or possible mastitis. As the milk flow decreases, the milker should simulate the f eeding behavior of kids to help urge any remaining milk in the udder to drop down lower where it would be accessible to milk out comp letely. This is done by using an upward- facing open palm and firmly \"popping\" or \"massaging\" the entire udder in an upward movement. This knocks any remaining milk in the upper portion of the udder down closer to the teat where it can be easily milked out. Immediately following the coaxing of remaining milk, continue milking for a short time, then repeat coaxing and milking several times. Fin ish milking goat by \"stripping\" out teat. This is done by gathering and expelling last little milk from udder and teat by narrowing your grasp where the ud der meets the teat and GENTLY appl y a squeezing motion down the teat. Immed iately following milking, each teat should be dipped in a teat dip cup filled with a post milking product designed to seal off milk canals that have been opened during milking. This product is also an anti-bacterial. This application prevents any possible bacteria from traveling up the open milk canal. Post Milking Milk Handling Milk should immediately be poured from pale to lidded stainless storage tote. All milk collected should be transported to available facility fo r cooling. Milk should not be left for more than forty-five minutes in tote. The faster the milk is brought down to an appropriate temperature (low forties) the better quality milk. All stainless milk receivi ng equipment should be immediately washed with lu kewarm water and anti-bacterial soap. All equ ipment should then be rack dried thoroughly. Al l milk should be cooled in heat exchanger or ice water bath immediately after being received at the creamery or kitchen. STARTING PLANTS IN A GREENHOUSE (Field Exercise) I. Making the soil mix A. Ingredients 1. For air porosity, drainage, and texture: sand, perlite, pumice, vermiculite, etc. 2. For fiber, body, organic matter, water holding capacity: peat moss, coconut fiber 3. For introduction of soil micro-organisms; bi ological aspects of soil: compost or soil 4. For nutrition: addition of NPK and trace minerals B. Method 1. Mix ingredients starting with the driest (p erlite,etc) and ending with the wettest (compost/soil). a. Mix with shovel in contained area b. Mix with cement mixer 2. Add water and continue mixing. Add until wa ter can be squeezed from the soil by hand. II. Making soil blocks A. Advantages 1. More soil for root development 2. Roots do not circle 3. Easy to transplant 4. Saves space in greenhouse B. Make flat of 1\" soil blocks with floor blocker - for most seeds C. Make flat of 2\" soil blocks with hand blocker - for large seed *Size of block also depends on type of plant and length of time in the greenhouse III. Seeding A. Seeding method in soil block - seed three different size seeds into soil blocks. Try different methods of dropping seed - by hand, with moist toothpick, with folded seed packet. B. Covering seed for darkness - cover with porous medi um that will not crust - sand or vermiculite is best. Also provides a base of support for seedling. IV. Supplemental care A. Watering method - water immediately after covering seed. Must be kept moist for seed to germinate, and obviously for continued growth. Discuss subsequent irrigation options. B. Nutrition - best provided with foliar spray of compost tea. Aids in rapid plant growth, disease prevention. Adds live component through compost. Make compost tea: 4 cup compost, 1 cup liquid fish and kelp, 1 tbsp molasses, two gallons water. Mix well and aerate for 24 hours. Apply with backpack sprayer. TRACTOR 101 This lesson plan is geared towards the operation of a Kubota 3410; nearly all the information is transferable to most small farm tractors. However, it is very important when operating any tractor that one has a solid fundamental understanding of the particular tractor's nuances, lever and gear positions, and safe operating guidelines. Learning Objectives The learner will: Understand the basic functions and operations of a Kubota tractor. Understand the basic safety features and concerns of op erating a Kubota tractor. Understanding the Various Controls on the Tractor Starting the Tractor o The Kubota and most small farm tractors are started by turning the key to the right one click until the light for the glow plugs comes on and then goes off again. You may then depress the clutch and turn the key all the way to the right until the engine turns over. o On cold mornings the choke may be required. This is operated by pulling the choke (located near the key) all the way out. As you turn the engin e over, slowly push the choke back in until the engine kicks on. o It is very important that the throttle be pushed all the way in the upward (turtle) position before starting the tractor. This gives the tractor an opportunity to warm up in the idle positio n, which is very important for any diesel engine. Throttle Control o The throttle can be located sticking out of right side of the dash. It is an orange handled lever equipped with a turtle and a rabbit symbol. o Pulling down on the lever towards the rabbi t increases the amount of fuel fed into the engine and therefore increases RPM's and available power to the tractor. Clutch Pedal o This pedal is found on the left side of your foot controls. It is a single pedal. Forward and Reverse Pedal o This \"rocker\" pedal makes the tractor go forwards and backwards and can be found on the right side of your foot controls. It sits on the floor of the tractor. Brake Pedals o These pedals sit above the \"rocker\" pedal and can be operated as one pedal or split to brake th e individual rear wheels. Understanding the various parts of a small farm tractor and their functions PTO (power take off) o A PTO is used for powering a tiller, auger, or any other implement that is actively driven by the tractors engine. o The PTO can be located in the back of the tractor. o Hooking up the PTO drive shaft to the PTO and running the engine so the tachometer reads 540 RPM's use the PTO. o To engage the PTO the clutch must be depressed. Once the clutch is depressed you may shift the PTO lever f orward and then slowly release the clutch pedal to begin spinning the PTO. The lever can be found next to your right hip on the tractor. o It is important when engaging the PTO not to \"shock load.\" A \"shock load\" happens when the clutch is popped and the e ngine is revved to a running RPM level. \"Shock loading\" the PTO stresses the metal on the tractor and the implement being driven. To avoid this, run the tractor's engine with the lowest RPM's possible when taking your foot off the clutch and engaging the implement. Three -Point Hitch Hydraulic o The hydraulic unit and three -point hitch system is designed to raise and lower the implement positioned on the rear of the tractor. o The hydraulic is used to determine the operating depth of both active (PTO driven) and passive implements. This will determine the depth of tillage, subsoil ripping, plowing, etc of any given implement in use. o The lever that controls the three -point hitch can be found on the right side of the tractor driver's body around the height of the knee. o If the lever is pushed towards the ground at maximum depth the implement will be forced down as far as it may go by the hydraulics of the tractor. Front Bucket Loader o The front bucket loader is used for scooping large loads and moving heavy objects or masses of earth around the farm. o The front bucket loader is hydraulically operated using the ball lever located on the right hand side of the tractor directly across from the tractor driver's shoulder. o There are two different ranges of motion availa ble to you when using the front loader. o The arm of the bucket may be raised or lowered and the bucket may be tilted forward and backward. o The controls are \"reversed\" in that to make the arm of the bucket come up, you pull down on the ball lever. To lower the arm, you push up on the ball lever. o To dump the bucket, you move the ball lever to your right. To tilt the bucket back, you move the ball lever to your left. o These are the four main movements of the ball lever. Each movement is accomplished by moving the lever in the primary directions (north, south, east and west). o There are four other movements that incorporate both ranges of motion simultaneously. In other words, they move the arm and the bucket at the same time. These movements can be found by e ngaging the ball lever at the secondary directions (i.e., southwest, northeast, etc). These movements require more skill and experience and will make your movements more fluid. Basic Tractor Safety Principles Always wear your seatbelt! Most tractors are equipped with a roll over protection device that is built to protect you if the tractor rolls. A seatbelt will save you from getting crushed! Never stand near a spinning PTO! The PTO and connected drive shaft spins with incredible force. Keep clothi ng and body parts away from the spinning shaft, or risk dismemberment and death! Do not rest arms or hands in the joints of any hydraulic part! Or risk dismemberment. Never put your hands inside or around active implements when the tractor is running! Tu rn off tractor if any jamming or other obstructions occur when using PTO driven implements. Do not operate tractor on a dangerous slope! Be aware of rollover dangers. Always move very slowly when moving heavy loads in the bucket! Driving with a heavy load greatly changes the balance and stability of the tractor. Heavy loads encourage tipping and rolling. NOTES Transplanting (Field Topic) The purpose of this field topic is to gain a solid understanding of proper transplanting techniques, and in d oing so create the best environment for transplanted starts to thrive. Transition from greenhouse to field Starts grown i n a greenhouse are accustomed to a controlled environment. Air temperature, humidity, wind, soil temperature, and exposure to direct sunlight are all controlled factors in the greenhouse. Starts mu st have transition time fr om greenhouse to field. This process is called \"hardening off.\" H ardening off reduces amount of stress for start by gradually increasing amount of exposure to outside elements. Harde ning off should start at least 15 days prior to acceptable field transplant date. Thi s process can be done several ways: One good way is the use of a cold frame. A cold frame is a mini-greenhouse that is constructed using a wooden box with either a glass or plastic lid cover. Plants ca n ease out of a controlled gr eenhouse using the following schedule: \u00be First, th e plants are moved to the cold frame two weeks before they are ready to enter the field. \u00be Th e plants should spend these two weeks with the cover off the cold frame during the day and protected with th e cover on at night. \u00be Leave t he starts exposed to the elements for a half hour to an hour longer each consecutive day. \u00be Fi nally, leave them exposed all day and all night the final three days. \u00be Th e transition is complete. They are ready to go to the field. Transplanting Starts Star ts should be thoroughly watered before being transplanted. This greatly reduces shock. Using a weak fish emulsion solution just prior to transplant will also encourage plants to take off quickly. Keep starts i n shaded area until they enter the ground. Wh en pulling apart individual soil blocks or removing starts from trays, carefully separate the intertwined root growth, causing as little trauma as possible, while still remaining efficient. Do no t expose tender root systems to direct sun light (as little as fifteen seconds of exposure can kill off roots). Usi ng your hand or a planting tool create the right depth and size hole in the bed or row being planted. So me farmers will sprinkle a little organic fertilizer in the hole just prior to planting. This should be done only if the quality of the soil requires that extra boost. Gen tly tease the roots before planting the start; this encourages new outward growth of the roots. Take s pecial care to insure the top of the soil block or cell being planted is covered with native field soil; this greatly reduces the natural drying out process during the beginning of the plants field life. Some farmers apply a gentle amount of pressure to the base of transplants after planting; others allow the natural \"watering-in\" process to settle the soil around the new transplant. What works for one may not work for another, and much of that has to do with the style of irrigation being used. An overhead irrigation system is going settle the soil around the plant much better than a drip system. Using our drip system at Boones Farm we've found applying a gentle amount of pressure encourages the pooling of wate r around the base of the start. Al ways water in a new start. This is the highest preventative measure you can take against shock. Th e best time to transplant any start is in the c ool of the evening. This allows the plant a nice buffer to become acquainted with its new surroundings before dealing with a hot sun. TREE PLANTING (Field Exercise) Layout Consi der goals of tree planting - reforesta tion, food crop, windbreak, shade, etc. Consi der environmental factors - soil, climate, aspect, etc. Co nsider the needs and optimal conditions for the trees to be planted. Planting Bare root trees \u00be Di g hole - should be deeper and wider than roots \u00be Tr im off any broken roots \u00be Place roots i n hole. Ensure that tree is straight. Slowly fill the hole and gently tamp the soil in around the roots. \u00be Dept h of planting depends. Generally, in climates with a long wet season, the tree should be planted high - not in a basin - to ensure that the roots do not drown. A basin around the tree is helpful to capture and concentrate rainfall around the root zone, if the rain comes gradually over the course of the year. Po tted trees \u00be Dig hole - slightly bigger than the pot \u00be R emove tree from pot, and massage the potting soil so as to break compaction and offset any root binding. \u00be Place tree a nd soil into hole, slowly backf ill with native soil ar ound the potting soil, gently tamp. \u00be Dept h depends - see above. Irrigation Discu ss need for irrigation based on site specifics. Demo nstrate proper installation of drip irrigation. Mulching Di scuss pros and cons. \u00be Pro s - smothers weeds, conserves water, attracts earthworms. \u00be Cons - attracts mice, moles, and gophers. D emonstrate using straw or cardboard, or both. WEED MANAGEMENT (Field Exercise) Identification Tour fields and identify most common weeds (star thistle, pigweed, purslane, chicory, wild lettuce, grasses, etc.) Discuss why weeds are threatening to production - competition for water, nutrients in soil, light, etc. Pull or dig selected weeds and examine root system Management through manual cultivation Demonstrate and practice proper techniques with various tools - wheel hoe, stirrup hoe, collinear hoe, and Mexican hoe. Discuss need for follow-up cultivation. Benefits - eliminates weeds, stirs soil and break s crust (allows for easier penetration of air and water) "}
