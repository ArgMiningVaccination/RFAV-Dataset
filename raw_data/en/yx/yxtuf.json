Long-term PMvii Introduction We are now in our 25th edition of Nelson's Pediatric Antimicrobial Therapy, a tribute to John Nelson's belief that advice on treatment of children with infections should be clear and concise! Although no new oral anti-infective agents have been approved in the United States recently, several antibiotics in many classes that completed adult studies are now entering pediatric clinical trials, particularly those for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. The contributing editors, all very active in clinical work, have updates in their sections with relevant new recommendations based on current pub-lished data, guidelines, and clinical experience. We hope that the reference list for each chapter provides the available evidence to support our recommendations, for those who wish to see the data. For those who use the Nelson's app, you may have noticed a new \"feel\" to the app, which is now written in one of the Apple programing languages by Dr Howard Smart, a full-time office-based pediatrician and the chief of pediatrics at the Sharp Rees-Stealy multi-specialty medical group in San Diego, CA. With the support of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) (particularly Peter Lynch) and the editors, we are putting more of Howard's enhancements in this 2019 edition. So substantial are his contributions to the app, the book (from the perspective of an office-based pediatrician), and the develop- ment of future Nelson's digital versions that the editors and the AAP have unanimously asked Howard to join us officially as a contributing editor. We believe that his skills (clinical and digital) are an essential part of what we all hope the AAP Nelson's book can and should be. Recognizing the talent in collaborators/colleagues of the editors and their substantial and ongoing contributions to the quality of the material that is presented in this book, we wish to continue to acknowledge their advice each year in this Introduction. We con-tinue to receive valuable suggestions from Drs John van den Anker and Pablo Sanchez on antimicrobial therapy of the newborn, in support of the work done by JB Cantey and Jason Sauberan in Chapter 5. A pediatric hospital medicine consulting editor who is with us again this year is Dr Brian Williams, a pediatric/adult hospitalist who trained with us at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine/Rady Children's Hospital San Diego and is now in Madison, WI. His continuing advice on organizing information for both the book and the app has been invaluable. He is focused, practical, and very collaborative. We continue to harmonize the Nelson's book with Red Book: 2018-2021 Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases, 31st Edition (easy to understand, given that Dr David Kimberlin is also the editor of the Red Book). We are virtually always in sync but often with additional explanations (that do not necessarily represent AAP policy) to allow the reader to understand the basis for recommendations. ch00-Nelson-2019_FM_i-xii.indd 7 11/12/18 2:51 PMviii \u2014 Introduction We continue to provide grading of our recommendations\u2014our assessment of how strongly we feel about a recommendation and the strength of the evidence to support our recommendation (noted in the Table). Strength of Recommendation Description A Strongly recommended B Recommended as a good choice C One option for therapy that is adequate, perhaps among many other adequate therapies Level of Evidence Description I Based on well-designed, prospective, randomized, and controlled studies in an appropriate population of children II Based on data derived from prospectively collected, small comparative trials, or noncomparative prospective trials, or reasonable retrospective data from clinical trials in children, or data from other populations (eg, adults) III Based on case reports, case series, consensus statements, or expert opinion for situations in which sound data do not exist As we state each year, many of the recommendations by the editors for specific situations have not been systematically evaluated in controlled, prospective, comparative clinical trials. Many of the recommendations may be supported by published data, but the data may never have been presented to or reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, therefore, are not in the package label. We all find ourselves in this situation frequently. Many of us are working closely with the FDA to try to narrow the gap in our knowledge of antimicrobial agents between adults and children; the FDA pediatric infec-tious diseases staff is providing an exceptional effort to shed light on the doses that are safe and effective for neonates, infants, and children, with major efforts to place impor-tant new data on safety and efficacy in the antibiotic package labels for all to use in clini-cal practice. Barrett Winston, our primary AAP editorial contact for the past few years, has done an amazing job of organizing all the AAP staff, as well as the contributing and consulting editors, but has now moved to other responsibilities within the AAP and is turning over the editorial tasks to Mary Kelly, who has an impressive track record in publications. Mary will now keep us all moving forward with the 2019 edition upgrades and enhance-ments as we keep looking to the long-term future of the book in partnership with the ch00-Nelson-2019_FM_i-xii.indd 8 11/12/18 2:51 PMIntroduction \u2014 ix AAP. Peter Lynch continues to work on developing Nelson's online, as well as the app, and has shared considerable AAP resources with us. We continue to appreciate the teamwork of all those at the AAP who make sure this book gets to all the clinicians who may benefit. Thanks to Mark Grimes, vice president, Publishing, and our steadfast friends and supporters in AAP Membership, Marketing, and Publishing\u2014Jeff Mahony, director, professional and consumer publishing; Linda Smessaert, senior marketing manager, professional resources; and the entire staff\u2014who make certain that the consid-erable information in Nelson's makes it to those who are actually caring for children. We are still very interested to learn from readers/users if there are new chapters or sections you wish for us to develop\u2014and whether you find certain sections particularly helpful, so we don't change or delete them! From the feedback we have received, the chapter on adverse drug reactions is no longer included in this edition. We are focusing on more common antimicrobial drug issues, such as dosing in obesity.

Color has been added throughout to improve navigation and help you find the best treatment options quickly. Antimicrobials, Antifungals, Antivirals, and Antiparasitics Updates to tables for susceptibility of bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic pathogens. Tables are now color coded to make it easier to instantly find the best treatment options by pathogen. Presents new safety data on fluoroquinolones (including moxifloxacin) in children, supporting current policy that these drugs are appropriate for situations in which no other drug is active against the bacterial pathogen. Updates for doxycycline dosing, which has been converted to kilogram-based dosing to be consistent with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) package label dosing. Provides extensive explanations of the new beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations. At least 4 new antibiotics are under investigation in children, mostly for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. Specific, new, and evolving recommenda-tions about antifungal therapeutic drug levels for several invasive fungal infections are clarified, particularly in immunocompromised children. Adds Candida auris as a newly emergent fungal pathogen. Incorporates new coccidioidomycosis guidelines to updated recommendations. Includes new approaches to mucormycosis, a devastating infection, based on published data, animal models, and the extensive experience of William J. Steinbach, MD. Reorganizes antiviral table into 2 tables for easier reading: common viral pathogens are in one table, and HIV , hepatitis B, and hepatitis C are in a second table. Updates to babesiosis to include a recent publication supporting the choice of azithro-mycin and atovaquone for both mild to moderate and severe infection. Updates, including new information on drug therapy and steroid therapy, for neuro-cysticercosis incorporating the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene guidelines. Updates for Giardia , including tinidazole and nitazoxanide as drugs of choice, based on the IDSA guidelines for clinical management of diarrhea. ch00-Nelson-2019_FM_i-xii.indd 11 11/12/18 2:51 PM Updates for Chagas disease to include benznidazole, which was approved by the FDA for use in children 2 to 12 years of age and is no longer available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Nifurtimox continues to be available only through the CDC.

If there is no substantial benefit for efficacy or safety for one antimicrobial over another for the isolated or presumed bacte-rial pathogen(s), one should opt for using an older, more extensively used agent (with presumably better-defined efficacy and safety) that is usually less expensive and preferably with a narrower spectrum of activity. Beta-lactams and Beta-lactamase Inhibitors Beta-lactam (BL)/Beta-lactamase Inhibitor (BLI) Combinations. Increasingly studied and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are BL/BLI combinations that target antibiotic resistance based on the presence of a pathogen's beta-lactamase. The BL antibiotic may demonstrate activity against a pathogen, but if a beta-lactamase is present in that pathogen, it will hydrolyze the BL ring structure and inactivate the antibiotic. The BLI is usually a BL structure, which explains why it binds readily to certain beta-lactamases and can inhibit their activity; however, the BLI usually does not demonstrate direct antibiotic activity itself. As amoxicillin and ampicillin were used extensively against Haemophilus influenzae following their approval, resistance to both antibiotics increased, based on the presence of a beta-lactamase that hydrolyzes the BL ring of amoxicillin/ampicillin (up to 40% resistance in some regions). Clavulanate, a BLI that binds to and inactivates the beta-lactamase, allows amoxicillin/ampicillin to \"survive\" and inhibit cell wall formation, leading to the death of the organism. The oral BL/BLI combination of amoxicillin/clavulanate, originally known as Augmentin, has been very effective. Similar combinations, primarily intravenous (IV), have now been studied, pair - ing penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems with other BLIs such as tazobactam, sulbactam, and avibactam. Under investigation the oral cephalosporins have the advantage over oral penicillins of somewhat greater spectrum of activity. The serum half-lives of cefpodoxime, ceftibuten, and cefixime are greater than 2 hours. This pharmacokinetic feature accounts for the fact that they may be given in 1 or 2 doses per day for certain indications, particularly otitis media, where the middle ear fluid half-life is likely to be much longer than the serum half-life. For more resistant pathogens, twice daily is preferred (see Chapter 3). The spectrum of activity increases for ch01-Nelson-2019_001-008.indd 1 11/7/18 8:30 AMChoosing Among Antibiotics Within and Beta-lactamase Inhibitors, Macrolides, Aminoglycosides, and Fluoroquinolones2 \u2014 Chapter 1. Choosing Among Antibiotics Within a Class: Beta-lactams and Beta-lactamase Inhibitors, Macrolides, Aminoglycosides, and Fluoroquinolones the first-generation cephalosporins (cepha- lexin and cefadroxil), to the second cefuroxime) that demonstrates activity against Haemophilus influenzae producing to the third-generation agents (cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime, and ceftibuten) coli, Klebsiella spp). However, ceftibuten and cefixime, in particular, have a disadvantage of less activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae than the others, particu- larly against fifth-generation cephalosporins (see the Parenteral Cephalosporins section) currently exist (no activ- ity against Pseudomonas or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]). The palatability of generic versions of these products may not have the same better-tasting characteristics as the original products. Parenteral Cephalosporins. First-generation cephalosporins, such as cefazolin, are used mainly for treatment of Gram-positive infections caused by S aureus (excluding MRSA) and group A streptococcus and for surgical prophylaxis; the Gram-negative spectrum is limited but more extensive than ampicillin. Cefazolin is well tolerated on intramuscular or IV injection. second-generation cephalosporin (cefuroxime) and the cephamycins (cefoxitin and cefotetan) provide increased activity against many Gram-negative organisms, particularly Haemophilus and E coli . Cefoxitin has, in addition, activity against approximately 80% of strains of Bacteroides fragilis and can be considered for use in place of the more active agents, like metronidazole or carbapenems, when that organism is implicated in nonseri-ous disease. Third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, enteric Gram-negative bacilli. As with all cephalosporins, at readily achievable serum concentrations, they are less active against enterococci and Listeria; only ceftazidime has significant activity against Pseudomonas. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone have been used very successfully to treat meningitis caused by pneumococ-cus (mostly penicillin-susceptible strains), H influenzae type b, meningococcus, and susceptible strains of E coli meningitis. These drugs have the greatest usefulness for treat- ing Gram-negative bacillary infections due to their safety, compared with other classes of antibiotics (including aminoglycosides). Because ceftriaxone is excreted, to a large extent, via the liver, it can be used with little dosage adjustment in patients with renal failure. With a serum half-life of 4 to 7 hours, it can be given once a day for all infections, includ- ing meningitis, that are caused by susceptible organisms. Cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin approved for use in children in 1999, exhibits (1) enhanced antipseudomonal activity over ceftazidime; (2) the Gram-positive activity of second-generation cephalosporins; (3) better activity against Gram-negative bacilli; against of Entero - bacter Citrobacter ) that can hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins. It can be used as single-drug antibiotic against ch01-Nelson-2019_001-008.indd 2 11/7/18 8:30 AM2019 Nelson's Pediatric Antimicrobial Therapy \u2014 1Choosing Class: and Beta-lactamase Inhibitors, Macrolides, Aminoglycosides, and Fluoroquinolones these pathogens, rather than paired with an aminoglycoside, as is commonly done with third-generation cephalosporins to decrease the emergence of ampC-resistant clones. Ceftaroline is a fift h-generation cephalosporin, the the cephalosporins with activ- ity against MRSA. Ceftaroline was approved by the FDA in December 2010 for adults and approved for children in June 2016 for treatment of complicated skin infections (including MRSA) and community-acquired pneumonia. The pharmacokinetics of cef- taroline have been evaluated in all pediatric age groups, including neonates and children with cystic fibrosis; clinical studies for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin infection have now been published. 1 Based on these published data, review by the FDA, and post-marketing experience for infants and children 2 months and older, ceftaroline should be as effective and safer than vancomycin for treatment of MRSA infections. Just as BLs are preferred over vancomycin for methicillin-susceptible S aureus infections, ceftaroline should be considered preferred treatment over vancomy- cin for MRSA infection. Neither renal function nor drug levels need to be followed with ceftaroline to the beta-lactamase produced by S aureus in this case and not those produced by Gram-negative bacteria. These anti-biotics are active against penicillin-resistant S aureus but not against MRSA. Nafcillin differs pharmacologically from the others in being excreted primarily by the liver rather than by the kidneys, which may explain the relative lack of nephrotoxicity compared with methicillin, which is no longer available in the United States. Nafcillin pharmacokinetics are erratic in persons with liver disease, and the drug is often painful with IV infusion. The BLI (clavulanic acid, tazobac-tam, or avibactam in these combinations) binds irreversibly to and neutralizes specific beta- lactamase enzymes produced by the organism. The combination only adds to the spectrum of the original antibiotic when the mechanism of resistance is a beta- lactamase enzyme and only when the BLI is capable of binding to and inhibiting that particular organism's beta-lactamase enzyme(s). The combinations extend the spectrum of activity of the primary antibiotic to include many beta-lactamase-positive bacteria, including some strains of enteric Gram-negative bacilli (E coli, Klebsiella, and and and may still be inactive against Pseudomonas because their BLIs may not effectively inhibit all the many relevant beta-lactamases of Pseudomonas. Pseudomonas has an intrinsic capacity to develop resistance following exposure to any BL, based on the activity of several inducible chromosomal beta-lactamases, upregulated efflux pumps, and changes in the permeability of the cell wall, as well as mutational changes in the antibacterial target sites. Because development of resistance during therapy ch01-Nelson-2019_001-008.indd 3 11/7/18 8:30 AMChoosing Among Antibiotics Within and Beta-lactamase Inhibitors, Macrolides, Aminoglycosides, and Fluoroquinolones4 \u2014 Chapter 1. Choosing Among Antibiotics Within a Class: Beta-lactams and Beta-lactamase Inhibitors, Macrolides, Aminoglycosides, and Fluoroquinolones 1 not uncommon (particularly beta-lactamase-mediated resistance against piperacillin or ceftazidime), an aminoglycoside such as tobramycin is often used in combination, assuming that the tobramycin may kill strains developing resistance to the BLs. Cefepime, meropenem, and imipenem are relatively stable to the beta-lactamases induced while on therapy and can be used as single-agent therapy for most Pseudomonas infections, but resistance may still develop to these agents based on other mechanisms of resistance. For Pseudomonas infections in compromised hosts or in life-threatening infections, these drugs, too, should be used in combination with an aminoglycoside or a second active agent. The benefits of the additional antibiotic should be weighed against the potential for additional toxicity and alteration of host flora. Aminopenicillins (amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate [oral formulations only, and ampicillin/sulbactam [parenteral only]). Amoxicillin is very well absorbed, good tasting, and associated with very few side effects. Augmentin is a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate (as noted previously) that is available in several fixed proportions that permit amoxicillin to remain active against many beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, including H influenzae and S aureus (but not MRSA). Amoxicillin/clavulanate has undergone many changes in formulation since its introduction. The ratio of amoxicillin to clavulanate was originally 4:1, based on susceptibility data of pneumococcus and Haemophilus during the 1970s. With the emergence of penicillin-resistant pneumococcus, recommendations for increasing the dosage of amoxicillin, particularly for upper respiratory tract infections, were made. However, if one increases the dosage of clavulanate even slightly, the incidence of diarrhea increases dramatically. If one keeps the dosage of clavulanate constant while increasing the dosage of amoxicillin, one can treat the relatively resistant pneumococci while not increasing gastrointestinal side effects of the combination. The original 4:1 ratio is present in suspensions containing 125-mg and 250-mg amoxicillin/5 mL and the 125-mg and 250-mg chewable tablets. A higher 7:1 ratio is present in the suspensions containing 200-mg and 400-mg amoxicillin/5 mL and in the 200-mg and 400-mg chewable tablets. A still higher ratio of 14:1 is present in the suspension formulation Augmentin ES-600 that contains 600-mg amoxicillin/5 mL; this preparation is designed to deliver 90 mg/kg/day of amoxicillin, divided twice daily, for the treatment of ear (and sinus) infections. The high serum and middle ear fluid concentrations achieved with 45 mg/kg/dose, combined with the long middle ear fluid half-life (4-6 hours) of amoxicillin, allow for a therapeutic antibiotic exposure to pathogens in the middle ear with a twice-daily regimen. However, the prolonged half-life in the middle ear fluid is not necessarily found in other infection sites (eg, skin, lung tissue, joint tissue), for which dosing of amoxicillin and Augmentin should continue to be 3 times daily for most susceptible pathogens. For older children who can swallow tablets, the amoxicillin to clavulanate ratios are as with ampicillin in the parenteral formulation Unasyn. The cautions regarding spectrum of activity for piperacillin/ tazobactam with respect to the limitations of the BLI in increasing the spectrum of ch01-Nelson-2019_001-008.indd 4 11/7/18 8:30 AM2019 Nelson's Pediatric Antimicrobial Therapy \u2014 1Choosing Class: Beta-lactams and Beta-lactamase Inhibitors, Macrolides, Aminoglycosides, and Fluoroquinolones activity also apply to ampicillin/sulbactam, in which ampicillin does not even have the extended activity against the enteric bacilli seen ertapenem are carbapen - ems with a broader spectrum of activity than any other class of BL currently available. Meropenem, imipenem, and ertapenem are approved by the FDA for use in children. At present, we recommend them for treatment of infections caused by bacteria resistant to standard therapy or for mixed infections involving aerobes and anaerobes. Imipenem has greater central nervous system (CNS) irritability compared with other carbapenems, leading to an increased risk of seizures in children with meningitis, but this is not clini-cally significant in children without underlying CNS inflammation. Meropenem was not associated with an increased rate of seizures, compared with cefotaxime in children with meningitis. Imipenem and meropenem are active against virtually all coliform bacilli, including cefotaxime-resistant (extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or ampC-producing) strains, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (including most ceftazidime- resistant strains), and against anaerobes, including B fragilis. While ertapenem lacks the excellent activity against P aeruginosa of the other carbapenems, it has the advantage of a prolonged serum half-life, which allows for once-daily dosing in adults and children aged 13 years and older and twice-daily dosing in younger children. Newly emergent strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae contain K pneumoniae carbapenemases that degrade and inactivate all the carbapenems. These strains, as well as strains carrying the less common New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase, which is also active against carbapenems, have begun to spread to many parts of the world, reinforcing the need to keep track of your local antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Carbapenems that have been paired with BLIs, as noted previously, may only inhibit one type of carbapenemase. Macrolides Erythromycin is the prototype of macrolide antibiotics. Almost 30 macrolides have been produced, but only 3 are FDA approved for children in the United States: erythromycin, azithromycin (also called an azalide), and clarithromycin, while a fourth, telithromycin (also called a ketolide), is approved for adults and only available in tablet form. As a class, these drugs achieve greater concentrations intracellularly than in serum, particularly with azithromycin and clarithromycin. As a result, measuring serum concentrations is usually not clinically useful. Gastrointestinal intolerance to erythromycin is caused by the breakdown products of the macrolide ring structure. This is much less of a problem with azithromycin and clarithromycin. Azithromycin, clarithromycin, and telithromycin extend the erythromycin to include Haemophilus; azithro- mycin and clarithromycin also have substantial activity against certain mycobacteria. Azithromycin is also active in vitro and effective against many enteric Gram-negative pathogens, including Salmonella and Shigella. Aminoglycosides Although 5 aminoglycoside antibiotics are available in the United States, only 3 are widely used for systemic therapy of aerobic Gram-negative infections and for synergy ch01-Nelson-2019_001-008.indd 5 11/7/18 8:30 AMChoosing Among Antibiotics Within and Beta-lactamase Inhibitors, Macrolides, Aminoglycosides, and Fluoroquinolones6 \u2014 Chapter 1. Choosing Among Antibiotics Within a Class: Beta-lactams and Beta-lactamase Inhibitors, Macrolides, Aminoglycosides, and Fluoroquinolones gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. Streptomycin and kanamycin have more limited utility due to increased toxicity compared with the other agents. Resistance in Gram-negative bacilli to aminoglycosides is caused by bacterial enzymes that adenylate, acetylate, or phosphory-late the aminoglycoside, resulting in inactivity. The specific activities of each enzyme against each aminoglycoside in each pathogen are highly variable. As a result, antibiotic susceptibility tests must be done for each aminoglycoside drug separately. There are small differences in toxicities to the kidneys and eighth cranial nerve hearing/vestibular func-tion, although it is uncertain whether these small differences are clinically significant. For all children receiving a full treatment course, it is advisable to monitor peak and trough serum concentrations early in the course of therapy, as the degree of drug exposure correlates with toxicity and elevated trough concentrations may predict impending drug accumulation. With amikacin, desired peak concentrations are 20 to 35 mcg/mL and trough drug concentrations are less than 10 mcg/mL; for gentamicin and tobramycin, depending on the frequency of dosing, peak concentrations should be 5 to 10 mcg/mL and trough concentrations less than 2 mcg/mL. Children with cystic fibrosis require greater dosages to achieve equivalent therapeutic serum concentrations due to enhanced clearance. Inhaled tobramycin has been very successful in children with cystic fibrosis as an adjunctive therapy of Gram-negative bacillary infections. of inhaled amino-glycosides in other Gram-negative pneumonias (eg, ventilator-associated pneumonia) Once-daily gen- tamicin or tobramycin has been studied in adults and in some neonates and children; peak serum concentrations are greater than those achieved with dosing 3 times daily. Aminoglycosides demonstrate concentration-dependent killing of pathogens, suggesting a potential benefit to higher serum concentrations achieved with once-daily dosing. Regi-mens giving the daily dosage as a single infusion, rather than as traditionally split doses every 8 hours, are effective and safe for normal adult hosts and immune-compromised hosts with fever and neutropenia and may be less toxic. Experience with once-daily dos-ing in children is increasing, with similar encouraging results as noted for adults. A recent Cochrane review for children (and adults) with cystic fibrosis comparing once-daily with 3-times-daily administration found equal efficacy with decreased toxicity in children. 2 Once-daily dosing should be considered as effective as multiple, smaller doses per day and is likely to be safer for children; therefore, it should be the preferred regimen for treatment. Fluoroquinolones More than 40 years ago, fluoroquinolone (FQ) toxicity to cartilage in weight-bearing joints in experimental juvenile animals was documented to be dose and duration of therapy dependent. Pediatric studies were, therefore, not initially undertaken with ciprofloxacin or other FQs. However, with increasing antibiotic resistance in pediatric pathogens and an accumulating database in pediatrics suggesting that joint toxicity may be uncommon, the FDA allowed prospective studies to proceed in 1998. As of July 2018, ch01-Nelson-2019_001-008.indd 6 11/7/18 8:30 AM2019 Nelson's Pediatric Antimicrobial Therapy \u2014 1Choosing Class: Beta-lactams and Beta-lactamase Inhibitors, Macrolides, Aminoglycosides, and Fluoroquinolones no cases of documented FQ-attributable joint toxicity have occurred in children with FQs that are approved for use in the United States. Limited published data are available from prospective, blinded studies to accurately assess this risk, although some uncontrolled retrospective published data are reassuring. A prospective, randomized, double-blind study of moxifloxacin for intra-abdominal infection, with 1-year follow-up specifically designed to assess tendon/joint toxicity, demonstrated no concern for toxicity. 3 Unblinded studies with levofloxacin for respiratory tract infections and unpublished randomized studies comparing ciprofloxacin versus other agents for complicated urinary tract infec-tion suggest the possibility of an uncommon, reversible, FQ-attributable arthralgia, but these data should be interpreted with caution. The use of FQs in situations of antibiotic resistance where no other active agent is available is reasonable, weighing the benefits of treatment against the low risk of toxicity of this class of antibiotics. The use of an oral FQ in situations in which the only alternative is parenteral therapy is also justified. 4 Ciprofloxacin usually has very good Gram-negative activity (with great regional variation in susceptibility) against enteric bacilli (E coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella ) and against P aeruginosa. However, it lacks substantial Gram-positive coverage and should not be used to treat streptococcal, staphylococcal, or pneumococcal infec-tions. Newer-generation FQs are more active against these pathogens; levofloxacin has documented efficacy and safety in pediatric clinical trials for respiratory tract infections, acute otitis media, and community-acquired pneumonia. Children with any question of joint/tendon/bone toxicity in the levofloxacin studies were followed up to 5 years after treatment, with no difference in outcomes in these randomized studies, compared with the standard FDA-approved antibiotics used in these studies. 5 None of the newer- generation FQs are significantly more active against Gram-negative pathogens than ciprofloxacin. Quinolone antibiotics are bitter tasting. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are currently available in a suspension form; ciprofloxacin is FDA approved in pediatrics for complicated urinary tract infections and inhalation anthrax, while levofloxacin is approved for inhalation anthrax only, as the sponsor chose not to apply for approval for pediatric respiratory tract infections. For reasons of safety and to prevent the emergence of widespread resistance, FQs should still not be used for primary therapy of pediatric infections and should be limited to situations in which safe and effective oral therapy with other classes of antibiotics does not exist. ch01-Nelson-2019_001-008.indd 7 11/7/18 8:30 AMch01-Nelson-2019_001-008.indd 8 11/7/18 8:30 AM2019 and Echinocandins Separating antifungal agents by class, much like navigating the myriad of antibacte- rial agents, allows one to best understand the underlying mechanisms of action and then appropriately choose which agent would be optimal for empirical therapy or a targeted approach. There are certain helpful generalizations that should be considered; for example, echinocandins are fungicidal against yeasts and fungistatic against molds, while azoles are the opposite. Coupled with these concepts is the need for continued surveillance for fungal epidemiology and resistance patterns. While some fungal species are inherently or very often resistant to specific agents or even classes, there are also an increasing number of fungal isolates that are developing resistance due to environmental pressure or chronic use in individual patients. Additionally, new (often resistant) fungal species emerge that deserve special attention, such as Candida auris, which can be multi- drug resistant. In 2019, there are 14 individual antifungal agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for systemic use, and several more in development. This chapter will focus only on the most commonly used systemic agents and will not highlight the many anticipated new agents until they are approved for use in patients. For each agent, there are sometimes several formulations, each with unique pharmacokinetics that one must understand to optimize the agent, particularly in patients who are critically ill. Therefore, it is more important than ever to establish a firm foundation in understand-ing how these antifungal agents work to optimize pharmacokinetics and where they work best to target fungal pathogens most appropriately. Polyenes Amphotericin B (AmB) is a polyene antifungal antibiotic that has been available since 1958. A Streptomyces species, isolated from the soil in Venezuela, produced 2 antifungals whose names originated from the drug's amphoteric property of reacting as an acid as well as a base. Amphotericin A was not as active as AmB, so only AmB is used clinically. Nystatin is another polyene antifungal, but, due to systemic toxicity, it is only used in topi-cal preparations. AmB remains the most broad-spectrum antifungal available for clinical use. This lipophilic drug binds to ergosterol, the major sterol in the fungal cell membrane, and creates transmembrane pores that compromise the integrity of the cell membrane and create a rapid fungicidal effect through osmotic lysis. Toxicity is likely due to the cross-reactivity with the human cholesterol bi-lipid membrane, which resembles ergos- terol. The toxicity of the conventional formulation, AmB deoxycholate (AmB-D)\u2014the parent molecule coupled with an ionic detergent for clinical use\u2014can be substantial from the standpoints of systemic reactions (fever, rigors) and acute and chronic renal toxicity. Premedication with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and meperidine has historically been used to prevent systemic reactions during infusion. Renal dysfunction manifests primarily as decreased glomerular filtration with a rising serum creatinine concentra-tion, but substantial tubular nephropathy is associated with potassium and magnesium wasting, requiring supplemental potassium for many neonates and children, regardless ch02-Nelson-2019_009-016.indd 9 10/1/18 12:06 PM10 \u2014 2. Choosing and Echinocandins2 of clinical symptoms associated with infusion. Fluid loading with saline pre- and post- AmB-D infusion seems to mitigate renal toxicity. Three lipid preparations approved in the mid-1990s decrease toxicity with no apparent decrease in clinical efficacy. Decisions on which lipid AmB preparation to use should, therefore, largely focus on side effects and costs. Two clinically useful lipid formulations exist: one in which ribbonlike lipid complexes of AmB are created (amphotericin B lipid complex [ABLC]), Abelcet, and one in which AmB is incorporated into true liposomes (liposomal amphotericin B [L-AmB]), AmBisome. The classic clinical dosage used of these preparations is 5 mg/kg/day, in contrast to the 1 mg/kg/day of AmB-D. In most studies, the side effects of L-AmB were somewhat less than those of ABLC, but both have significantly fewer side effects than AmB-D. The advantage of the lipid preparations is the ability to safely deliver a greater overall dose of the parent AmB drug. The cost of conventional AmB-D is substantially less than either lipid formulation. A colloidal disper - sion of AmB in cholesteryl sulfate, Amphotec, which is no longer available in the United States, with decreased nephrotoxicity but infusion-related side effects, is closer to AmB-D than to the lipid formulations and precludes recommendation for its use. The decreased nephrotoxicity of the 3 lipid preparations is thought to be due to the preferential binding of its AmB to high-density lipoproteins, compared with AmB-D binding to low-density lipoproteins. Despite in vitro concentration-dependent killing, a clinical trial comparing L-AmB at doses of 3 mg/kg/day versus 10 mg/kg/day found no efficacy benefit for the higher dose and only greater toxicity. 1 Recent pharmacokinetic analyses of L-AmB found that while children receiving L-AmB at lower doses exhibit linear pharmacokinetics, a significant proportion of children receiving L-AmB at daily doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics with significantly higher peak concentrations and some toxicity. 2,3 Therefore, it is generally not recommended to use any lipid AmB prepara- tions at very high dosages (. 5 mg/kg/day), as it will likely only incur greater toxicity with no real therapeutic advantage. There are reports of using higher dosing in very difficult infections where a lipid AmB formulation is the first-line therapy (eg, mucormycosis), and while experts remain divided on this practice, it is clear that at least 5 mg/kg/day of a lipid AmB formulation should be used. AmB has a long terminal half-life and, coupled with the concentration-dependent killing, the agent is best used as single daily doses. These pharmacokinetics explain the use in some studies of once-weekly, or even once every 2 weeks, 4 AmB for antifungal prophylaxis or preemptive therapy, albeit with mixed clinical results. If the overall AmB exposure needs to be decreased due to toxicity, it is best to increase the dosing interval (eg, 3 times weekly) but retain the full mg/kg dose for optimal pharmacokinetics. AmB-D has been used for nonsystemic purposes, in bladder washes, intraven- tricular instillation, intrapleural instillation, and other modalities, but there are no firm data supporting those clinical indications, and it is likely that the local toxicities outweigh the theoretic benefits. One exception is aerosolized AmB for antifungal prophylaxis (not treatment) in lung transplant recipients due to the different pathophysiology of invasive aspergillosis (often originating at the bronchial anastomotic site, more so than ch02-Nelson-2019_009-016.indd 10 10/1/18 12:06 PM2019 Nelson's Pediatric Polyenes, Azoles, and Echinocandins2 parenchymal disease) in that specific patient population. Due to the lipid chemistry, the L-AmB does not interact well with renal tubules and L-AmB is recovered from the urine at lower levels than AmB-D, so there is a theoretic concern with using a lipid formulation, as opposed to AmB-D, when treating isolated urinary fungal disease. This theoretic concern is likely outweighed by the real concern of toxicity with AmB-D. Most experts believe AmB-D should be reserved for use in resource-limited settings in which no alternative agents (eg, lipid formulations) are available. An exception is in neonates, where limited retrospective data suggest that the AmB-D formulation had better efficacy for invasive candidiasis. 5 Importantly, there are several pathogens that are inherently or functionally resistant to AmB, including lusitaniae, This class of systemic agents was first approved in 1981 and is divided into the number of nitrogen atoms in the azole ring. All the azoles work for cell membrane integrity. While the polyenes are rapidly fungicidal, the azoles are fungistatic against yeasts and fungicidal against molds. However, it is important to note that ketoconazole and fluconazole have no mold activity. The only systemic imidazole is ketoconazole, which is primarily active against Candida spp and is available in an oral formulation. Three azoles (itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole) need therapeutic drug monitor - ing with trough levels within the first 4 to 7 days (when patient is at pharmacokinetic steady state); it is unclear at present if isavuconazole will require drug-level monitoring. It is less clear if therapeutic drug monitoring is required during primary azole prophy-laxis, although low levels have been associated with a higher probability of breakthrough infection. Fluconazole is active against a broader range of fungi than ketoconazole and includes clinically relevant activity against Cryptococcus, Coccidioides, and Histoplasma. The pediatric treatment dose is 12 mg/kg/day, which targets exposures that are observed in critically ill adults who receive 800 mg of fluconazole per day. Like most other azoles, fluconazole requires a loading dose on the first day, and this approach is routinely used in adult patients. A loading dose of 25 mg/kg on the first day has been nicely studied in infants 6 and is likely also beneficial, but has not been definitively studied yet, in all children. The exception is children on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, for whom, because of the higher volume of distribution, a higher loading dose (35 mg/kg) is required to achieve comparable exposure. 7 Fluconazole achieves relatively high concentrations in urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared with AmB due to its low lipophilicity, with urinary concentrations often so high that treatment against even \"resistant\" pathogens that are isolated only in the urine is possible. Fluconazole remains one of the most active and, so far, one of the safest systemic antifungal agents for the treatment of most Candida ch02-Nelson-2019_009-016.indd 11 10/1/18 12:06 PM12 \u2014 to fluconazole, although tance is increasingly present in many non-albicans Candida spp as well as in C albicans in children repeatedly exposed to fluconazole. For instance, Candida krusei is considered inherently voriconazole), Candida tropicalis is developing more resistant strains, and the newly identified Candida auris is generally fluconazole resistant. Fluconazole is available in parenteral and oral (with . 90% bioavailability) formulations and toxicity is unusual and primarily hepatic. Itraconazole is active against an even broader range of fungi and, unlike fluconazole, includes molds such as Aspergillus. It is currently available as a capsule or oral solution (the intravenous [IV] form was discontinued); the oral solution provides approximately 30% higher and more consistent serum concentrations than capsules and should be used preferentially. Absorption using itraconazole oral solution is improved on an empty stomach and not influenced by gastric pH (unlike the capsule form, which is best admin-istered under fed conditions or with a more acidic cola beverage to increase absorption), and monitoring itraconazole serum concentrations, like most azole antifungals, is a key principal in management (generally, itraconazole serum trough levels should be 1-2 mcg/mL; trough levels . 5 mcg/mL may be associated with increased toxicity). Concentrations should be checked after 5 days of therapy to ensure adequate drug exposure. When mea-sured by high-pressure liquid chromatography, itraconazole and its bioactive hydroxy-itraconazole metabolite are reported, the sum of which should be considered in assessing drug levels. In adult patients, itraconazole is recommended to be loaded at 200 mg twice daily for 2 days, followed by 200 mg daily starting on the third day. Loading dose studies have not been performed in children. Dosing itraconazole in children requires twice-daily dosing throughout treatment, compared with once-daily maintenance dosing in adults, and the key to treatment success is following drug levels. Limited pharmacokinetic data are available in children; itraconazole has not been approved by the FDA for pediatric indications. Itraconazole is indicated in adults for therapy of mild/moderate disease with blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, and others. Although it possesses antifungal activity, itra-conazole is not indicated as primary therapy against invasive aspergillosis, as voriconazole is a far superior option. Itraconazole is not active against Zygomycetes (eg, mucormyco - sis). Toxicity in adults is primarily hepatic. Voriconazole was approved in 2002 and is only FDA approved for children 12 years and older, although there are now substantial pharmacokinetic data and experience for chil- dren aged 2 to 12 years. 8 Voriconazole is a fluconazole derivative, so think of it as having the greater tissue and CSF penetration of fluconazole but the added antifungal spectrum to include molds. While the bioavailability of voriconazole in adults is approximately 96%, multiple studies have shown that it is only approximately 50% to 60% in children, requir - ing clinicians to carefully monitor voriconazole trough concentrations in patients taking the oral formulation, further complicated by great inter-patient variability in clearance. Voriconazole serum concentrations are tricky to interpret, but monitoring concentra-tions is essential to using this drug, like all azole antifungals, and especially important in ch02-Nelson-2019_009-016.indd 12 10/1/18 12:06 PM2019 Nelson's Pediatric Antifungal Agents: Polyenes, Azoles, and Echinocandins2 circumstances of suspected treatment failure or possible toxicity. Most experts suggest voriconazole trough concentrations of 2 mcg/mL (at a minimum, 1 mcg/mL) or greater, which would generally exceed the pathogen's minimum inhibitory concentration, but, generally, toxicity will not be seen until concentrations of approximately 6 mcg/mL or greater. Trough levels should be monitored 2 to 5 days after initiation of therapy and repeated the following week to confirm the patient remains in the therapeutic range or repeated 4 days after change of dose. One important point is the acquisition of an accurate trough concentration, one obtained just before the next dose is due and not obtained through a catheter infusing the drug. These simple trough parameters will make interpretation possible. The fundamental voriconazole pharmacokinetics are different in adults versus children; in adults, voriconazole is metabolized in a nonlinear fashion, whereas in children, the drug is metabolized in a linear fashion. This explains the increased pediatric starting dosing for voriconazole at 9 mg/kg/dose versus loading with 6 mg/kg/dose in adult patients. Y ounger children, especially those younger than 3 years, require even higher dosages of voriconazole and also have a larger therapeutic window for dosing. However, many studies have shown an inconsistent relationship, on a population level, between dosing and levels, highlighting the need for close monitor - ing after the initial dosing scheme and then dose adjustment as needed in the individual patient. For children younger than 2 years, some have proposed 3-times-daily dosing to achieve sufficient serum levels. 9 Given the poor clinical and microbiological response of Aspergillus infections to AmB, voriconazole is now the treatment of choice for invasive aspergillosis and many other invasive mold infections (eg, pseudallescheriasis, fusariosis). Importantly, infections zole. Voriconazole retains against most Candida spp, including some that are fluconazole resistant, but it is unlikely to replace fluconazole for treatment of fluconazole-susceptible Candida infections. Importantly, there are increasing reports of C glabrata resistance to voriconazole. Voriconazole produces some unique transient visual field abnormalities in about 10% of adults and children. There are an increasing number of reports, seen in as high as 20% of patients, of a photosensitive sunburn-like erythema that is not aided by sunscreen (only sun avoidance). In some rare long-term (mean of 3 years of therapy) cases, this voriconazole phototoxicity has developed into cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Discontinuing voriconazole is recommended in patients experiencing chronic phototoxicity. The rash is the most common indication for switching from vori-conazole to posaconazole/isavuconazole if a triazole antifungal is required. Hepatotoxicity is uncommon, occurring only in 2% to 5% of patients. Voriconazole is CYP metabolized (CYP2C19), and allelic polymorphisms in the population could lead to personalized dosing. 10 Results have shown that some Asian patients will achieve higher toxic serum concentrations than other patients. Voriconazole also interacts with many similarly P450 metabolized drugs to produce some profound changes in serum concentrations of many concurrently administered drugs. Posaconazole, an itraconazole derivative, was FDA approved in 2006 as an oral suspension for adolescents 13 years and older. An extended-release tablet formulation was approved in November 2013, also for adolescents 13 years and older, and an IV ch02-Nelson-2019_009-016.indd 13 10/1/18 12:06 PM14 \u2014 Chapter 2. Choosing and Echinocandins2 formulation was approved in March 2014 for patients 18 years and older. Effective absorp- tion of the oral suspension strongly requires taking the medication with food, ideally a high-fat meal; taking posaconazole on an empty stomach will result in approximately one-fourth of the absorption as in the fed state. The tablet formulation has significantly better absorption due to its delayed release in the small intestine, but absorption will still be slightly increased with food. If the patient can take the (relatively large) tablets, the extended-release tablet is the preferred form due to the ability to easily obtain higher and more consistent drug levels. Due to the low pH (, 5) of IV posaconazole, a central venous catheter is required for administration. The IV formulation contains only slightly lower amounts of the cyclodextrin vehicle than voriconazole, so similar theoretic renal accumulation concerns exist. The exact pediatric dosing for posaconazole has not been completely determined and requires consultation with a pediatric infectious diseases expert. The pediatric oral suspension dose recommended by some experts for treating invasive disease is at least 18 mg/kg/day divided 3 times daily, but the true answer is likely higher and serum trough level monitoring is recommended. A study with a new pediatric formulation for suspension, essentially the tablet form that is able to be suspended, has recently been completed, and results are pending. Importantly, the current tablet cannot be broken for use due to its chemical coating. Pediatric dosing with the current IV or extended-release tablet dosing is completely unknown, but adolescents can likely follow the adult dosing schemes. In adult patients, IV posaconazole is loaded at 300 mg twice daily on the first day, and then 300 mg once daily starting on the second day. Similarly, in adult patients, the extended-release tablet is dosed as 300 mg twice daily on the first day, and then 300 mg once daily starting on the second day. In adult patients, the maximum amount of posaconazole oral suspension given is 800 mg per day due to its excretion, and that has been given as 400 mg twice daily or 200 mg 4 times a day in severely ill patients due to saturable absorption and findings of a marginal increase in exposure with more frequent dosing. Greater than 800 mg per day is not indicated in any patient. Like voriconazole and itraconazole, trough levels should be monitored, and most experts feel that posaconazole levels for treatment should be greater than or equal to 1 mcg/mL (and greater than 0.7 mcg/mL for prophylaxis). Monitor posaconazole trough levels 5 days after initiation of therapy. The in vitro activity of posaconazole against Candida spp is better than that of fluconazole and similar to voriconazole. Overall in vitro antifungal activity against Aspergillus is also equivalent to voriconazole, but, notably, it is the first triazole with substantial activity against some Zygomycetes, including Rhizopus spp and Mucor spp, as well and Blastomyces and the pathogens of phaeohyphomycosis. Posaconazole treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients with chronic granulomatous disease appears to be superior to voriconazole in this specific patient population for an unknown reason. Posaconazole is eliminated by hepatic glucuronidation but does demonstrate inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme system, leading to many drug interactions with other P450 metabolized drugs. It is currently approved for prophylaxis of Candida and Aspergillus infections in high-risk adults and for treatment of Candida oropharyngeal disease or esophagitis in adults. Posaconazole, like itraconazole, has generally poor CSF penetration. ch02-Nelson-2019_009-016.indd 14 10/1/18 12:06 PM2019 Nelson's Pediatric Azoles, and Echinocandins2 Isavuconazole is a new triazole that was FDA approved in March 2015 for treatment of invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis with oral (capsules only) and IV formulations. Isavuconazole has a similar antifungal spectrum as voriconazole and some activity against Zygomycetes (yet, potentially, not as potent against Zygomycetes as posaconazole). A phase 3 clinical trial in adult patients demonstrated non-inferiority versus voriconazole against invasive aspergillosis and other mold infections, 11 and an open-label study showed activity against mucormycosis.12 Isavuconazole is actually dis- pensed as the prodrug isavuconazonium sulfate. Dosing in adult patients is loading with isavuconazole 200 mg (equivalent to 372-mg isavuconazonium sulfate) every 8 hours for 2 days (6 doses), followed by 200 mg once daily for maintenance dosing. The half-life is long (. 5 days), there is 98% bioavailability in adults, and there is no reported food effect with oral isavuconazole. The manufacturer suggests no need for therapeutic drug monitoring, but some experts suggest trough levels may be needed in difficult-to-treat infections and, absent well-defined therapeutic targets, the mean concentrations from phase II/III studies suggest a range of 2 to 3 mcg/mL after day 5 is adequate exposure. The IV formulation does not contain the vehicle cyclodextrin, unlike voriconazole, which could make it more attractive in patients with renal failure. Early experience suggests a much lower rate of photosensitivity and skin disorders as well as visual disturbances compared with voriconazole. No specific pediatric dosing data exist for isavuconazole yet, but studies have already begun. Echinocandins This class of systemic antifungal agents was first approved in 2001. The echinocandins inhibit cell wall formation (in contrast to acting on the cell membrane by the polyenes and azoles) by noncompetitively inhibiting beta-1,3-glucan synthase, an enzyme present in fungi but absent in mammalian cells. These agents are generally very safe, as there is no beta-1,3-glucan in humans. The echinocandins are not metabolized through the CYP system, so fewer drug interactions are problematic, compared with the azoles. There is no need to dose-adjust in renal failure, but one needs a lower dosage in the setting of very severe hepatic dysfunction. As a class, these antifungals generally have poor CSF penetra-tion, although animal studies have shown adequate brain parenchyma levels, and do not penetrate the urine well. While the 3 clinically available echinocandins each individually have some unique and important dosing and pharmacokinetic parameters, especially in children, efficacy is generally equivalent. Opposite the azole class, the echinocandins are fungicidal against yeasts but fungistatic against molds. The fungicidal activity against yeasts has elevated the echinocandins to the preferred therapy against invasive candi-diasis. Echinocandins are thought to be best utilized against invasive aspergillosis only as salvage therapy if a triazole fails or in a patient with suspected triazole resistance, but never as primary monotherapy against invasive aspergillosis or any other invasive mold infection. Improved efficacy with combination therapy with the echinocandins and triazoles against Aspergillus infections is unclear, with disparate results in multiple smaller studies and a definitive clinical trial demonstrating minimal benefit over voriconazole monotherapy in only certain patient populations. Some experts have used combination ch02-Nelson-2019_009-016.indd 15 10/1/18 12:06 PM16 \u2014 Chapter 2. Choosing invasive aspergillosis with a triazole plus echinocandin only during the initial phase of waiting for triazole drug levels to be appropriately high. There are reports of echinocandin resistance in Candida spp, as high as 12% in C glabrata in some studies, and the echinocandins as a class have previously been shown to be somewhat less active against Candida parapsilosis isolates (approximately 10%-15% respond poorly, but most are still susceptible, and guidelines still recommend echinocandin empiric therapy for invasive candidiasis). Caspofungin received FDA approval for children aged 3 months to 17 years in 2008 for empiric therapy of presumed fungal infections in febrile, neutropenic as Candida peritonitis, and empyema; and salvage therapy of invasive aspergillosis. Due to its earlier approval, there are generally more reports with caspofungin than the other echinocandins. Caspofungin dosing in children is calculated according to body surface area, with a loading dose on the first day of 70 mg/m 2, followed by daily maintenance dosing of 50 mg/m2, and not to exceed 70 mg regardless of the calculated dose. Significantly higher doses of caspofungin have been studied in adult patients without any clear added benefit in efficacy, but if the 50 mg/m 2 dose is tolerated and does not provide adequate clinical response, the daily dose can be increased to 70 mg/m 2. Dosing for caspofungin in neonates is 25 mg/m2/day. Micafungin was approved in adults in 2005 for treatment of candidemia, Candida esoph - agitis and peritonitis, and infections in stem cell transplant recipi- ents, and in 2013 for pediatric patients aged 4 months and older. Micafungin has the most pediatric and neonatal data available of all 3 echinocandins, including more extensive pharmacokinetic studies surrounding dosing and several efficacy studies. 13-15 Micafungin dosing in children is age dependent, as clearance increases dramatically in the younger age groups (especially neonates), necessitating higher doses for younger children. Doses in children are generally thought to be 2 mg/kg/day, with higher doses likely needed for younger patients, and preterm neonates dosed at 10 mg/kg/day. Adult micafungin dosing (100 or 150 mg once daily) is to be used in patients who weigh more than 40 kg. Unlike the other echinocandins, a loading dose is not required for micafungin. Anidulafungin was approved for adults for candidemia and Candida esophagitis in 2006 and is not officially approved for pediatric patients. Like the other echinocandins, anidu- lafungin is not P450 metabolized and has not demonstrated significant drug interactions. Limited clinical efficacy data are available in children, with only some pediatric phar - macokinetic data suggesting weight-based dosing (3 mg/kg/day loading dose, followed by 1.5 mg/kg/day maintenance dosing). 16 This dosing achieves similar exposure levels in neonates and infants.16 The adult dose for invasive candidiasis is a loading dose of 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg daily. ch02-Nelson-2019_009-016.indd 16 10/1/18 12:06 PM2019 Nelson's Pediatric Antimicrobial Therapy \u2014 17 How Antibiotic Dosages Are Determined Using Susceptibility Data, Pharmacodynamics, and Treatment Outcomes3 3. How Antibiotic Dosages Are Determined Using Susceptibility Data, Pharmacodynamics, and Treatment Outcomes Factors Involved in Dosing Recommendations Our view of the optimal use of antimicrobials is continually changing. As the published literature and our experience with each drug increases, our recommendations for specific dosages evolve as we compare the efficacy, safety, and cost of each drug in the context of current and previous data from adults and children. Every new antibiotic that treats infec-tions that occur in both adults and children must demonstrate some degree of efficacy and safety in adults with antibiotic exposures that occur at specific dosages, which we duplicate in children as closely as possible. Occasionally, due to unanticipated toxicities and unanticipated clinical failures at a specific dosage in children that should have been effective, we will modify our initial recommendations for an antibiotic. Important considerations in any recommendations we make include (1) the susceptibili- ties of pathogens to antibiotics, which are constantly changing, are different from region to region, and are often hospital- and unit-specific; (2) the antibiotic concentrations achieved at the site of infection over a 24-hour dosing interval; (3) the mechanism of how antibiotics kill bacteria; (4) how often the dose we select produces a clinical and micro-biological cure; (5) how often we encounter toxicity; (6) how likely the antibiotic exposure will lead to antibiotic resistance in the treated child and in the population in general; and (7) the effect on the child's microbiome. Susceptibility Susceptibility data for each bacterial pathogen against a wide range of antibiotics are available from the microbiology laboratory of virtually every hospital. This antibiogram can help guide you in antibiotic selection for empiric therapy while you wait for specific susceptibilities to come back from your cultures. Many hospitals can separate the inpa-tient culture results from outpatient results, and many can give you the data by hospital ward (eg, pediatric ward vs neonatal intensive care unit vs adult intensive care unit). Susceptibility data are also available by region and by country from reference labora-tories or public health laboratories. The recommendations made in Nelson's Pediatric Antimicrobial Therapy reflect overall susceptibility patterns present in the United States. Tables A and B in Chapter 7 provide some overall guidance on susceptibility of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, respectively. Wide variations may exist for certain pathogens in different regions of the United States and the world. New techniques for rapid molecular diagnosis of a bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, or viral pathogen based on polymerase chain reaction or next-generation sequencing may quickly give you the name of the pathogen, but with current molecular technology, susceptibility data are usually not available. Drug Concentrations at the Site of Infection With every antibiotic, we can measure the concentration of antibiotic present in the serum. We can also directly measure the concentrations in specific tissue sites, such as spinal fluid or middle ear fluid. Because \"free, \" nonprotein-bound antibiotic is required to ch03-Nelson-2019_017-020.indd 17 11/7/18 8:37 AM18 \u2014 Chapter 3. How Antibiotic Dosages Are Determined Using Susceptibility Data, Pharmacodynamics, and Treatment Outcomes How Antibiotic Dosages Are Determined Using Susceptibility Data, Pharmacodynamics, and Treatment Outcomes3 inhibit and kill pathogens, it is also important to calculate the amount of free drug avail- able at the site of infection. While traditional methods of measuring antibiotics focused on the peak concentrations in serum and how rapidly the drugs were excreted, complex models of drug distribution in plasma and tissue sites (eg, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, peri-toneal fluid) and elimination from plasma and tissue compartments now exist. Antibiotic exposure to pathogens at the site of infection can be described mathematically in many ways: (1) the percentage of time in a 24-hour dosing interval that the antibiotic concen-trations are above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; the antibiotic concentra-tion required for inhibition of growth of an organism) at the site of infection (%T. MIC); (2) the mathematically calculated area below the serum concentration-versus-time curve (area under the curve [AUC]); and (3) the maximal concentration of drug achieved at the tissue site (Cmax). For each of these 3 values, a ratio of that value to the MIC of the pathogen in question can be calculated and provides more useful information on specific drug activity against a specific pathogen than simply looking at the MIC. It allows us to compare the exposure of different antibiotics (that achieve quite different concentrations in tissues) to a pathogen (where the MIC for each drug may be different) and to assess the activity of a single antibiotic that may be used for empiric therapy against the many differ - ent pathogens (potentially with many different MICs) that may be causing an infection at that tissue site. Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamic descriptions provide the clinician with information on how the bacterial pathogens are killed ( see Suggested Reading). Beta-lactam antibiotics tend to eradicate bacteria following prolonged exposure of relatively low concentrations of the antibiotic to the pathogen at the site of infection, usually expressed as the percent of time over a dosing interval that the antibiotic is present at the site of infection in concentra-tions greater than the MIC (%T. MIC). For example, amoxicillin needs to be present at the site of pneumococcal infection (eg, middle ear) at a concentration above the MIC for only 40% of a 24-hour dosing interval. Remarkably, neither higher concentrations of amoxicillin nor a more prolonged exposure will substantially increase the cure rate. On the other hand, gentamicin's activity against Escherichia coli is based primarily on the absolute concentration of free antibiotic at the site of infection, in the context of the MIC of the pathogen (Cmax:MIC). The more antibiotic you can deliver to the site of infec-tion, the more rapidly you can sterilize the tissue; we are only limited by the toxicities of gentamicin. For fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin, the antibiotic exposure best linked to clinical and microbiologic success is, like aminoglycosides, concentration-dependent. However, the best mathematical correlate to microbiologic (and clinical) outcomes for fluoroquinolones is the AUC:MIC, rather than Cmax:MIC. All 3 metrics of antibiotic exposure should be linked to the MIC of the pathogen to best understand how well the anti biotic will eradicate the pathogen causing the infection. ch03-Nelson-2019_017-020.indd 18 11/7/18 8:37 AM2019 Nelson's Pediatric Antimicrobial Therapy \u2014 19 How Antibiotic Dosages Are Determined Using Susceptibility Data, Pharmacodynamics, and Treatment Outcomes3 Assessment of Clinical and Microbiological Outcomes In clinical trials of anti-infective agents, most adults and children will hopefully be cured, but a few will fail therapy. For those few, we may note unanticipated inadequate drug exposure (eg, more rapid drug elimination in a particular patient; the inability of a par - ticular antibiotic to penetrate to the site of infection in its active form, not bound to salts or proteins) or infection caused by a pathogen with a particularly high MIC. By analyzing the successes and the failures based on the appropriate exposure parameters outlined previously (%T. MIC, AUC:MIC, or Cmax:MIC), we can often observe a particular value of exposure, above which we observe a higher rate of cure and below which the cure rate drops quickly. Knowing this target value in adults (the \"antibiotic exposure break point\") allows us to calculate the dosage that will create treatment success in most children. We do not evaluate antibiotics with study designs that have failure rates in children sufficient to calculate a pediatric exposure break point. It is the adult exposure value that leads to success that we all (including the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] and phar - maceutical companies) subsequently share with you, a pediatric health care practitioner, as one likely to cure your patient. US FDA-approved break points that are reported by microbiology laboratories (S, I, and R) are now determined by outcomes linked to drug pharmacokinetics and exposure, the MIC, and the pharmacodynamic parameter for that agent. Recommendations to the FDA for break points for the United States often come from \"break point organizations, \" such as the US Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (www.uscast.org) or the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Insti-tute Subcommittee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (https://clsi.org/education/microbiology/ast). Suggested Reading Bradley JS, et Therapy of Drug-Resistant Gram-negative Bacilli and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus4 4. Bacilli and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp, has caused profound difficulties in management of patients around the world; some of the pathogens are now resistant to all available agents. At this time, a limited number of pediatric tertiary care centers in North America have reported isolated outbreaks, but sustained transmission of completely resistant organisms has not yet been reported in children, likely due to the critical infec-tion control strategies in place to prevent spread within pediatric health care institutions. However, for complicated hospitalized neonates, infants, and children, multiple treatment courses of antibiotics for documented or suspected infections can create substantial resis- tance to many classes of agents, particularly in P aeruginosa. These pathogens have the genetic capability to express resistance to virtually any antibiotic used, as a result of more than one hundred million years of exposure to antibiotics elaborated by other organisms in their environment. Inducible enzymes to cleave antibiotics and modify binding sites, efflux pumps, and Gram-negative cell wall alterations to prevent antibiotic penetration (and combinations of mechanisms) all may be present. Some mechanisms of resistance, if not intrinsic, can be acquired from other bacilli. By using antibiotics, we \"awaken\" resis-tance; therefore, only using antibiotics when appropriate limits the selection, or induction, of resistance for both that child and for all children. Community prevalence, as well as health care institution prevalence of resistant organisms, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-containing Escherichia coli, is increasing. In Figure 4-1, we assume that the clinician has the antibiotic susceptibility report in hand (or at least a local antibiogram). Each tier provides increasingly broader spectrum activity, from the narrowest of the Gram-negative agents to the broadest (and most toxic), colistin. Tier 1 is ampicillin, safe and widely available but not active against Klebsiella, Enterobac - ter, or Pseudomonas and only active against about half of E coli in the community setting. Tier 2 contains antibiotics that have a broader spectrum but are also very safe and effec- tive (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [TMP/SMX] and cephalosporins), with decades of experience. In general, use an antibiotic from tier 2 before going to broader spectrum agents. Please be aware that many enteric bacilli (the SPICE well as the fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline), which may manifest only after exposure of the pathogen to the antibiotic. Tier 3 is made up of very broad-spectrum anti-biotics (carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam) and aminoglycosides (with significantly more toxicity than beta-lactam antibacterial agents, although we have used them safely for decades). Use any antibiotic from tier 3 before going to broader spectrum agents. Tier 4 is fluoroquinolones, to be used only when lower-tier antibiotics cannot be used due to potential (and not yet verified in children) toxicities. Tier 5 is represented by a new ch04-Nelson-2019_021-028.indd 21 11/12/18 11:43 AM22 \u2014 Chapter 4.

Tier 6 is colistin, one of the broadest-spectrum agents available. Colistin was US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in 1962 with significant toxicity and limited clinical experience in children. Many newer drugs for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organ-isms are currently investigational for adults and children. Investigational Agents Recently Approved for Adults That Are Being Studied in Children Ceftazidime and avibactam. Familiar ceftazidime, a third-generation cephalosporin active against many strains of Pseudomonas, is paired with avibactam allowing for activity against against Pseudomonas that is already stable to ESBL beta-lactamases, is now paired with vaborbactam allowing for activity against the KPC but not metallo-carbapenemases. Plazomicin. A new aminoglycoside antibiotic that is active against many of the and aureus (CA-MRSA) is a community pathogen for children (that can also spread from child to child in hospitals) that first appeared in the United States in the mid-1990s and currently represents 30% to 80% of all community isolates in various regions of the United States (check your hospital microbiology laboratory for your local rate); it is increasingly present in many areas of the world, with some strain variation documented. Notably, we have begun to see a decrease in invasive MRSA infections in some institutions, as documented in Houston, TX, by Hult\u00e9n and Mason. 1 CA-MRSA is resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, except for ceftaro- line, a fifth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic FDA approved for pediatrics in June 2016 (see Chapter 1). There are an undetermined number of pathogenicity factors that make CA-MRSA more aggressive than methicillin-susceptible S aureus (MSSA) strains. CA-MRSA seems to cause greater tissue necrosis, an increased host inflammatory response, an increased rate of complications, and an increased rate of recurrent infections compared with MSSA. Response to therapy with non-beta-lactam antibiotics (eg, vancomycin, clindamycin) seems to be inferior compared with the response of MSSA to oxacillin/nafcillin or cefazo-lin, but it is unknown whether poorer outcomes are due to a hardier, better-adapted, more ch04-Nelson-2019_021-028.indd 23 11/12/18 11:43 AM24 \u2014 to Antibiotic Therapy of Drug-Resistant Gram-negative Bacilli and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Approach to Drug-Resistant Gram-negative Bacilli and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus4 aggressive CA-MRSA or whether these alternative agents are just not as effective against MRSA as beta-lactam agents are against MSSA. Studies in children using ceftaroline to treat skin infections (many caused by MRSA) were conducted using a non-inferiority clinical trial design, compared with vancomycin, with the finding that ceftaroline was equivalent to vancomycin. Guidelines for management of MRSA infections (2011) and management of skin and soft tissue infections (2014) have been published by the Infec-tious Diseases Society of America 2 and are available at www.idsociety.org, as well as in Red Book: 2018-2021 Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases. Antimicrobials for CA-MRSA Vancomycin (intravenous [IV]) has been the mainstay of parenteral therapy of MRSA infections for the past 4 decades and continues to have activity against more than 98% of strains isolated from children. A few cases of intermediate resistance and \"hetero-resistance\" (transient moderately increased resistance likely to be based on thickened staphylococcal cell walls) have been reported, most commonly in adults who are receiving long-term therapy or who have received multiple exposures to vancomycin. Unfortu-nately, the response to therapy using standard vancomycin dosing of 40 mg/kg/day in the treatment of many CA-MRSA strains has not been as predictably successful as in the past with MSSA. Increasingly, data in adults suggest that serum trough concentrations of vancomycin in treating serious CA-MRSA infections should be kept in the range of 15 to 20 mcg/mL, which frequently causes toxicity in adults. For children, serum trough con- centrations of 15 to 20 mcg/mL can usually be achieved using the old pediatric \"menin-gitis dosage\" of vancomycin of 60 mg/kg/day but are also associated with renal toxicity. Although no prospectively collected data are available, it appears that this dosage in chil-dren is reasonably effective and not associated with the degree of nephrotoxicity observed in adults. For vancomycin efficacy, the ratio of the area under the serum concentration curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC:MIC) appears to be the best exposure metric to predict a successful outcome, with better outcomes achieved with an AUC:MIC of about 400 or greater (see Chapter 3 for more on the AUC:MIC). This ratio is achiev-able for CA-MRSA strains with in vitro MIC values of 1 mcg/mL or less but difficult to achieve for strains with 2 mcg/mL or greater. 3 Recent data suggest that vancomycin MICs may actually be decreasing in children for MRSA, causing bloodstream infections as they increase for MSSA. 4 Strains with MIC values of 4 mcg/mL or greater should be considered resistant to vancomycin. When using these higher \"meningitis\" treatment dosages, one needs to follow renal function carefully for the development of toxicity and subsequent need to switch classes of antibiotics. Clindamycin (oral [PO] or IV) is active against approximately 70% to 90% of strains of either MRSA or MSSA, with great geographic variability (again, check with your hospital laboratory). 5 The dosage for moderate to severe infections is 30 to 40 mg/kg/day, in 3 divided doses, using the same mg/kg dose PO or IV . Clindamycin is not as bactericidal as vancomycin but achieves higher concentrations in abscesses (based on high intracellu-lar concentrations in neutrophils). Some CA-MRSA strains are susceptible to clindamycin on initial testing but have inducible Pediatric Antimicrobial Therapy of Drug-Resistant Gram-negative Bacilli and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus4 is usually assessed by the \"D-test\" and, more recently, in automated multi-well microti- ter plates. Within each population of CA-MRSA organisms, a rare organism (between 1 in 10 9 and 1011 organisms) will have a mutation that allows for constant (rather than induced) resistance.6 Although still somewhat controversial, clindamycin should be effective therapy for infections that have a relatively low organism load (cellulitis, small or drained abscesses) and are unlikely to contain a significant population of these constitutive methylase-producing mutants that are truly resistant (in contrast to the strains that are not already producing methylase and, in fact, are actually poorly induced by clindamycin). Infections with a high organism load (empyema) may have a greater risk of failure (as a large population is more likely to have a significant number of truly resistant organisms), and clindamycin should not be used as the preferred agent for these infections. Many laboratories no longer report D-test results but simply call the organism \"resistant, \" prompting the use of alternative therapy that may not be needed. Clindamycin is used to treat most CA-MRSA infections that are not life-threatening, and, if the child responds, therapy can be switched from IV to PO (although the oral solution is not very well tolerated). Clostridium difficile enterocolitis is a concern; however, despite a great increase in the use of clindamycin in children during the past decade, recent pub-lished data do not document a clinically significant increase in the rate of this complica-tion in children. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) (PO, IV), Bactrim/Septra, is active against CA-MRSA in vitro. Prospective comparative data on treatment of skin or skin structure infections in adults and children document efficacy equivalent to clindamycin. 7 Given our current lack of prospective, comparative information in MRSA bacteremia, pneumonia, and osteomyelitis (in contrast to skin infections), TMP/SMX should not be used routinely to treat these more serious infections at this time. Linezolid (PO, IV), active against virtually 100% of CA-MRSA strains, is another reason- able alternative but is considered bacteriostatic and has relatively frequent hematologic toxicity in adults (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) and some infrequent neurologic toxicity (peripheral neuropathy, optic neuritis), particularly when used for courses of 2 weeks or longer (a complete blood cell count should be checked every week or 2 in children receiving prolonged linezolid therapy). The cost of linezolid is substantially more than clindamycin or vancomycin. Daptomycin (IV), FDA approved for adults for skin infections in 2003 and, subsequently, for bacteremia/endocarditis, was approved for use for children with skin infections in April 2017. It is a unique class of antibiotic, a lipopeptide, and is highly bactericidal. Daptomycin became generic in 2017 and should be considered for treatment of skin infection and bacteremia in failures with other, better studied antibiotics. Daptomycin should not be used to treat pneumonia, as it is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant. Pediatric studies for skin infections and bacteremia have been completed and published, 8,9 and those for osteomyelitis have concluded but have not been presented. Some newborn animal neurologic toxicity data suggest additional caution for the use of daptomycin in ch04-Nelson-2019_021-028.indd 25 11/12/18 11:43 AM26 \u2014 Chapter 4. to Antibiotic Therapy of Drug-Resistant Gram-negative Bacilli and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Approach to of Drug-Resistant Gram-negative Bacilli and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus4 infants younger than 1 year, prompting a warning in the package label. Pediatric clinical trial investigations in young infants are not proceeding at this time. Tigecycline and fluoroquinolones, both of which may show in vitro activity, are not generally recommended for children if other agents are available and are tolerated due to potential toxicity issues for children with tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones and rapid emergence of resistance with fluoroquinolones. a fifth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, the first FDA-approved beta- lactam antibiotic to be active against MRSA, was approved for children in June 2016. The Gram-negative coverage is similar to cefotaxime, with no activity against Pseudomonas. Published data are available for pediatric pharmacokinetics, as well as for prospective, randomized comparative treatment trials of skin and skin structure infections 10 and community-acquired pneumonia.11,12 The efficacy and toxicity profile in adults is what one would expect from most cephalosporins. Based on these published data and review by the FDA, for infants and children 2 months and older, ceftaroline should be effective and safer than vancomycin for treatment of MRSA infections. Just as beta-lactams are pre-ferred over vancomycin for MSSA infections, ceftaroline should be considered preferred treatment over vancomycin for MRSA infections. Neither renal function nor drug levels need to be followed with ceftaroline therapy. Since pediatric approval in mid-2016, there have been no reported post-marketing adverse experiences in children; recommendations may change if unexpected clinical data on lack of efficacy or unexpected toxicity (beyond what may be expected with beta-lactams) should be presented. Combination therapy for serious infections, with vancomycin and rifampin (for deep abscesses) or vancomycin and gentamicin (for bacteremia), is often used, but no prospec- tive, controlled human clinical data exist on improved efficacy over single antibiotic therapy. Some experts use vancomycin and clindamycin in combination, particularly for children with a toxic-shock clinical presentation. Ceftaroline has also been used in combination therapy with other agents in adults, but no prospective, controlled clinical data exist to assess benefits. Investigational Agents Recently Approved for Adults That Are Being Studied in Children Dalbavancin and Oritavancin. Both antibiotics are IV glycopeptides, structurally very similar to vancomycin but with enhanced in vitro activity against MRSA and a much longer serum half-life, allowing once-weekly dosing or even just a single dose to treat skin infections. Telavancin. A glycolipopeptide with mechanisms of activity that include cell wall inhibi- tion and cell membrane depolarization, telavancin is Tedizolid. A second-generation oxazolidinone like linezolid, tedizolid is more potent in vitro against MRSA than linezolid, with somewhat decreased toxicity to bone marrow in adult clinical studies. ch04-Nelson-2019_021-028.indd 26 11/12/18 11:43 AM2019 Nelson's Pediatric Antimicrobial Therapy Therapy of Drug-Resistant Gram-negative Bacilli and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus4 Recommendations for Empiric Therapy of Suspected MRSA Infections Life-threatening and Serious Infections. If any CA-MRSA is present in your com- munity, empiric therapy for presumed staphylococcal infections that are life-threatening or infections for which any risk of failure is unacceptable (eg, meningitis) should follow the recommendations for CA-MRSA and include high-dose vancomycin, clindamycin, or linezolid, in addition to nafcillin or oxacillin (beta-lactam antibiotics are considered better than vancomycin or clindamycin for MSSA). Ceftaroline is now another option for possible MRSA infections, particularly for children with some degree of renal injury, and will replace vancomycin in the near future if safety and efficacy are confirmed. Moderate Infections. If you live in a location with greater than 10% methicillin resistance, consider using the CA-MRSA recommendations for hospitalized children with presumed staphylococcal infections of any severity, and start empiric therapy with clindamycin (usually active against . 80% of CA-MRSA), ceftaroline, vancomycin, or linezolid IV . In skin and skin structure abscesses, drainage of the abscess may be completely curative in some children, and antibiotics may not be necessary following incision and drainage. Mild Infections. For nonserious, presumed staphylococcal infections in regions with significant CA-MRSA, empiric topical therapy with mupirocin (Bactroban) or retapamu- lin (Altabax) ointment, or oral therapy with TMP/SMX or clindamycin, is preferred. For older children, doxycycline and minocycline are also options based on data in adults. Prevention of Recurrent Infections For children with problematic, recurrent infections, no well-studied, prospectively col-lected data provide a solution. Bleach baths (one-half cup of bleach in a full bathtub) 13 seems to be able to transiently decrease the numbers of colonizing organisms but was not shown to decrease the number of infections in a prospective, controlled study in children with eczema. Similarly, a regimen to decolonize with twice-weekly bleach baths in an attempt to prevent recurrent infection did not lead to a statistically significant decrease. 14 Bathing with chlorhexidine (Hibiclens, a preoperative antibacterial skin disinfectant) daily or 2 to 3 times each week should provide topical anti-MRSA activity for several hours following a bath. Treating the entire family with decolonization regimens will provide an additional decrease in risk of recurrence for the index child. 15 Nasal mupirocin ointment (Bactroban) designed to eradicate colonization may also be used. All these mea-sures have advantages and disadvantages and need to be used together with environmen-tal measures (eg, washing towels frequently, using hand sanitizers, not sharing items of clothing). Helpful advice can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Web site at www.cdc.gov/mrsa (accessed September 26, 2018). Vaccines are being investigated but are not likely to be available for several years. ch04-Nelson-2019_021-028.indd 27 Antimicrobial Therapy for Newborns5 5. Antimicrobial Therapy for Newborns NOTES Prospectively collected data in newborns continue to become available, thanks in large part to federal legislation (including the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 that mandates neonatal studies). In situations of inadequate data, suggested doses are based on efficacy, safety, and pharmacological data from older children or adults. These may not account for the effect of devel-opmental changes (effect of ontogeny) on drug metabolism that occur during early infancy and among preterm and full-term newborns. 1 These values may vary widely, particularly for the unstable preterm newborn. Oral convalescent therapy for neonatal infections has not been well studied but may be used cautiously in non-life- threatening infections in adherent families with ready access to medical care. 2 The recommended antibiotic dosages and intervals of administration are given in the tables in this chapter. Adverse drug reaction: Neonates should not receive intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone while receiving IV calcium-containing products, including parenteral nutrition, by the same or different infusion lines, as fatal reactions with ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates in lungs and kidneys in neonates have occurred. There are no data on interactions between IV ceftriaxone and oral calcium-containing products or between intramuscular ceftri- axone and IV or oral calcium-containing products. 3 Cefotaxime or other cephalosporins with similar microbiologic twice daily; CBC, complete blood cell count; CDC, Centers for Disease Prevention; CLD, US Food and Drug Adminis-tration; GA, gestational age; GBS, group B streptococcus; trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole; UCSF, Therapy for Newborns Antimicrobial Therapy for Newborns5 A.

If such patients are treated with parenteral ganciclovir, a reasonable approach is to treat for 2 wk and then reassess responsiveness to therapy. If clinical and laboratory data suggest benefit of treatment, an additional 1 wk of parenteral ganciclovir can be considered if symptoms and signs have not fully resolved. Oral valganciclovir is not recommended in these more severe disease presentations. Observe for possible relapse after completion of therapy (AIII). Fungal infections (See also Chapter 8.) - Candidiasis 26-35Treatment AmB-D (1 mg/kg/day) is recommended therapy (AII). Fluconazole (12 mg/kg/day q24h, after a load of 25 mg/kg/day) is an alternative if patient has not been on fluconazole prophylaxis (AII).26 For treatment of neonates and young infants (,120 days) on ECMO, fluconazole loading dose is 35 mg/kg on day 1, then 12 mg/kg q24h (BII).36,37 Lipid formulation AmB is an alternative but carries a theoretical risk of less urinary tract penetration compared with AmB-D (CIII).37 Duration of therapy for candidemia without obvious metastatic complications is for 2 wk after documented clearance and resolution of symptoms (therefore generally 3 wk total). ProphylaxisIn nurseries with high rates of candidiasis (.10%), 38 IV or oral fluconazole prophylaxis (AI) (3-6 mg/kg twice weekly for 6 wk) in high-risk neonates (birth weight ,1,000 g) is recommended. Oral nystatin, 100,000 units tid for 6 wk, is an alternative to fluconazole in neonates with birth weights ,1,500 g if availability or resistance preclude fluconazole use (CII). Prophylaxis of neonates and children on ECMO: fluconazole 12 mg/kg on day 1, followed by 6 mg/kg/day (BII). Neonates are at high risk of urinary tract and CNS infection, problematic for echinocandins with poor penetration at those sites; therefore, AmB-D is preferred, followed by fluconazole, and echinocandins discouraged, despite their fungicidal activity.

Prophylaxis: palivizumab (a monoclonal antibody) 15 mg/kg IM monthly (maximum: 5 doses) for the following high-risk infants (AI): In first year after birth, palivizumab prophylaxis is recommended for infants born before 29 wk 0 days' gestation. Palivizumab prophylaxis is not recommended for otherwise healthy infants born at $29 wk 0 days' gestation. In first year after birth, palivizumab prophylaxis is recommended for preterm infants with CLD of prematurity, defined as birth at ,32 wk 0 days' gestation and a requirement for .21% oxygen for at least 28 days after birth. Clinicians may administer palivizumab prophylaxis in the first year after birth to certain infants with hemodynamically significant heart disease.Aerosol ribavirin (6-g vial to make 20-mg/mL solution in sterile water), aerosolized over 18-20 h daily for 3-5 days (BII), provides little benefit and should only be considered for use in life-threatening RSV infection. Difficulties in administration, complications with airway reactivity, concern for potential toxicities to health care workers, and lack of definitive evidence of benefit preclude routine use. Palivizumab does not provide benefit in the treatment of an active RSV infection. Palivizumab prophylaxis may be considered for children ,24 mo who will be profoundly immunocompromised during the RSV season. Palivizumab prophylaxis is not recommended in the second year after birth except for children who required at least 28 days of supplemental oxygen after birth and who continue to require medical support (supplemental oxygen, chronic corticosteroid therapy, or diuretic therapy) during the 6-mo period before the start of the second RSV season. Monthly prophylaxis should be discontinued in any child who experiences a breakthrough RSV hospitalization. Children with pulmonary abnormality or neuromuscular disease that impairs the ability to clear secretions from the upper airways may be considered for prophylaxis in the first year after birth. Insufficient data are available to recommend palivizumab prophylaxis for children with cystic fibrosis or Down syndrome. The burden of RSV disease and costs associated with transport from remote locations may result in a broader use of palivizumab for RSV prevention in Alaska Native populations and possibly in selected other American Indian populations. 86,87 Palivizumab prophylaxis is not recommended for prevention of health care-associated RSV disease. - S aureus17,88-90MSSA: oxacillin/nafcillin IV (AIII).MRSA: vancomycin IV OR clindamycin IV if susceptible (AIII).

Desired serum concentrations; a 24-h AUC:MIC of 400 mg\u00b7h/L is recommended based on adult studies of invasive MRSA infections. The AUC is best cal- culated from 2 concentrations (ie, peak and trough) rather than 1 trough serum concentration measurement. In situa- tions in which AUC calculation is not feasible, a trough concentration 10-12 mg/L is very highly likely (.90%) to achieve the goal AUC target in neonates when the MIC is 1 mg/L. If .60 days of age, see Chapter 11. E. Use of Antimicrobials During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding The use of antimicrobials during pregnancy and lactation should balance benefit to the mother with the risk of fetal and infant toxicity (including anatomic anomalies with fetal exposure). A number of factors determine the degree of transfer of antibiotics across the placenta: lipid solubility, degree of ionization, molecular weight, protein binding, placental maturation, and placental and fetal blood flow. The previous FDA labeling of 5 categories of risk will be phased out, replaced by narrative summaries of risks associated with the use of a drug during pregnancy and lactation for the mother, the fetus, and the breastfeeding child. The risk categories from A to X were felt to be too simplistic and are to be phased out by 2020. Risks are now all clearly noted, and for drugs with high fetal risk, black box warnings are included (eg, ribavirin). 115 Fetal serum antibiotic concentrations (or cord blood concentrations) following maternal administration have not been systematically studied, but new pharmacokinetic models of transplacental drug transfer and fetal metabolism have recently been developed to provide some insight into fetal drug exposure. 116-118 The following commonly used drugs appear to achieve fetal concentrations that are equal to or only slightly less than those in the mother: penicillin G, amoxicillin, ampicillin, sulfonamides, fetal serum are 20% to in maternal serum. carbapenems, nafcillin, oxacillin, clindamy-cin, and vancomycin and fetal concentrations of erythro-mycin and azithromycin are less than 10% of those in mother. ch05-Nelson-2019_029-058.indd 56 11/13/18 1:27 PM2019 Nelson's Pediatric Antimicrobial Therapy \u2014 57 Antimicrobial Therapy for Newborns5 The most current, updated information on the pharmacokinetics and safety of antimicro- bials and other agents in human milk can be found at the National Library of Medicine LactMed Web site (http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/lactmed.htm; accessed Septem-ber 27, 2018). 119 In general, neonatal exposure to antimicrobials in human milk Aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, macrolides, fluconazole, and agents for tuberculosis are considered safe for the mother to take during breastfeed-ing. 120,121 The most common reported neonatal side effect of maternal antimicrobial use during breastfeeding is increased stool output.122 Clinicians should recommend mothers alert their pediatric health care professional if stool output changes occur. Maternal treat-ment with sulfa-containing antibiotics should be approached with caution in the breastfed infant who is jaundiced or ill. Antimicrobial Therapy According to Clinical Syndromes6 6. Antimicrobial Therapy According to Clinical Syndromes NOTES This chapter should be considered a rough guidance for a typical patient. Dosage recommendations are for patients with relatively normal hydration, renal function, and hepatic function. Because the dose required is based on the exposure of the anti-biotic to the pathogen at the site of infection, higher dosages may be necessary if the antibiotic does not penetrate well into the infected tissue (eg, meningitis) or if the child eliminates the antibiotic from the body more quickly than average. Higher dos-ages/longer courses may also be needed if the child is immunocompromised and the immune system cannot help resolve the infection, as it is becoming clearer that the host contributes significantly to microbiologic and clinical cure above and beyond the antimicrobial-attributable effect. Duration of treatment should be individualized. Those recommended are based on the literature, common practice, and general experience. Critical evaluations of duration of therapy have been carried out in very few infectious diseases. In general, a longer duration of therapy should be used (1) for tissues in which antibiotic concentrations may be relatively low (eg, undrained abscess, central nervous system [CNS] infection); (2) for tissues in which repair following infection-mediated damage is slow (eg, bone); (3) when the organisms are less susceptible; (4) when a relapse of infection is unac-ceptable (eg, CNS infections); or (5) when the host is immunocompromised in some way. An assessment after therapy will ensure that your selection of antibiotic, dose, and duration of therapy were appropriate. Until prospective, comparative studies are per - formed for different durations, we cannot assign a specific increased risk of failure for shorter courses. We support the need for these studies in a controlled clinical research setting, either outpatient or inpatient. Our approach to therapy is continuing to move away from the concept that \"one dose fits all, \" as noted previously. In addition to the dose that provides antibiotic exposure and host immune competence, the concept of target attainment is being better defined. The severity of illness and the willingness of the practitioner to accept a certain rate of failure needs to be considered. Hence the use of broad-spectrum, high-dose treat-ment for a child in florid septic shock (where you need to be right virtually 100% of the time), compared with the child with impetigo where a treatment that is approximately 80% effective is acceptable, as you can just see the child back in the office in a few days and alter therapy as necessary. Diseases in this chapter are arranged by body systems. Please consult the index for the alphabetized listing of diseases and chapters 7 through 10 for the alphabetized listing of pathogens and for uncommon organisms not included in this chapter. A more detailed description of treatment options for methicillin-resistant Staphy - lococcus aureus (MRSA) infections and multidrug-resistant infections, including a stepwise agents, is ch06-Nelson-2019_059-126.indd 59 11/13/18 1:32 PM60 \u2014 Chapter 6. Antimicrobial Therapy According to Clinical Syndromes Antimicrobial Therapy According to Clinical Syndromes6 provided in Chapter 4. Although in the past, vancomycin has been the mainstay of therapy for invasive MRSA, it is nephrotoxic and ototoxic, and it requires monitoring renal function and serum drug concentrations. Its use in organisms with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 2 or greater may not provide adequate exposure for a cure with realistic pediatric doses. Alternatives now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for children, particularly ceftaroline, are likely to be as effective, but are more likely to be safer, and should be considered. Therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa systemic infections has evolved from intravenous (IV) ceftazidime plus tobramycin to single-drug IV therapy with cefepime for most infections in immune-competent children, due to the relative stability of cefepime to beta-lactamases, compared with ceftazidime. Oral therapy with ciprofloxacin has replaced IV therapy in children who are compliant and able to take oral therapy, par - ticularly for \"step-down\" therapy of invasive infections.

Antibiotic recommendations \"for CA-MRSA\" should be used for empiric therapy in regions with greater than 5% to 10% of invasive staphylococcal infections caused by MRSA, in situations where CA-MRSA is suspected, and for documented CA-MRSA infections, while \"standard recommendations\" refer to treatment of MSSA. During the past few years, clindamycin resistance in MRSA has increased to 40% in some areas but remained stable at 5% in others, although this increase may be an artifact of changes in reporting, with many laboratories now reporting all clindamycin-susceptible but D-test-positive strains as resistant.

Otitis media, acute NOTE: The natural history of AOM in different age groups by specific pathogens has not been well defined; therefore, the actual contribution of antibiotic therapy on resolution of disease had also been poorly defined until 2 blinded, prospective studies using amox/clav vs placebo were published in 2011,92,93 although neither study used tympanocentesis to define a pathogen. The benefits and risks (including development of antibiotic resistance) of antibiotic therapy for AOM need to be further evaluated before the most accurate advice on the \"best\" antibiotic can be provided. However, based on available data, for most children, amoxicillin or amox/clav can be used initially. Considerations for the need for extended antimicrobial activity of amox/clav include severity of disease, young age of the child, previous antibiotic therapy within 6 months, and child care attendance, which address the issues of types of pathogens and antibiotic resistance patterns to expect. However, with universal PCV13 immunization, data suggest that the risk of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal otitis has decreased but the percent of Haemophilus responsible for AOM have increased; therefore, some experts recommend use of amox/clav as first-line therapy for well-documented AOM. The most current AAP guidelines 94 and meta-analyses95,96 suggest the greatest benefit with therapy occurs in children with bilateral AOM who are younger than 2 years; for other children, close observation is also an option. AAP guidelines provide an option to treatment in non-severe cases, particularly disease in older children, to provide a prescription to parents but have them only fill the prescription if the child deteriorates.94 Although prophylaxis is only rarely indicated, amoxicillin or other antibiotics can be used in half the therapeutic dose once or twice daily to prevent infections if the benefits outweigh the risks of development of resistant organisms for that child. 94 - Newborns See Chapter 5. - Infants and children (pneumococcus, Haemophilus bid, with or without clavulanate; failures of amoxicillin in children not immunized with PCV13 will most likely be caused by beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus (or Moraxella). a) For Haemophilus strains that are beta-lactamase positive, the following oral antibiotics offer better in vitro activity than amoxicillin: amox/ achieves greater middle ear activity than oral cephalosporins.

Endocarditis prophylaxis213,217,221: Given that (1) endocarditis is rarely caused by dental/GI procedures and (2) prophylaxis for procedures prevents an exceedingly small number of cases, the risks of antibiotics outweigh the benefits. Highest risk conditions currently recommended for prophylaxis: (1) prosthetic heart valve (or prosthetic material used to repair a valve); (2) previous endocarditis; (3) cyanotic congenital heart disease that is unrepaired (or palliatively repaired with shunts and conduits); (4) congenital heart disease that is repaired but with defects at the site of repair adjacent to prosthetic material; (5) completely repaired congenital heart disease using prosthetic material, for the first 6 mo after repair; or (6) cardiac transplant patients with valvulopathy. Routine prophylaxis no longer is required for children with native valve abnormalities. Assessment of new prophylaxis guidelines documents a possible increase in viridans streptococcal endocarditis in children 10-17 y old but not 0-9 y old. 222 However, no changes in prophylaxis recommendations are being made at this time. - In highest risk patients: dental procedures that involve manipulation of the gingival or periodontal region of teethAmoxicillin 50 mg/kg PO 60 min before procedure OR ampicillin or ceftriaxone or cefazolin, all at procedureIf penicillin allergy: clindamycin 20 mg/kg PO (60 min before) or IV (30 min before); OR azithromycin 15 mg/kg or clarithromycin 15 mg/kg, 60 min before - Genitourinary and GI procedures None No longer recommended Lemierre syndrome (Fusobacterium necrophorum primarily, new reports with suspected.Anecdotal reports suggest metronidazole may be effective for apparent failures with other agents.

Posaconazole for prevention of infection has been well studied in adults (AI) and offers anti-mold coverage.4Fluconazole is not effective against molds and some strains of Candida. Posaconazole PO, voriconazole PO, and micafungin IV are effective in adults in preventing yeast and mold infections but are not well studied in children for this indication. 12 Prophylaxis of invasive fungal infection in patients with solid organ transplants13-17Fluconazole 6 mg/kg/day for prevention of infection (AII)AmB, caspofungin, micafungin, voriconazole, or posaconazole may be effective in infection. Treatment Aspergillosis1,18-29Voriconazole (AI) 18 mg/kg/day IV div q12h for a loading dose on the first day, then 16 mg/kg/day IV div q12h as a maintenance dose for children 2-12 y or 12-14 y and weighing ,50 kg. In children $15 y or 12-14 y and weighing .50 kg, use adult dosing (load 12 mg/kg/day IV div q12h on the first day, then 8 mg/kg/day div q12h as a maintenance dose) (AII). When stable, may switch from voriconazole IV to voriconazole PO at a dose of 18 mg/kg/day div bid for children 2-12 y and at least 400 mg/day div bid for children .12 y (AII). Dosing in children ,2 y is less clear, but doses are generally higher (AIII). These are only initial dosing recommendations; continued dosing in all ages is guided by close monitoring of trough serum voriconazole concentrations in individual patients (AII). Unlike in adults, voriconazole PO bioavailability in children is only approximately 50%-60%, so trough levels are crucial when using PO. 30 Alternatives for primary therapy when voriconazole cannot be administered: L-AmB 5 mg/kg/day (AII) or isavuconazole (AI). Dosing of isavuconazole in children is unknown. ABLC is another possible alternative. Echinocandin primary monotherapy should not be used for treating invasive aspergillosis (CII). AmB deoxycholate should be used only in resource-limited settings in which no alternative agent is available (AII). Voriconazole is the preferred primary antifungal therapy for all clinical forms of aspergillosis. Early initiation of therapy in patients with strong suspicion of disease is important while a diagnostic evaluation is conducted. Optimal voriconazole trough serum concentrations (generally thought to be 2-5 mcg/mL) are needed. Check trough level 2-5 days after initiation of therapy, and repeat the following week to verify and 4 days after a change of dose. 29 It is critical to monitor trough concentrations to guide therapy due to high inter-patient variability. 31 Low voriconazole concentrations are a leading cause of clinical failure. Younger children (especially ,3 y) often have lower trough voriconazole levels and need much higher dosing. Total treatment course is for a minimum of 6-12 wk, largely dependent on the degree and duration of immunosuppression and evidence of disease improvement. Salvage antifungal therapy options after failed primary therapy include a change of antifungal class (using L-AmB or an echinocandin), switching to isavuconazole, switching to posaconazole (serum trough concentrations $1 mcg/mL), or using combination antifungal therapy. Careful consideration has to be used before beginning azole therapy after a patient has failed azole prophylaxis. Combination antifungal therapy with voriconazole plus an echinocandin may be considered in select patients. The addition of anidulafungin to voriconazole as combination therapy found some statistical benefit to the combination over voriconazole monotherapy in only certain patients. 32 In vitro data suggest some synergy with 2 (but not 3) drug combinations: an azole plus an echinocandin is the most well studied. If combination therapy is employed, this is likely best done initially when voriconazole trough concentrations may not yet be appropriate. Routine antifungal susceptibility testing is not recommended but is suggested for patients suspected of having an azole-resistant isolate or who are unresponsive to therapy. Azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus is increasing. If local epidemiology suggests .10% azole resistance, empiric initial therapy should be voriconazole 1 echinocandin OR with L-AmB, and subsequent therapy guided based on antifungal susceptibilities. 33 Micafungin likely has equal efficacy to caspofungin against aspergillosis.34 Return of immune function is paramount to treatment success; for children receiving corticosteroids, decreasing the corticosteroid dosage or changing to steroid-sparing protocols important. ch08-Nelson-2019_155-172.indd 158 11/7/18 11:17 AM2019 Nelson's Pediatric Antimicrobial Therapy \u2014 159 Preferred Therapy for Specific Fungal Pathogens8B.

Fluconazole (12 mg/kg/day q24h, after a load of 25 mg/kg/day) is an alternative for patients who are not critically ill and have had no prior azole exposure (CIII). A fluconazole loading dose is standard of care in adult patients but has only been studied in infants 56\u2014it is likely that the beneficial effect of a loading dose extends to children. Fluconazole can be used as step-down therapy in stable neutropenic patients with susceptible isolates and documented bloodstream clearance (CIII). For children on ECMO, fluconazole is dosed as 35 mg/kg load on day 1 followed by 12 mg/kg/day (BII). 57 For non-neutropenic patients: An echinocandin is also recommended as initial therapy. Caspofungin 70 mg/m2 IV loading dose on day 1 (max dose 70 mg), followed by 50 mg/m2 IV (max dose 70 mg) on subsequent days (AII); OR micafungin 2 mg/kg/day q24h (children weighing ,40 kg), up to max dose 100 mg/day (AI). 43 Fluconazole (12 mg/kg/day IV or PO q24h, after a load of 25 mg/kg/day) is an acceptable alternative to an echinocandin as initial therapy in selected patients, including those who are not critically ill and who are considered unlikely to have a fluconazole-resistant Candida spp (AI). For children on ECMO, fluconazole is dosed as 35 mg/kg load followed by 12 mg/kg/day (BII). 57 Transition from an echinocandin to fluconazole (usually within 5-7 days) is recommended for non- neutropenic patients who are clinically stable, have isolates that are susceptible to fluconazole (eg, Candida albicans), and have negative repeat blood cultures following initiation of antifungal therapy (AII). For CNS infections: L-AmB/ABLC (5 mg/kg/day), and AmB-D (1 mg/kg/day) as an alternative, combined with or without flucytosine 100 mg/kg/day PO div q6h (AII) until initial clinical response, followed by step-down therapy with fluconazole (12 mg/kg/day q24h, after a load of 25 mg/kg/day); echinocandins do not achieve therapeutic concentrations in CSF.Prompt removal of infected IV catheter or any infected devices is absolutely critical to success (AII). For infections with Candida krusei or Candida glabrata, an echinocandin is preferred; however, there are increasing reports of some C glabrata resistance to echinocandins (treatment would, therefore, be lipid formulation AmB) (BIII). There are increasing reports of some Candida tropicalis resistance to fluconazole. Lipid formulation AmB (5 mg/kg daily) is a reasonable alternative if there is intolerance, limited availability, or resistance to other antifungal agents (AI). Transition from lipid AmB to fluconazole is recommended after 5-7 days among patients who have isolates that are susceptible to fluconazole, who are clinically stable, and in whom repeat cultures on antifungal therapy are negative (AI). Voriconazole (18 mg/kg/day div q12h load, followed by 16 mg/kg/day div q12h) is effective for candidemia but offers little advantage over fluconazole as initial therapy. Voriconazole is recommended as step-down oral therapy for selected cases of candidemia due to C krusei or if mold coverage is needed. Follow-up blood cultures should be performed every day or every other day to establish the time point at which candidemia has been cleared (AIII). Duration of therapy is for 2 wk AFTER negative cultures in pediatric patients without obvious metastatic complications and after symptom resolution (AII). In neutropenic patients, ophthalmologic findings of choroidal and vitreal infection are minimal until recovery from neutropenia; therefore, dilated funduscopic examinations should be performed within the first week after recovery from neutropenia (AIII). All non-neutropenic patients with candidemia should have a dilated ophthalmologic examination, preferably performed by an ophthalmologist, within the first week after diagnosis (AIII). - Disseminated, chronic (hepatosplenic) infectionInitial therapy with lipid formulation AmB (5 mg/kg daily) OR an echinocandin (caspofungin 70 mg/m 2 IV loading dose on day 1 [max dose 70 mg], followed by 50 mg/m2 IV [max dose 70 mg] on subsequent days OR micafungin 2 mg/kg/day q24h in children weighing ,40 kg [max dose 100 mg]) for several weeks, followed by oral fluconazole in patients unlikely to have a fluconazole-resistant isolate (12 mg/kg/day q24h, after a load of 25 mg/ kg/day) (AIII). Therapy should continue until lesions resolve on repeat imaging, which is usually several months. Premature discontinuation of antifungal therapy can lead to relapse (AIII).

Voriconazole is recommended as step-down oral therapy for selected cases of candidemia due to C krusei or if mold coverage is needed. Follow-up blood cultures should be performed every day or every other day to establish the time point at which candidemia has been cleared (AIII). Duration of therapy is for 2 wk AFTER negative cultures in pediatric patients without obvious metastatic complications and after symptom resolution (AII). In neutropenic patients, ophthalmologic findings of choroidal and vitreal infection are minimal until recovery from neutropenia; therefore, dilated funduscopic examinations should be performed within the first week after recovery from neutropenia (AIII). All non-neutropenic patients with candidemia should have a dilated ophthalmologic examination, preferably performed by an ophthalmologist, within the first week after diagnosis (AIII). - Disseminated, chronic (hepatosplenic) infectionInitial therapy with lipid formulation AmB (5 mg/kg daily) OR an echinocandin (caspofungin 70 mg/m 2 IV loading dose on day 1 [max dose 70 mg], followed by 50 mg/m2 IV [max dose 70 mg] on subsequent days OR micafungin 2 mg/kg/day q24h in children weighing ,40 kg [max dose 100 mg]) for several weeks, followed by oral fluconazole in patients unlikely to have a fluconazole-resistant isolate (12 mg/kg/day q24h, after a load of 25 mg/ kg/day) (AIII). Therapy should continue until lesions resolve on repeat imaging, which is usually several months. Premature discontinuation of antifungal therapy can lead to relapse (AIII). If chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplantation is required, it should not be delayed because of the presence of chronic disseminated candidiasis, and antifungal therapy should be continued throughout the period of high risk to prevent relapse (AIII). ch08-Nelson-2019_155-172.indd 163 11/7/18 11:17 AM164 \u2014 Chapter 8.

Alphabetic Listing of Antimicrobials NOTES Higher dosages in a dose range are generally indicated for more serious infections. For pathogens with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations against beta-lactam antibiot-ics, a more prolonged infusion of the antibiotic will allow increased antibacterial effect (see Chapter 3). Maximum dosages for adult-sized children (eg, $ 40 kg) are based on US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved product labeling or post-marketing data. Antiretroviral medications are not listed in this chapter. See Chapter 9. Drugs with FDA-approved dosage, or dosages based on randomized clinical trials, are given a Level of Evidence I. Dosages for which data are collected from non comparative trials or small comparative trials are given a Level of Evidence II. Dosages based on expert or consensus opinion or case reports are given a Level of Evidence III. If no oral liquid form is available, round the child's dose to a combination of available solid dosage forms. Consult a pediatric pharmacist for recommendations on mix-ing with food (eg, crushing tablets, emptying capsule contents) and the availability of extemporaneously compounded liquid formulations. Cost estimates are in US dollars per course, or per month for maintenance regimens. Estimates are based on wholesale acquisition costs at the editor's institution. These may differ from that of the reader. Legend: $ 5 ,$100, 5 .$10,000. There are some agents that we do not recommend even though they may be available. We believe they are significantly inferior to those we do recommend (see chapters 5-10) and could possibly lead to poor outcomes if used. Such agents are not listed.

Antibiotic Therapy for Children Who Are Obese When prescribing an antimicrobial for a child who is obese or overweight, selecting a dose based on milligrams per kilograms of total body weight (TBW) may overexpose the child if the drug doesn't freely distribute into fat tissue. Conversely, underexposure can occur when a dosage is reduced for obesity for drugs without distribution limitations. The Table lists major antimicrobials classes and our suggestion on how to calculate an appropriate dose. The evidence to support these recommendations are Level II-III (phar - macokinetic studies in children, extrapolations from adult studies, and expert opinion). Whenever a dose is used that is greater than one prospectively investigated for efficacy and safety, the clinician must weigh the benefits with potential risks. Data are not avail-able on all agents. For gentamicin, using the child's fat-free mass, an approximate 30% reduction in dosing weight, has been recommended. When performing this empiric dosing strategy with aminoglycosides in children who are obese, we recommend closely following serum concentrations. Vancomycin is traditionally dosed based on TBW in obese adults due to increases in kidney size and glomerular filtration rate. In obese children, weight-adjusted distribution volume and clearance are slightly lower than in their nonobese counterparts. An empiric maximum dose of 60 mg/kg/day based on TBW , or dosing using body surface area, may be more appropriate. We recommend closely following serum concentrations. In the setting of cephalosporins for surgical prophylaxis (see Chapter 14), adult studies of obese patients have generally found that distribution to the subcutaneous fat tissue target is subtherapeutic when standard doses are used. Given the wide safety margin of these agents in the short-term setting of surgical prophylaxis, maximum single doses are rec-ommended in obese adults (eg, cefazolin 2-3 g instead of the standard 1 g) with re-dosing at 4-hour intervals for longer cases. In obese children, we recommend dosing cephalo-sporins for surgical prophylaxis based on TBW up to the adult maximum. In critically ill obese adults, extended infusion times have been shown to increase the likelihood of achieving therapeutic serum concentrations with carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam. Daptomycin dosing can be performed using TBW , but the maximum dose should be 500 mg for skin infections and 750 mg for bloodstream infections. Bolus administration over 2 minutes can improve the likelihood of achieving target concentrations in cases where the maximum dose is less than the calculated dose in an obese adolescent. ch12-Nelson-2019_241-244.indd 241 11/7/18 12:49 PM242 \u2014 Chapter 12.

Sequential Parenteral-Oral Antibiotic Therapy (Oral Step-down Therapy) for Serious Infections The concept of oral step-down therapy is not new; evidence-based recommendations from Nelson and colleagues appeared 40 years ago in the Journal of Pediatrics.1,2 Bone and joint infections,3-5 complicated bacterial pneumonia with empyema,6 deep-tissue abscesses, and appendicitis,7,8 as well as cellulitis or pyelonephritis,9 may require initial parenteral therapy to control the growth and spread of pathogens and minimize injury to tissues. For abscesses in soft tissues, joints, bones, and empyema, most organisms are removed by surgical drainage and, presumably, killed by the initial parenteral therapy. When the signs and symptoms of infection begin to resolve, often within 2 to 4 days, continuing intravenous (IV) therapy may not be required, as a normal host neutrophil response begins to assist in clearing the infection. 10 In addition to following the clinical response prior to oral switch, following objective laboratory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) or procalcitonin (PCT), during the hospitalization may also help the clini-cian better assess the response to antibacterial therapy, particularly in the infant or child who is difficult to examine. 11,12 For many children who are documented to have successful treatment with step-down oral therapy following drainage of abscesses, it is likely that a proportion may actually no longer require any additional antibiotic therapy. 13 However, defining those children who may benefit from oral step-down therapy is difficult, as the extent of a deep infection, the adequacy of source control (drainage), and the susceptibil-ity of pathogen(s) involved are not always known. For the beta-lactam class of antibiotics, absorption of orally administered antibiotics in standard dosages provides peak serum concentrations that are routinely only 5% to 20% of those achieved with IV or intramuscular administration. However, high-dose oral beta-lactam therapy provides the tissue antibiotic exposure thought to be required to eradicate the remaining pathogens at the infection site as the tissue perfusion improves. For beta-lactams, begin with a dosage 2 to 3 times the normal dosage (eg, 75-100 mg/kg/day of amoxicillin or 100 oral beta-lactam antibiotic therapy of osteoarticular infections has been associated with treatment success since 1978. 3 It is reassuring that high-quality retrospective cohort data have recently confirmed similar outcomes achieved in those treated with oral step-down therapy compared with those treated with IV . 14 High-dose prolonged oral beta-lactam therapy may be associated with reversible neutropenia; checking for hematologic toxicity every few weeks during therapy is recommended. 15 Clindamycin and many antibiotics of the fluoroquinolone class (ciprofloxacin, levo-floxacin) and oxazolidinone class (linezolid, tedizolid) have excellent absorption of their oral formulations and provide virtually the same tissue antibiotic exposure at a particular mg/kg dose, compared with that dose given intravenously. Trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole and metronidazole are 12:52 PM13 Sequential Parenteral-Oral Antibiotic Therapy Serious Infections246 \u2014 Chapter 13. Sequential Parenteral-Oral Antibiotic Therapy (Oral Step-down Therapy) for Serious Infections One must also assume that the parent and child are compliant with the administration of each antibiotic dose, that the oral antibiotic will be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the systemic circulation (no vomiting or diarrhea), and that the parents will seek medical care if the clinical course does not continue to improve for their child. Monitor the child clinically for a continued response on oral therapy; follow CRP or PCT after the switch to oral therapy and if there are concerns about continued response, make sure the antibiotic and dosage you selected are appropriate and the family is compliant. In one of the first published series of oral step-down therapy for osteoarticular infection, failures caused by presumed noncompliance were reported. 16 ch13-Nelson-2019_245-246.indd 246 11/7/18 Antimicrobial Therapy of Symptomatic Infection 14 14. Antimicrobial Prophylaxis/Prevention of Symptomatic Infection This chapter provides a summary of recommendations for prophylaxis of infections, defined as providing therapy prior to the onset of clinical signs or symptoms of infection. Prophylaxis can be considered in several clinical scenarios. A. Postexposure Antimicrobial Prophylaxis to Prevent Infection Given for a relatively short, specified period after exposure to specific pathogens/organisms, where the risks of acquiring the infection are felt to justify antimicrobial treatment to eradicate the pathogen or prevent symptomatic infection in situations in which the child (healthy or with increased susceptibility to infection) is likely to have been inoculated/exposed (eg, asymptomatic child closely exposed to meningococcus; a neonate born to a mother with active genital herpes simplex virus). B. Long-term Antimicrobial Prophylaxis to Prevent Symptomatic New Infection Given to a particular, defined population of children who are of relatively high risk of acquiring a severe infection from a single or multiple exposures (eg, a child postsple-nectomy; a child with documented rheumatic heart disease to prevent subsequent streptococcal infection), with prophylaxis provided during the period of risk, poten-tially months or years. C. Prophylaxis of Symptomatic Disease in Children Who Have Asymptomatic Infection/ Latent Infection Where a child has a documented but asymptomatic infection and targeted antimicro- bials are given to prevent the development of symptomatic disease (eg, latent tubercu-losis infection or therapy of a stem cell transplant patient with documented cytomega-lovirus viremia but no symptoms of infection or rejection; to prevent reactivation of herpes simplex virus). Treatment period is usually defined, particularly in situations in which the latent infection can be cured (tuberculosis), but other circumstances, such as reactivation of a latent virus, may require months or years of prophylaxis. D. Surgical/Procedure Prophylaxis A child receives a surgical/invasive catheter procedure, planned or unplanned, in which the risk of infection postoperatively or post-procedure may justify prophylaxis to prevent an infection from occurring (eg, prophylaxis to prevent infection following spinal rod placement). Treatment is usually short-term, beginning just prior to the procedure and ending at the conclusion of the procedure, or within 24 to 48 hours. E. Travel-Related Exposure Prophylaxis Not discussed in this chapter; please refer to information on specific disease entities (eg, traveler's diarrhea, chapters 6 and 10) or specific pathogens (eg, malaria, Chap-ter 10). Constantly updated, current information for travelers about prophylaxis and current worldwide infection risks can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Web site at www.cdc.gov/travel (accessed October 6, 2018). ch14-Nelson-2019_247-262.indd 247 11/12/18 2:53 PM248 \u2014 Chapter 14.

POSTEXPOSURE ANTIMICROBIAL PROPHYLAXIS TO PREVENT INFECTION Prophylaxis Category Therapy (evidence grade) Comments Bacterial Bites, see Chapter 1 for amox/clav description) for 3-5 days (AII) OR ampicillin and clindamycin (BII). For penicillin allergy, consider ciprofloxacin (for Pasteurella) plus clindamycin (BIII).Recommended for children who (1) are immunocompro - mised; (2) are asplenic; (3) have moderate to severe inju- ries, especially to the hand or face; or (4) have injuries that may have penetrated the periosteum or joint cap - sule (AII). 3 Consider rabies prophylaxis for at-risk animal bites (AI)6; consider tetanus prophylaxis.7 Human bites have a very high rate of infection (do not close open wounds routinely). Cat bites have a higher rate of infection than dog bites.Staphylococcus aureus coverage is only fair with amox/clav and provides no coverage for MRSA. Endocarditis prophylaxis 8,9: Given that (1) endocarditis is rarely caused by dental/GI procedures and (2) prophylaxis for procedures prevents an exceedingly small number of cases, the risks of antibiotics most often outweigh benefits. However, some \"highest risk\" conditions are currently recommended for prophylaxis: (1) prosthetic heart valve (or prosthetic material used to repair a valve); (2) previous endocarditis; (3) cyanotic congenital heart disease that is unrepaired (or palliatively repaired with shunts and conduits); (4) congenital heart disease that is repaired but with defects at the site of repair adjacent to prosthetic material; (5) completely repaired congenital heart disease using prosthetic material, for the first 6 months after repair; or (6) cardiac transplant patients with valvulopathy. Routine prophylaxis no longer is required for children with native valve abnormalities. Follow-up data in children suggest that following these new guidelines, no increase in endocarditis has been detected, 10 but in adults in the United States11 and in the United Kingdom,12 some concern for increase in the number of cases of endocarditis has been documented since widespread prophylaxis was stopped. More recent data from California and New York do not support an increase in infective endocarditis with the current approach to prophylaxis.13 ch14-Nelson-2019_247-262.indd 249 11/12/18 2:53 PM250 \u2014 Chapter 14.

To prevent recurrent infections, as alternative to antibiotic prophy - laxis, also consider the risks and benefits of placing tympanostomy tubes to improve middle ear ventilation.

However, antimicrobial prophylaxis may alter the nasopharyngeal flora and foster colonization with resistant organ- isms, compromising long-term efficacy of the prophylactic drug. Continuous PO-administered antimicrobial prophylaxis should be reserved for control of recurrent acute otitis media, only when defined as $3 distinct and well-documented episodes during a period of 6 mo or $4 episodes during a period of 12 mo. Although prophylactic administration of an antimicrobial agent limited to a period when a person is at high risk of otitis media has been sug- gested (eg, during acute viral respiratory tract infection), this method has not been evaluated critically.

SURGICAL/PROCEDURE PROPHYLAXIS37-47 The CDC National Healthcare Safety Network uses a classification of surgical procedure-related wound infections based on an estimation of the load of bacterial contamination: Class I, clean; Class II, clean-contaminated; Class III, contaminated; and Class IV, dirty/infected.38,43,44 Other major factors creating risk for postoperative surgical site infection include the duration of surgery (a longer-duration operation, defined as one that exceeded the 75th percentile for a given procedure) and the medical comorbidities of the patient, as determined by an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of III, IV, or V (presence of severe systemic disease that results in functional limitations, is life-threatening, or is expected to preclude survival from the operation). The virulence/pathogenicity of bacteria inoculated and the presence of foreign debris/devitalized tissue/surgical material in the wound are also considered risk factors for infection. For all categories of surgical prophylaxis, dosing recommendations are derived from (1) choosing agents based on the organisms likely to be responsible for inoculation of the surgical site; (2) giving the agents at an optimal time (,60 min for cefazolin, or ,60 to 120 min for vancomy - cin and ciprofloxacin) before starting the operation to achieve appropriate serum and tissue exposures at the time of incision; (3) providing addi- tional doses during the procedure at times based on the standard dosing guideline for that agent; and (4) stopping the agents at the end of the procedure or for no longer than 24-48 h after the end of the procedure. 39-42,45-47 Optimal duration of prophylaxis after delayed sternal or abdomi- nal closure is not well defined in adults or children.

Alternatively, Mosteller's formula can be used. 1.3080 70 60 50 40 30 25 20 15 10 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.01.20 1.10 1.00 .90 .80 .70 .60 .55 .50 .45 .40 .35 .30 .25 .20 .15 .10240180 160 140 130 120 110 100 90 80 70 60 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 18 16 14 12 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 390 2.0 1.9 1.8 1.7 1.6 1.5 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.1 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.180 6070 50 3040 20 15 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2220 200 190 180 170 160 150 140 130 120 110 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 3085 80 75 70 65 55 50 45 40 35 30 28 26 24 22 20 18 17 16 15 14 13 121960cm in lb m2kgFor children of normal height for weight Weight in pounds Surface area in square metersHeight Weight Height (cm) x Weight (kg) 3600Alternative (Mosteller's formula) : Surface area (m2) = Nomogram Nelson's Pediatric Antimicrobial Therapy \u2014 265 References References Chapter 1 1.
