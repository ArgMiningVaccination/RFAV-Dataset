Take a look at what our patients have to say: Leslie Denver, CO Dr. Fox is wonderful! She listened to my concerns and pursued a very thorough work up in order to determine the causes of my medical concerns. She bases her plan on scientific data and did not blame my symptoms solely on working too much or being too stressed out. I had never had another doctor actually take the time to perform lab work and create a long term plan for optimal health. I cannot offer enough gratitude and thanks to her for all she has done for me. Christine Louisville, CO Amy Reidhead is my go-to miracle worker. She is an exceptionally skilled practitioner of functional medicine, acupuncture and chiropractic medicine. During my first visit, Dr. Reidhead totally alleviated my chronic sciatica. On subsequent visits, she has helped with bursitis in my hip, a torn gluteus minimus, and lower back pain. Dr. Reidhead listens and has the training and multiple modalities to apply just the right treatment. I highly recommend her for your consideration.
