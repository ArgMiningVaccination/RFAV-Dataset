Because the different autoimmune diseases affect specific organ systems, patients are often shunted to specialists who approach these conditions through their relatively narrow specialty lenses. Though they may manifest differently, most autoimmune diseases have the same common triggers. If we know what causes the immune system to attack itself and we can identify some of the triggers causing a malfunction in the immune system, we can successfully treat many seemingly different disorders using a similar approach. In this free webinar, Michael Jurgelewicz, DC, CNS, will discuss an integrated treatment approach for autoimmune and gastrointestinal disorders, using case studies from his own clinical practice to illustrate the key points. You'll learn about: How to identify environmental triggers that contribute to autoimmunity The role of clinical laboratory testing to assess autoimmune dysfunction Comprehensive molecular evaluation of the gut microbiome, gut inflammation, mucosal immunity, and digestive function. Assessment of opportunistic bacterial, protozoal, and viral pathogens, as well beneficial microorganisms organisms Dietary interventions and nutritional therapies for patients presenting with autoimmune disorders Michael Jurgelewicz, DC, DACBN, DCBCN, CNS is the founder and director of Bucks County Center for Functional Medicine in Yardley, PA.

A massive new study of data from over 19,000 individuals shows that chronic pain is associated with loss of hippocampal volume and increased risk of dementia. Compared with pain-free control subjects, those who had five or more areas of chronic pain showed neurological changes equivalent to eight years of excess brain aging (Zhao W, et al. PNAS. 2023). Simply put, the more regions of chronic pain people experience, the greater their risk of neurocognitive abnormalities. \"Our results suggested that cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy interact biologically and may underlie the increased risk of dementia associated with multi-site chronic pain (MCP),\" write Zhao and colleagues, based at the CAS Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing. Zhao's team used data from the UK Biobank, concentrating specifically on files from more than 19,000 individuals who'd undergone brain scans. The chronic pain problems in this large cohort were the result of a wide variety of causes, including arthritis, cancer, and low back pain. Regardless of the specific causes, the brain impact of chronic pain was consistent. \"We found that individuals with MCP were associated with significantly higher dementia risk, broader and faster cognitive impairment, and greater hippocampal atrophy than both pain-free (PF) individuals and those with single-site chronic pain (SCP),\" the authors note. The impact of chronic pain on hippocampal volume and dementia risk correlated strongly with number of coexistent chronic pain sites, and the observed hippocampal atrophy was associated with measurable declines in fluid intelligence. \"Our results suggested that cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy interact biologically and may underlie the increased risk of dementia associated with multi-site chronic pain (MCP)\" \u2014Wenhui Zhao, Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing In other words, constant pain in multiple anatomical sites leads to detrimental brain changes and impairs cognitive function. One in Five These findings should prompt physicians in this country to sit up and pay attention. Those numbers are telling us something: conventional medicine, with its limited tool kit for managing pain, is not doing a very good job. Most physicians rely on NSAIDs, acetaminophen, antiepileptic drugs, and serotonin/dopamine agents when treating people who live with chronic pain. Or they refer these patients out for surgery. The stats from the CDC and other sources show us clearly that this isn't working. And in light of the Zhao study, our system's failure to properly address chronic pain has long term negative implications for cognitive health. This article will review three key areas: A quick overview on how we can do better in eliminating pain Key tools for preventing dementia in general Use of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) to prevent pain-induced dementia Secrets to Pain Relief People do best with a comprehensive approach to pain management. This means addressing: The biochemistry of pain, via diet and nutrient interventions, herbs, and in some cases, prescription medications The structural components of pain, via osteopathy, myofascial release, and chiropractic Mind/body/spirit aspects of pain, via techniques to release old emotions stored in muscles and the brain, and by eliminating things that are a \"pain in the back\" (or even lower!) We will focus here on the biochemistry of pain relief, and dementia prevention. Why Do We Have Pain? The first step in eliminating pain is to realize that pain is not meant to be an enemy. Rather, it is like the warning light on a car's dashboard telling us that something needs attention. When someone's \"oil light\" goes on, in the form of a chronic pain, the standard medical response is to prescribe a drug or undertake a surgical procedure to make the warning signal disappear. And then, when the patient's \"motor\" burns out, they think it was just coincidence. But what if, instead, we treated the flashing oil light by actually adding oil? This works wonderfully! What is Pain Asking For? There are several pain-associated biochemical warning lights that are asking for different things. The most common ones are: Low tissue energy: When muscles don't have enough energy, they get locked into shortened positions, causing pain. It takes more energy for a muscle to relax, than to contract. This may seem counterintuitive, but consider how your muscles feel after a heavy workout. They don't go loose and limp, rather they become tight. Chronic low tissue energy causes myofascial pain, and this is present in most cases of chronic pain, even if it is not the original cause of the pain. Inflammation or immune imbalance: This is generally present in all conditions that end in \"-itis,\" such as arthritis. It is also present in many autoimmune illnesses. For arthritis, the herbal mixture Curaphen was as effective as Celexicob in head-on studies. Glucosamine and chondroitin was also highly effective, likely by feeding the joints the substrates they need to build and maintain cartilage. Nerve pain: Interestingly, this is associated with uncontrolled firing of pacemaker-like cells, which then also deplete energy. Common triggers include nutritional deficiencies, low cellular energy from diabetes, fibromyalgia or hypothyroidism, and infections. Lipoic acid, 300 mg, twice daily and Acetyl-L-carnitine, 1000 mg, can be helpful in mitigating nerve pain, though it usually takes at least three months of regular use. Central or brain pain: This is triggered by most other types of chronic pain, and it is associated with microglial activation (discussed below). Shutting down the microglial activation with low-dose naltrexone or other treatments can be very beneficial. Sympathetically Maintained Pain/Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS): According to the International Association for the Study of Pain, sympathetically maintained pain is, \"a type of pain that is maintained by sympathetic efferent innervation or by circulating catecholamines.\" It can occur by itself or in conjunction with other types of pain. CRPS, formerly called \"Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy\" is one form of it. This can be extremely debilitating. Management of CRPS is beyond the scope of this article but suffice to say the condition is now treatable. Feel free to email me at fatiguedoc@gmail.com for a CRPS information sheet outlining my approach. The CDC estimated that fully one in five adults experienced chronic pain in 2021. The numbers are telling us something: conventional medicine, with its limited tool kit for managing pain, is not doing a very good job. Basics for Pain Relief In general, when treating chronic pain, I start with general nutritional and herbal support. Especially important is to ensure that the patient is getting high levels of B vitamins and magnesium to restore tissue energy. Then, omega-3s and herbs to balance inflammation. For the omega 3 support I use EurOmega 3, as one pill replaces seven large fish oil pills or capsules. I also then add Curaphen1-2 caps 3 x day. This pain relief formula contains a unique highly absorbable form of curcumin to balance cyclooxygenase (COX), boswellia to balance lipoxygenase (LOX), DL phenylalanine (DLPA) to increase endorphins, and nattokinase to mitigate inflammation and oxidative stress. For arthritis or traumatic pain, I add a topical Comfrey (Symphytum) cream three times a day. Give this and the Curaphen for six weeks to see the full effect. These products can be combined, and also taken with other pain medications. It is remarkable how much research shows that the risk of dementia can be dramatically decreased via nutritional, botanical, and lifestyle interventions. And conventional medicine largely ignores all of this because the treatments are not expensive pharmaceuticals. There are many things that can help. Here are some basics, organized around the mnemonic \"MIND\": METABOLIC- The key here is to optimize hormone levels with bioidentical hormone therapies. For example, thyroid hormone levels are strongly associated with risk of dementia. But there are gender differences in how this relationship plays out. In women, low-normal thyroid levels are associated with a 240% higher risk of dementia. In men, borderline elevated thyroid levels raise dementia risk by 800%! Testosterone levels also influence risk of dementia, with low testosterone increasing it while higher levels seem to be protective. A 50% increase in free testosterone in the bloodstream was associated with a 26% decrease in the risk of Alzheimer's. Men who develop Alzheimer's disease have about half the free testosterone in their bloodstreams as men who do not. INFECTIONS- Always check for silent bladder infections. Also consider candida, if a patient is experiencing a lot of postnasal drip, throat clearing, or flatulence. Chronic infections are associated with increased risk of dementia. NUTRITIONAL Support- Beyond the basics of a healthy plant-rich diet, and the support of a good multivitamin, it is important to optimize folate, B12, other B vitamins, and Vitamin D. When working with chronic pain patients, always check the B12 level. You want to keep that over 540 ng/L. Also look at the homocysteine level. Ideally, that should be under 9 \u00b5mol/L. The value of B vitamins in preventing dementia have been shown in a number of studies. For example, in the 2012 VITACOG study, people with mild cognitive impairment who took a daily combination of 0.8 mg folic acid, 0.5 mg vitamin B12, and 20 mg vitamin B6 showed markedly slower rates of cognitive decline and less brain atrophy than those assigned to the placebo group. VITAMIN D is also very important, as was shown in a prospective study of over 12,000 individuals published earlier this year. Researchers at the University of Calgary found that, \"Across all formulations, vitamin D exposure was associated with significantly longer dementia-free survival and lower dementia incidence rate than no exposure.\" In the population as a whole, taking vitamin D was associated with a 40% lower incidence of dementia. The effect was significantly stronger in females versus males. It was also greater in those who had normal cognition at baseline compared with those who already had some degree of cognitive impairment. Likewise, the protective effect seemed stronger in non-carriers of the apolipoprotein E 4 allele versus carriers of this risk factor. Be careful with iron, especially in carriers of the apolipoprotein E 4 allele. According to researchers at the University of Melbourne, the presence of this gene tends to elevate ferritin levels in cerebrospinal fluid, and this is associated with declines in cognitive performance and increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Do not supplement with iron if someone's ferritin level is over 60 \u00b5g/L. Curcumin (turmeric), a culinary favorite, appears to be neuroprotective. It is notable that the prevalence of Alzheimer's in India\u2014where curcumin is a dietary mainstay- is 70% lower than in the US. Curcumin also shows promise in many neurodegenerative conditions, including Parkinson's. Supplementation with curcumin makes sense for people at increased risk of cognitive decline. But this is one herb for which the form and brand really matter. I recommend a highly absorbable form of Curcumin called CuraPro, 750 mg, twice daily. Be Cautious with Meds Yes, pharmaceuticals are sometimes necessary for prevention or treatment of serious illnesses. There's no question that drugs to control blood pressure, especially beta blockers and ACE inhibitors, can be protective for the brain in patients who have hypertension. But it is equally important that we get our patients off unneeded or harmful drugs as often as we can. Avoid Proton Pump Inhibitors: In a 2016 study of over 73,000 elderly individuals, taking a PPI such as omeprazole and pantoprazole was associated with a 44% increase in dementia risk. Famotidine, an H2 receptor antagonist, does not seem to carry a similar risk. Avoid Anticholinergic Drugs: Diphenhydramine, tricyclic antidepressants, and incontinence drugs like oxybutynin tolterodine are especially problematic. In a study of 451 older individuals, cognitively normal at baseline, the use of anticholinergic drugs markedly increased risk of brain atrophy and cognitive impairment. The risk increase begins with as little as 60 days' exposure. Low-Dose Naltrexone As noted at the beginning of this article, chronic pain is associated with decreased brain volume and increased dementia risk. I believe low-dose naltrexone (LDN)\u2014an old and inexpensive therapy-could potentially prevent millions of cases of dementia by alleviating chronic pain. Why? Because LDN addresses one of the main drivers of both chronic pain and brain atrophy. Numerous studies show that microglial activation is a common denominator between chronic pain, fibromyalgia, and shrinking brain size. Researchers now recognize that microglial activation could be a potential target for pain management. Microglial cells can be viewed as the brains \"gardeners.\" Normally they are mild-mannered, and simply tend to the needs of brain cells. They provide a first line of immune defense, and they are constantly \"weeding\" the brain of damaged neurons or potentially problematic amyloid buildup. But when something goes amiss in the brain, such as a viral infection or a chronic pain problem, these mild-mannered gardeners can become overactive and they start damaging healthy brain tissue. This microglial activation contributes to brain shrinkage and decreased volume. The remedy? LDN! At doses of 3-5 mg per night, LDN turns off microglial activation. This approach was outlined in a 2019 paper by Diana Trofimovitch and Steven Baumrucker, who propose the off-label use of LDN to manage non-malignant pain. \"When used in doses of 1 to 5 mg, it acts as a glial modulator with a neuroprotective effect via inhibition of microglial activation.\" LDN has been shown in numerous studies, and borne out by wide clinical experience, to help eliminate pain and other debilitating symptoms of chronic pain conditions. There is a high probability that by shutting down the microglial activation, it can also prevent the increased dementia risk associated with chronic pain (See Low-Dose NTX to Quell Chronic Pain & Lower Risk of Dementia) For information on how to treat fibromyalgia, long Covid symptoms, and other chronic pain syndromes, feel free to email me at FatigueDoc@gmail.com and ask for my free information sheets.

Long-haul Covid has unique features, but essentially, it is a variant of post-viral syndrome. That's good news because many of the features of post-viral syndrome are easily treated. Between 20% and 25% of all Covid patients have persistent symptoms of some sort. Those numbers are similar to what we see with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and mononucleosis; roughly 25% of college students who get mono develop chronic fatigue. There are similar patterns with other infections, such as Avian flu. This is just what you see after certain kinds of viruses. Post-Covid symptoms are diverse. For some it's persistent loss of smell, or chronic fatigue and muscle pain. For others its brain fog and cognitive impairment, or chronic respiratory problems. But the \"official\" definition of long-haul is simply any symptom after the acute phase. Everything gets lumped together. That's absurd, because the patterns are not the same. I have been researching post-viral syndromes and working with patients affected by them for the last 45 years. My interest emerged from personal experience: I had post-viral complications back in 1975. The resulting chronic fatigue sidelined me for almost a year during med school. Between 20% and 25% of all Covid patients have persistent symptoms of some sort. Those numbers are similar to what we see with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and mononucleosis. Over the years, I developed a comprehensive approach I call the SHINE Protocol. The acronym stands for: Sleep, Hormones, Infections, Nutrition, and Exercise. By addressing these five domains, we can greatly improve the health of people with post-viral CFS. Much of what we've learned from CFS is applicable to post-Covid patients. SHINE includes supplements, botanicals, hormonal therapies and in some cases, antivirals, antifungals, antidepressants, and drugs for sleep. The basic protocol includes a multivitamin, magnesium plus malic acid, melatonin, and a Valerian/Melissa combination. But there are many additional options depending on an individual's test results and clinical history. When a patient comes in saying, \"I still feel lousy,\" months after Covid, the first step is to characterize the symptom patterns. They typically fall into one of the following patterns: Fatigue, brain fog, achiness, poor non-restorative sleep: This is the majority of long Covid patients. They experience extreme fatigue, yet they don't sleep well. Energy is low; thinking and memory are foggy. Some have muscle pain. This is classic post-viral CFS. The basic SHINE protocol works well here. For post-viral CFS, 91% of people will improve if they follow it closely. Pneumonia, respiratory distress, \"shock lung\": Some patients have long-term respiratory symptoms, especially if they had severe lung involvement during the acute phase. Again, this is not unique to Covid. Other viruses can also trigger shock lung. It usually improves on its own over time, but it can cause a lot of distress. For these patients, I recommend a highly-absorbed form of curcumin, and a reduced glutathione to turn off the inflammation and the oxidative stress. And also, low-dose naltrexone to turn off the microglial activation. Some people experience difficulty breathing in the absence of actual lung damage. A pulse oximeter-available for about $25 on Amazon\u2014is a valuable tool. If someone feels short of breath, but oxygen levels are OK, the problem is likely due to vagal inflammation, not permanent alveolar damage. This occurs in roughly 27% of long-haulers. What happens is the inflamed vagus signals the diaphragm to tighten, causing a sensation of constriction. It's alarming but it does not mean there's an oxygen deficit. An oximeter can assure that oxygen is sufficient despite the sensation. This can avert panic and hyperventilation. Cardiac involvement: If a patient had cardiovascular problems tied to Covid, and shows residual impairment, think about treating with coenzyme Q10, acetyl carnitine, magnesium, and D-ribose. This needs to be coordinated with whatever conventional therapies the patient was prescribed by his/her cardiologist. Here, too, pulse oximetry provides insight. If someone has an oxygen saturation of 93 at rest, and then it drops when they walk, that's a sure sign there is actual cardiac or lung involvement, and not just vagal nerve inflammation. Loss of smell and/or taste: This is a unique feature of Covid. While many patients find that the problem resolves over a few months, for others it persists. These patients will benefit from 25-50 mg of zinc. Smell and taste are highly dependent on zinc, and also vitamin A. These two nutrients work together. For men, I recommend 8,000 IU per day of retinol. That's safe for men, but could potentially cause birth defects if a woman gets pregnant. The minimum RDA for vitamin A is about 3,000 IU for men, and 2,500 IU for women. So, 8,000 is not exactly a megadose. But I don't recommend it for women. Direct Brain involvement: Brain fog often follows Covid, and is part post-viral syndromes in general. If someone has brain fog alone, and not fatigue or other symptoms, it suggests direct brain involvement. In these cases, curcumin, antioxidants, and low-dose naltrexone are helpful. I give 750-1,500 mg of curcumin twice daily, and clinical glutathione twice daily, for 2-3 months. It's like putting out a fire\u2014we have to quench inflammation and oxidative stress. A small number of people have post-Covid encephalopathy, clots, or stroke. For them, conventional medicine is the best way to go. Allostatic Load & Long-Haul Risk Severe stress during the initial viral phase raises the odds of long-haul. If someone is not able to rest while ill with Covid, this also raises risk. It's all about allostatic load\u2014the total stress index. When you get beyond a certain stress level, you trip a hypothalamic circuit-breaker which controls sleep, hormones, and autonomic function. Once you trigger that circuit-breaker, you get CFS and fibromyalgia. Energy drops, you experience insomnia and/or non-restorative sleep. Helping People Sleep Sleep problems are common in post-viral syndromes. In most cases, this is not due to poor sleep hygiene but rather to hypothalamic dysfunction. As a holistic practitioner, you probably have some preferred sleep supplements and herbs that you recommend. I find sustained release melatonin to be helpful. I also formulated a mix of six ingredients (Valerian, Passionflower, Hops, Lemon Balm, 5-HTP, and L-theanine) that can be helpful. There are lots of natural options. Herbs tend to help people stay asleep, but they do not always help people fall asleep. So, many of these patients will need prescription drugs in addition to natural remedies. I use Trazadone (25-50 mg), Cyclobenzaprine (2.0 to 2.5 mg), and Gabapentin (100-300 mg). Zolpidem (Ambien) may also be helpful, at low doses of 5-10 mg. I keep doses low\u2014just enough to get the desired effect. Tiny doses of several things, instead of high doses of one, will create an additive effect without the 'hangover' the next day. It's akin to the traditional Chinese medicine approach of using small amounts of different herbs. This is how it should be with prescription drugs too, especially in this population, because they often have trouble detoxing drugs. Because they're not sleeping well, many of these patients lack energy during the day. Rather than caffeine or pharmaceutical stimulants, I recommend a form of Red Ginseng known as HRG80. It is hydroponically grown, so it is much less expensive than wild Ginseng, and it is very high in active constituents. I take it myself, and I'm very impressed. I studied it in 188 post-viral fatigue patients, 60% of whom improved. There was quite a dramatic increase in energy and stamina. Mitigating Viral Reactivation There are some viruses that the body kills off totally, and others like herpes, chicken pox, and EBV that the body never fully eliminates. The reasons for that are not clear. But when immunity goes down, you see a jailbreak, and these other viruses reactivate. For example, shingles is a jailbreak of the chicken pox virus. It shows up in the skin, and it is very obvious, so mainstream medicine can't ignore it. A similar process happens in other bodily systems, but instead of a big rash, it manifests as fatigue, muscle pain, etc. This is the \"I\" in SHINE\u2014the other residual infections. Reactivation is very real. We need to treat latent infections like candida and other fungi, and latent viruses. If someone has chronic nasal congestion, sinusitis, post-nasal drip, or irritable bowel syndrome, or intense sugar cravings, assume there's chronic candida and treat with Diflucan. If someone has chronic flu-like symptoms, I give Famciclovir (500-750 mg, 3x/d) and plus an NSAID. Celecoxib (Celebrex), it turns out, has antiviral effects. I'm targeting EBV, HSV1, any of the other herpes viruses. Give the combination for 4-6 months. It takes 2-4 months to see effects. By applying therapies that have proven effective in the aftermath of other viral infections, we can go a long way in helping our post-Covid patients recover quickly. -END- Jacob Teitelbaum, MD, is one of the most frequently quoted integrative medical authorities in the world.

The promise of the \"psychobiotic revolution\" is that many of the underlying drivers of chronic mental illness can be reversed with relatively simple interventions. \"We cannot change the genes in our cells. But we can change the genes in our microbiota. That can have a positive\u2014or a negative\u2014health benefit,\" says Ted Dinan, MD, PhD, a pioneer in the field of microbiome research. The first step is to address factors that may be impairing the optimal function of the gut- -brain-microbiome axis. Consider the following: Intestinal Permeability: The gut microbiome heavily influences gut wall permeability. We know harmful bacteria can over-colonize the colon and increase permeability, which leads to many negative consequences. The strongest example is the over-colonization of the intestine by clostridium difficile following antibiotic therapy, but there are many others. Microbiome imbalances lead to epithelial and mucosal damage, allowing potentially harmful, inflammatory molecules to enter the blood. Beneficial gut bacteria, on the other hand, decrease gut permeability by upregulating production of trans-membrane proteins that preserve the tight junctions between epithelial cells. The brain and nervous system influence intestinal permeability. For example, signals from the brain during stress can increase permeability. The CNS also influences the microbiota composition (which in turn influences intestinal permeability) directly via immune and hormonal responses. Antibiotics: These drugs are sometimes necessary, but we need to use them much more judiciously. In addition to C. difficile, many other unfriendly bugs can populate the intestines following repeated courses of antibiotics that wipe out their competition. Even with optimal care and diligent probiotic use, it can take up to three full months for the microbiome to stabilize after a course of antibiotics. Other Medications: Beyond antibiotics, many other drugs can be problematic for the microbiome. According to Dr. Dinan, 75% of commonly prescribed drugs in the US and Europe can impact the microbiota, \"and most not in a positive way.\" H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors are common culprits, but there are many. Diet: The gut microbiome is healthier when people eat a wide variety of whole foods (especially polyphenol-rich vegetables and fruits, nuts, legumes, and whole grains). It suffers when fed a steady diet of fast food, processed foods and refined carbs. Diets need to be individualized but in general it's a good idea to increase intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA as they're both important structural components in the brain. Dinan pointed out that bifidobacterial counts also rise significantly when people supplement with these omega-3s. Dietary fiber is also important, particularly inulin, which can be obtained from leeks, jicama, onions, potatoes, wheat (for those who do not have gluten sensitivities), and especially from Jerusalem artichokes (aka sunchokes). Naturally fermented foods\u2014unpasteurized sauerkraut, kimchi, and the like\u2014are also good additions to the diet. Curcumin: \"I don't believe it enters the brain in any sizeable quantities,\" says Dr. Dinan of this popular spice. \"But it has big effects on the gut microbiome, which could very well account for the anti-depressant and pro-cognitive benefits observed in a number of well- designed curcumin studies.\" Exercise: Gut microflora are healthier in people that engage in regular aerobic exercise. Psychobiotic Supplementation: Clearly, supplementation with psychobiotics will play an important role in optimizing the gut-brain relationship. Dr. Dinan says it is best to use multi-strain products containing at least nine billion colony forming units. Products containing several different organisms will help promote microbial diversity. \"In general,\" Dr. Dinan says, \"psychobiotics are tourist in our intestines. They can be exceedingly active, producing bioactive molecules, and stimulating our immune systems. But they do not colonize the intestine. They have to be taken on an ongoing basis to continue to "}
