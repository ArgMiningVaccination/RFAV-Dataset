Its findings demonstrate that we all have the ability to heal. This capacity exists within us in the form of energy which, when channeled effectively, can free us from mind-body health problems. The relationship between mind and body and the latest methods of working with healing energies are explained in this new book released by W.W. Norton in December, 2000 (Hardcover, 268 pages). To order the book from Amazon.com, [click here](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393703266/qid=980211404/104-4498322-5799101). Each of the energy methods described in the book, EMDR lateral eye movement, hypnosis, Thought Field Therapy (TFT), body-focused therapy, and a special visualization approach, is used to open the pathways that impact our energy systems. Finding the Energy to Heal is an educational resource for people who want to explore creative methods of treatment for general stresses, for health symptoms resulting from post-traumatic stress, or for stress problems connected with organic conditions. The common thread between energy methods is the focus on locating a safe, comfortable mind-body state and learning techniques that channel the energy found there towards healing. Finding the Energy to Heal guides readers through a series of vivid stories to determine their own individual needs and capacities. The author emphasizes that no one method of mind-body therapy will be successful for everyone, but rather a combination of these therapies may be applied to the individual's specific goals. For the therapist reader, she provides practical guiding principles for selecting the right therapy for a client. For people who have exhausted attempts at healing through traditional medicine, this book offers hope-filled alternatives with remedies that do not require drugs or invasive medical procedures. Featured energy therapies explore hidden struggles which can contribute to health conditions that are often unexplained or mysterious, but may be within our power to heal. Readers will discover how people can be helped to recover from desperate situations and to alleviate symptoms before they have become debilitating and possibly life-threatening. If you have a health problem related to the stresses of past trauma, situational anxieties, genetic or organic conditions, or inner conflicts related to incomplete developmental learning, this book may be especially helpful to you. Finding the Energy to Heal may help you understand how your health imbalance may have occurred and how it can be corrected according to the principles of energy psychology. What do hypnotic states, the impact of EMDR lateral eye movements, tapping on acupuncture meridian points with Thought Field Therapy, and the use of imagery and body responses have in common? First, each can be viewed as a unique method that can enhance psychological and physical well-being. Secondly, from the perspective of eastern healing, these techniques seem to open the flow of qi so that more complete mindbody transformation can take place, much as acupuncture needles, acupressure, and herbal remedies are believed to do.
