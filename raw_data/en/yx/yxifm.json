This was how they kept their body, mind and spirit healthy and fit. As the youngest in the family, I always looked to my elders as a source of admiration and for guidance. When I was in school, I was THAT child who was always ready to go - ready to run, exercise or participate in any physical activities. But I never thought that my interest in physical fitness or health would turn my life into being a YOGI. Initially, I practiced yoga for my health and fitness and looks but then I became mesmerized with the connection of our internal body and the external world. I realized how beautifully humans are created: I felt my blood flow, my breathing, my nerves and each and every body part. My parents, ever my idols, are social workers, engaging themselves in helping and improving society. Their commitment instilled in me a desire to help people. As a [Yoga Teacher](https://www.myyogateacher.com/articles/), I want to help people improve their mental and physical well-being. I want to share this beautiful feeling of self realisation of one's own body with as many people as possible. [myYogaTeacher](https://www.myyogateacher.com/) has given me this opportunity.
