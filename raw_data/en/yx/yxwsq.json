Those of you who understand the operational aspects of publishing would know that it is a borderline scary scenario. I couldn't have done differently though. When we first discussed that we'll bring this one out as a spotlight issue, the main thought was on magnifying the efforts of a group of individuals who united for an initiative called Voices of Rural India \u2014 or VoRI, as you'll find mentioned in the folio of the magazine. Several virtual handshakes and digital letters later, things were in place. This, everyone agreed, would be a nice one! And it is. These pages \u2014 of the July 2021 issue that you're holding \u2014 aren't merely carriers of words from the rural parts of India; they are gleaming recollections of memories of the people who inhabit those lands. There's no denying that COVID-19 has been a dreadful reality . People in the rural regions have suffered beyond comprehension but their tenacity makes them triumph over adversity , eventually . To assist them in regaining their way of life, the team of VoRI embarked on a not-for-profit mission to create a tangential opportunity of livelihood for the rural dwellers. They set up a storytelling platform where people from local communities can publish narratives which are unique to their respective lands. These are enchanting tales from the deepest corners of the country which will echo in the hearts of everyone who reads them.The members of VoRI run training modules to prime the local storytellers and the ones that make the cut are subsequently published on www.voicesofruralindia.com (do give them a visit). There are several ways that you can support this initiative \u2014 become a volunteer, partner with them in some meaningful capacity , or if you can't be physically present but still want to support their noble work, contribute financially . I've heard many , many beautiful stories of lands afar but there are countless more that I am yet to discover. Well, I discovered a few while putting together this month's magazine! With this special issue, I, too, have embarked on a special journey with the title that I've admired as a reader for years. Wish me luck as I join hands with others in the team to take Outlook Traveller on newer, fulfilling and exciting journeys. Ashish Jha @AJ2eetsThe enchanting tales from the deepest corners of the country will echo in the hearts of everyone who reads themThrough the Rural Lands to Your Heart july 2021 14in Wanderers, Kings, Merchants, a brand new book I'm reading on the roots (and routes) of Indian languages, author Peggy Mohan writes, \"When languages die, it is an omen, of things to come that are still beyond our range of vision. \" But if dying languages are doomed canaries in a coal mine, what about stories and storytelling? Do they speak of invisible threats too, of impending loss, when they evaporate from our lives, our imagination? Do they also foretell the death of languages, the loss of dialects? (They do.) This special issue that you hold in your hands though, is not about cautionary tales, or words brined in regret. It's about hope and joy , and celebrating stories (and storytelling) across the diverse states of India. It's about handing over the mic to the local communities, and listening to their stories, in their voice. It's about taking pride in the oral traditions of India, and hoping earnestly that we can hold on to them for a little while longer... Those of you who have followed the journey of Outlook Traveller over the years would know that long before it became fashionable to talk about hyperlocal experiences or sustainability , responsible tourism or dekho apna desh, our intrepid editors and writers sought out people and places that mattered in their own country . They did so, not only on airplanes and trains, but also on foot, and in jalopies that were barely held together by fearlessness and faith. And at least in one instance, a legendary editor traipsed across hills and dales, 'mythical' roads and rivers, for four straight days to reach a place in eastern Arunachal Pradesh that Salman Khan (and you) can now cycle up to in a fraction of that time. Such epic trips were made by the early tribe of travel writers if only to seek out the company of new friends and listen to their stories over a shared cup of chhang. In time, we inherited their legacy , their phonebooks, and sometimes, their friends in faraway places. So, when we decided to finally formalise our commitment to people- and planet-friendly travel, and launched the Outlook Responsible Tourism Initiative in 2015, we knew we would be a sturdy new branch of a fabled, native tree. Today , whether we run national level awards or outreach programmes in the states, work with the Ministry of Tourism (India) or affiliate global organisations like the UNWTO, we fall back on 20 years of insights, and plenty of chhang-aided goodwill. We celebrate and support some of the most inspired travel communities across India and South Asia. And we do so, because we always have. The voices of rural India that you hear between these pages are no canaries in a cage. They are proud emissaries of resilient communities that also host responsible travellers in unpandemicked times. They are independent, digitally empowered storytellers, who sing of worlds that they hope to protect and honour. And so do we. Soity Banerjee Project Editor, Outlook Responsible Tourism Initiativea passage through india This special issue that you hold in your hands is about hope and joy, and celebrating stories from rural India VIjay DhasmanaFrom As trAVellers, we pAn the lAndscApe for the gold of insights about any destination and the people who inhabit it. At the heart of travel \u2014 between memory , the windows into the past, and imagination that open out into the future \u2014 lie stories. India, with its diverse landscape and cultures, is a land of infinite stories with a great spectrum of people who tell them. At one end live those who are in a temporal wrap (some that are ancient yet surviving), and at the other are people who are so modern that they are leading the way of living lightly and have the smallest ecological footprint. It is this spectrum of people that makes travel what it is meant to be: understanding ourselves and our place by experiencing the other. When the Covid pandemic hit in early 2020, of the moving parts that make up the stories of rural india Indian tourism industry \u2014 the traveller and tourism enterprises \u2014 had a voice, choice, and agency . The voice to turn the crisis of the pandemic-induced lockdown into an opportunity to rethink, reset, rebuild, and advocate for relief. The choice to pivot into new digital opportunities while sheltering at home. Or to diversify , re-imagine and recast themselves with newly positioned products for a changed world of travel. Many community tourism enterprises that work with such destinations and A part of a village in the far lands of himachal people go about their regular village lifePhoTograPhs: shuTTersTockoutlook tr AVeller 17 ProFile vori communities had to fold or morph. Despite growing access to smartphones and the internet, the lack of digital skills and tailored opportunities in rural areas in India held people back. At the heart of all destinations, and particularly with community tourism enterprises, are the people from those communities who inhabit the landscape \u2014 the local guides, the homestay hosts, the taxi drivers, dhaba owners, craftspeople, natural medicine practitioners, musicians, local environmentalists who generously draw travellers into their world. Each of these community tourism enterprises crafted experiences for the travellers that were unique to their landscape. One such community tourism enterprise, Himalayan Ark, located in a remote village in Uttarakhand, comes together every summer to go birdwatching, butterfly spotting, learn yoga and run high altitude trail runs! In one such excursion, the idea of @voicesofmunsiari came about \u2014 an Instagram channel run collectively by the village folk, sharing their everyday lives with the outside world. In subsequent years, @voicesofmunsiari, driven purely by the passion of local creators, convinced us of the untapped talent and the need to create more digital storytelling opportunities. The pandemic that severed communities from any livelihood from tourism, served as the impetus to bring like-minded community organisations across India on board to co-create a not-for-profit digital platform for rural storytellers. In August 2020, Voices of Rural India was born, more ambitious in scope, through the coming together of a travel blogger, a community leader, and a digital wizard entrepreneur and driven by the desire to give rural voices their rightful place. Voices of Rural India is currently working with rural communities in Ladakh, Himachal Grassroutes Journeys and Cherish Expeditions - all glowing examples of rural tourism in India. With over 40 stories so far, the themes on the Voices of Rural India platform span everything from the age-old traditions, the aesthetics and architecture of old village houses in India, women empowerment in rural India, lost Himalayan superfoods, the challenges of conservation and development in rural India, to how Indian village life has changed over the decades. The storytellers are typically guides, homestay hosts, people involved in tourism, and youth and women from the community , and through our intensive storytelling process, we hope they can come to proudly own their heritage, traditions, culture, food, and connection with nature.In the short term, Voices of Rural India is creating a revenue stream for remote communities through digital journalism. Funding from the Digital Empowerment Foundation helps pay storytellers directly in their bank account for every story published, as is the case when these stories are republished by our media partners. In the long run, Voices of Rural India will continue to develop digital storytelling skills at the grassroots level. And for our communities themselves, it is a coming together of storytellers from diverse landscapes in the creation of a repository of their local culture, knowledge systems, and a celebration of rural life, documented in local voices. For the rest of us stuck at home, this is a chance to explore remote corners of India virtually , through the words, photos, and videos of the very people we travel to meet, in their language, if you choose to. While tele tours are becoming a popular way to teleport and travel virtually , here we invite you to a more personal delving, deeper into the intimate space of stories shared by the tellers who belong to and own those landscapes. It is also an open invitation to come to experience these inspiring, amazing villages in India in the post-covid phase of travel!

Driven by the aim of creating a niche in the world of art and craft, the central focus with Kaushalam has always been to revive the regional, folk, and traditional art of India. Having gradually declined due to the rapidly accelerating popularity of the modern interpretations / concepts of contemporary art, it is imperative to bring back the timehonoured practices and creations to their deserving pedestal. With the backdrop of causing a complete transformation to make traditional art more desirable in the business world, Kaushalam ventured on a journey of showcasing traditional art on specially designed artefacts. The resultant efforts have been appreciated by art lovers as well as by the people scouting for colourful objects. The voyage of painting utility items by hand began from a 600 square feet studio space in Jaipur. With Kaushalam, the traditions and cultures stretching centuries back are being kept alive today, and the creations are well known across the globe. With insufficient funds and lack of good artisans being the main roadblocks, Mrinalika turned challenges into opportunities by single handedly managing the operations, and onboarding skilled craftspeople who'd forsaken their skills of indigenous art in lure of money, but were stuck doing menial daily wage jobs. As of today, several artists' livelihoods have been restored thanks to the support of Kaushalam, and they are actively assisting our movement to revive the traditional arts of India. The institution has grown robustly to become a habitat for artisans from Kashmir, Ladakh, Bihar, and several parts of Rajasthan.About the teA m: With a sharp eye on quality, the team at Kaushalam works tirelessly to ensure that only the most authentic work with finest details of each of the traditional arts is shipped.

She worked as a freelance artist for almost a decade in New York, USA and has travelled to several countries, learning about their traditional art forms. Her global exposure and unique perspectives facilitated the setting up (in April 2012), and moulding, of 'Kaushalam' . Being married to an Army officer allowed her to explore vivid regions of India, and it was during her time in Ladakh that she was given an opportunity to take Ladakhi artisans to Jaipur. The influence of the beautiful heritage city of Jaipur is amply reflected in her work. Mrinalika is a social entrepreneur and intends to uplift rural women by giving them basic training in art and colouring, therefore paving way for a respectable and sustained livelihood for them, and establishing a strong workforce of women artists. In times when rural art forms are drifting into obscurity, Mrinalika's venture 'Kaushalam' strives endlessly to bring back those art forms to life. Through Kaushalam, the continued efforts to grow the legacy of the crafts have reached global landmarks. Not only are the voices of rural India being heard through the display of these traditional arts, it is also providing an opportunity to the craftspeople to sustain, with dignity, what their elders have left behind.

Over thousands of years, in this very cave, many dedicated men from Demul and other regions of the Himalaya have achieved wisdom and enlightenment through extreme penance. One wise man among them is Tenzin Lundup, also known as the 'Yogi of the Himalaya'. On April 20, 1962, in a Gongma home in the village of Pooh in Kinnaur district, a baby boy named Govind Singh was born. While pregnant, his mother Sonam Chhodon felt a divine presence and had a vivid dream \u2014 that an enlightened being is going to be born to her. So, when the baby arrived, the family visited the local Guru in the area and asked about what's in store for his future. The Guru stated that in his previous birth, Govind Singh was a devoted yogi. He predicted that even in this birth, the boy would renounce his household responsibilities and travel in search of truth and knowledge. The boy's father, Gelek Pasang (alias Gurdayal Singh), was disappointed to learn this. He wanted his son to follow in his footsteps and become a farmer and businessman. A few months after he was born, a prominent Ladakhi lama (monk), through his meditative power, realised that the child born in Pooh village, on the full moon day of April, is the reincarnation of a great yogi. He sent a search team of lamas and representatives to the village. However, his father, who did not want his only son to renounce the world and become a lama, told the Ladakhi team that no child had been born in their home! goVInd hA d three sisters and a younger brother, and his childhood was full of love and affection. As a young boy , he was compassionate, loved music and felt eager to serve others. He pursued his graduation in Chandigarh july 2021 22sPiti vori and returned to his village with an increased interest in spirituality . He would discuss the teachings of the Buddha with his grandfather, and go to Ta-Lang Temple, to Mani Dung Gyur, for circumambulation. There he would sit among the elderly to enhance his Buddhist learnings. Upon seeing his interest in Buddhism, his family worried that the prediction about his future might come true. They decided to get him engaged against his wish at the age of 25. In a traditional Kinnauri ceremony , he was married to Ringzin, the daughter of Pooh's most elite and wealthy family . Just as his wife became pregnant, he felt the need to renounce worldly affairs before he got attached to his child. Soon, he left everything far behind in search of knowledge and a Guru. He initially joined the Bir Gonpa (monastery), where along with young lamas, he started learning the Bhoti language. He continued his studies in Bylakuppe, Mysoru's Tibetan colony , while also teaching English to the local Rinpoche and lamas. After completing his education and initiation there he left for a long pilgrimage with a focus on Lord Buddha's pilgrim sites, monasteries and pious caves. he w As overjoyed to meet his sisters again in Solan after many years. He decided to repair his grandfather's ancestral home, where for 2.5 years, he immersed himself in prayers, meditation and daily practice. To fulfil his mother's wish, he spent a year in Pooh, where his dedication to prayers took her by complete surprise. Then began a long set of nomadic travels. He moved from Pooh to Rewalsar, where the holy spirit of Guru Padmasambhava - the founder of Tantrayana Buddhism (Nyingmapa Sect) still resides in Rewalsar Lake. He then accepted an invitation to move to Nako village in Kinnaur, following which he meditated for a year in the holy cave of Somang, where he was subjected to scarcity of food and firewood during the heavy winter snowfall. Govind ji underwent solitary penance many times Govind ji sets out on the path to enlightenment Govind ji then travelled via Tashigang and Nako to receive the blessings of the renowned lama Ringzin Chhetan in Maling. The lama, aware of his hard work and dedication, accepted him as a disciple. Under the lama's wing, Govind ji worked with great concentration, accumulating knowledge and incorporating it into his daily life, until he completed his spiritual studies. He even performed duties at the local temple. Following this, Govind ji underwent deep, solitary penance for four years in Maling. During this time, he did not meet even a single human being. Any important messages were conveyed through letters. He ate minimally , and with the support of the village folk, consumed only 10 litres of water in a week. For the next three years, he meditated in a room at his sister's home in Rampur Bushahr, where again no one was permitted to meet him. Finally , he spent another three years in a cave in a different village where he primarily offered special prayers to Dakini (also known as Khandro, the ever-changing chherIng norbuoutlook tr AVeller 23 sPiti vori female energy) for the welfare of all living beings and humanity . By this time, word about this great yogi had spread far and wide. People from every corner of the Himalayas started to come to seek his blessings and discourse.Locals from Nesang village invited him to the famous Naijal Cave, where Guru Padmasambhava himself had performed penance and till date many pious symbols can be found on the stones of the cave. Govind ji accepted the invitation and decided to travel about 60 kilometres over five days by foot from Pooh to Naijal cave located 15,000 feet above sea level with winter temperatures dropping as low as -35 degrees celsius. He stopped at every village along the way , encouraging people to follow Buddha's path. At Nijal cave, he performed penance for almost 1.5 years, following which, in 2014, he began walking for nearly 450 kilometres, to Dehradun. This journey on foot became a historic event as hundreds of people joined him on the way . Wherever the group took a break, the locals would arrange for their dining and lodging. Everyone shared their individual problems with Govind ji and received blessings from him.Govind ji by now has set foot in pretty much every village in upper Kinnaur and Spiti, gained followers in every Himalayan region and has been on a pilgrimage to Nepal, Bodh Gaya, Nalanda, Sarnath, Varanasi, Vaishali and Bhutan. He urges people to follow the path of truth and non-violence, and imparts knowledge on the topics of Buddha Consciousness and Space Consciousness. Even the local priests request people to implement his teachings in their everyday life. No one has seen such a yogi in this age, and I consider myself lucky to have met him at his birthplace. I had the opportunity to discuss many different subjects with him, and left the meeting feeling inspired, with a growing interest in spirituality and social work.

While cultures and traditions reside in every nook and corner here, many tribes, peppered across the state, also call it home. One such tribe is Tharu, residing in the lowlands of the Terai region, in the foothills of the Himalaya. Lovers of nature and followers of Theravada Buddhism, these tribal people of the forest are eco-friendly, survive on minimal forest produce, and are mostly engaged in farming activities or forest dwelling, and till date inhabit forested areas. People of the Tharu tribe mainly follow the teachings of Lord Buddha. The tribe is also closely linked and has a deep, longstanding respect for the environment and they worship a large number of deities residing in the forests. Each village belonging to the tribe is governed by a council and a headman. The tribe can often be seen conversing in multiple Tharu dialects \u2014 including Hindi, Awadhi and Maithili. The tribe is deeply rooted in tradition and it is evident in the construction and decoration of their houses. While the outer walls of their house are made of clay, dung, mud and grass, the designs of their verandas\u2014colourful and printed\u2014are based on traditional learning. Although the tribe follows Hinduism and its traditions, the women here have a stronger right and hold when it comes to property. The Tharu tribe believes in peaceful coexistence among all species and this is best displayed perfectly thanks to the region they inhabit \u2014 Terari \u2014 which is teeming with wildlife. Dudhwa National Park which, together with Kishanpur and Katarnighat wildlife sanctuaries, forms the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, is among the most famous wildlife destinations not only in the Terai region, but the whole of the country. It is a nine-hour journey by road from New Delhi, and Dehradun, and about 5-6 hours from Lucknow. The landscape of the northern part of U.P . is breathtaking and there great places to explore near Dudhwa National Park. You can pay a visit to the Shiva temple at Gola Gokarannath, or the famous and magnificent Menduk Mandir (Frog Temple) in the town of Oel in Lakhimpur, while there's also the impressively build Naseeruddin Memorial Hall to give you a glimpse into India's past. Into the Forested Land Tracing the Tharu tribe's steps back into the history The government of Uttar Pradesh has outlined a plan to connect Tharu villages across the districts of Balrampur, Bahraich, Lakhimpur and Pilibhit bordering Nepal with the homestay scheme of the UP Forest Department. Aimed at preserving the tribe's unique culture, but also allowing others to witness and learn from it, the scheme will allow travellers to go to the Tharu villages and live among the members of the tribe, and understand more about their way of life. Not only will it create employment opportunities for the tribe but will also help them preserve and showcase their culture to the world. All income generation under the scheme will also be given directly to the homestay owner. july 2021 26 More than five centuries ago, an enlightened monk promised to always protect the mountain village of Giu in Spiti.

Giu is famous the world over for the mystery around the ancient Mummy of Lama Kambo. Home to roughly 250 people, Giu remained cut off from the world with barely any road access until recently . I grew up in the village of Demul in Spiti and since childhood I enjoyed sitting with the village elders, listening to ancestral stories. I'm lucky to have once visited the mummy of Giu with my father \u2014 and numerous times since \u2014 and heard the extraordinary story of it from our local friends. In the 14th century, an extraordinary child was born in Giu. He was named Sangha Tenzin. After excelling in studies, he embarked on the path of Buddhism and gave up all worldly pleasures to become a lama (monk). He spent years meditating in a cave and ultimately gained enlightenment. Back in those days Giu was a happy place, but the surrounding mountains were home to demons who constantly harassed its people and put a curse on the entire village. The elders of the village urged Lama Sangha Tenzin to save them. He agreed and spent the next few years engaged in chanting sacred mantras and practicing tantric rituals. He gained the skill to take control of any kind of evil power and on a full moon night, the lama destroyed the demons. He reassured the people that whenever the need arose in the future, he would come to protect the village. He expressed a wish for three stupas to be constructed atop his cave so that people could view them collectively as a symbol of good triumphing over evil. The village residents agreed to his wish in gratitude. As hundreds of years passed, people gradually forgot about the lama and his cave. In 1975, an earthquake caused destruction in the entire Himalayan region, also destroying the lama's stupas. During the construction of a road in the region under the the monastery of Giu that is home to the ancient mummy of lama Kambo lama vori When the news was relayed to the Indian government, an investigation team was sent to Giu.

My friend Stanzin and I had to cross the Tsetaan wooden bridge to reach Marling, the oldest hamlet of the Lungnak Valley of Zanskar, for an electrification project. It was already dark, and before us lay probably the longest wooden bridge of Zanskar, precariously hanging above the gushing Tsarap River! By the time we reached the middle, it was nearly 10 pm. All we could hear were sounds of the water flowing swiftly and the wind lashing. Darkness fell all around us. The bridge had a lot of cracks, and the other side seemed too far away .

The most remote monastery and village in Zanskar now run entirely on their own solar power grid - only because the old hanging bridge made it possible to transfer materials across the roaring river. Things are changing quickly though. The old hanging wooden bridges are now being replaced by motorable ones. Only five hanging wooden bridges remain in Zanskar, all of them in the Lungnak Valley . The hanging wooden bridges might be old, shaky , and scary after dark, but they bridge, reached the village and slept for the entire day . These hanging bridges are the lifeline of Zanskar. Since there are no big willows in Ladakh, the people of Zanskar built these indigenous structures by putting together small twigs and shrubs in a dense formation. They were made in the olden times, with no modern architectural techniques, but the bridges serve the villages well. Each one can last for decades, with villages on both sides of the river contributing to the maintenance effort every few years. In 2015, in the Lungnak valley of Zanskar, the landslides and floods washed away all bridges except one. Now that wooden bridge, also above Tsarap River (which finally becomes Zanskar River), is the only lifeline that connects the grand old monastery of Phugtal with the village of Yougar on the other side. During the electrification of the monastery , I remember the tremendous effort made by the villagers and monks to get the solar panels and batteries transported across the bridge - perhaps the most risky in Zanskar due to its always make for interesting memories. They are usable throughout the harsh winter, but interestingly no one uses them. The Tsarap River freezes over in winter and people do not need bridges to commute. They simply walk on the frozen river to get from one village to another.

The CITB represents the most vulnerable and deprived areas of India, home to nearly 80% of India's total tribal population. The partnerships that help BRLF to scale up are Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) at the grassroots, the State itself, Community Based Organisations, and Public and Private sector enterprises. BRLF supports selected CSO partners by providing technical and financial support to improve the quality of their work and build their capacities. Backing BRLF is a corpus of INR 500 crore from the Government of India, of which INR 200 crore has been received as the first tranche. The interest accrued from it is being used for its funding and facilitation activities. Besides, BRLF is raising resources from Foundations, Corporates under CSR and other agencies. The basic value proposition of BRLF lies in supporting PM's initiatives for livelihood security; doubling farmers' income; taking forward Non Pesticide Management (NPM) agriculture, a form of natural farming in line with the Bharatiya Prakritik Krishi Paddhati program; Atal Bhujal Yojana; innovations in improving rural livelihoods; value chain development for Non-Timber Forest Produce (NTFP) and crops; working in the most neglected regions and with Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups; building capacities of rural professionals; providing states a window for Non-Government Organization (NGO) partnership and transparency in support to NGOs. All of BRLF's work is completely aligned with most of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Towards meeting its goals, the total funds disbursed by BRLF since inception as grants to CSOs amounts to Rs.89.77 crores. As against this investment, BRLF has mobilized Rs. 1,355.32 crores as leverage and co-finance. This represents a multiplier of 1:15, i.e., each rupee spent on BRLF's project translates to Rs.15 being mobilized and spent effectively. Through its partners, BRLF has so far managed to reach 6.54 lakh poor households in 8480 villages of 251 blocks in 86 districts of eight states in a short span of around five years. With its focus on women and adivasis, BRLF has reached out to 5.27 lakh women and 4.94 lakh Scheduled Tribe households through its implementing partners. Some key organisations that have been receiving funds and facilitation support from BRLF include PRADAN, SRIJAN, SEWA (Odisha), FES, and CINI among Through support from BRLF, 53,773 women's self-help groups (SHGs) have been formed with 5,80,190 women members. BRLF funded projects have also promoted 134 Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), which have a membership of 42,509 poor households. NPM agriculture is a flagship intervention of BRLF. So far, 121,411 farmers and 56,782 hectares of land have been brought under NPM. BRLF is encouraging investments in the better management of natural resources, as water is key in the revival of the tribal rural economy. 17,198 water harvesting structures such as check dams, canals and farm ponds have been built in the past four years benefitting 2,34,194 poor households. Through land development activities, BRLF has reached out to 50,156 poor households and covered 55,848 hectares of land. Besides funding standalone CSO projects, BRLF has forged major state level partnerships. In 2017, the Springshed Rejuvenation program was launched in four districts of West Bengal in partnership with the Commissioner, MGNREGA, Govt of West Bengal. A total of 294 springs were treated at an expenditure of Rs. 9.37 crores, generating 291,180 person-days of employment. This was from barrenness\" , an MGNREGA-based mega-watershed program) in 55 blocks of 6 districts in West Bengal in partnership with the MGNREGA Cell of the state. A total MGNREGA and convergence leverage of Rs. 1070 crores has been achieved, creating 5.28 crore person-days of employment. BRLF also entered into a partnership with the Government of Chhattisgarh to implement a mega- watershed project in 26 blocks of 12 districts, co-created and co-financed with the Axis Bank Foundation. Under the project, an estimated 1,388 Micro-watersheds are being taken up for area treatment - checking soil erosion and runoff reduction over 6.94 lakh hectares of land. Projects worth Rs. 515.62 crores have already received administrative sanction, of which schemes worth Rs. 234.54 crores have been completed, creating more than 21 lakh person-days of employment. Subsequently BRLF has forged a partnership with the Department of Horticulture and Odisha Livelihoods Mission for implementing the Agriculture Production Cluster project in 40 backward tribal blocks of Odisha, to ensure doubling of income of small and marginal farmers, especially women, by establishing 932 Producer Groups aggregated to form 30 Producer Companies (PCs) covering 101,575 households. Rs. 182.76 crores have been leveraged from the state government. BRLF has also signed an MoU with the Commissioner, MGNREGS, Govt of Jharkhand to implement a MGNREGA-based mega watershed project in 26 blocks of 6 districts of the state. The project is co-financed and co-created by Hindustan Unilever Foundation and Welthungerhilfe. BRLF expects that the leverage of government funds in these four states for programmatic expenses will be upwards of Rs.3,000 crores over the next 3 years and at least 6 lakh families will be impacted. A truly exciting feature of these state partnerships is the capacity building of thousands of frontline state functionaries in the course of implementation. A project funded by European Union is being implemented in about 279 villages of 4 blocks in 3 districts of Madhya Pradesh viz., Shivpuri, Sheopur and Guna districts in Jharkhand viz., Latehar and Palamu to transform the lives and livelihoods of the particularly vulnerable tribal groups and Dalits of Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. The project is working towards enhancing the quality of outcomes of the grassroots interventions in the areas of water and clean energy in the wake of climate change, building capacities of CSOs in resource mobilization, advocacy and policy dialogue and driving innovations. Under its Capacity Building vertical, to build young leadership, BRLF has begun grooming adivasi youth as development professionals through a one-of-a-kind, rigorous six-month Certificate Program in Rural Livelihoods (CPRL). The course is conducted in partnership with IIHMR University, Jaipur and is a much-needed intervention at bridging the capacity gap at the grassroots. 146 adivasi youth, identified by our CSO partners as people with leadership potential, have completed this intensive 6-month, field-based course successfully in the first five batches. During the course, the candidates work with CSOs and CBOs for firsthand experience. BRLF has also sponsored 16 tribal youth to study MBA in Rural Management from IIHMRU during the last three years.

The CITB represents the most vulnerable and deprived areas of India, home to nearly 80% of India's total tribal population. The partnerships that help BRLF to scale up are Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) at the grassroots, the State itself, Community Based Organisations, and Public and Private sector enterprises. BRLF supports selected CSO partners by providing technical and financial support to improve the quality of their work and build their capacities. Backing BRLF is a corpus of INR 500 crore from the Government of India, of which INR 200 crore has been received as the first tranche. The interest accrued from it is being used for its funding and facilitation activities. Besides, BRLF is raising resources from Foundations, Corporates under CSR and other agencies. The basic value proposition of BRLF lies in supporting PM's initiatives for livelihood security; doubling farmers' income; taking forward Non Pesticide Management (NPM) agriculture, a form of natural farming in line with the Bharatiya Prakritik Krishi Paddhati program; Atal Bhujal Yojana; innovations in improving rural livelihoods; value chain development for Non-Timber Forest Produce (NTFP) and crops; working in the most neglected regions and with Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups; building capacities of rural professionals; providing states a window for Non-Government Organization (NGO) partnership and transparency in support to NGOs. All of BRLF's work is completely aligned with most of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Towards meeting its goals, the total funds disbursed by BRLF since inception as grants to CSOs amounts to Rs.89.77 crores. As against this investment, BRLF has mobilized Rs. 1,355.32 crores as leverage and co-finance. This represents a multiplier of 1:15, i.e., each rupee spent on BRLF's project translates to Rs.15 being mobilized and spent effectively. Through its partners, BRLF has so far managed to reach 6.54 lakh poor households in 8480 villages of 251 blocks in 86 districts of eight states in a short span of around five years. With its focus on women and adivasis, BRLF has reached out to 5.27 lakh women and 4.94 lakh Scheduled Tribe households through its implementing partners. Some key organisations that have been receiving funds and facilitation support from BRLF include PRADAN, SRIJAN, SEWA (Odisha), FES, and CINI among Through support from BRLF, 53,773 women's self-help groups (SHGs) have been formed with 5,80,190 women members. BRLF funded projects have also promoted 134 Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), which have a membership of 42,509 poor households. NPM agriculture is a flagship intervention of BRLF. So far, 121,411 farmers and 56,782 hectares of land have been brought under NPM. BRLF is encouraging investments in the better management of natural resources, as water is key in the revival of the tribal rural economy. 17,198 water harvesting structures such as check dams, canals and farm ponds have been built in the past four years benefitting 2,34,194 poor households. Through land development activities, BRLF has reached out to 50,156 poor households and covered 55,848 hectares of land. Besides funding standalone CSO projects, BRLF has forged major state level partnerships. In 2017, the Springshed Rejuvenation program was launched in four districts of West Bengal in partnership with the Commissioner, MGNREGA, Govt of West Bengal. A total of 294 springs were treated at an expenditure of Rs. 9.37 crores, generating 291,180 person-days of employment. This was from barrenness\" , an MGNREGA-based mega-watershed program) in 55 blocks of 6 districts in West Bengal in partnership with the MGNREGA Cell of the state. A total MGNREGA and convergence leverage of Rs. 1070 crores has been achieved, creating 5.28 crore person-days of employment. BRLF also entered into a partnership with the Government of Chhattisgarh to implement a mega- watershed project in 26 blocks of 12 districts, co-created and co-financed with the Axis Bank Foundation. Under the project, an estimated 1,388 Micro-watersheds are being taken up for area treatment - checking soil erosion and runoff reduction over 6.94 lakh hectares of land. Projects worth Rs. 515.62 crores have already received administrative sanction, of which schemes worth Rs. 234.54 crores have been completed, creating more than 21 lakh person-days of employment. Subsequently BRLF has forged a partnership with the Department of Horticulture and Odisha Livelihoods Mission for implementing the Agriculture Production Cluster project in 40 backward tribal blocks of Odisha, to ensure doubling of income of small and marginal farmers, especially women, by establishing 932 Producer Groups aggregated to form 30 Producer Companies (PCs) covering 101,575 households. Rs. 182.76 crores have been leveraged from the state government. BRLF has also signed an MoU with the Commissioner, MGNREGS, Govt of Jharkhand to implement a MGNREGA-based mega watershed project in 26 blocks of 6 districts of the state. The project is co-financed and co-created by Hindustan Unilever Foundation and Welthungerhilfe. BRLF expects that the leverage of government funds in these four states for programmatic expenses will be upwards of Rs.3,000 crores over the next 3 years and at least 6 lakh families will be impacted. A truly exciting feature of these state partnerships is the capacity building of thousands of frontline state functionaries in the course of implementation. A project funded by European Union is being implemented in about 279 villages of 4 blocks in 3 districts of Madhya Pradesh viz., Shivpuri, Sheopur and Guna districts in Jharkhand viz., Latehar and Palamu to transform the lives and livelihoods of the particularly vulnerable tribal groups and Dalits of Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. The project is working towards enhancing the quality of outcomes of the grassroots interventions in the areas of water and clean energy in the wake of climate change, building capacities of CSOs in resource mobilization, advocacy and policy dialogue and driving innovations. Under its Capacity Building vertical, to build young leadership, BRLF has begun grooming adivasi youth as development professionals through a one-of-a-kind, rigorous six-month Certificate Program in Rural Livelihoods (CPRL). The course is conducted in partnership with IIHMR University, Jaipur and is a much-needed intervention at bridging the capacity gap at the grassroots. 146 adivasi youth, identified by our CSO partners as people with leadership potential, have completed this intensive 6-month, field-based course successfully in the first five batches. During the course, the candidates work with CSOs and CBOs for firsthand experience. BRLF has also sponsored 16 tribal youth to study MBA in Rural Management from IIHMRU during the last three years.

During my schooling I learnt about the cultural diversity of Changthang, which is also home to a nomadic tribe called the Changpas, who rear the famous Changthangi goats or the pashmina goats. Sometime in 2003, I was selected for a crash course by the Ministry of Textile, in collaboration with Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council. During the 15-day training we learnt about textile machinery and the super-fine cashmere. I soon realised that majorly raw pashmina was being exported but I believed we could also make handmade products. In 2010, I left my job as a technician. My mother is from a nomadic family and to honour my heritage, I started my own venture \u2014 Nomadic Woollen Mills. My sole aim was to utilise all my learnings to create an ecosystem that offers employment to local artisans, besides creating beautiful pashmina products. I began by training local women in pashmina spinning, knitting and weaving, organising designing and sizing so that we could make products for commercial purposes. I started with a small shop and when business grew in 2016, I opened a new, bigger one. A few years ago, I had promised to donate wool-shearing machines to the nomadic sheep-rearing families in the remote Samad Rockchan region. However, upon reaching there, I realised they had no access to electricity . I wanted to keep up my promise by giving them something useful and ended up donating solar lanterns to 69 families the next time. I think it's time we find ways to develop a robust universe where nomads, weavers, craftsmen and locals flourish financially and creatively - and the rest of us remember our nomadic roots.

The way authors build a world through their writing and manage to capture a reader's imagination never fails to amaze me. I believe that reading stays in our minds far longer than what we see. When I was a child, I would read all kinds of stories to my father, who loved listening to them. He did not get much of an education and therefore, couldn't read. I took it upon myself to read entire books to him and give him updates about events around the world by reading the news. I would write letters to our relatives and friends on my father's behalf, and then read them out loud so that he could check what I had written. That was perhaps how my love for reading began, and it grew with age. It was the same love that made me choose the job of a 'walking librarian' at Pratibha Public Library \u2014 an offshoot of Library Movement in Kerala. The library was built in 1961 in my village Mothakkara, in the Mananthavady taluk of Kerala's Wayanad district. This region is home to beautiful rivers, small waterfalls, farms and a wide diversity of birds and plants, and is surrounded by lush green mountains. Although the library has been around for almost 60 years, people in the village \u2014 women in particular \u2014 had no easy access to books until a few years ago. Despite their love for reading, their tight schedules, busy farming lives, and the distance and time to commute to the library made it difficult for them to visit regularly to borrow books. since 2012, when I st Arted work Ing at Pratibha Library , I have been delivering books to the homes of the library members six days a week. I give them two new books each time, collect them after eight days, and keep a record in the library register. I work based on the guidelines that the library council provides for book distribution and delivery . By now, I have become familiar with the tastes of various members through continuous interaction. Every week, I look at the library's collection of books and try to find titles that would appeal to the members' tastes. The library has treasure trove of books july 2021 40kerala vori over 11,000 books in the Malayalam, English and Hindi languages, and we currently have 102 members, including some senior citizens. I carry around 25 to 30 books every day \u2014 a mix of different genres \u2014 in a cloth shopping bag, so that members can select books of their choice. The cool weather in Wayanad makes it conducive for walking. The ardent readers of my community now spend more time with books once they reach home from work. People who work outdoors, in the fields, also take books from me while I'm on my way to their houses. Now that people are no longer forced to restrict their reading to weekly magazines, they've started reading different genres regularly . My ability to create opportunities for them to read and bring smiles to their faces as they welcome books arriving at their home gives me great pleasure. All these years, I have been delivering 500-550 books on an average per month. That changed with the pandemic in 2020, and the subsequent lockdown led to minimising its spread. I can no longer access all areas, as some have been declared containment zones. I am now able to deliver only 300-350 books in a month. Yet, it's been heartening to see the positive effect that reading has had on some people amidst the chaos that the pandemic has brought along. Most members who were feeling stuck at home and low during the lockdown find peace through reading the books that I deliver to their homes. During thIs phA se, I also started providing books to all the indigenous tribal children. It is a delight to see their excited faces when they see me with new books. Some children call me over the phone to confirm my next walk towards their houses. Over time, I have developed strong bonds with all the reading members. Some give me wonderful reviews on books that they find interesting and urge me to read them. I note down the titles of those books and make sure that I take them home next time. In a way , these members create opportunities for me to nurture my passion for reading. On a member's recommendation, I recently read a book titled ' Aadujeevitham' by Benyamin. It impacted me deeply , and Najeeb \u2014 one of the characters in the book \u2014 will live forever in my mind, giving me strength and motivating me not to give up but fight in adverse situations. I love everything about my job. It gives me an opportunity to expand my worldview by having interesting conversations and discussions about books every day . I love sharing books and daily life with people. My job has taught me the most important lesson of life \u2014 what you give is what you reap. I treat all the library members with affection and care, and I earn respect from all in return. my exper Ience A s A librarian also helped me as a tourist guide, an additional role I took up in 2014. When I realised that I needed to learn more about a field that was completely new i was recommended a book titled Aadujeevitham and reading it inspired me to fight any adversity and never give up brIan raPsey, PosITIVe FooTPrInTs- WorlD nomaDs the hilly terrain of wayanad is wonderfully green and rich Trav El PromoT ion Clockwise from here: the magnificent sword-shaped falls of k handadhar; the 's ilent Valley' of m andasaru; and h irakud, the world's longest earthen dam surprise that this quaint little hill station is also tagged as the 'Kashmir of Odisha'.

Another inspiring story under the hat is that of Fulmoni, who lost her father at the age of four, and left behind her mother to shoulder the responsibility of their seven children. Due to lack of education none of them could attain a well-paying job and had a tough time making ends meet. It was in 2015 that Fulmoni joined Literacy India's non-profit vocational training program in tailoring and since then there has been no looking back. Within a short span she learnt the craft and how to stitch various patterns. Her journey with Literacy India has not only helped her accomplish a new skill set, but also motivated her to bring her family out of their financial troubles. The resilient Fulmoni now aspires to become a successful artisan, work her way up through the financial troubles and uplift her family.

Losar, the Ladakhi New Year, is also a festival associated with the stars. My village, Maan, on the shores of Pangong Lake in Ladakh, is a special place for stargazing, free of clouds, light or air pollution. Growing up I learned that women in our village take care of household chores, work on the farm, raise children and weave handicrafts. Men usually go to Leh and other towns to work as guides or travel agents. So as a woman, I had two options \u2014 to get married or engage in labour intensive work. I wanted to be independent but there was no visible path. Keen to have a better life, I continued to study , hoping to find my own journey . They say fortune favours the brave and the stars aligned for me one eventful day , when I was selected among several other women, for an astronomy training session by the scientists of the International Astronomical Union. After all these years of hearing stories of the stars I was excited to be trained in the basics of astronomy , the technicalities of operating a telescope and interacting with travellers. I was thrilled to hear that the first telescope of the project would be installed in my village. Since then, our group of five women have been conducting stargazing sessions every night on the shores of Pangong Lake. On a regular night in Ladakh, we can see constellations like the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia, and the Pole Star. Sometimes we can also spot the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, zoom into the craters of Earth's moon and identify numerous other stars and constellations. During the sessions, we like to share stories about the stars that we heard growing up. We try to learn continuously and keep our knowledge up to date. Our supporting partners share documents, websites and practical applications for us to expand our knowledge of the night sky . We now also have a network of homestays called Astrostays through which we have found employment \u2014 a steady source of income and a path towards independence. Today when I look at young girls in my village, I realise how things have changed for the better. Girls have now started attending school regularly . Whether in astronomy or other fields, I hope that one day , the stars will align for them too.

In its milky brightness, some of the biggest challenges of our daily lives back home suddenly seemed surmountable. What if we, too, had bulbs in our village? What if we could defy the darkness, and stretch the day , long after the sun had slid behind the coppery mountains of the Markha Valley? Growing up our lives were deeply interwoven with nature. We lived in harmony with wild animals in the Ladakhi countryside, and our days revolved around the sun, getting shorter during winters. A typical day started early with household chores, followed by school and farming. We rushed from school to help our parents on the farm, then home to complete our homework and even cook before sundown. None of us were allowed to step out after dark, of course, as it was the turn of the animals to roam free and stake their claim to the valley . For mountain communities, education comes at a price. We don't have even the basic infrastructure and facilities like electricity , water, and a sturdy roof. In a remote village like ours, it's a luxury to find a school with permanent teachers, forget about computers, internet or high-tech classes. So, after completing my primary education in the village, I had to move to Leh to study further. I was always interested in science, which has stood me in good stead over the years, eventually supporting my quest to help the community . At the time, however, I had no intentions of enrolling for higher studies, even though I wanted an independent life. I couldn't get the jobs I wanted, and a couple of years later, I got married. But the idea of being independent never left me and my plans materialised after my second child was born. it wAs An unexpected turn of events that led me to Global Himalayan Expedition (GHE), and to a career in clean energy access. My brother, who was a part of the organisation already , told me about the opportunity to train as a solar engineer. The first hurdle though, was to attend a six-month-long training programme in Rajasthan. I was nervous about leaving my family behind and travelling to a new place with unfamiliar language and food. But my husband encouraged me to take the plunge. Eventually , the fear of uncertainty gave way to dreams and I got going. I was at the Barefoot College in Tilonia and the first month was tough thanks to the soaring temperatures and spicy food. It was here that I held a screwdriver in my hand for the very first time, and soon learnt how to repair LED bulbs, charge controllers and solar lanterns. Later, I also picked up more information on solar panels and batteries. Apart from the technical knowhow, we also learnt the basics of finance, weaving techniques and soft skills at Barefoot that I've put to good use ever since. I joined GHE after I returned to Leh from Rajasthan, and soon after, I headed out for my very first assignment with my colleague, Achen, to electrify the sacred Lingshed monastery in Leh District, which is nearly 1,000 years old, and 97 households in its adjacent village. The Head Lama told us that he was pleased to see Ladakhi women setting an example for others to follow. It feels great when women of my own community consider me a role model. It makes me aware of my responsibilities. Next was GHE's first project beyond the borders of Ladakh. It was also the first time I was travelling alone to a place as far away as Meghalaya.

Supported by - Global Himalayan Expedition (GHE) ashWInI chauDhary www.voicesofruralindia.orgCraft in i ndia Craftsmen are the backbone of India's rural economy. Historically, crafts have held a special patronage in India. However, rapid industrialisation has slowly led to people pursuing alternative job opportunities to enhance their economic conditions. Indian craftsmen face many challenges in the face of modernization. A majority of craftsmen continue to operate in informal settings, have poor exposure to market intelligence, lack education and struggle to operate in the fragmented value chain. In the face of such adversity, Leela Bordia emerged as a pioneer and mentor leading many village craftsmen towards entrepreneurial transformation. Her continual efforts not only resuscitated the craft of Blue Pottery in Rajasthan but also altered the fortunes of hundreds of villagers. She single-handedly brought prosperity and a sense of pride in craft to the craftsmen. Passion for Change Inspired by her mother's work with Mother Teresa in Calcutta, Mrs. Bordia set out in search of an opportunity that would help her make a change in society by helping those in need. In 1976, she visited a settlement of craftsmen in Jaipur and was shocked to see their poor living conditions. She found a few workers huddled in a room working on traditional blue pottery and was amazed to discover that their work was intricate, eye-catching and rich. Most of these craftsmen belonged to the villages around Jaipur and had migrated to the city in search of employment, ending up living in squalor and isolation from their families and community. Mrs. Bordia decided that this was the opportunity she had been looking for and decided that she would make the craft of blue pottery a medium of bettering lives and creating a sustainable livelihood for its craftsmen. Not wanting to simply dole out money, she saw an opportunity here to give the artisans themselves the power to earn their own livelihood. Creating Craft e ntreP reneurs Mrs. Bordia said: \"I pursued my passi on for blue pottery and simultaneously searched for avenues to benefit not only this exquisite craft but also the craftsmen. It was not me that chose this craft but the craft itself that chose me to be its voice\" . This journey began with one craftsman and one product and from there more and more craftsmen began to discover the true value of their work and started to join hands with her. The first change that Mrs. Bordia made was to set up production units in the villages. In the beginning this was a difficult task as the craftsmen did not believe that working from their villages could provide them with a substantial enough income. However, with time they began to realise the benefits of her vision. By going back to the villages, they were able to not only make pottery but also farm their land and teach their skill to their families and communities so as to become self-reliant craft entrepreneurs. Aside from helping avoid needless nomadic labour in the cities and displacement of people, self-reliant units also helped preserve the traditions and culture of the villages and contribute to the overall development of the area. Today, these villages have an effective infrastructure with schools, hospitals and basic amenities, all developed through the efforts of the craftsmen that live and work there. innovation in the Craft: u tility from a rt Neerja International was born out of necessity. A means to an end, the company was created to provide a platform for the craftsmen of blue pottery to be able to showcase and sell their work. Very early on, Mrs. Bordia realised that the traditional products created from blue pottery were beautiful art objects with no real-life applications. \"If art is only used for beautification, and no utility is derived from it, fewer pieces will be made. How will the craft survive?\" says Mrs. Bordia. Often criticised for the change in colours that she brought about, she did not lose heart and only thought about what would benefit the craft and its people. She encouraged the craftsmen to innovate with blue pottery to create everyday utility products. Despite their initial hesitation, the craftsmen learnt to innovate and work beyond the limitations of traditional blue pottery items like vases and bowls, to bring about a twist to appeal to the modern masses. Once they were made to realise the value of blue pottery in the modern market, they began creating utility objects like beads, pen holders, door knobs, tiles, to name a few. The growth of Neerja International is synonymous with the growth of the craftsmen it engages. Presently, the company produces over 500 different items, each with hundreds of different design variations using traditional and adapted blue pottery techniques. Wfh and the Covid19 PandemiC - Work from home is nothing ne W for n eerja Today the company under able guidance of Mrs. Bordia and her family, continues to work with over 1000 craftsmen and affiliated artists either directly or indirectly. Neerja International works with specially-abled persons who are gainfully employed with the organisation after being trained in the craft of blue pottery and also provides a source of financial independence to women. One example of this is the women of the 'Patwa' community in Rajasthan. All the weaving and threadwork for the jewellery collections made at Neerja at done by the women from this traditional community who have been trained in this skill and can now be gainfully employed and earn a living from within their homes and family units. Artisans working with Mrs. Bordia's company work in their home villages which helps avoid displacement of labour. Their work is contractual. They deliver the finished products to the central office in Jaipur upon completion. An example of the power of self-reliance that Mrs. Bordia has imbibed in her team is the way that the craftsmen of blue pottery and the company itself have dealt with the Covid19 pandemic in the last two years. During a global phenomenon like Corona, where industries were forced to come to a standstill, Neerja International only shut its doors for the first mandatory lockdown in India in 2020. Post which, the company which has been a pioneer of what is today being recognized the world over as the New Norm of Work-From-Home continued to keep its craftsmen busy and engaged. Saving livelihoods and continuing essential activities like research and development on important aspects of blue pottery like the strengthening of the ceramic, the company continued to support the artists working with them by ensuring that orders kept coming in and new innovations were made during this period. On an average, at least one new product per day was being designed by the company during this period. This helped keep everyone busy and their spirits up. Idle hands and idle minds can lead to anxiety and depression. At Neerja, this was avoided so that every craftsman and every member of the Neerja family stayed employed, productive and positive.Another great advantage of self-reliant units is that handmade crafts like blue pottery are labour intensive and time consuming. Therefore, working in a self-reliant unit gives the craftsmen the freedom to decide how much work they wish to undertake and allows them the ability to be in control of the income they can generate. Also, more and more young people are encouraged to pursue the craft when employment becomes available in their home towns and villages. aW ards and aCColades Mrs. Leela Bordia is the first Indian lady ceramist to write a book on blue pottery titled - A Tribute to Blue Pottery. She presented the first copy of this work to Late Shree Pranab Mukherjee (then President of India) Her work has been an inspiration for many and she features as a case study in the publication 'Business in Asia' and in author Rashmi Bansal's book, 'Follow Every Rainbow' , a popular read. NCERT has also incorporated a chapter about her work in their syllabus on Entreprenuership. Her wall is decorated with the awards she has received but what gives her the most satisfaction is overcoming the challenges that blue pottery throws in her way, like making the biggest blue pottery plate in the world, a re cord registered in Limca Book of Records. Keeping the craft of blue pottery alive is her dream today as much as it was in 1976. It is her ardent wish that more and more people talk about blue pottery and what makes her happiest is when people refer to this craft as Jaipur Blue Pottery. That to her is the very best accolade.

However, rapid industrialisation has slowly led to people pursuing alternative job opportunities to enhance their economic conditions. Indian craftsmen face many challenges in the face of modernization. A majority of craftsmen continue to operate in informal settings, have poor exposure to market intelligence, lack education and struggle to operate in the fragmented value chain. In the face of such adversity, Leela Bordia emerged as a pioneer and mentor leading many village craftsmen towards entrepreneurial transformation. Her continual efforts not only resuscitated the craft of Blue Pottery in Rajasthan but also altered the fortunes of hundreds of villagers. She single-handedly brought prosperity and a sense of pride in craft to the craftsmen. Passion for Change Inspired by her mother's work with Mother Teresa in Calcutta, Mrs. Bordia set out in search of an opportunity that would help her make a change in society by helping those in need. In 1976, she visited a settlement of craftsmen in Jaipur and was shocked to see their poor living conditions. She found a few workers huddled in a room working on traditional blue pottery and was amazed to discover that their work was intricate, eye-catching and rich. Most of these craftsmen belonged to the villages around Jaipur and had migrated to the city in search of employment, ending up living in squalor and isolation from their families and community. Mrs. Bordia decided that this was the opportunity she had been looking for and decided that she would make the craft of blue pottery a medium of bettering lives and creating a sustainable livelihood for its craftsmen. Not wanting to simply dole out money, she saw an opportunity here to give the artisans themselves the power to earn their own livelihood. Creating Craft e ntreP reneurs Mrs. Bordia said: \"I pursued my passi on for blue pottery and simultaneously searched for avenues to benefit not only this exquisite craft but also the craftsmen. It was not me that chose this craft but the craft itself that chose me to be its voice\" . This journey began with one craftsman and one product and from there more and more craftsmen began to discover the true value of their work and started to join hands with her. The first change that Mrs. Bordia made was to set up production units in the villages. In the beginning this was a difficult task as the craftsmen did not believe that working from their villages could provide them with a substantial enough income. However, with time they began to realise the benefits of her vision. By going back to the villages, they were able to not only make pottery but also farm their land and teach their skill to their families and communities so as to become self-reliant craft entrepreneurs. Aside from helping avoid needless nomadic labour in the cities and displacement of people, self-reliant units also helped preserve the traditions and culture of the villages and contribute to the overall development of the area. Today, these villages have an effective infrastructure with schools, hospitals and basic amenities, all developed through the efforts of the craftsmen that live and work there. innovation in the Craft: u tility from a rt Neerja International was born out of necessity. A means to an end, the company was created to provide a platform for the craftsmen of blue pottery to be able to showcase and sell their work. Very early on, Mrs. Bordia realised that the traditional products created from blue pottery were beautiful art objects with no real-life applications. \"If art is only used for beautification, and no utility is derived from it, fewer pieces will be made. How will the craft survive?\" says Mrs. Bordia. Often criticised for the change in colours that she brought about, she did not lose heart and only thought about what would benefit the craft and its people. She encouraged the craftsmen to innovate with blue pottery to create everyday utility products. Despite their initial hesitation, the craftsmen learnt to innovate and work beyond the limitations of traditional blue pottery items like vases and bowls, to bring about a twist to appeal to the modern masses. Once they were made to realise the value of blue pottery in the modern market, they began creating utility objects like beads, pen holders, door knobs, tiles, to name a few. The growth of Neerja International is synonymous with the growth of the craftsmen it engages. Presently, the company produces over 500 different items, each with hundreds of different design variations using traditional and adapted blue pottery techniques. Wfh and the Covid19 PandemiC - Work from home is nothing ne W for n eerja Today the company under able guidance of Mrs. Bordia and her family, continues to work with over 1000 craftsmen and affiliated artists either directly or indirectly. Neerja International works with specially-abled persons who are gainfully employed with the organisation after being trained in the craft of blue pottery and also provides a source of financial independence to women. One example of this is the women of the 'Patwa' community in Rajasthan. All the weaving and threadwork for the jewellery collections made at Neerja at done by the women from this traditional community who have been trained in this skill and can now be gainfully employed and earn a living from within their homes and family units. Artisans working with Mrs. Bordia's company work in their home villages which helps avoid displacement of labour. Their work is contractual. They deliver the finished products to the central office in Jaipur upon completion. An example of the power of self-reliance that Mrs. Bordia has imbibed in her team is the way that the craftsmen of blue pottery and the company itself have dealt with the Covid19 pandemic in the last two years. During a global phenomenon like Corona, where industries were forced to come to a standstill, Neerja International only shut its doors for the first mandatory lockdown in India in 2020. Post which, the company which has been a pioneer of what is today being recognized the world over as the New Norm of Work-From-Home continued to keep its craftsmen busy and engaged. Saving livelihoods and continuing essential activities like research and development on important aspects of blue pottery like the strengthening of the ceramic, the company continued to support the artists working with them by ensuring that orders kept coming in and new innovations were made during this period. On an average, at least one new product per day was being designed by the company during this period. This helped keep everyone busy and their spirits up. Idle hands and idle minds can lead to anxiety and depression. At Neerja, this was avoided so that every craftsman and every member of the Neerja family stayed employed, productive and positive.Another great advantage of self-reliant units is that handmade crafts like blue pottery are labour intensive and time consuming. Therefore, working in a self-reliant unit gives the craftsmen the freedom to decide how much work they wish to undertake and allows them the ability to be in control of the income they can generate. Also, more and more young people are encouraged to pursue the craft when employment becomes available in their home towns and villages. aW ards and aCColades Mrs. Leela Bordia is the first Indian lady ceramist to write a book on blue pottery titled - A Tribute to Blue Pottery. She presented the first copy of this work to Late Shree Pranab Mukherjee (then President of India) Her work has been an inspiration for many and she features as a case study in the publication 'Business in Asia' and in author Rashmi Bansal's book, 'Follow Every Rainbow' , a popular read. NCERT has also incorporated a chapter about her work in their syllabus on Entreprenuership. Her wall is decorated with the awards she has received but what gives her the most satisfaction is overcoming the challenges that blue pottery throws in her way, like making the biggest blue pottery plate in the world, a re cord registered in Limca Book of Records. Keeping the craft of blue pottery alive is her dream today as much as it was in 1976. It is her ardent wish that more and more people talk about blue pottery and what makes her happiest is when people refer to this craft as Jaipur Blue Pottery. That to her is the very best accolade.

I worked as a high-altitude trekking and birding guide, so the income I earned to run my house also suddenly dried up. We have been engaged with tourism and homestays in our village for the past 16 years. For the past year and a half, we have been retrofitting these homestays with wood carvings through Shilp Studio, a collaborative project between Himal Prakriti and IIT Rourkee. The doors and windows in our village are made in the traditional style, with wood carvings on them. I always wondered about their creation. It was only recently that I got the chance to learn about Hindi likhai \u2014 the craft of wood carving. Wood from the akhrot (walnut) tree is preferred for carving as it is dense and has a fine grain that suitable for minute designs.

T to reA ch the smA ll VIllA ge of Chiringmagre in Meghalaya's South Garo Hills where I live, one has to endure slow and gruelling progress on foot for six hours crossing a river and a jungle. The path skirts around the densest area of the woods \u2014 a section that is sacred to us. The sacred forest is called A'song Kosi. This is a special place. Outsiders are forbidden from entering the sacred forest and no one, not even a member of our tribe, can cause any harm to the trees, flowers, or animals here. It has been this way for as long as I can remember, and my forefathers before that. Like any ancient tradition, this, too, has a story behind it. The ancient indigenous Garo people had faith in one supreme spirit \u2014 one who is the creator of all the universe and the preserver of all living beings. It is believed that man is unworthy of calling him by his name, so he is known by his manifestations and work. He's called Kalkame. The Garo people offer a sacrifice to him once a year, thanking him for his work and praying for his continued protection. According to traditions, the place where the sacrifice is offered is the sacred forest. It is strongly believed that if anyone causes harm to any living being here, they will get sick, so nobody harms that part of the jungle in any way . Chiringmagre's sacred forest was established in the 17th century when Shri Wanding Ch. Marak, his wife Mejing M. Sangma, and the villagers who bought our village land offered the first sacrifice here. It is situated about 10 kilometres from Chokpot Block in south Garo Hills district, west of Rongmegre village, and covers an area of ninety seven bighas. The practice of offering sacrifices continued till 1989, when it was stopped as most members of our tribe converted to Christianity . Though we no longer offer sacrifices to Kalkame, we have continued to preserve the forest as a village tradition. A variety of birds, animals, insects, and over a thousand varieties of trees (even those with medicinal properties) and plants bearing wild fruits are found in the sacred forest. One sentiment that all tribes have in common is the respect for nature. In our tribe, the elders make decisions for the community and we all abide by them. The forest is our inherited wealth, and everyone in the village must follow the rules made for its protection or face penalties. Lastly , I also try to conduct programs to inform the people of my village about global warming, the impact of cutting trees, and the need to preserve our biodiversity . Our tribe has created a village group, which I preside over, to maintain and protect this reserve. We want to look after the forest so it can be a home for a variety of animals, birds and plants. The forest is also our water catchment area that helps us ensure that we will have resources for the future. This way we can also preserve the stone monuments that were erected here by our forefathers. Our tribes live in the forest and understand the value of using its resources wisely as our survival depends on it. I believe that ancient traditions can play a huge role in designing modern sustainability practices. From them, we can learn to live in harmony with nature. T abouT The sToryTeller witerSon M.

After completing the work at our farm, my wife and I headed to the forest adjoining our village \u2014 B aradpani \u2014 to forage for wild vegetables. Midway we saw a King Cobra blocking our path. It was staring at us and didn't want us going any further. Snake sightings are not unusual in our village. Our ancestors have worshipped nature and its creations for a long time, including the Naag Devta (the Snake God). Neither were we startled nor wanted to hurt the cobra. We tried to shoo it away , but it didn't budge. Generally it's enough to make a snake slither away , so we wondered why it wasn't moving out of our way . We, the Dang people, believe that snakes can sense danger, and maybe it lurked ahead, we wondered. But getting vegetables from the forest was essential, so we bowed to the cobra and took a different path towards the forest. In the woods, walking in search of the vegetables, we were oblivious to the likelihood of any danger. Suddenly , the unmistakable roar of a leopard tensed up the air. We didn't see it, but it must have seen us, or heard our voices, and probably roared to protect itself. Fearing that it might attack us, my wife and I ran back to a safer place. That's when we realized that Naag Devta - the cobra - had tried to stop us from going into the forest that day . It was perhaps warning us of the danger ahead, which we chose to ignore. i grew up In the hilly forest terrain of Baradpani village in the Dang district in the southern part of Gujarat. Here we consider the Surya Dev (Sun God), Chandra Dev (Moon God), Naag Devta (Snake God), Bagh Devta (Tiger God) and other natural creations sacred. The importance of Naag Devta is unparalleled and the well-known hill station, Saputara, just a few kilometres flying snake found in the Dang region of Gujarat july 2021 58GuJ arat vori away from my village, has been named after the snake deity . Winter temperatures here drop to 3-5 degrees celsius, leading to chilly , misty mornings. During monsoons the whole place comes alive in different shades of green. Rice, wheat, millet, lentils, soybeans, etc. are cultivated here. Saputara makes us forget all our troubles and we only savour the beauty of this place. As a child, I heard from our elders that there was a small village named Thaana in this region which was part of the state of Maharashtra. The river Sarp Ganga flowed through the village. One day some King Cobras slithered along the banks of the river and one of them stopped over a stone. It is believed that an impression of the snake was created on that stone and the village thereafter became known as Saap Utaara (which means impression of a snake). Time went on, and the name Saap Utaara got distorted to Saputara.catches the reptile and releases it in the jungle. However, the fear of snakes has been growing in Saputara. When a snake accidentally enters a house, sometimes it is killed mercilessly . the dAng communIty has traditionally worshipped snakes and therefore never hurt them. Unfortunately , these days snakes aren't valued as much as before. Neither the listeners nor the storytellers are interested. Due to this lack The stone where the snake left an impression is our shrine. On the day of Naag Panchami, one of the oldest festivals in our community , the Dang people make small idols of snakes using the soil in their fields. In Saputara and other parts of Dang, snakes are worshipped because they are regarded as the embodiment of the deity Shiva. This is an ancient tribal ritual that dates back centuries. There are many varieties of snakes still found in-and-around Saputara, including rat snakes, pit vipers and cobras.

My earliest childhood memories are those of sitting by the lakeside near my home and dropping the net in it to catch different varieties of fish. It was the time when the lake was home to over 150 species of fish. Even as a child, I was aware of the challenges that the fishermen in my community faced to make ends meet. Over the years, as the fish population in the lake declined, the problems of the fishermen inflated multifold. There are many factors that contributed to the impoverishment of the Vembanad Lake ecosystem. One of the major factors was the construction of Thanneermukkom salt water barrier in 1975 across the Vembanad Lake. It prevented the flow of salt water from the tidal waves of the Arabian Sea into the lowlands of the Kuttanad region. This was done to help paddy cultivation that needs fresh water. This barrier divided the 36,000 hectares lake into two parts, the north and the south. Before the barrier was commissioned, 429 tonnes of prawns were obtained from the lake as per the government records. A year after its completion, the number declined by 27 tonnes. Studies revealed that this decline was a result of reduced salinity in water in the southern part of the lake. Prawns need salty water for breeding; clams, too. A clam lays about 5 lakhs eggs, which the salty water facilitates the hatching of. The population of crabs and shrimp that used to come from the sea into the lake water also declined. Half of the 150 species of crabs have been wiped out since the barrage was built and it has resulted in community and government losses amounting to hundreds of crores. the green r eVolutIon that commenced in 1965 in India was another factor that adversely impacted the marine life of Vembanad Lake. Excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers to protect grain crops and increase crop production polluted the water of the lake and resulted in the disappearance of fish species. Moreover, the consumption of fish from the pesticide- laden water caused health hazards. The growth of the industrial sector caused industrial waste to trickle into the lake. Also, increased tourism brought more boats than the lake could carry . All these factors contributed heavily to polluting the lake water, shrinking its size, decimating fish stock and eventually impacting the livelihoods of the local fishermen. With survival becoming difficult, the fishermen replaced the old eco-friendly nets with nylon nets with the smallest mesh size to catch more fish, including juvenile ones. Earlier, they caught large clams, but due to the lack of availability , small clams were half of the 150 species of crabs have been wiped out since the barrage was built and it has resulted in community and government losses amounting to hundreds of crores A fresh catch of clams Anchovies from the lake shuTTersTock shuTTersTock movement to exalt the way of life of the people who are behind the creations.

If you catch a clam when it is 6 months old, it does not have reproductive capacity . So, reproduction of clams stopped and clam catches fell. Not a single spot of the lake was left untouched. To address these ever-increasing problems, the Vembanad Nature Club was established in 1986 in Muhamma village. In 2007, Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment (ATREE) started working together with the local fishing communities and institutions to address the conservation issues the lake faced. I joined Vembanad Kayal Samrakshana Samiti, or the Lake Protection Forum (LPF), at a young age. LPFs use traditional ecological knowledge to govern and manage fishery resources. They study the challenges of the fishing community , come up with localised solutions, find people who are interested in supporting the initiatives, and work with them to bring about real change. I started participating in LPF initiatives and organised many awareness programs for fishermen, general public and government officials. To prevent the problems associated with overfishing, we started building fish sanctuaries by using bamboo fencing and branches of cashew and mango trees. These sanctuaries were declared no-fishing zones to help fish breed and LPF members took turns to keep vigil. Today , through the continuous and combined efforts of organisations such as ATREE and Cherish Expeditions, local bodies such as Lake Protection Forum, and also some foreign student groups, we have been able to raise funds and establish 30 fish sanctuaries. The evaluation of these sanctuaries by fishery experts has shown an increase in the fish stock. We have also managed to get the government to establish 14 fish sanctuaries over an area of two hectares. Additionally , five Panchayats manage five sanctuaries. the fIshIng communItIes have realised that these sanctuaries would make it possible to improve their lives and livelihoods. Fish sanctuaries have managed to curb overfishing. They also act as artificial mangroves that protect us from floods. The biggest achievement has been that these sanctuaries have raised awareness about sustainable fishing within a community that was once exploiting the lake without sparing a thought for the future. Changing habits can take time. But without changing our habits permanently , how can we expect a real change to happen?

This story is about Kahandal grass and Shindi trees that grow abundantly and the importance of which was discovered by my childhood friends \u2014 the brothers Goraksh Savreram Baramte and Tukaram Savreram Baramte. Kahandal grass grows in the month of June and matures in November or December and turns blackish, yellowish or copper in colour. In Purushwadi during Diwali parents buy toy guns and firecrackers for the children. Taking inspiration from the chakra (ground spinner) and serpent fireworks from the market, Goraksh and Tukaram made one using the Kahandal grass. Slowly they realised that using such layers, they could make rounded hats too. Then, purely using their imagination, they learnt to make flower vases, plates and models of temples, bullock carts, birds and owls. They even began weaving kurkula, used for storing bhakri (rice flatbread). Before this, we were getting used to plastic products from the market. Another tree in our village is the thorny Shindi, the leaves of which village folks rarely pluck to make brooms. But Goraksh Baramte began using the leaves from these clumps and crafting them with his imagination. He plucks and brings the bunch home, and after it dries up, he makes caps, flower vases, and shapes like trees out of them. From the craftsmanship of the brothers, I learnt that everything in nature has value. Every plant, tree and even wild grass that seems useless, can enrich our lives, create livelihoods, replace store-bought plastic and make us proud of our creativity .

A As lIttle k Ids, my siblings and I eagerly awaited the end of the long, cold winter. We live at 14000 feet in Maan village on the shores of the famous Pangong Lake, where the average temperature during winters often goes below -30 degrees celsius. And as winter sets in, the lake freezes over completely . A pristine layer of white! But the month of April brings with it the promise of warmer days, and the biggest annual festival in our village \u2014 the Maan Deram Chenmo festival. Under the warm spring sun the entire Pangong Lake melts at the same time with the water reflecting beautiful shades of blue. Divided by manmade boundaries and united by the Himalayas, the lake is sacred in our community . And as the lake melts, our village wakes up from its winter slumber too. Marking the beginning of the farming season, the Maan Deram Chenmo festival is celebrated with great pomp and show, including archery and horse riding. Right from Merak to Spangmik, people make their way to the festival from the entire region, to witness the beauty of Pangong Lake and welcome summer together. As a youngster, I longed to perfect my archery skills so I, too, could participate in the festival. My father taught me during my childhood and assured me that I'd have a fine aim one day . We'd retire after the lessons and as my father sat down with it, I'd pester him (and he would refuse) to let me have a taste of chhang \u2014 the local barley beer. Fast forward to years later, I was old enough and managed to hit the target in archery during the festival. And my reward? The khatak (traditional scarf), and chhang! dur Ing the festival we offer butter, barley and flowers to Lhato \u2014 the protector of our village.

There's a deer dancing at your door!\" The Kullu region in Himachal Pradesh comes alive with these words and the beats of drums \u2014 dhol and nagada to be precise. Children roam about the mountain villages, loudly singing songs like this to celebrate their favorite event \u2014 Haran. A part of the famous week-long Kullu Dussehra that symbolises victory of good over evil, Haran is primarily celebrated by Himachali kids. The pure joy of it, however, manages to draw participation from the elders too. I was aged 9 when I first attended Haran. My overprotective mother was against the idea of me participating in it and convincing her was tough. She relented only when a few friends from the village decided to join me. I never missed any opportunity to attend the celebration thereafter. According to popular folklore, Haran has its origin in the Hindu epic, Ramayana. It is believed that prior to his exile to the forest, Lord Ram wore the deer costume to take Sita, his wife, to the forest in a disguise. PhoTograPhs: shuTTersTockjuly 2021 76himachal vori Before taking the Haran costume out into the village, the kids decorate it. They make antlers from maize stems, decorate the costume with flowers, adorn it with Kulluvi pattu, handloom shawls, and wrap it with a white stole. They also make marigold garlands, and place them around the neck of the Haran. Two kids \u2014 one standing and the other stooping \u2014 alternate turns. They wear the Haran costume and dance in tandem to the rhythm of various local percussion instruments. As the Haran progresses to every household in the village, more kids join the celebration, and sing and dance in unison. Although the Haran is taken out only during the night, it never deters the participants \u2014 aged mostly between nine and 16 \u2014 from happily agreeing to walk in the dark. My fear of darkness was always overcome when the older kids strategically placed me in the middle of the group. With a vacation for all seven days of the Kullu Dussehra, the kids' enthusiasm to participate in the festival runs high. eAch d Ay, two villages, spread almost across an area of five kilometres, are chosen for the procession, which begins at around six in the evening and lasts till ten at night. While kids are the highlight of the procession, elderly folks accompany them to ensure safety . As the deer makes a stop in front of every household, the residents give grains such as maize and wheat along with coins to the kids. Some people also throw walnuts which the kids are happy to catch. When the weather gets cold, the participants generally halt for a break, start a fire and turn it into a celebration by dancing around it. To avoid walking long distances on an empty stomach, the participants are generally found with rotis children eagerly await to witness the procession two kids \u2014 one standing and the other stooping \u2014 wear the haran costume and dance in tandem to the rhythm of various local percussion instruments as more kids join the celebrationsoutlook tr AVeller 77 himachal vori abouT The sToryTeller KAniKA hails the bihar village in the banjar Tehsil of kullu district in himachal Pradesh. she is pursuing arts in college and loves to read stories about culture. a nature lover, she enjoys trekking, and loves to teach children. she aspires to be a school teacher.

It was the same with me and whenever hunger pangs hit, we'd take out the food and eat together. On the seventh day of Kullu Dussehra, the Haran enters the native village where the kids dance and enact plays. The grains collected from people's homes during the first six days are then sold and the proceeds are donated to organise a community feast where everyone from the village is invited \u2014 especially the participants of Haran. After the community feast, people return to their homes, only to wait eagerly for next year's Kullu Dussehra. Each year everyone in the village looks forward to Haran. It feels as though an immensely entertaining play is being enacted for you.

Children wake up early, bathe and get ready for the Ghughuti festival. I, too, wake up at 4 am \u2014 well before the sun rises from behind the Panchachuli mountains. In the bitter cold, and after washing the mud plastered floor of the kitchen and courtyard, I bathe and light the lamp in my temple room. By one o' clock, my ghuguti are ready - made by kneading the crows awaiting their feast the deeply fried ghughutis ghughuti garlands and when the family gathered at home, mother narrated the tale of how the Ghughuti festival began. Many moons ago, Kumaon was ruled by King Kalyan of the Chandra dynasty. He was childless and worried about who would be his heir to the throne. One night, Lord Bagnaath appeared in his dreams in the form of Lord Shiva and said to the King, \"If you build a temple in my name, a child will be born to you.\" The king and the queen were elated, and built a temple which is situated in Bageshwar and can be visited to this day. They bore a boy and lovingly named him Ghughuti. A garland of bells (similar to a ghungroo) was placed around the child's neck and that too was called Ghughuti. Whenever Ghughuti, the boy, behaved naughtily, the queen would teasingly say wheat flour with jaggery and ghee in milk, then deep frying in oil. Each year, as I make garlands of ghughuti and give them to the children of my village, I fondly remember my mother's home.

Supported by - Himalayan Ark info Deskthat she'd give his garland to the crows. The trick worked! There was a minister in the king's court who wanted to become the next king, and to fulfill his ambition, he hatched a plan to kill Ghughuti. One day he lured the child and took off to the jungle with him. A few crows saw the minister sneaking out of the palace with the child. The crows followed them deep into the forest. At one opportune moment, a crow swooped and snatched the garland off Ghughutis's neck and flew away with it to the king's palace. Meanwhile, in the palace, the king and queen were extremely worried at Ghughuti's disappearance. The king suspected that the minister \u2014 who was ambitious and seemed jealous of Ghughuti \u2014 must have planned an evil act. He sent all his ministers and royal guards in search of Ghughuti.When the ministers caught sight of the crow with the garland of bells in its beak, they informed the king and queen, who were sure the crow bore good news. It guided them to where Ghughuti was hidden. The kingdom was overjoyed on having found the child. The king and queen bowed to the crow repeatedly, and punished the minister who had plotted to kill Ghughuti. In celebration of Ghughuti's return, the royal couple threw a lavish banquet. This was the last day of the month of Paush and the crows were to be fed first. But as evening descended, the crows could not attend the feast. They were especially invited for the feast the next day - the first day of the month of Maagh. To this day, we show our appreciation to the black crows through the Ghughuti festival. The first dishes of the day are cooked in their honor, and fed to them when they answer the summoning calls across Kumaon. Children then roam the village with their edible Ghughuti garlands draped around their necks, nibbling away at it all day. *Maagh is the eleventh month of the Hindu calendar, which corresponds with January / February of the Gregorian calendar.

Every winter, as white snow enveloped the mountains of Bihar - our little village in the Tirthan Valley of Himachal Pradesh - all village families came together to cook local delicacies during the 'Magh Mahina'. We celebrate local festivals almost every single month of the year. But Magh Mahina - each year from January 15 to February 15 - is a special month dedicated to local delicacies. In the cold mountain winter, it brings together the warmth of families, friends and food. It was introduced by our ancestors a long time ago and is still the most awaited month of the year. As kids, my grandfather and his friends would go from one home to another, asking fellow villagers for walnuts to doughnuts), babru (sweet fritters), and lucchi and puri (sweet or salted fried breads) among others. Of these, bhalla holds a special place in our hearts because the recipe has been passed down by women of each family for generations. For me, learning how to cook the perfect bhalla was quite a ride. This flavourful dish is made by soaking maash ki dal (white urad) or black gram overnight. It is then bonded together with flour, rolled into tiny rotis and fried in either oil or ghee. The perfect bhalla is round, soft yet crispy , and slowly melts in your mouth with an explosion of spicy flavours. The very first serving of any dish prepared during Magh Mahina is pledged to Kul Devta, the local deity . This is done by either throwing some food in the fire, or in between the slates of the roof. We believe that Kul Devta takes care of our family , home and village. The three days following the end of Magh Mahina - known as Saaje - mark the beginning of a new month, so we pledge munch on. Every family would gather together in the evening to light a fire and roast the walnuts over it, warming up on chilly winter days, sharing stories, laughing and bonding. Back in the day , families of the village always struggled with their finances. Cooking several dishes was not always practical. But despite the challenges, they would still come together to cook, even if it meant choosing only one dish. It was a time of celebration after all. These days, women cook a variety of local dishes, including bhalla (fried lentil women place a walnut each in the four corners of their cowshed. young children try to make the most of this opportunity by waking up early in the morning to steal the walnuts drying corn on the rooftop cIaT (cc)outlook is of geography from bihar village in himachal Pradesh. she loves to play volleyball, dance and sing. she is a trained beautician and dreams of becoming a professional make-up artist someday.

During this time, women place a walnut each in the four corners of their cowshed as a token of respect. Young children try to make the most of this opportunity by waking up early in the morning to steal the walnuts.

Back in those days, there was no electricity so I would startle my mother every time she came to the cowshed. These days, the availability of light bulbs has taken away some of the thrill of hiding in the darkness - but kids still have their share of fun.
