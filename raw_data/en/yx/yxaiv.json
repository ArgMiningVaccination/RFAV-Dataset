His goal is to provide relief, renewal, and the restoration of balance to the patient's body, mind, spirit and general well-being. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) TCM is one of the oldest healing medical systems on the planet. It has been continuously practiced for thousands of years. Ancient Chinese believed that humans are microcosms of the larger universe, interconnected with nature and subject to the forces of nature. Balance between health and disease is the foundation of TCM. It is a stable and comprehensive medical system able to incorporate successful new methods of treatment. Researchers have been applying scientific methodology to aspects of TCM for decades. TCM is highly respected for effectively treating common ailments and difficult health conditions. The National Institute of Health (NIH) has classified TCM as a complete medical system. TCM is more preventative in nature than Modern Western Medicine. The relationship between physician and patient is close, like family. Body, mind and spirit are considered to have an integral relationship and are given equal weight when TCM practitioner analyzes the cause of imbalance. TCM pays close attention to the emotional roots of illness focusing on Anger, Sadness, Worry, Fear and Joy. In addition to the emotions, climate and environmental factors like cold, heat and dampness may play an important role in specific illnesses. Acupuncture Acupuncture is a fundamental tool of TCM. It is a system of medical diagnosis and treatment originally developed in China over thousands of years. Acupuncture stimulates locations in the body with fine needles to promote the body's self healing homeostatic processes. Acupuncture is Evidence Based Medicine that is safely used by millions of people world-wide. Treatment Acupuncturists are required to undergo extensive education, including in-depth Western Medical training. Acupuncturists use pre-sterilized, disposable, single-use needles to ensure patient safety. With sterile single use disposable needles the risk of infectious disease transmission through Acupuncture is minimal. Adverse effects are uncommon and generally limited to temporary and mild tissue irritation around needle sites, typical of any procedure involving needles. Read more about Integrating Acupuncture and TCM with Western Medicine. There are fewer adverse effects associated with Acupuncture than with many standard drug treatments (such as anti-inflammatory medication and steroid injections) used to manage painful musculoskeletal conditions like fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, osteoarthritis etc. Read more about What Can Acupuncture Treat. Acupuncture triggers the body's own self-healing reflexes through stimulation of neural, vascular, immune and endocrine responses that result in pain control and muscle relaxation. Acupuncture reduces inflammation and swelling, normalizing blood flow and lymphatic drainage. Acupuncture enhances tissue and wound healing, enhancing normalized immune response, increasing joint range of motion, normalizing organ activity reducing stress and enhancing mood. Read more About Acupuncture. Acupuncture releases neurotransmitters such as endorphins serotonin and norepinephrine. Acupuncture stimulates the nervous system to release adrenocorticotropic hormones, promotes vasodilation and increases blood flow. Acupuncture connects acupoints with corresponding brain structures observed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI). This may explain why Acupuncture relieves pain, reduces inflammation, helps wounds heal faster, treats stroke and many other conditions. Read more about Types of Acupuncture. E-Stim / Electro-acupuncture Herbal medicine Herbs and plant-based remedies have provided effective relief to people for centuries. While many cultures have herbal medicine traditions, the sophistication, safety and effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine is unsurpassed. Today, Western medicine is rediscovering the potency and efficacy of herbal and plant-based treatments in the development of new, more effective medicines for disease and illness. SCOMC may use Chinese herbs alone or as part of your Acupuncture treatment plan. Neal has training experience and a deep understanding of the proper use of these ancient remedies. Manual Therapy/Asian Massage (Tuina-Acupressure-Sports Massage) Moxibustion (Moxa) Moxibustion involves the heating of Acupuncture points with smoldering herb called mugwort (known as Moxa) Moxibustion stimulates circulation, counteracts cold and dampness in the body and promotes circulation. Moxibustion is a great tool for Orthopedic Fertility and digestive disorders. Cupping (Myofascial Decompression) Cupping stretches muscles upwards from underlying bone and connective tissue. It triggers profound muscle relaxation reflexes. Cupping pumps blood and lymphatic fluid through tight, adhered or restricted muscles, removing waste and bringing new oxygen and nutrients to injured areas. Amateur cupping is simple to do. But cupping therapy has a very complicated mechanism. Local heat cupping therapy increases blood circulation, metabolic rate and nutrition distribution, increasing lymphatic circulation, changes in osmotic pressure and reduction of muscle tissue inflammation. Generalized cupping increases permeability of the capillaries which produce local bruising. It may induce self-hemolysis. This provides mild stimulation to the capillary system. Cupping was used and made popular outside of China by Ancient Egyptians. Over time it spread to Europe and then to North America. Today cupping is a very popular therapy in the USA with physical therapists, athletic trainers, massage therapists and chiropractors. Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners are the world's best-trained and experienced experts in the Art and Science of cupping. Neal Miller is considered an expert in cupping procedures by his peers and students. He has taught at the National Board of Acupuncture Orthopedics approved programs at St Vincent's Medical Center and at the Fred Lerner DC NBAO courses at Cedars Sinai medical center and several local Acupuncture Traditional Medicine Colleges. There are many cupping techniques that we incorporate into our Acupuncture Traditional Medicine program at SCOMC. This includes: Alpha Stim Alpha-Stim is a handheld, FDA-approved medical device for the treatment of acute, post-traumatic and chronic pain without drugs or their side-effects, including the possibility for addiction. It is also useful in treating anxiety, insomnia, and depression. The principle behind this technology is the generation of a specific electrical waveform to cause your cells to rebalance themselves and eliminate the conditions noted above. Gua Sha Gua Sha is a technique very similar to cupping. Gua means to scrape or scratch and Sha is a heat skin rash. The technique of Gua Sha intentionally brings the SHA rash to the surface. Gua Sha breaks up painful myofascial trigger points and relieves myalgia. Gua Sha stretches and loosens restrictions in muscle and connective tissue. Gua Sha flushes capillary beds and lymphatic ducts increasing local microcirculation. Traditionally, a porcelain Chinese soup spoon, smooth polished Jade or animal horn is used to scrape the skin. Oil or herbal powder is applied to facilitate smooth rubbing. Long gentle strokes are applied until bruising \"Sha\" appears on the skin. Gua Sha is used where pain and heat stagnation are present. The treatment itself is very simple and relatively pain free in the care of educated well experienced hands. However in untrained hands like with cupping, it can be rather uncomfortable and often painful, especially when used on bony parts of the body. Tai Qi (Tai Chi) Tai Qi developed originally as a self-defense martial art. Over the centuries, it has evolved to include health benefits for those who use it. Tai Qi focuses on relaxing, stimulating and balancing the practitioner's mind, body and spirit. Slow, graceful, controlled movements characterize its practice. Benefits include a reduction in stress, better balance, improved posture confidence and a general improved sense of well-being. Qi Gong Qi Gong is a traditional Chinese therapeutic exercise incorporating rounded postures, gentle, light and firm movements. Qi Gong is easy to learn. It is practiced for thousands of years by millions of people of ALL ages. Qi Gong enhances the immune system, increases stamina, improves digestion and circulation, structural balance, promotes restful sleep and reduces stress. People use Qi Gong to benefit the central nervous system, get relief from chronic illness, and for general well-being. Wellness, Lifestyle and Nutritional Counseling Balanced health requires a balanced lifestyle. Lifestyle counseling includes recommendations about daily habits. Diet, exercise, sleep patterns, stress reduction through meditation, connection to self, connection to others and connection to the environment are important factors affecting Lifestyle nutrition and health. Acupuncture and TCM can be used to improve lifestyle habits with safe effective treatment for stress reduction, mental health, weight loss drug addiction, smoking cessation and insomnia. \"Food is medicine\" is a TCM concept that has a history dating back thousands of years. Acupuncture TCM providers have extensive training in Traditional Nutrition Counseling. Many cultures have herbs that are cooked with food to enhance therapeutic effect and treat many types of illness and disease. Neal's background as a Chef plays an important role in teaching patients the importance of eating fresh, delicious, healthy meals and snacks. Changing habits through behavior modification, adopting healthy lifestyle choices, eating fresh quality foods, exercise, restorative sleep, avoidance of toxins and management of five emotions (Anger, Sadness, Worry, Fear and Joy) create a healthy plan. A good health plan can keep us from using our sick plan (health insurance). We at SCOMC help patients create a Health Plan that is individual to each individual patient's situation. The fundamental principles of preventing sickness promoting health care are from adopting lifestyle changes, improving diet, nutrition and making changes to activities of Daily Living. Balance is the key to good health, healing and happiness.
