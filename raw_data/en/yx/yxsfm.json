Each individual has an innate healing potential, expressed as a Vital Force, which must be encouraged, not blocked or suppressed. This is the philosophy of Dr David Nye, a registered General Practitioner and Homeopath, and of Dr Sandi Nye, a registered Naturopath. We both practise [Integrative Medicine](http://www.greenhousehealth.com/integrative-medicine/), focussing on treatment of difficult and complex dis-ease situations, as well as dealing with day-to-day problems. We believe that you, the patient, need to take responsibility for your health, whereas we are here to guide and assist you in that quest. It is not our aim to dictate but to form a team with you to negotiate and plan how best to achieve optimum health. This is the essence of an holistic and integrative approach to health. [Dr David Nye and Dr Sandi Nye share their interests in current healthcare topics, including debunking myths, alternative therapies and useful recipes.](http://www.greenhousehealth.com/health-bytes/) [What is Homeopathy? Acupuncture? Naturopathy? Chinese Herbal Medicine, and others?](http://www.greenhousehealth.com/philosophies/) [Our practice offers a wide variety of integrative & orthodox treatments and/or information. ](http://www.greenhousehealth.com/treatments/) [All information on this site is provided by Dr's David & Sandi Nye. ](http://www.greenhousehealth.com/meet-doctors-nye/) Those suffering with chronic ill health know that it is a journey with many ups and downs, many hopes and disappointments. Treatment of [chronic disease](http://www.greenhousehealth.com/chronic-disease/) is very complex and one can easily be confused by the abundance of conflicting information to be found on the internet. We offer you a structured, logical, evidence-based and individualised program in order to achieve the best results. Conventional medicine seldom offers a cure for chronic disease; but it can be life saving in acute emergencies and acute disease. An [ integrative approach](http://www.greenhousehealth.com/integrative-medicine/) is needed to address the complex dysfunctions in chronic disease, and to bring about metabolic and energetic balance to restore the body to self-regulatory optimal function. Before your first appointment, you will be asked to complete and submit a comprehensive questionnaire, detailing your past health history, lifestyle and current issues. At your initial consultation of 60 minutes, we will examine your health history, using the completed questionnaire, and perform a physical examination. Appropriate tests will be discussed and arranged, as needed. Treatment may be commenced immediately using nutritional interventions, medicines, supplements, or other modalities; or we may elect to await the results of relevant tests before starting treatment. A management plan is drawn up, listing all recommended tests, lifestyle changes and treatments, to act as a reference for what needs to be done. Although we both practise [Integrative Medicine](http://www.greenhousehealth.com/integrative-medicine/), the patient may at any stage choose to pursue a more [Naturopathic](http://www.greenhousehealth.com/naturopathy/) approach with Dr Sandi, or a more [Homeopathic](http://www.greenhousehealth.com/homeopathy/) approach with Dr David. Each person with his/her dis-ease is very individual, thus the above schedule is merely a guide, as the path of healing is different for everyone. [Apart from the well known chronic diseases, there are states of ill-health that are difficult to classify, and hence frustrating to treat. These so-called \"grey areas\" are often characterised by normal blood tests in spite of debilitating symptoms. These situations require a special integrative approach to address them. ](http://www.greenhousehealth.com/newbeta/chronic-disease/) [READ MORE](http://www.greenhousehealth.com/chronic-disease/) [Integrative medicine is all about health and healing, rather than about diseases and their treatment.
