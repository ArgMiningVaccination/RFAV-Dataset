Danny Holdsworth followed his instincts and followed up on unusual pain that turned out to be testicular cancer. A young dad faces down a cancer diagnosis, while a nurse becomes the patient. Daniel \"Danny\" Holdsworth was a healthy husband, father, and local deputy sheriff when he began experiencing testicular pain in 2018. After visiting his primary care team at MedStar Medical Group at Charlotte Hall, the 35-year-old went for ultrasound testing\u2014which uncovered a lump. With youth on his side, cancer wasn't the first thing on his mind. Still, Danny was referred to Ryan Hankins, MD , a board-certified urologist at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, part of the MedStar Georgetown Cancer Institute, which combines medical expertise and the latest therapies at MedStar Health with access to cancer research expertise through Georgetown Lombardi 4 | Healthy Living Summer 2021 Healthy Living Summer 2021 | 5Stay on top of your healthJune is Men's Health Month \"We often hear about the importance of women's self-exams, but not necessarily men's self-exams,\" said Stephen Michaels, MD , chief medical officer and chief operating officer at MedStar St. Mary's. \"If caught early, issues like testicular cancer can often be treated with positive outcomes. But men may be reluctant to admit that there is a problem, especially in a sensitive area\u2014and by the time they seek help, a smaller issue has become more complicated.\" Schedule regular check-ups . Routine physicals can help keep your health on track. In addition to a general check-up, your provider will likely check your weight and blood pressure, review your medications, and order bloodwork for your glucose and cholesterol levels. Share your family history. Depending on your lifestyle and age, a family history of disease may lead to earlier recommendations for screenings such as colon, prostate, or lung cancer. Exercise. At least 30 minutes a day is ideal, but even short bursts of activity\u2014a quick walk around the neighborhood, time spent on yardwork\u2014will benefit your heart and relieve stress. Protect your skin. When outside, cover exposed skin with sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher), wear protective clothing, and take breaks in the shade. See a dermatologist annually, or when you notice new or unusual moles. Conduct monthly skin checks for the same. If you smoke, quit. Tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema and heart disease, plus many types of cancer. Talk with your provider about resources to help you quit for good.Comprehensive Cancer Center. Joined by his wife, Joni, the couple met with Dr. Hankins\u2014a urologic oncology specialist\u2014to discuss Danny's results. Dr. Hankins confirmed it was a tumor. Testicular cancer is a less common type of cancer\u2014representing just 0.5% of new cancer cases in 2020, according to the National Cancer Institute. It is, however, the most common cancer found in American men ages 15 to 35. Though the exact cause of testicular cancer is unknown, the disease is considered highly treatable, especially if found early. Formed in the tissues of one or both testicles, its first symptom is most often a lump or swelling and enlargement of the testicle. Other signs may include testicle or scrotum pain or discomfort; a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum; back pain; and a dull ache in the abdomen or groin, among other symptoms. It's also possible that an individual will have no symptoms at all. While still processing the diagnosis, the Holdsworths noted that Dr. Hankins had already started looking to move around his schedule. Danny was headed for surgery. \"Whoa, whoa\u2014is this really happening?\" Danny recalled thinking, noting the team was springing into action immediately. With two young sons at home, Danny and Joni quickly made childcare arrangements. His surgery took place just two days later. As part of the surveillance period following the procedure, Danny worked with Nancy Ann Dawson, MD , a renowned expert in genitourinary cancer at MedStar Georgetown and Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Washington, D.C., region's only National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center, and the Institute's research engine. Through this partnership, patients like Danny have access to groundbreaking clinical trials and the latest breakthroughs in cancer care. Under Dr. Dawson's care, Danny underwent regular CT scans to check for signs the cancer had returned. Two years later, imaging revealed it had\u2014and spread to his abdomen as well. \"At this point, I knew this meant chemotherapy, and I also knew it wasn't feasible to head into the city daily for treatment,\" said Danny. \"Luckily, with a nurse in the house, I already knew we were fortunate to have great options here for local care.\" Joni, a nurse at MedStar St. Mary's Hospital, was familiar with the hospital's many services close to home. Danny soon met with Amir M. Khan, MD, board-certified oncologist and medical director of MedStar Georgetown Cancer Institute at MedStar St. Mary's, who was already collaborating with Dr. Dawson on Danny's plan of care. \"Dr. Khan is very knowledgeable and so great at what he does,\" Danny said. \"I felt I was getting the same level of personalized treatment here as we were at MedStar Georgetown.\" Chemotherapy at MedStar St. Mary's began in February 2020. Danny was set for four cycles, each lasting three weeks\u2014but the plan paused as Danny soon fell ill after the first treatment, growing feverish with chills. He was hospitalized for a week after developing leukopenia, a low white blood cell count that is often a side effect of chemo. White blood cells act as a defense for the human body\u2014and with so few, Danny couldn't easily fight off infection. Then the COVID-19 pandemic arrived. \"I was immunocompromised due to the chemo, so of course we already had limited exposure to everybody,\" Danny said. \"Still, it was scary. We were all cautious. My wife was very, very cautious.\" Through the anxiety of that time, there were still some silver linings. When Danny's 34th birthday fell on a weekday during a chemo cycle, he arrived to find a specially-decorated treatment bay set up just for the occasion. \"Those are little things that mean a lot,\" he said. \"The whole team there is fantastic. As soon as you come in, you're treated like family.\" Danny wrapped up his final treatment in April 2020. He continues to undergo regular testing for signs of recurrent cancer, but he is feeling great\u2014back to running after his 6- and 7-year-old boys, assisting with their virtual learning, and working nights while wife Joni cares for patients alongside a team of compassionate oncology nurses. One of whom happens to be a recent cancer survivor herself.\"I felt I was getting the same level of personalized treatment here as we were at MedStar Georgetown.\" -Danny Holdsworth'Now I've sat in that chair' Teresa Gould, RN, OCN , is a familiar face at MedStar Georgetown Cancer Institute at MedStar St. Mary's Hospital\u2014a member of the tight-knit team caring for patients, including Danny, with a wide range of cancers. \"Nursing was always something I wanted to do\u2014but I didn't pursue it until later in life because I didn't have the confidence,\" shared Teresa. It wasn't until after she'd welcomed two children and returned from living abroad that she enrolled in nursing school. She \"fell in love\" with the field during her first job on a medical/ surgical oncology unit, and Teresa has now been a nurse for 22 years. Three years ago, she also became an oncology patient. Teresa Gould with husband Dave, who was part of her strong support system during treatment for breast cancer. Continued on Page 6MedStar Georgetown Cancer Institute6 | Healthy Living Summer 2021 Healthy Living Summer 2021 | 7About MedStar Georgetown Cancer InstituteMedStar Georgetown Cancer Institute \"I was anxious to get started,\" Teresa said. \"Then, after the first dose of chemo with the clinical trial drug, an MRI showed almost total resolution of the tumor in my breast. At that point, I was excited about the results, but hesitant because I knew how bad side effects could get. Still, I was hopeful.\" Dave stayed steadfastly by Teresa's side\u2014an especially challenging journey after the loss of his father to lung cancer just two years before. Teresa's daughter and son, both in their thirties, stayed upbeat. \"They reminded me of what I've been telling them for years: that patients live with cancer and overcome it all the time,\" said Teresa. \"Their attitude was always, 'Mom, you'll beat this.'\" After the conclusion of the clinical trial, Teresa returned to MedStar St. Mary's with relief. She would be close to home while following the standard of care for triple-negative breast cancer as outlined by Dr. Khan and Claudine Isaacs, MDCM, FRCPC , co-director of the Breast Cancer Program and medical director of the Jess and Mildred Fisher Center for Hereditary Cancer and Clinical Genomics Research at the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center. Drs. Isaacs and Khan stayed in frequent communication on Teresa's treatment. Sherry Wolfe, RN, OCN, Teresa's longtime coworker and friend served as her primary nurse. \"Sherry was comforting to me, but maybe even more so for my husband,\" Teresa said. \"She encouraged Dave to voice his concerns and ask questions, which gave him confidence that he really could help care for me. And when I was in that chair, she treated me like a patient, but also acknowledged that I knew some of what to expect. Working with all of these nurses for so many years, I knew I was in good hands.\" Teresa's story is one of gratitude and success: she is now in remission. She feels well and continues to undergo regular scans and check-ins with her oncology team. As a full-time nurse, Teresa now assists patients where she sat in triage herself not long ago. Danny Holdsworth was among those she cared for after returning to her duties. \"I've gained so much knowledge from my patients over the years,\" Teresa said. \"There were still some surprises, though. I was really surprised by how much my head hurt when my hair felt out. No one had ever told me that. Now I know this is a side effect, and something patients might deal with, so I can reassure them.\" More than anything, Teresa has firsthand knowledge of the cancer experience that has translated into even deeper empathy for patients and their families. \"Now I've sat in that chair,\" she said. \"I've been there. And I can really walk with them.\"The 54-year-old discovered a lump in her breast in March 2018. At work the next morning, she shared her concern with Dr. Khan. Subsequent scans and testing confirmed a mass. Teresa met with Patricia Wehner, MD , board-certified surgeon and attending physician in the MedStar Breast Health Program at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, who has a practice at the MedStar Women's Specialty Care office in Leonardtown. After a biopsy, Dr. Wehner soon called to confirm what the nurse herself suspected: she had breast cancer. \"Like anyone, I was overwhelmed,\" Teresa said. Her maternal grandmother and aunt had battled the disease, and she had seen firsthand that cancer impacts people from all walks of life. But the mother of two, then 52, still felt stunned. Teresa was diagnosed with triple negative invasive ductal carcinoma, a particular type of breast cancer that can grow and spread faster than other types of the disease. Triple-negative breast cancer accounts for 10 to 15% of all breast cancers, with treatment options limited by the fact that the cancer cells don't have estrogen or progesterone receptors, which can be targeted with therapies, and don't make much of the protein HER2 (triple-negative). It was time to fight back. Teresa returned to Dr. Khan to strategize. \"Dr. Khan is always looking at what's best for the patient,\" said Teresa. \"During our first 'official' meeting, based on the type of breast cancer I had, he suggested going to MedStar Georgetown for a clinical trial through the hospital's research partner. At first, I was disappointed because I work with an amazing group of nurses and I know what great care we deliver here. But I knew I'd be in excellent hands.\" With the support of her husband, Dave, Teresa did her own research on the clinical trial for an antibody drug used in immunotherapy. The medication had proven effective in shrinking the tumors associated with other cancers, but its ability to fight breast cancer was still under review. \"I know how much valuable information researchers get from these trials, and what it can do to advance treatment for other patients,\" Teresa said. \"With Dr. Khan's support, I agreed to join.\" Following 12 weeks of chemotherapy, Teresa began treatments of an antibody infusion medication at MedStar Georgetown. Her emotions at the time ran the gamut.

Now practicing in Leonardtown, Dr. Chen offers insight into a common condition that, if left untreated, has the potential to cause serious complications. Q. What is sinusitis, its causes, and symptoms? Sinusitis, or rhinosinusitis, is an inflammation of the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses, the group of four, paired, air-filled spaces surrounding the nasal cavity. Caused by viral upper respiratory infections, bacteria, and noninfectious conditions, symptoms of sinusitis may include a runny nose, nasal congestion, facial pain and pressure, headaches, post- nasal drip, sore throat, cough, and bad breath. Q. How are people diagnosed with sinusitis? Sinusitis can be diagnosed through an in-depth discussion of the patient's history and a physical examination that often involves a nasal exam. A nasal endoscopy\u2014an in-office procedure using a flexible tube with a tiny camera and a light\u2014may also be performed. Your doctor will look for signs of swelling, congestion, and infection; the shape and size of your nasal passages; and obstruction resulting from a deviated septum. Additional laboratory testing and computed tomography (CT) imaging may be ordered. Allergy testing and immune function testing may be needed to diagnosis underlying conditions in patients with chronic sinusitis. Q. Are some people more likely to get sinusitis? People with certain underlying illnesses are prone to getting sinusitis including those with allergies, asthma, cystic fibrosis, and patients who are immunocompromised or who have ciliary dyskinesia, a genetic condition affecting the respiratory system. Q. What treatments help with chronic sinusitis? Treatments typically include conservative, watchful waiting or oral antibiotics. For people with chronic sinusitis, a nasal saline spray, topical steroid, and systemic steroid therapy may be prescribed. In certain situations, sinusitis Achy head, runny nose, sore throat? It could be sinusitis.Q Awith Frank S. Chen, MD, PhD & Dr. Chen is now accepting new patients!

Sinus surgery is typically performed using endoscopic techniques with imaging guidance. Q. What happens if sinusitis is left untreated? Without treatment, the infection can extend beyond the sinuses and lead to severe complications including infections of the tissues surrounding the eye or the mastoid bone behind the ear; abscesses around the eye or in the brain; and\u2014in rare cases\u2014blood clots in the vein running from the brain to the back of the eye. These complications typically will require urgent evaluation, IV antibiotics, and surgical interventions.Meet our new medical professionals.

Barbara Magrogan had finally had enough. For the past year and a half, Barbara endured continuously worsening shoulder pain that was robbing the active 71-year-old of the ability to enjoy most of her hobbies\u2014horseback riding, kayaking, and wildlife photography. \"My shoulder was bothering me for a long time. About a year ago, it really came to a head,\" said Barbara, who had rotator cuff repairs on both shoulders performed by a previous doctor. \"I knew what was going on, I just didn't realize it was that bad until I was trying to kayak last spring and ride horses. And I kept telling my husband, 'It just doesn't even feel like it's connected.'\" A recommendation from a friend led her to MedStar Orthopaedic Institute in Leonardtown and orthopaedic surgeon John A. Kuri, II, MD.\"I loved him the minute I met him,\" said Barbara. \"I know my body really well and when I sat down and told him, 'I'm crying uncle, I need your help, I just can't live like this any longer,' he said, 'We are going to fix you.' It is a lot to trust a brand-new doctor (to the area), but we had a good connection and that doesn't happen very often.\" An X-ray and MRI confirmed what Barbara was feeling\u2014there was extensive damage to her shoulder and surgery would be necessary to alleviate her pain and get her back to her busy life. The condition was most likely the result of an accident about a year prior during which a horse penned Barbara in a trailer, bruising her ribs on the right side and cracking her sternum. She later realized her shoulder was injured at that time as well. \"It was caused by a trauma and then I continued to use it and it just deteriorated and deteriorated until it got to the point where I said, 'Stop, I can't do this anymore,'\" said Barbara. Barbara underwent surgery in October 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise for her. A horse show judge for 50 years, Barbara's normally busy travel schedule was put on hold during the pandemic giving her time to attend physical therapy and concentrate on her recovery. And she was never worried about having the procedure during the pandemic. \"It was all because of how relaxed Dr. Kuri made me feel about it,\" More space, more services, more convenience.

Following surgery to repair a shoulder injury, she now has a second shot at enjoying her hobbies such as photographing birds visiting the feeder in her yard. Local photographer, horse enthusiast gets her life back following surgery. said Barbara. \"He is very mellow, and he listens, and takes whatever time you need. I was looking forward to the surgery, I wanted it to be all over.\" After four months of physical therapy, Barbara was nearly back to normal this spring and was released from Dr. Kuri's care in April. \"This time a year ago, I couldn't kayak anymore, I couldn't hold my camera, I couldn't do anything,\" said Barbara. \"I am extremely active\u2014I don't stop.\" Dr. Kuri told her she needed to follow all of the post-operative, rehabilitation protocols and be careful with her activities while she healed. \"I did exactly what I was told and now I am back,\" said Barbara. \"Dr. Kuri gave me my life back.\" MedStar Orthopaedic Institute at Leonardtown recently opened its new office on Hollywood Road.

Remaly, MsEd, MPT , a therapist with the Pelvic Rehabilitation Program at MedStar St. Mary's Hospital. \"But most people will say, 'This has been a really positive experience for me.'\" That is true for Deanna Gleisner of Hollywood, Maryland. Deanna sought out pelvic floor therapy following a routine OB/GYN visit during which she was diagnosed with a prolapsed bladder. An active 65-year- old trying to stay healthy and keep up with her grandchildren, Deanna wanted to take action to prevent future surgery. \"After my daughter had her babies, she went to Robin to strengthen her pelvic floor. She talked about how that made such a difference for her,\" said Deanna. \"I am just one of those people that I would prefer not to have surgery; I would rather do something more natural to stop it from going in that direction.\" \"We treat a variety of issues with the bowel and bladder including incontinence, urgency, and constipation,\" said Robin. \"Each person is unique and presents a little like a puzzle, as typically patients present with more than one issue at the same time. Fortunately, more often than not, as one issue resolves, so do the others.\" Regardless of the diagnosis, the therapists will take time to get to know the individual and talk with them about the issues they are facing. The program takes a whole person, individualized approach to address the patient's specific issues.\"We try to make their first appointments as comfortable as possible\u2014we're going to use the formal names of things, we assure them we are here for them, we are going to answer questions, and give them education,\" said Robin. \"The first 15 minutes of their first visit we let them know this is going to be OK.\" Deanna said her visits with Robin involved a lot of education\u2014not just about the pelvic floor\u2014and helped her develop strategies that enabled her to handle her feelings of urgency. During therapy sessions she was taught exercises to help strengthen her pelvic floor muscles that complimented her already established exercise routine. \"We went over exercise, eating, drinking, my habits, and from there Robin gave me an education about the muscles on the pelvic floor, and core muscles,\" said Deanna. \"I learned a great deal about foods that irritate the bladder, how much I should be drinking, exercises I was already doing, and how to incorporate new exercises.\" Deanna says the Pelvic Rehabilitation Program has made a big difference in her day-to-day life\u2014she no longer feels panicked and rushing to the bathroom. \"It is very much a partnership, that's why I feel it has been so positive,\" said Deanna. \"The amount of education I have gotten has been incredible.\"Therapy helps improve quality of life by addressing pelvic floor dysfunction.

Deanna received help from the MedStar St. Mary's Hospital Pelvic Rehabilitation Program.\"Weight loss and weight management will always be very hard work, whether or not you have surgery,\" said Dr. Tapazoglou (pictured). \"But if you are suffering from health consequences of being overweight, surgery can be a safe and effective way of reversing many conditions\u2014or preventing them in the first place. I encourage patients to view our informational seminars or speak with other bariatric patients. If a patient has truly explored non-surgical weight loss options and not been successful, surgery can be a powerful tool.\"Bariatrics surgery, and 135 pounds less than her heaviest point. \"Bariatric surgery is a tool, not a quick fix\u2014a decision that requires daily commitment,\" she said. \"I'm so thankful for this tool.\" With the support of her family, bariatric coordinator Michelle McDonald, and Dr. Tapazoglou, Jessie continues to feel confident in having made that choice. She is also grateful for new friendships formed through the Bariatric Support Group. \"I really appreciate being able to connect with other patients\u2014sharing advice and helping each other stay on track,\" she said. \"Healthy eating will always need to be a conscious choice if I want to keep the weight off,\" Jessie said. \"But my family keeps me motivated. Teaching my children healthy habits is important to me.\" Bariatric surgery is a personal choice, she shared. \"Personally,\" said Jessie, \"it's the best decision I've ever made.\" Surgery helped her lose the weight. Determination has kept it off. Jessie Cardello first heard about bariatric surgery years ago\u2014years through which she tried many diets while trying to shed the extra weight she'd carried since childhood. Years in which, happily, she'd also married and welcomed four children. \"After having my first baby, I was up to 275 pounds,\" said Jessie, of Hollywood. \"I worked hard to get down to 180 with diet and exercise. But after three more children, I couldn't stay below 220.\" Seven years after first researching bariatric procedures, the 39-year- old revisited the idea as a way to change her relationship with food. Jessie connected with Nicholas Tapazoglou, MD , board-certified general surgeon and fellowship- trained bariatric surgeon at MedStar St. Mary's Hospital. She also began attending the hospital's monthly Bariatric Support Group meetings. Jessie ultimately chose to undergo a gastric sleeve procedure. The minimally- invasive, laparoscopic surgery involves removing parts of the stomach to form a smaller \"sleeve\"\u2014about 1/10th the size of the original stomach. Patients must eat much less and will feel full much quicker. The months- long preparation program includes education, dietitian appointments, and rigorous physical testing. Surgery day finally arrived in December 2018. \"My recovery went smoothly,\" said Jessie. \"Dr. T's skills as a surgeon made the healing process easier. I only had three tiny incisions, and no scars.\" Two and a half years later, Jessie is maintaining her weight at 140 pounds\u201475 pounds down from Ready to take a step toward a new life?

Jean Pierre El Khoury, MD , and Bruce Gibson, MD , intensivists at MedStar St. Mary's, directed Rick's care at a time so much remained unknown\u2014but testing confirmed he was, indeed, COVID-positive. As Rick struggled to breathe and move for himself, he remembers the compassion of the entire staff\u2014from the ED, to anesthesia, to associates in Environmental Services who brought \"positive energy\" into his room daily, even through their layers of PPE. \"Stem to stern, everyone was so kind and helpful,\" said Rick. \"The staff was great about keeping my wife updated. But I was in a bad place. Just bleak. I remember Dr. El Khoury coming in to ask how I was doing, and I was frank: I said well, I'm tunneling out. I'm dying.\" Rick was intubated again and placed back on a ventilator. But Rick's ravaged body fought back. Removed from the ventilator days later, he defied the odds and began breathing on his own. After eight harrowing days in intensive care, he was well enough to continue his recovery at home with Susan and their sons on April 4, 2020. In the year since, Rick hasn't forgotten the service of the entire MedStar St. Mary's team. He returned in April to extend his gratitude and see their smiling eyes above masks once again. Among the staff present were members of the nursing and respiratory therapy teams who cared for Rick around the clock last spring, charging his cell phone and trying to keep his spirits up. \"I'm so grateful to all of you,\" Rick told the team, which included nurses Betty Porter, BSN, RN, Katie Smith, RN, and Jennifer Sams, BSN, therapists , RRT, RRT-ACCS and Kristin Yeitrakis, MS, BSN, RN, NEA-BC, CEN , vice president and chief nursing officer. \"God has a plan for me\u2014I haven't quite figured out what it is yet. But I'm here because of you.\" In addition to generously sending meals for the staff, Rick and his family gifted the team a plaque featuring photos of two bald eagles he'd spotted on the Potomac River: one plunged into deep water, the other with wings opened wide against a clear blue sky. \"Even an eagle can be in trouble, sinking not soaring,\" he wrote. \"Thank you for saving my life and helping me soar again.\"COVID-19 Soaring, not sinking. COVID-19 patient returns to thank staff for life-saving care one year after discharge. Nearly one year to the day since his discharge, Rick Dressler\u2014 one of the first two COVID-19 patients admitted the same day to MedStar St. Mary's Hospital\u2014 returned to thank the staff for their roles in saving his life. Rick, 52, was traveling home from overseas military service when news reports of a fast- spreading coronavirus were gaining international traction. While COVID-19 was inching closer toward being declared a pandemic, the father of two was among thousands of travelers at a busy Amsterdam airport in March 2020. Back in Valley Lee, Rick soon fell ill\u2014experiencing debilitating migraines and terrible chills. His wife, Susan, tried to help by running him a warm bath. She said she'd added potent aromatherapy oils, but Rick discovered an alarming new symptom: he couldn't smell a thing. Next came the joint pain, \"like someone drilling into my bones,\" he described. Then kidney pain, exhaustion\u2014just terrible fatigue. \"It felt like if someone dropped you at 20,000 feet without oxygen, then made you walk and try to accomplish tasks,\" recalled Rick, a trained medic. \"It wasn't happening.\" The splitting migraines were what ultimately forced Rick to seek relief at MedStar St. Mary's Hospital's Emergency Department (ED) in March 2020. The team swabbed him for coronavirus, but results early on could take a week or longer to process. He went home to rest and wait. Rick's condition worsened. Three days later, Susan rushed her husband back\u2014he'd begun to cough up blood. \"Like so many people during the pandemic, my wife had to just drop me off,\" Rick said. \"I was worried about infecting my family, if I hadn't already. We didn't even hug\u2014just kind of fist-bumped. I said I hoped I'd see her again.\" A CT scan revealed Rick's lungs were severely compromised. Healthy just weeks earlier, Rick soon woke up on a ventilator in the Intensive Care Center Brothers Roger and William Dressler with the special plaque presented by their father, Rick, to the Intensive Care Center team and others who cared for him at MedStar St. Mary's Hospital.

I had the picture- perfect plan, had done my research and knew everything I wanted. But life of course happened, and my entire birthing experience became a situation of pure fear and panic, and ended in an unplanned c-section. I felt defeated and like I was grieving something. When I reached the postpartum side I had the same nurse, Sharon, both days. Her caring and empathetic nature, along with her quick responses and quality patient care, began to give me back some of the joy I felt had been lost. She made me feel cared for on a deeper level and as if I wasn't just another patient to monitor. I will always be thankful for the care Sharon provided when I was feeling pretty defeated.\" -Emily Simmons, Lexington Park \"Thank you to the staff and doctors for excellent service. I recently came to St. Mary's for rotator cuff surgery and was treated very well by all the staff, including Dr. Kuri, Tina Williams, Ashley B., Rosemary, Valerie McKay, Yhamira, Hollie, Rachel, and Maria. Given the times we are currently experiencing, I did not expect to get the personal care that was provided to me. Because of the excellent care and performance of the surgery team, my recovery is going better than expected. Thank you all for your work ethics and taking care of me so well.\" -Thomas White, Leonardtown \"I was brought in by ambulance and admitted to the ER due to an allergic reaction. It was later in the day I was fully aware of what was going on with me. Melinda was my attending nurse that evening. Melinda is a true healthcare professional, it is because of people like her healthcare professionals are held in high esteem. Melinda took the time to explain to me what was going on with me and called my wife multiple times to update her on my status. I knew Melinda was very busy since I saw her back and forth, but she made me feel like I was her primary concern. Thanks Melinda, you're awesome!\" -Paul Powell, Lexington Park Patient feedback fuels decisions at our hospital and throughout MedStar Health.

Jessica was chosen from among the exemplary associates who received recognition for going above and beyond in 2020. \"Without hesitation, colleagues describe Jessica as someone who truly puts the 'I' for Innovation in our MedStar Health SPIRIT values,\" said Christine R. Wray, FACHE, president of MedStar St. Mary's Hospital. \"She is detail-oriented, compassionate, and always seeking to do what is best for our patients.\" During COVID-19, Jessica helped establish Telemetry as an expansion of the Intensive Care Center to accommodate patient acuity and increasing demands. This provided flexibility and options for patient care at a time when the hospital census\u2014and stress levels\u2014were high. She was instrumental in sharing rapidly- changing protocols and precautions with the nursing staff, and developed job aids to educate nurses on the management of newly-approved medications during the pandemic. Jessica seeks out ways to deliver more efficient, patient-centered care by never settling for the status quo. She served as a subject matter expert and superuser during our hospital's recent transition to MedConnect, MedStar Health's electronic health record, and continues to be a go-to resource for colleagues. Jessica also leads by example, serving as a mentor for new-to-practice nurses. The annual Peabody Award is named for the late Elinor Peabody, dedicated volunteer with the St. Mary's Hospital Auxiliary and advocate of our community hospital. The honor is typically announced during the annual Associate Awards Banquet in May. During COVID-19, Jessica's award was celebrated in an online presentation on behalf of the Auxiliary. 18 | Healthy Living Summer 2021 Healthy Living Summer 2021 | 19Spring 2021 calendar Support groups Bariatric Support Meetings are currently online only June 12, July 10, Aug. 14, 10 a.m. Call 301-475-6019.
