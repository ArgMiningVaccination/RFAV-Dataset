I just felt good. My brain fog was gone, and I just found it really worth it. I would definitely recommend this cleanse as a way to jumpstart good health and clean eating.\" -Natalie H. (Stanwood, WA) \"I did well on the [cleanse] and to my surprise, I lost about eight pounds. What a great side effect! I was a little apprehensive about how it would taste. So I was happy when I found it pleasant-tasting and satisfying. I have participated in the cleanse twice since 2015 and will probable do so again.\" "}
