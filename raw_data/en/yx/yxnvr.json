These circles are led by experienced individual healers who are embedded in the community and use their lived experiences, expertise and training to facilitate a welcoming, safe and comfortable environment for participants to express themselves. These healing circles, organized in partnership with the City of Saint Paul, are at the center of the county's trial response plan and one of the ways we support the health and wellbeing of our community during these difficult times. We cannot understate the impact the trials in Minneapolis and the events surrounding them may have on the well-being of our communities - particularly our communities of color - regardless of the ultimate outcomes. Conversations will not be recorded, and attendees do not need to share any personal data to participate.
