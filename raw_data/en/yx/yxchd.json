CONTROL TESTS CARRIED OUT AT INTERMEDIATE STAGES OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS The dossier shall include particulars relating to the product control tests that may be carried out at an intermediate stage of the manufacturing process, with a view to ensuring the consistency of the technical characteristics and the productionprocess. These tests are essential for checking the conformity of the veterinary medicinal product with the formula when, exceptionally, an applicant proposes an analytical method for testing the finished product which does not include theassay of all the active substances (or of all the excipient components subject to the same requirements as the activesubstances). The same applies where the quality control of the finished product depends on in-process control tests, particularly if the substance is essentially defined by its manufacturing method. Where an intermediate product may be stored prior to further processing or primary assembly, a shelf life for the intermediate product shall be defined on the basis of the data resulting from stability studies. E. TESTS ON THE FINISHED PRODUCT For the control of the finished product, a batch of a finished product comprises all the units of a pharmaceutical form which are made from the same initial quantity of material and have undergone the same series of manufacturing and/orsterilisation operations or, in the case of a continuous production process, all the units manufactured in a given period oftime. The application for marketing authorisation shall list those tests, which are carried out routinely on each batch of finished product. The frequency of the tests which are not carried out routinely shall be stated. Release limits shall be indicated. The dossier shall include particulars relating to control tests on the finished product at release. They shall be submitted in accordance with the following requirements. The provisions of the relevant monographs and general chapters of the European Pharmacopoeia , or failing that, of a Member State, shall be applicable to all products defined therein. If test procedures and limits other than those mentioned in the relevant monographs and general chapters of the European Pharmacopoeia , or failing this, in the pharmacopoeia of a Member State are used, this shall be justified by providing proof that the finished product would, if tested in accordance with those monographs, meet the quality requirements of that pharmacopoeia for the pharmaceutical form concerned.EN L 44/26 Official Journal of the European Union 14.2.2009 (1) OJ C 24, 28.1.2004, p. 6.1.General characteristics of the finished product Certain tests of the general characteristics of a product shall always be included among the tests on the finished product. These tests shall, wherever applicable, relate to the control of average masses and maximum deviations, to mechanical, physical or microbiological tests, organoleptic characteristics, physical characteristics such as density, pH, refractive index.For each of these characteristics, standards and tolerance limits shall be specified by the applicant in each particular case. The conditions of the tests, where appropriate, the equipment/apparatus employed and the standards shall be described in precise details whenever they are not given in the European Pharmacopoeia or the pharmacopoeia of the Member States; the same shall apply in cases where the methods prescribed by such pharmacopoeias are not applicable. Furthermore, solid pharmaceutical forms having to be administered orally shall be subjected to in vitro studies on the liberation and dissolution rate of the active substance or substances, unless otherwise justified. Those studies shall also be carried out where administration is by another means if the competent authorities of the Member State concerned consider this necessary. 2.Identification and assay of active substance(s) Identification and assay of the active substance(s) shall be carried out either in a representative sample from the production batch or in a number of dosage units analysed individually. Unless there is appropriate justification, the maximum acceptable deviation in the active substance content of the finished product shall not exceed \u00b1 5 % at the time of manufacture. On the basis of the stability tests, the manufacturer shall propose and justify maximum acceptable deviation limits in the active substance content of the finished product up to the end of the proposed shelf life. In certain cases of particularly complex mixtures, where assay of active substances which are very numerous or present in very low amounts would necessitate an intricate investigation difficult to carry out in respect of each production batch,the assay of one or more active substances in the finished product may be omitted, on the express condition that suchassays are made at intermediate stages in the production process. This simplified technique may not be extended to the characterisation of the substances concerned. It shall be supplemented by a method of quantitative evaluation, enabling the competent authority to have the conformity of the medicinal product with its specification verified after it has beenplaced on the market. Anin vivo orin vitro biological assay shall be obligatory when physico-chemical methods cannot provide adequate information on the quality of the product. Such an assay shall, whenever possible, include reference materials and statistical analysis allowing calculation of confidence limits. Where these tests cannot be carried out on the finishedproduct, they may be performed at an intermediate stage, as late as possible in the manufacturing process. Where degradation occurs during manufacture of the finished product, the maximum acceptable levels of individual and total degradation products immediately following manufacture shall be indicated. Where the particulars given in Section B show that a significant overage of an active substance is employed in the manufacture of the medicinal product or where the stability data show that the assay of the active substance declines onstorage, the description of the control tests on the finished product shall include, where appropriate, the chemical and, if necessary, the toxico-pharmacological investigation of the changes that this substance has undergone, and possibly the characterisation and/or assay of the degradation products.EN 14.2.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 44/273.Identification and assay of excipient components An identification test and an upper and lower limit test shall be obligatory for each individual antimicrobiological preservative and for any excipient that is liable to affect the bioavailability of the active substance, unless the bioavail\u00ad ability is guaranteed by other appropriate tests. An identification test and an upper limit test shall be obligatory for anyantioxidant and for any excipient liable to adversely affect physiological functions, with a lower limit test also included forantioxidants at time of release. 4.Safety tests Apart from the toxico-pharmacological tests submitted with the application for marketing authorisation, particulars of safety tests, such as sterility and bacterial endotoxins, shall be included in the analytical particulars wherever such tests must be undertaken as a matter of routine in order to verify the quality of the product. F. STABILITY TEST 1.Active substances(s) A retest period and storage conditions for the active substance shall be specified except in the case where the active substance is the subject of a monograph in the European Pharmacopoeia and the manufacturer of the finished product fully retests the active substance immediately before its use in the manufacture of the finished product. Stability data shall be presented to support the defined retest period and storage conditions. The type of stability studies conducted, protocols used, the analytical procedures used and their validation together with the detailed results shall bepresented. The stability commitment with a summary of the protocol shall be provided. However, where a Certificate of Suitability for the active substance from the proposed source is available and specifies a retest period and storage conditions, stability data for the active substance from that source are not required. 2.Finished product A description shall be given of the investigations by which the shelf life, the recommended storage conditions and the specifications at the end of the shelf life proposed by the applicant have been determined. The type of stability studies conducted, protocols used, the analytical procedures used and their validation together with the detailed results shall be presented. Where a finished product requires reconstitution or dilution prior to administration, details of the proposed shelf life and specification for the reconstituted/diluted product are required, supported by relevant stability data. In the case of multi-dose containers, where relevant, stability data shall be presented to justify a shelf life for the product after it has been broached for the first time and an in-use specification shall be defined. Where a finished product is liable to give rise to degradation products, the applicant shall declare these and indicate the identification methods and test procedures. The conclusions shall contain the results of analyses, justifying the proposed shelf life and if appropriate, the in-use shelf life, under the recommended storage conditions and the specifications of the finished product at the end of the shelf life, and in-use shelf life if appropriate, of the finished product under these recommended storage conditions. The maximum acceptable level of individual and total degradation products at the end of shelf life shall be indicated.A study of the interaction between product and container shall be submitted wherever the risk of such interaction is regarded as possible, especially where injectable preparations are concerned.EN L 44/28 Official Journal of the European Union 14.2.2009The stability commitment with a summary of the protocol shall be provided. G. OTHER INFORMATION Information relating to the quality of the veterinary medicinal product not covered in the previous sections may be included in the dossier. For medicated premixes (products intended for incorporation into medicated feedingstuffs), information shall be provided on inclusion rates, instructions for incorporation, homogeneity in-feed, compatibility/suitable feedingstuffs, stability in-feed, and the proposed in-feed shelf life. A specification for the medicated feedingstuffs, manufactured using these pre- mixes in accordance with the recommended instructions for use shall also be provided. PART 3: SAFETY AND RESIDUES TESTS The particulars and documents which shall accompany the application for marketing authorisation pursuant to the second and fourth indents of Article 12(3)(j) shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements below. A.Safety tests CHAPTER I: PERFORMANCE OF TESTSThe safety documentation shall show: (a) the potential toxicity of the veterinary medicinal product and any dangerous or undesirable effects which may occur under the proposed conditions of use in animals; these should be evaluated in relation to the severity of thepathological condition concerned; (b) the potential harmful effects to man of residues of the veterinary medicinal product or substance in foodstuffs obtained from treated animals and what difficulties these residues may create in the industrial processing of foodstuffs; (c) the potential risks which may result from the exposure of human beings to the veterinary medicinal product, for example during its administration to the animal; (d) the potential risks for the environment resulting from the use of the veterinary medicinal product.All results shall be reliable and valid generally. Whenever appropriate, mathematical and statistical procedures shall be used in designing the experimental methods and in evaluating the results. Additionally, information shall be provided regarding the therapeutic potential of the product and about the hazards connected with its use. In some cases it may be necessary to test the metabolites of the parent compound where these represent the residues of concern. An excipient used in the pharmaceutical field for the first time shall be treated like an active substance.1.Precise identification of the product and of its active substance(s) \u2014international non-proprietary name (INN), \u2014International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry Name (IUPAC), \u2014Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number, \u2014therapeutic, pharmacological and chemical classification,EN 14.2.2009 Official Journal of European Union L 44/29\u2014synonyms and abbreviations, \u2014structural formula, \u2014molecular formula, \u2014molecular weight, impurity, \u2014qualitative and quantitative composition of impurities, \u2014description of physical properties, \u2014melting point, \u2014boiling point, \u2014vapour pressure, \u2014solubility in water and organic solvents expressed in g/l, with indication of temperature, \u2014density, \u2014spectra of refraction, rotation, etc, \u2014formulation of the product. 2.Pharmacology Pharmacological studies are of fundamental importance in clarifying the mechanisms by which the veterinary medicinal product produces its therapeutic effects and therefore pharmacological studies conducted in experimental and targetspecies of animal shall be included in Part 4. However, pharmacological studies may also assist in the understanding of toxicological phenomena. Moreover, where a veterinary medicinal product produces pharmacological effects in the absence of a toxic response, or at doses lower than those required to elicit toxicity, these pharmacological effects shall be taken into account during the evaluation of the safety of the veterinary medicinal product. Therefore the safety documentation shall always be preceded by details of pharmacological investigations undertaken in laboratory animals and all relevant information observed during clinical studies in the target animal. 2.1. Pharmacodynamics Information on the mechanism of action of the active substance(s) shall be provided, together with information on primary and secondary pharmacodynamic effects in order to assist in the understanding of any adverse effects in the animal studies. 2.2. Pharmacokinetics Data on the fate of the active substance and its metabolites in the species used in the toxicological studies shall be provided, covering absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME). The data shall be related to the dose/effect findings in the pharmacological and toxicological studies, to determine adequate exposure. Comparison with thepharmacokinetic data obtained in the studies on the target species, Part 4, Chapter I, Section A.2, shall be included in Part 4 in order to determine the relevance of the results obtained in the toxicology studies for the toxicity to the target species. 3.Toxicology The documentation on toxicology shall follow the guidance published by the Agency on the general approach to testing and guidance on particular studies. This guidance includes:EN L 44/30 Official Journal of the European Union 14.2.20091. basic tests required for all new veterinary medicinal products for use in food-producing animals in order to assess the safety of any residues present in food for human consumption; 2. additional tests that may be required depending on specific toxicological concerns such as those associated with the structure, class, and mode of action of the active substance(s); 3. special tests which might assist in the interpretation of data obtained in the basic or additional tests. The studies shall be conducted with the active substance(s), not with the formulated product. Where studies of the formulated product are required, this is specified in the text below. 3.1. Single-dose toxicity Single-dose toxicity studies may be used to predict: \u2014the possible effects of acute overdosage in the target species, \u2014the possible effects of accidental administration to humans, \u2014the doses which may usefully be employed in the repeat dose studies. Single-dose toxicity studies should reveal the acute toxic effects of the substance and the time course for their onset and remission. The studies to be carried out shall be selected with a view to providing information on user safety, e.g. if substantial exposure by inhalation or dermal contact of the user of the veterinary medicinal product is anticipated, those routes of exposure shall be studied. 3.2. Repeat-dose toxicity Repeat-dose toxicity tests are intended to reveal any physiological and/or pathological changes induced by repeated administration of the active substance or combination of active substances under examination, and to determine howthese changes are related to dosage. In the case of pharmacologically active substances or veterinary medicinal products intended solely for use in non-food- producing animals, a repeat-dose toxicity study in one species of experimental animal shall normally be sufficient. Thisstudy may be replaced by a study conducted in the target animal. The frequency and route of administration, and the duration of the study shall be chosen having regard to the proposed conditions of clinical use. The investigator shall give his reasons for the extent and duration of the trials and the dosages chosen. In the case of substances or veterinary medicinal products intended for use in food-producing animals, repeat-dose (90 day) toxicity testing shall be performed in a rodent and a non-rodent species in order to identify target organs andtoxicological endpoints and identify the appropriate species and the dose levels to be used in chronic toxicity testing, if appropriate. The investigator shall give his reasons for the choice of species, having regard to the available knowledge of the metabolism of the product in animals and man. The test substance shall be administered orally. The investigator shall clearly state and give his reasons for the method and frequency of administration and the length of the trials. The maximum dose should normally be selected so as to bring harmful effects to light. The lowest dose level should not produce any evidence of toxicity.EN 14.2.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 44/31Evaluation of the toxic effects shall be based on observation of behaviour, growth, haematology and physiological tests, especially those relating to the excretory organs, and also on autopsy reports and accompanying histological data. The choice and range of each group of tests depends on the species of animal used and the state of scientific knowledge at thetime. In the case of new combinations of known substances which have been investigated in accordance with the provisions of this Directive, the repeat-dose tests may, except where toxicity tests have demonstrated potentiation or novel toxic effects, be suitably modified by the investigator, who shall submit his reasons for such modifications. 3.3. Tolerance in the target species A summary shall be provided of any signs of intolerance which have been observed during studies conducted, usually with the final formulation, in the target species in accordance with the requirements of Part 4, Chapter I, Section B. The studies concerned, the dosages at which the intolerance occurred and the species and breeds concerned shall be identified.Details of any unexpected physiological changes shall also be provided. The full reports of these studies shall be includedin Part 4. 3.4. Reproductive toxicity including developmental toxicity 3.4.1. S t u d y o f t h e e f f e c t s o n r e p r o d u c t i o nThe purpose of this study is to identify possible impairment of male or female reproductive function or harmful effects on progeny resulting from the administration of the veterinary medicinal products or substance under investigation. In the case of pharmacologically active substances or veterinary medicinal products intended for use in food-producing animals, the study of the effects on reproduction shall be performed in the form of a multi-generation reproduction study, designed to detect any effect on mammalian reproduction. These include effects on male and female fertility, mating,conception, implantation, ability to maintain pregnancy to term, parturition, lactation, survival, growth and developmentof the offspring from birth through to weaning, sexual maturity and the subsequent reproductive function of the offspring as adults. At least three dose levels shall be used. The maximum dose should be selected so as to bring harmful effects to light. The lowest dose level should not produce any evidence of toxicity. 3.4.2. S t u d y o f d e v e l o p m e n t a l t o x i c i t y In the case of pharmacologically active substances or veterinary medicinal products intended for use in food-producing animals, tests on developmental toxicity shall be performed. These tests shall be designed to detect any adverse effects on the pregnant female and development of the embryo and foetus consequent to exposure of the female from implantationthrough gestation to the day before predicted birth. Such adverse effects include enhanced toxicity relative to thatobserved in non-pregnant females, embryo-foetal death, altered foetal growth, and structural changes to the foetus. A developmental toxicity test in the rat is required. Depending on the results, a study in a second species may have to be performed, in accordance with established guidance. In the case of pharmacologically active substances or veterinary medicinal products not intended for use in food producing animals, a study of developmental toxicity shall be performed in at least one species, which may be the target species, if the product is intended for use in female animals which may be used for breeding. However, where the use of the veterinary medicinal product would result in significant exposure to users, standard developmental toxicitystudies shall be performed. 3.5. Genotoxicity Tests for genotoxic potential shall be performed to reveal changes which a substance may cause in the genetic material of cells. Any substance intended to be included in a veterinary medicinal product for the first time must be assessed forgenotoxic properties. A standard battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests in accordance with established guidance shall usually be carried out on the active substance(s). In some cases, it may also be necessary to test one or more metabolites that occur as residues in foodstuffs.EN L 44/32 Official Journal of the European Union 14.2.20093.6. Carcinogenicity The decision on whether carcinogenicity testing is required shall take into account the results of genotoxicity tests, structure-activity relationships and the findings in systemic toxicity tests that may be relevant to neoplastic lesions in longer term studies. Any known species specificity of the mechanism of toxicity shall be considered, as well as any differences in metabolism between the test species, target animal species, and human beings. Where carcinogenicity testing is necessary, generally a two-year rat study and an 18-month mouse study are required. With appropriate scientific justification, carcinogenicity studies may be carried out in one rodent species, preferably therat. 3.7. Exceptions Where a veterinary medicinal product is intended for topical use, systemic absorption shall be investigated in the target animal species. If it is proved that systemic absorption is negligible, the repeated dose toxicity tests, the tests forreproductive toxicity and the carcinogenicity tests may be omitted, unless: \u2014under the intended conditions of use laid down, oral ingestion of the veterinary medicinal product by the animal is to be expected, or \u2014under the intended conditions of use laid down, exposure of the user of the veterinary medicinal product by other routes than the dermal route is to be expected, or \u2014the active substance or metabolites may enter foodstuffs obtained from the treated animal. 4.Other requirements 4.1. Special studies For particular groups of substances or if the effects observed during repeated dose studies in animals include changes indicative of e.g. immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity- or, endocrine dysfunction, further testing shall be required, e.g. sensi\u00adtisation studies or delayed neurotoxicity tests. Depending on the nature of the product, it may be necessary to conduct additional studies to assess the underlying mechanism of the toxic effect or the irritation potential. Such studies shall usually be conducted with the final formulation. The state of scientific knowledge and established guidance shall be taken into account when designing such studies and evaluating their results. 4.2. Microbiological properties of residues 4.2.1. P o t e n t i a l e f f e c t s o n t h e h u m a n g u t f l o r a The potential microbiological risk presented by residues of antimicrobial compounds for the human intestinal flora shall be investigated in accordance with established guidance. 4.2.2. P o t e n t i a l e f f e c t s o n t h e m i c r o o r g a n i s m s u s e d f o r i n d u s t r i a l f o o d p r o c e s s i n g In certain cases, it may be necessary to carry out tests to determine whether microbiologically active residues may interfere in technological processes in the industrial processing of foodstuff. 4.3. Observations in humans Information shall be provided showing whether the pharmacologically active substances of the veterinary medicinal product are used as medicinal products in human therapy; if this is so, a compilation shall be made of all the effectsobserved (including adverse reactions) in humans and of their cause, to the extent that they may be important for theassessment of the safety of the veterinary medicinal product, where appropriate including results from published studies; where constituents of the veterinary medicinal products are themselves not used or are no longer used as medicinal products in human therapy, the reasons shall be stated.EN 14.2.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 44/334.4. Development of resistance Data on the potential emergence of resistant bacteria of relevance for human health are necessary in the case of veterinary medicinal products. The mechanism of the development of such resistance is particularly important in this regard. Where necessary, measures to limit resistance development from the intended use of the veterinary medicinal product shall beproposed. Resistance relevant for clinical use of the product shall be addressed in accordance with Part 4. Where relevant, cross reference shall be made to the data set out in Part 4. 5.User safety This section shall include a discussion of the effects found in the preceding sections and relate this to the type and extent of human exposure to the product with a view to formulating appropriate user warnings and other risk managementmeasures. 6.Environmental risk assessment 6.1. Environmental risk assessment of veterinary medicinal products not containing or consisting of genetically modified organisms An environmental risk assessment shall be performed to assess the potential harmful effects, which the use of the veterinary medicinal product may cause to the environment and to identify the risk of such effects. The assessment shall also identify any precautionary measures which may be necessary to reduce such risk. This assessment shall normally be conducted in two phases. The first phase of the assessment shall always be performed. The details of the assessment shall be provided in accordance with accepted guidance. It shall indicate the potential exposure of the environment to the product and the level of risk associated with any such exposure taking into account in particular the following items: \u2014the target animal species, and the proposed pattern of use, \u2014the method of administration, in particular the likely extent to which the product will enter directly into environ\u00ad mental systems, \u2014the possible excretion of the product, its active substances or relevant metabolites into the environment by treated animals; persistence in such excreta, \u2014the disposal of unused veterinary medicinal product or other waste product. In the second phase, further specific investigation of the fate and effects of the product on particular ecosystems shall be conducted, in accordance with established guidance. The extent of exposure of the product to the environment, and theavailable information about the physical/chemical, pharmacological and/or toxicological properties of the substance(s)concerned, including metabolites in case of an identified risk, which has been obtained during the conduct of the other tests and trials required by this Directive, shall be taken into consideration. 6.2. Environmental risk assessment for veterinary medicinal products containing or consisting of genetically modified organisms In the case of a veterinary medicinal product containing or consisting of genetically modified organisms the application shall also be accompanied by the documents required under Article 2 and Part C of Directive 2001/18/EC. CHAPTER II: PRESENTATION OF PARTICULARS AND DOCUMENTS The dossier of safety tests shall include the following: \u2014an index of all studies included in the dossier,EN L 44/34 Official Journal of the European Union 14.2.2009\u2014a statement confirming that all data known by the applicant at the time of submission, whether favourable or unfavourable, are included, \u2014a justification for the omission of any type of study, \u2014an explanation of the inclusion of an alternative type of study, \u2014a discussion of the contribution that any study that pre-dates studies performed in line with good laboratory practice (GLP) according to Directive 2004/10/EC can make to the overall risk assessment.

B.Residue tests CHAPTER I: PERFORMANCE OF TESTS1.Introduction For the purposes of this Annex, the definitions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 ( 1) shall apply. The purpose of studying the depletion of residues from the edible tissues or of eggs, milk and honey derived from treated animals is to determine under what conditions and to what extent residues may persist in foodstuffs produced from theseanimals. In addition, the studies shall enable the determination of a withdrawal period. In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in food-producing animals, the residue documentation shall show: 1. to what extent, and how long, do residues of the veterinary medicinal product or its metabolites persist in the edible tissues of the treated animal or in milk, eggs and/or honey obtained therefrom; 2. that in order to prevent any risk to the health of the consumer of foodstuffs from treated animals, or difficulties in the industrial processing of foodstuffs, it is possible to establish realistic withdrawal periods which can be observed under practical farming conditions; 3. that the analytical method(s) used in the residues depletion study are sufficiently validated to provide the necessary reassurance that the residues data submitted are suitable as the basis for a withdrawal period.EN 14.2.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 44/35 (1) OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 1.2.Metabolism and residue kinetics 2.1.

The full study report does not need to be submitted. The purpose of pharmacokinetic studies with respect to residues of veterinary medicinal products is to evaluate the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the product in the target species. The final product, or a formulation, which has comparable characteristics in terms of bioavailability as the final product, shall be administered to the target animal species at the maximum recommended dose. Having regard to the method of administration, the extent of absorption of the veterinary medicinal product shall be fully described. If it is demonstrated that systemic absorption of products for topical application is negligible, further residue studies will not be required. The distribution of the veterinary medicinal product in the target animal shall be described; the possibility of plasma protein binding or passage into milk or eggs and of the accumulation of lipophilic compounds shall be considered. The pathways for the excretion of the product from the target animal shall be described. The major metabolites shall be identified and characterised. 2.2. Depletion of residues The purpose of these studies, which measure the rate at which residues deplete in the target animal after the last administration of the medicinal product, is to permit the determination of withdrawal periods. At a sufficient number of times after the test animal has received the final dose of the veterinary medicinal product, the quantities of residues present shall be determined by validated analytical methods; the technical procedures and the reliability and sensitivity of the methods employed shall be specified. 3.Residue analytical method The analytical method(s) used in the residues depletion study (studies) and its (their) validation shall be described in detail.

The analytical method shall be presented in an internationally agreed format. CHAPTER II: PRESENTATION OF PARTICULARS AND DOCUMENTS 1.Identification of the product An identification of the veterinary medicinal product(s) used in the testing shall be provided, including: \u2014composition, \u2014the physical and chemical (potency and purity) test results for the relevant batch(es), \u2014batch identification, \u2014relationship to the final product, \u2014specific activity and radio-purity of labelled substances, \u2014position of labelled atoms in the molecule. The dossier of residue tests shall include:\u2014an index of all studies included in the dossier, \u2014a statement confirming that all data known by the applicant at the time of submission, whether favourable or unfavourable, are included, \u2014a justification for the omission of any type of study, \u2014an explanation of the inclusion of an alternative type of study, \u2014a discussion of the contribution that any study that pre-dates GLP can make to the overall risk assessment, \u2014a withdrawal period proposal. Each study report shall include: \u2014a copy of the study plan (protocol), \u2014a statement of compliance with good laboratory practice, where applicable, \u2014a description of the methods, apparatus and materials used, \u2014a description of the results obtained, in sufficient detail to allow the results to be critically evaluated independently of their interpretation by the author, \u2014a statistical analysis of the results where appropriate, \u2014a discussion of the results, \u2014an objective discussion of the results obtained, and proposals concerning the withdrawal periods necessary to ensure that no residues which might constitute a hazard for consumers are present in foodstuffs obtained from treated animals.EN 14.2.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 44/37PART 4: PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL TRIAL The particulars and documents, which shall accompany applications for marketing authorisations pursuant to the third indent of Article 12(3)(j) shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements below. CHAPTER I: PRE-CLINICAL REQUIREMENTS Pre-clinical studies are required to establish the pharmacological activity and the tolerance of the product. A.Pharmacology A.1. Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamic effects of the active substance(s) included in the veterinary medicinal product shall be characterised. First, the mechanism of action and the pharmacological effects on which the recommended application in practice is based shall be adequately described. The results shall be expressed in quantitative terms (using, for example, dose-effect curves, time-effect curves, etc.) and, wherever possible, in comparison with a substance the activity of which is well known. Where a higher efficacy is being claimed for an active substance, the difference shall be demonstrated and shownto be statistically significant. Secondly, an overall pharmacological assessment of the active substance shall be provided, with special reference to the possibility of secondary pharmacological effects. In general, the effects on the main body functions shall be investigated. Any effect of the other characteristics of the products (such as the route of administration or formulation) on the pharmacological activity of the active substance shall be investigated. The investigations shall be intensified where the recommended dose approaches a dose likely to produce adverse reactions. The experimental techniques, unless they are standard procedures, shall be described in such detail as to allow them to be reproduced, and the investigator shall establish their validity. The experimental results shall be set out clearly and, for certain types of tests, their statistical significance quoted. Unless good reasons are given to the contrary, any quantitative modification of responses resulting from repeated administration of the substance shall also be investigated. Fixed combinations may be prompted either on pharmacological grounds or by clinical indications. In the first case, the pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic studies shall demonstrate those interactions, which might make the combin\u00adation itself of value in clinical use. In the second case, where scientific justification for the medicinal combination issought through clinical experimentation, the investigation shall determine whether the effects expected from the combin\u00ad ation can be demonstrated in animals and, at least, the importance of any adverse reactions shall be checked. If a combination includes a new active substance, the latter shall have been previously studied in depth. A.2. Development of resistance Where relevant, data on the potential emergence of resistant organisms of clinical relevance are necessary for veterinary medicinal products. The mechanism of the development of such resistance is particularly important in this regard. Measures to limit resistance development from the intended use of the veterinary medicinal product shall be proposed by the applicant. Where relevant, cross reference shall be made to data set out in Part 3. A.3. Pharmacokinetics Basic pharmacokinetic data concerning a new active substance are required in the context of assessment of the clinical safety and efficacy of the veterinary medicinal product.EN L 44/38 Official Journal of the European Union 14.2.2009The objectives of pharmacokinetic studies in the target animal species can be divided into three main areas: (i) descriptive pharmacokinetics leading to the determination of basic parameters.; (ii) use of these parameters to investigate the relationships between dosage regimen, plasma and tissue concentration over time and pharmacological, therapeutic or toxic effects; (iii) where appropriate, to compare the kinetics between different target species and to explore possible species differences having an impact on target animal safety and efficacy of the veterinary medicinal product. In the target animal species, pharmacokinetic studies are, as a rule, necessary as a complement to the pharmacodynamic studies to support the establishment of effective dosage regimens (route and site of administration, dose, dosing interval, number of administrations, etc.). Additional pharmacokinetic studies may be required to establish dosage regimensaccording to certain population variables. Where pharmacokinetic studies have been submitted under Part 3 cross reference to such studies may be made.In the case of new combinations of known substances which have been investigated in accordance with the provisions of this Directive, pharmacokinetic studies of the fixed combination are not required if it can be justified that theadministration of the active substances as a fixed combination does not change their pharmacokinetic properties. Appropriate bioavailability studies shall be undertaken to establish bioequivalence:\u2014when comparing a reformulated veterinary medicinal product with the existing one, \u2014where necessary for the comparison of a new method or route of administration with an established one. B.Tolerance in the target animal species The local and systemic tolerance of the veterinary medicinal product shall be investigated in the target animal species. The purpose of these studies is to characterise signs of intolerance and to establish an adequate margin of safety using therecommended route(s) of administration. This may be achieved by increasing the therapeutic dose and/or the duration of treatment. The report on the trials shall contain details of all expected pharmacological effects and all adverse reactions. CHAPTER II: CLINICAL REQUIREMENTS 1.General principles The purpose of clinical trials is to demonstrate or substantiate the effect of the veterinary medicinal product after administration at the proposed dosage regimen via the proposed route of administration and to specify its indicationsand contra-indications according to species, age, breed and sex, its directions for use as well as any adverse reactions which it may have. Experimental data shall be confirmed by data obtained under normal field conditions. Unless justified, clinical trials shall be carried out with control animals (controlled clinical trials). The efficacy results obtained should be compared with those from the target animal species that have received a veterinary medicinal product authorised in the Community for the same indications for use in the same target animal species, or a placebo or notreatment. All the results obtained, whether positive or negative, shall be reported. Established statistical principles shall be used in protocol design, analysis and evaluation of clinical trials, unless justified.EN 14.2.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 44/39In the case of a veterinary medicinal product intended primarily for use as a performance enhancer, particular attention shall be given to: 1. the yield of animal produce, 2. the quality of animal produce (organoleptic, nutritional, hygienic and technological qualities), 3. nutritional efficiency and growth of target animal species, 4. general health status of the target animal species. 2.Conduct of clinical trials All veterinary clinical trials shall be conducted in accordance with a detailed trial protocol.

Where immunological veterinary medicinal products consist of live organisms, especially those, which could be shed by vaccinated animals, the potential risk to unvaccinated animals of the same or of any other potentially exposed species shall be evaluated.EN 14.2.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 44/49The safety studies shall be carried out in the target species. The dose to be used shall be the quantity of the product to be recommended for use and the batch used for safety testing shall be taken from a batch or batches produced according to the manufacturing process described in Part 2 of the application. In the case of an immunological veterinary medicinal products containing a live organism, the dose to be used in the laboratory tests described in Sections B.1 and B.2 shall be the quantity of the product containing the maximum titre. Ifnecessary the concentration of the antigen may be adjusted to achieve the required dose. For inactivated vaccines the doseto be used shall be that quantity recommended for use containing the maximum antigen content unless justified. The safety documentation shall be used for assessment of the potential risks which may result from the exposure of human beings to the veterinary medicinal product, for example during its administration to the animal. B. LABORATORY TESTS 1.Safety of the administration of one dose The immunological veterinary medicinal product shall be administered at the recommended dose and by each recom\u00ad mended route of administration to animals of each species and category in which it is intended for use, including animalsof the minimum age of administration. The animals shall be observed and examined for signs of systemic and local reactions. Where appropriate, these studies shall include detailed post-mortem macroscopic and microscopic examinations of the injection site. Other objective criteria shall be recorded, such as rectal temperature and performance measurements. The animals shall be observed and examined until reactions may no longer be expected, but in all cases, the observation and examination period shall be at least 14 days after administration. This study may be part of the repeated dose study required under point 3 or omitted if the results of the overdose study required under point 2 have revealed no signs of systemic or local reactions. 2.Safety of one administration of an overdose Only live immunological veterinary medicinal products require overdose testing. An overdose of the immunological veterinary medicinal product shall be administered by each recommended route(s) of administration to animals of the most sensitive categories of the target species, unless the selection of the most sensitive of several similar routes is justified. In the case of immunological veterinary medicinal products administered by injection, the doses and route(s) of administration shall be chosen to take account of the maximum volume, which can beadministered at any one single injection site. The animals shall be observed and examined for at least 14 days after administration for signs of systemic and local reactions. Other criteria shall be recorded, such as rectal temperature and performance measurements. Where appropriate, these studies shall include detailed post-mortem macroscopic and microscopic examinations of the injection site if this has not been done under point 1. 3.Safety of the repeated administration of one dose In the case of immunological veterinary medicinal products to be administered more than once, as part of the basic vaccination scheme, a study of the repeated administration of one dose shall be required to reveal any adverse effects induced by such administration. These tests shall be carried out on the most sensitive categories of the target species (such as certain breeds, age groups), using each recommended route of administration. The animals shall be observed and examined for at least 14 days after the last administration for signs of systemic and local reactions. Other objective criteria shall be recorded, such as rectal temperature and performance measurements.EN L 44/50 Official Journal of the European Union 14.2.20094.Examination of reproductive performance Examination of reproductive performance shall be considered when data suggest that the starting material from which the product is derived may be a potential risk factor. Reproductive performance of males and non-pregnant and pregnant females shall be investigated with the recommended dose and by the most sensitive route of administration. In addition,harmful effects on the progeny, as well as teratogenic and abortifacient effects, shall be investigated. These studies may form part of the safety studies described in points 1, 2, 3 or of the field studies provided for in Section C. 5.Examination of immunological functions Where the immunological veterinary medicinal product might adversely affect the immune response of the vaccinated animal or of its progeny, suitable tests on the immunological functions shall be carried out. 6.Special requirements for live vaccines 6.1. Spread of the vaccine strain Spread of the vaccine strain from vaccinated to unvaccinated target animals shall be investigated, using the recommended route of administration most likely to result in the spread. Moreover, it may be necessary to investigate the spread to non- target animal species which could be highly susceptible to a live vaccine strain. 6.2. Dissemination in the vaccinated animal Faeces, urine, milk, eggs, oral, nasal and other secretions shall be tested for the presence of the organism as appropriate. Moreover, studies may be required of the dissemination of the vaccine strain in the body, with particular attention being paid to the predilection sites for replication of the organism. In the case of live vaccines for zoonoses within the meaning of Directive 2003/99/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1) to be used for food producing animals, these studies must shall take particularly into account the persistence of the organism at the injection site. 6.3. Reversion to virulence of attenuated vaccines Reversion to virulence shall be investigated with the master seed. If the master seed is not available in sufficient quantity the lowest passage seed used for the production shall be examined. Use of another passage option shall be justified. The initial vaccination shall be carried out using the route of administration most likely to lead to reversion to virulence. Serialpassages shall be made in target animals through five groups of animals, unless there is justification to make morepassages or the organism disappears from the test animals sooner. Where the organism fails to replicate adequately, as many passages as possible shall be carried out in the target species. 6.4. Biological properties of the vaccine strain Other tests may be necessary to determine as precisely as possible the intrinsic biological properties of the vaccine strain (e.g. neurotropism). 6.5. Recombination or genomic reassortment of strains The probability of recombination or genomic reassortment with field or other strains shall be discussed. 7.User safety This section shall include a discussion of the effects found in the preceding sections, which shall relate those effects to the type and extent of human exposure to the product with a view to formulating appropriate user warnings and other risk management measures.EN 14.2.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 44/51 (1) OJ L 325, 12.12.2003, p. 31.8.Study of residues For immunological veterinary medicinal products, it will normally not be necessary to undertake a study of residues. However, where adjuvants and/or preservatives are used in the manufacture of immunological veterinary medicinal products, consideration shall be given to the possibility of any residue remaining in the foodstuffs. If necessary, theeffects of such residues shall be investigated. A proposal for a withdrawal period shall be made and its adequacy shall be discussed in relation to any residue studies which have been undertaken. 9.Interactions If there is a compatibility statement with other veterinary immunological products in the summary of product character\u00ad istics the safety of the association shall be investigated. Any other known interactions with veterinary medicinal products shall be described. C. FIELD STUDIES Unless justified, results from laboratory studies shall be supplemented with data from field studies, using batches according to the manufacturing process described in the marketing authorisation application. Both safety and efficacymay be investigated in the same field studies. D. ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENT The purpose of the environmental risk assessment is to assess the potential harmful effects, which the use of the product may cause to the environment and to identify any precautionary measures, which may be necessary to reduce such risks. This assessment shall normally be conducted in two phases. The first phase of the assessment shall always be performed. The details of the assessment shall be provided in accordance with established guidance. It shall indicate the potential exposure of the environment to the product and the level of risk associated with any such exposure, taking into account in particular the following items: \u2014the target animal species and the proposed pattern of use, \u2014the method of administration, in particular the likely extent to which the product will enter directly into the environmental system, \u2014the possible excretion of the product, its active substances into the environment by treated animals, persistence in such excreta, \u2014the disposal of unused or waste product. In the case of live vaccine strains which may be zoonotic, the risk to humans shall be assessed. Where the conclusions of the first phase indicate potential exposure of the environment to the product, the applicant shall proceed to the second phase and evaluate the potential risk(s) that the veterinary medicinal product might pose to the environment. Where necessary, further investigations on the impact of the product (soil, water, air, aquatic systems, non-target organisms) shall be carried out.EN L 44/52 Official Journal of the European Union 14.2.2009E. ASSESSMENT REQUIRED FOR VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS CONTAINING OR CONSISTING OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS In the case of veterinary medicinal products containing or consisting of genetically modified organisms the application shall also be accompanied by the documents required under Article 2 and Part C of Directive 2001/18/EC.

The welfare of the trial animals shall be subject to veterinary supervision and shall be taken fully into consideration during the elaboration of any trial protocol and throughout the conduct of the trial. Pre-established systematic written procedures for the organisation, conduct, data collection, documentation and verifi\u00ad cation of efficacy trials shall be required. Field trials shall be conducted in accordance with established principles of good clinical practice, unless otherwise justified. Before the commencement of any field trial, the informed consent of the owner of the animals to be used in the trial shall be obtained and documented. In particular, the animal owner shall be informed in writing of the consequences ofparticipation in the trial for the subsequent disposal of treated animals or for the taking of foodstuffs from treated animals. A copy of this notification, countersigned and dated by the animal owner, shall be included in the trial documentation. Unless the field trial is conducted with a blind design, the provisions of Articles 55, 56 and 57 shall apply by analogy to the labelling of formulations intended for use in veterinary field trials. In all cases, the words \"for veterinary field trial use only \"shall appear prominently and indelibly upon the labelling. CHAPTER II A.General requirements 1. The choice of antigens or vaccine strains shall be justified on the basis of epizoological data. 2. Efficacy trials carried out in the laboratory shall be controlled trials, including untreated control animals unless this is not justified for animal welfare reasons and efficacy can be otherwise demonstrated. In general, these laboratory trials shall be supported by trials carried out in field conditions, including untreated control animals. All trials shall be described in sufficiently precise details so as to be reproducible in controlled trials, carried out at the request of the competent authorities. The investigator shall demonstrate the validity of all the techniques involved. All results obtained, whether favourable or unfavourable, shall be reported.EN 14.2.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 44/533. The efficacy of an immunological veterinary medicinal product shall be demonstrated for each category of target animal species recommended for vaccination, by each recommended route of administration and using the proposed schedule of administration. The influence of passively acquired and maternally derived antibodies on the efficacy of avaccine shall be adequately evaluated, if appropriate. Unless justified, the onset and duration of immunity shall beestablished and supported by data from trials. 4. The efficacy of each of the components of multivalent and combined immunological veterinary medicinal products shall be demonstrated. If the product is recommended for administration in combination with or at the same time as another veterinary medicinal product, they shall be shown to be compatible. 5. Whenever a product forms part of a vaccination scheme recommended by the applicant, the priming or booster effect or the contribution of the veterinary immunological product to the efficacy of the scheme as a whole shall be demonstrated. 6. The dose to be used shall be the quantity of the product to be recommended for use and the batch used for efficacy testing shall be taken from a batch or batches produced according to the manufacturing process described in Part 2 ofthe application. 7. If there is a compatibility statement with other immunological products in the summary of product characteristics, the efficacy of the association shall be investigated. Any other known interactions with any other veterinary medicinalproducts shall be described. Concurrent or simultaneous use may be allowed if supported by appropriate studies. 8. For diagnostic immunological veterinary medicinal products administered to animals, the applicant shall indicate how reactions to the product are to be interpreted. 9. For vaccines intended to allow a distinction between vaccinated and infected animals (marker vaccines), where the efficacy claim is reliant on in vitro diagnostic tests, sufficient data on the diagnostic tests shall be provided to allow adequate assessment of the claims related to the marker properties. B.Laboratory trials 1. In principle, demonstration of efficacy shall be undertaken under well-controlled laboratory conditions by challenge after administration of the immunological veterinary medicinal product to the target animal under the recommendedconditions of use. Insofar as possible, the conditions under which the challenge is carried out shall mimic the naturalconditions for infection. Details of the challenge strain and its relevance shall be provided. For live vaccines, batches containing the minimum titre or potency shall be used unless justified. For other products, batches containing the minimum active content shall be used unless otherwise justified. 2. If possible, the immune mechanism (cell-mediated/humoral, local/general classes of immunoglobulin) which is initiated after the administration of the immunological veterinary medicinal product to target animals by the recommended route of administration shall be specified and documented. C.Field trials 1. Unless justified, results from laboratory trials shall be supplemented with data from field trials, using batches rep\u00ad resentative of the manufacturing process described in the marketing authorisation application. Both safety and efficacymay be investigated in the same field study. 2. Where laboratory trials cannot be supportive of efficacy, the performance of field trials alone may be acceptable.EN L 44/54 Official Journal of the European Union 14.2.2009PART 5: PARTICULARS AND DOCUMENTS A.

TITLE III REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIC MARKETING AUTHORISATION APPLICATIONS 1.Generic veterinary medicinal products Applications based on Article 13 (generic veterinary medicinal products) shall contain the data referred to in Parts 1 and 2 of Title I of this Annex together with an environmental risk assessment and data demonstrating that the product has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substances and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinal product and data showing bio-equivalence with the reference medicinal product. If the reference veterinarymedicinal product is a biological medicinal product, the documentation requirements in Section 2 for similar biologicalveterinary medicinal products shall be fulfilled. For generic veterinary medicinal products the detailed and critical summaries on safety and efficacy shall particularly focus on the following elements: \u2014the grounds for claiming essential similarity, \u2014a summary of impurities present in batches of the active substance(s) as well as those of the finished medicinal product (and where relevant decomposition products arising during storage) as proposed for use in the product to be marketed together with an evaluation of these impurities, \u2014an evaluation of the bio-equivalence studies or a justification as to why studies were not performed with reference to established guidance, \u2014if applicable, additional data in order to demonstrate the equivalence of safety and efficacy properties of different salts, esters or derivatives of an authorised active substance shall be provided by the applicant; those data shall includeevidence that there is no change in the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties of the therapeutic moietyand/or in toxicity, which could influence the safety/efficacy profile. Every claim in the summary of product characteristics not known from or inferred from the properties of the medicinal product and/or its therapeutic group should be discussed in the non-clinical/clinical overviews/summaries andsubstantiated by published literature and/or additional studies. For generic veterinary medicinal products intended to be administered by intramuscular, subcutaneous or transdermal routes, the following additional data shall be provided: \u2014evidence to demonstrate equivalent or differing depletion of residues from the administration site, which may be substantiated by appropriate residue depletion studies, \u2014evidence to demonstrate target animal tolerance at the administration site, which may be substantiated by appropriate target animal tolerance studies. 2.Similar biological veterinary medicinal products In accordance with Article 13(4), where a biological veterinary medicinal product which is similar to a reference biological veterinary medicinal product does not meet the conditions in the definition of generic medicinal product, information tobe supplied shall not be limited to Parts 1 and 2 (pharmaceutical, chemical and biological data), supplemented with bio- equivalence and bioavailability data. In such cases, additional data shall be provided, in particular on the safety and efficacy of the product.EN 14.2.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 44/57\u2014The type and amount of additional data (i.e. toxicological and other safety studies and appropriate clinical studies) shall be determined on a case-by-case basis in accordance with relevant scientific guidelines. \u2014Due to the diversity of biological veterinary medicinal products, the competent authority shall determine the necessary studies foreseen in Parts 3 and 4, taking into account the specific characteristic of each individual biological veterinarymedicinal product. The general principles to be applied shall be addressed in guideline which shall be adopted by the Agency, taking into account the characteristics of the concerned biological veterinary medicinal product. If the reference biological veterinarymedicinal product has more than one indication, the efficacy and safety of the biological veterinary medicinal product claimed to be similar shall be justified or, if necessary, demonstrated separately for each of the claimed indications. 3.Well-established veterinary use For veterinary medicinal products the active substance(s) of which has/have been in \"well-established veterinary use \"as referred to in Article 13a, with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety, the following specific rules shall apply. The applicant shall submit Parts 1 and 2 as described in Title I of this Annex. For Parts 3 and 4, a detailed scientific bibliography shall address all aspects of the safety and efficacy. The following specific rules shall apply in order to demonstrate the well-established veterinary use:3.1. The following factors shall be taken into account in order to establish a well-established veterinary medicinal use of constituents of veterinary medicinal products: (a) the time over which an active substance has been used;(b) quantitative aspects of the use of the active substance; (c) the degree of scientific interest in the use of the active substance (reflected in the published scientific literature); (d) the coherence of scientific assessments. Different periods of time may be necessary for establishing well-established use of different substances. In any case, however, the period of time required for establishing a well-established veterinary use of a constituent of a medicinalproduct shall not be less than ten years from the first systematic and documented use of that substance as a veterinary medicinal product in the Community. 3.2. The documentation submitted by the applicant shall cover all aspects of the safety and/or efficacy assessment of the product for the proposed indication in the target species using the proposed route of administration and dosageregimen. It must include or refer to a review of the relevant literature, taking into account pre- and post-marketing studies and published scientific literature concerning experience in the form of epidemiological studies and in particular of comparative epidemiological studies. All documentation, both favourable and unfavourable, shall becommunicated. With respect to the provisions on well-established veterinary use, it is in particular necessary toclarify that bibliographic reference to other sources of evidence (post-marketing studies, epidemiological studies etc.) and not just data related to tests and trials may serve as a valid proof of safety and efficacy of a product if an application explains and justifies the use of these sources of information satisfactorily.EN L 44/58 Official Journal of the European Union 14.2.20093.3. Particular attention must be paid to any missing information and justification must be given as to why demonstration of an acceptable level of safety and/or efficacy can be supported although some studies are lacking. 3.4. The detailed and critical summaries regarding safety and efficacy must explain the relevance of any data submitted which concern a product different from the product intended for marketing. A judgement must be made whether ornot the product studied can be considered as similar to the product, for which application for a marketingauthorisation has been made in spite of the existing differences. 3.5. Post-marketing experience with other products containing the same constituents is of particular importance and applicants shall put a special emphasis on this issue. 4.Combination veterinary medicinal products For applications based on Article 13b, a dossier containing Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall be provided for the combination veterinary medicinal product. It shall not be necessary to provide studies on the safety and efficacy of each activesubstance. It shall nevertheless be possible to include information on the individual substances in the application for afixed combination. The submission of data on each individual active substance, in conjunction with the required user safety studies, residues depletion studies and clinical studies on the fixed combination product, may be considered a suitable justification for omitting data on the combination product, based on animal welfare grounds and unnecessarytesting on animals, unless there is suspected interaction leading to added toxicity. Where applicable, information regardingthe manufacturing sites and the safety evaluation of adventitious agents shall be provided. 5.Informed consent applications Applications based on Article 13c shall contain the data described in Part 1 of Title 1 of this Annex, provided that the marketing authorisation holder for the original veterinary medicinal product has given the applicant his consent to referto the content of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of the dossier of that product. In this case, there is no need to submit quality, safetyand efficacy detailed and critical summaries. 6.Documentation for applications in exceptional circumstances A marketing authorisation may be granted subject to certain specific obligations requiring the applicant to introduce specific procedures, in particular concerning the safety and efficacy of the veterinary medicinal product, when, as provided for in Article 26(3) of this Directive, the applicant can show that he is unable to provide comprehensive data on theefficacy and safety under normal conditions of use. The identification of essential requirements for all applications mentioned in this section should be subject to guidelines which shall be adopted by the Agency. 7.Mixed marketing authorisation applications Mixed marketing authorisation applications are applications where Part(s) 3 and/or 4 of the dossier consist of safety and efficacy studies carried out by the applicant as well as bibliographical references. All other part(s) are in accordance withthe structure described in Part I of Title I of this Annex. The competent authority shall accept the proposed formatpresented by the applicant on a case-by-case basis. TITLE IV REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKETING AUTHORISATION APPLICATIONS FOR PARTICULAR VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS This part lays down specific requirements for identified veterinary medicinal products related to the nature of the active substances contained therein.EN 14.2.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 44/591.IMMUNOLOGICAL VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS A. VACCINE ANTIGEN MASTER FILEFor particular immunological veterinary medicinal products and by derogation from the provisions of Title II, Part 2 Section C on active substances, the concept of a Vaccine Antigen Master File is introduced. For the purpose of this Annex, a Vaccine Antigen Master File means a stand-alone part of the marketing authorisation application dossier for a vaccine, which contains all relevant information on quality concerning each of the active substances, which are part of this veterinary medicinal product. The stand-alone part may be common to one ormore monovalent and/or combined vaccines presented by the same applicant or marketing authorisation holder. Scientific guidelines for the submission and evaluation of a vaccine antigen master file shall be adopted by the Agency. The procedure for the submission and evaluation of a vaccine antigen master file shall follow the guidance published bythe Commission in The rules governing medicinal products in the European Union , Volume 6B, Notice to Applicants. B. MULTI-STRAIN DOSSIER For certain immunological veterinary medicinal products (foot-and-mouth disease, avian influenza and bluetongue) and by derogation from the provisions of Title II, Part 2 Section C on active substances the concept of the use of a multi-straindossier is introduced. A multi-strain dossier means a single dossier containing the relevant data for a unique and thorough scientific assessment of the different options of strains/combinations of strains permitting the authorisation of vaccines against antigenicallyvariable viruses. Scientific guidelines for the submission and evaluation of multi-strain dossiers shall be adopted by the Agency. The procedure for the submission and evaluation of multi-strain dossiers shall follow the guidance published by theCommission in The rules governing medicinal products in the European Union , Volume 6B, Notice to Applicants. 2.HOMEOPATHIC VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS This section sets out specific provisions on the application of Title I, Parts 2 and 3 to homeopathic veterinary medicinal products as defined in Article 1(8). Part 2 The provisions of Part 2 shall apply to the documents submitted in accordance with Article 18 in the simplified registration of homeopathic veterinary medicinal products referred to in Article 17(1) as well as to the documents forauthorisation of other homeopathic veterinary medicinal products referred to in Article 19(1) with the following modi\u00ad fications. (a)Terminology The Latin name of the homeopathic stock described in the marketing authorisation application dossier shall be in accordance with the Latin title of the European Pharmacopoeia or, in absence thereof, of an official pharmacopoeia of a Member State. Where relevant the traditional name(s) used in each Member State shall be provided. (b)Control of starting materials The particulars and documents on the starting materials, i.e. all of the materials used including raw materials and intermediates up to the final dilution to be incorporated into the finished homeopathic veterinary medicinal product, accompanying the application shall be supplemented by additional data on the homeopathic stock.EN L 44/60 Official Journal of the European Union 14.2.2009The general quality requirements shall apply to all of the starting and raw materials as well as intermediate steps of the manufacturing process up to the final dilution to be incorporated into the finished homeopathic product. Where a toxic component is present, this should be controlled if possible in the final dilution. However, if this is not possible because ofthe high dilution, the toxic component shall normally be controlled at an earlier stage. Every step of the manufacturingprocess from the starting materials up to the final dilution to be incorporated into the finished product must be fully described. In case dilutions are involved, these dilution steps shall be done in accordance with the homeopathic manufacturing methods laid down in the relevant monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia or, in absence thereof, in an official pharmacopoeia of a Member State. (c)Control tests on the finished medicinal product The general quality requirements shall apply to the homeopathic finished veterinary medicinal products. Any exception shall be duly justified by the applicant. Identification and assay of all the toxicologically relevant constituents shall be carried out. If it can be justified that identification and/or an assay on all the toxicologically relevant constituents is not possible e.g. due to their dilution inthe finished medicinal product the quality shall be demonstrated by complete validation of the manufacturing anddilution process. (d)Stability tests The stability of the finished product shall be demonstrated. Stability data from the homeopathic stocks are generally transferable to dilutions/potentisations obtained thereof. If no identification or assay of the active substance is possibledue to the degree of dilution, stability data of the pharmaceutical form may be considered. Part 3The provisions of Part 3 shall apply to the simplified registration of homeopathic veterinary medicinal products referred to in Article 17(1) of this Directive with the following specification, without prejudice to the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for substances included in the homeopathic stocks intended for administration to food-producinganimal species. Any missing information must be justified, e.g. justification must be given why demonstration of an acceptable level of safety can be supported although some studies are lacking.
